24 INTRODUCTION

25 1. The Respondent CITY OF LOS ANGELES ("Respondent" or "City") began its

26 consideration of development entitlements for a 12-story, 176,580 square foot Eldercare Facility
27

28
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 containing up to 53 senior independent units, 77 assisted living care units, 46

2 Alzheimer's/dementia care units, and associated residential amenity and service areas; a new

3 2,520 square foot fellowship hall; and a new 19,703 square foot childcare facility and
4 administrative office space/multi-purpose group space (collectively, "the Project") at 10822
5
Wilshire Boulevard and 10812 Ashton Avenue (the "Subject Property"). 6

7 2. City's formal approval consisted of a determination by the City Council that the

8 Project qualified for streamlined environmental analysis as a Sustainable Communities

9 Environmental Assessment ("SCEA") under the Public Resources Code Sections of the California

10 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). That approval occurred on or about May 18, 2021. City

11 decided not to file or provide any notice of this CEQA determination until it had competed its
12 decision making process regarding a series of three entitlement including an Eldercare Permit, a
13
concluded on
14 Conditional Use Permit, Site Plan Review and Vesting Tract Map. That process was

15 or about February 22, 2022. Petitioner is informed and believes that the City has ore soon will file

16 Notice of Determination (*NOD") with the County Recorder regarding the approval of the

17 Project by means of a SCEA and that soon thereafter the NOD was or will be posted.

18 3. As set forth herein, the City's findings and analysis with regard to the Project
19 entitlements, including the SCEA, are incorrect; are not unsupported by substantial evidence and

20 law; and violate both state law as well as the City's own Municipal Code ("LAMC").

21 4. In approving the Project the City erroneously found that the Project presented

22 sufficient evidence that the strict application of the land use regulations on the subject property

23 would result in practical difficulties and unnecessary hardships inconsistent with the general

24 purpose and intent of the zoning regulations; that the Project will not create an adverse impact on

25 street access or circulation in the surrounding neighborhood; and that the Project's location, size
26 height, operations and other significant features will be compatible with and not adversely affect

27 or further degrade adjacent properties, the surrounding neighborhood or the public health,

28
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 welfare, and safety.

2 5. For all of the reasons set forth herein, the City's approvals of the Project, including
the SCEA, should be set aside.

JURISDICTION

6. This Court has jurisdiction over the instant action under §§1085 and 1094.5 of the
Code of Civil Procedure, and §§21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.
PARTIES

7. Petitioner, DANA ZINDERMAN ("Petitioner"), is a resident of the neighborhood
in the community of Westwood, California, a well-recognized geographic area within the west
side of the City of Los Angeles. As a resident in the vicinity of the Project, Petitioner is
10 beneficially interested in the subject matter sought to be resolved by this Petition.
11 8. Respondent City is a municipal corporation, organized and existing under the laws
12 of the state of California, located within the County of Los Angeles. The City has the duty and
13 responsibility to proceed in accordance with law, provide due process and ensure that all
14 discretionary approvals comply with all applicable laws, including CEQA. Public Resources Code

15 §21000 et. seq-; and 14 Cal. Code Regs. §15000 et. seq.

16 9. "Belmont Village Senior Living," is the name used on the application for the

17 Project. Petitioner is informed, believes and thereon alleges that Belmont Village Senior Living is

18 not a legal entity but rather an operating arm of BELMONT VILLAGE, L.P., a Limited

19 Partnership, duly organized under the laws of the state of Delaware, and currently doing business

20 1n the County of Los Angeles. Petitioner's best information is that BELMONT VILLAGE, L.P is

21 an owner or otherwise interested party of certain real property rights necessary for the

22 development, which Petitioner is informed and believes is a long-term exclusive lease for the

23 Subject Property and will is an interested party in the operation of the Project and for these

24 reasons is Real Party in Interest in this Petition.

10.
25 Petitioner is informed, believes and thereon alleges that Real Party in Interest

26 WESTWOOD PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH OF LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, a California
Corporation, is a corporation, duly organized under the laws of the state of California, doing
27
3
28
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 business within the County of Los Angeles, and is the owner of the Subject Property on which the

2 Project is proposed.

3 11. Collectively, Real Parties in Interest BELMONT VILLAGE, L.P. and

4 WESTWOOD PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH OF LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA will be
referred as the "Real Parties."

12.
6 Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Respondents or other Real
Parties in Interest sued herein as DOES 1-20, inclusive, and ROES 1-20, inclusive, and, therefore,
sue these individuals and/or entities by such fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this Petition
to allege the true names and capacities of fictitiously named parties when ascertained. Petitioner is
9 informed, believes and thereon alleges that each party designated herein as a DOE and/or a ROE
10
is responsible for the events and happenings alleged in this Petition or has a beneficial interest in
11 the discretionary actions challenged herein.
12 13. Petitioner is informed, believes and thereon alleges that at all times herein
13 mentioned, Respondents or other Real Parties in Interest, and each of them, were the agents,
14 servants, employees, partners, and alter egos of the remaining Respondents or other Real Parties
15 in Interest, that the acts complained of herein were done within the course and scope of said
16 agency, service, employment, and partnership, and that the acts by each Respondent or other Real

17 Party in Interest were ratified, approved and adopted by each of the remaining Respondents or

18 Real Parties in Interest. Wherever the terms "Respondents," "Real Parties in Interest," or "Real

19 Parties" is used herein, it shall mean "Respondents and/or other Real Parties in Interest, and each

20 of them."

21 STATEMENT OF FACTS

22 14. The Project is proposed on real property consisting of approximately 1.62-acres

23 located at 10822 W. Wilshire Boulevard and 10812 W. Ashton Avenue within the Westwood

24 Community Plan area of the City (the "Subject Property").
15.
25 The northern portion of the Subject Property, identified as 10822 Wilshire

26 Boulevard, is located within the boundaries of the Wilshire-Westwood Scenic Corridor Specific

27 Plan ("Specific Plan"), which establishes development standards that supersede the LAMC. That

28
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 northern portion, fronting Wilshire Boulevard, is improved with a church sanctuary, preschool,
2 administrative offices, a fellowship hall, ancillary spaces, with surface parking areas behind.

3 16. The southeastern portion of the Subject Property, known as 10812 Ashton Avenue,

4 is improved with a single-family residence and additional surface parking areas used by the Real

5 Party Church for a children's day a care facility.

6 17. The Project proposes demolition of the existing preschool, administrative offices,

7 fellowship hall, paved parking areas, and the single-family residence to be replaced by the

8 proposed Eldercare Facility, more or less in the northern portion of the Specific Property and a
Childcare Facility and Church and school administration in the southeastern portion of the Subject
9
Property. The existing church, located on the northerly most portion of the Subject Property, will
10
remain.
11 18. On or about June 14, 2018, Real Parties filed applications Case Nos. ZA-2018-
12 3422-ELD-CU-DRB-SPP-SPR and VTT-82107 ("the Entitlements") with the City's Department
13 of City Planning (*Planning Department") seeking various entitlements required by law to
14 develop the Project. Real Parties' application included entitlement requests for (i) Eldercare

15 Facility Unified Permit including deviations from LAMC and Specific Plan requirements; (ii) a
16 Conditional Use to allow a preschool and church administrative offices within the R1 Zone; (iii) a

17 Conditional Use for a list of deviations in connection with the proposed preschool, including a

18 maximum building height of 34 feet in lieu of 28 feet, reduced side yard setbacks, and a

19 residential floor area of 19,567 square feet in lieu of the 7,442 permitted; (iv) Site Plan Review

20 for the development of 50 or more dwelling units or guest rooms; (v) Design Review and Project

21 Permit Compliance under the Specific Plan; (vi) and a Vesting Tentative Tract Map to create

22 three ground lots and multiple commercial condominium units (the "Project Entitlements").

23 19. In connection with the Project Entitlement Cases, Real Parties also filed a separate

24 application in Case No. ENV-2018-3423-EAF seeking appropriate environmental review of the

25 Project under CEQA.

20.
26 The Planning Department concluded that the Project qualified as a "Transit

27 Priority Project" ("TPP") under the requirements of Public Resources Code Sections 21155 and

5
28 PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 21155.2 (the use of the term "Section(s)" shall be references to the Public Resources Code)

2 and/or a qualified "residential or mixed use residential project" that satisfied the requirements of

3 Section 21159.28(d) of the PRC, and although the Project could have a potentially significant
effect on the environment, there would not be a significant effect because the SCEA identified
measures that either avoided a or mitigated to a level of insignificance all potentially significant or

6 significant effects of the Project.

21. On or about November 12, 2020, the Planning Department issued a Notice of
Availability of the SCEA, the City's proposed environmental documents under CEQA, providing
the opportunity for public comment until December 14, 2020.

22. City's proposed environmental documents under CEQA included an Initial Study
10 and an Environmental Analysis under the SCEA that identified several substantive environmental
11 issues of which the Project had the potential to negatively impact the environment, including and
12 noise. The SCEA also conclusively determined less than significant impact on several
13 environmental issues, including aesthetics and transportation.
14 23. In or about February, 2021, the City prepared and circulated for the public an

15 erratum to the SCEA with "technical corrections and clarifications." In that erratum, City

16 determined that these technical corrections and clarifications modifications were minor, that they

17 merely clarified and refined the SCEA, that they provided supplemental information about the

18 Project and that the erratum did not disclose any new or significant environmental impact that

19 would result from the Project, nor identified any new or different mitigation measures resulting in

20 new significant effects under Section CEQA.

21 24. Opponents of the Project, the former including the Petitioner, submitted comment

22 letters outlining several deficiencies of the SCEA, the supporting documentation relied on by

23 Respondents in relying on SCEA to comply with CEQA and other substantive and procedural

24 deficiencies in the Respondent's approval process as described in detail below.
25.
25 On or about May 4, 2021, the Planning and Land Use Management Committee

26 (*PLUM Committee"), a standing committee of the City Council, met at a regularly scheduled

27 hearing to consider the SCEA. Members of the public, including Petitioner, appeared and spoke

6
28
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 against the Project and the SCEA. After taking testimony and closing the public hearing, the

2 PLUM Committee recommended approval of the SCEA, the Erratum, a [proposed] Mitigation

3 Monitoring and Reporting Program ("MMRP") prepared for the SCEA, and the draft findings for

4 the Project, and certified CEQA compliance under CEQA.

5 26. On or about May 18, 2021, the City Council adopted the PLUM Committee's
recommendation.

27. Between on or about June 9, 2021, and on or about February 23, 2022, the City, by

8 its various decision makers reviewed, considered, and held hearings on the ZA-2018-3422-ELD-
CU-DRB-SPP-SPR and CEQA No. ENV-2019-5735-SCEA (the SCEA document adopted by the
9
City Council), VTT-82107 sought by Real Party in Interest (hereinafter referred to as the
10 "Entitlements") to authorize the Project. on or about February 23, 2022, the City Council
11 approved all of the Entitlements
12 28. On or about February 23, 2022, the City Council adopted the PLUM Committee's
13 report and recommendation without further public hearing.
14 29. The City's actions, as set forth hereinabove, constitute a final action of the

15 Respondent to approve the Project Entitlements and adopt the SCEA.
16 30. Opponents of the Project, including the Petitioner, objected during the
17 administrative process, including submitting letters, filing appeals and testifying during public

18 hearings, specifically to the Respondent's determination that the Project qualifies for

19 environmental review under the provisions for SCEA for the reasons set forth below; and to the

20 entitlements on the basis that they relied on the erroneous determination that the entitlements

21 could be reviewed and supported by the SCEA. Thereby Petitioner exhausted all available

22 administrative remedies.

23 31. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

24 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate and injunctive relief.
32.
25 Unless the City and Real Parties are restrained and enjoined from the issuance of

26 grading and building permits as well as any construction of the Project before the Court's

27 determination on the merits in this action, Petitioner and the general public will suffer great and

7
28
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 irreparable harm. Further, without injunctive relief, Petitioner would be denied its rightful

2 remedies if the Project was allowed to proceed with development and thereafter the Court

3 determines that the SCEA and Project approvals shall be set aside on any of the grounds asserted

4 herein.

5 33. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code §21167.5 by providing the

6 City with notice of intention to commence the within action. [Exhibit A].

7 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION - VIOLATIONS OF CEQA

8 34. In the regular session of the California State Legislature, it adopted "The

9 Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act of 2008, commonly known as Senate Bill
10 No. 375 ("SB 375") which sought to integrate transportation and land use planning to reduce
11

12 greenhouse gas emissions ("GHG".)

13 35. The reductions mandated by SB 375 may be achieved through a variety of means,
14
including 'smart growth' planning to maximize building densities at locations served by public
15

16 transit and to locate residences near needed services and shopping to reduce automobile

17 dependency."

18
36.
19 One type of development the Legislature determined can help reduce GHG

20 emissions from motor vehicles is a transit priority project (referred to herein as a "TPP.") By

21 definition provided in CEQA, a TPP is a development project that contains at least 50 percent

22 residential use, provides a minimum density of at least 20 units per acre, and is located within

23 one-half mile of a major transit stop or transit corridor.

24

25 37. To encourage the development of TPPs, SB 375 limited the extent of

26 environmental review that a local agency must perform under CEQA before approving a TPP.

27

28
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 Provided the record demonstrates that a proposed development 1) qualifies as a TPP and it is:

2 (2) "is consistent with the general use designation, density, building intensity, and applicable

3 policies specified for the project area; and (3) project approval incorporates a) all feasible
4 mitigation measures, b) performance standards, and c) criteria set forth "in the prior applicable
5
environmental impact reports" and which were adopted as findings, then CEQA allows the local
6

7 agency to review the project's environmental effects in a streamlined manner using SCEA.

8
38. Nothing in Senate Bill 375 transfers land use authority away from the local
9

10 agency who remains solely responsible for the exercise of the police powers over local land use

11 decisions. However, the commitment by the State to meaningfully address climate change by,

12 among other things, reducing GHG and the State's on-going commitment to avoid or mitigate

13 wherever feasible significant environmental impacts under CEQA, remain statewide interests

14 which can conflict with the local interests.

15

16
39.
17 Public Resources Code §§21000-21177, commonly known as "CEQA," imposes

18 on all public agencies, including in this case Respondents, a duty to investigate and wherever

19 feasible to mitigate to a level of insignificance all of the environmental impacts of projects

20 within their respective jurisdictions before approving any project, as defined by CEQA, CEQA

21 imposes many substantive and procedural duties which all of the Respondents must comply with

22 to ensure that all projects subject to its respective jurisdictions have incorporated all feasible
23 measures that can mitigate identified environmental impacts and where not feasible, that a
24

25 statement of overriding considerations is adopted justifying such approval. Each of these actions

26 must be supported by substantial evidence in the record before it.

27

9
28
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 40. Failure to comply with the substantive requirements of CEQA or to carry out the

2 full CEQA procedures SO that complete information of a project's impacts is developed and

3 publicly disclosed constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion that requires invalidation of the

4 public agency action regardless of whether full compliance would have produced a different
5
result.
6

41. At issue in this Petition is Respondent's approval of the Real Parties' Project.

8 A residential project qualified to apply for TPP status is defined in the Public Resources

9 Code $ 21159.25 as follows:

10 (a) For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
11

12 (1) "Residential or mixed-use housing project" means a project consisting of
multifamily residential uses only or a mix of multifamily residential and

13 nonresidential uses, with at least two-thirds of the square footage of the development designated for residential use. (Emphasis has been added.)
14
42. The Project consists of at least 4 different land uses: a) a church; b) an eldercare
15

16 facility consisting of i) independent living, ii) assisted living; iii) Alzheimer/dementia care; and

17 ancillary uses such as a dining facility and assembly hall; c) childcare facility; and d) church

18 administration. Based on the application materials submitted by the RPI, the Project does not

19 meet the threshold criteria to be a TPP that requires that a development project contain at least 50

20 percent residential use.

21 43. In enacting SB 375 the Legislature intended SCEA to apply to projects in which

22 the dominant land use is residential in character. A clear example of what the Legislature

23 contemplated is a multi-family apartment building or land use of a similar character that will

24 generate persons likely to use transit.

25 44. Because the Legislature expressed a very clear purpose behind allowing SCEA
26 review that is premised on increased transit use as a part of the State's strategy to decrease GHG
27
10
28
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 emissions, the Legislature did not intend as broad a definition of SCEA as Respondents have

2 relied on to determine the Project may be reviewed as a SCEA.

3 45. The Project consists of land uses that are not residential in character as the

4 Legislature intended to quality for SCEA review, including without limitation a dining hall and

5 social hall and other land uses which Respondents improperly assumed were sufficiently

6 residential in character under SCEA, including Assisted Living and Alzheimer care, which by
7 definition will not generate transit use and therefore do not comply with the required, and
8 intended, and therefore qualifying land uses necessary to meet the required residential use land
9
use minimum threshold requirements.
10
46. Said another way, Respondent has assumed, without providing substantial
11

12 evidence in the record, that its total land use mix, including approximately 74,231 square feet for

13 Assisted Living and Alzheimer care, meets the intended residential land use character required to

14 allow Respondent to review the Project using SCEA.

15 47. Instead, the record demonstrates that the non-qualifying land uses add up to
16 approximately two-thirds of the total area of the Project.

17 48. The record only supports a finding that not more than one-third of the Project land

18 uses, based on the character of the proposed land uses, complies with the Legislature's minimum

19 threshold requirements regarding residential land use.

20
49.
21 The Legislative purpose of Senate Bill 375 is very clear, it is to:

22 reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles and light trucks to achieve, if there is a feasible way to do so, the greenhouse gas emission reduction
23 targets approved by the [State Air Resources Board].'

24 50. This strategy is intended to direct the location and intensity of future land

25 use development on a regional scale in coordination with transit investment in order to
26

27
11
28
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles.

3 51. The decision by the Legislature to limit use of SCEA to PROJECTS comprised of

4 predominantly residential uses as a part of its comprehensive strategy to reduce GHG emissions
could not be more clearly stated. Therefore in addition to failing the objective prerequisite

6 residential land use requirement, the Project also fails to meet the intent of the Legislature to

exempt the Project from full CEQA analysis by means of SCEA.

52. Because exceptions to rules, here the streamlining of CEQA analysis, must be

10 construed narrowly, Respondents abused their discretion by relying on SCEA for determining

11 the Project compliance with CEQA because the land use mix lies outside of the legislative
12
purposes stated in SB 375.
13

14 53. By Respondent's reliance on SCEA, opponents of the Project were prejudiced by

15 the failure to provide the normal examination of offsite alternatives, and the normal requirement
16

17 to reference, describe, or discuss a reduced residential density alternatives to address the effects

18 of car and light-duty truck trips generated by the Project

19
54. Respondent's reliance on SCEA, has prejudiced opponents of the Project by short
20

21 cuts in its environmental analysis which does not comply with the well- established principal that

22 CEQA is "to be interpreted .. . to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within

23 the reasonable scope of the statutory language."

24
55.
25 Petitioner and others raised their concerns and objections to the Project and

26 submitted substantial evidence to Respondents in advance of their decision to certify compliance

27
12
28
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 with CEQA by the SCEA that successfully challenges and therefore invalidates certain evidence

2 which Respondents incorrectly determined is substantial evidence and that Respondents
wrongfully relied on in certifying compliance with CEQA. The substantial evidence submitted
by objectors regarding the Project was not challenged, contradicted, or objected to and that
therefore it constitutes substantial evidence that use of the SCEA was improper.

56. Real Party in Interest had the burden of proof to show that it complied with the
legislative purpose and requirements to qualify for SCEA and it has failed to it meet that burden
with supporting substantial evidence.

10 57. Respondent abused its discretion by relying on its expansive allowance of varied

11 land uses within its residential zones as evidence to support its faulty determination that the land

12 use character of the Project met the 50% residential threshold requirement. Respondent's zoning

13 ordinance does not constitute substantial evidence that all of the many and varied land uses

14 allowed within its residential zones are per se residential in character. For an example, a church

15 IS allowed within Respondent's residential zone. But that does not prove that the land use

16 character of the church is a residential in character.

17 58. Respondent abused its discretion by not evaluating the functionality and character
18 of the Project's many proposed land uses in making its faulty determination that the Project met
19
the 50% residential threshold requirement to qualify for review as a SCEA.
20
59. Respondent abused its discretion by approving the Project based on a record that
21

22 does not contain adequate substantial evidence to support a finding the Project complies with

23 applicable transit use and GHG reduction policies specified for the project area in the RTP/SCS

24 prepared by SCAG.

25 60. The Land Use Chapter of the Framework Element identifies the Low Residential

26 land use designation, such as the R-1 zone, as allowing single-family dwelling uses, along with

27
13
28
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 supporting uses such as parks, schools, and community centers. The proposed approximately

2 20,000 square foot Childcare Facility Building includes about half for child care and the other

3 half for an office for Church Administration. An administrative office for a church, as proposed

4 by the Project, is not an allowable land use nor similar to one allowed within the R-1 zone.

5 Therefore, the record does not contain substantial evidence to support a finding that the

6 Childcare Facility Building portion of the Project is consistent with the General Use Designation
7 specified for the Subject Property.
8 61. The proposed floor area for the Childcare/Church Administration building is
9 approximately 19,703 square feet. Opponents submitted substantial evidence showing that the
10 average floor area of the surrounding neighborhood does not exceed 3,000 square feet.
11

12 Moreover, none of the properties within the nearby R-1 zone exceed 3,000 square feet. The

13 surrounding uses are less than 16% of the proposed floor area density of the Childcare/Church

14 Administration component of the Project. Therefore, the record does not contain substantial

15 evidence to support a finding that portion of the Project is consistent with the land use density

16 specified for the Subject Property.

17 62. The environmental impacts of the proposed Childcare Facility, serving 105 pre-

18 school children, are not the same as those created by a family living in a single-family home.

19 Real Party admits that the Project will generate a noise impact that it seeks to mitigate by seeking

20 a conditional use permit (*CUP,") zoning exception, to raise its front-yard wall from 3 ½ feet

21 6 to 6 feet in the front yard.. By definition, a CUP is required where it has been predetermined that

22 the proposed use and/or structure is incompatible in the zone. The application for and the grant

23 of the CUP constitutes substantial evidence that the proposed Childcare Facility is incompatible
24 at that location. Therefore, the record does not contain substantial evidence to support a finding
25 that portion of the Project is consistent with the land use intensity specified for the Subject
26 Property.
27
14
28 PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 63. In addition to noise, the record demonstrates an aesthetic impact will be caused by

2 that over-in-height wall and by proposing a building massing consisting of nearly 20,000 square

3 feet on the same residential block where the prevailing massing is not more than 2,500 square

4 feet. These aesthetic impacts cannot be mitigated to insignificance.

5 64. Traffic is another obvious impact which is admitted in the record by the extensive

6 signage plans to direct ingress and egress, which may mitigate to some degree, but not eliminate

7 the impact. The Project also admits traffic is an impact by its argument that the adverse impact is
8 limited in time (morning and afternoon) and in days (weekdays that are not holidays.)
9
65. Based on these three impacts plus the substantial variation between the density
10
proposed by the Project and that of the existing neighborhood, it cannot be reasonably or fairly
11

12 concluded that the proposed Childcare Facility does not "contradict or conflict with" the existing

13 single family land use of the neighborhood.

14 66. For these reasons, this required finding to qualify the Project as a TPP is not

15 supported by substantial evidence, and Respondents abused their discretion by examination of

16 the Project under CEQA as a SCEA.

17 67. Furthermore, unlike a neighborhood coffeeshop, a bodega, or a dry cleaner, all of

18 which are neighborhood serving uses, it cannot be presumed and therefore the record must

19 contain supporting data, regarding where the 105 children attending the Childcare Facility will

20 be coming from. Also, as there is no symbiosis in terms of vehicle trips between a day care

21 facility and a senior care facility. The record lacks any substantial evidence to show the childcare

22 facility will meet the Legislature's goals of reducing VMT and therefore GHG. Respondents

23 abused their discretion by not considering the purpose of SB 375 to reduce the GHG emissions
24 from automobiles to achieve, if there is a feasible way to do so, the GHG emission reduction
25 targets.
26 68. Respondent abused its discretion by certifying compliance with CEQA based on

AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 an Initial Study that is legally flawed because it omits material facts, all of which are alleged

2 herein above and below, relate to whether the Project has the potential for significant
3 environmental impacts. In developing the Project Description, all information relevant to

4 determining the potential impacts must be identified. Examples of material information that

5 should have been included in the Project Description section of the Initial Study related to

6 relevant environmental issues are as follows:

7 A. The record does not contain any information about the potential total

8 resident capacity. The Project Description should have discussed the number of beds.
9

10 Because many guest rooms have the same floor plan as a 2-bedroom dwelling, those

11 guest rooms likely will 2 have 2 (or more) residents in a room. In order to make

12 knowledgeable decisions involving the density of the Project, more information was

13 necessary regarding residential capacity.

14 B. Missing from the Project Description that is directly relevant to the

15 Legislature's purpose in enacting SB 375 are the statistics regarding the ambulatory
16

17 capacity of the users of the Project i.e., the numbers who are likely to walk to Westwood

18 Village to gain access to neighborhood services and to transit.

19 C. Also missing from the Project Description is a narrative of the

20 contemplated function(s) of the two Fellowship Halls. The number of assemblies and

21 special events and the maximum capacity for these halls are all relevant information that

22 contribute to the total impact of the Project.
23
D. What does "providing 24-hour care" for Alzheimer/dementia guests
24

25 entail? Is there licensed medical service on-site, psychiatric services, how many health

26 care workers are necessary during each shift?

27
16
28
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 E. Also missing from the Project Description is the total number of persons

2 contemplated to provide all of the many services that are intended, their hours of service,

3 the compensation for providing what appear to be low-wage work, and how that

4
compensation relates to the potential for the transportation impacts regarding the workers.
5
Opponents contend that the Project is not primarily a residential use. This information is
6

7 relevant to the consideration of this issue which Respondent have a duty to fully consider.

8 The following is a non-exhaustive list of other failures of the Initial Study to fully

9 evaluate the potential environmental impacts of the Project:

10 A. The density of the senior housing component of the Project used in the
11 Initial Study is inaccurate. Specific Plan Section 5.B. Density. States: "No building shall
12
be erected, or enlarged which exceeds a density of 100 dwelling units per acre of lot
13

14 area." Respondent's Municipal Code makes a distinction between "guest rooms", which

15 are defined by not having a kitchen and "dwelling units" which may be the exact same

16 size and even foot print of "guest rooms" but which are outfitted with a kitchen. The

17 zoning distinction between these two units are not explained anywhere in the record and

18 thus there is no substantial evidence to allow Respondent to use that artificial distinction

19 for purposes of determining compliance with CEQA. including making the determination
20

21 to evaluate the Project by means of a SCEA. Without any factual basis in support, the

22 later were arbitrarily excluded from determining whether the Project meets or exceeds the

23 maximum allowable density under the Specific Plan. The record shows that the Project

24 exceeds the density limit of 100 dwelling units per acre of lot area when taking into

25 account both form of units, i.e., eliminating the arbitrary delineation between dwelling

26 units and guest rooms, which delineation has no bearing on the requirements of Section 5.
27
17
28
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 B of the Specific Plan, Respondent has abused its discretion by certifying compliance

with CEQA based on substantial evidence showing that the Project exceeded the density

requirements set forth in the Specific Plan.

B. The Initial Study failed to apply the correct definition of the word
"conflict" contemplated by the enactment of CEQA as (see below), in concluding that

there are no land use conflicts. One unexamined "conflict" between the Project and a

8 critical and applicable plan enacted to avoid or reduce an environmental impact is the

conflict between the Project and the RTP/SCS which was enacted by the Legislature to be

10 implemented by lead agencies to promote increased transit use. As there is no substantial

11 evidence that the Project will yield meaningful transit use, the approval of the Project at
12 that site constitutes an "opportunity cost" i.e., the loss of a key site to provide high-
13

14 density multi-family proximate to a significant investment in the transit system nearby.

15 Had the Initial Study identified this adverse land use "conflict," the public and the

16 decision makers could have better evaluated the Project and the wisdom of the many

17 Entitlements granted to facilitate the Project and exempt it from the strict application of

18 the various code sections that otherwise would apply to a project at the Subject Property.
19 C. The term "consistency" is not defined as a part of SB 375. However,
20

21 because SB 375 is a part of the Legislature's legislative scheme set forth in CEQA

22 designed for environmental protection, the purposes of CEQA must dictate the purpose

23 and intention of requiring a "consistency" analysis. As the term "consistency" is required

24 in connection with SB 375 Respondent must take into account the Legislature's purpose

25 in enacting CEQA, i.e., "maximum protection for the environment," "transparency", "full

26 disclosure" regarding impacts related to the environment. Respondents did not adhere to
27
18
28 PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 this definition of the Legislature's intentions by its use of the term "consistency" when

2 Respondents made its determinations to review the Project as a SCEA for CEQA

compliance. Instead, Respondents erroneously relied on a definition that is derived from

4 the Government Code which allows a finding of "consistency" in support of a
discretionary approval a with a general plan provided the project under review is
"*consistent" with the overall intent of the plans and does not preclude the attainment of

8 its primary goals as stated in Sequoyah Hills Homeowners Association v. City of
Oakland, (1993) 23 Cal.App.4th 704, 719, This interpretation did not advance the CEQA

10 mandates of ensuring maximum protection of the environment and transparency of the

11 environmental values of the decision makers. Respondents abused their discretion by
12
relying on the improper meaning of the word "consistent" as contemplated in CEQA
13

14 when making its many determinations, including in the Initial Study, to making its

15 determination to use a SCEA to streamline its environmental evaluation of the Project

16 under CEQA.

17 D. The Initial Study states that the Project does not seek any adjustments or

18 any exceptions to applicable code requirements but rather seeks approval from the

19 Zoning Administrator under the Eldercare Facility zoning law. The Initial Study then
20

21 concludes that with these approvals, there will be no "conflict" between the project and

22 applicable plans, policies and regulations enacted for the purpose of mitigating or

23 avoiding environmental impacts. Staff lacks the power to make that determination, only

24 the Council has the authority to do so. The making of this determination at the staff level

25 eliminated the Council's consideration of this "conflict" which effectively constitutes an

26 unlawful usurpation of Council's exclusive authority.

PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 70. Without all of the relevant information to understanding the environmental

2 impacts, the analysis of that subject is stultified and the purpose of CEQA frustrated. Without

3 complete information including, without limitation, the many pieces described above, the Initial

4 Study has not fulfilled its function in the CEQA process and thereby prejudiced the Petitioner,

5 the opponents of the Project and the decision makers all of whom are entitled to complete and

6 accurate information as part of the CEQA review process and before certifying compliance with
7 CEQA.

8 71. The record reflects that Respondent's Department of Transportation made some
9 I determinations to customize their analysis of transportation impacts. But Respondents failed to
10
include any evidence in the record to explain or elaborate on that process or the elements of their
11
calculations. Without providing that information as a part of the record, Respondent has abused
12

13 its discretion in failing to provide material information for the public to review prior to

14 approving the SCEA regarding the assumptions made and the method by which it estimated

15 traffic impacts of the Project.

16 72. In taking the actions set forth herein, the Respondent has erred and/or abused its

17 discretion. The allegations contained herein were raised by Petitioner and or others who

18 expressed their concerns about the Project at one or another of the hearings in the many letters,

19 emails (both from sources outside of the City and intra-City), oral and written testimony at prior

20 hearings and community meetings, and other forms of communication that have been presented

21 in whatever form to either the City's environmental and/or planning units regardless of the

22 source or date of submittal and therefore have met the requirement to exhaust the administrative

23 remedies on the totality of the record already submitted to the City, including without limitation,

24 73. For all of the reasons set forth herein, the actions of the Respondent in approving
25 the Project constitutes prejudicial error and an abuse of discretion, not supported by substantial
26 evidence, and warrant a writ of mandamus setting aside the SCEA and the Project approvals.

1 74. As a result of the City's CEQA violations, Petitioner, other members of the public,

2 and City decision-makers have been harmed, and will continue to be harmed unless this Court

3 grants the requested relief, as they were not fully informed about the significant environmental

4 impacts of the Projects prior to the City's approval of the Project and adoption of the SCEA.

5 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment against Respondents and Real Parties, and

6 each of them, as follows:

l.
7 That this Court issue an alternative and peremptory writ of mandate directing the

8 City and its departments, to set aside and vacate the adopted SCEA for the Project;
2.
9 That this Court issue an alternative and peremptory writ of mandate directing the

10 City and its departments to set aside and vacate all Project approvals which are based upon the
inadequate SCEA;
11 3. That this Court issue a Writ of Mandamus directing the City to set aside its
12 approval of the Project and reconsider the Project in light of the Court's opinion and judgment,
13 including all City and State laws and regulations;
14 4. For a temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent injunctions
15 enjoining further construction and completion of the Project until this action can be decided on

16 the merits;

17 5. For attorneys' fees according to law, including Code of Civil Procedure §1021.5;

18 and

19 6. For such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and appropriate.
