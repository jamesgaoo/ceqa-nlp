Case 2:21-cv-00617-DWL Document 7 Filed 04/12/21 Page 2 of 19

INTRODUCTION

2 1. This is an action challenging Defendants' pervasive violations of the
3 National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 ("NEPA") as it relates to immigration

4 policy. Although those immigration policies undeniably have significant effects on the
5 environment, Defendants have not even attempted to comply with NEPA.
6 2. "NEPA "protects the environment by requiring that federal agencies
7 carefully weigh environmental considerations and consider potential alternatives to the
8 proposed action before the government launches any major federal action.'" Native Vill.
9 of Point Hope v. Jewell, 740 F.3d 489, 493 (9th Cir. 2014) (cleaned up) (emphasis
10 added). But here Defendants have embarked on multiple environmentally disruptive
11 policies without performing even cursory environmental analysis.
12 3. Since at least 1975, the Ninth Circuit has held that population growth can
13 be an environmental impact that agencies must consider under NEPA. See City of Davis
14 v. Coleman, 521 F.2d 661, 671 (9th Cir. 1975). In that case, the Court held that the
15 Federal Highway Administration violated NEPA by failing to prepare an environmental

16 impact statement ("EIS") prior to the construction of a freeway interchange near an
17 agricultural area. Id. at 666. As the Court explained in that case, "plain common sense"
18 indicated that the highway interchange was likely to cause growth in the area: "The
19 growth-inducing effects of the project are its raison d'etre, and with growth will come
20 growth's problems: increased population, increased traffic, increased pollution, and
21 increased demand for services such as utilities, education, police and fire protection, and
22 recreational facilities." Id. at 675. See also Barnes v. U.S. Dep't of Transp., 655 F.3d
23 1124, 1139 (9th Cir. 2011) (holding that, with respect to project adding a new runway to
24 an airport, "even if the stated purpose of the project is to increase safety and efficiency,
25 the agencies must analyze the impacts of the increased demand attributable to the
26 additional runway as growth-inducing effects").

Case 2:21-cv-00617-DWL Document 7 Filed 04/12/21 Page 3 of 19

F 4. Here, however, Defendants have, on information and belief, decided to
2 (1) halt construction of hundreds of miles of border wall, leaving completely arbitrary
3 gaps between physical barriers, encouraging and abetting widespread illegal migration
4 and (2) halt the "Remain in Mexico" program, enabling tens of thousands of asylum
5 claimants to enter the United Statesall without preparing an environmental impact
6 statement for any of these activities.
7 5. Each of these activities individually involves environmental consequences
8 that are far greater than construction of a single highway interchange or runway. But
9 Defendants have not prepared an EIS to consider any of them. Indeed, Defendants have
10 not even prepared environmental assessments ("EAs"), which are less fulsome
11 documents that can be employed whereunlike herethe actions at issue will not
12 "significantly affect[] the quality of the human environment[.]" 42 U.S.C. § 4332(C).
13 6. Put simply, Defendants have flouted compliance with NEPA and have not
14 even engaged in the pretense of performing any environmental analysis before taking
15 environmentally transformative actions.
16 7. NEPA, 42 U.S.C. § 4321 et seq., establishes "a national policy [to]
17 encourage productive and enjoyable harmony between man and his environment[.]" 42
18 U.S.C. § 4321. NEPA effectuates this policy by imposing procedural requirements on
19 federal agencies, and by providing that those agencies have to analyze the environmental
20 impact of all their major actions.
21 8. NEPA is "particularly" concerned with "the profound influences of
22 population growth" on the environment. Id. § 4331(a). Human population is among the
23 biggest factors in environmental change. It is "plain common sense" that the number of
24 people in an area has a significant impact on the environment, through factors such as
25 urbanization, infrastructure development, pollution, and stress on natural resources. See
26 City of Davis, 521 F.2d at 675.

2

Case 2:21-cv-00617-DWL Document 7 Filed 04/12/21 Page 4 of 19

F 9. Federal policies on immigration, asylum, refugee admission, refugee
2 resettlement, border enforcement, and temporary workers, among others, have directly
3 impacted and will continue to impact the population-and, consequently, the
4 environment-of the State of Arizona.

5 10. As Justice Holmes explained in 1907: "the state has an interest
6 independent of and behind the titles of its citizens, in all the earth and air within its
7 domain. It has the last word as to whether its mountains shall be stripped of their forests
8 and its inhabitants shall breathe pure air." Georgia v. Tenn. Copper Co., 206 U.S. 230,
9 237 (1907). Arizona has a strong interest in ensuring that policies that affect the
10 environment of the state are enacted consistent with federal law governing
11 environmental protection.
12 11. This action challenges a collection of policies of Defendants that have the
13 direct effect of causing growth in the population of Arizona through immigration
14 (collectively, "Population Augmentation Policies"), having a direct and substantial
15 impact on the environment in Arizona. Many of these environmental impacts are
16 negative, as the Ninth Circuit explained in City of Davis: "increased traffic, increased
17 pollution, and increased demand for services" all result directly from population growth.
18 See City of Davis, 521 F.2d at 675. But migration can bring positive environmental
19 effects too: for example, increased tax revenue, which enhances resources available for
20 environmental preservation.
21 12. NEPA requires that all environmental impacts of major federal actions-
22 the good, the bad, and the ambiguousbe studied prior to the government taking action.
23 See, e.g., 40 C.F.R. § 1501.3 (requiring federal agencies to consider "[b]oth beneficial
24 and adverse effects" under NEPA); 40 C.F.R. § 1508.1 (agencies must consider effects
25 "resulting from actions that may have both beneficial and detrimental effects, even if on
26 balance the agency believes that the effect will be beneficial"). But Defendants are

3

L

2 simply ignoring NEPA entirely while engaging in actions that are certain to have

3 dramatic impacts on the environment. This suit seeks to end these pervasive violations

4 and require that Defendants discharge their duties under NEPA. It further seeks to

5 compel Defendants to allow public participation in these processes, which is a central
requirement of NEPA.
6 PARTIES

24 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

18.

25 This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1346, and 1361, as

26

4

Case 2:21-cv-00617-DWL Document 7 Filed 04/12/21 Page 6 of 19

19. The Court is authorized to award the requested declaratory and injunctive
2 relief under 5 U.S.C. § 706, 28 U.S.C. § 1361, and 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202.
c 20. Venue is proper within this federal district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) §
4 because (1) Plaintiffs State of Arizona resides in Arizona and no real property is
5 involved and (2) "a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim
6 occurred" in this District.

7 LEGAL BACKGROUND

8 A. The National Environmental Policy Act
9 21. NEPA declares that "it is the continuing responsibility of the Federal
10 Government to improve and coordinate" federal programs in order to, among other
11 things, "fulfill the responsibilities of each generation as trustee of the environment for
12 succeeding generations;" "assure for all Americans safe, healthful, productive, and
13 esthetically and culturally pleasing surroundings;" and, significantly, to "achieve a
14 balance between population and resource use which will permit high standards of living
15 and a wide sharing of life's amenities[.]" 42 U.S.C. § 4331(b).
16 22. The purpose of NEPA is to "infuse" these policy goals into agency
17 decision-making. To accomplish its goals, NEPA creates a set of procedures which force
18 federal government agencies to take account of environmental concerns. Accordingly,
19 the statute provides, in relevant part, that "all agencies of the Federal Government shall"
20 consider the environmental impacts of all "proposals .. . and other major Federal actions
21 significantly affecting the quality of the human environment[.]" 42 U.S.C. § 4332.
22 23. Under NEPA, agencies must make a "detailed statement" on those
23 impacts, addressing, among other things, alternatives to the proposed action. Id. This
24 detailed statement is generally known as an environmental impact statement.
25 24. "NEPA has twin aims. First, it places upon an agency the obligation to
26 consider every significant aspect of the environmental impact of a proposed

5

Case 2:21-cv-00617-DWL Document 7 Filed 04/12/21 Page 7 of 19

F action. Second, it ensures that the agency will inform the public that it has indeed
2 considered environmental concerns in its decisionmaking process." WildEarth Guardians
3 v. Jewell, 738 F.3d 298, 302 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (citing Balt. Gas & Elec. Co. v. NRDC, 462

4 U.S. 87, 97 (1983)) (cleaned up); accord Robertson V. Methow Valley Citizens Council,
5 490 U.S. 332, 349 (1989).
6 25. NEPA thus ensures that important environmental effects will not be
7 "overlooked or underestimated[.]" Robertson, 490 U.S. at 349. The requirement to
8 evaluate environmental impacts also provides the public with information about
9 environmental impacts, assuring the public that the agency is considering the
10 environment and providing a "springboard for public comment[.]" Id. Public participation
11 under NEPA serves to improve the agency's process by ensuring that a "larger audience a
12 can provide input as necessary to the agency making the relevant decisions." See
13 Department of Transp. v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 768 (2004) (cleaned up).
14 26. NEPA's requirements "are to be strictly interpreted to the fullest extent
15 possible in accord with the policies embodied in the Act." Center for Biological
16 Diversity v. Bernhardt, 982 F.3d 723, 734 (9th Cir. 2020) (cleaned up).
17 27. Alongside these provisions, NEPA established the Council on
18 Environmental Quality ("CEQ") with authority to issue regulations to assist federal
19 agencies in administering the statute's requirements. The CEQ regulations define
20 important terms such as the "[m]ajor Federal action" and "[e]ffects or impacts[,]" 40
21 C.F.R. § 1508.1, and set up procedures for public participation in the EIS process. See,
22 e.g., 40 C.F.R. vo 1503 et seq. CEQ regulations also set forth the process for agencies to
23 use in determining whether NEPA applies or is otherwise fulfilled. See 40 C.F.R. § 1501
24 et seq.
25 28. Under existing CEQ regulations, environmental impacts should be
26 "considered early in the process in order to ensure informed decision making by Federal

6

Case 2:21-cv-00617-DWL Document 7 Filed 04/12/21 Page 8 of 19

F agencies." 40 C.F.R. § 1500.1(b). NEPA should be integrated with other planning "at the
2 earliest reasonable time to ensure that agencies consider environmental impacts in their
3 planning and decisions[ ]" 40 C.F.R. § 1501.2(a).
L 29. Agencies may identify "categories of actions" which "normally do not
5 have a significant effect on the human environment" and which therefore do not require
6 the preparation of an EIS. 40 C.F.R. § 1501.4(a) (*categorical exclusions"). Such actions
7 are exempt from environmental review, absent extraordinary circumstances.
8 30. CEQ regulations provide that agencies should prepare an Environmental
9 Assessment ("EA") for proposed actions that are not categorically excluded if those
10 actions are "not likely to have significant effects or when the significance of the effects
11 is unknown[.]" 40 C.F.R. § 1501.5(a). The EA may assist the agency in determining
12 whether to prepare a full-fledged EIS or whether to issue a finding of no significant
13 impact. 40 C.F.R. § 1501.5(b).
14 31. The regulations also state that agencies "shall evaluate in a single
15 environmental impact statement proposals or parts of proposals that are related to each
16 other closely enough to be, in effect, a single course of action." 40 C.F.R. § 1502.4(a).
17 When considering such programmatic action, agencies should consider factors such as
18 whether the relevant actions are "occurring in the same general location," and whether
19 they "have relevant similarities, such as common timing, impacts, alternatives, methods
20 of implementation, media, or subject matter." 40 C.F.R. § 1502.4(b)(1).
21 32. CEQ regulations define the "[e]ffects or impacts" that agencies must
22 consider to include "ecological (such as the effects on natural resources and on the
23 components, structures, and functioning of affected ecosystems), aesthetic, historic,
24 cultural, economic (such as the effects on employment), social, or health effects. Effects
25 may also include those resulting from actions that may have both beneficial and
26

7

Case 2:21-cv-00617-DWL Document 7 Filed 04/12/21 Page 9 of 19

F detrimental effects, even if on balance the agency believes that the effect will be
2 beneficial." 40 C.F.R. § 1508.1(g)(1).
3 B. The Administrative Procedure Act

4 33. The Administrative Procedure Act ("APA") provides for judicial review of
5 agency action. See 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq. Under the APA, a federal court reviewing
6 agency action "shall" "hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and
7 conclusions" which the court finds are "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or

g otherwise not in accordance with law."

9 34. When an agency undertakes final agency action that fails to comply with
10 NEPA, such action is unlawful and set must be aside under the APA. See Cantrell v.
11 City of Long Beach, 241 F.3d 674, 679 n.2 (9th Cir. 2001) (*Although NEPA does not
12 provide a private right of action for violations of its provisions, private parties may
13 enforce the requirements of NEPA by bringing an action against the federal agency
14 under § 10(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act.").
15 FACTUAL BACKGROUND
16 35. Defendants have undertaken a number of major federal actions which,
17 collectively and in isolation, have caused and are causing significant effects to the
18 quality of the human environment in the State of Arizona. Defendants have not prepared
19 an environmental impact statement-or even an environmental assessmentfor any of
20 these activities.

21 A. Promised Termination of Border Wall Construction

22 36. On August 5, 2020, Joe Biden declared in an NPR interview that "[t]here
23 will not be another foot of wall constructed in my administration, number one." See Lulu
Garcia-Navarro August 5, 2020, interview of Joe 24 Biden,
25 https://twitter.com/i/status/1291000306915057669; see also Barbara Sprunt, Biden Would
26 End Border Wall Construction, But Wouldn't Tear Down Trump's Additions,

2 but-wont-tear-down-trump-s-additions (last visited April 11, 2021).
c 37. He further stated, "Number 2, I'm gonna make sure that we have border
4 protection, but it's going to be based on making sure that we use high-tech capacity to
5 deal with it and at the ports of entry, that's where all the bad stuff happens." See
6 https://twitter.com/i/status/1291000306915057669 (emphasis added)
7 38. He also responded when asked about land confiscations, he responded
8 "End. Stop. Done. Over. Not gonna do it. Withdraw the lawsuits. We're out. We're not
9 gonna confiscate the land." See https://twitter.com/i/status/1291000306915057669
10 (emphasis added).
11 39. These statements by Mr. Biden, individually and collectively, show that he
12 promised to stop all new wall construction.
13 40. On January 20, 2021, President Biden, in one of his first official actions,
14 issued a proclamation directing DHS to "pause work on each construction project on the
15 southern border wall" and to "pause immediately the obligation of funds related to
16 construction of the southern border wall[.]" See Proclamation on the Termination Of
17 Emergency With Respect To The Southern Border Of The United States And Redirection
18 Of Funds Diverted To Border Wall Construction, Office of the White House (Jan. 20,
19 2021), available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-
20 actions/2021/01/20/proclamation-termination-of-emergency-with-respect-to-southern-
21 border-of-united-states-and-redirection-of-funds-diverted-to-border-wall-construction/.
22 41. This proclamation was issued without any notice and comment or
23 interagency review.
24 42. The proclamation states that Defendant Secretary Mayorkas, in
25 consultation with various other members of the cabinet and other appropriate agency and
26 department heads, "shall develop a plan for the redirection of funds concerning the

9

Case 2:21-cv-00617-DWL Document 7 Filed 04/12/21 Page 11 of 19

southern border wall[.]" Id. Contrary to this order, the plan has not yet been announced,
2 creating even greater uncertainty as to the status of the nation's border security.
c 43. The proclamation justifies its policy change in stating that "building a
4 massive wall ... is not a serious policy solution" and the wall is "a waste of money that
Un diverts attention from genuine threats to our homeland security."* Id.
6 44. DHS has implemented this proclamation by suspending all border wall
7 projects, on information and belief leaving hundreds of miles of fencing unfinished
8 compared to what DHS had studied and planned. The termination of border wall
9 construction has literally left huge holes in the border fencing, including substantial gaps
10 across the Arizona-Mexico border.

11 45. Since January 20, machinery has been literally standing idle in some areas
12 of Arizona's wilderness, with awkward-seeming and incomplete work in numerous
13 places. See Mia Jankowicz, Biden's order to pause construction on Trump's border wall
14 expires on March 20. Nobody knows what happens next., Business Insider (Mar. 16,
15 2021, 6:47 AM), https://www.businessinsider.com/what-happen-end-biden-60-day-
16 pause-border-wall-work-2021-3.
17 46. One major purpose of the Defendants' actions was to signal the relative
18 openness of the United States-Mexico border and to encourage migration.
19 47. Accordingly, DHS, following the policy prescriptions in the President's
20 proclamation, have finally decided that the United States-Mexico border is adequately
21 secured without the wall.
22 48. Furthermore, contrary to the unsupported claims that the wall was "not a
23 serious policy solution" in the proclamation, many individuals are constantly seeking to
24 cross the United States-Mexico border, for whom the wall has served both as a
25 meaningful physical barrier and a powerful signal of the federal government's
26 commitment to enforcing immigration law. And while DHS has reportedly

10

Case 2:21-cv-00617-DWL Document 7 Filed 04/12/21 Page 12 of 19

F "consider[ed]" making changes to address gaps in particular areas or implementing
2 technology in places where the wall is finished, DHS has no intent to deviate from the
3 fundamental policy announced in the Presidential Proclamation. See Ryan Saavedra,
4 Biden Admin Considers Restarting Border Wall Construction To 'Plug Gaps' Amid
5 Biden's Border Crisis: Report, Daily Wire (Apr. 6, 2021),

6 https://www.dailywire.com/news/biden-admin-considers-restarting-border-wall-
7 construction-to-plug-gaps-amid-bidens-border-crisis-report.
8 49. As a directand foreseeable consequence of the gaps in the nation's border

9 wall and the signal intentionally transmitted by the President and the Defendants,
10 migrants have been crossing the border in Arizona in greater numbers than ever before.
11 CBP reported it "encountered 171,700 migrants in March, including a record number of
12 unaccompanied minors, far exceeding the prior month's totals." See Priscilla Alvarez,
13 Border apprehensions spiked in March, including a record number of unaccompanied
14 migrant minors, https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/02/politics/us-mexico-border-
15 immigration-apprehended/index.html (last visited Apr. 11, 2021). Indeed, "[t]he US is
16 on track to encounter more than 2 million migrants at the US-Mexico border by the end
17 of the fiscal year, according to internal government estimates[,] marking a record high."
18 See Priscilla Alvarez, US on track to encounter record 2 million migrants on the
19 southern border, government estimates show,
20 https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/31/politics/migrants-us-southern-border/index.html(last
21 visited Apr. 11, 2021).
22 50. One border county sheriff stated that, at a particular gap in the fencing,
23 "five or six groups" of migrants are able to cross a day. See Roman Chiarello, Arizona
24 sheriff says Biden halting border wall construction left area wide open for cartels, Fox
25 News (Mar. 5, 2021), https://www.foxnews.com/us/arizona-sheriff-biden-border-wall-
26 construction-cartels. One news outlet reported that "[s]mugglers send groups of asylum

11

Case 2:21-cv-00617-DWL Document 7 Filed 04/12/21 Page 13 of 19

F seekers through the gaps [in the fencing] to overwhelm the agents. When agents leave to
2 intercept or apprehend one group, another group scampers across." See William La
3 Jeunesse, Migrants stream through gaps in border wall following Biden's order to halt
4 construction, Fox News (Mar. 31, 2021), https://www.foxnews.com/politics/migrants-
5 stream-through-gaps-in-border-wall-following-bidens-order-to-halt-construction.
6 51. One source estimates that approximately 1,000 individuals are able to
7 evade detention and enter the United States illegally every single day, many of which are
8 able to do SO because of these glaring holes in the nation's border. See Heritage Experts
9 Release New Biden Border Crisis Fact Check, Heritage Foundation (March 25, 2021),
10 https://www.heritage.org/press/heritage-experts-release-new-biden-border-crisis-fact-
11 check. Inevitably, many of these migrants settle in Arizona, increasing the population of
12 the state.

13 52. Despite these reasonably foreseeable effects of Defendants' policies, at no
14 time did they undertake any analysis of the environmental impacts on the human
15 environment in Arizona of leaving the wall unfinished. These effects required
16 preparation of an EIS before Defendants undertook the challenged actions. Defendants
17 violated NEPA by failing to do so.
18 53. The combined effect of (1) partially constructing a barrier (2) followed by
19 intentional refusal to complete portions of the barrier, leaving enormous "gaps," also has
20 significant environmental impacts by itself. In particular, the barrier-with its new
21 gaps-fragments the habitat of wildlife that lives in the U.S.-Mexico border region. And
22 it does so in a manner that is completely arbitrary, unplanned, and unstudied under
23 NEPA.

24 54. Defendants are required to perform an EIS to study the effects on wildlife
25 and the environment as a result of the gaps they have now intentionally created in the
26 border barrier.

B. Ending the "Remain in Mexico" Policy
2 55.
W In January, 2019, DHS enacted the "Migrant Protection Protocols," (the

4 "MPP") commonly known as the "Remain in Mexico" policy. Under this policy,

5 "certain foreign individuals entering or seeking admission to the U.S. from Mexico

6 illegally or without proper documentation" were "returned to Mexico [to] wait outside of

7 the U.S. for the duration of their immigration proceedings[.]" See Migrant Protection
Protocols, Department of Homeland

8 Security (Jan. 24, 2019),

9 https://www.dhs.gov/news/2019/01/24/migrant-protection-protocols.
56.

10 Under this program, approximately 65,000 non-Mexican migrants who

11 were detained attempting to enter the United States illegally or without proper

2 things, ordered DHS and HHS to "reinstate the safe and orderly reception and processing

3 of arriving asylum seekers, consistent with public health and safety and capacity

4 constraints" and commanded DHS to "promptly review and determine whether to

5 terminate or modify the program known as the Migrant Protection Protocols[.]" Id.

58.

6 On February 11, 2021, DHS announced it would process into the United

7 States individuals who had been returned to Mexico under the MPP. See DHS Announces

8 Process to Address Individuals in Mexico with Active MPP Cases, Department of

United States.

12 59.

13 On information and belief, thousands of individuals have been released
and are being released into Arizona as
14 a result of the termination of this program that

15 otherwise would never have entered the country. Many, if not most, will be able to

16 remain and reside in the state, regardless of the formal outcomes of their immigration

17 proceedings. Despite the intent to cause this outcome, at no time did Defendants

18 undertake any analysis of the environmental impacts on the human environment in
Arizona of this additional population.
19 C.
20 Impact of Increased Population on the Human Environment

60.

21 On information and belief, thousands of additional individuals have settled

22 and continue to settle in Arizona than otherwise would have as the intentional,

23 anticipated, and direct result of Defendants actions.

61.

24 As stated above, NEPA expressly states that one of its purposes is to

25 "achieve a balance between population and resource use which will permit high

26 standards of living and a wide sharing of life's amenities[.]" 42 U.S.C. § 4331(b). As the
drafters of NEPA recognized, population growth has significant environmental impacts.

14

Case 2:21-cv-00617-DWL Document 7 Filed 04/12/21 Page 16 of 19

F Migrants (like everyone else) need housing, infrastructure, hospitals, and schools. They
2 drive cars, purchase goods, and use public parks and other facilities. Their actions also
3 directly result in the release of pollutants, carbon dioxide, and other greenhouse gases

4 into the atmosphere, which directly affects air quality. All of these activities have
5 significant environment impact which, as discussed above, courts have recognized as
6 cognizable impacts under NEPA.
7 62. Accordingly, numerous decisions have considered the impact of agency
8 actions on growth and the extent to which impacts from that growth could come within
9 the ambit of NEPA. Since at least 1975, the Ninth Circuit has recognized that population
10 growth is an environmental impact that agencies must often consider under NEPA. See
11 City of Davis, 521 F.2d at 671 (concluding that "an influx of population that will frustrate
12 the city's policy of 'controlled growth' and render its planning efforts to date obsolete"
13 was an "environmental consequence[]" sufficient to grant plaintiff standing under
14 NEPA). See also Barnes, 655 F.3d at 1139 (holding that, with respect to project adding a
15 new runway to an airport, "even if the stated purpose of the project is to increase safety
16 and efficiency, the agencies must analyze the impacts of the increased demand
17 attributable to the additional runway as growth-inducing effects"); City of Carmel-By-
18 The-Sea v. U.S. Dep't of Transp., 123 F.3d 1142, 1162 (9th Cir. 1997) ("Consideration of
19 the growth-inducing effects furthers the National Environmental Policy Act's information
20 and public awareness goals.").
21 63. Population and growth effects must be considered as long as such effects
22 are "reasonably foreseeable[.]" Center for Biological Diversity, 982 F.3d at 737. This
23 includes indirect effects and such effects as may be ""later in time'" or "farther removed
24 in distance'" from the agency action in question. Id. For example, "[a]n increased risk of
25 an oil spill caused by an increase in crude oil tanker traffic is a reasonably foreseeable

indirect effect of a proposed dock extension." Id. (citing Ocean Advocates v. U.S. Army
2 Corps. of Eng'rs, 402 F.3d 846, 867-70 (9th Cir. 2005)).
c 64. Where there is a question as to whether a major federal action will affect
4 the environment, "[t]he appropriate inquiry" is whether the effect at issue is so "remote
5 and highly speculative that NEPA does not warrant its consideration. See San Luis
6 Obispo Mothers for Peace v. Nuclear Regulatory Comm'n, 449 F.3d 1016, 1030 (9th Cir.
7 2006) (finding that Nuclear Regulatory Commission had violated NEPA by failing to
8 consider the possibility of terrorist attacks on Diablo Canyon nuclear facility).
9 65. Furthermore, "NEPA requires that an environmental analysis for a single
10 project consider the cumulative impacts of that project together with all past, present and
11 reasonably foreseeable future actions." See Idaho Sporting Cong., Inc. V. Rittenhouse,
12 305 F.3d 957, 973 (9th Cir. 2002). See also Great Basin Res. Watch v. Bureau of Land
13 Mgmt., 844 F.3d 1095, 1104 (9th Cir. 2016) ("In a cumulative impact analysis, an agency
14 must take a 'hard look' at all actions that may combine with the action under
15 consideration to affect the environment.") (quoting Te-Moak Tribe of W. Shoshone of
16 Nev. v. U.S. Dep't of Interior, 608 F.3d 592, 603 (9th Cir. 2010)) (cleaned up).
17 66. Here, all of the impacts from the actions detailed above should have been
18 considered together, along with other parts of the administration's policy which serve to
19 encourage migration. Whether considered separately or collectively, the impact of those
20 policies, there can be little doubt, will foreseeably and directly impact the population of
21 border states like Arizona.

22 67. Notwithstanding this governing law, in formulating the policies discussed
23 above, the Defendants never took any of the specific procedures required by NEPA and
the CEQ regulations. Defendants at no time have ever accounted for any environmental 24

25 impacts of those policies or the cumulative impact of those actions in combination with
26 each other.

INTRODUCTION

1. This action challenges the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' ("Corps") unlawful

issuance of a federal Clean Water Act ("CWA") permit authorizing the filling of approximately

180 acres of ecologically-valuable wetlands for the construction of the Cainhoy Plantation

("Cainhoy" or "the Cainhoy development"), a mixed-use residential and commercial

development that will be built off already overcrowded Clements Ferry Road and nearby

Highway 41 in Berkeley County. As proposed, the Cainhoy Plantation will locate 45% of its

planned housing acreage in the floodplain at a time when the City of Charleston is coping with

2:22-cv-02727-RMG Date Filed 08/17/22 Entry Number 1 Page 2 of 41

the growing problem of sea level rise and flooding, and when the Corps is planning to build a

large seawall around the Charleston peninsula to protect against these threats.

2. The Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), as the agency ultimately
responsible for implementation of section 404 of the CWA, is responsible for its failure to veto

the Corps permit.

3. The Corps' and EPA's CWA section 404 Permit ("Permit") allowing for the filling

of a massive amount of wetlands was issued in violation of the CWA's requirement that any such
wetland fills must be the "least environmentally damaging practicable alternative." Here, there
were multiple less damaging practicable alternatives presented to the Corps that would have
allowed for the Cainhoy Plantation to proceed, but with far less harm to wetlands. These
alternatives would have fulfilled the project purpose by creating the same number of housing
units while avoiding entirely or dramatically lessening wetlands impacts. In its own decision

documents, the Corps deemed these alternatives "feasible." Yet, in violation of the CWA, the

Corps approved the Cainhoy Plantation's plan to destroy more than 180 acres of wetlands

because it was the developer's preferred method of developing the site.

4. The Corps also failed to comply with the mandates of the National Environmental

Policy Act ("NEPA") in approving this major and highly controversial Cainhoy development,

which has significant environmental impacts, including impacts to wetlands, special historic

sites, and species listed under the Endangered Species Act ("ESA"), without requiring the

preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement ("EIS").

5. For its part, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service ("the Service") unlawfully

issued a Biological Opinion authorizing the extirpation of endangered red-cockaded

woodpeckers ("RCWs") from the property. The Biological Opinion arbitrarily defined the action

2

2:22-cv-02727-RMG Date Filed 08/17/22 Entry Number 1 Page 3 of 41

area to exclude the adjacent Francis Marion National Forest ("FMNF"), and its conclusions
about impacts to RCWs (including its failure to establish an adequate trigger for the reinitiation

of consultation should impacts to RCWs be greater than planned) are irrational.

6. Plaintiffs South Carolina Coastal Conservation League, Charleston Waterkeeper,

and South Carolina Wildlife Federation (collectively, "Conservation Groups") seek a declaration

that the Corps' and EPA's decisions to approve the Permit were arbitrary, capricious, and in

violation of the CWA; that the Corps' Environmental Assessment ("EA") is arbitrary and
capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act ("APA") and NEPA; the Corps'

decision to prepare only an EA for the Cainhoy Plantation was unlawful, arbitrary, and

capricious in violation of the APA and NEPA; and that the Service's Biological Opinion is

arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA. Conservation Groups ask this Court to (1)

vacate the Corps' and EPA's Permit, EA, and Decision Document (2) vacate the Service's

Biological Opinion and Incidental Take Statement, and (3) enjoin Defendants from taking any

actions to dredge or fill wetlands under the Permit until Defendants comply with the

requirements of the CWA, NEPA, the ESA, and the APA.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

7. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant § to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question),

28 U.S.C. § 1361 (federal officer action), 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 (declaratory judgment),

33 U.S.C. §§ 1361 et seq. (CWA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321 et seq. (NEPA), and 5 U.S.C. §§ 551 et

seq. (APA).

8. The violations of law alleged have largely occurred within the District of South

Carolina. Venue for this action is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391 and Local
Civil Rule 3.01(A)(1). Venue is appropriate in the Charleston division because the Cainhoy

3

2:22-cv-02727-RMG Date Filed 08/17/22 Entry Number 1 Page 4 of 41

Plantation is located in the City of Charleston, and because a substantial part of the events and

omissions giving rise to the claim occurred at the Corps and Service offices in Charleston. The

Charleston District of the Corps and Commander Johannes reside in the Charleston Division and

have conducted significant business relating to the Cainhoy development in this Division. The

other Federal Defendants are located in Atlanta, GA and Washington, D.C., not other divisions

of this District. The Conservation Groups and their counsel are based in the Charleston Division.

PARTIES

A. Plaintiffs

9. Plaintiff South Carolina Coastal Conservation League is a not-for-profit

corporation founded in 1989. The Conservation League is incorporated under the laws of South

Carolina, maintains its headquarters in Charleston, South Carolina, and currently has

approximately 1,800 members. Its mission is to protect the natural environment of South

Carolina, including wetland, aquatic, and terrestrial habitats and ecologies, and to enhance the

quality of life of South Carolina communities by working with individuals, businesses, and
government to ensure balanced solutions to environmental problems. The Conservation League
seeks to preserve the quality of the natural environment while protecting human health and
community livability from mutual threats such as air and water pollution and the fragmentation

of human and ecological communities.

10. Plaintiff Charleston Waterkeeper is a not-for-profit corporation founded in 2008.

The Waterkeeper is incorporated under the laws of South Carolina, maintains its headquarters in

Mt. Pleasant, South Carolina, and currently has approximately 500 members. The Waterkeeper

works to defend and restore local waterways through advocacy, education, and enforcement of

4

2:22-cv-02727-RMG Date Filed 08/17/22 Entry Number 1 Page 5 of 41

environmental laws. The Waterkeeper is an affiliate of the Waterkeeper Alliance, a global

movement of on-the-water advocates who patrol and protect rivers and coasts all over the world.

11. Plaintiff South Carolina Wildlife Federation is a not-for-profit corporation

officially organized in 1946, with operations dating back to 1931. The Wildlife Federation is

incorporated under the laws of South Carolina, maintains its headquarters in Columbia, South
Carolina, and currently has approximately 2,000 members. The Wildlife Federation works to
promote sound stewardship of South Carolina's natural resources. The Wildlife Federation's
conservation and education programs focus on protecting habitat for wildlife across South

Carolina, from the mountains to the sea. The Wildlife Federation is an affiliate of the National

Wildlife Federation, the United States' largest private, nonprofit conservation education and

advocacy organization.

12. Conservation Groups represent the interests of members who live, work, and

recreate in the immediate and general vicinity of the proposed Cainhoy development, and have

an ongoing interest in protecting wetlands and water quality, and conserving wildlife and wildlife

habitat in the areas that would be impacted by the Cainhoy Plantation.

13. For example, Conservation Groups represent the interests of members, such as

Gates Roll, a member of both the South Carolina Coastal Conservation League and South

Carolina Wildlife Federation, who use the waters surrounding Cainhoy professionally as fishing

guides and recreationally as fishing enthusiasts. Conservation Groups represent the interests of
members, such as Mark Joye, a member of the Charleston Waterkeeper, who have grown up

using the waters and marshes of the ando River for recreational boating, fishing, and the

general enjoyment of these wild environments. Conservation Groups also represent the interests

5

2:22-cv-02727-RMG Date Filed 08/17/22 Entry Number 1 Page 6 of 41

of members, such as Dana Beach, a member of the South Carolina Coastal Conservation League,

who enjoy birdwatching and generally recreating in the adjacent Francis Marion National Forest.

14. Conservation Groups and their members have been and continue to be injured by

the Corps' and EPA's decisions to authorize discharges to the waters of the United States for the

Cainhoy development, including filling and clearing of waters used by Conservation Groups'

members, and wetlands and streams connected to waters used by Conservation Groups'

members. Had the Corps and EPA permitted and approved one of the less damaging practicable

alternatives presented to the Corps during the comment period, these members' harms would

have been alleviated.

15. Conservation Groups and their members are also harmed by the Service's

decision authorizing the take of all RCWs on Cainhoy and destruction of RCW habitat adjacent

to the FMNF because they enjoy birding trips in and around the national forest to view rare

animal and plant species, including RCWs. Conservatione Groups are also harmed by the lack of

an adequate effects analysis and trigger for the reinitiation of ESA consultation on RCW

impacts, as there is no meaningful way to ensure that the impact of the project on RCWs, which

these members observe and enjoy, will not be greater than anticipated (or that consultation will
be reinitiated if this does occur).

16. Additionally, Conservation Groups and their members have been and continue to

be injured by the Corps' decision not to prepare an EIS as required by NEPA. This procedural

failure has prevented them from fully participating in an open and public discussion of the
Cainhoy development pursuant to NEPA.

17. As set forth above, Conservation Groups and their members have recreational,

aesthetic, property, and other concrete interests that will be adversely affected and irreparably

6

2:22-cv-02727-RMG Date Filed 08/17/22 Entry Number 1 Page 7 of 41

harmed by the development of Cainhoy, due to the Corps,' EPA's, and the Service's arbitrary

and capricious decision-making.

18. Conservation Groups and their members will be imminently and irreparably

injured unless there is an order from this Court vacating the Corps' and EPA's approval of the

Permit, the Corps' EA and Decision Document, and the Service's Biological Opinion and

Incidental Take Statement before the development of Cainhoy is undertaken.

19. Because the challenged decisions in this case are the cause of Conservation
Groups' and their members' injuries, an order from this Court vacating these decisions and
requiring compliance with the law would redress Conservation Groups' and their members'

injuries.

B. Defendants

LEGAL BACKGROUND

A. Clean Water Act

28. In 1972, Congress passed the CWA to "restore and maintain the chemical,

physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters." 33 U.S.C. § 1251(a). To achieve this

objective, section 301 of the CWA prohibits "the discharge of any pollutant" into "the navigable

waters of the United States" except in accordance with permits issued under the CWA. Id.

§1311(a). "Navigable waters" are defined as "the waters of the United States, including the

8

2:22-cv-02727-RMG Date Filed 08/17/22 Entry Number 1 Page 9 of 41

territorial sea." Id. § 1362(7). "Pollutants" include dredged spoil, rock, dirt, and sand, among

other materials. See id. §1362(6).

29. Section 404 of the CWA authorizes the Secretary of the Army to issue permits for
the discharge of dredged or fill material into "the waters of the United States" when certain

conditions are met. 33 U.S.C. § 1344. The section 404 permitting program is administered by

the Corps, with ultimate authority for the program residing with the EPA. The term "waters of

the United States" includes wetlands and streams that are tributaries to traditional navigable

waters. 33 C.F.R. § 328.3(a) (Corps); 40 C.F.R. § 232.2 (EPA).

30. Unless exempted by section 404(f)(1), which is not applicable here, all discharges

of fill material into waters of the United States, including wetlands, must be authorized under a

section 404 permit issued by the Corps.

31. Issuance of all section 404 permits is subject to the section 404(b)(1) Guidelines

found at 40 C.F.R. Part 230. The Guidelines provide particular protection for wetlands, which
are defined as "special aquatic sites,' id. § 230.41, "the degradation or destruction of [which] .. .

is considered to be among the most severe environmental impacts covered by [the] Guidelines."

Id. § 230.1.

32. The section 404(b)(1) Guidelines provide, inter alia, that no discharge of fill

material may be permitted if there is a less damaging "practicable alternative" available, or if the
discharge will "cause or contribute to significant degradation" of waters of the United States. 40

C.F.R. § 230.10. Factors to determine whether significant degradation will occur include the

"[s]ignificantly adverse effects of the discharge of pollutants on human health or welfare,

including but not limited to effects on... special aquatic sites" Id. § 230(10)(c)(1), and the

9

2:22-cv-02727-RMG Date Filed 08/17/22 Entry Number 1 Page 10 of 41

"[s]ignificantly adverse effects of discharge of pollutants on recreational, aesthetic, and

economic values." 40 C.F.R. § 230(10)(c)(4).

33. The section 404(b)(1) Guidelines require that the Corps follow a specific two step

procedure in applying the practicable alternative standard. First, a correct statement of the

project's "basic purpose" is necessary. See id. § 230.10(a)(3). The Corps defines a project's basic

purpose. See 33 C.F.R. Part 325, App. B(9)(b)(4). Second, after the Corps defines the basic

purpose of the project, it must determine whether that basic purpose is "water dependent." See 40

C.F.R. § 230.10(a)(3). An activity is "water dependent" if it requires access or proximity within a

wetland to fulfill its basic purpose. Id.

34. If the activity is not "water dependent," as is the case here, the Guidelines require

that the Corps apply a presumption that a practicable alternative with less adverse environmental

impact on the wetland is available. Id. When this presumption applies, the applicant must then

rebut the presumption by "clearly demonstrat[ing]" that a practicable alternative is not available,

id., and bears the burden of providing "detailed, clear and convincing information proving that

an alternative with less adverse impact is impracticable." Greater Yellowstone Coal. v. Flowers,

359 F.3d 1257, 1269 (10th Cir. 2004) (internal quotations and citation omitted).

35. In conducting this analysis, the Corps may rely on information submitted by the
applicant but must independently verify such information. Id.; 40 C.F.R. § 1506.5(a).

36. Under the section 404(b)(1) Guidelines, the Corps must not only independently

assess the overall project purpose, but also conduct its own "independent evaluation" of

practicable alternatives to meet the purpose. Fund for Animals, Inc. v. Rice, 85 F.3d 535, 543

(11th Cir. 1996). The section 404(b)(1) Guidelines require the Corps to deny a permit unless the

applicant can show that there are no practicable alternatives with less adverse impact on the

10

2:22-cv-02727-RMG Date Filed 08/17/22 Entry Number 1 Page 11 of 41

aquatic ecosystem after consideration of a variety of factors, including: stream impacts

(quantitative and qualitative), qualitative wetland function, impacts to other waters (quantitative

and qualitative), impacts to threatened and endangered species, and cultural resources. See 40

C.F.R. Part 230.

37. In addition to consideration of practicable alternatives, the 404(b)(1) Guidelines

require a permittee to take "all appropriate and practicable steps to avoid and minimize adverse

impacts to waters of the United States." 40 C.F.R. §§ 230.91(c)(2), 230.70-.77. Only after such

steps are taken is compensatory mitigation permitted "to offset environmental losses resulting

from unavoidable impacts to waters of the United States." 40 CFR § 230.93(a)(1).

38. The Corps is required to conduct a public interest review of the permit application

to balance "the benefits which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal" against

any "reasonably foreseeable detriment." 33 C.F.R. § 320.4(a)(1).

39. Regulations for the public interest review require the consideration of all factors

that are relevant to the proposal, and the cumulative effect thereof, including: "conservation,

economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and

wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, ... conservation, water quality, . ..

and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people." 33 C.F.R. § 320.4.

40. Pursuant to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit's decision in National

Wildlife Federation v. Hanson, "both the Corps and the EPA are responsible for the issuance of

permits under the CWA and enforcement of their terms. . . . The EPA is ultimately responsible

for the protection of wetlands." 859 F.2d 313, 315-16 (4th Cir. 1988). In the Fourth Circuit,

citizens may sue the EPA Administrator and the Corps "when the Corps abdicates its
responsibility." Id. at 316.

B. National Environmental Policy Act

41. NEPA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321 et seq., is "our basic national charter for protection of
the environment." 40 C.F.R. § 1500.1 (1978). NEPA requires federal agencies to take a hard
look at the environmental consequences of an agency action before proceeding with that action.
See 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321, 4332(2)(C); 40 C.F.R. §§ 1501.2 (1978), 1502.5 (1978).

42. Under applicable Council of Environmental Quality ("CEQ") regulations,'

"[m]ajor Federal action" requiring NEPA review is defined to "includ[e] actions with effects that
may be major and which are potentially subject to Federal control and responsibility." 40 C.F.R.

§ 1508.18 (1978). "Actions include new and continuing activities, including projects and

programs entirely or partly .. . regulated[] or approved by federal agencies." Id.

43. The Corps' and EPA's issuance of the Permit for the Cainhoy Plantation is a

major Federal action subject to NEPA review.

44. For "major Federal actions" significantly affecting the quality of the human

environment, NEPA requires that federal agencies prepare an EIS. See 42 § U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C).

Where it is not readily discernible whether the environmental effects of a proposed action will be

significant, federal agencies may first prepare a less-rigorous EA to establish the project's level
of impact. See 40 C.F.R. §§ 1501.4(b) (1978), 1508.9(a)(1) (1978); 33 C.F.R. §§ 230.10-.11. If
the impacts assessed in an EA are likely to be significant, then the federal agency must prepare a

full EIS.

Though amended by the recent "Update to the Regulations Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA," 85 Fed. Reg. 43304 (July 16, 2020), the NEPA regulations cited within
this complaint continue to guide review of the Cainhoy development permitting, which had been
underway for years before the new regulations. Courts across the nation continue to apply this version of the NEPA regulations, and the Corps relied on these regulations in this case.

12

2:22-cv-02727-RMG Date Filed 08/17/22 Entry Number 1 Page 13 of 41

45. "Significan[ce]" depends on a number of factors, including impacts that may be

beneficial or adverse, proximity to wetlands and rivers, presence of unique or uncertain risks,

and the possibility for adverse effects on an endangered or threatened species. 40 C.F.R.

§ 1508.27 (1978). The presence of any one of these factors is sufficient to require an EIS.

46. An agency's NEPA analysis must include a "full and fair discussion" of all direct

and indirect environmental impacts, 40 C.F.R. §§ 1502.1 (1978), 1508.8 (1978), and consider the

cumulative effects of past, present, and reasonably foreseeable activities in combination with the

proposed action. Id. § 1508.7 (1978).

47. Direct effects are "caused by the action and occur at the same time and place,"

whereas indirect effects are "caused by the action and are later in time or farther removed in

distance, but are still reasonably foreseeable." Id. § 1508.8 (1978).

48. Cumulative effects are "the impact on the environment which result[] from the

incremental impact of the action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable

future actions." Id. § 1508.7 (1978). §

49. An agency's NEPA analysis must also analyze reasonable alternatives that would

avoid or minimize the action's adverse impacts, id. § 1502.1 (1978), and set § out measures to

mitigate those adverse effects, id. § 1502.14(f) (1978).

50. The agency's alternatives analysis must "present the environmental impacts of the

proposal and the alternatives in comparative form, thus sharply defining the issues and providing

a clear basis for choice among options by the decisionmaker and the public." Id. § 1502.14

(1978).

C. Endangered Species Act

51. "In response to growing concern over the extinction of many animal and plant

species, Congress enacted the Endangered Species Act of 1973." Gibbs v. Babbitt, 214 F.3d 483,

487 (4th Cir. 2000) (citation omitted). Congress' response was "powerful and substantially

unequivocal." Loggerhead Turtle v. Cty. Council of Volusia Cty., 148 F.3d 1231, 1246 (11th Cir.

1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1081 (1999) (citation and quotations omitted). Indeed, the ESA is

"the most comprehensive legislation for the preservation of endangered species ever enacted by

any nation." Tenn. Valley Auth. v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153, 180 (1978).

52. "The plain intent of Congress in enacting this statute . . was to halt and reverse

the trend toward species extinction, whatever the cost. This is reflected not only in the stated

policies of the Act, but in literally every section of the statute." Babbitt v. Sweet Home Chapter

of Cmtys. for a Great Ore., 515 U.S. 687, 699 (1995) (quoting Hill, 437 U.S. at 184).

"[E]xamination of the language, history, and structure of the legislation .. . indicates beyond

doubt that Congress intended endangered species to be afforded the highest of priorities." Hill,

437 U.S. at 174.

53. Recognizing these species' "esthetic, ecological, educational, historical,

recreational, and scientific value to the Nation and its people," 16 U.S.C. § 1531(a)(3), the ESA

set out "to provide a means whereby the ecosystems upon which endangered species and

threatened species depend may be conserved, [and] to provide a program for the conservation of

such endangered species and threatened species," id. § 1531(b). The purpose of the statute is to

recover these species to a healthy status. See id. § 1532(3) ("conservation" and "conserve" mean §

"to use and the use of all methods and procedures which are necessary to bring any endangered

14

2:22-cv-02727-RMG Date Filed 08/17/22 Entry Number 1 Page 15 of 41

species or threatened species to the point at which the measures provided pursuant to [the ESA]

are no longer necessary").

54. Principal responsibility for implementing the requirements of the ESA have been

delegated to the Service, an agency within the Department of the Interior, and to the National

Marine Fisheries Service ("NMFS"), an agency within the Department of Commerce.

55. Section 7(a)(2) is a critical component of the ESA's statutory and regulatory

scheme to conserve endangered and threatened species. It requires federal agencies to "insure"

that the actions that they fund, authorize, or undertake "[are] not likely to jeopardize the

continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction

or adverse modification" of their designated "critical habitat." 16 U.S.C. § 1536(a)(2); see 50

C.F.R. Part 400. In order to fulfill this substantive mandate, section 7(a)(2) and its implementing
regulations require that federal agencies engage in "consultation" with either NMFS or the
Service, depending on what species might be affected by the action. 16 U.S.C. § 1536(a)(2). The

agency's determination as to whether the federal action is likely to jeopardize a listed species,or

destroy or adversely modify its designated habitat is set forth in a biological opinion. See 16

U.S.C. § 1536(b)(3)(A); 50 C.F.R. § 402.14(h).

56. In formulating a biological opinion, "environmental context is critical. If the Fish

and Wildlife Service conducted its jeopardy analysis in a vacuum,' focusing only on the

individual agency action at issue, then 'a listed species could be gradually destroyed, so long as

each step on the path to destruction [wa]s sufficiently modest.™ Appalachian Voices v. U.S.

Dep't of the Interior, 25 F.4th 259, 269 (4th Cir. 2022) (quoting Nat'l Wildlife Fed'n v. Nat'l

Marine Fisheries Serv., 524 F.3d 917, 929-30 (9th Cir. 2008) (citations omitted).

15

2:22-cv-02727-RMG Date Filed 08/17/22 Entry Number 1 Page 16 of 41

57. Accordingly, "[the Service] must '[e]valuate' four different categories of

information: (1) the 'current status' of the listed species; (2) the 'environmental baseline'; (3) the

'cumulative effects' of non-federal actions; and (4) the [indirect and direct] *effects of the
[agency] action.™ Id. (quoting 50 C.F.R. § 402.14(g)(2), (3)). "Climate change typically must

form part of the analysis," as well. Id. at 271; see S. Yuba River Citizens League v. Nat'l Marine

Fisheries Serv., 723 F. Supp. 2d 1247, 1274 (E.D. Cal. 2010) (listing cases "[holding] that failure

to discuss the impacts of climate change rendered [biological opinions] arbitrary and

capricious"). The project's indirect and direct effects in turn determine the "action area." 50

§ C.F.R. § 402.02.

58. The Service must then "[a]dd the effects of the action and cumulative effects to

the environmental baseline and[,] in light of the status of the species and critical habitat,

formulate [its] opinion as to whether the action is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of

[the] listed species." Appalachian Voices, 25 F.4th at 271. "In effect, [the Service] must make its

jeopardy determination while viewing the action 'against the aggregate effects of everything that

has led to the species' current status and, for non-Federal activities, those things [likely] to affect
the species in the future." Id. (quoting U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service and National Marine

Fisheries Service, Endangered Species Consultation Handbook at 4-35 (March 1998)).

59. If the Service concludes that the proposed action is not likely to result in jeopardy

to a species, it must provide the action agency with an "incidental take statement." 16 U.S.C.
§ 1536(b)(4), (o); 50 C.F.R. § 402.14(i).

60. The ESA requires that the action agency report back to the Service on an action's

progress and its impacts on listed species, as specified in the incidental take statement, in order to

16

2:22-cv-02727-RMG Date Filed 08/17/22 Entry Number 1 Page 17 of 41

monitor the impacts of project. See 50 C.F.R. § 402.14(i)(3). Consultation must be immediately
reinitiated if the amount or extent of incidental taking is exceeded. Id. §§ 402.14(i)(4), 402.16(a).

61. To ensure an incidental take statement functions properly, "[the Service] must set
'a clear standard for determining when the level of anticipated take has been exceeded.** Sierra

Club v. U.S. Dep't of the Interior, 899 F.3d 260, 272 (4th Cir. 2018) (quoting 50 C.F.R. §

402.14(i)(1)(i)). "The requirement to include a trigger for reinitiation of consultation necessitates

more than lip service [and] [t]he lack of a clear trigger point to reinitiate consultation renders [a
biological opinion] unlawful." Am. Rivers v. FERC, 895 F.3d 32, 48 49 (D.C. Cir. 2018).

D. Administrative Procedure Act

62. The APA provides for judicial review of the actions and decisions of federal

agencies. "A person suffering legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or

aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute, is entitled to judicial review

thereof." 5 U.S.C. § 702.

63. "An agency rule [is] arbitrary and capricious if the agency has relied on factors

which Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of

the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the

agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of

agency expertise." Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n of U.S., Inc. V. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463

U.S. 29, 43 (1983).

64. Under section 706(1) of the APA, the reviewing court shall "compel agency
action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed." 5 U.S.C. § 706(1). Under section 706(2) of

the APA, the reviewing court shall "hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and

17

Page 18 of 41 2:22-cv-02727-RMG Date Filed 08/17/22 Entry Number 1

conclusions found to be (A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in

accordance with law." Id. § 706(2).

65. As detailed by the Supreme Court in Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154 (1997),

claims challenging erroneous biological opinions or incidental take statements issued by the

Service are reviewable under the APA.

STATEMENT OF FACTS

A. Cainhoy Property and Development

66. The Cainhoy Plantation is a 9,076-acre property in the City of Charleston and

Berkeley County on the north and south sides of Clements Ferry Road.

18

2:22-cv-02727-RMG Date Filed 08/17/22 Entry Number 1 Page 19 of 41

67. Over half of the acreage of the Cainhoy property is wetlands, including the

approximately 180 acres of wetlands that will be destroyed for construction of the Cainhoy

development. Upon information and belief, this is one of the largest wetlands fills for a mixed-
use residential/commercial development permitted by the Charleston District of the Corps in

recent history.

68. The southern boundary of Cainhoy is the Wando River, which provides prime

habitat for a wide array a of wildlife, and is a productive fishery.

69. Cainhoy shares over a two-mile border with the ecologically invaluable FMNF,

which is home to a variety of endangered, threatened, or at-risk animal and plant species,

including the endangered RCWs, threatened northern long-eared bats, and frosted flatwood

salamander.

70. Cainhoy serves as a vital wildlife corridor between the FMNF and the Cooper

River.

71. 2,850 acres of Cainhoy are contiguous old-growth longleaf pine forest, an

especially important and at-risk habitat in the Southeast and important habitat for RCWs.

72. Construction of the Cainhoy Plantation would result in a large mixed-use

residential and commercial development that would include at least 9,000 housing units and an

estimated 45,000 occupants.

73. The Cainhoy Plantation places 45% of the development's housing acreage within

the 100-year floodplain.

74. Construction of the Cainhoy Plantation will degrade the 2,850 acres of contiguous

old-growth longleaf pine forest on the property and result in the "take" of all RCWs on the

property.

19

2:22-cv-02727-RMG Date Filed 08/17/22 Entry Number 1 Page 20 of 41

75. In addition to destroying 180 acres of pristine wetlands, placing a large amount of

housing in the floodplain, and taking endangered species, the Cainhoy development will

contribute to Charleston's continuing problems with flooding and sea level rise.

76. The Cainhoy Plantation is one of the most ecologically and historically important

undeveloped tracts left in coastal South Carolina. The southern portion of the property borders

the Wando River and large stretches of marsh. As sea levels continue to rise, if left intact, the

Cainhoy marshes would migrate upland on undeveloped land, preserving the invaluable benefits

and resources associated with the unique marsh habitat.

77. The City of Charleston has recently enacted a comprehensive City Plan that

highlights the avoidance of development in the floodplain. Specifically, the City Plan

recommends that city developments "[r]educe densities on low-lying areas vulnerable to

flooding, and eliminate development in future marsh migration areas." City of Charleston,

Charleston City Plan at 146 (adopted Oct. 12, 2021), https://www.charleston-

sc.gov/DocumentCenter/View/31227/Final-City-Plan-Adopted-October-12-2021.

78. Rather than provide an adequate buffer zone from sea level rise and the storm

surge that the Corps fears on the Charleston peninsula (and for which the Corps is proposing to

construct a $1.1 billion seawall), the Cainhoy Plantation places substantial development in close

proximity to the current water line. This development not only endangers the long-term viability

of the adjacent marshes as sea levels rise, but it also endangers the residents of the development

during flooding and storm surge events in the present day and into the future.

79. The Cainhoy Plantation would also destroy or impair sites eligible for the

National Register of Historic Places, such as the St. Thomas & St. Denis Church and the Phillips

Community.

20

2:22-cv-02727-RMG Date Filed 08/17/22 Entry Number 1 Page 21 of 41

80. The Cainhoy Plantation threatens the Jack Primus community, a traditional

African American settlement community that is still primarily inhabited by the descendants of

the formerly enslaved peoples who founded the community following their emancipation. The

Jack Primus community is historically and culturally significant for its intact land use and

settlement patterns.

B. The Section 404 Permit

Permit Application and Comment Period

81. The Applicants applied for the Permit from the Corps on March 7, 2018.

82. The Corps advertised the Cainhoy development for public comment on March 21,

2018.

83. Conservation Groups provided comments on the Permit on September 19, 2018.

See Exhibit 1.

84. With another letter on September 1, 2020, Conservation Groups provided the

Corps with an extensive report by Dover, Kohl & Partners ("Dover Kohl"), which analyzed

potential alternative plans that could offer equal development benefits with less environmental

harm. See Exhibit 2. These plans demonstrated that the applicants' proposal was not the least

environmentally damaging practicable alternative.

85. The Dover Kohl report included four alternative development scenarios for

Cainhoy. Dover Kohl's three alternatives with 9,000 housing units ranged from (1) over 4,000

lots with 13.2 acres of wetland impacts; (2) just under 4,000 lots with 11 acres of wetland

impacts; to (3) around 3,300 lots with 5.2 acres of wetland impacts. Dover Kohl's alternative

with 6,000 housing units had no wetland impacts at all and only 17% of development acreage in

the floodplain.

21

2:22-cv-02727-RMG Date Filed 08/17/22 Entry Number 1 Page 22 of 41

86. Conservation Groups provided more comments on October 21, 2020, urging the
Corps to prepare a full EIS on the Cainhoy Plantation and explaining the ESA harms that would

flow from the development. See Exhibit 3. Conservation Groups explained that "the proposed

Cainhoy development ticks every single box for a 'significant' action requiring an EIS." Id. at 2.

Conservation Groups further elaborated their concerns regarding flooding, marsh migration,

infrastructure, and endangered and threatened species, as well as their concerns that the Cainhoy

development would fail to comply with the requirements of the CWA. See id. at 3-8, 13-16.

87. Conservation Groups submitted a final comment letter on October 20, 2021, to

apprise the Corps of the City of Charleston's recently enacted City Plan that disfavors

development in the floodplain and highlights the importance of leaving open space for marsh

migration as sea levels rise. See Exhibit 4.

The Corps' Decision Document

88. The Corps signed its Decision Document approving the Cainhoy Plantation, the

Memorandum for the Record, and the Environmental Assessment on May 6, 2022.

89. The Corps defined the basic project purpose as "to construct a mixed use

development to include residential, commercial, educational, office and government facilities."

Decision Document at 14.

90. The Corps defined "[t]he overall project purpose [as] to construct a mixed use

development to include residential, commercial, educational, office and government facilities

with access to major traffic arteries that has the demographic support, zoning, infrastructure and

access to schools and hospitals to help meet the needs of the growing Charleston, South Carolina

metropolitan area." Id.

22

2:22-cv-02727-RMG Date Filed 08/17/22 Entry Number 1 Page 23 of 41

91. The Corps found that the activity "does not require access or proximity to or
a siting within a special aquatic site to fulfill its basic purpose. Therefore, the activity is not water

dependent." Id.

Alternatives Analysis

92. In the Decision Document, the Corps conducted an alternatives analysis

considering 9 off-site alternative sites around the Charleston area. See id. at 101.

93. The Corps explained that "[i]n order to be practicable, an alternative must be

available, achieve the overall project purpose (as defined by the Corps), and be feasible when

considering cost, logistics and existing technology." Id. at 100.

94. The "[c]riteria for evaluating alternatives as evaluated and determined by the

Corps" included a requirement that all sites contained a minimum of "7,500 [acres] with 5,000

acres developable uplands," among other required features such as proximity to an interstate or

highway and to downtown Charleston. Id. at 100-01 (emphasis added).

95. The Corps concluded that Cainhoy "me[t] the site selection/screening criteria for

size" because "[t]h[e] site totals 9,375 acres and has 5,585 acres of uplands . . . ." Id. at 107, 128.

96. However, the Corps' own wetland delineation of Cainhoy found a total of 4,546.2

acres of uplands, over 1,000 acres short of the number cited in the EA and almost 500 acres short

of the criterion the Corps "evaluated and determined" to be necessary for any alternative to be

suitable. Id. at 100.

97. The Corps thus permitted the Cainhoy development despite this alternative's

failure to meet the agency's own criteria for satisfying the project purpose.

23

2:22-cv-02727-RMG Date Filed 08/17/22 Entry Number 1 Page 24 of 41

The Least Environmentally Damaging Practicable Alternative

98. The Corps also permitted the Cainhoy development when this proposal was not
the least environmentally damaging practicable alternative.

99. The Corps found that "the Dover [Kohl] Plan could be a feasible development
design…" yet went on to reject this alternative as not "the intent of the applicants, nor what the

applicants have proposed…" Decision Document at 133 (emphasis in original).

100. The only criterion that the Dover Kohl plan fails to satisfy is the site size

criterion. But the selected Cainhoy development also fails to satisfy this criterion, as discussed

above in paragraphs 96-97.

101. Of the other criteria, the Dover Kohl plan satisfies each one: it is located within

50 miles of Charleston with a commuter time of 45 minutes or less, it is within a 10-mile radius

of an interstate or four lane major highway, it is attainable, it has access to utilities infrastructure,

and it is appropriately zoned for mixed-use development.

102. Further, the Dover Kohl plan satisfies the project purpose because it would

construct a mixed-use development to include residential, commercial, educational, office and
government facilities with access to major traffic arteries that has the demographic support,
zoning, infrastructure and access to schools and hospitals to help meet the needs of the growing

Charleston, South Carolina metropolitan area.

103. The Corps concluded that "because the Dover Plan is inconsistent with the

overall project purpose, it is not considered to be a practicable on-site alternative for the Cainhoy

Plantation property in light of overall project purpose.' Id. at 133-34.

104. The Corps did not cite any specific reason why the Dover Kohl plan was
inconsistent with the overall project purpose.

24

2:22-cv-02727-RMG Date Filed 08/17/22 Entry Number 1 Page 25 of 41

105. The Dover Kohl plan satisfies every aspect of the project purpose, but with far

fewer impacts to wetlands.

Significant Degradation

106. The Corps Permit allows for the significant degradation of wetlands in violation

of the CWA and Guidelines.

107. Human health and welfare are directly implicated by filling wetlands to place

thousands of homes within the floodplain. These homes will be unnecessarily susceptible to

flooding and storm surge; the Corps fully recognizes the dangers of storm surge in Charleston

and is currently proposing a storm surge wall to surround the low-lying Charleston peninsula.

Wetlands act as a buffer a from storms, and the destruction of wetlands only makes future

residents more vulnerable.

108. Included in the consideration of health and human welfare is the consideration of

effects on special aquatic sites. See 40 C.F.R. § 230.10(c)(1).

109. Wetlands are considered "special aquatic sites" under the Guidelines. Id. §

230.41.

110. The Corps' response to a Freedom of Information Act request spanning ten years
of Charleston District Corps permits reveals the significance of the impacts the Cainhoy
Plantation will have on these special aquatic sites. Over a ten-year span, the Corps issued 4,102

permits for development projects totaling 1,026 acres of wetland fill.

111. Cainhoy alone represents nearly 18% of the development impacts authorized

over ten years.

112. Beyond impacts to human health and welfare, the Cainhoy development would

also have significant adverse effects on the recreational, aesthetic, and economic values of the

Cainhoy peninsula.

25

2:22-cv-02727-RMG Date Filed 08/17/22 Entry Number 1 Page 26 of 41

113. The waters surrounding Cainhoy provide excellent opportunities to the public

for recreational fishing. The areas of the FMNF which are adjacent to the eastern edge of

Cainhoy are some of the most biologically diverse of the entire forest, thus providing prime areas

for exploration by naturalists. The introduction of what essentially amounts to a new city along

those waters and neighboring those areas of the forest would cause irreparable harm to those

recreational interests.

114. Lastly, the substantial amount of the Cainhoy development unnecessarily placed
in locations vulnerable to future sea level rise, flooding and storm surge, will have significant

adverse economic effects for future residents.

Avoidance and Minimization

115. During its permitting process, the Corps was presented with the comments of
multiple agencies explaining that the Cainhoy development did not adequately avoid and
minimize impacts to waters of the United States.

116. Both the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources ("SCDNR") and

NMFS advocated for additional avoidance and minimization efforts. See Decision Document at

84.

117. SCDNR's final comment letter on the Cainhoy Plantation stated that SCDNR

"continues to find that the best use for this property, based on the ecological functions and

unique resources located there, would be conservation." Id.

118. SCDNR's final letter also stated that SCDNR "continues to recommend that

additional efforts are made to further avoid and minimize project impacts before consideration

for compensatory mitigation." Id. No further wetland avoidance or minimization was achieved in
response to SCDNR's final letter.

26

2:22-cv-02727-RMG Date Filed 08/17/22 Entry Number 1 Page 27 of 41

119. Likewise, NMFS commented that it "fully concurs" with SCDNR's comments,

id. at 71, and NMFS commented on its own behalf that "[t]he[ ] cumulative impacts [of docks on

tidal creeks] must be assessed as part of the EFH assessment and real avoidance and

minimization strategies developed for the project." Id. at 85. Despite the certainty that future

residents will construct docks in tidal creeks, the Corps concluded that it did not have to evaluate

those impacts before issuing the Permit because "[t]he applicant has not included any proposed

docks in their DA application." Id. at 199.

120. Other expert agencies have asserted that further avoidance and minimization is
possible, and the Dover Kohl plan demonstrates that further avoidance and minimization of
wetlands impacts on the property is, in fact, possible.

Public Interest Review

121. In conducting its public interest review, the Corps concluded that "[t]he benefits

resulting from this proposal will assist in meeting the needs of the growing Charleston

metropolitan population and will outweigh the detriments of the proposal." Id. at 165.

122. To the contrary, the detriments of the Cainhoy Plantation far outweigh any

claimed benefits.

123. The majority of the public benefits claimed by the Corps are not benefits at all,

but rather mitigation measures intended to balance out the harms of the proposed development or

avoid further detriment.

124. The proposed Point Hope Nature Sanctuary and the preservation of on-site

wetlands, for example, were proposed by the Applicants to satisfy mitigation requirements

contained in the CWA. The land comprising the Point Hope Nature Sanctuary is already

27

2:22-cv-02727-RMG Date Filed 08/17/22 Entry Number 1 Page 28 of 41

undeveloped habitat, and its continued protection does not serve the national goal of no net loss

of wetlands.

125. The same can be said for the on-site wetlands slated for preservation. These

resources will ultimately be degraded despite their "preservation" as part of the Cainhoy

development. The proliferation of roads, homes, and other infrastructure around the Point Hope

Nature Sanctuary and on-site wetlands will result in pollution, fragmentation and isolation, and

other adverse effects, degrading these landscapes and their ecosystem services over time.

126. The Dover Kohl analysis also demonstrates that the public interest can be

achieved by constructing equal numbers of housing units but with far fewer wetlands impacts.

127. The Corps' public interest review failed to consider relevant factors, including

the dramatic impact the Cainhoy development will have on wetlands and the resulting flood
hazards and impacts to floodplain values. The Corps Permit allows 45% of the development
acreage to be constructed in the 100-year floodplain and at risk of inundation, a risk that grows

as sea levels continue to rise due to climate change.

C. EPA Review of the Permit

128. In an email to the Corps on May 3, 2018, EPA acknowledged that "the impacts
are large" and requested clarification on five issues through a series of bullet points. Id. at 65.

129. Those issues were: (1) the 50-year permit term, (2) a 5-6-acre wetland near the

Point Hope Nature Sanctuary; (3) the qualifications of the steward for the land trust; (4) the
expected dock restrictions and allowances; and (5) the measurement of wetlands restoration

success. See id. at 65-66.

130. The Corps sent the Applicants' response to EPA on August 26, 2019. See id. at

70.

28

2:22-cv-02727-RMG Date Filed 08/17/22 Entry Number 1 Page 29 of 41

131. In an email to the Corps on September 25, 2019, EPA wrote that "[a]s the

wetland impacts of the project are still large (approx. 182ac), EPA would welcome additional

avoidance and minimization but we appreciate the applicant addressing all five of our previous

comments and offer no additional comments at this time." Id.

132. EPA failed to opine on, or consider, the Dover Kohl alternatives demonstrating

that the Cainhoy development was not the least damaging practicable alternative. EPA also failed

to object to or veto the Permit.

D. The Corps' NEPA Compliance

133. The Corps issued an EA for the Cainhoy Plantation, declining to prepare an EIS.

134. In the EA, the Corps defined the scope of analysis for purposes of NEPA as "the

entire 9,076-acre property, including both uplands and wetlands, due to the extent and

configuration of the wetlands that will be impacted by this project." Id. at 10.

135. The Corps concluded that an EIS was not required because the permitted action

would not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment.

136. In reaching its finding of no significant impact, the Corps explained that
although the impacts to 181.5 acres of wetlands "could be considered to have potentially

significant impacts," the compensatory mitigation plan offsets adverse effects "such that the net

result would be less than significant impacts to the quality of the human environment." Id. at 213

137. The Corps' finding of no significant impact disregarded the significant impact

the Cainhoy development will have on wetlands, endangered species, public safety, historic and

cultural resources, and ecologically tical areas.

29

2:22-cv-02727-RMG Date Filed 08/17/22 Entry Number 1 Page 30 of 41

E. The Service's Biological Opinion

138. On May 23, 2018, the Corps initiated formal consultation with the Service on the

Permit for Cainhoy regarding impacts to endangered RCWs. Biological Opinion at 1.

139. Red-cockaded woodpeckers were listed as endangered in 1970 and at the time of
listing, fewer than 10,000 individuals remained. Id. at 8 9. An almost complete loss of habitat

was the primary driver of RCW decline due to extensive cutting, conversion of forest land to

agriculture and other non-forest uses, and fire suppression. Id. at 9, U.S. Fish and Wildlife

Service, Special Status Assessment Report For the Red-cockaded Woodpecker at 73 (2020),

https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/DownloadFile/188805 ("2020 SSA"). The primary threats

identified in the Recovery Plan for the RCW all had the same basic causelack of suitable

habitat. Biological Opinion at 13.

140. "The life history of RCWs is closely tied to the occurrence of fire-maintained

old growth pine forests that once dominated the southeastern United States." Id. at 9. "Only 3

million acres of longleaf pine forest remain of the estimated 60 to 92 million acres once in

existence" due to "harvesting for agriculture, short timber rotations, and the suppression of fire,

[which] reduced the amount and quality of RCW foraging and nesting habitat." Id.

141. Today, the longleaf pine ecosystems on which RCWs depend "are [ ] among the
most endangered systems on earth.' 2020 SSA at 73. "Many ecologists consider fire suppression

to be the primary reason for the degradation of remaining longleaf pine forests." U.S. Fish and

Wildlife Service, Francis Marion National Forest Revised Land Management Plan Biological

Opinion at 34 (2016), https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd531030.pdf.

142. Cainhoy has nearly 3,000 acres of contiguous longleaf pine habitat. Biological

Opinion at 5.

30

2:22-cv-02727-RMG Date Filed 08/17/22 Entry Number 1 Page 31 of 41

143. Although RCW population numbers have improved since their listing in 1970,

the majority of RCW populations still have low to very low resilience to withstanding impacts.

2020 SSA at 106-08, 117.

144. On November 15, 2018, the Service issued a Biological Opinion for the Cainhoy

Plantation.

145. In the Biological Opinion, the Service limited, without explanation, the action

area to Cainhoy Plantation, the on-site compensatory mitigation areas, Cheeha Combahee

Plantation, Ashepoo Plantation, and Hitchcock Woods. Biological Opinion at 5.

146. The Service did not include the FMNF in the action area.2 Id.

147. Cainhoy shares a two-mile border with the FMNF, a national forest that is home

to many species protected by the ESA, including RCWs, northern long-eared bats, and frosted

flatwoods salamanders. Biological Opinion at 4

148. The RCW Recovery Plan designated 13 primary core populations, including the

FMNF population. Id. at 14.

149. The Cainhoy RCWs are demographically connected to the FMNF population

and the two populations function in concert with each other. Id., see also Letter from Dr. J.H.

Carter III, Environmental Consultant, to Christopher DeScherer, SELC, 3-4 (Oct. 21, 2020)

(Exhibit 5) ("Carter Letter"); Letter from Ralph Costa, RCWO LLC, to Susan Smythe, Womble

Bond Dickson, LLC, 3-4 (Sept. 18, 2020) (Exhibit 6) ("Costa Letter").

Confusingly, the Service correctly included in FMNF when is assessed the environmental baseline; that is, the current status of the species in the action area. Biological Opinion at 13-16.

31

2:22-cv-02727-RMG Date Filed 08/17/22 Entry Number 1 Page 32 of 41

150. The Cainhoy RCWs provide fledging recruitment to the FMNF population and

in turn support the demographic stability of the FMNF population. Biological Opinion at 25,

Carter Letter at 3-4, Costa Letter at 3-4.

151. Without the Cainhoy Plantation RCWs and habitat, the FMNF RCWs near

Cainhoy will become edge groups, which tend to be less stable. Carter Letter at 3-4, Costa Letter

at 3-4.

152. While failing to include the FMNF that abuts the site in the action area, the

Service included two plantations in the Ashepoo, Combahee, and Edisto Basin ("ACE Basin")

Cheeha Combahee Plantation and Ashepoo Plantation-and Hitchcock Woods in Aiken, which
are over 30 miles away from the Cainhoy development. Biological Opinion at 5. These areas
were included because the Applicants funded translocations of RCWs from the FMNF to those

three properties in an effort to offset the eventual extirpation of RCWs from Cainhoy. Id.

153. The translocations established new RCW colonies in the ACE Basin and

Hitchcock Woods.

154. As of May 2018, SCDNR noted that the population growth for these new

colonies appeared weak. Decision Document at 34-35. The new populations will also remain

small and isolated from larger demographic populations.

155. Turning to project impacts, the Service considered beneficial, indirect, direct,

and cumulative effects. Biological Opinion at 24-26.

156. The Service cited the translocations as beneficial effects, as well as the

Applicants' agreement to provide appropriate habitat management activities for RCWs on the
property for as long as development plans allow. Biological Opinion at 24 -25. The Service also

32

2:22-cv-02727-RMG Date Filed 08/17/22 Entry Number 1 Page 33 of 41

noted that the Applicants' agreement to not immediately extirpate all RCWs on Cainhoy would

benefit the greater FMNF population by providing continued recruitment. Id.

157. The Service determined that direct effects of the action included land clearing
efforts and real estate development activities within occupied RCW habitat that would result in

the incidental take of RCW clusters due to habitat destruction. Biological Opinion at 25.

158. In assessing indirect effects, the Service stated that those effects "include the

reduction of future RCWs in the Cainhoy population available to replace breeding vacancies in

the remaining Cainhoy RCW groups[,] .. increase[ing] their likelihood of extirpation prior to

[direct habitat destruction from] . .. real estate development. Id. That is, with each cluster that

the development takes, the remaining clusters on the property are increasingly less likely to

survive long enough to be directly impacted by habitat clearing.

159. The Service did not consider any direct or indirect effects to the FMNF of

placing a large-scale development next to the forest or of eliminating RCWs and RCW habitat on

the property, including effects from reduced fledgling recruitment, loss of foraging habitat, or

creation of edge habitat.

160. The Service also failed to consider the impact of fire suppression on FMNF fire-

dependent species, like RCWs. The U.S. Forest Service Regional Fire Ecologist provided

comments to the Service stating that "the Cainhoy Plantation .. . could considerably negatively

impact the needed management of fire-adapted threatened and endangered species on the

[FMNF]" and emphasizing that the Forest Service "needs to continue burning the area adjacent
to and within several miles of the proposed Cainhoy development, and the development may

seriously affect [the Forest Service's] opportunities to do so." Email from Beth Buchanan, U.S.

Forest Service, to Rhea Whalen, U.S. Forest Service (Nov. 1, 2018) (Exhibit 7).

33

2:22-cv-02727-RMG Date Filed 08/17/22 Entry Number 1 Page 34 of 41

161. The Service also failed to consider climate change impacts. Climate change will

lead to RCW habitat degradation and/or loss in myriad ways, including increased storm intensity,

habitat destruction, and heat waves. 2020 SSA at 90, 121.

162. Following the effects analysis, the Service determined that the Cainhoy

development would result in the loss of 11 RCW clusters on Cainhoy. Biological Opinion at 26.

163. The Service concluded that take of 11 RCW clusters would not jeopardize the

continued existence of the species because 11 RCW clusters represent less than 2% of the larger

Mid-Atlantic demographic population, and the loss of 11 groups "[would] not significantly

reduce the FMNF-Bonneau Ferry WMA-Santee Coastal Reserve WMA demographic

population." Id.

164. The Incidental Take Statement included in the Biological Opinion set the take

limit as 11 RCW clusters and directed the Corps to reinitiate consultation if the amount or extent

of take is exceeded. Id. at 27, 29.

165. However, the Biological Opinion also stated that the Service "offer[ed] the

Applicants 'Safe Harbor-like Assurances' that no further regulatory obligations will be necessary

if additional occupation by RCWs occur on Cainhoy Plantation." Id. at 24, see also Decision

Document at 34 ("The Biological Opinion includes safe harbor like assurances and allows for the

take of [11] baseline [clusters], above baseline [clusters,] and future RCW groups on Cainhoy

Plantation for the life of the permit.").

166. That is, the Service authorized take of more than 11 RCW clusters, without

considering whether take of more than 11 RCW clusters would jeopardize the continued

existence of the species or significantly reduce the FMNF-Bonneau Ferry WMA-Santee Coastal

Reserve WMA demographic population.

34

2:22-cv-02727-RMG Date Filed 08/17/22 Entry Number 1 Page 35 of 41

167. It is also unclear whether the Corps must reinitiate consultation if more than 11

RCW clusters are taken.

CLAIMS FOR RELIEF

FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF

(Violation of CWA - Corps Unlawfully Violated Section 404 of the CWA and Applicable Regulations)

168. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs.

169. The CWA requires the preparation of an alternatives analysis before the issuance

of any section 404 permit.

170. As part of the Cainhoy alternatives analysis, the Corps developed criteria to

measure the practicability of each possible development site.

171. One of these criteria required 5,000 acres of developable uplands on any

potential development site.

172. The Cainhoy Plantation has just over 4,500 acres of developable uplands, but the
Corps arbitrarily explained that Cainhoy satisfied this criterion and unlawfully issued the Permit

for the Cainhoy development.

173. The Corps also wrongly determined that the Cainhoy development was the least
environmentally damaging practicable alternative in the face of record evidencenamely the

Dover Kohl plandemonstrating the existence of alternatives that even the Corps admitted were

"feasible" and which would have far fewer impacts to wetlands.

174. The Corps also violated the CWA by issuing the Permit for the Cainhoy

Plantation that will result in significant degradation-the destruction of over 180 acres of

wetlands- to waters of the United States, including impacts to Aquatic Resources of National

Importance.

35

2:22-cv-02727-RMG Date Filed 08/17/22 Entry Number 1 Page 36 of 41

175. The Corps also violated the CWA by approving the Cainhoy Plantation Permit

without a demonstration that the applicant has taken all practicable steps to avoid and minimize

impacts to waters of the United States. Again, the Dover Kohl plan and the comments of other

expert agencies demonstrate the lack of avoidance and minimization.

176. Finally, the Corps' public interest review violated the CWA because it failed to

consider that the housing needs in the growing Charleston area could be satisfied by the Dover

Kohl plan with far fewer wetlands impacts and far fewer homes placed in the floodplain.

177. The Corps' public interest review also failed to consider the unnecessary
placement of thousands of homes in the floodplain. A development project with the same

number of housing units, but with fewer wetland impacts and fewer of those housing units placed

in vulnerable locations would better serve the public interest.

178. For all of these reasons, the Corps' issuance of the Permit for the Cainhoy
Plantation violated section 404 of the CWA, 33 U.S.C. § 1344, and its implementing regulations,

40 C.F.R. Part 230.3

SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF

(Violation of CWA - EPA Unlawfully Violated Section 404 of the CWA and Applicable
Regulations)

179. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs.

180. Pursuant to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit's decision in
Hanson, "[i]t is quite clear that both the Corps and the EPA are responsible for the issuance of

3 Pursuant to the Fourth Circuit's decision in Hanson, 859 F.2d at 315-16, the Corps' violations
of the CWA in issuing the Permit are properly pleaded under the CWA citizen suit provision. 33 U.S.C. § 1365. § In the alternative, however, the Corps actions in issuing the Permit were arbitrary, capricious, and in violation of the CWA, and hereby cognizable under the APA, 5 U.S.C. §
706(2).

36

2:22-cv-02727-RMG Date Filed 08/17/22 Entry Number 1 Page 37 of 41

permits under the CWA and enforcement of their terms.. .. The EPA is ultimately responsible

for the protection of wetlands." 859 F.2d at 315-16.

181. EPA failed to exercise its mandatory duty of oversight imposed by the CWA,

including section 404.

182. By failing to object to the issuance of the Permit for the Cainhoy Plantation or to

veto the Permit, EPA has sanctioned the Corps' failures and abdicated its ultimate responsibility

to protect wetlands.

183. For these reasons, EPA's actions in approving the Cainhoy Plantation Permit

violated section 404 of the CWA, 33 U.S.C. § 1344, and its implementing regulations, 40 C.F.R.

Part 230.4

THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF

(Violation of NEPA and APA - The Corps Acted Arbitrarily and Capriciously and Not in
Accordance with Law in Issuing the Decision Document and EA)

184. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs.

185. In an EA, the agency must take a hard look at the environmental impacts of the
proposed activity, including direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts. 40 C.F.R. §§ 1502.1,
1508.7, 1508.8. The agency must also evaluate a reasonable range of alternatives. 42 U.S.C. §
4332(C)(iii), (E); 40 C.F.R. § 1508.9(b). An agency may decline to prepare an EIS only if it
prepares an EA that takes hard look at the effects of the action and makes a reasonable finding

that there will be no significant impact.

In the alternative, the EPA's failure to exercise its mandatory duty of CWA oversight
constituted an "agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed," in violation of the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 706(1).

37

2:22-cv-02727-RMG Date Filed 08/17/22 Entry Number 1 Page 38 of 41

186. The Corps violated NEPA by preparing an EA that failed to take a hard look at
the direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental impacts of the proposed Cainhoy Plantation;
failed to examine a reasonable range of alternatives; and was not based on high-quality

information and accurate analysis of the effects of the action.

187. The Corps' issuance of the EA and Finding of No Significant Impact for the

planned development are final agency actions that are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of

discretion, not in accordance with law, and without observance of procedure required by law, 5
U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (D), and violations of NEPA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321 et seq.

FOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF

(Violation of NEPA and APA - The Corps Acted Arbitrarily and Capriciously and Not in
Accordance with Law in Failing to Prepare an EIS for the Cainhoy Plantation)

188. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs.

189. NEPA requires federal agencies to conduct environmental reviews of major

federal actions that may significantly affect the environment. 42 U.S.C. § 4332(C). If an action is

likely to significantly affect the environment, an agency must prepare an EIS. Id.

190. The significance of a major federal action is determined through the

consideration of ten factors. 40 C.F.R. 1508.27 (1978).

191. A finding of significance under any of the ten factors may require the

preparation of an EIS.

192. The proposed Cainhoy Plantation is significant under many of the ten factors to

be considered under 40 C.F.R. $1508.27 (1978), including the unique risks posed regarding
flooding and development within the floodplain; the degree to which the proposed action affects

public health or safety; the project's impact on 180 acres of wetlands; and its impact on listed

species, among other factors.

38

2:22-cv-02727-RMG Date Filed 08/17/22 Entry Number 1 Page 39 of 41

193. The Corps failed to prepare an EIS for the Cainhoy Plantation.

194. The Corps' failure to prepare an EIS for the Cainhoy Plantation constitutes an

"agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed," in violation of the APA. 5 U.S.C.

§ 706(1).

FIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF

(Violation of APA - The Service's Biological Opinion is Arbitrary, Capricious,
and Not in Accordance with Law)

195. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs.

196. The Biological Opinion arbitrarily excluded, without explanation, the FMNF

from the action area.

197. The Biological Opinion acknowledged that the Cainhoy Plantation will degrade

thousands of acres of RCW habitat adjacent to the FMNF, could drastically affect the Forest

Service's ability to use prescribed fire, and will extirpate RCWs from the property, which

provide fledgling recruitment to the larger FMNF demographic population.

198. Despite this, the Service failed to consider impacts of the project on FMNF

RCWs.

199. The Biological Opinion failed to consider impacts of climate change on the local

RCW population. "'[G]eneral[]' discussion of the effects of climate change [is] insufficient when

other documents in the record hint[ ] at climate impacts within the action area." Appalachian

Voices, 25 F.4th at 276 (citing Wild Fish Conservancy v. Irving, 221 F. Supp. 3d 1224, 1233-34

(4th Cir. 2016)).

200. The Biological Opinion provided "safe harbor-like assurances" for the take of all

future RCWs in the project area, yet reached its no-jeopardy determination based on take of only
11 RCW clusters currently on the property.

39

2:22-cv-02727-RMG Date Filed 08/17/22 Entry Number 1 Page 40 of 41

201. The Biological Opinion's safe harbor assurances contradict the take limit

included in the Incidental Take Statement. As a result, it is not clear whether take of more than

11 RCW clusters requires the Corps to reinitiate consultation.

202. The Service's Biological Opinion is arbitrary and capricious in violation of the

APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully requests that the Court:

A. Declare that the Corps and EPA violated the CWA;

B. Declare that the Corps violated NEPA and the APA;

C. Declare that the Service violated the APA and ESA;

D. Vacate the Corps' and EPA's section 404 Permit;

E. Vacate the Corps' Environmental Assessment and Decision Document;

F. Vacate the Service's Biological Opinion and Incidental Take Statement;

G. Enjoin Defendants from taking any actions to dredge or fill wetlands under the

Permit until Defendants comply with all the requirements of the CWA, NEPA, ESA, and APA;

H. Grant Plaintiffs their costs of suit, including reasonable attorneys' fees to the

extent authorized by law; and

I. Grant Plaintiffs such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

waters for leasing, which the plaintiffs alleged would be one of the
largest offshore lease sales in U.S. history. The complaint alleged
that the final supplemental EIS prepared by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) failed to take a hard look at the lease sale's impacts. With respect to climate change, the plaintiffs contended that BOEM relied on "problematic modeling and
assumptions to conclude that this massive lease will result in
only 'slightly higher domestic emissions' than not leasing at all, and further failed to consider the impacts of such fossil fuel development on climate goals and commitments," including the
lease sale's impact on the remaining global carbon budget ("the amount of carbon dioxide equivalent that can be emitted without exceeding the Paris Agreement limit of 1.5°C of warming above pre-industrial levels"). The plaintiffs also alleged that BOEM failed to consider climate impacts such as sea level rise, flooding, and
increased storms on Gulf of Mexico communities and cumulative
climate impacts of other Gulf oil and gas leasing and reasonably foreseeable oil and gas infrastructure projects. On March 22,

INTRODUCTION

1. This case concerns whether the Nation's commitment to preserving our critical

wildlife habitat and treasured coastal landscapes must be sacrificed as we reach out to explore

the cosmos-a question with national, global, and even interstellar implications. It is also about

whether regulators will hold powerful corporations accountable or allow them to disregard

environmental laws simply because of their political and financial influence. As the Nation

carries out the modern era of spaceflight, we must decide whether we will protect the wildlife

and frontline communities that can be adversely affected by our desire to reach the stars, or

whether we will leave a legacy of needless destruction in the scorching wake of rocket plumes.

2. Here, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which has federal authority

over the launching of vehicles into space, has authorized the SpaceX Starship/Super Heavy

Launch Vehicle Program at Boca Chica, Texas, without complying with bedrock federal

Case 1:23-cv-01204 Document 1 Filed 05/01/23 Page 2 of 32

environmental law, without fully analyzing the significant environmental and community

impacts of the SpaceX launch program-including destruction of some of the most vital

migratory bird habitat in North America- and without requiring mitigation sufficient to offset

those impacts.

3. On June 13, 2022, FAA issued a Final Programmatic Environmental Assessment

and Finding of no Significant Impact/Record of Decision (FONSI/ROD) for the SpaceX

Starship/Super Heavy Launch Vehicle Program, which approved SpaceX's plan to launch 20

Starship/Super Heavy rockets per year over the next 5 years, along with tank tests, static fire

engine tests, and construction of additional launch related infrastructure. On April 14, 2023, the

FAA issued a Commercial Space Transportation License to SpaceX, which, relying on the

FONSI/ROD, allowed the company to launch the first flight of the Starship-Super Heavy

vehicle, and to undertake pre-flight ground operations, such as tank testing and static fire tests,

over the 5 next 5 years.

4. The Super Heavy is the world's most powerful rocket. It holds up to 3,700 metric

tons of liquid methane for propulsion, a potent greenhouse gas that will need to be vented into

the atmosphere by SpaceX. The launching of these rockets results in intense heat, noise, and light

that adversely affects surrounding habitat areas and communities, which include designated

critical habitat for federally protected species as well as National Wildlife Refuge and State Park

lands.

5. SpaceX undertook the first launch of the Starship/Super Heavy rocket on April

20, 2023. Just minutes into the launch, the rocket exploded. Furthermore, the launch pad was

destroyed, scattering debris and ash over a large area, including adjacent lands that provide

habitat for endangered species. While the FAA subsequently stated that it was temporarily

Case 1:23-cv-01204 Document 1 Filed 05/01/23 Page 3 of 32 3

grounding the rocket, it has not withdrawn or modified the FONSI/ROD and SpaceX has stated

its intent to continue the program with further launches in the coming months. FAA has not

announced any plans to initiate a supplemental review process pursuant to NEPA to consider the

human health and environmental impacts associated with the explosion, including reports of

sand, ash, and concrete being blown up to several miles away and outside the area that FAA had

previously considered.

6. The area surrounding the SpaceX facility at Boca Chica a is a biologically diverse

and essential habitat area for many species, including federally protected wildlife and animals

that are considered sacred to the Carrizo/Comecrudo People, such as the critically endangered

ocelot. The SpaceX facility is smack in the middle of publicly owned conservation, park, and

recreation lands, including a National Wildlife Refuge, two State Parks, a State Wildlife

Management Area, and a State Coastal Preserve. These lands are of extraordinary conservation
value for a range of federally and state listed wildlife and other protected species such as
migratory birds. Bird species from both the Central and Mississippi flyways converge there,

it making it an essential wintering and stopover area for migratory birds as they move north and

south each year.

7. SpaceX activities authorized in the FONSI/ROD have and will adversely affect

the surrounding wildlife habitat and communities. In addition to harm from construction

activities and increased vehicle traffic, rocket launches result in intense heat, noise, and light

pollution. Furthermore, the rocket launches and testing result in explosions which spread debris

across surrounding habitat and cause brush/forest fires-including one that recently burned 68

acres of adjacent National Wildlife Refuge. The FAA calls these explosions "anomalies," but in

fact they occur frequently, with at least 8 over the past 5 years. FAA has acknowledged that

2

Case 1:23-cv-01204 Document 1 Filed 05/01/23 Page 4 of 32

many more such "anomalies" are expected over the next 5 years. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife

Service has found that prior SpaceX rocket explosions harmed protected wildlife and designated

critical habitat in violation of the Endangered Species Act (ESA).

8. SpaceX activities also require frequent closures of the nearby Boca Chica Beach,

which provides the public free use and enjoyment of a largely undeveloped and secluded

coastline along the Gulf Coast. The only access road has been closed on over 100 different dates

per year to accommodate SpaceX activities, and the FAA has allowed such closures to continue.
These closures have a significant adverse impact on the local community, including the

Carrizo/Comecrudo Nation of Texas, which considers Boca Chica a sacred site, and others that

rely on the Beach for recreation and subsistence fishing.

9. The FAA's Chief of Staff for the Office of Commercial Space Transportation

initially stated that the FAA planned to conduct a new environmental impact statement (EIS) for

the Starship/Super Heavy Launch Vehicle Program to analyze the environmental impacts of the
program pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA); however, the FAA

subsequently delegated that decision to SpaceX and did not prepare an EIS to analyze the launch

program, even though permitting SpaceX to launch the largest rockets known to humankind is

the type of significant federal action that requires full analysis in an EIS. Rather, based on

a SpaceX's preference, FAA relied on a programmatic environmental assessment (PEA) prepared

by SpaceX for NEPA compliancea considerably less thorough analysis intended only to

determine whether an EIS is required- -and issued a mitigated finding of no significant impact

(FONSI). A mitigated FONSI suggests that the proposed action would have significant

environmental impacts, but that certain required mitigation efforts would reduce those impacts

such that an EIS is not required.

3

Case 1:23-cv-01204 Document 1 Filed 05/01/23 Page 5 of 32

10. The proposed mitigation measures in the PEA are insufficient in many respects,

and the FAA failed entirely to explain how the proposed mitigation measures would reduce the

considerable environmental impacts of the launch program below the level of "significance" for

purposes of NEPA.

11. Many of the proposed mitigation measures are inadequate to prevent the SpaceX

launch program from causing significant environmental harm. For example, FAA failed to

ensure that the environmental impacts from "anomalies" would be sufficiently mitigated,

requiring only after-the-fact consultation with expert agencies, such as the Fish and Wildlife

Service, about recovering exploded rocket fragments from adjacent habitat areas. No mitigation

efforts have been imposed to prevent or minimize "anomalies" from occurring in the first place,

or to reduce the direct impacts from debris raining down on ESA-designated critical habitat or

the resulting brush fires. Likewise, the PEA does not include adequate mitigation to address

impacts to sensitive wildlife, such as the restoration and enhancement of habitat affected by the

noise, heat, and light from rocket launches.

12. FAA also violated NEPA by failing to consider a reasonable range of alternatives.

It considered only SpaceX's proposed project and a "no action" alternative. It did not a consider

an alternative with fewer launches per year to minimize and mitigate the impacts of the launch

program, nor did it provide sufficient support for eliminating the Kennedy Space Center as a
viable alternative location to the Boca Chica site, even though SpaceX has apparently been

modifying a launch pad at Kennedy Space Center to accommodate Starship rockets and has itself

suggested Kennedy as an alternative launch site.

13. FAA also failed to take a hard look at the a environmental impacts of the SpaceX

launch program, as NEPA requires, including increased light, heat, and environmental pollution,

4

Case 1:23-cv-01204 Document 1 Filed 05/01/23 Page 6 of 32

as well as risk of wildfires, damage to critical habitat, and the launch program's contribution to

climate change.

14. In sum, the environmental impacts of the Starship/Super Heavy Launch Vehicle

Program cannot be reduced through mitigation such that FAA can ensure that there will not be

significant harm from the launch program, and FAA failed entirely to even address how the

proposed mitigation could achieve that level of protection. Therefore, the FAA's failure to fully

consider and address the impacts of the Starship/Super Heavy Launch Vehicle Program through

an EIS (including the impacts of the failed April 20 launch), and its failure to consider
alternatives that would reduce the impacts of the launch program, was arbitrary and capricious,
in violation of NEPA and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The Court should vacate the
FONSI and accompanying Record of Decision, and remand with instructions that the FAA

perform a full EIS.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

15. This case arises under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C.

§§ 4321 et seq., and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706. This Court

has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 cop U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question) and 28 U.S.C. §

1346 (action against the United States). The Court may grant the relief requested under the APA,

5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706, and 28 U.S.C. § 2201-02 (declaratory and injunctive relief).

16. Venue is appropriate in this Court under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) because FAA

resides in this judicial district.

PARTIES

Plaintiffs

17. Plaintiff Center for Biological Diversity (the Center) is a national nonprofit

organization that works through science, law, and policy to secure a future for all species, great

or small, hovering on the brink of extinction. The Center has over 87,000 members worldwide.

The Center has worked for decades to safeguard habitats for people, plants, and animals. The

Center's members value and benefit from rare species' continued existence in the wild and are

harmed by industrial development and associated trends like global climate change, water

degradation, and habitat loss that threaten wild species' survival and recovery. The Center has

worked for years to protect wildlife that will be harmed by SpaceX's Starship/Super Heavy

Launch Vehicle Program, including migratory birds and other protected species that rely on the

Boca Chica area.

18. Plaintiff American Bird Conservancy (ABC) is a nonprofit organization dedicated

to conserving wild birds and their habitats throughout the Americas. ABC has been working for
nearly thirty years to protect threatened birds from population decline. ABC members derive

recreational, conservation, aesthetic, and other benefits from the ecosystems and species of the

Gulf of Mexico and its coastline, including Boca Chica Beach, the Lower Rio Grande Valley

National Wildlife Refuge, Brazos Island State Park, and Las Palomas Wildlife Management Area

Boca Chica Unit, which all surround the Space X site.

19. Plaintiff Surfrider Foundation is a grassroots, nonprofit organization dedicated to

the protection and enjoyment of the world's ocean, waves and beaches for all people. Surfrider

has more than 350,000 supporters and members, 79 local chapters, and 92 school clubs in the

United States, and maintains five local chapters in Texas, including the South Texas Chapter

6

Case 1:23-cv-01204 Document 1 Filed 05/01/23 Page 8 of 32

based on South Padre Island. Surfrider members reside, recreate, use, and otherwise regularly

access Boca Chica Beach and have been negatively impacted by the SpaceX operations,

including the frequent beach closures. Surfrider members also look for, study, photograph, and

enjoy marine and terrestrial species in Cameron County, including the piping plover and several
species of sea turtles that are likely to be harmed by SpaceX activities. For example, Surfrider

has members who visit Boca Chica Beach and the South Texas coast often to surf, fish, and

otherwise explore the coast. Surfrider member's future use and enjoyment of Boca Chica Beach

and the Cameron County coastline depends on healthy coastal ecosystem and accessible beaches.

20. Plaintiff a Save RGV is a nonprofit organization that advocates for environmental

justice and sustainability through addressing the causes and consequences of habitat loss and

climate change that affect the health and well-being of the entire Rio Grande Valley community.

Through its advocacy, research, and publications, Save RGV promotes, monitors, and preserves

wildlife and its habitat and protects air and water quality and the natural resources of the Rio

Grande Valley. Save RGV also serves to protect and defend the public's right to access public

lands, which includes Boca Chica State Park and beach.

21. Plaintiff the Carrizo/Comecrudo Nation of Texas, Inc. is a Texas nonprofit

membership organization dedicated to serving the cultural, social, educational, spiritual,

linguistic, economic, health, and traditional needs of its members and descendants of the
Carrizo/Comecrudo Nation of Texas and other indigenous or Native American groups. The Tribe

members live by their mission of preserving, maintaining, protecting, and offering services that

will better their tribal communities to overcome the erasure of the Original People of Texas. The

Tribe promotes wellness and health by providing services in times of crisis. The Tribe seeks to
protect ancestral lands and relatives and to honor their ancestors. Boca Chica Beach and the area

N

Case 1:23-cv-01204 Document 1 Filed 05/01/23 Page 9 of 32

surrounding the beach are vital and sacred to the Carrizo/Comecrudo People and their ancestral

traditions. The Tribe regularly holds ceremonial life ways at Boca Chica Beach, including during
the equinox and solstice. These ceremonies typically involve between 20 and 30 of the Tribe's

members, during which the members leave offerings for ancestors at the beach.

22. In bringing this lawsuit, Plaintiffs stand in the shoes of members who live, work,

and recreate in places threatened by SpaceX's activities at Boca Chica and who use, study, and

cherish the land, water, wildlife, and other resources that will be irrevocably damaged by the

activities permitted by the FAA. Plaintiffs have numerous members who live in areas directly

affected by these activities and/or visit the area to observe wildlife, and Plaintiffs' members and

staff include individuals who study and advocate for better protection of wildlife and other

resources threatened by SpaceX's activities permitted by FAA. The FAA's failure to comply

with the requirements of NEPA delays, avoids, and undermines protections that are necessary to

secure Plaintiffs' interests in the habitats and wildlife impacted by the SpaceX launch program.

23. Plaintiffs have members whose interests are adversely affected by direct, indirect,

and cumulative harm from the FAA-authorized activities to habitat areas that such members use

and enjoy, including as habitat for ESA-listed wildlife. For example, Mary Angela Branch-who
grew up in Brownsville and is a member of the Center, ABC, and Save RGV-regularly visits
the Boca Chica area to enjoy the beach and to swim, picnic, fish, and view wildlife, including
protected birds. She plans to continue visiting the area; however, her ability to enjoy Boca Chica

beach and the surrounding areas and the wildlife they support has been, and will continue to be,

adversely affected by SpaceX activities, including through closures to accommodate SpaceX

construction and launch activities as well as from the noise, heat, light, explosions, and fires

associated with such activities.

8

Case 1:23-cv-01204 Document 1 Filed 05/01/23 Page 10 of 32

24. Plaintiffs also have members that have researched, studied, observed, and sought

protection for habitats and species that are adversely affected by the SpaceX activities authorized

by FAA. For example, Jim Chapman, a member of Save RGV who lives in Weslaco, TX, works
to protect the Santa Ana and Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuges, and advocates

for the animals that use the tracks of brush and forest habitat to migrate between populations. Mr.
Chapman is highly invested in the preservation of the Boca Chica area, as it is essential for many
of the native wildlife which he seeks out and enjoys. Mr. Chapman regularly visits the Boca
Chica area to view wildlife, particularly birds such as the protected plovers and migratory
species that rely on the area. Mr. Chapman is passionate about the native wildlife and enjoys
exposing people to the unique ecosystems of the region. His interests in observing and protecting

the Boca Chica area have been, and will continue to be, adversely affected by the SpaceX

activities permitted by FAA, including harm from closures, increased vehicle traffic and

resulting collisions with wildlife, the intense noise, heat, and light from rocket launch and testing

activities, and "anomalies."

25. Plaintiffs' members have visited and observed or sought out species that are

imperiled by SpaceX activities, and enjoy hiking, fishing, and observing wildlife in areas that are
impacted by such activities. Plaintiffs' members intend to continue to visit and observe, or

attempt to visit and observe, these areas and species in the near future. For example, Bryan

Newman-a member of the Center-lives in Minnesota, but has travelled to south Texas,

including the Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge directly adjacent to the SpaceX facility

at Boca Chica, in order to observe wildlife, including ESA-listed piping plovers as well as the
many migratory bird species that rely on the Boca Chica area, and he plans to return to the area

in the Spring of 2023 to once again observe wildlife. While visiting the area in March of 2021,

Case 1:23-cv-01204 Document 1 Filed 05/01/23 Page 11 of 32

Mr. Newman watched a SpaceX rocket launch from Isla Blanca, which ended up exploding in a

fiery blast. Mr. Newman derives personal, aesthetic, moral, and recreational benefits from the

continued existence of wildlife in the Boca Chica area. The degradation of habitat or the loss of
wildlife from SpaceX's activities will harm Mr. Newman's interests in observing and protecting
the wildlife of this critically important area.

26. FAA's approval of the SpaceX launch program at Boca Chica therefore threatens

the use, enjoyment, and economic value of property owned by Plaintiffs' members, as well as the

lands and waters that members use and enjoy both as a resource and for the habitat they provide

for plants and animals. The impacts from SpaceX construction activities and rocket launches,

including "anomalies," would interfere with members' use and enjoyment of the Boca Chica area

and the wildlife it supports.

27. Plaintiffs' ability to use and enjoy the area around the SpaceX launch facility-
including public lands and beaches that are intended for public use, such as state parks and
National Wildlife Refuge lands-is also directly impeded by the SpaceX launch program due to
closures of the area to accommodate construction of the facility as well as rocket launches. These

closures adversely affect Plaintiffs' members' interests in continuing to use these areas for

recreation. For example, the closures have adversely affected Mrs. Branch, who regularly visits

Boca Chica Beach, and whose visits have been cut short or cancelled due to unannounced

closures.

28. The beach closures have also impacted the Carrizo/Comecrudo Nation's ability to

hold their traditional ceremonial life ways and leave offerings for their ancestors. For example,
Juan Mancias, a member of the Tribe, has been prevented from accessing the beach, a space

sacred to him, to leave offerings to his ancestors, because of the frequent beach closures that

10

Case 1:23-cv-01204 Document 1 Filed 05/01/23 Page 12 of 32

have occurred for purposes of SpaceX activities. Participating in activities that are spiritually

sacred to him depends upon his ability to access Boca Chica Beach; therefore, the closures

directly affect Mr. Mancia's cultural, social, and spiritual interest in the area.

29. Plaintiffs' members thus derive scientific, recreational, spiritual, and aesthetic

benefits from the areas affected by SpaceX activities. Their interest in maintaining the wildlife

and habitats that would be affected by SpaceX activities is entirely dependent on the continued

existence of healthy, sustainable, and accessible ecosystems and populations. Any activities that

degrade or diminish these areas, or that kill, injure, harm, harass, or displace wildlife or that

close beach access, interfere with Plaintiffs' members' use and enjoyment of the areas and

species.

30. Plaintiffs' members include scientists who study various threatened and

endangered species, and whose interests in studying and enjoying these species and their habitats

are entirely dependent on the continued existence of such species. Any action that interferes with

and harms these species also harms those members' interests and enjoyment in studying those

species. Any loss of individuals or habitat from SpaceX activities would hamper their ability to

undertake such research in the future, thereby harming their academic and aesthetic interests in

those species.

31. Plaintiffs have also sufferec procedural and informational injuries from

Defendants' violations. These injuries are connected to Plaintiffs' substantive recreational,

scientific, spiritual, and aesthetic interests. Plaintiffs' members and staff rely on Defendants to
comply with the requirements of NEPA. Plaintiffs rely on laws such as NEPA to achieve their
organizational purposes, including monitoring the impacts of agency actions on the environment

and species; monitoring legal compliance concerning environmental management; educating

11

Case 1:23-cv-01204 Document 1 Filed 05/01/23 Page 13 of 32

members, directors, staff, and the public concerning species management and the state of the

environment; and advocating for policies that protect habitats and wildlife.

32. Plaintiffs include non-profit conservation organizations with limited resources
that can be dedicated to their core mission to protect the environment, imperiled species, and the

habitats upon which they rely. Defendants' actions impede Plaintiffs' ability to carry out their

fundamental missions, and directly undercut decades of successful work by Plaintiffs to enforce

environmental laws that protect the interests of their members.

33. Defendants' actions have also stifled the flow of data on impacts to the
environment from SpaceX activities that are vital to Plaintiffs' efforts to conserve and protect the

environment. The FAA's failure to comply with its NEPA obligations is therefore harming, and

will continue to harm, Plaintiffs by interfering with Plaintiffs' core organizational missions and

by requiring them to divert their limited resources and personnel away from other activities in an

attempt to fill the gap left by the FAA.

34. These are actual, concrete injuries to Plaintiffs, caused by the FAA's failure to

comply with NEPA. The interests and organizational purposes of Plaintiffs and members are

directly and irreparably injured by Defendants' violations of law as described herein. Unless this

Court grants the requested relief, harm to the environment will continue to accrue, and the
aesthetic, recreational, educational, professional, scientific, spiritual, and conservation interests
of Plaintiffs and their members will continue to be adversely affected.

35. The relief Plaintiffs seek will redress their injuries by requiring the FAA to

comply with NEPA. This relief will give Plaintiffs and their members more comprehensive and

complete information by requiring the FAA to complete an EIS and thereby provide Plaintiffs

and their members with more information regarding SpaceX's threats to habitats, protected

12

Case 1:23-cv-01204 Document 1 Filed 05/01/23 Page 14 of 32

species, and other valued resources. It will allow Plaintiffs, their members and supporters, and

others who are concerned about SpaceX activities, to advocate more effectively for changes to

mitigate the adverse impacts of the Starship/Super Heavy Launch Vehicle Program.

Defendants

36. Defendant FAA is the federal agency charged with administering permits for
commercial space launch activities. The FAA is headquartered in Washington, D.C. It is required
to comply with NEPA when taking any action significantly affecting the environment.

37. Defendant Billy Nolen is the acting Administrator of the FAA, and is

headquartered in Washington, D.C. Plaintiffs bring this action against Mr. Nolen in his official
capacity only. The Administrator of the FAA is required to comply with NEPA when taking any

action significantly affecting the environment.

LEGAL BACKGROUND

The National Environmental Policy Act

38. NEPA is "our basic national charter for protection of the environment." 40 C.F.R.

§ 1500.1(a). NEPA's goals are to (1) "prevent or eliminate damage to the environment and

biosphere," (2) "stimulate the health and welfare" of all people, and (3) "encourage productive

and enjoyable harmony between [hu]man[kind] and [the] environment." 42 U.S.C. § 4321.

39. In creating NEPA, Congress recognized that "each person should enjoy a

healthful environment" and the statute therefore requires that the federal government use all

practicable means to "assure for all Americans safe, healthful, productive, and esthetically and
culturally pleasing surroundings," and to "attain the widest range of beneficial uses of the

environment without degradation, risk to health or safety, or other undesirable and unintended

consequences." Id. § 4331(b)-(c).

13

Case 1:23-cv-01204 Document 1 Filed 05/01/23 Page 15 of 32

40. To fulfill these purposes, NEPA requires that: (1) agencies take a "hard look" at

the environmental impacts of their actions before they occur, thereby ensuring "that the agency,

in reaching its decision, will have available, and will carefully consider, detailed information

concerning significant environmental impacts," and (2) "the relevant information will be made

available to the larger audience that may also play a role in both the decisionmaking process and
the implementation of that decision." Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S.

332, 349 (1989).

41. NEPA seeks to ensure "that environmental information is available to public

officials and citizens before decisions are made and before actions are taken" and to "help public

officials make decisions that are based on understanding of environmental consequences, and

take actions that protect, restore, and enhance the environment." 40 C.F.R. § 1500.1(b), (c).

When the federal government acts before fulfilling its NEPA obligations, courts may set the
action aside until the government complies with NEPA.

42. The purpose of the NEPA process is also to inform federal agency decision-

makers and the public of the "reasonable alternatives" that would "avoid or minimize adverse

impacts or enhance the quality of the human environment." Id. 8 1502.1. This analysis of

alternatives is the "heart" of NEPA, where the agency should "present the environmental impacts

of the proposal and the alternatives in comparative form, thus sharply defining the issues and

providing a clear basis for choice among options." Id. § 1502.14. The agency must "[r]igorously

explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives." Id. § 1502.14(a), (d).

43. NEPA accordingly requires all federal agencies to prepare a "detailed statement"
for any "major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment." 42

U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C). This statement-the EIS-must describe the environmental impacts of the

14

Case 1:23-cv-01204 Document 1 Filed 05/01/23 Page 16 of 32

proposed action. Id. § 4332(2)(C)(i), (ii). The EIS is an "action-forcing device" that ensures

NEPA's goals "are infused into the ongoing programs and actions" of the federal government. 40

C.F.R. § 1502.1.

44. To determine whether a proposed action significantly affects the environment,

and therefore whether an EIS is required, the lead federal agency may first prepare an

environmental assessment (EA). Id. §§ 1501.5.

45. The lead agency must take a "hard look" at the relevant environmental concerns
and alternatives to the proposed action, and must consider short and long-term effects, both

beneficial and adverse effects, effects on public health and safety, and effects that would violate

Federal, State, Tribal, or local law protecting the environment. 40 C.F.R. § 1501.3.

46. If the agency determines, after preparing the EA, that the proposed action does

not require preparation of an EIS, it must then prepare a finding of no significant impact

(FONSI) detailing why the action "will not have a significant effect on the human environment."

40 C.F.R. § 1501.6. Courts have allowed agencies to prepare a "mitigated FONSI" where the

action would otherwise have significant impacts if the agency can show that they can be

mitigated so that that they no longer pose significant environmental harm. However, if the EA

indicates that the federal action may significantly affect the quality of the human environment,

the agency must prepare an EIS.

47. In determining whether to prepare an EIS, the agency must "consider every
significant aspect of the environmental impact of a proposed action." Baltimore Gas & Elec. Co.

V. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 462 U.S. 87, 97 (1983). A determination that significant effects

on the environment will in fact occur is not essential: an EIS must be prepared if substantial
questions are raised whether a project may have a significant effect upon the environment. See 42

15

Case 1:23-cv-01204 Document 1 Filed 05/01/23 Page 17 of 32

U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C) (requiring an evaluation of "any adverse environmental effects which

cannot be avoided should the proposal be implemented," which must examine the environmental

impact of the proposed action "to the fullest extent possible") (emphasis added); 42 U.S.C. §
4332(2)(F) (requiring agencies to consider the "worldwide and long-range character of

environmental problems").

48. NEPA requires federal agencies to analyze both the probability of a given harm

occurring and the consequences of that harm if it does occur. New York v. Nuclear Regulatory

Comm 'n, 681 F.3d 471, 482 (D.C. Cir. 2012). Agencies cannot avoid their responsibility to

consider future effects by claiming they are uncertain, because NEPA requires some element of

predictive behavior. Sierra Club v. FERC, 867 F.3d 1357, 1374 (D.C. Cir. 2017) ("NEPA

analysis necessarily involves some 'reasonable forecasting,' and .. agencies may

sometimes need to make educated assumptions about an uncertain future.") (citation omitted).

49. NEPA compliance requires federal agencies to provide an opportunity for public

participation. See 40 C.F.R. § 1506.6 (the agency must "[m]ake diligent efforts to involve the

public" in preparing environmental documents, give "public notice of . the availability of

environmental documents so as to inform those persons . who may be interested or affected,"

and "[s]olicit appropriate information from the public").

50. The NEPA regulations also require an agency to supplement its analysis where

new information or circumstances result in significant environmental impacts not evaluated in

the prior documents. 40 C.F.R. § 1502.9., FAA Order 1050.1F, 9-3.

The Administrative Procedure Act

51. The APA provides for judicial review of agency actions such as those at issue

here pursuant to NEPA. A reviewing court shall "hold unlawful and set aside" any agency action

16

Case 1:23-cv-01204 Document 1 Filed 05/01/23 Page 18 of 32

found to be "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with

law," or that was promulgated "without observance of procedure required by law." 5 U.S.C. §

706(2)(A), (D).

52. The APA confers a right of judicial review on any person who is adversely

affected by agency action. 5 U.S.C. § 702. §

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

The Boca Chica Area

53. The SpaceX facility is surrounded by publicly owned conservation, park, and

recreation lands including Boca Chica State Park, Brazos Island State Park, the Lower Rio

Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge, the South Bay Coastal Preserve, and the Las Palomas

Wildlife Management Area (Boca Chica Unit). These conservation areas are home to some of

the country's most diverse wildlife communities, including wind tidal flats, mid-delta thorn

forest, and mid-valley riparian woodlands that support rare, threatened, and endangered species,

including imperiled migratory birds and sea turtles.

54. The Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge (LRGV) directly

adjacent to the Boca Chica launch siteis considered one of the most biologically diverse
regions in North America and it provides some of the most important habitat for migratory birds

in the U.S. During migration, bird species from the Central and Mississippi flyway converge on

this area, making it an essential stopover for migratory birds.

55. The Boca Chica tract of the Refuge is a particularly important link of the Lower

Rio Grande Valley Wildlife Corridor. It provides important habitat for migratory birds and is one

of the few places where the Kemp's Ridley sea turtle, the most critically endangered sea turtle in

the world, comes ashore to nest on refuge beaches in the spring and summer.

17

Case 1:23-cv-01204 Document 1 Filed 05/01/23 Page 19 of 32

56. The area surrounding the SpaceX launch site contains critically important and

sensitive habitat for many wildlife species, including the federally threatened piping plover. The
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has designated critical habitat for piping plovers that directly

overlaps with the Project site. Other federally protected species rely on the area as well,

including red knots, northern Aplomado falcons, Gulf Coast jaguarundi, ocelots, and Kemp's

Ridley, hawkbill, leatherback, loggerhead, and green sea turtles.

57. The Boca Chica area and its wildlife are sacred to the Carrizo/Comecrudo People.
Boca Chica is considered by the Tribe to be the actual birthing place of their first woman and is

therefore a central part of their creation story. Indeed, many of the Tribe's prayers and

ceremonies are connected to the Boca Chica area and its wildlife, such as the ocelot, which is a

sacred animal to the Tribe.

58. Boca Chica State Park and Beach is a popular public beach on an 8-mile stretch of

sand on the South Texas coast. The Beach is a significant coastal resource for the community to

enjoy surfing, fishing, wildlife viewing, beach walking, picnicking and other beachgoing

activities and coastal recreation. The Beach offers an open space site for residents of nearby

Brownsville and South Padre Island, as well as other residents and visitors to Cameron County

on the South Texas coast. The Beach provides the public with free wildlife-dependent recreation,

including wildlife observation, photography, fishing, environmental education, and

interpretation.

59. Other lands in the vicinity of the SpaceX facility that the FAA acknowledges

would be impacted by SpaceX activities likewise provide important habitat for wildlife,

including federally listed species. For example, the nearby Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife

Refuge provides habitat for the endangered ocelot, jaguarundi, and northern aplomado falcon as

18

Case 1:23-cv-01204 Document 1 Filed 05/01/23 Page 20 of 32

well as threatened and endangered sea turtles and shorebirds. It is also a premier bird-watching
destination with more recorded species of birds than any other refuge in the National Wildlife

Refuge System. The Refuge also provides habitat for the largest population in the United States

of ocelots, making it the center for conservation and recovery efforts for this endangered cat.

The Environmental Impacts of the SpaceX Launch Program

60. FAA issued a its Final PEA and Finding of no Significant Impact/Record of

Decision (FONSI/ROD) on June 13, 2022. The ROD approved SpaceX's plan to launch 20

Starship/Super Heavy rockets per year over the next 5 years, including suborbital launches and
orbital launches, along with tank tests, static fire engine tests, and construction of additional

launch related infrastructure.

61. The Super Heavy Rocket is the world's most powerful rocket. It holds up to 3,700
metric tons of liquid methane for propulsion, a potent greenhouse gas that would routinely be

vented into the atmosphere by SpaceX.

62. The operation of the SpaceX facility will harm wildlife through noise, heat, and

light pollution, including from the firing of booster rockets and intense lighting to support

ground operations. Noise and light associated with SpaceX operations can harm or harass listed

species, including piping plovers in their critical habitat, endangered ocelot and jaguarundi in
some of their last remaining habitat, and Kemp's Ridley sea turtles, the most critically

endangered sea turtle in the world. Light from the facility negatively affects nesting sea turtles

because it could cause adult females to false crawl or hatchlings to become disoriented and

reduce nesting success and hatchling survival. Endangered red knots and threatened piping

plovers could be killed if they are within the heat plume created by engine ignition during

19

Case 1:23-cv-01204 Document 1 Filed 05/01/23 Page 21 of 32

testing and launches, and noise disturbances displace plovers from their ESA-designated critical

habitat.

63. Since 2014, SpaceX has operated a rocket launch program at Boca Chica under a

prior permit from FAA which addressed only 12 launches per year. SpaceX has undertaken
many activities not covered by that permit, including a higher frequency of road closures

extending well beyond the allowed 180 hours, large explosions from "anomalies," the

appearance of significantly larger staffing than anticipated, as well as 24/7 operations, traffic,

and construction activities not addressed by the FAA.

64. Rocket launches and testing often result in explosions. The first launch of the
Starship/Super Heavy Rocket on April 20, 2023, ended in a fiery explosion of the rocket just

after liftoff. The rocket also destroyed the launch pad, spewing chunks of concrete and metal, as

well as ash and sand, over a large area, including adjacent tidal flats that provide habitat for

protected species such as piping plovers and other migratory birds.

65. There have been at least eight other rocket explosions at Boca Chica over the last

several years, including one in March of 2021 that spewed debris as far as five miles from the

launch site and took nearly three months to clean up. FAA acknowledges that several more
"anomalies" from tank tests and launches are expected to occur over the next five years. These
explosions spread debris across surrounding habitat and can cause brush/forest fires, putting

people and wildlife at great risk. FAA has accordingly acknowledged that an "anomaly"
represents the greatest risk to the environment from the SpaceX activities at Boca Chica.

66. There have been several fires attributable to SpaceX anomalies. For example, two
SpaceX incidents on July 25, 2019, and again in August 2019 resulted in wildfires of 150-acres

and 11-acres, respectively, burning coastal prairie and dune habitats on National Wildlife Refuge

20

Case 1:23-cv-01204 Document 1 Filed 05/01/23 Page 22 of 32

managed land. Explosions in November 2019, February 2020, and December 2020 likewise

scattered debris onto Refuge managed lands. Another 68 acres of Refuge were burned in

September of 2022, when a rocket a exploded during a static fire test.

67. Operations to retrieve the debris have further damaged the Refuge. According to

FWS, falling debris has damaged sensitive wind-tidal flats and debris retrieval methods damaged
the sensitive alkaline flat and refuge cable fencing installed to protect the area from disturbance.
The vehicles or machinery used to retrieve debris have created rutting and damage that interrupts

tidal water sheet flow across these flats.

68. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has found that SpaceX's operations have

significantly diminished its ability to maintain the biological integrity, diversity, and

environmental health of Refuge resources at the Boca Chica tract. These activities have

prevented or constrained public access year-round, hampered biological and monitoring studies

including sea turtle patrols, interfered with refuge management and law enforcement patrol,

increased road mortality of wildlife at all hours of daytime and nighttime, damaged sensitive

habitats such as the wind tidal flats and the salt prairie from explosions and fires, and adversely

impacted nesting habitat for sensitive species.

69. The SpaceX launch program has also increased vehicle traffic causing mortality

of wildlife, with carcasses of snowy plover, common nighthawk, Harris's hawk, rose-breasted

grosbeak, and eastern meadowlark found over the past two years-all species designated as
Birds of Conservation Concern by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

70. The increased traffic also exposes jaguarundis and ocelots to collisions.

According to the FAA, there will be an extra 505 vehicles per day from the FAA-permitted

activities moving through potential travel corridors for the Gulf Coast jaguarundi and ocelot. The

21

Case 1:23-cv-01204 Document 1 Filed 05/01/23 Page 23 of 32

project will harm those species by increased collisions and/or by displacing them and causing

them to expend additional energy in seeking alternative north-south travel corridors.

71. The FAA itself acknowledges that the construction and operation of the project

would result in adverse impacts from noise, light, traffic, heat and debris from rockets (that can

explode and cause wildfires), and is therefore likely to adversely affect several protected species,

including piping plovers, red knots, northern aplomado falcons, gulf coast jaguarundi and

ocelots, as well as Kemp's Ridley, loggerhead, green, hawksbill, and leatherback sea turtles.
Furthermore, the PEA acknowledges the potential for significant environmental harm from
SpaceX activities due to the unique and/or unknown risks of rocket launches (including

"anomalies").

72. The frequent Beach closures with little or no public notice also cause a large
impact on the community. In 2021, Boca Chica Beach was closed or inaccessible for

approximately 500 hours or more, based on the notices of closure provided by Cameron County,

with a Beach or access point closure occurring on over 100 separate days.

73. SpaceX activities restrict the ability of the public to access and enjoy the Texas

coastline adjacent to the project site, including Boca Chica State Park and Beach, a popular

public beach on an 8-mile stretch of sand near the city of Brownsville, Texas. Beach access is

guaranteed by local, state, and federal law. This loss of access disproportionately
impacts environmental justice communities and infringes upon the ability of the

Carrizo/Comecrudo Nation of Texas to access lands and waters that are part of their ancestral

heritage.

FAA's Review of the SpaceX Launch Program

22

Case 1:23-cv-01204 Document 1 Filed 05/01/23 Page 24 of 32

74. The Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984 authorizes the Secretary of

Transportation to regulate commercial launch and reentry activities within the United States. See

51 U.S.C. §§ 50901-50923. The Secretary has delegated that authority to the FAA Administrator.
See 49 CFR § 1.83(b).

75. In 2014, the FAA prepared an EIS and issued a permit to SpaceX to launch so-

called Falcon vehicles at the Boca Chica site. Since then, SpaceX has applied to FAA for a new

permit to use the Boca Chica Launch Site for the Starship/Super Heavy program. The project
includes associated tank tests, static fire engine tests, expansion of the vertical launch area and

construction of additional infrastructure.

76. In June of 2020, the FAA's Chief of Staff for the Office of Commercial Space

Transportation stated in an email that the agency planned to conduct a new EIS for the

Starship/Super Heavy program. However, the FAA subsequently deferred to SpaceX and only

analyzed the Starship/Super Heavy program through an EA that was prepared by SpaceX under

the supervision of the FAA.

77. The FAA released a draft PEA on the project for public review on September 17,

2021.

78. The FAA received many comments on the draft PEA from Plaintiffs and others-

including local and national organizations-discussing the significant environmental and

community impacts of the SpaceX launch program at Boca Chica and setting forth concerns

about the FAA's failure to adequately analyze those impacts and to require mitigation to protect

the environment, including vital wildlife habitat, from undue harm.

79. The FAA issued a its Final PEA and Finding of no Significant Impact/Record of

Decision (FONSI/ROD) on June 13, 2022. The FONSI/ROD states that FAA finds the action to

23

Case 1:23-cv-01204 Document 1 Filed 05/01/23 Page 25 of 32

be consistent with NEPA, and therefore it "directs that action be taken, together with the
necessary related and collateral actions, to carry out the agency decisions as detailed in this
Mitigated FONSI/ROD, including: A determination under 14 CFR Part 450 as to SpaceX's
application for a vehicle operator license.'

80. In deciding whether to prepare an EIS, the FAA has a duty to take a hard look at

whether the proposed activities will significantly affect the environment. Yet the FAA failed to

take the requisite hard look at the proposed project and has concluded that significant adverse

effects will not occur due to purported mitigation measures.

81. In refusing to prepare an EIS, the FAA failed to consider and ensure adequate
mitigation for the full range of impacts associated with the proposed action, including impacts to
the wildlife refuge lands and protected wildlife, energy use and contribution to climate impacts,

impacts on migration patterns for impacted species, and community impacts due to frequent

beach closures.

82. While the PEA a contains a list of around 70 purported "mitigation measures," the

proposed measures are inadequate to address the extensive environmental impacts of SpaceX's

activities. Many of the measures are not actually mitigation imposed specifically by FAA, but are

actions required under other laws, such as stormwater permitting under the Clean Water Act.

Other measures are meaningless as a practical matter, such as a requirement to turn off lighting

that adversely affects wildlife when the lighting is not needed, since the PEA makes clear that

such lighting will likely be required nearly 24/7.

83. The PEA does not include mitigation measures to address impacts to sensitive

wildlife such as the restoration and enhancement of ocelot or plover habitat affected by the noise,

heat, and light from rocket launches, as well as the adverse impacts of "anomalies." The PEA

24

Case 1:23-cv-01204 Document 1 Filed 05/01/23 Page 26 of 32

provides no mitigation to address the direct impacts of explosions and resulting fires, and only

provides for uncertain after-the-fact mitigation-i.e., consultation with other agencies to discuss

debris removal which does nothing to address the extensive direct damage that may occur from

explosions and fires.

84. The FAA never explained anywhere in the PEA/FONSI/ROD how the proposed

mitigation could or would reduce the anticipated environmental impacts to such a degree that

they would not be considered "significant" for purposes of NEPA and thereby require an EIS.

85. The PEA considered only two alternatives, including the preferred alternative and

a "no action" alternative. The FAA failed to analyze other options, including a less-intensive use

of the Boca Chica site (i.e., fewer launches per year), or the use of other sites for the proposed

launches, such as the Kennedy Space Center, which SpaceX itself has suggested as an

alternative.

86. The FAA provided no analysis in the PEA as to the impacts the proposed project
would have on the climateincluding through the burning and venting of liquid methane, a

potent greenhouse gas-and how that will impact people and the environment. The FAA simply

claimed that the emissions will not be significant, based only on comparing SpaceX to the total

GHG emissions of the US. The FAA thereby ignored that every contribution of GHGs to the

atmosphere causes cumulative harm, and that NEPA requires a consideration of climate impacts.

87. The PEA does not provide a full analysis of the environmental impacts to the

publicly owned conservation, park, and recreation lands that are of inestimable conservation

value for a range of federally and state listed species and other protected species such as

migratory birds. Rather, the PEA provides only cursory statements about the potential for

environmental harm - including passing reference to potentially catastrophic harm from rocket

25

Case 1:23-cv-01204 Document 1 Filed 05/01/23 Page 27 of 32

explosions that may cause extensive wildfires - but fails to provide any real analysis of the actual

impacts to the people, habitats and wildlife that will be adversely affected.

88. The PEA acknowledges that FAA anticipates er "anomalies" from the

Starship/Super Heavy program, which will cause explosions and the spread of debris. The blast
danger area for the debris spread includes the adjacent wildlife refuge and park lands, though the

analysis was limited to a 700-acre debris study area, and the rocket explosion/launch pad

destruction on April 20 indicates that debris was not limited to that area. Regardless, the PEA

provides no analysis of what the actual environmental impacts of these explosions could be on

nearby wildlife and habitats just conclusory statements about the potential for some unknown

amount of harm.

89. The FAA also failed to address the harm to wildlife and habitats from debris

recovery efforts, which have caused undue adverse impacts to wildlife, including listed species.

The PEA suggests future debris recovery would be done on foot, rather than using vehicles, but

fails to address the potential for harm from having debris removed in that manner, such as

increased human presence and the trails that would be created through the sensitive tidal flats.

90. The FAA also failed to address the potential for hazardous material contamination

from "anomalies" and storms. Launch propellant and commodities (including gaseous and liquid

methane) will be stored in aboveground tanks at the Boca Chica site. This includes thousands of

metric tons of propellants, which by definition are explosive, and have been shown to be

carcinogenic and toxic. The Boca Chica site may be hit by hurricanes coming off the Gulf of

Mexico, which have been increasing in recent years. The Federal Emergency Management

Agency's flood risk map shows that all SpaceX facilities at Boca Chica are at risk of flooding.

The FAA failed, however, to consider the potential impacts of storm damage, including a worst-

26

Case 1:23-cv-01204 Document 1 Filed 05/01/23 Page 28 of 32

case scenario tank rupture, and the harm that would result in the habitat areas surrounding the

SpaceX site.

91. FAA failed to adequately analyze the impacts of noise and light pollution on

wildlife, and in fact it could not do SO because the FAA acknowledged that detailed information

about some of the proposed launch-related infrastructure (e.g., exact location and design) was not
made available for review. FAA also failed to require sufficient mitigation for noise and light

pollution, such as season/time lighting restrictions during the crucial hatching season for sea

turtles. Rather, FAA acknowledged that harmful white lights may need to be used continually for

several days.

92. FAA failed to consider and analyze the impacts to the surrounding community

from the closures that would be necessary to accommodate construction and launch activities.

The only coastal access to Boca Chica Beach is Texas State Highway 4-locally known as Boca

Chica Boulevardwhich would be closed up to 500 hours per year to accommodate SpaceX

construction and launch activities, with additional closures to respond to anomalies. These

closures have a significant impact on the local community, including the cultural, social, and

spiritual interests of the Carrizo/Comecrudo Nation of Texas, which the FAA failed entirely to

address in the PEA.

93. On April 14, 2023, the FAA issued a Commercial Space Transportation License

to SpaceX, which allows the company to launch the first flight of the Starship-Super Heavy

vehicle from Boca Chica, Texas, as well as to undertake pre-flight ground operations, such as
tank testing and static fire 5 tests, over the next 5 years. Despite the recent explosion of the rocket

and launch pad during its first launch on April 20, 2023, SpaceX has stated its intent to move

forward with additional launches in the next few months.

27

Case 1:23-cv-01204 Document 1 Filed 05/01/23 Page 29 of 32

94. The FAA included with the License a Written Re-evaluation of the Final PEA for

the SpaceX Starship/Super Heavy Launch Vehicle Program, which provided an analysis of new

information regarding the use of deluge water and launch vehicle ocean landings, including

information which was not considered in the PEA and never subject to public review and
comment. The Written Re-evaluation is intended to consider whether a supplemental EA is

warranted; however, it does not re-evaluate the environmental impacts discussed in the PEA and

thus does not cure any of the failures identified herein regarding FAA's violations of NEPA.

FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF

The FAA violated the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321 et seq.,
applicable regulations, and the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706

95. Plaintiffs reallege, as if fully set forth herein, each and every allegation contained
in the preceding paragraphs.

96. The FAA's authorization of the Starship/Super Heavy Launch Vehicle Program at

Boca Chica, Texas is a major federal action that requires compliance with NEPA. See 42 U.S.C.

§ 4332(2)(C). The FAA determined in the FONSI/ROD that the SpaceX Starship/Super Heavy
Launch Vehicle Program was consistent with NEPA without the need for an EIS, and further

stated that the agency was making an affirmative decision to approve SpaceX's application for a

vehicle operator license and to allow the activities as detailed in the FONSI/ROD, which include

20 launches over the next 5 years as well as ground operations such as tank and static fire tests

(which also may result in explosions and otherwise cause environmental harm).

97. The FAA issued the PEA and FONSI/ROD even though the action will have

significant adverse environmental impacts, requiring the preparation of an EIS. Indeed, the

FAA's Chief of Staff for the Office of Commercial Space Transportation acknowledged that a

new EIS was warranted for the Starship/Super Heavy Launch Vehicle Program, but the agency

28

Case 1:23-cv-01204 Document 1 Filed 05/01/23 Page 30 of 32

subsequently allowed SpaceX to conduct an EA rather than an EIS, thereby unlawfully

delegating this important determination under NEPA to the self-interested applicant.

98. The mitigation measures set forth in the PEA are inadequate to compensate
for the significant adverse impacts that SpaceX launch program will cause. The Boca Chica

area provides some of the most important habitat in the U.S., yet FAA failed to require

meaningful measures to protect the species that rely on the surrounding habitat.

99. The FAA violated NEPA by failing to take the requisite hard look at the

significant environmental effects of the project. See, e.g., 40 C.F.R. §§ 1502.1, 1502.16(a), (b),

1501.9(e). Among other things, the FAA failed to adequately analyze the project's contribution

to climate change; the impacts of beach closures on the community, including on environmental
justice communities and the Carrizo/Comecrudo Nation of Texas; the impacts of "anomalies"

including the potential for highly destructive wildfires; and the impacts to wildlife from

increased traffic, lighting, and the noise and heat associated with rocket launches.

100. The FAA failed to consider an adequate range of alternatives, as NEPA requires,

including an alternative with fewer launches per year to mitigate the impacts of the launch

program by reducing harm from noise, heat, lighting, and closures of public lands directly related
to launch activities, and an alternative launch site altogether.
101. Furthermore, the FAA's FONSI/ROD for the launch program was arbitrary and
capricious since the agency failed to set forth a reasonable basis for concluding that the impacts

of the launch program can and will be mitigated such that they would no longer be considered

"significant" under NEPA. The environmental impacts associated with the SpaceX launch

program are undoubtedly "significant," even with the proposed mitigation--particularly from

ongoing "anomalies"-and thus by preparing an EA/FONSI rather than an EIS for its issuance of

29

Case 1:23-cv-01204 Document 1 Filed 05/01/23 Page 31 of 32

a permit for the SpaceX launch program, the FAA violated NEPA, 42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C), and

its implementing regulations.

102. The FAA has not announced that it will undertake any further review pursuant to

NEPA in light of the April 20 failed launch. Failure to supplement the prior analysis to take the

requisite hard look at the human health and environmental impacts of the failed April 20

launch-including the destruction of the launch pad and resulting chunks of concrete being

ejected into adjacent tidal flat habitat, as well as the spread of debris, including ash that may pose

significant health risks-is a clear violation of NEPA and the APA. See 40 C.F.R. § 1502.9; 5

U.S.C. § 706(1). This explosion further undermines the FAA's "finding of no significant

impact," and reinforces the need for an EIS for the Starship/Super Heavy Launch Program.

103. For the reasons set forth above, the FAA's decision to approve SpaceX's

application for a vehicle operator license for the Starship/Super Heavy Launch Vehicle Program

violates NEPA and is arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in

accordance with law, and contrary to the APA. See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court:

a) Declare that the FAA's PEA/FONSI/ROD for the Starship/Super Heavy Launch Vehicle
Program violate NEPA and applicable regulations;

b) Vacate and remand the FAA's decision to approve SpaceX's application for a vehicle

operator license for compliance with NEPA and applicable regulations; and

c) Award Plaintiffs their costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees under applicable law; and

d) Provide for such other relief as the Court deems just and appropriate.
