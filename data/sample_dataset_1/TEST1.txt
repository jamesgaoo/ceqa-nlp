8 14. All medical waste generators, including small quantity generators, within the County
9 of Orange must register with, seek approval from, or maintain certain documentation and records
10 with the County of Orange, Health Care Agency, Environmental Health ("HCA") pursuant to the
11 Medical Waste Management Act. (Health & Saf. Code, §§ 117820, 117904, 117945.) The HCA

22 generated sharps. (Health & Saf. Code, §117690(a).)
23 /l
24 Il

25

26 2 Petitioners are willing to waive the venue provision contained in Health & Safety Code
27 section 118325, which allows such cause of action to be filed in the county where a violation of the California Medical Waste Act has occurred or is about to occur, in the interest of having all claims
28 decided at the same time. In the alternative, Petitioners are willing to stipulate to a change of a venue to Orange County for all causes of action.

FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT

- 18.

2

3 A "small quantity generator" means "a medical waste generator, other than a trauma

4 scene waste management practitioner, that generates less than 200 pounds per month of medical
I waste." (Health & Saf. Code, § 117760.)
19. OCNEP's needle exchange program activities, including the disposal of used
5 syringes and sharps waste from is program participants, are subject to regulation under the Medical
6 Waste Management Act.
7

8 Clean Needle and Syringe Exchange Programs
20. Health and Safety Code section 121349(c) provides that CDPH may authorize an
9 entity that provides certain services (including drug abuse treatment services, Human
10 Immunodeficiency Virus ["HIV"] or hepatitis screening, Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B vaccination,
11

12
OFFICE OETTE CP R  CI O N S E 13 etc.) to provide upon application to CDPH hypodermic needle and syringe exchange services

14 consistent with state standards in certain locations as determined by CDPH. This is commonly

15 known as a "Clean Needle and Syringe Exchange Program." Subdivision (c) of Health and Safety

16 Code section 121349 also requires CDPH to consult with the local health officer and local law

17 enforcement leadership and balance the concerns of law enforcement with the public health
benefits prior to issuing the authorization.
21.

18 Health and Safety Code section 121349(d) requires that, in order for CDPH to issue
the authorization, the application must demonstrate that the applicant comply with certain
19 minimum standards. These minimum standards include establishing that the entity can provide
20 certain services, including drug abuse treatment, HIV/hepatitis screening, Hepatitis A and B
21

22

23 vaccination, screening for sexually transmitted infections, etc., that the entity has the capacity to
commence needle and syringe exchange services within three months of authorization; that the
entity has adequate funding to provide needle and syringe exchange services for all of its
24 participants, to provide HIV and viral hepatitis prevention education service for all of its
25

26

27 participants and to provide for the safe recovery and disposal of used syringes and sharps waste

28 from all of its participants; and that the entity has the capacity, and established plan, to collect
evaluative data in order to assess program impact, including total number of persons served, total
number of syringes and needles distributed, recovered and disposed of, and total numbers and

L

2 types of referrals to drug treatment and other services. (Health
22. & Saf. Code, § 121349(d).)

3 CDPH has also issued rules and regulations regarding the authorization of the

4 hypodermic needle and syringe exchange services. (See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 17, § 7000 et seq.)
As it relates to the application, title 17, section 7002(a), of the Code of Regulations sets forth the
5 requirements for the application, which include, but are not limited to, a description of services,
6 anticipated number of participants to be served each year, estimated number of syringes to be
7

8 dispensed and collected each year, a copy of various plans that must meet certain regulatory criteria
and that guide the operation of the Clean Needle and Syringe Exchange Program as well as
9 collection and dispensing of needles, and a signed statement attesting to various criteria, including
10

11 compliance with law and capacity to begin syringe exchange services within 90 days.
23.

FFICECOLNEENGESEL 12

13 In addition, title 17, section 7004, of the Code of Regulations imposes a mandatory

14 and non-discretionary duty upon CDPH, requiring it to reject an application if any of the following
deficiencies exist:

a.

15 b. Information submitted in the application is incorrect or incomplete;

16 The applicant does not meet all the requirements listed in Health and Safety

17 Code section 121349;

C.

18

19 Evidence of project harm to public safety, presented by local law enforcement

20 official(s), is, in the department's judgment, greater than evidence of projected

24. benefits to public health.

21 Finally, title 17, section 7002(c) of the Code of Regulations also imposes a

22

23 mandatory and non-discretionary duty upon CDPH, requiring it to reject an application unless it,
among other requirements, "[p]rovides for the safe recovery and disposal of used syringes and
sharps waste from all its participants."
24 The Needle Exchange Program in Santa Ana
25 25.

26 OCNEP became the first needle exchange program in Orange County when it was

27 approved for operation in the City of Santa Ana by CDPH in 2016. Citing public health risks, the

28 City of Santa Ana terminated the Memorandum of Understanding between the City of Santa Ana
and OCNEP, after allowing the program to operate in the Santa Ana Civic Center from February
8
FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT

-

2 2016 to January 2018. This was primarily due to various public health threats posed by a sharp

3 increase in discarded syringes in the Santa Ana Civic Center.
26.

4 During the time period that OCNEP operated in the Santa Ana, Civic Center, Santa

5 Ana Public Library staff reported finding as many as 40 to 50 discarded syringes on the property

6 per month, including on shelves, near players, window sills, and even inside books, posing a threat

7 to patrons. City of Santa Ana employees were also pricked by discarded needles, which littered

8 parks and sidewalks. Prior to that time, Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereon allege,
that staff rarely found syringes in the facility.
9 27.

10 During the Environmental Remediation Project along the Santa Ana River Trail in

11 2018, approximately 14,000 dirty needles were removed from a less than four-mile stretch in a

12 two-week period. Outreach and Engagement ("O&E"), a program under Orange County Health

CUIDNVHO 40 ALNNO: OFFICE OF THE COUNTY COUNS 13 Care Agency's umbrella, provided services to the population encamped in the Santa Ana River

14 Trail area, Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that approximately 14,000

15 needles collected from the Santa Ana River Trail area included needles distributed by OCNEP.

16 Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that individuals known as "gatekeepers"

17 would collect all the dirty needles they could find from the Santa Ana River Trail and bring them

18 to the OCNEP in the City of Santa Ana. These "gatekeepers" would be given replacement needles

19 at the OCNEP, plus an additional 20. The gatekeepers would then bring the clean needles to the

20 Santa Ana River Trail area and distribute them among the population living there.
28.

21 The over 14,000 needles collected from the Santa Ana Riverbed were not secured in

22 any type of safe syringe collection boxes, although such boxes had been provided. On numerous

23 occasions, Orange County Public Works staff would find the syringe collection boxes damaged,
opened and/or missing. In an effort to stop the theft/damage of the collection boxes, Orange
24 County Public Works staff replaced the plastic boxes with upgraded steel collection boxes.
25 Despite these efforts, these upgraded steel boxes were still stolen and broken into on a regular
26 basis.

27 29.

28 Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that, while in operation,
OCNEP was disposing of approximately 20,000 needles per week.
9
FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT

30.

2 Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that OCNEP plans to

3 distribute syringes on a one-for-one plus 20 basis, dramatically increasing the number of syringes

4 in Orange County and making it a needle "giveaway" versus an "exchange."
31. Using the one-for-one plus 20 rate of needle exchange, the collection of 20,000
5 needles per week will equate to 420,000 needles released into the community per week.
6 32.

7 During the time period that OCNEP operated in Santa Ana, Civic Center, OCNEP

8 did not register as a small quantity generator of medical waste. OCNEP did not obtain HCA's
approval to operate a home-generated sharps consolidation point. OCNEP also did not maintain
9 the required documents in accordance with the Medical Waste Management Act.
10 OCNEP's Application

11 33.
OFFICE OE THE CO UNTK, COUNSEL After being denied a local permit by the City of Santa Ana, in March 2018, OCNEP
12 applied to the CDPH for a certification to provide mobile clean needle and syringe exchange
13

14 program and services during certain hours and certain areas located in the City of Anaheim, City of

15 Costa Mesa, City of Orange, and City of Santa Ana in County of Orange. A true and correct copy

16 of OCNEP's Application is attached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated herein by reference as if
set forth fully herein.

18 Upon deeming the application provisionally appropriate and as required by Californial

19 Health and Safety Code Section 121349(e), CDPH opened ninety-day public comment period,
which ended on June 25, 2018. During the public comment period, many public and law
20 enforcement officials of the County of Orange and cities located within the County submitted
21 numerous letters and resolutions, voicing concerns about and registering their opposition to the
22 proposed OCNEP application. These letters and resolutions listed and highlighted certain facts and
23

24 numerous concerns regarding the potential public safety and health effects of the applicant's

25 operation. These concerns were largely based on OCNEP's operation of the stationary clean

26 needle and syringe exchange program in the City of Santa Ana Civic Center from February 2016 to

27 January 2018. These concerns were directly related to the very operation and design of the mobile

28 clean needle and syringe exchange program applied for by OCNEP and as stated in the statutory
and regulatory scheme of the clean needle and syringe exchange program.

2 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION FOR VIOLATION OF THE MEDICAL WASTE
MANAGEMENT ACT
3 (By Plaintiff and Petitioner
4 County of Orange

5 40. Against Defendant and Respondent OCNEP Only)
Petitioners incorporate by reference all the allegations contained in the preceding
6 paragraphs as though fully set forth herein
7 41.

8 OCNEP's proposed needle exchange program activities qualify OCNEP as a medical

9 waste generator, a small quantity generator, and a home-generated sharps consolidation point.
42. Although OCNEP previously operated its needle exchange program in Santa Ana,
10 OCNEP has not registered with HCA or paid applicable fees as a small-quantity generator of
11

12 medical waste. OCNEP also has not obtained HCA's approval to operate any locations as a point

ISADIONVãO 4O ALNNOO. . OFFICE OF THE COUNTY COUNSEL 13 of consolidation for the collection of home-generated sharps waste. OCNEP has also not

14 maintained necessary documents as a medical waste generator.
43. Therefore, pursuant to Section 118325 of the Health and Safety Code, the County of
15 Orange seeks a preliminary and permanent injunction to enjoin OCNEP's violation and threatened
16 violation of the Medical Waste Management Act.
17

18 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION FOR PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
(CCP § 1085)

19

20 (Against State Respondents Only)
44.

21 Petitioners incorporate by reference all the allegations contained in the preceding
paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.
22 45.

23 Title 17, section 7004, of the Code of Regulations requires CDPH to reject an

24 application if, among other things, information submitted in the application is incorrect or

25 incomplete, or if the applicant does not meet the requirements listed in Health and Safety Code
section 121349.

26 46.

27 OCNEP's application to CDPH contained incorrect and incomplete information in
several areas, including but not limited to days and hours of operation and neighborhood or
28 homeowner association information.
12
FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT

47. Moreover, OCNEP's application failed to meet requirements set forth in Health and
2 Safety Code section 121349 et seq. Specifically, OCNEP's application was entirely devoid of any
concern that 3 evidence or information as to how it would improve its operation and eliminate any
4 the threats to public health and safety that occurred within the City of Santa Ana, Civic Center,
5 would not occur with the new certification to operate the mobile program. Further, despite having
6 the information surrounding OCNEP's operation in the City of Santa Ana, Civic Center, CDPH
7 failed to consider it in authorizing OCNEP to operate the needle exchange program.
8 48. All of the evidence submitted to CDPH relating to public health and safety concerns
9 about OCNEP operation in the City of Santa Ana, Civic Center demonstrate that the harm to public
10 safety exceeds any public health benefit of OCNEP's operation of four mobile dispensaries
11 covering a far greater area than their prior operation.
12 49. Further, title 17, section 7002(c) of the Code of Regulations also imposes a TESNNOONYANO HNO SOILLI0 13 mandatory and non-discretionary duty upon CDPH, requiring it to reject an application unless it,
14 among other requirements, "[p]rovides for the safe recovery and disposal of used syringes and
15 sharps waste from all its participants."
16 50. OCNEP's application failed to provide for the safe recovery and disposal of used
17 syringes and sharps waste from all its participants. Indeed, CDPH's August 6, 2018 authorization
18 letter tacitly admits that this is an issue requiring further attention, by noting OCNEP's agreement
19 to "work with" the County and its municipalities to increase sharps disposal options and "address
20 ongoing syringe litter collection issues." On its face, OCNEP's willingness to entertain a
21 continuing dialogue with the County at some unknown time in the future falls far short of
22 providing for the safe recovery and disposal of used syringes and sharps waste from all its
23 I participants.
24 51. Further, the mere fact that the planned program allows for the recovery of up to 21
25 clean needles for 1 dirty needle, capped at 200 needles per user per day and thereby allowing for
26 the exponential increase in distribution of needles throughout the County, provides no method of
27 safe recovery, disposal, or even accountability for the needles distributed to the public at large.
28 /l
13
FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT

52. State Respondents therefore had a non-discretionary and mandatory duty to reject
2 OCNEP's application, and their failure to comply with their duties under the law has resulted in the
3 authorization of OCNEP's operation of the needle exchange program, posing an immediate threat
4

5 to the public health and safety of the citizens of Orange County.
53.

6 Petitioners have no plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.

7 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

8 54. (Against All Defendants and Respondents)
Petitioners incorporate by reference all the allegations contained in the preceding
9 paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.
10 55.

11 An actual controversy exists between the parties. Petitioners contend that State

12 Respondents have authorized OCNEP to operate a needle exchange program without meeting the
OFFICE OE THE OO NTIKI C OUNSEL necessary legal requirements.
13 56.

14 Based upon the a foregoing, a clear, actual and present controversy has arisen between
Petitioners, State Respondents and OCNEP, which controversy cannot be resolved without a
15 judicial determination.
16 57.

17 Accordingly, Petitioners seek a judicial determination of the respective rights, duties
and obligations of the parties.
18

19 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION FOR PUBLIC NUISANCE

20 58. (Against All Defendants and Respondents)

21 Petitioners incorporate by reference all the allegations contained in the preceding
paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.

22 59.

23 The operation of the needle exchange program by an entity that does not meet the

24 aforementioned legal requirements is injurious to the public health and safety of residents of
Orange County in violation of Civil Code sections 3479 and 3480.
25 60.

26 61. Petitioners have exhausted their administrative remedies where required to do so.

27 Unless and until the nuisance created by Defendants and Respondents is enjoined, the

28 safety, health and well-being of the public will suffer irreparable damage. Defendants and
//
14
FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT

1

3 Respondents must be compelled to perform the acts requested in the prayer for relief, below and
2 incorporated by reference, as the Petitioners have no other adequate remedy at law.

4 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION FOR VIOLATION OF CEQA

5 62. (Against State Respondents Only)

7 Petitioners incorporate by reference all the allegations contained in the preceding
6 paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.
63.

8

9 Petitioners are informed and believe that State Respondents have violated CEQA

10 (Public Resources Code §§ 21000, et seq.) and have failed to proceed in the manner required by
law, committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and acted arbitrarily and capriciously in

11

12 authorizing the OCNEP application because the discretionary approval by CDPH of the application

OFFICE OF THE COUNTY COUNSEL was not subjected to any environmental review as required by CEQA.
64.

Y OF ORANGE 13

14 As the Authorization Letter from the California Department of Public Health dated

15 August 6, 2018 states, the OCNEP has resulted in syringe litter, which creates environmental

16 impacts to public health and safety that have not been addressed through CEQA environmental

17 review. Such impacts include, but are not limited to, used syringes being littered near schools
where children walk, along recreational trails utilized by families, in parks utilized by families, in

19 libraries frequented by children, in restrooms, in parking lots and garages, and in other public
18 buildings and public places, along public rights-of-way, loose in trash, and within conduits of water

21 which result in syringes being found in creeks, streams, rivers, and outlets to the ocean, including
20 beaches near those outlets. These impacts result in exposure of innocent persons, including

22 children, to experiencing a needle stick which could result in

23 the contracting of communicable

24 diseases such as Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, or HIV. The syringe litter also results in potential

25 adverse impacts to the recreational use of public facilities and to water quality in the creeks,

26 streams, rivers and beaches of the County of Orange. These impacts have not been analyzed by
Respondents as required by CEQA.
65.

28 Notice of the County's intention to file this Petition and Complaint was served on the
State Respondents on August 3, 2018. Notices of the intention of the cities of Costa Mesa, Orange

ORANGE COUNTY NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAM
APPLICATION FOR CERTIFICATION AS A MOBILE SYRINGE EXCHANGE

The Orange County Needle Exchange Program (OCNEP) is currently certified by the California

III. Applicant Organization Description (please briefly describe the organization's mission
and core services)

OCNEP is 501(c)(3) tax-exempt, California nonprofit corporation. We are a volunteer-run,
needle exchange program located in Orange County, grounded in harm reduction and evidence-
based principles. Our core mission is to prevent HIV, hepatitis C, and other infectious discases
by safely disposing of used syringes and providing sterile injection and safer sex supplies. Over the last two years, we have served tens of thousands of clients and exchanged well over a million

syringes. We provide non-judgmental education on issues faced by people who inject drugs, and referrals to HIV and hepatitis C testing on request.
IV. Description and Summary of Proposed SEP

Program Service Delivery Mode (check one): Mobile Site
Estimated Annual Number of Clients to be Served: ~10,000

Estimated Annual Number of Syringes Dispensed & Collected ~1,000,000

SEP Locations, Days and Hours of Operation:
OCNEP will operate a mobile exchange throughout Orange County. Orange County has an enormous and almost entirely uncared-for population of people who inject drugs. Further, Orange County's homeless population is frequently forcibly relocated, requiring rapid relocation changes to serve the public health need. Consequently, OCNEP has a need to become a mobile needle exchange program. Currently, the organization does not have the resources to expand throughout the entire county, but it could feasibly staff mobile exchange operations in Santa Ana, Orange, and Anaheim on a weekly basis, and one exchange day a month in Costa Mesa. OCNEP is requesting to be certified in the following several block areas within each city:
Santa Ana: Area bounded by (N) East 4th Street, (E) North Standard Ave, (S) South Grand Avenue, and (W) East Chesnut Avenue.

Orange:
Area bounded by (N) West Katella Ave / West Struck Avenue, (E) Main Street, (S) West Orangewood Avenue, (W) Santa Ana River

Anaheim:
Area bounded by (N) Riverside Freeway, (E) North Olive Street, (S) East La Palma Avenue, (W) North Anaheim Boulevard

Costa Mesa: Area bounded by (N) West 18th Street, (E) Monrovia Avenue, (S) West 16th outer border of Armstrong Petroleum Corporation Street, (W) The

We would like to be certified to operate daily between the hours of 10 AM and 5 PM. This broad time range will allow us-to be flexible in serving the needs of clients who may need us to adjust hours so they can access services as their situations change. The time range also allows us to expand to new locations and adjust hours around daylight savings. Our plan is to operate in
2

Santa Ana on Saturdays from 1-3pm, in Orange on Sundays from 1-3pm, and in Anaheim on Wednesdays from 12-2pm, and every first Friday in Costa Mesa from 1-3pm, although this could change depending on our negotiations with each of the cities . While these would be our officially posted hours, we require a permit with a longer time frame to allow us to serve latecomers and so we would continue to operate until clients arc no longer present. At our current location, we regularly have a line with 20 to 40 people at our closing time.
For each of the SEP locations above, please provide the contact name, phone number, and e- mail for the neighborhood association of the location (ifone exists):

OCNEP is volunteer-run and has been operating effectively under that staffing model for over two years. At each mobile site, a minimum of three volunteers will be present to manage daily program. There will be a minimum of one volunteer for each of the following tasks: intake, distribution, and referral. When possible, we will have additional volunteers on staff (maximum number to be determined) to increase operational speed and efficiency.

Please provide a short summary paragraph that will be posted on the California Department of Public Health, Office of AIDS website, which summarizes the proposed program and includes the name of the applicant organization, the name of the SEP (if different), the location(s), hours and days of service, and types of services to be delivered (not to exceed 150 words):
The Orange County Needle Exchange Program (OCNEP) is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt, Califomia nonprofit corporation that promotes public health and safety. The core mission of OCNEP is to prevent the transmission of HIV, hepatitis C, and other infectious diseases by providing access to sterile needles, facilitating the disposal of used syringes, and providing access to safer injection and safer sex supplies. Additionally, OCNEP empowers community members by providing them with healthcare referrals, health education, STD testing and vaccination referrals, substance abuse treatment, homelessness support, and research in line with best practice models. Our mobile program will operate in several locations in Orange County throughout the week in an effort to offer multiple days in which to dispose of used syringes, in exchange for sterile syringes. Currently our program disposes of over 20,000 used syringes per week, and we seek to expand our operations to help additional regions in the county. OCNEP seeks authorization to provide syringe exchange services at the following times and locations:
Santa Ana: Daily, 10am-5pm Area bounded by (N) East 4th Street, (E) North Standard Ave, (S) South Grand Avenue, and (W) East Chesnut Avenue.

Orange: Daily, 10am-5pm Area bounded by (N) West Katella Ave / West Struck Avenue, (E) Main Street, (S) West Orangewood Avenue, (W) Santa Ana River
Anaheim: Daily, 10am-5pm Area bounded by (N) Riverside Freeway, (E) North Olive Street, (S) East La Palma Avenue, (W) North Anaheim Boulevard

Costa Mesa: Daily, 10am-5pm Area bounded by (N) West 18th Street, (E) Monrovia Avenue, (S) West 16th Street, (W) The outer border of Armstrong Petroleum

V. Needs Statement
Please provide the rationale for the request for Certification in the location(s) specified and use data and other objective sources to document the need. Examples include statistics on HIV infection among IDUs in the local health jurisdiction (LH.J), statistics on viral hepatitis among IDUs in the LHJ, and the presence of IDUs in the location(s):
Orange County has not been spared from the negative effects of the opiate epidemic. According to the Orange County Health Care Agency (2017), Orange County experienced 12 drug
4

overdoses per 100,000 in 2015, whereas LA County experienced 7.2 per 100,000. Drug and alcohol overdoses have increased by 82% since 2000 in the county, and of the 700 overdose deaths per year, 66.9% were related to opioid use. In addition to these overdoses, Orange County saw 12.2 new HIV cases per 100,000. The prevalence of HIV in 2014 was 245.8 cases per 100,00. In Orange County, IV drug use transmits 9.1% of HIV cases, and 15.1% of the cases in Santa Ana, the county seat. According to the California Department of Public Health, Orange County saw 1,000 new cases of Hepatitis C in 2011. Recent research conducted by Marshall and colleagues (2018) demonstrates that a higher increase of cheaper heroin in Orange County has contributed to an increased rate of opioid use, leading to more overdose deaths among both the county's homeless and non-homeless populations. The use of non-prescription opioids, specifically intravenous use, will inevitably create larger health concerns for these individuals, both with regard to bloodborne disease contraction and other associated ailments such as abscesses. Needless to say, there is a tremendous need for OCNEP's services in Orange County.
OCNEP has seen over 15,000 clients since opening in February 2016. We have collected over 2.25 million syringes, and has distributed over 2.5 million syringes. In late 2017, we were exchanging over 80,000 syringes in a single day of operations, serving over 200 people in a two- hour time frame. This only scratches the surface of the high demand of harm reduction services in the county as the majority of our clients are from the immediate surrounding areas.

VI. Additional Required Information

Additional requirements for SEP Certification are listed in the California Code of Regulations Subchapter 15, Sections 7000 through 7016, Title 17, Division 1, Chapter 4. Applicants must attach a copy of each of the following:
a) Syringe Dispensing Plan as described in Section 7012(a);
OCNEP is applying to operate using a needs-based distribution model. However, Orange County has extremely negative perceptions about syringe litter, of which we are exceedingly aware. By being open on more days in more locations, and creating a specific email, and phone number for syringe waste complaints, we hope to mitigate the public's concerns. OCNEP will strive to ensure that the syringes we distribute are returned to the program and other authorized disposal locations. We will monitor how are effective our efforts are, and will take additional steps to increase returns, including changing distribution if needed,
Clients will handle their own sharps containers, and will dump used syringes into the disposal bin themselves. An intake volunteer will stand a ways back from the disposal bin, and will ask how many syringes the client disposed. The intake volunteer will then confirm the number of syringes visually based off of the volume returned. The client will then move to the supply distribution table. Here, they will work with a volunteer or staff personal to select the type of needles, and the quantity that they would like. After this process, they will be given supplies including: sterile water or saline, cookers & twist ties, tourniquets, sterile cotton, and alcohol

5

pads. We also offer condoms, lube, abscess kits, band-aids, hand sanitizer, gauze, and 8-gallon, 2-gallon, and 1-quart sized personal sharps containers.
OCNEP has a standing order for naloxone distribution and will be providing naloxone and overdose response training at all of our mobile locations.
b) Syringe Collection and Disposal Plan as described in Section 7012(b);
Clients will dispose of their used syringes in standard, OSHA-compliant sharps containers under observation of OCNEP staff after providing the number of syringes to be disposed of to the intake staff member. As these containers fill, they are securely closed and placed in a secure location away from clients and staff. Grabbers and sharps-resistant gloves are available at all times. If syringes fall outside of : sharps container, clients are asked to retrieve them, using the protective equipment listed above if desired, and to place them in the container. This strategy has worked effectively and safely for our two years of active operation.
Following the closure of the exchange, all areas operated in and the surrounding region will be iaspected for syringe litter, which will be disposed of in the same fashion as our other syringes.
OCNEP currently has a waste disposal contract through the CDPH Syringe Exchange Supplies Clearinghouse. The syringes collected at OCNEP will continue to be collected weekly by a certified biomedical waste hauling compány (currently Biomedical Waste Disposal, Inc.) on site or at our locked, gated, storage facility. Staff will be educated as to the sharps requirements outlined in Health and Safety Code § 118286 in their mandatory training prior to working at OCNEP. All containers will be properly sealed prior to transport.
Please see Appendix A for details on our staff training and Appendix B for our needlestick protocol.
c) Service Delivery Plan as described in Section 7012(c);
OCNEP will provide the following services: 1. Provision of sterile syringes and other injection supplies 2. Disposal of used syringes 3. Provision of or referrals to HIV and hepatitis C testing 4. Provision of condoms and safer-sex supplies 5. Harm reduction education and materials 6. Referrals to drug abuse treatment services, vaccination, STD testing, housing services, and other social and health services as requested 7: Naloxone training and distribution
OCNEP currently provides HIV and hepatitis È testing and intermittent vaccination through partnerships with Radiant Health Center (formerly the AIDS Service Foundation OC) and the Orange County Health Care Agency. At mobile sites, OCNEP cannot guarantee that these services will be available on-site, but will always be able to provide referrals to these services.

d) Data Collection and Program Evaluation Plan as described in Section 7022(d);
OCNEP routinely collects all data required by California Health and Safety Code §121349 and submits this information to CDPH as required by regulation. Additionally, OCNEP has operated multiple research studies on client demography, police interactions, and syringe litter, and expects to submit this data for publication in spring of 2018.
Weekly, OCNEP conducts thorough visual inspection walkthroughs in the regions OCNEP operates, currently, the Santa Ana Civic Center. Once approved to operate in additional regions, OCNEP will expand these walkthroughs to all areas of operations. Syringes found will be documented and disposed of appropriately with the rest of our biohazardous waste stream.
OCNEP will continue to solicit comments from clients on a weekly basis. The organization will also conduct an annual survey when funding and staffing resources are available. Clients are also welcome to work with the organization, and to attend steering committee meetings. OCNEP will continue to hold client meetings after the program closes when clients are interested and available to meet.

e) Community Relations Plan as described in Section 7022(e);
Positive community relationships are a key component of our program. From the very beginning, we have incorporated suggestions and concerns of community members to ensure successful implementation of our program. A partial list of strong supporters, including local businesses, health professionals, and other service providers is listed on the front page of our website. Additionally, we have several petitions with hundreds of signatories both in Santa Ana and elsewhere demonstrating community support and need for services.
In order to deal with issues surrounding needle litter in the community, OCNEP will conduct visual inspection walkthroughs in OCNEP's operational regions as described in section (d) above. OCNEP will keep track of where the syringes have been discarded over time, and will work to find solutions, such as installing permanent disposal bins, for areas that are known "hot spots". We have provided contact information to complainants within the Santa Ana.Civic Center, the City of Santa Ana, and the Santa Ana Police Department, but as this application regards a county-wide program, OCNEP will set up an email account specifically for information regarding discarded needles in Orange County and display it on our website. The email address will forward to the steering committee, and the location and number of needles found will be recorded. OCNEP will then respond to the needle litter complaint within 48 hours. OCNEP will also organize additional needle sweeps with volunteers and steering committee members. These will happen to greater degrees whenever staffing is available.
OCNEP will continue to welcome feedback from the community by both phone and email. Our contact information will be posted on our website. OCNEP will respond to phone calls and emails within 48 hours.

In order to work with the county and law enforcement, OCNEP is willing to meet with both entities on a regular basis. OCNEP will attempt to meet with the county government, the sheriff's department, and members of the community at least once a year to discuss the program and any concerns. This, however, will be dependent on the availability of the county, the sheriff's department, any concerned community members, and the volunteer staff at OCNEP. If funds are available, OCNEP plans to host this annual meeting.
Lastly, OCNEP will coordinate police training seminars for local law enforcement agencies that will train officers on how to handle and dispose of needles safely. These seminars will also go over the importance of syringe exchange, and the laws about carrying syringes.
f) A budget for the program which includes a minimum projected income and costs for personnel, outside services and operating expenses, including but not limited to rent, utilities, equipment, materials including syringes and disposal containers, transportation, insurance, training, meetings, syringe disposal services, and indireci costs.
OCNEP currently receives in-kind supplies through the CDPH Syringe Exchange Clearinghouse. Additionally, we are funded by private donors, AIDS United, the California Medical Association Foundation, the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation, the Arnold P. Gold Foundation, the California HealthCare Foundation, and others. We have operated for over two years with no issues of financial hardship. Our most up-to-date expenditure budget is attached below in Appendix C.

Appendix A. Staff Training
All staff and volunteers must observe proper safety and security precautions during syringe exchange operations. All volunteers seeking to work on-site at OCNEP must complete the OCNEP Training Program and the OCNEP Mentorship Program. Volunteers will be trained to understand and implement evidence-based harm reduction approaches to conducting needle exchanges. The safety of our volunteers and success of the program depends on our up to-date protocols and practices.

OCNEP Training Program
The OCNEP Training Program is based on the best practices established by other needle exchange programs, local and state public health authorities, the Harm Reduction Coalition, and the World Health Organization. The Training Program will be periodically updated.
Training will be conducted by experienced experts from local HIV/STD prevention agencies and experienced OCNEP members.
Training will include, but not be limited to, the following: An overview of harm reduction philosophies and techniques; An overview of OCNEP's harm reduction model;
• An overview of the logistics behind OCNEP's mobile exchange program; A detailed lecture on safety guidelines and protocols; which will include a large segment on the prevention and management of needlestick injuries; An overview of the security measures taken to maintain the supply of needles, syringes, etc.;
An overview of OCNEP's volunteer policy; and
• An overview of client rights and responsibilities.
OCNEP Mentorship Program
The OCNEP Mentorship Program requires all volunteers to shadow at an established needle exchange program or be mentored at OCNEP until their competency is established. Now that OCNEP has opened, volunteers are expected to complete their mentorship on-site at OCNEP, however, shadowing at the Los Angeles Community Health Project remains an acceptable alternative. Experienced OCNEP members will clarify the procedures, answer questions, and have additional discussions with new OCNEP volunteers and determine whether they have established competency to work on-site at OCNEP. To keep OCNEP volunteers up to date with logistics and safety protocols, continuing education will be required.
* Under ali circumstances, OCNEP staff, peers and volunteers are expected to place their own safety first and to follow their best judgment, referring to this protocol and using supervisory support as needed. No procedural guidelines can anticipate every situation that could arise, hence training, shadowing, and mentoring is mandatory.

9

Our needlestick injury protocol is based off the emergency needlestick injury protocol developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Specifically, if a needlestick injury occurs, the patient will wash the area with soap and water, notify on-site staff and OCNEP administration, and see a physician for medical advice, testing, and post-exposure prophylaxis if indicated. This protocol will be part of mandatory staff training, and a description of the protocol will be posted on-site. Please see Appendix B on the following page for details.

Dear California Department of Public Health (CDPH):

I am writing on behalf of the Orange County Board of Supervisors, and as Chairman of the Board, to express our opposition to the establishment of a mobile Orange County Needle Exchange Program (OCNEP) due to the health and safety threat that it poses to the residents of Orange County, California.
As you know, OCNEP became the first needle exchange program here in Orange County when it was in approved for operation by CDPH in 2016. Citing public health risks, the City of Santa Ana declined to renew OCNEP's permit after allowing the program to operate in the Santa Ana Civic Center from February, 2016 until January, 2018.

During that time, Santa Ana Public Library staff have reported finding as many as 40-50 discarded syringes on the property per month, including on shelves, near players, window sills, and even inside books, posing a threat to patrons. The City of Santa Ana has also shared instances of employees being pricked by discarded needles, which litter parks and sidewalks. While substance use disorder certainly impacts individuals from all communities, research indicates that substance abuse is more common among individuals experiencing homelessness, and the City of Santa Ana estimates its unsheltered
homeless population to have more than doubled from 2017 to 2018.

After being denied a local permit by the City of Santa Ana, OCNEP is now seeking to make their operations mobile and travel to a variety of cities here. Law enforcement officials in the City of Costa Mesa, one stated destination for the mobile unit, fear the program will make the city's drug problem worse by attracting users from other cities where a needle exchange program does not exist.
The County of Orange is not without compassion for those struggling with substance use issues. Our Health Care Agency already provides HIV prevention programs that include messaging about the risks of sharing needles and makes referrals to drug treatment programs. Our staff offers substance use disorder programs and services in an attempt to eliminate drug use, thereby lowering the risk of needle
sharing for those who are successful in treatment.

urge you to deny OCNEP's application to operate a mobile needle exchange here in Orange County and am available at (714) 834-3110 and Andrew.Do@ocgov.com to answer any questions you may have.
Thank you for your consideration.

RESOLUTION OF THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO OPPOSE THE ORANGE COUNTY NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAM
June 5, 2018
WHEREAS, the first obligation of the Orange County Board of Supervisors is to ensure the safety and wellbeing of its residents; and
WHEREAS, the Orange County Needle Exchange Program became the first ever needle- exchange in Orange County when it was approved for operation by the California Department of Public Health in 2016; and
WHEREAS, the City of Santa Ana declined to renew the permit for Orange County Needle Exchange after allowing the program to operate in the Santa Ana Civic Center from February, 2016 until January, 2018; and
WHEREAS the City of Santa Ana discontinued their needle exchange program due to the public health threat posed by a sharp increase in discarded syringes in the Civic Center; and
WHEREAS, the Santa Ana Public Library suffered an increase of syringe littering including reports of syringes left on shelves, near planters, window sills, and even in books; and
WHEREAS, Santa Ana Public Library representatives have been reported to have said that "before the needle exchange opened, library staff rarely found syringes in the facility, but began to find 40 to 50 a month after it opened"; and
WHEREAS, the City of Santa Ana's rampant problem with syringes after the needle exchange's inception included instances of employees being pricked by discarded needles; and
WHEREAS, the Orange County Needle Exchange Program plans to distribute syringes on a one-for-one plus 20 basis, dramatically increasing the number of syringes in Orange County; and
WHEREAS, the Orange County Needle Exchange Program indicates that while in operation it was disposing of approximately 20,000 needles per week; and
WHEREAS, using the one-for-one plus 20 rate of needle exchange, the collection of 20,000 needles per week would equate to 420,000 needles released into the community per week; and
WHEREAS, during the Environmental Remediation Project along the Santa Ana River Trail carlier this year, approximately 14,000 needles were removed from a less than four mile stretch in a two week period; and
WHEREAS, the Orange County Needle Exchange would endanger our communities and sacrifice the safety of our public in exchange for providing safe drug use to progtam users, now, therefore be it

RESOLVED, that the Orange County Board of Supervisors does hereby oppose the establishment of the Orange County Needle Exchange Program and the health and safety risks that it poses to the County of Orange, and directs the Clerk of the Board to submit this resolution to the California Department of Public Health before the June 25th 2018 deadline.

PO Box 997377, MS 0500
Sacramento, CA 95899-7377

Email: SEPApplication@cdph.ca.gov
Dear Ms. Crump:
This office serves as City Attorney to the City of Costa Mesa ("City") and provides the following public comment related to the Orange County Needle Exchange Program's application to operate a necdle exchange in the City of Costa Mesa.
Title 17 California Code of Regulations Section 7004 provides for the denial of an application to operate a needle exchange in the event that:
(a) Information submitted in the application is incorrect or incomplete, (b) The applicant docs not meet all the requirements listed in Health and Safety Code Section 121349, (c) Evidence of projected harm to public safety, presented by local law enforcement official(s), is, in the department's judgment, greater than evidence of projected benefits to public health.
For the reasons set forth below, the City respectfully requests the California Department of Public Health (*DPH") deny OCNEP's application in that (1) the information submitted in OCNEP's application is incorrect or incomplete; (2) OCNEP does not meet all of the requirements listed in Health and Safety Code Section 121349; and (3) the evidence of harm to public safety presented by the Costa Mesa Police Department and Santa Ana Police Department demonstrate far greater harm than evidence of benefits to public health; the delails of which are described in greater detail below.

I. Information Submitted in the Application is Incorrect or Incomplete

A. Days and Hours of Operation
OCNEP's application is incorrect or incomplete as it pertains to its hours of operation. On the one hand, under SEP Locations, Days and Hours of Operation of OCNEP's application, the organization requests to operate in Costa Mesa "every first Friday in Costa Mesa from 1-3 pm...' however, in another area, OCNEP proposes a far greater time period of "daily between the hours of 10 AM and 5 PM." 5 There is a vast different between a 2 hour per month operation proposed, on the one hand, and up to 210 hours per month proposed, on the other hand. This gross disparity between the two time periods raises a number of questions. If there is a need for a daily operation from 10-5 pm, why does the application not propose a brick and mortar stationary location as opposed to a mobile dispensary that covers a ¼ to ½ mile radius to operate? How would the applicant go about ensuring the safe recovery and disposal of used syringes with the operation of a mobile dispensary operating daily in various locations on a daily basis? Has the applicant demonstrated an adequate need for a 10-5 daily operation in 4 separate cities throughout Orange County? incomplete and should be denied. Given these significant questions, the application is

B. Neighborhood or Homeowner Association Information
The OCNEP application states that there are "No HOA or NA in the blocks we've selected. The closest ones are Newport Crest (1.6 miles south) and Pacific Ave (2 miles north)". This is clearly not the case as evidenced by the outpouring of public concern DPH received once the public was made aware of OCNEP's application. Note that OCNEP proposes to operate within an approximately ½ mile radius that includes at least two 55+ senior multi-unit living communities, Play Port Mobile Village and Greenleaf Park, not to mention Whittier Elementary School which sits just outside the northern boundary proposes and many of which include homeowner's assocations and/or a parent teacher assocation. Yet, none of these entities are identified in OCNEP's application and would not have been notified, but for, the outreach that was conducted by the City of Costa Mesa. A more thorough though process and investigation as part of the application process would've uncovered these groups. Instead, the application is incomplete and omits key public interest groups DPH should be aware as part of its decision making process.

II. The Applicant Does Not Meet All the Requirements Listed in Health and Safety
Code Section 121349

Health and Safety Code Section 121349 requires the applicant to demonstrate the ability to do a number of things, many of which are not supported by this applicant. Specifically, Section 121349(c)(3)(C) requires the applicant to "Ip]rovide for the safe recovery and disposal of used syringes and sharps waste from all of its participants." As demonstrated in photographs, letters and other documentary evidence of OCNEP's operation within the Santa Ana Civic Center, it is clear that OCNEP is not able to provide for the safe recovery and disposal of used syringes and sharp waste from all of its participants" within a fixed location and that evidence in the State Public Health Service's possession should be a part of the record as DPH makes its decision on OCNEP's current application.

Additionally, in spite of serious issues related to OCNEP's operation in the Santa Ana Civic Center, OCNEP's application is devoid of any evidence or information as to how it will improve its operation so that the threats to the public health and safety of the community that occurred within the Santa Ana Civic Center do not also occur here. It is important to point out that the OCNEP's application is on a far grander scale than their prior, Santa Ana Civic Center, operation which was discontinued. Just to name a few distinctions, the Santa Ana Civic Center was in centralized fixed location which, in theory, would've allowed them to pick up used needles during and after their hours of operation. In this case, however, the area proposed is far greater with an operation that is mobile and that covers an area of approximately ¼ to ½ mile making it far more difficult to recover and dispose of used syringes. Another distinction is that OCNEP's current application is on a much grander scale-4 mobile dispensaries in multiple cities while their prior operation was in the City of Santa Ana alone. Given OCNEP's failure to meet this criteria in Santa Ana, and its failure to demonstrate how it will avoid these deficiencies here, it is clear that OCNEP does not meet the criteria in Health and Safety Code Section 121349.
III. Evidence of proiected harm to public safety, presented by local law enforcement official(s)

Finally, all of the photographs, letters and other written correspondence provided by the City of Santa Ana and Santa Ana Police Department related to OCNEP's operation in the Santa Ana Civic Center demonstrate that the harm to the public safety exceeds the public health benefit of OCNEP's operation of four (4) mobile dispensaries covering a far greater area than their prior operation which was terminated due to numerous issues. Moreover, as indicated above, OCNEP's application fails to explain what improvements it would make in its operation so as to ensure the same programs do not occur with this much expanded operation. Again, given these deficiencies, it is clear that the harm to public safety exceeds the public benefit.
For the foregoing reasons, the City Attorney's Office respectfully requests that DPH deny OCNEP's application in accordance with Title 17 California Code of Regulations Section 7004 based on the foregoing.

Sincerely,
Ve Yolanda Mi Summerhill Costa Mesa City Attorney's Office

Dear Ms. Crump:
The City of Orange is submitting this letter to the California Department of Public Health to
express our opposition to an application by the Orange County Needle Exchange Program (OCNEP) to provide syringc exchange service in the City of Orange.
Based on the location indicated in their application, it appears OCNEP is intending to serve the area adjacent to the Santa Ana River Recreation Trail (SART). While the SART had been a location where homeless encampments have been in existence for a few years, the County of Orange, under the supervision of Federal Judge David O. Carter recently cleared out the encampments. As such, there is not a homeless population that resides in the area targeted for the syringe exchange program.
The County of Orange, in cooperation with the City of Orange has expended a significant amount of resources to properly relocate the homeless individuals from SART and restore the area for public recreational purposes. Please know that Orange has a long track record of compassion and outreach to the homeless population and those facing drug addiction in our
community, however it would not be prudent to offer a program that would re-introduce homeless individuals back to the SART area.
Further, the City of Orange also has concerns related to the operations of the program. Specifically, the recent experience in the City of Santa Ana, which revoked the permit for a needle exchange program, suggests that the program resulted in uncapped hypodermic needles littering the area in and around the Santa Ana Civic Center, endangering the public working and visiting the area.
Therefore, based on the above noted concerns, the City of Orange opposes the OCNEP application to establish a syringe exchange in Orange.

Dear Ms. Crump,

On behalf of the Anaheim City Council, the City of Anaheim is submitting this letter to the California Department of Public Health to express our opposition to an application by the Orange County Needle Exchange Program (OCNEP) to provide a syringe exchange service in the City of Anaheim.

Based on the location indicated in their application, it appears OCNEP is intending to serve our downtown area near La Palma Park, an area where the city has significantly reduced encampments and will be relocating homeless services, such as check-in of personal belongings. Further, this area is adjacent to a dog park, stadium events for our schools, soccer and baseball fields for our children, and open space for families and the community to gather. Of equal significance, the city learned about OCNEPs application from residents; OCNEP has failed to contact the city, law enforcement and neighborhood associations, thereby not "respecting... local preference," as directed by Governor Brown.

Further, the City of Anaheim also has concerns related to the prior operations of OCNEP. Specifically, the City of Santa Ana recently revoked OCNEPs permit due to uncapped hypodermic needles littering the area in and around their downtown and endangering the public who work and visit the area. Bringing this program into our La Palma Park area where we have a dog park, stadium events for our schools, fields for our children to play soccer and baseball and open space for families to gather would not be an appropriate place to introduce this type of program.

In 2013, the city launched Coming Home Anaheim as a tool to address the a needs of the homeless through collaboration with other cities, local service providers and faith-based communities. It was through this collaboration that today the city, through our contract with City Net, have successfully moved over 1,200 individuals out of homelessness into housing with a 92% retention rate. In addition, in January 2017, the city created Drug Free Anaheim where anyone suffering from addiction can simply walk into our police station and ask for services, such as detox, partial hospitalization, outpatient counseling and/or support group referrals. To date, almost 300 individuals have participated in the program with over 220 individuals in treatment facilities. Drug Free Anaheim is managed by professional experts in the field of addiction and they have expressed great concerns with this particular syringe exchange program by OCNEP, advising the program could potentially disrupt the successful services of recovery treatment in Anaheim.

Anaheim is a proven leader in providing compassion and outreach to not only our homeless
population but also those dealing with drug addiction and it would not be prudent to offer a program that would potentially re-introduce a negative attraction into our community who is already making progress in our pathways to home, healing and work.

Based on the above concerns and recent experiences with our neighboring city, the City of Anaheim opposes the OCNEP application to establish a syringe exchange program in Anaheim.

Sincerely, Qo EP Jose Moreno
Mayor Pro Tem, on behalf of Mayor Tom Tait

Ms. Carol Crump, MFT California Department of Public Health P.O. Box 997377, MS 0500
Sacramento, CA 95899-7377

Dear Ms. Crump:

On behalf of the Anaheim Police Department (APD), I submit this letter to the California Department of Public Health in opposition to an application by the Orange County Needle Exchange Program (OCNEP) to provide a syringe exchange service in the City of Anaheim.
The application submitted by OCNEP includes a program model and several components which are concerning in terms of public safety and quality of life in certain impacted areas. Since the application was submitted, have spoken with law enforcement chief executives both locally and in other parts of the country where OCNEP and similar programs have been in operation. One consistent byproduct from these programs was gleaned through these conversations: the significant increase and proliferation of both used and unused syringes in the areas surrounding the locations where these programs are operational. Even without a program similar to one being sought by the applicant, Anaheim recently experienced a problem in a specific geographic area wherein substantial quantities of syringes began appearing in public places including bus stops, libraries and in parks. It was determined the proliferation was due to a local retailer selling inexpensive syringes in gross quantities. APD worked with the retailer, which changed its practices and the problem has been resolved.
The applicant's selection of the intended location to operate this mobile program is also troubling in many regards. The location is one with many existing challenges, and one which the City has made great progress in improving in terms of homelessness, drug use and crime. OCNEP's proposed application would create a draw for individuals who engage in intravenous drug use to this location, and likely a draw for drug sellers as well. Further, this area is adjacent to a dog park, event and sports stadium and one of the City's largest parks. Used by families and children, these public spaces would be significantly and negatively impacted by this program due to discarded syringes and illegal conduct which is completely inconsistent with the intended use of these limited public resources.
Finally, APD and the City in collaboration with neighboring police agencies and community-based organizations have made tremendous strides in addressing homelessness in Anaheim over the past five years. More than 1,200 individuals have been

425 S. Harbor Blvd. assisted out of homelessness into housing with a 92% retention rate. In addition, APD
Anaheim. CA 92805 administers the City's Drug Free Anaheim program in which persons suffering from addiction can simply walk into any police station or approach any officer and ask for help. T: (714) 765-1900 As an alternative to arrest and prosecution, these individuals are assisted with managed F: (714) 765-1690

referrals. To date, almost 300 individuals have participated in the program with over 220 individuals in treatment facilities. Experts in the field of addiction, the third party provider facilitating Drug Free Anaheim has expressed great concerns with this proposed syringe exchange program by OCNEP, advising the program could potentially disrupt the recovery and treatment successes we have made.

In consideration of the recent local and out of state experiences highlighted above coupled with the likely degradation of our progress in addressing homelessness and drug addiction in our community, the APD opposes the OCNEP application to establish a syringe exchange program in Anaheim.

Re: NOTICE OF INTENT TO FILE CEQA PETITION
Dear Dr. Smith:

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under Public Resources Code §21167.5, that petitioner City of Anaheim intends to file a petition under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (as well as under other California codes and regulations) against Respondents, California Department of Health and Karen L.

Among other allegations as set forth in the Petition, the Petitioners, including Anaheim, allege that Respondents did not comply with CEQA because they did not consider the environmental consequences of their actions and make CEQA findings before exercising their discretion to approve the project, which was the application of the Real Party in Interest.
The Petition will seck a writ of mandamus, declaratory relief, a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, and a permanent injunction prohibiting the operation of the needle exchange program. A copy of the Petition to be filed by Petitioners is attached to this notice.

Very truly yours,

Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (37-2018-00039176-CU-MC-CTL)

1
INTRODUCTION
2 The motion for preliminary injunction (Motion) seeks to prohibit the operation of a new
3 mobile clean needle and syringe exchange program (SEP)' in Orange County (1) even though
4 evidence shows that Orange County has had dramatically increasing rates of intravenous drug
5 users and associated bloodborne infections in recent years; (2) even though the California
6 Department of Public Health (Department) imposed express conditions to address syringe litter in
7 the authorization that it issued to the Orange County Needle Exchange Program (OCNEP) to
8
operate its SEP; (3) even though volumes of scientific research and public health studies have
9 consistently shown that SEPs are crucial to reducing the spread of bloodborne infections such as
10 the hepatitis B virus (HBV), the hepatitis C virus (HCV), and the human immunodeficiency virus 11 (HIV); and (4) even though the California Legislature expressly recognized the public health
12 value of SEPs when it enacted Health and Safety Code section 121349 and gave the Department 13
the authority to authorize SEPs "notwithstanding any other law."
14 Injunctive relief should be denied because it is unlikely that plaintiffs will prevail on the
15 merits of any of their causes of action. In addition, the harm that would befall the public should 16 OCNEP's SEP be enjoined would be substantial, and potentially devastating, while petitioners
17
will suffer little to no harm should the status quo be maintained. This is so, given the syringe 18 litter prevention conditions that are part and parcel of the authorization that was issued to OCNEP
19 and given that the evidence before this Court demonstrates that OCNEP's operation will actually
20 reduce syringe litter. The Court should deny the Motion for these reasons. 21
STATEMENT OF FACTS
22 The Office of AIDS within the Department operates the Syringe Exchange Certification 23 Program for the State of California. (Declaration of Brian D. Lew (Lew Decl.), 131.) An entity
24 that seeks state authorization to operate an SEP must file an application for certification with the 25

26 An SEP is a program that provides sterile needles and syringes and collects used sharps 27 waste from injection drug users free of charge in an effort to reduce the spread of human

28 immunodeficiency virus, viral hepatitis, and other bloodborne pathogens. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 17, § 7000, subd. (a)(27).)
5

Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (37-2018-00039176-CU-MC-CTL)

1 Office of AIDS. (Lew Decl., 1 32.) An application must contain all of the information required 2 by Health and Safety Code section 121349 and by California Code of Regulations, title 17,
0) section 7002, including:
+10 0 a, A showing that the entity provides the following services, directly or by referral: Drug abuse treatment services; HIV or hepatitis screening; hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccination; screening for sexually transmitted infections; housing services for the homeless, for victims of domestic violence, or other similar housing services; and services aimed at reducing risky sexual behaviors including the distribution of
7 condoms.

8 b. A needs statement that includes information about the presence or absence of other
9 syringe exchange services in the proposed location.

10 C. A description of the proposed syringe exchange services, the anticipated number of
participants to be served each year, and the estimated number of syringes to be
11 dispensed and collected cach year.

12 (Lew Decl., 1 33.)

13 OCNEP is a volunteer-run nonprofit corporation, located in Orange County, which

14 provides sterile syringes, HIV and HCV testing, safer sex resources, and safe needle disposal.

15 (Lew Decl., 134.) On January 17, 2018, OCNEP submitted an application to the Office of AIDS

16 to operate a mobile SEP in four cities in Orange County, California: Santa Ana; Orange;

17 Anaheim; and Costa Mesa. (Lew Decl., $35 & Exh. I.) At the time of its January 2018

18 application, OCNEP was certified by the Department to provide syringe exchange services at a

19 fixed location at the Santa Ana Civic Center, (Lew Decl., 1 36.) Through its January 2018

20 application, OCNEP sought to expand its services to other sites by operating in a truly mobile

21 fashion. (Lew Decl., 1 37.)

22 As part of its consideration of OCNEP's application, the Department identified Orange

23 County as among the California counties most vulnerable to rapid spread of HIV and HCV

24 infections because Orange County had a 201% increase in rates of HCV from 2011 to 2015, and

25 the rate of newly-diagnosed HIV cases in Orange County per 100,000 persons in the population

26 increased from 5.2 in 2012 to 6.8 in 2016. (Lew Decl., T40.) Further, an estimated 1% of

27 Orange County residents (or 26,233 people) have an opioid use disorder, and 207 people from

28 Orange County died from opioid overdose in 2017, which represents a rate 36% higher than the

6

Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (37-2018-00039176-CU-MC-CTL)

1 California average. (Lew Decl., 140.) The Department ultimately determined that the services
2 proposed to be performed by OCNEP would play a crucial role in preventing the spread of HIV 3 and HCV in Orange County, and would offer support and connect injection drug users to critical v medical care and social services. (Lew Decl., 141.)
5 On or about March 27, 2018, the Office of AIDS determined that OCNEP's application to
6 operate a mobile SEP was provisionally appropriate, and, as a result, the Office of AIDS initiated
7 the period of public comment on the application via an announcement on its website. (Lew Decl.,
8 143 & Exh. J.) During the public comment period, the Department sent e-mail notices of
9 OCNEP's proposed operation to the local health officer for Orange County and to the chiefs of
10 police of the four cities where OCNEP proposed to operate, and the Department encouraged them
11 to share the information with their constituents. (Lew Decl., 1 44 & Exh. K.) A total of 688
12 public comments were submitted concerning OCNEP's application during the 90-day public
13 comment period. (Lew Decl., 146.) Of these, 398 were in opposition to the application, and 290
14 were in support. (Lew Decl., 146.) During the public comment period, the Department also
15 received letters from the Anaheim Police Department, the Chief of Police for the City of Orange,
16 the City of Costa Mesa Police Department, the Chief of Police for the City of Santa Ana, and the
17 Chairman of the Orange County Board of Supervisors. (Lew Decl., 146 & Exh. L.) The
18 Department carefully considered all comments that it received on OCNEP's application during
19 the public comment period and used those comments to inform its decision-making process.
20
(Lew Decl., 1 50.)
21 On July 27, 2018, the State Epidemiologist submitted a memorandum to the Director of
22 the Department, requesting and recommending approval of OCNEP's application, subject to
23 conditions in order to accommodate concerns that were conveyed to the Department during the
24 public comment period. (Lew Decl., T 51 & Exh. M.) The recommended conditions were to
25 narrow the geographic scope of OCNEP's service areas and to enhance syringe litter recovery 26 efforts. (Lew Decl., 1 51 & Exh. M.) The memorandum further informed that, as a condition of
27 receiving Department authorization to operate its mobile SEP, OCNEP agreed to work with the
28

7

Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (37-2018-00039176-CU-MC-CTL)

-

2 Orange County Health Care Agency to expand sharps? disposal options, operate a hotline and an

3 e-mail address through which to field reports of improperly discarded syringes, develop a map of

4 litter hotspots to inform strategic syringe litter collection, conduct additional syringe recovery

5 services including area sweeps in and around mobile service areas, document concerns and

6 positive feedback expressed by those impacted by the operation, and document steps taken by the

7 program to address the concerns. (Lew Decl., 151 & Exh. M.) On July 30, 2018, the Director of

8 the Department accepted the State Epidemiologist's request and recommendation to approve

9 OCNEP's application with amendments that were based on the recommended conditions. (Lew

10 Decl., T 52.) Effective August 6, 2018, the Department issued an authorization to OCNEP to

operate

11 mobile SEP at four locations in Orange County, with the amendments approved by the
Director. (Lew Decl., 153 & Exh. N.)

12 ARGUMENT

13 I. STANDARD FOR ISSUANCE OF A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION

14

15 In deciding whether to issue a preliminary injunction, a trial court must evaluate two

16 factors: (1) the likelihood that the plaintiff will prevail on the merits at trial; and (2) the interim

17 harm that the plaintiff is likely to sustain if the injunction is denied compared with the harm that

18 the defendant is likely to suffer if the preliminary injunction is issued. (Langford v. Superior

19 Court (1987) 43 Cal.3d 21, 28.) In addition, as explained by the California Supreme Court, a

20 preliminary injunction is an order sought by a plaintiff "prior to a full adjudication of the merits

21 of its claim." (White v. Davis (2003) 30 Cal.4th 528, 554, emphasis in original.) Hence, to obtain

22 such provisional relief, "a plaintiff ordinarily is required to present evidence of

23 the irreparable injury or interim harm that it will suffer if an injunction is not issued pending an
adjudication of the merits." (Id., emphasis added.)

24

25 Thus, here, the inquiry involves three questions. First, whether petitioners can

26 demonstrate that they are likely to prevail on the merits of the causes of action pled in the First

27 Amended Complaint (FAC). Second, whether petitioners are likely to suffer irreparable harm if

28 "Sharps, as the term is used herein, are hypodermic needles, pen needles, intravenous needles, lancets, and other devices that are used to penetrate the skin. (Lew Decl., 17.)
8

Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (37-2018-00039176-CU-MC-CTL)

interim relief is withheld. Third, what harm the State and its citizens would suffer should the
2 injunction be issued. As is shown below, petitioners are not likely to prevail on the merits of any
3 of their causes of action, petitioners are not likely to suffer irreparable harm if the request for
4 injunctive relief is denied, and the public will suffer great harm if the injunction is issued.
5
II. PETITIONERS ARE NOT LIKELY TO PREVAIL ON ANY OF THEIR CAUSES OF ACTION
6 The FAC alleges five causes of action, each of which will fail for the reasons given below.
7
A. The cause of action for violation of the Medical Waste Management Act 8 will fail as a matter of law

9 The first cause of action (see FAC, 11 40-43) is not likely to succeed on the merits because

10 the cause of action has not been brought in the correct county, and because petitioners failed to

11 exhaust their administrative remedies in regard to the cause of action. In particular, the Medical

12 Waste Management Act (Act) is set forth in Health and Safety Code section 117600 et seq. An

13 action to enjoin a violation or threatened violation of the Act must be brought in the superior

14 court in the county where the violation occurred, or where it is about to occur:

15 An enforcement agency, district attorney, city attorney, or city prosecutor may

16 bring an action to enjoin the violation, or threatened violation, of this part or the regulations adopted pursuant to this part, in the superior court in the county where the violation occurred or is about to occur.
17

18
(Health & Saf. Code, § 118325, emphasis added.)
19 Accordingly, pursuant to the plain language of the statute, petitioners were required to
20 bring their action for alleged violation of the Act in the Orange County Superior Court. The
21 cause of action will, therefore, fail as a matter of law.
22 Petitioners are also unlikely to prevail on the cause of action for violation of the Act
23 because they failed to exhaust administrative remedies in regard to this cause of action. In
24 general, a party must exhaust administrative remedies before filing a lawsuit, and exhaustion of
25 administrative remedies is a jurisdictional prerequisite to resort to the courts. (Coachella Valley
26 Mosquito & Vector Control Dist. v. California Public Employment Relations Bd. (2005) 35
27 Cal.4th 1072, 1080.) The exhaustion doctrine is grounded on concerns favoring administrative
28

Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (37-2018-00039176-CU-MC-CTL)

autonomy and judicial efficiency. (Ibid.) Further, exhaustion requires "a full presentation to the
2 administrative agency upon all issues of the case and at all prescribed stages of the administrative
c proceedings." (Bleeck v. State Board of Optometry (1971) 18 Cal.App.3d 415, 432.) At no time t 1 0 during the public comment period on OCNEP's application did any person or entity contend that
OCNEP was required to obtain a local permit to dispose of the used syringes that it would collect
if its application was approved. (Lew Decl., 149.) Where, as here, the State provides a notice
7 and comment period, failure to raise an issue during that period supports dismissal for failure to
8 exhaust administrative remedies. For this additional reason, petitioners are not likely to prevail
9 on the first cause of action.
10
B. The cause of action for a writ of mandate will fail as a matter of law
11 The second cause of action (see FAC, 11 44-53) is not likely to succeed on the merits
12 because the Department and its Director complied with the governing law in their consideration
13 and approval of OCNEP's application, and because the Court should afford considerable
14 deference to the Department's determination in this regard given the Department's unique
15 expertise in overseeing SEPs.
16 Health and Safety Code section 121349 authorizes a clean needle and syringe exchange
17
project, "[i]n order to reduce the spread of HIV infection and bloodborne hepatitis among the
18 intravenous drug user population within California." (Health & Saf. Code, § 121349, subd. (b).)
19 The Legislature specifically provided in Health and Safety Code section 121349, subdivision (c),
20 that, notwithstanding any other law which may prohibit the operation of SEPs within California,
21 the Department may authorize qualified entities that have sufficient staff and capacity to provide
22
the services described in Health and Safety Code section 121349.1 to provide hypodermic needle
23 and syringe exchange services consistent with state standards in any location where the
24 Department determines that conditions exist for the rapid spread of HIV, viral hepatitis, or any
25 other potentially deadly or disabling infections that are spread through the sharing of syringes.
26 (Health & Saf. Code, § 121349, subd. (c).) Such authorizations shall be made after the
27 Department consults with the local health officer and local law enforcement leadership, and after
28

10

Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (37-2018-00039176-CU-MC-CTL)

-

2 a period of public comment. (Ibid.) In determining whether to issue an authorization to an SEP,

3 the Department "shall balance the concerns of law enforcement with the public health benefits [of
the proposed SEP]." (Ibid.)

4

5 For an entity to be qualified to operate an SEP, its application to the Department shall show
that the entity:

6

7 1. Provides, directly or through referral, drug abuse treatment services; HIV or hepatitis

8 screening; hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccination; screening for sexually transmitted

9 infections; housing services; educational materials that address ways to reduce risky
sexual behaviors; and the distribution of condoms;

10

11 2, Has the capacity to start needle and syringe exchange services within three months of
the authorization;

12

13 3. Has adequate funding to furnish needles and syringe exchange services for all of its

14 participants; to provide HIV and viral hepatitis prevention education services for all of

15 its participants; and to provide for the safe recovery and disposal of used syringes and
sharps waste from all of its participants; and

16

17 4. Has the capacity and a plan to collect data regarding the total number of persons served;

18 the total number of syringes and needles distributed, recovered, and disposed of; and the

19 total numbers and types of referrals to drug treatment and other services.

20 (Health & Saf. Code, § 121349, subd, (d); see also Cal. Code Regs., tit. 17, § 7002.)

21 If the Department determines that an entity's application to operate an SEP is

22 provisionally appropriate, the Department shall, at least 45 days before it approves the

23 application, provide for a period of public comment as follows: By posting on the Department's

24 website the name of the applicant, the nature of the services, and the location where the entity

25 proposes to provide services; by sending a written and an e-mail notice to the local health officer

26 of the affected jurisdiction; and by sending a written and an e-mail notice to the chief of police,

27 the sheriff, or both, as appropriate, of the affected jurisdictions. (Health & Saf. Code, § 121349,

28 subd. (e).) At the time that OCNEP submitted its application in January 2018, the public
comment period on an SEP's application was 90 days, commencing from the date the Department
11

Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (37-2018-00039176-CU-MC-CTL)

posted information about an application on its website. (See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 17, § 7000,
2
subd. (a)(22).)'
3 OCNEP's application to operate an SEP complied with all of the requirements set forth in A 1no Health and Safety Code section 121349, subdivision (d). (See Lew Decl., Exh. I.) Likewise, the
Department complied with the public comment requirements set forth in Health and Safety Code
section 121349, subdivision (e). (See Lew Decl., 11 43 -47.) Moreover, petitioners do not 7 dispute that the Department complied with the public comment requirements. Thus, petitioners 8 are not likely to prevail on the second cause of action.
9 In the Motion, petitioners argue that OCNEP's application was deficient because it did not
10 provide for the safe recovery and disposal of used syringes and sharps waste from its participants. 11 (Motion, pp. 1, 9.) That is inaccurate. The application did contain such provisions. (See Lew
12 Decl., Exh. I, p. 6.) Moreover, the application was not required to make such a showing; rather, 13 the application was required to show that OCNEP had adequate funding to provide for the safe 14 recovery and disposal of used syringes and sharps waste from all of its projected participants,
15 (See Health & Saf. Code, § 121349, subd. (d)(3)(C).) The application met this minimum funding 16 requirement. (See Lew Decl., Exh. I, p. 13.)
17 Finally, the context of the case at bar compels a high level of deference to the Department's 18 interpretation and application of the statutes and regulations that govern the issuance of
19 authorizations to SEPs. In particular, the extent of judicial deference that should be given to an 20 agency's interpretation of law is "fundamentally situational." (Citizens for Beach Rights v. City 21 of San Diego (2017) 10 Cal.App.5th 1301, 1312, citing Yamaha Corp. of America v. State Bd. of 22 Equalization (1998) 19 Cal.4th 1, 12.) "Greater deference should be given to an agency's 23 interpretation where the agency has expertise and technical knowledge, especially where the legal 24 text to be interpreted is technical, obscure, complex, open-ended, or entwined with issues of fact, 25

26 3 At present, there is a discrepancy between the statute's requirement of a minimum 45- day public comment period and the regulation's requirement of a 90-day public comment period.
27 The reason for the discrepancy is that the statute was amended on June 27, 2018, via Assembly Bill 1810, to change the public comment period to 45 days. However, here, the Department
28 provided a 90-day public comment period on OCNEP's application because, at the time that the application was submitted, the statute required a 90-day public comment period.
12

Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (37-2018-00039176-CU-MC-CTL)

1 policy, and discretion." (Citizens for Beach Rights v. City of San Diego, supra, 10 Cal.App.5th at
2 p. 312, internal quotations and citations omitted.) Here, great deference should be given to the
3 Department's interpretation and application of the statutes and regulations that govern SEPs given 4 that the Department is charged with operating the Syringe Exchange Certification Program for the
5 State of California and given that the Department has developed particular expertise in the area of
6 SEPs and the laws and policies that govern them. For this additional reason, it is unlikely that
7 petitioners will prevail on their writ of mandate cause of action.
8
C. The cause of action for declaratory relief will fail as a matter of law
The third cause of action for declaratory relief simply re-alleges the controversy between
10 the parties surrounding the grant of OCNEP's application (see FAC, 11 54-57), and the cause of
11 action will fail as a matter of law because petitioners will not prevail on the merits of any of the
12 other causes of action in the FAC.
13
D. The cause of action for public nuisance will fail as a matter of law 14 The fourth cause of action for public nuisance (see FAC, 11 58-61) will fail as a matter of 15 law because, "[n]othing which is done or maintained under the express authority of a statute can 16 be deemed a nuisance." (Civ. Code, § 3482.) Here, petitioners are complaining of the 17

18 Department's issuance of an authorization to OCNEP to operate an SEP, yet this authorization

was
19 done under the express authority of Health and Safety Code section 121349. The cause of
action will therefore fail.
20
E.
21 The cause of action for violation of CEQA will fail as a matter of law
The fifth cause of action (see FAC, 11 62-65) for violation of the California Environmental
22 Quality Act (CEQA), Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq., will fail as a matter of law
23 because petitioners failed to exhaust administrative remedies in regard to the cause of action. In
24 particular, exhaustion of administrative remedies is a jurisdictional prerequisite to resort to the
25 courts. (See, e.g., Coachella Valley Mosquito & Vector Control Dist. V. California Public 26 Employment Relations Bd., supra, 35 Cal.4th at p. 1080.) Furthermore, an action to attack a
27 public agency's actions or decisions on the grounds of noncompliance with CEQA shall not be
28

13
Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (37-2018-00039176-CU-MC-CTL)

2 brought "unless the alleged grounds for noncompliance with this division [CEQA] were presented

3 to the public agency orally or in writing by any person during the public comment period

4 provided by this division or prior to the close of the public hearing on the project before the

n issuance of the notice of determination." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21177, subd. (a).)

6 In other words, a CEQA challenge is not preserved unless the alleged grounds for

7 noncompliance with CEQA were presented to the agency during the public comment period.

8 (Citizens for Responsible Equitable Environmental Development v. City of San Diego (2011)

9 196 Cal.App.4th 515, 527.) "Exhaustion of administrative remedies is a jurisdictional

10 prerequisite to maintenance of a CEQA action." (Ibid., internal quotations omitted.) To

11 advance the purpose of the exhaustion doctrine, the exact issue must have been presented to the

12 agency. (Id. at p. 527.) The purpose of the exhaustion doctrine is to ensure agencies are given

13 the chance to decide matters within their expertise, respond to objections, and correct any errors

14 before the courts intervene. (Bridges v. Mt. San Jacinto Community College Dist. (2017) 14
Cal.App.5th 104, 115.)

15

16 A party must raise factual objections (such as syringe litter) and legal objections (failure
to comply with CEQA) at the administrative level so the

17 agency can correct errors before a

18 lawsuit is filed. (See Coalition for Student Action v. City of Fullerton (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d

19 1194, 1197 [explaining that the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies precludes

20 judicial review of issues, legal and factual, which were not first presented at the administrative

21 agency level].) At no time during the public comment period on OCNEP's application did any

22 person or entity contend that the Department was required to comply with CEQA during its

23 review and consideration of OCNEP's application. (Lew Decl., 148.) Accordingly, because

24 this Court lacks jurisdiction over petitioners' CEQA cause of action, they are not likely to
prevail on the fifth cause of action.

25

26 III. THE BALANCING OF THE HARMS WEIGHS HEAVILY IN FAVOR OF RESPONDENTS

27 Petitioners cannot satisfy the standard for obtaining preliminary injunctive relief because,

28 not only are they unlikely to prevail on the merits of their causes of action at trial, as discussed
above, but they are also unable to show that they will suffer irreparable injury if a preliminary
14

Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (37-2018-00039176-CU-MC-CTL)

injunction is not issued. In fact, as explained below, the State and its citizens will suffer great

2 harm if OCNEP's operation is enjoined because the operation will provide invaluable public

3 health benefits in a county that has an overwhelming need for an SEP, and because the evidence

4 establishes that OCNEP's operation will actually reduce syringe litter in Orange County.

5 A. SEPs are a valuable public health tool

6 The California Legislature has made clear that SEPs are essential to curtailing the spread of

7 disease among intravenous drug users:

8 The Legislature finds and declares that scientific data from needle exchange
9 programs in the United States and in Europe have shown that the exchange of used hypodermic needles and syringes for clean hypodermic needles and
10 syringes does not increase drug use in the population, can serve as an important bridge to treatment and recovery from drug abuse, and can curtail the spread of
11 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among the intravenous drug user population.
12

13 (Health & Saf. Code, § 121349, subd. (a).)

14 The Motion disregards this fundamental fact, which cannot be ignored as this Court

15 balances the benefits of the challenged SEP in this case with the harm that it will allegedly cause.

16 The Legislature's findings and declarations with regard to SEPs align with the evidence
on the effectiveness of SEPs and also with the conclusions reached in numerous studies that have 17

18 been published over the years in peer-reviewed journals. In particular, SEPs play a crucial role in

19 preventing the spread of blood-borne pathogens by removing contaminated syringes from

20 circulation. (Lew Decl., 10.) "Blood-borne pathogens" are pathogenic microorganisms that are

21 present in human blood, can cause disease in humans, and include but are not limited to HBV,

22 HCV, and HIV. (Lew Decl., $11.) Not only does syringe re-use increase the risk of spreading

23 it HIV, HBV, and HCV, but it also increases the risk of other negative health outcomes, including

24 permanent vein damage, skin and soft tissue infections, and invasive disease caused by pathogens

25 such as staphylococcus and streptococcus group bacteria. (Lew Decl., 1 12.)

26 SEPs have been rigorously studied since they were first introduced in the mid-1980's in

27 response to injection-related HIV transmission. (Lew Decl., 1 13.) The United States Public

28 Health Services recommends that, for those who are unable to stop injection drugs, a new, sterile

15

Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (37-2018-00039176-CU-MC-CTL)

H

2 syringe should be used for each injection. (Lew Decl., 1 14.) According to the United States

3 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, SEPs reduce HIV and viral hepatitis transmission,

4 reduce overdose mortality, increase entry into substance use disorder treatment, reduce needle-

5 stick injuries, save taxpayer funds, and do not increase drug use or crime. (Lew Decl., 1 15.) The

6 impact of SEPs has been most notable in terms of controlling the HIV epidemic. (Lew Decl., f

7 16.) In particular, between 2008 and 2014, the annual HIV diagnoses among people who inject

were

8 drugs in the United States fell by half. (Lew Decl., f 16.) In jurisdictions where SEPs

9 adopted early and publicly funded, injection-related HIV transmission has been steeply reduced,

10 such as in San Francisco where the number of infections decreased by two-thirds, and in New

11 York City where HIV prevalence among people who inject drugs fell from 54% in 1990 to 3% in

12 2012. (Lew Decl., 1 16.) SEPs also play an important role in the safe disposal of used syringes.

13 (Lew Decl., 1 17.) Studies have found, for example, that cities with SEPs have less syringe litter

14 than cities that do not have SEPs, and that syringes from SEPs are more likely to be safely

15 disposed of than those acquired from other sources. (Lew Decl., 1 17.) SEPs also serve as the

16 main platform for opioid overdose prevention among people at highest risk by training people on

17 prevention, first aid, and distributing the opioid overdose antidote naloxone. (Lew Decl., 1 19.)

18 Scores of government and professional organizations have endorsed SEPs, including the

19 American Medical Association, the American Nurses Association, the American Psychiatric

20 Association, the American Psychological Association, the American Public Health Association,

21 the American Society of Addiction Medicine, the United States Centers for Disease Control and

22 Prevention, the United States Conference of Mayors, and the American Bar Association, (Lew

23 1 Decl., 118.) The California chapters of these medical and public health associations have

24 similarly endorsed sterile syringe exchange as a best practice in HIV prevention. (Lew Decl.,
18.)

25

26 Evidence proves that SEPs work. For example, a study of the first American SEP,

27 founded in Tacoma, Washington in 1988, found that use of the SEP was associated with a greater

28 than 60% reduction in the risk of contracting HBV or HCV among injection drug users. (Lew
Decl., [20 & Exh. A.) Another study of over 1,600 injection drug users in New York City in the
16

Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (37-2018-00039176-CU-MC-CTL)

-

2 early 1990s found that users who did not participate in an SEP were more than three times as

3 likely to contract HIV as users who participated in the SEP. (Lew Decl., 1 21 & Exh. B.) The

4 study concluded that sterile injection equipment should be legally provided to reduce the risk of

5 HIV infection in persons who inject illegal drugs. (Lew Decl., 121 & Exh. B.) Further, SEPs do

6 more than just improve health. (Lew Decl., 122 & Exh. C.) They save taxpayer money because

7 they are effective and far less expensive than the lifetime cost of treating HIV, HBV, or HCV.

8 1 (Lew Decl., 1 22 & Exh. C.) A study published in 2014 confirmed that one dollar invested in

9 SEPs saves at least six dollars in avoided costs associated with HIV alone. (Lew Decl., 122 &

10 Exh. C.) Studies have also shown that SEPs do not promote drug use and do not raise crime

11 levels, and, instead, that SEPs are associated with increased participation in addiction treatment

12 programs. (Lew Decl., 123.) A study published in a 2006 issue of Substance Use & Misuse

13 found compelling evidence that SEPs are effective, safe, and cost-effective. (Lew Decl., 124 &

14 Exh. D.) A study published in the January 2016 issue of AIDS and Behavior found that SEPs

15 lower HIV risk in vulnerable populations. (Lew Decl.,  25 & Exh. E.) In short, there is no merit

16 to petitioners' assertion that "[t]here is no data at all, let alone current data, linking a decrease in

17 prevalence of HCV and HIV to an increase in needle distribution." (See Motion, p. 13.) All of

18 the evidence summarized above proves just the opposite, and establishes that the public will

19 suffer great harm if OCNEP's operations are enjoined.

B.
20 Orange County needs an SEP

21 Orange County continues to experience injection-related HIV transmission, which in 2015

22 included a total of 23 newly-diagnosed cases among people who inject drugs and men who have

23 sex with men and who inject drugs. (Lew Decl.,  26 & Exh. F.) In addition, between 2012 and

24 2016, Orange County's overall rate of new HIV cases increased by 25%, while the statewide rate

25 fell by 6%. (Lew Decl., 1 26 & Exh. F.) Further, Orange County's rate of chronic HCV infection

26 has increased substantially in recent years, with the largest increases among men and women

27 between the ages of 20 and 29. (Lew Decl.,  27 & Exh, G.) Between 2011 and 2015, the overall

28 rate of new HCV diagnoses increased by 201% in Orange County, and the rate of new diagnoses

17
Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (37-2018-00039176-CU-MC-CTL)

- among people between the

2 ages of 20 and 29 increased by more than 1,000%. (Lew Decl., 1 27

3 & Exh. G.) Also, the area encompassed by the zip code in Costa Mesa, where the Department

4 recently authorized OCNEP to operate one of its mobile clinics, experienced drug overdose death

5 rates significantly higher than Orange County as a whole or the statewide average during the year

6 2017. (Lew Decl., 128 & Exh. H.) Finally, Orange County's death rate from opioid overdose

7 was 36% higher than the state average in 2017. (Lew Decl., 129.) Accordingly, the evidence

8 before this Court shows a pressing need for an SEP in Orange County. (Lew Decl., 1 30.)

C.

9 The public will be harmed if the injunction is issued

10 The evidence before this Court demonstrates that preventing OCNEP from operating its
mobile SEP clinics will -

11

12 increase the transmission of HIV and HCV among injection drug users in Orange County,

13 increase the number of deaths in Orange County caused by opioid overdose,

14 increase skin and soft tissue infections among injection drug users in Orange County,

15 increase state and county healthcare costs including emergency department utilization,

16 decrease enrollment of injection drug users in Orange County in substance use disorder

treatment programs,

17

18 decrease access to HIV and HCV testing for injection drug users in Orange County,

19 decrease access to care and treatment for those suffering from HIV and HCV in Orange
County, and

20

21 lessen access to safe places to dispose of used syringes. (See, e.g., Lew Decl., 154.)

22 An injunction that would deny or decrease access to clean syringes, substance use disorder

23 treatments such as Naloxene, safer sex supplies, housing services, and care, treatment, and

24 vaccinations for infectious diseases, would increase the rates of contracting HIV, HCV, and other

25 infections, thereby causing irreparable harm. This harm is far greater and far more tangible than

26 the speculative harm regarding alleged syringe litter of which petitioners complain, and which
will be addressed in the following section in this brief.

27

28

18

Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (37-2018-00039176-CU-MC-CTL)

L D. Petitioners mistakenly assume that OCNEP's current operation will cause
syringe litter 2 Petitioners' arguments regarding the harm to flow if the injunction is not issued are
00 T 1N factually flawed. The key harm of which they complain -- proliferation of used syringes (Motion,
pp. 2-5) - will actually be reduced rather than increased if OCNEP's SEP is allowed to move
forward as approved by the Department. In particular, petitioners spend much of the Motion
complaining that because OCNEP's prior SEP caused large amounts of syringe litter, its current
operation will do the same. Petitioners are mistaken; a significant amount of syringe litter was
8 present in the area where OCNEP previously operated before OCNEP began its operations there
9 in February 2016. By way of background, OCNEP initially began operating at its fixed location
10 in February 2016 at the Santa Ana Civic Center on Saturday afternoons until January 2018, when
11 it was shut down by the City of Santa Ana's decision to deny a permit to it to continue to provide
12 services on property owned by the City in the civic center. (Lew Decl., | 38.) The main concern
13 with OCNEP's operation at the civic center was the amount of syringe litter that was present in
14 the area, which the city incorrectly attributed to OCNEP's operation. (Lew Decl., 1 38.)
15 However, in January 2016, which was a month before OCNEP began operations, a two-day study
16 of syringe litter in the area surrounding the civic center plaza was conducted. (Lew Decl., 1 39.) 17
Volunteers inspected all street, sidewalk, and alleyway areas within the bounds of the plaza, as
18 well as landscaping areas and spaces underneath dumpsters and similar items. (Lew Decl., 1 39.)
19 The study culminated in the collection of 149 syringes. (Lew Decl., 1 39.) And this was before
20 OCNEP ever began its operations. (See Lew Decl., 1 39.) In closing, petitioners erroneously
21 anticipate that OCNEP's current operation will increase syringe litter in Orange County; in
22 reality, significant amounts of syringe litter existed before OCNEP began its initial operations.
23 Moreover, research demonstrates that cities with SEPs have less syringe litter than cities that do
24 not have SEPs, and that syringes from SEPs are more likely to be safely disposed of than those
25 acquired from other sources. (Lew Decl., 1 17.) There is, therefore, little merit to petitioners?
26 contention that OCNEP's current operations will result in a significant amount of syringe litter
27 and thereby cause an adverse environmental impact in Orange County.

P CONCLUSION

2 For these reasons, the Department and its Director respectfully request the Court to deny

3 preliminary injunctive relief to petitioners. Denying the requested injunctive relief will allow
A OCNEP to begin its important public health work in Orange County, for the benefit of all who

5 live and work in the area.

26

27 I, Brian D. Lew, M.A., declare as follows:

28 1. I am currently employed by the Department of Public Health for the State of

Lew Declaration in Support of Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (37-2018-00039176-CU-MC-CTL)

1
California (Department) as the Assistant Division Chief and Acting HIV Prevention Branch Chief
2 in the Department's Office of AIDS, Center for Infectious Diseases. I have worked in the Office
3 of AIDS since 2006. I became the Assistant Division Chief of the Office of AIDS in 2012. Prior
4
to becoming the Assistant Division Chief of the Office of AIDS, I was the Chief of the HIV
5
Prevention Branch within the Department, where I served from 2009 to 2012. Prior to that, I was
6 employed as a manager in several sections within the Office of AIDS.
7
2. The Department's Office of AIDS has lead responsibility for coordinating state
8 programs, services, and activities relating to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and AIDS.
9
The mission of the Office of AIDS is to:
10 Assess, prevent, and interrupt the transmission of HIV and provide for the needs of
11 infected Californians by identifying the scope and extent of HIV infection and the needs
12 which it creates, and by disseminating timely and complete information;
13 Assure high-quality preventive, early intervention, and care services that are appropriate,
14 accessible, and cost effective;
15 Promote the effective use of available resources through research, planning, coordination,
16 and evaluation; and
17 Provide leadership through a collaborative process of policy and program development,
18 implementation, and evaluation.
19
3. As Assistant Division Chief of the Department's Office of AIDS, I oversee the
20 day-to-day operations of the office, which includes overseeing fiscal, policy, legislative, and
21 operational activities for the office.
22
4. As Acting HIV Prevention Branch Chief, I administer HIV prevention activities
23 and programs including HIV testing, biomedical interventions, and syringe services programs.
24
5. directly supervise seven employees and indirectly supervise 28 employees.
25
6. As part of my job duties, I frequently read peer-reviewed journal articles that
26 address topics related to syringe exchange programs (SEPs) and HIV prevention.
27 7. My job duties have compelled me to become intimately familiar with SEPs, which
28

2

Lew Declaration in Support of Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (37-2018-00039176-CU-MC-CTL)

1 are programs that provide sterile needles and syringes and collect used sharps waste from
2 injection drug users with the aim of reducing the spread of HIV, viral hepatitis, and other blood-
3 borne pathogens, "Sharps" are hypodermic needles, pen needles, intravenous needles, lancets,
4
and other devices that are used to penetrate the skin.
5
8. I received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology in 1984 from California State 6 University, Sacramento, and a Master of Arts degree in Clinical Psychology in 1989 from the 7 Professional School of Psychology in San Francisco, California.
8
9. The statements set forth in this declaration are based on my professional
experience in the field of public health, my work experience at the Department, and my review of 10 the documents generated by the Department, and received by the Department, during the course 11 of its review and consideration of the application of Orange County Needle Exchange Program 12 (OCNEP) to operate a mobile SEP in Orange County. If called as a witness, I could and would a 13 testify competently to the matters set forth herein.
14
THE VALUE OF SEPs
15
10. SEPs play a crucial role in preventing the spread of blood-borne pathogens by 16 removing contaminated syringes from circulation.
17
11. "Blood-borne pathogens" are pathogenic microorganisms that are present in
18 human blood, can cause disease in humans, and include but are not limited to the hepatitis B virus
19 (HBV), the hepatitis C virus (HCV), and HIV.
20 12. Not only does syringe re-use increase the risk of spreading HIV, HBV, and HCV, 21 but it also increases the risk of other negative health outcomes, including permanent vein damage, 22 skin and soft tissue infections, and invasive disease caused by pathogens such as staphylococcus 23 and streptococcus group bacteria.
24
13. SEPs have been rigorously studied since they were first introduced in the mid-
25 1980s in response to injection-related HIV transmission.
26
14. The United States Public Health Services recommends that, for those who are
27 unable to stop injection drugs, a new, sterile syringe should be used for each injection.
28

3

Lew Declaration in Support of Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (37-2018-00039176-CU-MC-CTL)

1 15. According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, SEPs

2 reduce HIV and viral hepatitis transmission, reduce overdose mortality, increase entry into

3 substance use disorder treatment, reduce needle-stick injuries, save taxpayer funds, and do not

4 increase drug use or crime.

5 16. The impact of SEPs has been most notable in terms of controlling the HIV

6 epidemic. In particular, between 2008 and 2014, the annual HIV diagnoses among people who

7 inject drugs in the United States fell by half. In jurisdictions where SEPs were adopted early and

8 publicly funded, injection-related HIV transmission has been steeply reduced, such as in San
9 Francisco where the number of infections decreased by two-thirds, and in New York City where
10 HIV prevalence among people who inject drugs fell from 54% in 1990 to 3% in 2012.

11 17. SEPS also play an important role in the safe disposal of used syringes. Studies

12 have found, for example, that cities with SEPs have less syringe litter than cities that do not have

13 SEPs, and that syringes from SEPs are more likely to be safely disposed of than those acquired
14 from other sources.

15 18. Scores of government and professional organizations have endorsed SEPs,

16 including the American Medical Association, the American Nurses Association, the American

17 Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association, the American Public Health

18 Association, the American Society of Addiction Medicine, the United States Centers for Disease

19 Control and Prevention, the United States Conference of Mayors, and the American Bar
20 Association. The California chapters of these medical and public health associations have
21 similarly endorsed sterile syringe exchange as a best practice in HIV prevention.

22 19. SEPs also serve as the main platform for opioid overdose prevention among

23 people at highest risk by training people on prevention, first aid, and distributing the opioid

24 overdose antidote naloxone.

25 20. Evidence proves that SEPs work. For example, a study of the first American SEP,
26 founded in Tacoma, Washington in 1988, found that use of the SEP was associated with a greater
27 than 60% reduction in the risk of contracting HBV or HCV among injection drug users. The
28 study was published in the November 1995 issue of The American Journal of Public Health and

can be accessed via this link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1615682/. A true
2
and correct copy of this article is attached hereto as Exhibit A.
3
21. Another study of over 1,600 injection drug users in New York City in the early 4 1990s found that users who did not participate in an SEP were more than three times as likely to 5 contract HIV as users who participated in the SEP. The study concluded that sterile injection 6 equipment should be legally provided to reduce the risk of HIV infection in persons who inject 7 illegal drugs. The study was published in the October 1996 issue of The Lancet and can be
8 accessed via this link:
9 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8855855. A true and correct copy of a summary of this 10 article is attached hereto as Exhibit B.
11
22. SEPs do more than just improve health. They also save taxpayer money because 12 SEPs are effective and far less expensive than the lifetime cost of treating HIV, HBV, or HCV. A 13 study published in 2014 reinforced the findings of other studies that came before it: A dollar 14 invested in SEPs saves at least six dollars in avoided costs associated with HIV alone. The study 15 was published in the November 2014 issue of AIDS and Behavior and can be accessed via this
16 link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24824043. A true and correct copy of this article is 17
attached hereto as Exhibit C.
18
23. Studies have also shown that SEPs do not promote drug use and do not raise crime 19 levels, and that, instead, SEPs are associated with increased participation in addiction treatment 20
programs.
21
24. A study published in a 2006 issue of Substance Use & Misuse found compelling 22 evidence that SEPs are effective, safe, and cost-effective. The study can be accessed via this link: 23 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16809167.A true and correct copy of a summary of this 24 article is attached hereto as Exhibit D.
25
25. A study published in the January 2016 issue of AIDS and Behavior found that
26 SEPs lower HIV risk in vulnerable populations. The study can be accessed via this link: 27 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26336945.A true and correct copy of this article is 28

ORANGE COUNTY'S NEED FOR AN SEP
3
26. The Department's HIV and HCV surveillance systems show that Orange County 4 continues to experience injection-related HIV transmission, which in 2015 included a total of 23 5 newly diagnosed cases among people who inject drugs and men who have sex with men and who
6 inject drugs. In addition, the Department has found that, between 2012 and 2016, Orange
7 County's overall rate of new HIV cases increased by 25%, while the statewide rate fell by 6%, 8
These findings are detailed in the California HIV Surveillance Report - 2016, which can be

11 IV%20Surveillance%20Report%20-%202016.pdf. A true and correct copy of this report is 12
attached hereto as Exhibit F.
13
27. Further, Orange County's rate of chronic HCV infection has increased 14
substantially in recent years, with the largest increases among men and women between the ages
15 of 20 and 29. Between 2011 and 2015, the overall rate of new HCV diagnoses increased by 16
17 201% in Orange County, and the rate of new diagnoses among people between the ages of 20 and
29 increased by more than 1,000%. These findings are detailed in a report titled, "Orange County 18
- Chronic Hepatitis C: Cases and Rates of Newly Reported Cases, 2011-2015," which can be
19 accessed via this link:
20 https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Converted_Or 21 ange_HCV.pdf. A true and correct copy of this report is attached hereto as Exhibit G. 22
28. In addition, the Department found that the 92627 zip code in Costa Mesa, where 23 OCNEP has been authorized to operate, experienced drug overdose death rates significantly 24 higher than Orange County as a whole or the statewide average during the year 2017. This 25 finding is documented in a report titled, "CDPH Opioid Overdose Surveillance Dashboard," 26 which can be accessed via this link: https://discovery.cdph.ca.gov/CDIC/ODdash/.Atrue and
27 correct copy of this report is attached hereto as Exhibit H.

p 29.

2 According to data collected by the Department, Orange County's death rate from
opioid overdose was 36% higher than the state average in 2017.
3 30.

4 The Department views the above data as evidence of the need for harm reduction
services in the form of an SEP in Orange County.

6 OCNEP'S APPLICATION, PROPOSED OPERATION, AND PRIOR OPERATION

31.

7 The Office of AIDS within the Department operates the Syringe Exchange
Certification Program for the State of California.

8 32.

9 An entity which seeks state authorization to operate an SEP shall, pursuant to

10 Health and Safety Code section 121349, file an application for certification with the Office of
AIDS, through its website or by mail.

11 33.

12 An application must contain all of the information required by California Code of
Regulations, title 17, section 7002, including:

13 a.

14 A showing that the entity provides the following services, directly or by referral: Drug

15 abuse treatment services; HIV or hepatitis screening; hepatitis A and hepatitis B

16 vaccination; screening for sexually transmitted infections; housing services for the

17 homeless, for victims of domestic violence, or other similar housing services; and services

18 aimed at reducing risky sexual behaviors including the distribution of condoms.

19 b. A needs statement that includes information about the presence or absence of other
syringe exchange services in the proposed location.

20

21 c. A description of the proposed syringe exchange services, the anticipated number of

22 participants to be served each year, and the estimated number of syringes to be dispensed
and collected each year.
23 34.

24 OCNEP is a volunteer-run nonprofit corporation, located in Orange County, that

25 provides sterile syringes, HIV and HCV testing, safer sex resources, and safe needle disposal.
35.

26 On January 17, 2018, OCNEP submitted an application to the Department to

27 operate a mobile SEP in four cities in Orange County, California: Santa Ana; Orange; Anaheim;

28 and Costa Mesa. A true and correct copy of OCNEP's application is attached hereto as Exhibit I.

7
Lew Declaration in Support of Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (37-2018-00039176-CU-MC-CTL)

F 36. At the time of its January 2018 application, OCNEP was certified by the
2 Department to provide syringe exchange services at a fixed location at the Santa Ana Civic
3
Center.
4
37. Through its January 2018 application, OCNEP sought to expand its services to
5 other sites by operating in a truly mobile fashion.
6
38. By way of background, OCNEP initially began operating at its fixed location in 7 February 2016 at the Santa Ana Civic Center on Saturday afternoons until January 2018, when it 8 was shut down by the City of Santa Ana's decision to deny a permit to it to continue to provide 9 services at the civic center. One of the primary concerns with OCNEP's operation at the civic 10 center was the amount of syringe litter that was present in the area, which the city wrongly 11
attributed to OCNEP's operation.
12
39. The city's assumption was incorrect because a significant amount of syringe litter 13 was present in the area surrounding the Santa Ana Civic Center before OCNEP initially began 14 operations at the civic center plaza in February 2016. In January 2016, a two-day study of 15 syringe litter in the area surrounding the civic center plaza was conducted. Volunteers inspected 16 all street, sidewalk, and alleyway areas within the bounds of the plaza, as well as landscaping 17 areas and spaces underneath dumpsters and similar items. All syringe litter that was found was 18 collected and properly disposed of. The study culminated in the collection of 149 syringes. 19 OCNEP provided the results of this study to the Office of AIDS.
20
40. As part of its consideration of OCNEP's January 2018 application, the Department 21 identified Orange County as among the California counties most vulnerable to rapid spread of
22 HIV and HCV infections because Orange County had a 201% increase in rates of HCV from 23 2011 to 2015, and the rate of newly-diagnosed HIV cases in Orange County per 100,000 persons
24 in the population increased from 5.2 in 2012 to 6.8 in 2016. Further, an estimated 1% of Orange
25 County residents (or 26,233 people) have an opioid use disorder, and 207 people from Orange 26 County died from opioid overdose in 2017, which represents a rate 36% higher than the
27 California average.
28

8

Lew Declaration in Support of Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (37-2018-00039176-CU-MC-CTL)

- 41.

2 The Department determined that the services proposed to be performed by OCNEP

3 will play a crucial role in preventing the spread of HIV and HCV, and will offer support and
linkage to critical medical care and social services.

4 42.

5 I personally reviewed OCNEP's application and recommended that it be approved

6 because it complied with the governing statutory and regulatory requirements and because data

7 gathered by my staff showed an overwhelming need for an SEP in Orange County,
43. On or about March 27, 2018, the Office of AIDS determined that OCNEP's

8

9 application to operate a mobile SEP was provisionally appropriate. As a result, the Office of

10 AIDS initiated the period of public comment on the application via an announcement on its

11 website. A true and correct copy of this announcement is attached hereto as Exhibit J.
44.

12 During the public comment period, the Department sent e-mail notices of

13 OCNEP's proposed operation to the chiefs of police of the four cities where OCNEP proposed to

14 operate and to the local health officer for Orange County, Dr. Eric Handler. True and correct
copies of these notices are attached hereto as Exhibit K.

15 45.

16 The public comment period on OCNEP's application commenced on March 27,
2018, and ended on June 25, 2018,

17 46.

18 A total of 688 public comments were submitted on OCNEP's application during

19 the 90-day period. Of these, 398 were in opposition, and 290 were in support. During this time

20 period, the Department received letters from the Anaheim Police Department, the Chief of Police

21 for the City of Orange, the City of Costa Mesa Police Department, the Chief of Police for the City

22 of Santa Ana, and the Chairman of the Orange County Board of Supervisors. True and correct
copies of these letters are attached hereto as Exhibit L.

23 47.

24 Also during the public comment period, and in accordance with Health and Safety

25 Code section 121349, the Office of AIDS consulted, via telephone, with the Orange County

26 Health Officer and with law enforcement leadership regarding OCNEP's application.

48.

27 At no time during the public comment period on OCNEP's application did any

28 person or entity contend that the Department was required to comply with the California
Environmental Quality Act during its review and consideration of OCNEP's application.
9

Lew Declaration in Support of Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (37-2018-00039176-CU-MC-CTL)

49. At no time during the public comment period on OCNEP's application did any

2 person or entity contend that OCNEP was required to obtain a local permit to dispose of used
3 syringes it would collect if its application was approved.
0 50. The Department carefully considered all comments that it received on OCNEP's
application during the public comment period and used those comments to inform its decision-
making process.

7 51. On July 27, 2018, Gilberto F. Chavez, M.D., M.P.H., the State Epidemiologist,
8 issued a memorandum to the Director of the Department, recommending approval of OCNEP's
9 application, subject to conditions in order to accommodate the concerns that were conveyed to the
10 Department during its consultation with local law enforcement during the public comment period.
11 The recommended conditions were to narrow the geographic scope of OCNEP's service areas and
to enhance syringe litter recovery efforts. Further, Dr. Chavez's memorandum informs that, as a 12

13 condition of receiving Department authorization to operate its mobile SEP. OCNEP agreed to
14 work with the Orange County Health Care Agency to expand sharps disposal options, operate a
15 hotline and an e-mail address through which to field reports of improperly discarded syringes,
16 develop a map of litter hotspots to inform strategic syringe litter collection, conduct additional
17 syringe recovery services including area sweeps in and around mobile service areas, document
18 concerns and positive feedback expressed by all impacted by the operation, and document steps
19 the program has taken to address the concerns. A true and correct redacted' copy of Dr. Chavez's
20 memorandum is attached hereto as Exhibit M.

21 52. On July 30, 2018, the Director of the Department approved Dr. Chavez's
22 recommendation to approve OCNEP's application with amendments that were based on the
23 recommended conditions.

24 53. Effective August 6, 2018, the Department issued an authorization to OCNEP to
25 operate a mobile SEP at four locations in Orange County, with the amendments approved by the
26 Director. Attached hereto as Exhibit N are true and correct copies of the Department's August 6,
27 One paragraph in the memorandum has been redacted because it contains information
28 that is protected by the attorney-client privilege.

3 54.

4 In my opinion, based on the evidence, preventing OCNEP from operating its

5 mobile SEP clinics will increase the transmission of HIV and HCV among injection drug users in

6 Orange County, will increase the number of deaths in Orange County caused by opioid overdose,

7 will increase skin and soft tissue infections among injection drug users in Orange County, will

8 increase state and county healthcare costs including emergency department utilization, will

9 decrease enrollment of injection drug users in Orange County in substance use disorder treatment

10 programs, will decrease access to HIV and HCV testing for injection drug users in Orange

11 County, will decrease access to care and treatment for those suffering from HIV and HCV in

12 Orange County, and will lessen access to safe places to dispose of used syringes.

HIV incidence among injecting drug users in New York City syringe-exchange programmes

Summary

Background

There have been no studies showing that participation in programmes which provide legal
access to drug-injection equipment leads to individual-level protection against incident HIV
infection. We have compared HIV incidence among injecting drug users participating in syringe-
exchange programmes in New York City with that among non-participants.

Methods

We used meta-analytic techniques to combine HIV incidence data from injecting drug users in
three studies: the Syringe Exchange Evaluation (n=280), in which multiple interviews and saliva
samples were collected from participants at exchange sites; the Vaccine Preparedness Initiative
cohort (n=133 continuing exchangers and 188 non-exchangers, in which participants were
interviewed and tested for HIV every 3 months; and very-high-seroprevalence cities in the
National AIDS Demonstration Research (NADR) programme (n=1029), in which street-recruited
individuals were interviewed and tested for HIV every 6 months. In practice, participants in the NÄDR study had not used syringe exchanges.

Findings

HIV incidence among continuing exchange-users in the Syringe Exchange Evaluation was 1•58
per 100 person-years at risk (95% CI 0-54, 4•65) and among continuing exchange-users in the
Vaccine Preparedness Initiative it was 1•38 per 100 person-years at risk (0•23, 4•57). Incidence
among non-users of the exchange in the Vaccine Preparedness Initiative was 5 26 per 100
person-years at risk (2.41, 11•49), and in the NADR cities, 6•23 per 100 person-years at risk (4•4,
8•6). In a pooled-data, multivariate proportional-hazards analysis, not using the exchanges was
associated with a hazard ratio of 3 35 (95% CI 1•29, 8•65) for incident HIV infection compared
with using the exchanges.

Interpretation

We observed an individual-level protective effect against HIV infection associated with
participation in a syringe-exchange programme. Sterile injection equipment should be legally
provided to reduce the risk of HIV infection in persons who inject illicit drugs.

Abstract Go to:

To examine whether increasing investment in needle/syringe exchange programs (NSPs) in the US
would be cost-effective for HIV prevention, we modeled HIV incidence in hypothetical cases with
higher NSP syringe supply than current levels, and estimated number of infections averted, cost per
infection averted, treatment costs saved, and financial return on investment. We modified Pinkerton's
model, which was an adaptation of Kaplan's simplified needle circulation theory model, to compare
different syringe supply levels, account for syringes from non-NSP sources, and reflect reduction in
syringe sharing and contamination. With an annual $10 to $50 million funding increase, 194-816 HIV
infections would be averted (cost per infection averted $51,601- $61,302). Contrasted with HIV treatment cost savings alone, the rate of financial return on investment would be 7.58 6.38. Main and
sensitivity analyses strongly suggest that it would be cost-saving for the US to invest in syringe
exchange expansion.

Introduction Go to:

HIV infections cause significant human suffering and exact substantial financial costs, with each
infection in the United States estimated to result in a loss of between 9 and 21.1 years of life [1-3],
between 5.33 and 6.433 qualityadjusted life years [2, 3], and $379,668 (2010 dollars) in lifetime
treatment costs [4]. The sharing of drug injection equipment is the second-most common route of HIV
transmission---approximately 9.4 %of new HIV infections in the United States in 2009 occurred among
persons who injected drugs (PWID) and 2.7 % occurred among men who had sex with men and
injected drugs (MSM/PWID) [5].
Access to sterile needles and syringes (herein referred to as "syringes") is a proven approach for
reducing HIV transmission enumerated in the 2010 National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States
[6]. The eyidence in favor of needle/syringe exchange programs (NSP) is well-documented, with

economic evaluations repeatedly showing that NSPs are cost-effective and cost-saving for the
prevention of HIV [7-14]. The 2012 US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)
Blueprint envisions an AIDS-free generation within our lifetime, calling for "smart investments based
on sound science", and establishing NSPs as one of the three central elements of the PEPFAR
comprehensive prevention package for PWID, in addition to community-based outreach programs and
drug treatment [15].
The 2010 National HIV/AIDS Strategy set the objective of reducing the annual number of new HIV
infections by 25 % by year 2015 [6]. This objective was elaborated in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Strategic Plan for 2011-2015 as reducing HIV infections in each of several vulnerable populations including PWID by at least 25 % [16]. Although NSPs may be an essential
strategy for achieving this goal, none of the funds in the CDC HIV prevention budget (approximately
$750 million for fiscal year 2013 [17]) could be used to support NSPs, as federal funding of NSPs has
been banned since 1988 with the exception of a 2-years period from December 2009 to December 2011 [18, 19]. Private donors and state and local governments provided approximately $24 million in 2009 to support over 200 NSPs in the US [20]. Despite these local efforts to reduce injections with non-sterile
syringes, NSP syringe coverage in the US remains low. Tempalski et al. [21] found that the number of
sterile syringes from NSPs in 35 in large metropolitan areas was equal to only about 3 % of the number of
drug injections. Although new syringes are also obtained through pharmacies and other means, there is
evidence to suggest that the vast majority of drug injections are with syringes that are not new [22, 23].
No single intervention will be sufficient for reaching the goal of an AIDS-free generation, but scaling up NSPs may be an important component for reducing HIV infections among PWID. What benefits
might be realized through increased investment in NSPs? What would be the costsavings or cost-
effectiveness of different levels of investment? The answers to these questions are essential for
informing national policy development and funding decisions, but to our knowledge no previous study
has estimated the potential costs and benefits of increasing investment in NSPs in the US.
NSPS are diverse in the range of services they provide. The key component shared across programs is
syringe exchange, which increases access to sterile syringes and speeds up removal of used and
potentially HIV-contaminated syringes from circulation, thereby reducing HIV transmission through
shared syringes. In addition to this key component, many NSPs provide additional services such as
referrals to drug treatment programs, HIV testing and counseling, and condom distribution [24], which
have other possible direct and indirect benefits: changing social norms among PWID towards safer
injecting, facilitating entry into drug treatment and cessation of drug use, increasing condom use,
increasing testing and treatment of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STI) leading to lower
HIV viral load and infectivity, increasing testing, treatment and vaccination for hepatitis viruses, and
reducing drug overdoses.
The present study aimed to estimate the impact on HIV transmission of hypothetical increases in
syringe exchange investment. Its focus is the impact of the most essential component of NSPs:
increasing access to sterile syringes and faster removal of used syringes. With this purpose, our analysis
took into consideration the costs associated specifically with the supply and exchange of syringes, and
its impact on syringe sharing and syringe contamination, and based on which estimated the number of
HIV infections averted and HIV treatment costs avoided. The method was mathematical modeling
using existing data. We applied with modification the model that Pinkerton [13] used to evaluate
Vancouver's Insite program, which was an adaptation from Kaplan's simplified needle circulation
theory model [25-27].
The impacts of the additional NSP services listed above are outside the scope of this paper. To evaluate their costeffectiveness, other modeling approaches would be needed, and additional research would be
required to generate the data needed for modeling inputs.

Methods Go to:

From existing data, we derived estimates for the current situation in the US: the number of syringes
supplied by NSPs in a year and the number of people who contract HIV due to drug injecting risk in a
year. The key question is if NSP syringe supply were increased by a certain amount, what would
happen to the number of people contracting HIV--it is expected to go down, but by how much. If we
could answer this question, we could evaluate the costeffectiveness of such hypothetical increase in
it NSP syringe supply by costing it and estimating savings resulting from infections averted.

The Model

The strategy for answering this question is to start from an equation for the number of new HIV
infections due to injection drug use over a 1-year period, and to relate parameters in this equation to
syringe supply, Such equation would allow us to estimate how a hypothetical increase in syringe supply in
would affect the number of new infections.

The initial equation is based on the premise that the number of new infections in a year equals the
number of uninfected (thus at risk) persons times the probability that an uninfected person becomes
infected over the course of the year. It is:

I=N(1 - a) Bcy.

I is the number of new HIV infections due to drug injecting risk in the US in a year. N is the number of
PWID in the US and a is HIV prevalence among PWID, therefore N (1 - a) is the number of
uninfected PWID who are at risk of contracting HIV. The product Bey is an approximation for the probability that an uninfected PWID becomes infected in the year, with B being the average number of
times a PWID injects drugs with a receptively shared syringe (or number of "borrows") in a year, e
being the proportion of shared syringes that are contaminated with HIV, and y representing the probability of getting infected through one injection with an HIV-contaminated syringe. The probability
y averages risk over the heterogeneity of syringe contamination including variation in blood amount and
variation in viral load in the blood -the latter being a mixture of low levels (from HIV-positive persons
who have viral suppression as a result of antiretroviral treatment) and high levels (from those without
viral suppression).
We use these notations to refer to parameters in the current situation, or the status quo, which we call
the base case. In a hypothetical case with increased NSP syringe supply, the number of new HIV
infections due to injection risk in a year is denoted by I'. The number of borrows and the contaminated
proportion are expected to decrease as a result of increased syringe supply; we denote them with B' and
c'. The other parameters N, a and y are conservatively assumed to stay the same. As such,

I'=N(1-a)B'cy.

We are interested in estimating number of infections averted as a result of increasing syringe supply (A
= I - 1). It is more tractable, however, to compare /'to / using the ratio:

I'I=N(1-a)B'c'yN(1-a)Bcy=B'B-c'c.

Once /'/I has been worked out, the number of infections averted can be estimated:

A=I-I'=I(1-I'T).

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4211599/ 8/28/2018

Syringe Exchange in the United States: A National Level Economic Evaluation of Hypoth... Page 4 of 18

To estimate the ratio of syringe contamination proportions (c/), we applied Kaplan's simplified needle
circulation theory model [25-27], which was adapted and used by Pinkerton in his evaluation of
Vancouver's InSite program [13]. Based on this model, the proportion of syringes that are contaminated
is proportional to the rate at which syringes become contaminated, which in turn is proportional to the
ratio of the number of injections with a borrowed syringe to the number of injections with either a new
or borrowed syringe. Thus:

c'c=B'(B+S)B(B+S)

where S and S' denote the number injections with brand new syringes per PWID per year, in the base
case and in the hypothetical case.
Results from the needle circulation theory are based on an average 1-to-1 exchange assumption; greater
exchange ratios (more dirty syringes for a new one) would result in greater reduction in contamination.
While programs vary in exchange policies and may not rigorously enforce 1-to-1 exchange, the overall
result is close to 1-to-1 exchange and the assumption holds for our calculations. Data on syringes
distributed by and returned to NSPs (available from the North American Syringe Exchange Network
[20]), and discounting for syringes being unused/lost and for NSP syringes replacing the use of syringes
from other sources (see details about such discounting below), point to an effective ratio of 1 new
syringe for 1.04 or 1.06 old syringes (for 2009 and 2008).
From the contamination ratio above, it follows that

I'I=B'B•c'c=B'B•B'(B'+S')B/(B+S)=(B'B)2•B+SB'+S'.

The infections ratio thus depends on base case and hypothetical case values of two parameters: (1) the
number of injections with new syringes per PWID per year, which is also the average number of new
syringes used by a PWID per year; and (2) the number of borrows per PWID per year. The question is
how these two parameters would change as a result of an increase in NSP syringe supply.
First, the average number of new syringes a PWID uses in a year (S) is a combination of syringes from
NSPs (SNSP) and syringes from other sources (SHOHNSP). Of the total volume of syringes supplied by
NSPs to PWID in the US over 1 year (VNSP), we assume that a certain proportion (w) go unused, and
the average number of new NSP syringes used by PWID in a year is:

SNSP-VNSP(1-w)N.

With an increase in NSP syringe supply of AV NSP, the number of new NSP syringes used per PWID per
year is increased by:

SNSP'-SNSP=AVNSP(1-w)N.

We assume also that as NSP syringe supply increases, a proportion (r) of the additional NSP syringes would replace syringes that otherwise would have been obtained from non-NSP sources, such that:

SnonNSP'-SnonNSP=-r(SNSP'-SNSP)=-AVNSP(1-w)rN.

Summing each side of the two equations above, we have:

S'-S=AVNSPN(1-w)(1-r).

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4211599/ 8/28/2018

Syringe Exchange in the United States: A National Level Economic Evaluation of Hypoth... Page 5 of 18

Let f denote (1 -w) (1 -r), representing a discount for both the NSP syringes that would go unused and the replacement of non-NSP syringes, and name it the "supply increase discount factor". The hypothetical case number of syringes used per PWID per year is:

S'-S+AVNSPNf.

Second, how would an increase in NSP syringe supply affect the number of borrows (B)? While the
number of injections per PWID per year (M) is expected to remain the same, the number of injections
with a new syringe per PWID per year (S) would increase with increased NSP syringe supply. The
number of injections with a syringe that is not new ("non-new" injections, for short), which is (M - S), would go down, and this number includes injections with borrowed syringes (B) and injections with reused syringes. To our knowledge, no previous study has examined the relationship between S and B.
Our own exploratory analysis of site level data from the NIDA Cooperative Research Evaluation Study indicated that proportions of non-new injections that occurred with borrowed syringes were independent of proportions of injections with new syringes. We assume that the proportion of non-new injections that occur with borrowed syringes (B/(M S)) would remain constant:

BM-S=B'M-S'.

This implies a reduction in the number of borrows:

B'=B(M-S'M-S).

Finally, by supplying estimates (based on existing data and assumptions) for the number of PWID in the US (N), annual number of new HIV infections due to injection risk (I), per-PWID per-year numbers
of injections (M), injections with a new syringe (S), and injections with a borrowed syringe (B), and the supply increase discount factor (f), the number of HIV infections averted with increased NSP syringe supply can in be estimated. For a given increase in NSP syringe volume ((AV NSP)), the number of HIV
infections averted is:

A=I(1-I'T)=I[1-(B'B)2•B+SB+S']

where

B'=B(M-S'M-S)andS'-S+AVNSPNf.

Computations
Calculations started with levels of hypothetical additional investment, which we set to range from zero
to 50 million US dollars (in 2011 currency). Dividing the additional investment by the estimated cost per NSP syringe distributed (U) provided an estimate of the increase in US NSP syringe supply AVNSP, from which the number of infections averted (A) was calculated. HIV treatment costs avoided as a
result of averting those infections were derived by multiplying the number of infections averted by the estimated per person lifetime HIV treatment cost (T), which was represented in net present value (i.e., discounting future costs to present time), so that these savings could be compared to investment,

Parameter Values
The model requires the specification of several parameters, with values drawn from or estimated based
on existing data. Where there was uncertainty about a value, a range of credible values was examined

the least favorable values on all parameters. These parameter values, their basis/sources and the value

Number of new HIV infections due to drug injection risk in the US per year in the base case (I) = 2,575 infections. HIV incidence estimates available for the most recent year (2009) served as the basis for our
analysis, with 4,500 new HIV infections acquired by PWID and 1,300 by MSM/PWID [S]. For this
analysis, only infections due to drug injection risk are of interest, and existing research suggests that
HIV sexual transmission among PWID is common. Male PWID who engage in homosexual activity are
more likely to become infected [28-30]. Female PWID who have a drug-injecting sex partner, have had
an STI [30], or engage in prostitution [28] are more likely to become infected. Findings from studies
comparing the sexual risk of PWID and people who use non-injecting drugs are mixed: one found less
sexual risk among PWID [30], another found comparable risk [31].
A recent study with 337 PWID in New York City [32] found a significant association between HSV-2
and HIV infection and no association between HCV and HIV infection, and thus concluded that most
HIV infections in this sample occurred through sexual transmission. While New York City is one of the
cities in the US most active in meeting PWID's safe injection needs and therefore may have less
parenteral transmission than in other areas, this finding suggests generally that in settings where
interventions to reduce parenteral transmission are effective, sexual transmission may account for
large part of HIV infections among PWID.
Given the lack of precise estimates, we assumed that 50 % of the infections in the PWID category and
25 % of the infections in the MSM/PWID category were due to injection risk-a total of 2,575
infections in 2009-and used this as the base case number of new HIV infections due to injection risk
per year. To address the uncertainty of these proportions, we conducted sensitivity analysis on the
range of 2,060-3,090 infections (corresponding to 40-60 % of PWID category and 20-30 % of
MSM/PWID category).
Number of persons who injected drugs in the past year in the US (N) = 1.55 million. Using anchor
PWID population estimates of 1.75 million in 1992 [33] and 1.35 million in 1998 [34], Brady et al.
estimated the size of the US PWID population for the period of 1992-2002 based on drug treatment,
HIV testing and AIDS diagnosis data, and validated their estimates through correlations with unemployment rate, hepatitis C mortality and poisoning mortality [35]. Their analysis suggests that the PWID population was relatively stable between 1992 and 2002, and the average PWID population over
is this period was about 1.55 million. Since this is the most rigorous PWID population estimation to date,
we used this estimate as a basis for our analysis. There is significant uncertainty around this population
size, however. An analysis of selfreporting data from several household surveys- -which were likely to
miss people who are homeless, without stable housing, or in residential treatment, and to suffer from
under-reporting due to the behavior's sensitivity-provided a much lower estimate of nearly 760
thousand PWID in 2009 [36]. On the other hand, a review of the global epidemiology of injection drug use and HIV listed for the US an PWID population of 1.86 million, calculated based on experts' reports
[37]. Our sensitivity analyses thus examined a range of 0.76-1.86 million.
Number of injections per PWID per year (M) = 812.02 injections. This estimate assumed a mean of 2.8
injections per day, based on two main sources. Using data from the NIDA Cooperative Research
Evaluation Study, Lurie et al. [38] estimated 2.8 injections per PWID per day for 1996. Based on a
review of the literature and consultation with various experts, Tempalski et al. [21] arrived at the same
estimate of 2.8 injections per PWID per day in 2000. This is equivalent to 1,022.7 injections over a year
of 365.25 days. However, not every PWID injects for the whole year. Galai et al. [39] tracked how
PWID in Baltimore moved in and out of drug injecting. Using data from their paper, we found that people in this sample were injecting drugs for only 79.4 % of the time they would be classified as past-

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4211599/ 8/28/2018

Syringe Exchange in the United States: A National Level Economic Evaluation of Hypoth... Page 8 of 18

year injectors. This means on average, each PWID had 1,022.7 injections * 79.4 % = 812.02 injections
per year. Sensitivity analyses examined a range of 720-900 injections.
Number of borrows per PWID per year in the base case (B) = 81.20 borrows. This was based on an
estimate of the proportion of injections that occur with borrowed syringes, out of all injections.
Pinkerton estimated this proportion to be 0.083 in Vancouver, by multiplying the proportion of PWID
who borrowed with the proportion of injections by those who borrowed that were with borrowed
syringes [13]. To estimate this proportion for the US, we used data from the NIDA Cooperative Research Evaluation Study, presented in an early paper by McCoy et al. [40]. Of 12,323 active PWID recruited from 19 sites, 31.9 % reported sharing both syringes and drug preparation tools in the past 30 days; another 8.6 % reported sharing syringes only. Those in the first group reported using syringes
previously used by another PWID on average 29.4 times in the past 30 days; those in the second group
reported 14.1 times. Combining this with the injection frequency of 2.8 times per PWID per day, we
could estimate borrowing = (31.9 % 29.4 times + 8.6 % * 14.1 times)/(30 days 2.8 times) = 12.6 %,
The NIDA study is dated, however. One could expect borrowing behavior to have declined over time as
a result of HIV prevention efforts. To incorporate this expectation, instead of 12.6 %, we used 10 %,
and arrived at number of borrows = 812.02 injections * 10 % = 81.20 borrows, Sensitivity analyses
examined a range of 64.96-105.56 borrows (corresponding to 8-13 % of injections).
Number of brand new syringes used per PWID per year in the base case (S) = 146.16 syringes. Apart
from injections that happen with borrowed syringes, the rest (M - B 730.82 injections) occur with
syringes PWID owns (or "own syringes", for short). This number, divided by the number of injections
per own syringe, would give the number of brand new syringes a PWID uses per year (S). Estimates of
the number of injections per own syringe are available from several sources. Heimer et al. [41] studied
the number of injections per syringe among NSP clients in four cities in the early and mid 1990s. With
the implementation of NSP, they found that the mean number of injections per syringe in Chicago
decreased from a mean of 6.83 (median 5) before the start a of NSPs to a mean of 1.4 (median 1) after,
and in Baltimore decreased from 12.4 (median 6) to 3.6 (median 2). In New Haven, the number of
injections per syringe decreased from 7.14 to 3.97 when individuals began using an NSP Using data
collected between 1997 and 2000 in Chicago, Huo and Oullet found that the median number of
injections per own syringe among PWID who reused their syringes was 3 for NSP users and 5 for non-
users [22]; including PWID who did not reuse any syringes in their analyses would have resulted in
medians that were lower. Given the range of available values above, we assumed that on average a
PWID in the US uses syringe he/she owns for five injections. Thus the number of brand new syringes a PWID uses in year is 730.82 injections/5 injections per syringe = 146.16 syringes. Sensitivity analyses examined a range of 104.40-182.71 syringes (corresponding to 7-4 injections per own
syringe).
Supply increase discount factor(f) = 0.855. This was based on an assumption of 5 % NSP syringes
going unused, and 10 % of the increased NSP syringe supply replacing non-NSP syringes. As no data
are currently available to suggest what these proportions should be, these estimates were based on
author consensus. Sensitivity analyses examined an frange of 0.8-0.9.
NSP unit cost (U) = $0.48 per syringe. The Beth Israel Medical Center/North American Syringe
Exchange Network (NASEN) Survey provides information on the budgets of and number of syringes
distributed by NSPs in the US. However, these programs provide a number of services beyond syringe
distribution, while our analysis focused on the costs and benefits of increased syringe supply. For this purpose we estimated programmatic costs for a minimal set of services including syringe exchange, referrals to off-site services and no more than one additional on-site service such as HIV testing or
condom distribution. Analysis of costs data reported to the NASEN survey by programs that provide
such level of service gives an average cost of $0.48 per syringe (in 2011 USD).

Lifetime HIV treatment cost per infected person (T) = $391,223 (in 2011 USD). The CDC published
that on average, the lifetime treatment cost of an HIV positive case, discounted to net present value,
was $379,668 in 2010 USD [4]. Adjusted for inflation in medical care costs, this is equivalent to is
$391,223 in 2011 USD.

Results Go to:

In the base case scenario with no additional syringe exchange funding, an estimated 2,575 HIV
infections occur in a year due to drug injection risk. Based on lifetime treatment costs of $391,223 in
2011 USD per infection, the total treatment costs for these infections is $1.01 billion.

present value

Based on the model and parameter estimates, an additional $10 million investment for NSPs providing a minimal set of services in a year would avert 194 HIV infections and result in treatment cost savings
of $75.8 million. A $50 million increase in funding would avert 816 infections and save $319.1 million
in treatment costs. The cost per infection averted would range from $51,601 (in case of $10 million
additional investment) to $61,302 (in case of $50 million additional investment). This corresponds to a
rate financial return of investment of 7.58 to in the former case and 6.38 to in the latter case.

The US National HIV/AIDS Strategy specified a goal of 25 % HIV incidence reduction. Based on our
model, to reduce by 25 % the number of HIV infections among PWID attributable to injection risk that
occur in a year, an increase in annual NSP funding of slightly less than $40 million would be needed.
Figure 2 presents the findings of sensitivity analyses with two outputs, the number of infections averted
(top panel) and net savings (bottom panel). The uncertainty in three parameters, B (injections with a borrowed syringe), S (injections with a new syringe) and f (discount factor for syringe supply increase) caused minimal change in modeling results. Variations in M (injections per PWID per year) and U (cost
per syringe distributed) corresponded to slightly bigger changes, and variations in (HIV incidence)
caused the most substantial change. The low value for N (number of PWID) resulted in very high
estimates of infections averted. Over all these sensitivity analyses, the conclusion that additional
investment in syringe exchange would be highly cost-saving does not change.

Sensitivity analyses with higher/lower values on each parameter + combining all least favorable values

In the worst-case scenario sensitivity analysis, the least favorable values of all the seven parameters
were combined (Fig. 2). Under this scenario, an investment increase of $10 million would avert 99
infections, save $38.76 million in HIV treatment costs, and represent a rate of financial return on
investment of 3.88-1. An investment increase of $50 million would avert 445 infections, save $173.97
million in HIV treatment costs, and represent a rate of return on investment of 3.48 to 1. Even in this
worst-case scenario, additional investment in syringe exchange would be highly cost-saving.

Go to: Discussion
These analyses indicate that it would be highly cost-saving to invest additional funds to expand syringe
exchange services in the US. Over the course of 1 year an additional investment of only $10 million would avert an estimated 194 HIV infections and avoid $75.8 million in lifetime HIV treatment costs
(saving $65.8 million net), representing a rate of financial return on investment of 7.58. If the
investment increase were $50 million, it would also be highly cost-saving: approximately 816 HIV
infections would be averted, equivalent to nearly one-third to (32 %) of the annual number of new HIV
infections due to drug injection risk; $319.1 million of lifetime HIV treatment costs would be avoided
(net savings $269.1 million), representing a 6.38 rate of financial return on investment. Sensitivity
analyses showed that when uncertainties about parameter values were accounted for, investment
increase remained highly cost-saving.
Our analyses were conservative in scope, focusing on the effects of increased NSP syringe supply in
terms of reducing number of injections with borrowed syringes and reducing HIV contamination of syringes in circulation. We did not account for the impacts of other services provided by NSPs on HIV
transmission, such as referrals for drug treatment which may reduce the number of PWID at risk for
HIV, HIV testing and counseling which may reduce risk behavior and lead to earlier initiation of HIV
treatment and reduced infectivity, condom distribution which may reduce sexual transmission among

PWID and their sex partners, etc.; and did not account for reductions in secondary HIV infections. We
also did not estimate benefits of increased NSP syringe supply on hepatitis C infections. In calculating
return on investment, our study was also conservative in including only savings in HIV treatment costs,
without estimating the additional social and economic costs avoided, or assigning a monetary value to
the lives and life years saved.
As the scope of our study was restricted to the costeffectiveness of increased syringe supply (the most
essential component of NSPs), we estimated programmatic costs associated with a minimal set of
services. This level of cost ($0.48 per syringe) allows for what is offered by the leanest programs: the
exchange of syringes plus referrals to off-site services and no more than one additional on-site service.
As such, our study did not estimate the benefits of services beyond syringe exchange. If instead of this
$0.48 per syringe we used the average cost from.all NSPs surveyed by NASEN including programs
with more comprehensive services (which if divided by the syringe volume would be about $0.72),
even without accounting for the additional benefits of the broader range of services, this would still lead
to the conclusion that increased investment would be highly cost-saving,
is That is not to say to that the other effects of NSP services should be neglected. They represent a gap in the
syringe exchange literature, so their magnitudes are not known. No study has estimated, for example,
NSPs' potential effect on the HIV treatment cascade, from increased counseling and testing, to earlier treatment initiation, to viral suppression, to reduced infectivity, even though it has been established that
carly treatment [42] and viral suppression [43] reduces infectivity and sexual transmission. To estimate such effect requires data that causally link NSP attendance to earlier initiation of HIV treatment, which
currently do not exist. As more data become available on the various effects of NSPs, cost-effectiveness
analyses should incorporate them so that the impacts of NSPs could be captured fully and the package of NSP-related services could be tailored to optimize the cost-benefit tradeoff.
Two parameters in our model-HIV prevalence and the average infectivity of an HIV-contaminated
syringe---were conservatively assumed to be the same in the hypothetical case as well as the base case,
while theoretically, they could go down over time in the hypothetical case, relative to the base case,
Higher syringe supply means fewer new infections, which could make prevalence in the hypothetical
case lower than in the base case. NSP attendance could lead to earlier HIV testing and treatment
initiation, which would reduce the amount of virus contaminating syringes, lowering the overall
infectivity of syringes. Since the short (1-year) time frame being considered means these effects would likely be very small, and due to lack of estimates for them, we excluded them from this analysis. These
effects, however, could not be ignored in studies that project HIV incidence over several or more years
into the future.

One unconservative aspect of our model is that it does not address the competing risk of sexual
transmission. The individuals who avoided injection-related infections in the hypothetical case would
remain in the pool of people at risk for infection through sex. If we applied the population average
sexual transmission rate among PWID (based on the data on new infections and PWID population size
used in this study), out of the 194 persons who avoid injectionrelated infections in the $10-million-
investment-increase scenario, we would expect 0.21 persons to become infected sexually; out of the
816 persons in the $50-millioninvestment-increase scenario, we would expect 0.88 persons to become
infected sexually; both of these are small numbers. This, however, assumes no correlation between
sexual and parenteral transmission risks, but it is difficult to estimate the correlation of these risks and
the relevant sexual transmission incidence rate for these individuals. We have thus excluded this detail
from our analysis. When more data are available on risk correlation, this issue should be revisited. On
the other hand, NSPs typically provide HIV testing and condoms, both of which may be associated with
reduction of sexual risk behavior. Thus, expansion of NSPs may actually be associated with reduced

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4211599/ 8/28/2018

sexual transmission. As we believe that this effect would be small within a 1-year time frame, and do not have the data needed to estimate this effect, we have not included it in the model.
It should be mentioned that the model we used in this analysis is a relatively simple model that requires
a small number of parameters. This was deemed suited for a national level analysis, because of limited
data availability and our hesitation to make too many assumptions. In other words, the gain in big
picture comes with a certain loss in resolution. In local level analyses, other researchers have used more
complex models. For example, Vickerman et al, incorporated estimates of PWID who do not share
syringes or have different levels of sharing and injection network characteristics [44, 45]. Bobashev et
al. [46] proposed agent-based models that allow simulating HIV transmission under different NSP
syringe coverage scenarios. For our purpose of national level analysis, data were too sparse to allow
reasonable assumptions about individual PWID behaviors and their injection networks to use any of
these complex models.
The quality of a cost-effectiveness analysis depends on the quality of the data that inform the values of
modeling parameters, As our analysis was at the national level, we were able to draw from data from
different national and local studies for different parameters. Many of the parameters, however, were
estimated from either older data from national studies or more contemporaneous data from localized
studies, which may or may not accurately reflect contemporary national epidemiology of HIV and
injection practices among PWID. There was uncertainty about quite few parameters, such as the size
of the PWID population, HIV incidence due to injection drug to use, sharing/borrowing practices, number
of injections per syringe, and the quantity of non-NSP syringes.
To address these issues, we relied on multiple data sources to reduce bias and conducted sensitivity
analyses covering ranges of plausible parameter values to account for the uncertainty in each parameter.
Even when the least favorable values of all these parameters were combined, the results indicated
substantial cost savings, making it clear that the conclusion about increased syringe exchange funding
being highly cost-saving is robust to uncertainties in parameter values. When more precise data for the
parameters in this model become available, updating the analysis may provide more accurate estimation
of the degree of effectiveness of syringe exchange expansion.
A feature of the model that should be mentioned is that it is an average model that assumes parameter
values are similar across different geographical locations in the United States. To be precise, it assumes
that the ratio of new infections in the hypothetical case to the base case (I'/I) is the same (or similar),
which means B, c (and B', c') are similar, in different parts of the country. This is an inaccurate
assumption but was necessary for the model to be estimated, because data on B (number of borrows)
were not widely available. While we produced one estimate of costeffectiveness for the country based
on this average model, for funding decisions, we would like to highlight that if investment increase
were to be targeted, it would be more cost-effective and cost-saving in areas where syringe coverage is
lower and borrowing is more prevalent (higher B than average, which means increased syringe supply
will displace more borrows, leading to a smaller I'/I ratio), and where HIV incidence is high (higher 1
for PWID population than average), as these conditions combined give rise to a larger number of
infections averted (I - I). Local NSP cost is also an important factor-in areas where NSP operating costs are lower, investment increase would be more cost-effective.
To inform local funding decisions, it would be even better to have local analyses, especially in areas
where injecting drug use, HIV among PWID, and syringe exchange have been extensively researched,
and local data are thus availäble for model parameters (for an example about how such data could be
used for local analysis, see the spreadsheet available online as supplemental material). Data availability may even allow the consideration of one or more of the more complex models mentioned above.

Conclusions

With an estimated total syringe coverage of about 18 % of drug injections (including 2.8 % coverage by
NSPs), there is tremendous unmet need for clean syringes among PWID in the US. From in a public
health perspective, more investment is needed for syringe exchange, to avert infections and save lives.
From a financial management perspective, in a time of difficult economic conditions constricting
resources for public spending, it is especially important to invest in interventions that are effective and
cost-effective. Investment in syringe exchange not only meets these two criteria but also would save
more resources than what needs to be spent. Given that about three-fourths of HIV treatment costs in
the US are borne by the public sector [47], expanding syringe exchange could contribute to reducing the
country's public budget deficit in the long run. These are important factors that US policy makers
should consider in deciding whether or not to support expansion of syringe exchange.

Do needle syringe programs reduce HIV infection among
injecting drug users: a comprehensive review of the
international evidence.

Wodak A1, Cooney A.
Author information

Abstract
This first international review of the evidence that needle syringe programs reduce HIV
infection among injecting drug users found that conservative interpretation of the published
data fulfills six of the nine Bradford Hill criteria (strength of association, replication of
findings, temporal sequence, biological plausibility, coherence of evidence, and reasoning
by analogy) and all six additional criteria (cost-effectiveness, absence of negative
consequences, feasibility of implementation, expansion and coverage, unanticipated
benefits, and application to special populations). The Bradford Hill criteria are often used to
evaluate public health interventions. The principal finding of this review was that there is
compelling evidence of effectiveness, safety, and cost-effectiveness, consistent with seven
previous reviews conducted by or on behalf of U.S. government agencies. Authorities in
countries affected or threatened by HIV infection among injecting drug users should
carefully consider this convincing evidence now available for needle syringe programs with
a view to establishing or expanding needle syringe programs to scale.

Abstract Go to:

Syringe exchange programs (SEPs) lower HIV risk. From 1998 to 2007, Congress prohibited
Washington, DC, from using municipal revenue for SEPs. We examined the impact of policy change on
IDU-associated HIV cases. We used surveillance data for new IDU-associated HIV cases between
September 1996 and December 2011 to build an ARIMA model and forecasted the expected number of
IDU-associated cases in the 24 months following policy change. Interrupted time series analyses
(ITSA) were used to assess epidemic impact of policy change. There were 176 IDU-associated HIV
cases in the 2 years post-policy change; our model predicted 296 IDU-associated HIV cases had the
policy remained in place, yielding a difference of 120 averted HIV cases. ITSA identified significant
immediate (B = -6.0355, p = .0005) and slope changes (B = -.1241, p = .0427) attributed to policy
change. Policy change is an effective structural intervention for HIV prevention when it facilitates the
implementation of services needed by vulnerable populations.

Introduction Go to:

The District of Columbia (DC) is in the midst of significant HIV/AIDS epidemic [1]. According to
epidemiological data from the end of 2011, approximately 2.4 % of DC residents over the age of
12 years are living with HIV/AIDS [L]. Injection drug use (IDU) accounts for 14.2 % of the living cases
of HIV/AIDS in the District [1]. HIV transmission through IDU disproportionately affects women and
African-Americans, and the problem is most common in Washington's most economically
disadvantaged areas. Among African Americans, IDU is the third leading mode of transmission overall
and the second leading mode of transmission among women [1].
The scientific community has put increased attention on the need for interventions that better address
the social drivers of HIV risk [2]. Structural interventions refer to policies and programs that change
environments in which health risk occurs, but without attempting to change the knowledge, attitudes, or
other social interactions of persons at risk [3]. Syringe exchange is an example of a structural

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4715855/ 8/28/2018

interyention that could have a tremendous impact on HIV prevention among people who inject drugs
(PWID).
Needle and syringe exchange programs (SEPs) (henceforth referred to as "syringe exchange" or SEP)
are among the simplest HIV prevention interventions for PWID, and there is copious evidence of its
effectiveness both domestically and globally [4]. Expanded access to sterile injection
equipment-particularly through SEP---has led to decreased needle sharing among PWID and reduced
HIV incidence and prevalence [4-6], and is not associated with increased crime rates or increased illicit
drug use [Z]. Modeling studies have shown that widespread syringe access to active PWID for HIV
prevention has societal benefit and costs less than the estimated lifetime medical costs if those persons
were to become HIV-infected through shared injection equipment [8].

Challenges in Implementing Structural Interventions
Historically, the allocation of municipal, state, or federal-level funding for any public health
intervention (including SEP) is a decision governed by policy makers. Existing laws must allow for the
utilization of funds in a manner that best addresses public health needs (e.g., supporting programs).
Changes in legislation may be required before such structural interventions can be implemented. These
policy changesincluding the inclusion of seat belts in automobiles, implementation of smoke-free
ordinances in buildings and public areas, and increases in alcohol taxation-have been associated with
significant improvements in population level health [2-11].
Changing legislation for public health benefit is neither simple [12] nor does it happen with any
consistency or frequency. In some cases, there may be a clear relationship between the source of law
and its jurisdictional application (e.g., citywide smoking bans in restaurants that are limited to a specific geographic jurisdiction). In other instances, the relationships are not clear and may involve a
combination of federal, state, and local laws. The DC has a particularly interesting legislative status
because it is not recognized as a state and, therefore, does not have the same autonomy as other states in
the Union. Instead, both Federal and local-level legislation govern DC, and it is this disconnect between
Federal policy and city-level public health needs that has fueled the HIV prevention struggle for the
District's PWID.
In 1998, the United States Congress included language in the Financial Services Appropriations Bill
proscribing the use of federal funds for SEP. While this legislation did not affect states and localities
that wanted to use locally generated revenue, it did affect the DC because of Congress' oversight of the
city's budget and operations through the Financial Services legislation. Thus, while the DC had a
significant PWID population in need of HIV prevention services, it was the only city in the US
prohibited from using municipal revenue to support syringe access. This legislative restriction became
known as the "DC Ban". Prevention Works, a community-based organization (CBO) supported through
private donations and grants from non-governmental charitable foundations, operated the only SEP in the city. With the ban in place, Prevention Works was limited in its ability to secure enough funding to
operate a program in a city that, at that time, had a generalized HIV prevalence of 3.0 % [13].
In December 2007, President George W. Bush signed the 2008 Financial Services Bill (HR 2764) into
law. This version of the bill did not contain language prohibiting the use of locally generated revenue to
support syringe access in the DC, thereby removing the DC Ban. Then-Mayor Adrian Fenty allocated
$650,000 to the DC Department of Health to create the DC NEX, a program supporting several CBOs
in delivering a minimum harm reduction package that includes syringe exchange, provision of
condoms, referrals to HIV testing and addiction treatment, and harm reduction information [14].
The removal of the DC Ban is an instance in which a natural policy intervention occurred. The purpose
of this study is to examine the impact of this policy change in Washington, DC, on IDU-associated HIV

cases. Analyses were conducted to examine the actual number of new IDU-associated HIV cases
observed in DC following the removal of the DC Ban and comparing it to the estimated number of
infections that would have occurred had the ban remained in place. We then conducted a time series
analysis to assess for changes in the numbers of pre- and post- policy change cases of IDU-associated
HIV infection. We hypothesize that the lifting of the DC Ban will result in significant impact on HIV
cases in DC attributable to IDU-exposure.

Methods Go to:

The impact of the removal of the DC Ban was examined in two ways. Using autoregressive integrated
moving averages (ARIMA) modeling, we first forecasted the expected number of IDU-associated HIV
cases if the DC ban had remained in place and compared those to the observed number of IDU-
associated HIV cases in the 24-months following the policy change. Subsequently, we used interrupted
time series analysis (ITSA) to investigate significant immediate level and trend changes attributable to the policy change, ITSA is a statistical method for analyzing temporally ordered data to determine if an
experimental manipulation or clinical intervention has produced a reliable change in the data [15, 16].
ITSA allows the model to account for baseline levels and trends present in the data therefore allowing
us to attribute significant changes to the interruption, i.e., the lifting of the DC ban. All analyses were
completed using SAS version 9.3.
Our outcome measure for both analyses was IDU-associated HIV cases; these data were obtained from
the DC Department of Health's HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis, Sexually Transmitted Diseases, and Tuberculosis
Administration (DC DOH HAHSTA). HIV cases were divided into monthly observations of reported
new cases of HIV attributable to either IDU or MSM/IDU exposure between August 1996 and
December 2011. Due to peculiarities in HIV infection and AIDS case surveillance and reporting in the
DC Department of Health during the late 1990s and early 2000s, new infections attributable to IDU
exposure are represented by new AIDS cases (from 1998 onward) as well as new HIV cases (from 2001
onward).

Although the policy change that removed the DC Ban was signed into law in December 2007, the
actual implementation of the policy change-i.e., when the first clean syringes were distributed through
the newly created DC NEX-did not occur until May 2008. Therefore, the date of policy
implementation rather than the date of policy change serves as the interruption in our ITSA model.
Monthly new cases of HIV occurring prior to this implementation date constitute the pre-policy change
period (n = 141) and those occurring after constitute the post-policy change period (n = 44).
Using Box and Jenkins methods [17], an ARIMA model was fitted to the pre-intervention period data.
The best-fit model was identified as (0,0,1) x (0,0,1)¡2. Using this model, a forecast was created to obtain the number of IDU-associated HIV cases that would have been expected in the 24 months
following the interruption date had the policy had not changed (May 2008-April 2010). The forecasted
values were then compared with the actual observed cases during the same time period to calculate the
number of averted cases. Next, two variables were created to assess if the implementation of the policy
created a significant step-change and/or a slope change attributable to the removal of the DC Ban. The
step-change was measured using a dichotomous intervention variable which assigned a 0 value to pre- policy change observations and to post-policy change observations. The slope change was measured by creating a variable that assigned a O value to all observations in the pre-policy change time period and a value to the first observation after policy implementation, but then increased the value by one in cach subsequent post-implementation month (i.e., 1, 2, 3,.44). Using the model fitted to the pre-
implementation period, both the step and slope change variables were entered into the model for the
entire study time period as predictor variables.

Outliers with a <.01 were identified and corrected in the final model by adding them as input variables.
Shift outliers were corrected in the model by creating dichotomous variables that assigned 0 to all Page 4 of 11

observations occurring prior to the outlier date and 1 to all observations occurring after the outlier date.
Additive outliers were corrected in the model by creating dichotomous variables assigning 0 to all
observations other than the identified outlier that was assigned the value of 1. During model fitting, one

Results

of the graph indicates a decreasing trend in new cases of IDU-associated HIV infection across the pre-
and post-policy time period. The mean number of new infections attributed to IDU exposure went from
19.06 mean cases per month to 5.82 mean cases per month, a 69.5 % decrease. This same trend can be
seen in both the IDU alone (16.33-4.45, 72.7 % decrease) and MSM/IDU (2.72-1.34, 50.7 % decrease)
categories of IDU-attributable exposure (see Table 1).

Forecasting
Using the ARIMA model fitted to the pre-implementation data, we developed a forecast of the number
of expected cases for each of the 24 months following the interruption. This forecast reflects the
number of cases that would have occurred each month in DC had the policy not changed. Surveillance
data from the DC DOH reported 176 observed IDU-associated HIV cases in the years following the
repeal of the DC Ban. In contrast, the ARIMA model predicted that 296 HIV infections would have
occurred had the policy remained in place. This contrast in actual versus expected HIV infections is
shown in Fig. 2. Thus, the 2. policy change allowing for municipal support of SEPs and implementation of services in the DC that occurred based on that policy change resulted in 120 averted HIV cases in
2 years.

Epidemic Impact of Policy Change
Using the model fitted to the pre-implementation period, both the step and slope change variables were
entered into the model for the entire study time period as predictor variables (see Table 2). A significant
immediate and persistent step change (B: -6.0355, p = .0005) occurred in the month following the
lifting of the ban and there was a significant reduction in slope across the post-implementation time
period (B = -.1241, p = .0427).

Discussion Go to:

The findings of this research demonstrate that policy change can serve as an effective structural intervention for HIV prevention, particularly when changes in policy facilitate the creation or scale up
of prevention services most needed by vulnerable and marginalized populations such as PWID. Our
modeling of the forecasted versus actual epidemic curves shows that, as a result of the removal of the
DC Ban, there was a 70 % decrease in the number of newly diagnosed HIV cases where reported mode
of transmission was IDU. This decrease is present even after controlling for potential confounders, such
as seasonality, that may have affected individuals' risk of contracting HIV infection through injection
drug use. Moreover, this decrease is within the range of findings from other studies that have examined
the effects of syringe access on blood borne infections. For example, in Tacoma, syringe access was
associated with a more than 80 % reduction in the incidence of hepatitis B and C infections [18]. B
Similarly, syringe access was associated with a 33 % reduction in HIV infection in New Haven, CT [12], and a 70 % reduction in HIV infection in New York, NY [20].
Although our forecasting only takes into account the epidemic impact of the policy change in the
2 years following the removal of the DC Ban, the evidence of epidemic impact continues to be apparent
as can be seen in the ITSA which looks at the entire post-implementation period. A significant
immediate and persistent drop in number of monthly cases as well as a significant decrease in trend
over the 44 months following the policy implementation indicates that the lifting of the DC ban
continues to have a significant impact on the number of IDU-associated HIV cases that are observed in the city. One of the limitations of ITSA as methodology is that it does not allow for control of threats
to validity within the model. In order to explain potential threats to validity, one must examine qualitative or historical data to better contextualize the results of the analyses. With regard to our
ARIMA model, we observed three additive outliers that occurred in June or July of different years.
These outliers are probably attributable to increases in HIV testing (and, therefore, diagnoses of new
cases) that occurred around National HIV Testing Day, which is held annually on June 27th. DC
HAHSTA regularly participates in National HIV Testing Day and these outliers may represent years
during which the DC DOH made particularly aggressive pushes to increase testing in the District.
Similarly, the shift outlier observed in January 1999 may be an artifact of the HIV awareness events
that occurred in the DC around World AIDS Day 1998, which featured remarks by Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright [21].
In addition to having important impact on health outcomes like HIV infection, the removal of the DC
Ban has had positive impact on the cost of care for those diagnosed with HIV. According to cost-
effectiveness estimates by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the average lifetime
cost per HIV case in 2010 was 380,000 USD [22]. Therefore, averting an estimated 120 cases of HIV
infection translates to an approximate cost savings of 45.6 million USD for the DC. In the DC
Appleseed Report for 2011, it was reported that the city initially funded the SEP at 650,000 USD for
the fiscal year [23]. These funds were awarded to local community providers who applied through a

grant program administered by the DC Department of Health and were used for all aspects of operation, i.e. staffing, clean syringes, mobile units for exchange delivery, etc. The 650,000 USD amount did not
change over the next 2 years, which means that it cost the city approximately 1.3 million USD to
operate the citywide SEP in the first 2 years, the same time period for which we estimated the 120
averted HIV infections. Subtracting the amount of the SEP operating costs from the total estimated
lifetime cost of treating 120 cases of HIV infection decreases the overall savings to approximately 44.3
million USD. This estimated cost savings does not take into account the treatment of comorbid
conditions (€.g., HCV infection, mental health conditions, etc.), it but it still attests to the beneficial
impact that availability and utilization of harm reduction services can have for at-risk populations such
as PWID. Further, while over 91 % of DC residents overall have insurance [24], coverage is not
distributed evenly and much of the burden of HIV treatment services is absorbed by publicly funded
programs. To that end, it could be reasoned that the 44.3 million USD in savings is money that is saved
by taxpayers.
Another way of understanding the impact of the policy change is to examine the impact that it had on the harm reduction services provided in the District. While there are no published reports on the exact
number of syringes distributed in the 2 years prior to the implementation of the policy change, we
obtained information from the organizational records and reports to funders of the sole SEP that was in
operation during the time of the DC Ban. Based on these data, we estimate that in the two fiscal years
prior to the implementation of the DC NEX in May 2008, the existing harm reduction service had
distributed 180,000 clean syringes annually (personal communication, Prevention Works Board of Directors). In comparison, in FY 2009, the DC NEX reported exchanging approximately 314,000
syringes, providing 2,279 HIV tests, distributing 378,000 condoms, and linking 321 PWID to substance
abuse treatment [23]. While further analyses of these data are outside the scope of this manuscript, they
do show what the increased investment in syringe access "buys" in terms of actual services to the
District's PWID population.
This study had several important strengths and limitations that must be noted. With regard to the latter,
the main limitation that we encountered was the quality of the available surveillance data, particularly
for the earlier years of the study period on which we focused. As mentioned previously, early
surveillance data reflect only AIDS cases whereas, after 2001, the data reflect both HIV and AIDS
cases. Another issue is that DC HAHSTA reports that 12.3 % of diagnosed cases of HIV/AIDS
(n = 1974 cases) have an unknown exposure risk [1]. For the purposes of this study we must assume
that these cases are evenly distributed between each of the exposure risks. However, given how
marginalized PWID populations are in society, it is possible that more than an even share of those with
no exposure risk information have infections attributable to IDU. Lastly, because the DC did not adopt
name-based reporting until November 2006, reported cases in the months before this may include
duplicates. Data cleaning has been undertaken by the DC DOH to identify and remove as many
duplicates as possible.
One of the major strengths of this study is that it is examining the public health impact of: naturally occurring policy intervention, i.e., the passage of Financial Services bill HR 2764 without the syringe exchange funding restriction ("the DC Ban") for the DC. While this event was not naturally occurring
in the classic sense of the phrase (e.g., natural disasters), it was an event that had the potential to
change-and did change-the risk environment for a population vulnerable to HIV infection in the DC. In that regard, the removal of the Ban could be viewed as policy intervention for HIV prevention for PWID. Another strength of this research is that using the ARIMA modeling allowed us to control for
potential confounding factors, such as seasonality, that may have affected people's HIV infection risk.
By being able to account for the potential impact of these factors, we were able to predict with greater
certainty that the reduction in IDU-associated new HIV infections was a result of the policy change and
the programs that were implemented as a result of that change. a

One of the critical issues surrounding the study of policy change as a structural intervention is that is the
potential impact of any policy change is highly dependent on how the new policies are implemented.
For example, if the removal of the DC Ban were not followed by the infusion of funds by the DC City
Government to create and implement a SEP network, it is likely that there would have been no, tangible
change in the actual availability of services for PWID and, therefore, no impact on the numbers of new
infections associated with IDU. Similarly, it is important to remember that policies governing local-
level operations may be overridden by policy changes at the Federal-level. This point is particularly
relevant for the DC, which does not have the same autonomy as a state and therefore is more vulnerable
to the types of changes that can occur when Congress authorizes legislation governing how public
health interventions (such as HIV prevention efforts) can be implemented. Given the continued controversial nature of syringe exchange in many localities, it is important to understand that political processes affect the implementation of this necessary HIV prevention service. It is also important to
document the evidence that supports these policy changes so that these services can be maintained and
reversals in policy can be prevented.
This research provides support for the adoption of more comprehensive and integrated approach to
HIV prevention that incorporates the influence of social, structural, and policy-level factors as possible
drivers of individual- and community-level risk. In showing the epidemic impact of policy change in
the DC, our findings support the creation, promotion, and implementation of evidence-based policy for HIV prevention. Creating policies that are supportive of HIV prevention efforts can have substantial
benefit to individuals who are vulnerable to HIV/AIDS by virtue of the environments in which they
live.

California HIV Surveillance Report - 2016

Background
The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) Office of AIDS (OA) works with local health jurisdictions to collect, analyze, and disseminate surveillance data on people living with HIV in California. Providers and clinical laboratories provide HIV surveillance data to local health jurisdictions as a routine public health activity required by state law. More information about HIV surveillance in California can be found at the Office of AIDS website.
This annual surveillance report summarizes information about people diagnosed with HIV infection in California. Information is also presented for the 61 California local health jurisdictions, including 58 counties and the three city-level health jurisdictions of Berkeley, Long Beach and Pasadena. There
are three categories of data included in this report:
Number and rate of new diagnoses of HIV infection during 2012-2016
Number and rate of all persons living with diagnosed HIV infection during 2012-2016
Number and rate of deaths among persons with diagnosed HIV infection during 2012-2016
Readers interested in HIV surveillance data at the national level are directed to the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) HIV Surveillance Reports.

Summary
From 2012 through 2016, both the annual number and rate of new diagnoses of HIV infection in
California declined. The number of new diagnoses declined by 2.8% - from 5,208 in 2012 to
5,061 in 2016, while the rate of new diagnoses per 100,000 population declined by 5.8%, from
13.7 to 12.9 during the same time period.
From 2012 through 2016, the number of persons in California living with diagnosed HIV infection
increased from approximately 121,000 to over 132,000. In 2016, the prevalence rate of
diagnosed HIV infection was 336.4 per 100,000 population, compared to 319.1 in 2012- an
increase of 5.4%.
From 2012 through 2016, the annual number of deaths of persons with diagnosed HIV infection in California increased from 1,683 to 1,718. In 2016, the crude death rate of persons with
diagnosed HIV infection was 4.4 per 100,000 population the same as in 2012. Data on deaths
of persons with diagnosed HIV infection represent all causes of death, and may or may not be
related to HIV infection.

California HIV Surveillance Report - 2016 Technical Notes

The information presented in this report is based on HIV surveillance data reported to the OA through January 26, 2018, allowing for a minimum of 12 months' reporting delay. Persons are
presumed to reside in California if the most recent available address is located in the state.
The term HIV infection is defined as any diagnosis of HIV infection that met the CDC surveillance
case definition, regardless of the stage of disease (stage 0, 1, 2, 3 [AIDS], or unknown) at time of initial diagnosis. This report does not include estimates of the number of persons who are infected with HIV, but not yet diagnosed. Because persons test at differing times after becoming infected, the number of persons with newly diagnosed HIV infection is not necessarily representative of persons newly infected with HIV (HIV incidence).
Please use caution when interpreting data on trends for groups with fewer than 20 cases. Small fluctuations from year to year can lead to dramatic changes in rates, which may not be indicative of
changes in the epidemiology of HIV in these populations.
Age: The designation "adults and adolescents" refers to persons aged 12 years and older; "children" refers to persons aged less than 12 years. For newly diagnosed persons, the age group is based on the date of diagnosis. For persons living with HIV, the age group is based on the age at the end of the specified calendar year. For deaths, the age group is based on is the age at death.
Gender: Persons were classified as being transgender if a case report form affirming their
transgender status was present in HIV surveillance data by January 26, 2018. Otherwise individuals were classified according to their sex-at-birth.
Race and ethnicity: Hispanic/Latino(a) persons can be of any race. Race/ethnicity data were collected using Asian/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander as a single category until 2003; therefore persons who were classified as Asian/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander prior to 2003 and for whom no subsequent race/ethnicity information is available are classified as Asian, because they cannot be disaggregated. Although California Government Code Section 8310.5 requires CDPH to tabulate information by expanded ethnicities for each major Asian and Pacific Islander group, the data shown here are not disaggregated into those groups in order to maintain the confidentiality of these
persons.

Geography: Jurisdiction of residence was determined at the time of diagnosis for newly diagnosed persons. For all living and deceased cases, jurisdiction of residence was based on the most recent
available address.

Transmission category: Transmission category is the term for classifying cases based on a person's reported HIV risk factors. The classification is based on the CDC algorithm and results from selecting the single risk factor most likely to have been responsible for transmission, even if multiple
risk factors were reported. The CDC hierarchy of risk factors, from most likely to lead to HIV

4

California HIV Surveillance Report - 2016

transmission, to least likely, is as follows: male-to-male sexual contact (MSM) and injection drug use (IDU), MSM alone, IDU alone, receipt of clotting factor blood product for treatment of hemophilia or other chronic coagulation disorder, and high-risk-heterosexual (HRH) contact. Non-high-risk heterosexual contact was added by OA, and is last in the hierarchy. Classification is based on sex-at- birth.

Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men are in the transmission category of male-to-
male sexual contact (MSM); transgender women who have sex with men are also placed by CDC in
this transmission category. Persons who inject drugs are in the transmission category of injection drug use (IDU). Persons whose transmission category is classified as high-risk heterosexual (HRH)
contact are persons who reported engaging in heterosexual intercourse with a person of the opposite a sex-at-birth, and that partner was known to be HIV positive or engaged in an activity that put them at
high risk for HIV (i.e., MSM, IDU). The transmission category heterosexual contact non-high-risk (non-HRH) includes persons with no other identified risk, who reported engaging in heterosexual intercourse with a person of the opposite sex of their sex-at-birth. The heterosexual categories exclude men who report ever having had sexual contact with both men and women- these persons
are classified as MSM. Perinatal includes persons who were exposed immediately before or during
birth, or by breastfeeding. Cases of HIV infection reported without a risk factor listed in the hierarchy
of transmission categories are classified as "unknown risk." Other includes exposure to blood
transfusion or blood products, receiving a transplant, and other unspecified risks.
Deaths: Persons living with diagnosed HIV infection are presumed to be alive, unless a date of
death is available in the California HIV surveillance data system. Tables 1a to 1c contain data on
newly diagnosed persons, including persons who died during the year they were diagnosed. Tables • 2a to 2d include all persons living with HIV who were alive at the end of the specified calendar year, regardless of when they were diagnosed. Tables 3a to 3c include all persons who died during the
calendar year if they resided in California as of the last known address. Deaths from any cause were
included.

Rates: Rates per 100,000 persons are based on population estimates from the State of California,
Department of Finance, Report P-3: State and County Population Projections by Race/Ethnicity, Detailed Age, and Gender, 2010-2060 (Sacramento, California, December 2014). For rates at the city level we used the State of California, Department of Finance, E-4 Population Estimates for Cities, Counties, and the State, 2011-2016, with 2010 Census Benchmark. Sacramento, California,
May 2016. Dashes (--) indicate where rates could not be calculated due to unknown population
denominators.

In Care: Persons who had at least one CD4, viral load, or HIV-1 genotype test during the calendar
year were considered to be in care.

Viral Suppression: Persons whose most recent HIV viral load test result during the calendar year
was ≤ 200 copies/ml were considered to be virally suppressed.

Note: Transmission category classified by sex-at-birth. High-risk heterosexual contact (HRH): heterosexual intercourse with a person of the opposite sex-at-birth who has a high risk of HIV (e.g., MSM, IDU). Heterosexual contact (non-high-risk, Non-HRH): heterosexual intercourse with a person of the opposite sex-at-birth who does not have a high risk for HIV. Other includes hemophilia, blood transfusion, and risk factor not reported or not identified. The number of perinatal diagnoses in a given year do not reflect the number of transmissions during that year since some cases are not diagnosed at birth. Perinatal children who were less than 12 years old at diagnosis and were exposed to HIV perinatally are further categorized by the country of birth.

Note: Rates are per 100,000 population. Dash -) indicates rates not calculated due to unknown population denominators. Until 2003, Asian/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander was classified as a single category; therefore persons with race/ethnicity data only
available prior to 2003 are classified as Asian because they cannot be disaggregated.

Overall county rates were calculated using mid-year (July 1) Califomia Department of Finance county population estimates for each year. Case counts include transgender chronic hepatitis C cases. In California, 43 transgender chronic hepatitis C cases were newly reported during 2011-2015. Transgender cases are not reflected in totals for male cases, female cases or cases for which gender was unknown. Rates were not calculated for transgender persons because information on transgender identity was not consistently collected during 2011-2015.
3 Percent calculations for race/ethnicity exclude individuals for whom age or race/ethnicity was "Not Specified" from the denominator. Caution should be used when interpreting percentages by race/ethnicity, since race/ethnicity information was not reported for the majority of chronic viral hepatitis cases during 2011-2015. Positive percent changes in rates of newly reported chronic hepatitis C from 2011-2015 are highlighted red. Caution should be used when interpreting county-specific rates of newly reported cases for counties of population size fewer than 100,000; rates fluctuate widely due to their small population size.
Notes: • Rates are per 100,000 population.
Dash (-) indicates when a rate or percentage was not calculated, Rates by race/ethnicity were not calculated since race/ethnicity was not known for the majority of cases. For countles with city local health jurisdictions (LHJs), the data shown include cases from city LHJs; Alameda County includes City of Berkeley, and Los Angeles County includes City of Long Beach and City of Pasadena.
These data exclude cases reported from state prisons because people are typically incarcerated in a different county than the one in which they would otherwise live. These data do NOT measure prevalence or incidence of chronic viral hepatitis infections in California due the asymptomatic nature of chronic hepatitis C infections, varied levels of completeness of surveillance reporting, and because it remains unknown how many of the cases described in this report are currently living.

III. Applicant Organization Description (please briefly describe the organization's mission
and core services)

OCNEP is 501(c)(3) tax-exempt, California nonprofit corporation. We a are a volunteer-run, needle exchange program located in Orange County, grounded in harm reduction and evidence- based principles. Our core mission is to prevent HIV, hepatitis C, and other infectious diseases
by safely disposing of used syringes and providing sterile injection and safer sex supplies. Over
the last two years, we have served tens of thousands of clients and exchanged well over a million

syringes. We provide non-judgmental education on issues faced by people who inject drugs, and referrals to HIV and hepatitis C testing on request.

IV. Description and Summary of Proposed SEP

Program Service Delivery Mode (check one): Mobile Site

Estimated Annual Number of Clients to be Served: ~10,000

Estimated Annual Number of Syringes Dispensed & Collected ~1,000,000

SEP Locations, Days and Hours of Operation:

OCNEP will operate a mobile exchange throughout Orange County. Orange County has an
enormous and almost entirely uncared-for population of people who inject drugs. Further,
Orange County's homeless population is frequently forcibly relocated, requiring rapid relocation
changes to serve the public health need. Consequently, OCNEP has need to become a mobile needle exchange program. Currently, the organization does not have the resources to expand throughout the entire county, but it could feasibly staff mobile exchange operations in Santa Ana, Orange, and Anaheim on a weekly basis, and one exchange day a month in Costa Mesa. OCNEP
is requesting to be certified in the following several block areas within each city:

Santa Ana:
Area bounded by (N) East 4th Street, (E) North Standard Ave, (S) South Grand Avenue, and (W)
East Chesnut Avenue.

Orange:
Area bounded by (N) West Katella Ave / West Struck Avenue, (E) Main Street, (S) West
Orangewood Avenue, (W) Santa Ana River

Anaheim:
Area bounded by (N) Riverside Freeway, (E) North Olive Street, (S) East La Palma Avenue, (W) North Anaheim Boulevard

Costa Mesa: Area bounded by (N) West 18th Street, (E) Monrovia Avenue, (S) West 16th Street, (W) The outer border of Armstrong Petroleum Corporation

We would like to be certified to operate daily between the hours of 10 AM and 5 PM. This broad time range will allow us to be flexible in serving the needs of clients who may need us to adjust hours sO they can access services as their situations change. The time range also allows us to
expand to new locations and adjust hours around daylight savings. Our plan is to operate in
2

Santa Ana on Saturdays from 1-3pm, in Orange on Sundays from 1-3pm, and in Anaheim on Wednesdays from 12-2pm, and every first Friday in Costa Mesa from 1-3pm, although this could change depending on our negotiations with each of the cities . While these would be our
officially posted hours, we require a permit with a longer time frame to allow uS to serve latecomers and so we would continue to operate until clients are no longer present. At our current location, we regularly have a line with 20 to 40 people at our closing time.

For each of the SEP locations above, please provide the contact name, phone number, and e- mail for the neighborhood association of the location (if one exists):

Please provide a short summary paragraph that will be posted on the California Department of
Public Health, Office of AIDS website, which summarizes the proposed program and includes the name of the applicant organization, the name of the SEP (if different), the location(s), hours and days of service, and types of services to be delivered (not to exceed 150 words):

The Orange County Needle Exchange Program (OCNEP) is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt, California nonprofit corporation that promotes public health and safety. The core mission of OCNEP is to prevent the transmission of HIV, hepatitis C, and other infectious diseases by providing access to sterile needles, facilitating the disposal of used syringes, and providing access to safer injection and safer sex supplies. Additionally, OCNEP empowers community members by providing them with healthcare referrals, health education, STD testing and vaccination referrals, substance abuse treatment, homelessness support, and research in line with best practice models. Our mobile program will operate in several locations in Orange County throughout the week in an
effort to offer multiple days in which to dispose of used syringes, in exchange for sterile syringes. Currently our program disposes of over 20,000 used syringes per week, and we seek to expand our operations to help additional regions in the county. OCNEP seeks authorization to provide syringe exchange services at the following times and locations:

Santa Ana: Daily, 10am-5pm Area bounded by (N) East 4th Street, (E) North Standard Ave, (S) South Grand Avenue, and (W) East Chesnut Avenue.

Orange: Daily, 10am-5pm Area bounded by (N) West Katella Ave / West Struck Avenue, (E) Main Street, (S) West Orangewood Avenue, (W) Santa Ana River

outer border of Armstrong Petroleum

V. Needs Statement
Please provide the rationale for the request for Certification in the location(s) specified and use data and other objective sources to document the need. Examples include statistics on HIV infection among IDUs in the local health jurisdiction (LHJ), statistics on viral hepatitis among IDUs in the LHJ, and the presence of IDUs in the location(s):
Orange County has not been spared from the negative effects of the opiate epidemic. According to the Orange County Hcalth Care Agency (2017), Orange County experienced 12 drug
4

overdoses per 100,000 in 2015, whereas LA County experienced 7.2 per 100,000. Drug and
alcohol overdoses have increased by 82% since 2000 in the county, and of the 700 overdose
deaths per year, 66.9% were related to opioid use. In addition to these overdoses, Orange County saw 12.2 new HIV cases per 100,000. The prevalence of HIV in 2014 was 245.8 cases per 100,00. In Orange County, IV drug use transmits 9.1% of HIV cases, and 15.1% of the cases in Santa Ana, the county seat. According to the California Department of Public Health, Orange County saw 1,000 new cases of Hepatitis C in 2011. Recent research conducted by Marshall and
colleagues (2018) demonstrates that a higher increase of cheaper heroin in Orange County has contributed to an increased rate of opioid use, leading to more overdose deaths among both the county's homeless and non-homeless populations. The use of non-prescription opioids, specifically intravenous use, will inevitably create larger health concerns for these individuals, both with regard to bloodborne disease contraction and other associated ailments such as abscesses. Needless to say, there is a tremendous need for OCNEP's services in Orange County.

OCNEP has seen over 15,000 clients since opening in February 2016. We have collected over
2.25 million syringes, and has distributed over 2.5 million syringes. In late 2017, we were
exchanging over 80,000 syringes in a single day of operations, serving over 200 people in a two- hour time frame. This only scratches the surface of the high demand of harm reduction
services in the county as the majority of our clients are from the immediate surrounding areas.

VI. Additional Required Information

Additional requirements for SEP Certification are listed in the California Code of Regulations Subchapter 15, Sections 7000 through 7016, Title 17, Division 1, Chapter 4.
Applicants must attach a copy of each of the following:
a) Syringe Dispensing Plan as described in Section 7012(a);
OCNEP is applying to operate using a needs-based distribution model. However, Orange County has extremely negative perceptions about syringe litter, of which we are excecdingly aware. By being open on more days in more locations, and creating a specific email, and phone number for syringe waste complaints, we hope to mitigate the public's concerns. OCNEP will strive to ensure that the syringes we distribute are returned to the program and other authorized disposal locations. We will monitor how are effective our efforts are, and will take additional steps to
increase returns, including changing distribution if needed.

Clients will handle their own sharps containers, and will dump used syringes into the disposal
bin themselves. An intake volunteer will stand a ways back from the disposal bin, and will ask how many syringes the client disposed. The intake volunteer will then confirm the number of
syringes visually based off of the volume returned. The client will then move to the supply distribution table. Here, they will work with a volunteer or staff personal to select the type of needles, and the quantity that they would like. After this process, they will be given supplies including: sterile water or saline, cookers & twist ties, tourniquets, sterile cotton, and alcohol

5

pads. We also offer condoms, lube, abscess kits, band-aids, hand sanitizer, gauze, and 8-gallon, 2-gallon, and 1-quart sized personal sharps containers.
OCNEP has standing order for naloxone distribution and will be providing naloxone and overdose response training at all of our mobile locations.
b) Syringe Collection and Disposal Plan as described in Section 7012(b);
Clients will dispose of their used syringes in standard, OSHA-compliant sharps containers under
intake staff member. As these containers fill, they are securely closed observation of OCNEP staff after providing the number of syringes to be disposed of to the and placed in a secure location away from clients and staff. Grabbers and sharps-resistant gloves are available at all times. If syringes fall outside of a sharps container, clients are asked to retrieve them, using the protective equipment listed above if desired, and to place them in the container. This strategy has
worked effectively and safely for our two years of active operation.

Following the closure of the exchange, all areas operated in and the surrounding region will be inspected for syringe litter, which will be disposed of in the same fashion as our other syringes.
OCNEP currently a has a waste disposal contract through the CDPH Syringe Exchange Supplies Clearinghouse. The syringes collected at OCNEP will continue to be collected weekly by a certified biomedical waste hauling company (currently Biomedical Waste Disposal, Inc.) on site or at our locked, gated, storage facility. Staff will be educated as to the sharps requirements outlined in Health and Safety Code § 118286 in their mandatory training prior to working at
OCNEP. All containers will be properly sealed prior to transport.
Please see Appendix A for details on our staff training and Appendix B for our needlestick
protocol.
c) Service Delivery Plan as described in Section 7012(c);

OCNEP will provide the following services:
1. Provision of sterile syringes and other injection supplies
2. Disposal of used syringes 3. Provision of or referrals to HIV and hepatitis C testing
4. Provision of condoms and safer-sex supplies
5. Harm reduction education and materials
6. Referrals to drug abuse treatment services, vaccination, STD testing, housing services, and other social and health services as requested 7. Naloxone training and distribution
OCNEP currently provides HIV and hepatitis C testing and intermittent vaccination through partnerships with Radiant Health Center (formerly the AIDS Service Foundation OC) and the Orange County Health Care Agency. At mobile sites, OCNEP cannot guarantee that these services will be available on-site, but will always be able to provide referrals to these services.

6

d) Data Collection and Program Evaluation Plan as described in Section 7022(d);
OCNEP routinely collects all data required by California Health and Safety Code §121349 and submits this information to CDPH as required by regulation. Additionally, OCNEP has operated
multiple research studies on client demography, police interactions, and syringe litter, and expects to submit this data for publication in spring of 2018.
Weekly, OCNEP conducts thorough visual inspection walkthroughs in the regions OCNEP
operates, currently, the Santa Ana Civic Center. Once approved to operate in additional regions, OCNEP will expand these walkthroughs to all areas of operations. Syringes found will be documented and disposed of appropriately with the rest of our biohazardous waste stream.

OCNEP will continue to solicit comments from clients on a weekly basis. The organization will also conduct an annual survey when funding and staffing resources are available. Clients are also welcome to work with the organization, and to attend steering committee meetings. OCNEP will continue to hold client meetings after the program closes when clients are interested and available to meet.

e) Community Relations Plan as described in Section 7022(e);
Positive community relationships are a key component of our program. From the very beginning, we have incorporated suggestions and concerns of community members to ensure successful implementation of our program. A partial list of strong supporters, including local businesses, health professionals, and other service providers is listed on the front page of our website. Additionally, we have several petitions with hundreds of signatories both in Santa Ana and
elsewhere demonstrating community support and need for services.
In order to deal with issues surrounding needle litter in the community, OCNEP will conduct visual inspection walkthroughs in OCNEP's operational regions as described in section (d) above. OCNEP will keep track of where the syringes have been discarded over time, and will work to find solutions, such as installing permanent disposal bins, for areas that are known "hot spots". We have provided contact information to complainants within the Santa Ana Civic Center, the City of Santa Ana, and the Santa Ana Police Department, but as this application regards a county-wide program, OCNEP will set up an email account specifically for information regarding discarded needles in Orange County and display it on our website. The email address will forward to the steering committee, and the location and number of needles found will be recorded. OCNEP will then respond to the necdle litter complaint within 48 hours. OCNEP will also organize additional needle sweeps with volunteers and steering committee members. These will happen to greater degrees whenever staffing is available.
OCNEP will continue to welcome feedback from the community by both phone and email. Our contact information will be posted on our website. OCNEP will respond to phone calls and emails within 48 hours.

7

In order to work with the county and law enforcement, OCNEP is willing to meet with both entities on a regular basis. OCNEP will attempt to meet with the county government, the sheriff's department, and members of the community at least once a year to discuss the program and any concerns. This, however, will be dependent on the availability of the county, the
sheriff's department, any concerned community members, and the volunteer staff at OCNEP. If funds are available, OCNEP plans to host this annual meeting.

Lastly, OCNEP will coordinate police training seminars for local law enforcement agencies that
will train officers on how to handle and dispose of needles safely. These seminars will also go
over the importance of syringe exchange, and the laws about carrying syringes.
f) A budget for the program a which includes a minimum projected income and costs for personnel, outside services and operating expenses, including but not limited to rent, utilities,
equipment, materials including syringes and disposal containers, transportation, insurance, training, meetings, syringe disposal services, and indirect costs.
OCNEP currently receives in-kind supplies through the CDPH Syringe Exchange Clearinghouse. Additionally, we are funded by private donors, AIDS United, the California Medical Association Foundation, the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation, the Arnold P. Gold Foundation, the
California HealthCare Foundation, and others. We have operated for over two years with no issues of financial hardship. Our most up-to-date expenditure budget is attached below in
Appendix C.

Appendix A. Staff Training

All staff and volunteers must observe proper safety and security precautions during syringe exchange operations. All volunteers seeking to work on-site at OCNEP must complete the OCNEP Training Program and the OCNEP Mentorship Program. Volunteers will be trained to
understand and implement evidence-based harm reduction approaches to conducting needle
exchanges. The safety of our volunteers and success of the program depends on our up to-date
protocols and practices.

OCNEP Training Program The OCNEP Training Program is based on the best practices established by other needle exchange programs, local and state public health authorities, the Harm Reduction Coalition, and the World Health Organization. The Training Program will be periodically updated.
Training will be conducted by experienced experts from local HIV/STD prevention agencies and
experienced OCNEP members.

Training will include, but not be limited to, the following: An overview of harm reduction philosophies and techniques; An overview of OCNEP's harm reduction model;
• An overview of the logistics behind OCNEP's mobile exchange program;
• A detailed lecture on safety guidelines and protocols, which will include a large segment on the prevention and management of needlestick injuries; An overview of the security measures taken to maintain the supply of needles, syringes,
etc.;

• An overview of OCNEP's volunteer policy; and
• An overview of client rights and responsibilities.

OCNEP Mentorship Program

The OCNEP Mentorship Program requires all volunteers to shadow at an established needle
exchange program or be mentored at OCNEP until their competency is established. Now that OCNEP has opened, volunteers are expected to complete their mentorship on-site at OCNEP, however, shadowing at the Los Angeles Community Health Project remains an acceptable alternative. Experienced OCNEP members will clarify the procedures, answer questions, and have additional discussions with new OCNEP volunteers and determine whether they have
established competency to work on-site at OCNEP. To keep OCNEP volunteers up to date with
logistics and safety protocols, continuing education will be required.
Under all circumstances, OCNEP staff, peers and volunteers are expected to place their own safety first and to follow their best judgment, referring to this protocol and using supervisory support as needed. No procedural guidelines can anticipate every situation that could arise, hence training, shadowing, and mentoring is mandatory.

Our needlestick injury protocol is based off the emergency needlestick injury protocol developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Specifically, if a needlestick injury occurs, the patient will wash the area with soap and water, notify on-site staff and OCNEP administration, and see a physician for medical advice, testing, and post-exposure prophylaxis if indicated. This protocol will be part of mandatory staff training, and a description of the protocol will be posted on-site. Please see Appendix B on the following page for details.

Subject: Orange County Needle Exchange Program - request for consultation

Chief Sharpnak -

This email is to inform you that the Orange County Needle Exchange Program (OCNEP) submitted an application to the California Department of Public Health, Office of AIDS (CDPH/OA) for authorization of their syringe exchange program. Office of AIDS staff reviewed the application, found that it meets the requirements of Health and Safety Code Section 121349 (which outlines the application process), and initiated the next step in the application process - a 90-day public comment period.

The 90-day public comment period was opened through a posting on the department website. Public comment closes on June 25, 2018. The posting and instructions for submitting public comment can be found here:

Orange County Needle Exchange Program 90-day public comment period

In accordance with additional requirements in Health and Safety Code Section 121349, CDPH is seeking consultation with local law enforcement leadership through you in your role as Chief of Police in one of the districts in which OCNEP requests to provide services. In consultation, CDPH is asking for any input or comment that you may have pertaining to the request. Input may be provided, per your preference, by phone call or via email or written correspondence.
We'll reach out to your office next week to schedule a brief teleconference for the consultation. The regulations governing this process require CDPH to issue a final decision on the request for authorization by Monday August 6. If you prefer to submit input via email I'd appreciate your sending this to me before Monday, June 25, 2018 (the day public comment closes).
Thank you for your attention to this matter - please feel free to contact me in the meantime with any

June 14, 2018

Ms. Carol Crump, MFT
California Department of Public Health P.O. Box 997377, MS 0500
Sacramento, CA 95899-7377

Dear Ms. Crump:
On behalf of the Anaheim Police Department (APD), I submit this letter to the California Department of Public Health in opposition to an application by the Orange County Needle Exchange Program (OCNEP) to provide a syringe exchange service in the City of Anaheim.
The application submitted by a OCNEP includes a program model and several components which are concerning in terms of public safety and quality of life in certain impacted areas. Since the application was submitted, have spoken with law enforcement chief executives both locally and in other parts of the country where OCNEP and similar programs have been in operation. One consistent byproduct from these programs was gleaned through these conversations: the significant increase and proliferation of both used and unused syringes in the areas surrounding the locations where these programs are operational. Even without a program similar to one being sought by the applicant, Anaheim recently experienced a problem in a specific geographic area wherein substantial quantities of syringes began appearing in public places including bus stops, libraries and in parks. It was determined the proliferation was due to a local retailer selling inexpensive syringes in gross quantities. APD worked with the retailer, which changed its practices and the problem has been resolved.

The applicant's selection of the intended location to operate this mobile program is also troubling in many regards. The location is one with many existing challenges, and one which the City has made great progress in improving in terms of homelessness, drug use and crime. OCNEP's proposed application would create a draw for individuals who engage in intravenous drug use to this location, and likely a draw for drug sellers as well. Further, this area is adjacent to a dog park, event and sports stadium and one of the City's largest parks. Used by families and children, these public spaces would be significantly and negatively impacted by this program due to discarded syringes and illegal conduct which is completely inconsistent with the intended use of these limited public resources.
Finally, APD and the City in collaboration with neighboring police agencies and community-based organizations have made tremendous strides in addressing
homelessness in Anaheim over the past five years. More than 1,200 individuals have been

425 S. Harbor Blvd. assisted out of homelessness into housing with a 92% retention rate. In addition, APD
Anaheim, CA 92805 administers the City's Drug Free Anaheim program in which persons suffering from addiction can simply walk into any police station or approach any officer and ask for help.

referrals. To date, almost 300 individuals have participated in the program with over 220 individuals in treatment facilities. Experts in the field of addiction, the third party provider
facilitating Drug Free Anaheim has expressed great concerns with this proposed syringe exchange program by OCNEP, advising the program could potentially disrupt the recovery and treatment successes we have made.

In consideration of the recent local and out of state experiences highlighted above coupled with the likely degradation of our progress in addressing homelessness and drug addiction in our community, the APD opposes the OCNEP application to establish a syringe exchange program
in Anaheim.

Dear Ms. Crump:

The City of Orange is submitting this letter to the California Department of Public Health to
express our opposition to an application by the Orange County Needle Exchange Program
(OCNEP) to provide a syringe exchange service in the City of Orange,
Based on the location indicated in their application, it appears OCNEP is intending to serve the
area adjacent to the Santa Ana River Recreation Trail (SART). While the SART had been a
location where homeless encampments have been in existence for a few years, the County of Orange, under the supervision of Federal Judge David 0. Carter recently cleared out the
encampments. As such, there is not homeless population that resides in the area targeted for
the syringe exchange program.
The County of Orange, in cooperation with the City of Orange has expended a significant amount of resources to properly relocate the homeless individuals from SART and restore the area for public recreational purposes. Please know that Orange has a long track record of
compassion and outreach to the homeless population and those facing drug addiction in our community, however it would not be prudent to offer a program that would re-introduce homeless individuals back to the SART area.

Further, the City of Orange also has concerns related to the operations of the program. Specifically, the recent experience in the City of Santa Ana, which revoked the permit for a needle exchange program, suggests that the program resulted in uncapped hypodermic needles littering the area in and around the Santa Ana Civic Center, endangering the public working and visiting the area.
Therefore, based on the above noted concerns, the City of Orange opposes the OCNEP application to establish a syringe exchange in Orange.

City of Costa Mesa Police Department
Memorandum SOSTHA

DATE: May 1, 2018 CITY ON THE ARTS

TO: California Department of Public Health CCOREOLD
FROM: Captain Bryan Glass, Acting Chief of Police

SUBJECT: Orange County Needle Exchange Program (OCNEP)

The Costa Mesa Police Department (CMPD) submits its initial response to OC Needle Exchange Program's (OCNEP) request to California Department of Public Health to operate a needle exchange program in the City of Costa Mesa in accordance with Health and Safety Code Section 121349 et. seq.

Since California's Proposition 47 was passed on November 4, 2014, the Police Department has seen an increase in calls for service from residents, school officials, library employees and business owners regarding hypodermic needles being found in public parks, sidewalks, local neighborhoods, private businesses, and public bathrooms. This has caused concerns with residents and visitors within our Costa Mesa community.

Recently, Police Department staff attempted to contact representatives from OCNEP to
better understand the services they would provide our community. The provided OCNEP
voicemail message indicated that as of January 2018, the City of Santa Ana has prevented OCNEP from operating in their city and they encourage people to petition their local city councils. It was not until several days later that a representative from OCNEP returned our phone call and left a voicemail. Staff was able to finally reach a representative of OCNEP this morning just prior to the submision of this memorandum.

Since OCNEP had not responded to CMPD's call in a timely manner, we were required to investigate other cities' experiences with OCNEP. Interestingly, the City of Santa Ana attempted a partnership with OCNEP and determined it did not reduce hypodermic needle
waste or the transmission of blood borne diseases associated with hypodermic needle drug
use, but actually appeared to increase the problem. For this reason the City of Santa Ana decided to discontinue the program. According to a February 1, 2018 article in the Orange County Register, Santa Ana Deputy City Manager, Robert Cortez, stated, "Syringe litter became a rampant problem since the needle exchange's inception. A lot of unintended consequences came with the program." Further, "There was needle debris everywhere in the (civic) center, to the point where some of the books at the Santa Ana library had needles
inside of them."

1

CMPD researched the services OCNEP provides and determined the following potential pros and cons:
Potential pros:
Decrease spread of illness like HIV. Santa Ana reported it has the highest rate of HIV infection in the county. Statistics from the Orange County Health Care Agency indicated there was a 201.2% increase in Hepatitis C rates in Orange County from
2011 to 2015 since the last analysis from the California Department of Public Health.

Reduces the risk of law enforcement officers becoming infected by accidental needle
sticks. OCNEP claims the needles are less likely to be contaminated with the use of
their program.
O CMPD has not seen any statistical data to support OCNEP's above claim. Further, there is no way to determine if a needle has been contaminated.
Exposed officers will still be required to fulfill a six-month medical treatment process to address the potential health concern.

Reduces the risk of contaminated needles being shared.
O Many drug addicts continue to share needles regardless of a needle exchange program. Needle sharing is a common habit based on recent conversations with drug users contacted in Costa Mesa.

Potential cons:

This program could be a "magnet" for drug users in other cities where a needle exchange program does not exist, thus drawing more drug users to Costa Mesa.
A needle exchange program will completely undermine the successful recovery of the
large number of former addicts living in Costa Mesa's sober living community. Costa
Mesa currently has the largest concentration of residential sober living treatment facilities providing nonmedical treatment for individuals recovering from addiction than anywhere else in Orange County, and the highest number of any city in the State. With a total of 91 state licensed residential drug and alcohol treatment
facilites, the City has 27% of all such facilites in the county. In addition, there are an estimated 83 sober living homes, both permitted and unpermitted, operating in Costa Mesa. The purpose of these programs is straightforward - to provide an environment where individuals that are working to beat their addiction can live with similarly situated individuals in a group setting while also living and working within the greater
community. Bringing a needle exchange program to Costa Mesa completely
undermines the efforts of both the sober living community and the City. As indicated
above, with so few needle exchange programs operating in Orange County, there
would be an inevitable migration of individuals suffering from addiction coming to
Costa Mesa seeking free needles. An unintended consequence of this is that this
increase in consumers exposed to a needle exchange program could very likely undermine the succesfull recovery of those living within the sober living community.

2

Increased number of needles disposed within Costa Mesa parks, streets, schools etc. creates a health risk to residents and visitors. According to Santa Ana's experience with OCNEP, the needle exchange program successfully distributed needles, however, failed to ensure that needles distributed were properly disposed. As a result, used needs were endemic in Santa Ana's Civic Center and other public
spaces posing a risk to the community. OCNEP has not provided Costa Mesa with any information as to how it would ensure that the needles it distributes would be
properly accounted for and disposed. Based upon Santa Ana's experience with OCNEP, the needle exchange program poses a threat to the health of the Costa Mesa community with an increased number of needles improperly disposed.
The program iS run by volunteers only. An evident shortcoming of this may be a lack of timely communication between the City and representatives of OCNEP, making for a potentially challenging working relationship. Further, operation times for OCNEP would be four days a week, 10am to 5pm, with no determined times for needle
disposal services.

The location selected for distribution is the area bounded by W. 18th St., W 16th St,
Monrovia Ave., and the outer border of the Armstrong Petroleum Building. This area is less than 0.4 miles from Whittier Elementary and corresponding neighborhoods. This concern for local schools and students was articulated in a recent
correspondence from Vicki Snell, President of the Newport-Mesa Unified School District Board of Education, dated April 25, 2018, to City Manager Tom Hatch in opposition of a needle exchange program in Costa Mesa.
Due to the potential increase in needles being provided within the community, Costa Mesa Police and Fire Departments will likely see an increase in call for service responses to found needles, inadvertent needle accidents and potential exposure to bystanders. This also includes potential increases in •responses to drug overdoses and persons under the influence of drugs.
After reviewing the above information and discussing the public safety concerns with the City's Homeless Coordinator, Muriel Ullman, and our City's Homeless Outreach Team, as
well as Deputy City Attorney Adrienne Mendoza, there is a unanimous agreement regarding
the potential public safety concerns posed by the OCNEP. Therefore, CMPD is opposed to implementation of the OCNEP in Costa Mesa at this time.

The information provided in this memorandum is based upon CMPD's preliminary investigation and may be supplemented with further information prior to the deadline set to
submit comments.

City of Costa Mesa Police Department
e- 14g1.. Memorandum

CIN OETNEANE DATE: June 21, 2018

o TO: California Department of Public Health APORATEO Carol Crump, MFT

FROM: Captain Bryan Glass, Acting Chief of Police

SUBJECT: Orange County Needle Exchange Program (OCNEP) Supplemental Information from the Costa Mesa Police Department

On May 1, 2018, the Costa Mesa Police Department (CMPD) submitted a response to the Orange County Needle Exchange Program's (OCNEP) request to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) to operate a mobile needle exchange program within the City of Costa Mesa in accordance with Health and Safety Code Section 121349. This is a supplemental memorandum providing further information outlining the concern CMPD has with OCNEP's proposed operation in Costa Mesa.

City of Santa Ana

As previously reported, the City of Santa Ana discontinued its MOU with OCNEP based on
the impacts the needle exchange program had on pervasive needle litter within their Civic Center. The concerns were subsequently outlined in the notice of MOU termination letter
from Santa Ana City Manager Raul Godinez II to Mr. Nathan Birnbaum of the OCNEP Steering Committee, dated December 6, 2017. OCNEP's application did not address the deficiencies in their operation within the City of Santa Ana thus, by extension, how they would avoid those deficiencies here. Therefore, the concerns shared by City Manager Raul Godinez Il are foreseeable issues the City of Costa Mesa would face if the State were to approve OCNEP's operation in. Costa Mesa. As stated, "The City of Santa Ana has received numerous written and verbal complaints about used and discarded hypodermic needles found in the Civic Center and the Santa Ana Library...Used and discarded hypodermic needles found in the Civic Center including the library, have placed employees, contractors, and patrons, including children and unaccompanied minors, at risk of disease or injury." Further, ..the program itself, including the manner in which it operates, has created unintended consequences that have negatively impacted the patrons that visit the Santa Ana Public Library, the Civic Center, and surrounding community." (See Attachment A; Letter dated December 6, 2017 from Santa Ana City Manager to OCNEP).
Photographs provided by the City of Santa Ana documenting found needles within their Civic Center during the term of the MOU with OCNEP are also attached hereto. (See Attachment
B; Photographs from the City of Santa Ana). These photographs demonstrate the proliferation of needles in places patronized by residents and members of the community that the City of

CMPD Memorandum re OCNEP (cont'd)

Costa Mesa will experience under this same program. Also attached are numerous
complaints from members of the Santa Ana community expressing serious concerns over the
public safety and health risk caused by OCNEP. (See Attachment C; Community complaints from the City of Santa Ana).
The OCNEP application says, ...all areas operated in and the surrounding region will be inspected for syringe litter, which will be disposed of in the same fashion as our other syringes." (See page 6 of Attachment D; Orange County Needle Exchange Program
Application for Certification as a Mobile Syringe Exchange). The application also says, "OCNEP conducts thorough visual inspection walkthroughs in the regions OCNEP operates, currently, the Santa Ana Civic Center". (See page 7 of Attachment D). The language in the application regarding mitigation of needle litter seems to be more specific to the area immediately surrounding the OCNEP distribution site, and less on the greater community that will also be affected and does not offer concrete solutions to what the City of Santa Ana experienced. Further, this collection happens well after the fact and is clearly not a proactive approach to collecting needle litter.

Proposed Area of Operation

OCNEP cast an extremely wide net for its proposed area of operation far beyond an area manageable for Police and Public Services to provide support for this program. The proposed area of operation for OCNEP is 18th Street to the north, 16th Street to the south, Monrovia Avenue to the east, and the city border to the west. (See Attachment E; Google Maps of OCNEP's Proposed Area to Operate Mobile Syringe Exchange.) According to City records,
there are approximately 2,000 listed addresses within this proposed area. Of those,
approximately 500 are residential addresses. There are approximately 1,500 business licenses issued within the area. This area contains numerous single-family homes and apartment complexes, as well as several mobile home parks that are largely occupied by
seniors.

The OCNEP application states that there are "No HOA or NA in the blocks we've selected. The closest ones are Newport Crest (1.6 miles south) and Pacific Ave (2 miles north)." (See page 3 of Attachment D). However, this information is inaccurate as the California Seabreeze single-family housing community lies at the west end of 18th St. with houses contained within the outlined area. The California Seabreeze community does indeed have an.HOA. Californiaa.....
Seabreeze HOA President, John Susman, reported having no contact or dialogue with any member from OCNEP. Further, there are at least two 55-plus senior multi-unit living communities within this area, Play Port Mobile Village and Greenleaf Park. The Vivante
assisted living apartment community is located at 1640 Monrovia Avenue (on the east border of the proposed area). Vivante has 185 units and according to their representative Cory Alder, they have not been contacted by any member from OCNEP. Finally, the manager of the 48- unit Orange Coast mobile home park, which is also in the proposed area, confirmed that the OCNEP had not reached out to him either. This evidence demonstrates an incomplete outreach process and is part of several innacuracies in the group's application. This demonstrates this group's lack of ability to follow through and manage the risks this program has the potential to bring to the community.

CMPD Memorandum re OCNEP (cont'd)

As previously reported, on April 25, 2018, Costa Mesa City Manager Tom Hatch received correspondence from Newport-Mesa Unified School District (NMUSD) Board of Education President Vicki Snell, regarding OCNEP's proposed implementation. (See Attachment F: Letter dated April 25, 2018 from NMUSD President Vicki Snell to City Manager Tom Hatch). The concern stated is "Newport-Mesa Unified School District has an elementrary school located just north of this area, on 18th Street and Whittier Avenue. We have extremely high concerns about the proximity of this operation (OCNEP) near any of our schools, and especially during school hours.' Whittier Elementary school is just north of the proposed area of operation as demonstrated in Attachment F.

Analysis of Figures in the OCNEP Application:
OCNEP's application to CDPH to operate a mobile needle exchange in areas of Orange County noted some figures regarding the collection and dispensing of needles within the
community that causes concern.. Described on the OCNEP website1 "We exchange on a one-for-one plus 20 basis, meaning that we'll give you as many syringes as you dispose of, plus 20." This questionable practice of 21 needles dispensed for every 1 needle collected (21:1), coupled with the troubling information provided by the City of Santa Ana based on their experience with OCNEP, certainly presents a compelling public safety and health risk and speaks to the state's criteria for a certification of a syringe exchange program (SEP) under 17 CCR 7004, subsection (c), "Evidence of projected harm to public safety, presented by local .:.. law enforcement official(s), is, in the department's judgment, greater than evidence of projected benefits to public health."

The OCNEP application states that since opening in February 2016, "We have collected over
2.25 million syringes, and has distributed over 2.5 million syringes". (See page 5 of Attachment D). This means their shrinkage rate is 10%, or approximately 250,000
unaccounted syringes left within the community. This is important because OCNEP operated
within the Santa Ana Civic Center between February 2016 and January 2018, during the
.F... . height of the recent homeless crisis in the Santa Ana River Trail in central Orange County. The culminating River Trail cleanup effort that occurred between January 22, 2018 to March 3, 2018, netted an alarming 13,950 needles found, as reported by the Orange County Register. These needles posed a significant risk to the public, which was subsequently reported in a March 8, 2018, newspaper article entitled, Thousands of Pounds of Human
Waste, Close to 14,000 Hypodermic Needles Cleaned Out from Santa Ana River Homeless
Encampmentsz.

The OCNEP application estimates the "Annual Number of Syringes Dispensed and Collected"
to be approximately "1,000,000". (See page 2 of Attachment D). This reported number leads
us to assume OCNEP projects to both collect and dispense one million needles (1:1 ratio). However, based on the 10% shrinkage rate in their reporting above, we know that OCNEP does not operate a 1:1 dispense to collection ratio. In fact, with OCNEP's policy of dispensing and collecting at a ratio of 21:1, for every million needles collected they would dispense 21
million needles. Or for every million needles dispensed, they would have collected 50,000 needles. Either way, the reported single figure of "1,000,000" appears incomplete and inaccurate.

CMPD Memorandum re OCNEP (cont'd)

The OCNEP application states, "In late 2017, we were exchanging over 80,000 syringes in a single day of operations, serving over 200 people in a two-hour time frame". (See page 5 of Attachment D). The accuracy of this statement seems highly unlikely. OCNEP reports on
their website a policy of distributing a maximum 200 needles per person. If OCNEP served "over 200 people" (suggesting the number is close in proximity to 200 people), then the maximum number of total syringes dispensed to 200 people would only be approximately 40,000 needles, half of what they report exchanging per day. Suggesting even if OCNEP served 300 people per day and provided the maximum 200 needles per person (given that each of those persons brought back a minimum of 10 used needles under the 21:1 ratio), the total number of needles dispensed would only be 60,000, nowhere close to the 80,000 needles reported. It is concerning that the data seems significantly inconsistent.
The reporting of the figures by OCNEP outlined above suggests serious questions of accuracy in OCNEP's application and/or needle exchange practice. Under the criteria outlined in 17
CCR 7004 allowing the State to deny a SEP application, subsection (a) states, "Information submitted in the application is incorrect or incomplete." CMPD is concerned that the
information submitted in the application to operate in Costa Mesa may be incorrect or
incomplete.

The OCNEP application describes how clientele will also be provided "supplies including: sterile water or saline, cookers & twist ties, tourniquets, sterile cotton, and alcohol pads. We also offer condoms, lube abscess kits, band-aids, hand sanitizer, gauze, and 8- gallon, 2-gallon, and 1-quart sized personal sharps containers" (See pages 5-6 of Attachment
D). OCNEP's website corroborates that injection and safer sex supplies will be
distributed. These points seem to be lost in much of the public discussion and media reporting
of OCNEP's proposed operation. It is concerning from a public safety perspective that not only will the community be challenged with needle litter, but also litter from used condoms, used opioid cooking paraphernalia, and other used supplies. Many of these items pose a risk of transmission of diseases and other health issues if they were to come in contact with children, community members, as well as Police and other City personnel. OCNEP's application does not address the safe collection or assisted disposal of these items.
Statistics from the Orange County Health Care Agency indicated there was a 201.2% increase in Hepatitis C rates in Orange County from 2011 to 20153 since the last analysis from the California Department of Public Health. According to the United States Census Bureau, Orange County's population in 2017 was 3,190,400 people. Costa Mesa's reported population was 113,825 people4, or only 3,6% of the overall county population. With that said, it is unclear in the information from OCNEP what Costa Mesa's represented impact is on the
overall county Hepatitis C data that seemingly substantiated it as a target city for this program. Any Hepatitis C data specific to Costa Mesa was unable to be located at the time of this
memorandum. Further, the CDPH website's California Opiod Overdose Surveillance
Dashboard charts the age-adjusted rate of all opiod overdose deaths per 100,000 residents by zip code. Costa Mesa's zip code 92627 ranks eighth in Orange County zip codes with 15.84 per 100,000 residents; Costa Mesa's other zip code, 92626, ranks 42nd with 4.46 per 100,000 residents5, which is below both the Orange County and California average reported on the website.

CMPD Memorandum re OCNEP (cont'd)

Public Concerns

Since submitting our initial response, the City of Costa Mesa City Council has reported conversations and/or correspondence with members of the Costa Mesa community who also oppose a program like this, citing public health concerns. Also, on June 5, 2018, the Orange County Board of Supervisors adopted a resolution opposing OCNEP's operation in Costa
Mesa, Santa Ana, Anaheim, Newport Beach and Orange6.

Conclusion

It is clear in discussions with officials from the Santa Ana Police Department and reviewing written correspondence and photographs provided by the City of Santa Ana regarding the prevelance of dangerous and potentially harmful discarded needles within the community, that this needle exchange program poses a serious risk to public safety and health by inadequately accounting for the collection of the volume of needles dispensed. The 21:1 dispensing to collection ratio seems highly irresponsible without a comprehensive plan to account for and mitigate unreturned needles left within the community. Police, Fire and Public Services would likely see a spike in needle-related calls for service from the communty to respond and collect abandoned needles, as well as respond to exposures and injuries to community members as a result of intentional and unintentional contact with these items.
As indicated above, what the City of Santa Ana experienced within their Civic Center may have likely also been a contributing factor to the nearly 14,000 needles found in the Santa Ana River Trail during the early 2018 clean up effort.
As previously cited, OCNEP's application to operate a mobile needle exchange program appears to provide inaccurate and contradicting information, to include figures and practices relating to the collection and dispensing of needles and the reporting of neighborhood associations that may be impacted within the proposed area. Again, this puts into serious question this group's ability to manage the serious risks that come with this program.
Based on the information provided, to include CMPD's initial response on May 1, 2018, CMPD
is opposed to the implementation of the OCNEP in Costa Mesa at this time due to signifcant concerns and OCNEP's failure to demonstrate improvements in the operation of their program that would ameliorate the significant public health and safety issues caused by their previous
operation in the City of Santa Ana.

Re: Orange County Needle Exchange Program Application For Certification As a
Mobile Syringe Exchange

Dear Chief Flores:

For the reasons below, on behalf of the Santa Ana Police Department, hereby strongly oppose the Orange County Needle Exchange Program's ("OCNEP") application for certification for mobile syringe needle exchange services in the City of Santa Ana ("City") at the following
locations:

Area bounded by (N) East 4th Street, (E) North Standard Ave., (S) South Grand Avenue, and (W) East Chestnut Avenue'
As you know, OCNEP operated a stationary needle exchange program in the Santa Ana Civic
Center for more than one and one half years. During that time, there were repeated concerns and the City articulated as much in January 2018 during meetings with OCNEP and conference calls with officials from the Department of Public Health Office of AIDS, that the program negatively affected the operation of the Civic Center, visitors to the Civic Center and Santa Ana residents in the surrounding area. The City continues to maintain that position.
OCNEP's latest desire to operate a "mobile needle exchange" only heightens the City's health and safety concerns for the Santa Ana community. The stationary needle exchange operation highlighted OCNEP's inability to provide for effective recovery of used and discarded needles on
City premises. The City continues to have little or no confidence that OCNEP can manage effective recovery of used needles in the context of mobile operations conducted on more frequent, mobile basis at multiple locations throughout the City. It goes without saying that improper disposal of used needles endangers the health and safety of residents and is of profound concern to the City.

Hours of Operation: Daily between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.

Page 2 of 2

As you know, the City previously submitted materials that illustrated and articulated the negative impacts and the attendant grave health and safety concerns following OCNEP's operations in the Civic Center for nearly two years. We refer you to review those materials.
The City desires to contribute to solving the public health concerns to prevent the spread of infectious diseases; however, OCNEP has failed to provide a concrete plan to defensibly mitigate the quality of life concerns and the significant impact on public safety and public health itself due to the adverse impact. OCNEP's past failure even after being notified of the hazardous needle debris erodes the plan's intended public health benefit and instead, poses healthy and safety risks to even more people.

We note the standards for refusal to certify an initial SEP application include, "evidence of projected harm to public safety, presented by local law enforcement official(s)" that is "greater than evidence of projected benefits to public health." Title 17, California Code of Regulations, section 7004(c). The public interest demands equal consideration of this factor. Here, the harm to public safety significantly outweighs the benefits to public health conferred by the OCNEP.
Sincerely,

-.DAVID VALENTIN

Dear California Department of Public Health (CDPH):

I am writing on behalf of the Orange County Board of Supervisors, and as Chairman of the Board, to
express our opposition to the establishment of a moblle Orange County Needle Exchange Program (OCNEP) due to the health and safety threat that it poses to the residents of Orange County, California.
As you know, OCNEP became the first needle exchange program here in Orange County when it was approved for operation by CDPH in 2016. Citing public health risks, the City of Santa Ana declined to renew OCNEP's permit after allowing the program to operate in the Santa Ana Civic Center from February, 2016 until January, 2018.

During that time, Santa Ana Public Library staff have reported finding as many as 40-50 discarded syringes on the property per month, including on shelves, near players, window sills, and even inside books, posing a threat to patrons. The City of Santa Ana has also shared instances of employees being pricked by discarded needles, which litter parks and sidewalks. While substance use disorder certainly impacts individuals from all communities, research indicates that substance abuse is more common among individuals experiencing homelessness, and the City of Santa Ana estimates its unsheltered homeless population to have more than doubled from 2017 to 2018.
After being denied a local permit by the City of Santa Ana, OCNEP is now seeking to make their operations mobile and travel to a variety of cities here. Law enforcement officials in the City of Costa
Mesa, one stated destination for the mobile unit, fear the program will make the city's drug problem worse by attracting users from other cities where a needle exchange program does not exist.
The County of Orange is not without compassion for those struggling with substance use issues. Our Health Care Agency already provides HIV prevention programs that include messaging about the risks of sharing needles and makes referrals to drug treatment programs. Our staff offers substance use disorder programs and services in an attempt to eliminate drug use, thereby lowering the risk of needle sharing for those who are successful in treatment.

I urge you to deny OCNEP's application to operate a mobile needle exchange here in Orange County and
am available at (714) 834-3110 and Andrew.Do@ocgov.com to answer any questions you may have.

Thank you for your consideration.

RESOLUTION OF THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO OPPOSE
THE ORANGE COUNTY NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAM
June 5, 2018
WHEREAS, the first obligation of the Orange County Board of Supervisors is to ensure the
safety and wellbeing of its residents; and
WHEREAS, the Orange County Needle Exchange Program became the first ever needle- exchange in Orange County when it was approved for operation by the California Department of Public Health in 2016; and
WHEREAS, the City of Santa Ana declined to renew the permit for Orange County Needle Exchange after allowing the program to operate in the Santa Ana Civic Center from February, 2016 until January, 2018; and
WHEREAS the City of Santa Ana discontinued their needle exchange program due to the public health threat posed a by a sharp increase in discarded syringes in the Civic Center; and
WHEREAS, the Santa Ana Public Library suffered an increase of syringe littering including reports of syringes left on shelves, near planters, window sills, and even in books; and
WHEREAS, Santa Ana Public Library representatives have been reported to have said that "before the needle exchange opened, library staff rarely found syringes in the facility, but began
to find 40 to a 50 a month after it opened"; and
WHEREAS, the City of Santa Ana's rampant problem with syringes after the needle exchange's inception included instances of employees being pricked by discarded needles; and
WHEREAS, the Orange County Needle Exchange Program plans to distribute syringes on a one-for-one plus 20 basis, dramatically increasing the number of syringes in Orange County; and
WHEREAS, the Orange County Needle Exchange Program indicates that while in operation it was disposing of approximately 20,000 needles per week; and
WHEREAS, using the one-for-one plus 20 rate of needle exchange, the collection of 20,000 needles per week would equate to 420,000 needles released into the community per week; and
WHEREAS, during the Environmental Remediation Project along the Santa Ana River Trail earlier this year, approximately 14,000 needles wore removed from a less than four mile stretch in a two week period; and
WHEREAS, the Orange County Needle Exchange would endanger our communities and sacrifice the safety of our public in exchange for providing safe drug use to program users; now, therefore be it

RESOLVED, that the Orange County Board of Supervisors does hereby oppose the establishment of the Orange County Needle Exchange Progtam and the health and safety risks that it poses to the County of Orange, and directs the Clerk of the Board to submit this resolution to the California Department of Public Health before the June 25th, 2018 deadline.

Karen L. Smith, MD, MPH 3/30/2018 Date
Director & State Public Health Officer
California Department of Public Health
RECOMMENDATION: To reduce the spread of HIV and viral hepatitis, the Centers for Infectious Diseases (CID), Office of AIDS (OA) recommends authorization of the Orange County Needie Exchange Program (OCNEP) to conduct mobile syringe exchange and disposal services in four locations in Orange County. OA has determined that OCNEP has met all of the requirements outlined in Health and Safety Code (HSC)
Section 121349 and California Code of Regulations, Title 17, Subchapter 15, SEP Certification (17 CCR 15) to qualify for authorization. Authorization would be effective August 6, 2018 through August 6, 2020, and subject to renewal before the end of the certification period.
In order to accommodate concerns conveyed during consultation with local law enforcement and received during the public comment period, and per request and consult of OCNEP, CDPH/OA recommends administratively approving amendments to OCNEP's operations as to location (geographic scope of service areas is narrowed, see Attachment C: Maps of locations) and enhancement of syringe litter cleanup efforts,
described below.

To further address concerns, as a condition of authorization, OCNEP has agreed to:

4 Work with the Orange County Health Care Agency to expand sharps disposal options such as determining effective placement of additional disposal kiosks for the areas served by OCNEP;

® Operate a hotline and email address through which to field reports of improperly discarded syringes, and develop a map of litter hotspots to inform strategic syringe litter collection;

CDPH 1058 (5/15)

Conduct additional syringe recovery services including area sweeps in and around mobile service
areas;
Document concerns and positive feedback expressed by community members, neighborhood associations, program participants, and/or local law enforcement officials; and
• Document steps the program has taken to address concerns.

Additionally, to better inform implementation of solutions addressing syringe litter, OA is in the process of contracting with an evaluator to conduct an assessment of current levels of syringe litter in the areas where OCNEP will provide services. Findings will be used to assist CDPH and OCNEP to more effectively monitor efforts to decrease syringe litter, plan for syringe litter collection in vicinities served by OCNEP, and collaborate with the health department in expanding sharps disposal options.
CID also requests approval of the communications plan outlined below to inform the applicant and other
interested parties of the decision.

SUMMARY/PRO-CON ARGUMENTS:
Pros:
A review of OA and Office of Viral Hepatitis Prevention data identified Orange County as among the California counties most vulnerable to rapid spread of injection drug use-related HIV and HCV
infections.
Orange County Health Care Services has indicated that they will collaborate with OCNEP, if authorized, to address community concerns around syringe litter. Orange County had a 201% increase in newly-reported cases of chronic hepatitis C from 2011- 2015. Newly-diagnosed HIV cases per 100,000 population increased 24% between 2012 and 2016.
There is currently no syringe exchange program (SEP) operating in Orange County. Despite existing laws which permit it, the majority of pharmacies in Orange County will not sell syringes without a prescription.
Cons:

Law enforcement representatives oppose authorization (Attachments G and H).
The Orange County Board of Supervisors, the Santa Ana City Manager's office, and the Anaheim City Council oppose authorization; the Orange County Board of Supervisors passed a resolution opposing authorization (Attachment I).
A member of the Orange County Board of Supervisors stated to media that "...if the state authorizes the needle exchange, he intends to ask the Board of Supervisors to file a lawsuit to fight the action."
While additional effort is needed to address the sharps disposal issues typical of jurisdictions that are contending with a large population of homeless persons, OCNEP is an all-volunteer program and has limited resources to bring together all the potential coalition partners needed to implement comprehensive solutions.
There is community opposition largely framed around general opposition to all needle exchange programs, complaints about syringe litter found in a riverbed homeless camp eviction, concerns about the program acting as a "magnet" for drug users and homeless persons, and concerns that the proposed Costa Mesa location is perceived to be in proximity to schools. OCNEP operates in a jurisdiction currently struggling with a greater set of chailenges related to a large homeless population; issues specific to syringe services programs are frequently confounded with issues more broadly associated with homelessness.

EFFECTS ON EXISTING LAW: None.

ESTIMATED COST: None.

TIME FACTOR: California Code of Regulations, Title 17, Subchapter 15, SEP Certification, requires CDPH/OA to make final determination within 30 business days of the close of the public comment period.
CDPH 1058 (5/15)

Public comment closed on June 25, 2018. A decision to approve or not to approve the application must be issued by August 6, 2018._
BACKGROUND: As part of California's efforts to prevent the spread of HIV and other blood-borne diseases, California HSC Section 121349 and Business and Profession Section 4145 outline the mechanisms by which a SEP may be authorized to operate. Regulations that were approved in 2014 allow CDPH to authorize SEPs in locations where CDPH determines that the conditions exist for rapid spread of HIV or viral
hepatitis. Organizations that want to add syringe services may apply directly to CDPH/OA for authorization, rather than to their local county or city government. Applications must meet minimal requirements outlined by the law to be considered.

Trailer bill language was approved by the legislature and signed into the Enacted Budget by Governor Brown that accomplishes the following:
The January 21, 2019 sunset on CDPH's SEP authorization program is repealed;
Local health officers will continue to report on SEP activities to local authorities blennially instead of
reverting to annual reporting;
A new section of the Health & Safety Code is adopted that allows CDPH/OA to administratively
approve changes, within 30 days of a request from an SEP to the hours, locations, or service model (e.g mobile vs fixed site) of previously authorized SEPs, at the request of the SEP and without being subject to public notice requirements for programs seeking initial authorization;
The public comment period for new SEP applications is reduced from 90 to 45 days; and
The drug paraphernalia law is amended to provide for lawful distribution and possession of any materials CDPH deems necessary for disease prevention or public safety, such as "cookers" (bottlecap-like objects in which drugs are mixed prior to injection), which to date have not been funded through the OA Syringe Exchange Supply Clearinghouse.

According to 17 CCR 15, CDPH/OA must reject an application if it is incorrect or incomplete, if the applicant fails to meet the requirements outlined in HSC Section 121349 or if "evidence of projected harm to public safety, presented by local law enforcement official(s), is, in the department's judgment, greater than evidence of projected benefits to public health.*

Timeline

The OCNEP application to CDPH/OA was deemed provisionally appropriate, meaning that it met the baseline requirements outlined in law. OA posted the application on CDPH/OA's website on March 27, 2018 and announced the initiation of the public comment period.

OA posted the opportunity for public comment on the CDPH/OA web page, alerted the local health officer and law enforcement representatives for the cities in OCNEP's service area on the day that public comment opened, and provided them with the information about how to submit public comments. We reiterated the information in each of our phone consultations and re-sent the information by email after each of the consultations. Employees of the Cities of Santa Ana, Orange, and Costa Mesa publicized the public comment period. The applicant also publicized the public comment opportunity.

A total of 688 public comments were submitted during the 90-day period. Of these, 398 were in opposition and 290 were in support. Most of the opposing comments expressed general opposition to all SEPs, concerns about SEPs acting as a "magnet" for homeless people or criminals, and/or referenced the fact that Santa Ana had "shut down" OCNEP, citing this as evidence of the program's failure. Many of the comments specified concerns related to the SEP operating in perceived proximity to schools in Costa Mesa (Attachment K).
HSC Section 121349 requires CDPH/OA to consult with the local health officer and law enforcement leadership regarding reauthorization requests. OA completed telephone consultations with law enforcement
CDPH 1058 (5/15)

representatives from Anaheim, Orange, Costa Mesa, and Santa Ana, as well as with the local health officer
(Attachment G)

General Considerations

Among the concerns expressed by opponents to the Costa Mesa location is perceived proximity to schools. While one of the proposed OCNEP service locations is within the general vicinity of three Costa Mesa schools, it is primarily an industrial area - local businesses include Armstrong Petroleum Corporation, West
Newport Oil, Coast Sheet Metal and Store it Self Storage. Proximity to schools and children is the norm for most urban SEPs in the U.S. and California, partially because many syringe services are co-located in health departments and clinics that provide health and social services to individuals, families, children and teens.
To date, there is no scientific evidence that such proximity brings harm or risk to families or young people.

Based on public concern related to perceived proximity to schools, OCNEP has reduced the size of the proposed area of service in this location to a one-block area (17th Street from the outer border of the
Armstrong Petroleum Plant to Whittier Avenue) which is a 15-20 minute walking distance from the nearest
school's boundaries.

The Costa Mesa police department expressed concern about whether OCNEP can respond to political, law enforcement, and community concerns in a timely and collaborative manner. As an all-volunteer
organization, OCNEP faced challenges in being immediately responsive to concerns conveyed via email or voice mall. Additionally, some of the early organizers of OCNEP didn't demonstrate the relational skills needed to support respectful dialogue when facing controversy. The composition of the OCNEP advisory board has changed, with previous leadership now gone and new leadership instituting communication that, to date, has been responsive and collaborative. OA technical assistance staff have provided coaching and
trainining to OCNEP over the past 6 months on, among other topics, collaboration and communication, media relations, and strategies for engaging local health, law enforcement, and other authorities.

Communication Plan:

OA will notify law enforcement and the health officer of the decision and send the attached letter
(Attachment E).
OA will notify the applicant via phone after law enforcement and the health officer are notified. OA will
also send the attached letter to the applicant via email after completing the phone calls (Attachment
D).
OA will post the authorization announcement (Attachment F) on CDPH/OA's website after all notifications are completed. The announcement will be posted at: http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/aids/Pages/Applicationsopenforpubliccomment.aspx.

TO: Orange County Needle Exchange Program
SUBJECT: AUTHORIZATION OF THE ORANGE COUNTY NEEDLE
EXCHANGE MOBILE PROGRAM APPLICATION

Approval

This letter is to inform you that the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), Office of AIDS (OA) has authorized the Orange County Needle Exchange Program (OCNEP) to provide syringe exchange mobile services in four locations in Orange County, as proposed in OCNEP's application dated March 19, 2018.
CDPH, OA has determined that OCNEP's application meets the requirements outlined in Health and Safety Code Section 121349 and that there is a public health need for these services due to the significant risk for transmission of HIV and hepatitis C among people who inject drugs in Orange County. In making this determination, CDPH has identified Orange County as among the California counties most vulnerable to rapid spread of injection drug use-related HIV and HCV infections. Newly reported cases of chronic hepatitis C in Orange County increased 201% from 2011-2015, and the rate of newly-diagnosed HIV cases per 100,000 population increased by 24% between 2012 and 2016. The proposed services performed by OCNEP will play a crucial public health role in the prevention of blood-borne diseases, as well as offering support and linkage to critical medical care and social services.
This authorization is effective August 6, 2018 through August 6, 2020. OCNEP may apply for renewal before the end of the two-year period, and CDPH, OA may renew the certification, following consultation with local law enforcement officials and the local health officer.

Amendment to OCNEP Operations

In order to address the concerns conveyed during CDPH/OA consultation with local law enforcement and received during the public comment period, OCNEP has conferred with CDPH and requested that, if its application is approved, CDPH, OA amend the authorization to narrow the geographical location for services and enhance syringe litter clean-up efforts. Therefore, in accordance with Health and Safety Code section 121349,

Director's Office, MS 0500 • P.O. Box 997377 • Sacramento, CA 95899-7377 (916) 558-1700 • (916) 558-1762 FAX Internet Address: www.cdph.ca.gov t

subdivision (h), CDPH/OA is administratively amending the OCNEP authorization as
follows:

1) The geographical areas of service are narrowed: OCNEP is authorized to operate in the following times and locations:

1. Anaheim
Time: Mondays 2 p.m. to 5 p.m., and Thursdays 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. Location: Area bounded by the Riverside Freeway (California State Route 91), North Anaheim Boulevard, East La Palma Avenue, and North Olive
Street.

2. Costa Mesa
Time: Wednesdays 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., and Sundays 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Location: 17th Street from the outer border of the Armstrong Petroleum Plant to Whittier Avenue.

3. Orange Time: Tuesdays 2 p.m. to 5 p.m., and Fridays 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. Location: Area bounded by West Katella Avenue/West Struck Avenue, the Santa Ana River, West Orangewood Avenue, and Main Street.
4. Santa Ana
Time: Wednesdays 2 p.m. to 5 p.m., and Saturdays 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Location: Area bounded by East 4th Street, North Standard Avenue, Walnut Street, and North Grand Avenue.
2) As part of Increased and collaborative efforts to address syringe litter, OCNEP agrees to provide the following:
a. Work with the Orange County Health Care Agency to increase sharps disposal options, including purchase and placement of additional
disposal kiosks for the areas served by OCNEP;
b. Operate a hotline through which OCNEP will field reports of improperly
discarded syringes, or other community concerns, and
c. Conduct additional syringe recovery services including area sweeps in and around mobile service areas.

These amendments shall be effective immediately and are made in accordance with a
CDPH, OA determination that, with these amendments, OCNEP will continue to meet all
standards set forth in subdivision (d) of Health and Safety Code section 121349 and
that a public health need exists for such services within Orange County.
CDPH, OA will continue to work with the Orange County municipalities and OCNEP to address ongoing syringe litter collection issues. CDPH, OA is in the process of contracting with an independent evaluator to assess syringe litter in each locale, and will use the results of the survey to evaluate the potential impact of the program on syringe litter. Findings may be used to assist OCNEP in addressing community concerns, planning for syringe litter collection in vicinities served by OCNEP, and collaborating with the health department in expanding sharps disposal options.

TO: Chief Thomas Kisela, City of Orange; Acting Chief Julian Harvey, City of Anaheim; Chief David Valentin, City of Santa Ana; and Acting Chief Bryan Glass, City of Costa Mesa Dr. Eric Handler, Orange County Health Officer
SUBJECT: AUTHORIZATION OF THE ORANGE COUNTY NEEDLE
EXCHANGE MOBILE PROGRAM APPLICATION

The California Department of Public Health (CDPH), Office of AIDS (OA) would like to thank you for your participation in the consultation process and inform you that CDPH, OA has authorized the Orange County Needle Exchange Program (OCNEP) to provide syringe exchange mobile services in four locations in Orange County, as proposed in OCNEP's application dated March 19, 2018. This authorization is effective August 6, 2018 through August 6, 2020. OCNEP may apply for renewal before the end of the two- year period, and CDPH, OA may renew the certification, following consultation with local law enforcement officials and the local health officer.

CDPH, OA has determined that OCNEP's application meets the requirements outlined in Health and Safety Code Section 121349 and that there is a public health need for these services due to the significant risk for transmission of HIV and hepatitis C among people who inject drugs in Orange County. In making this determination, CDPH has identified Orange County as among the California counties most vulnerable to rapid spread of injection drug use-related HIV and HCV infections. Newly reported cases of chronic hepatitis C increased by 201% between 2011-2015 in Orange County, and the rate of newly-diagnosed HIV cases per 100,000 population increased by 24% between 2012 and 2016. There is currently no syringe exchange program in Orange County, and very few Orange County pharmacies provide non-prescription syringe sales. The services proposed by OCNEP will play a crucial public health role in the prevention of blood-borne diseases, as well as offering support and linkage to critical medical care and social services.

Amendment to OCNEP Operations

In order to address the concerns conveyed during CDPH, OA consultation with local law enforcement and received during the public comment period, OCNEP has conferred with CDPH and requested that, if its application is approved, CDPH, OA amend the

authorization to narrow the geographical location for services and enhance syringe litter clean-up efforts. Therefore, in accordance with Health and Safety Code section 121349, subdivision (h), CDPH, OA is administratively amending the OCNEP authorization as
follows:
1) The geographical areas of service are narrowed: OCNEP is authorized to operate in the following times and locations:

1. Anaheim
Time: Mondays 2 p.m. to 5 p.m., and Thursdays 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. Location: Area bounded by the Riverside Freeway (California State Route 91), North Anaheim Boulevard, East La Palma Avenue, and North Olive Street.

2. Costa Mesa
Time: Wednesdays 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., and Sundays 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Location: 17th Street from the outer border of the Armstrong Petroleum Plant to
Whittier Avenue.

3. Orange
Time: Tuesdays 2 p.m. to 5 p.m., and Fridays 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. Location: Area bounded by West Katella Avenue/West Struck Avenue, the Santa
Ana River, West Orangewood Avenue, and Main Street.

4. Santa Ana
Time: Wednesdays 2 p.m. to 5 p.m., and Saturdays 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Location: Area bounded by East 4th Street, North Standard Avenue, Walnut Street, and North Grand Avenue.

2) As part of increased and collaborative efforts to address syringe litter, OCNEP agrees to provide the following: a. Work with the Orange County Health Care Agency to increase sharps disposal options, including purchase and placement of additional disposal kiosks for the areas served by OCNEP; b. Operate a hotline through which OCNEP will field reports of improperly discarded syringes, or other community concerns, and
C. Conduct additional syringe recovery services in and around mobile
service areas.

These amendments shall be effective immediately and are made in accordance with a CDPH, OA determination that, with these amendments, OCNEP will continue to meet all standards set forth in subdivision (d) of Health and Safety Code section 121349 and that a public health need exists for such services within Orange County.
CDPH/OA will continue to work with the Orange County municipalities and OCNEP to address ongoing syringe litter collection issues. CDPH, OA is in the process of
contracting with an independent evaluator to assess syringe litter in each locale, and will use the results of the survey to evaluate the potential impact of the program on syringe litter. Findings may be used to assist OCNEP in addressing community

concerns, planning for syringe litter collection in vicinities served by OCNEP, and collaborating with the health department in expanding sharps disposal options.
Orange County faces multiple and overlapping public health challenges, and county, city, medical and social service partners have implemented a wide array of strategies to address these challenges. Providing syringe services that include linkage to HIV/HCV screening and care, substance use disorder treatment, and overdose education and prevention will amplify existing public health efforts.
CDPH's formal announcement will be posted shortly and can be found at: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DOA/Pages/OA_prev_secpapp.aspx
