Case 3:23-cv-01886 Document 1 Filed 04/04/23 Page 2 of 61 PagelD: 2

Complaint For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief Under the Marine

Mammal Protection Act, National Environmental Policy Act and

Administrative Procedures Act

Plaintiff SAVE LONG BEACH ISLAND ("Plaintiff") by its attorney

files this Complaint against Defendants United States Department

of Commerce, United States Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo,

National Marine Fisheries Service, and Director of the National

Marine Fisheries Service, Janet Coit, ("Defendants") and alleges

as follows:

NATURE OF THE ACTION

1. This is an action to reverse and set aside Defendant

National Marine Fisheries Service's ("NMFS") incidental

take/harassment authorizations, eleven active and five pending,

off the New York and New Jersey coasts, issued pursuant to 16

U.S.C. § 1361 et seq., the Marine Mammal Protection Act ("MMPA"),

as such authorizations, cumulatively, and even individually,

contravene 16 U.S.C. § 1371 (a) (5) (D), (i), (I), of the MMPA, and

moreover, constitute arbitrary and capricious agency actions

unsupported by substantial evidence in violation of 5 U.S.C. §

706 (2) (A) and (E) ("APA").

2. Plaintiff is seeking an order reversing and setting

aside Defendant's eleven active and five pending incidental

2

Case 3:23-cv-01886 Document 1 Filed 04/04/23 Page 3 of 61 PagelD: 3

take/harassment authorizations permitting offshore wind energy

development activities adjacent to the New Jersey and New York

coastlines, as violative of the MMPA and arbitrary and capricious

under the APA. A formal prayer is delineated infra.

3. In contravention of the MMPA, the eleven active and five

pending incidental take/harassment authorizations, cumulatively,

and even individually, take more than a "small number" of the North

Atlantic Right Whale and Humpback Whale species, and will have

more than a "negligible" impact on same.

4. The incidental take/harassment authorizations, active

and pending even considering their already impermissibly high

amount of requested takes determined the quantity of takes

arbitrarily, capriciously, and without substantial evidence by

significantly underestimating the maximum spatial extent of Level

B harassment noise emanating from survey vessels, as explained

further infra.

5. The incidental take/harassment authorizations, active

and pending, arbitrarily and capriciously assumed that the

authorized high-intensity noise activities would result in almost

exclusively Level B harassment takes, and virtually no Level A

harassment takes. This was arbitrary, capricious and unsupported

by substantial evidence. The incidental take/harassment

authorizations arbitrarily underestimate the potential for Level

A harassment takes from the noise exposure and cumulative noise

3

Case 3:23-cv-01886 Document 1 Filed 04/04/23 Page 4 of 61 PagelD: 4

exposure.

6. Moreover, Defendant also violates 16 U.S.C. §

1371 (a) (5) (D) (i) by issuing incidental take/harassment

authorizations to certain companies which do not maintain

headquarters in the United States or are otherwise unowned by

United States' citizens, in direct contravention of the language

of 16 U.S.C. § 1371 (a) (5) (D) (i) providing only U.S. citizens with

the legal pathway to obtain incidental take/harassment

authorizations.

7. Finally, pursuant to the National Environmental Policy

Act ("NEPA"), 42 USCS § 4332 (2) (C), the Plaintiff is seeking an

order from the Court to direct the Defendant to prepare an

environmental impact statement assessing the cumulative effects of

Defendant's issuance of the eleven incidental take/harassment

authorizations off the NY/NJ coasts. Such cumulative incidental

take/harassment authorizations (and likely soon issuance of five

pending incidental take/harassment authorizations) constitutes a

major federal action which significantly affects the quality of

the human environment, triggering the requirement of an

environment impact statement assessing cumulative effects, which

Defendant has neglected to perform, in contravention of 42 USCS S

4332 (2) (C) and the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. §

706 (2) (A) and (E).

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4

Case 3:23-cv-01886 Document 1 Filed 04/04/23 Page 5 of 61 PagelD: 5

8. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of

this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal questions), 28

U.S.C. § 1346 (United States as defendant), 16 U.S.C § 1361 et

seq. (Marine Mammal Protection Act), 28 U.S.C. § 2201 (declaratory

judgment), 42 USCS § 4321 et seq. (NEPA), and 5 U.S.C. § 701

through 706 (Administrative Procedures Act).

9. Final agency decisions are subject to judicial review.
Plaintiffs have met all applicable statute of limitations, namely,

the six-year statute of limitations, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2401.

10. Plaintiffs have standing to sue for the Defendant's
alleged violations of the Marine Mammal Protection Act ("MMPA")

through the Administrative Procedures Act ("APA").1 Plaintiffs

assert injuries that have occurred in the "zone of interests"

intended to be protected by the MMPA.2 The principal purpose of

the MMPA is to protect marine mammals,3 and as fully explained

infra under "Parties," Save Long Beach Island and Robert Stern

have legally protected interests in preserving marine mammals in

the waters off of New Jersey/New York, marine mammals which have

been increasingly dying as a primary result of Defendant's actions.

recent months is attributable to Defendant's incidental

take/harassment authorizations, as will be discussed further

infra. Finally, it is likely that the injury in fact suffered by

Save Long Beach Island and Robert Stern will be redressed by a

favorable decision. The same analysis of standing applies for NEPA.

Accordingly, standing is established for both MMPA and NEPA, and
Plaintiffs seek judicial review via the APA.

11. Plaintiffs have exhausted all administrative remedies

available to them. Plaintiffs submitted formal comments to

Defendant NMFS concerning their vessel survey approvals for three

disparate companies, Atlantic Shores, Ocean Wind, and NextEra

Energy. Plaintiffs further submitted formal comments to Defendant

NMFS on the Notice of Application by Atlantic Shores for their

incidental take authorization approvals for construction pile

driving and vessel surveys. Plaintiff also sent a letter to

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Administrator Rick

Spinrad and President Joseph Biden, regarding the vessel survey

issues. No response was received to the letter, and the Defendant

NMFS' responses to comments failed to address the issues discussed

in this action.

12. Venue is properly vested in this Court pursuant to 28
U.S.C. § 1391 (b) (2) because a substantial part of the events or

omissions giving rise to the claim occurred in this jurisdiction.

PARTIES

6

Case 3:23-cv-01886 Document 1 Filed 04/04/23 Page 7 of 61 PagelD: 7

13. Plaintiff SAVE LONG BEACH ISLAND is a 501 (c) (3) non-

profit corporation, of over 5,000 supporters, organized under the

laws of New Jersey, and created to guard human and natural

resources. These resources include, for example: marine mammals,

fish, and other species that inhabit, use, or migrate off the New

Jersey and New York coasts; the aesthetic elements of Long Beach

Island and the New York Bight; economic interests strongly tied to

the maintenance of the environmental features comprising Long

Beach Island and the New York Bight, inter alia. These resources

in particular, the marine mammals off the NJ and NY coasts, are

being harmed, harassed, and killed, in large part by the activities

authorized by Defendant in the waters of the NY Bight. These marine

mammals, not only are exceptionally important to the oceanic

ecosystems, but they also impart carbon dioxide mitigatory

effects. Save Long Beach Island supporters have a legally protected

interest in preserving the marine mammals, some of which, like the

North Atlantic Right Whale, are critically endangered species. The

Defendant NMFS' issuance of numerous permits to take thousands of

marine mammals runs directly counter to Save Long Beach Islands

mission and guiding purpose as an entity.

14. Plaintiff ROBERT STERN, Ph.D., is an individual

residing in Long Beach Island, New Jersey. He previously managed

the Office of Environmental Compliance in the United States

7

Case 3:23-cv-01886 Document 1 Filed 04/04/23 Page 8 of 61 PagelD: 8

Department of Energy. He is the president of Save Long Beach

Island, and believes it to be his responsibility to guard the

natural resources of Long Beach Island and the waters adjacent to

it, including the land animals, plants, and marine life. Dr. Stern

is concerned with all aspects of the wind turbine development

process, and one focus of this action is on the harmful preparatory

activities, in the form of seabed characterization which utilize

high intensity noise devices. This noise propagates outward from

the source vessel and disturbs, harasses, and even leads to deaths

of marine mammals off the NJ and NY coasts. The current rate of

whale mortality, based on the past three months, is unprecedented

in the record and highly statistically significant. Dr. Stern has

deeply researched the issue and has expertise in the field. As

such, he is very cognizant of the harms, both in the preparatory

and operational phases of the wind turbines. This ongoing noise-

based sea characterization threatens the unique marine life of the

Long Beach Island waters, and the place Dr. Stern has chosen to

call home. The Defendants' activities, thus, are resulting in harm

to Dr. Stern.

15. Defendant National Marine Fisheries Service is an agency

of the federal government, within the United States Department of

Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which
is empowered to issue incidental take/harassment authorizations

for specified human activities that result in takings of marine

8

Case 3:23-cv-01886 Document 1 Filed 04/04/23 Page 9 of 61 PagelD: 9

mammal species. Defendant Janet Coit is the director of the NMFS.

Defendant NMFS is an agency within Defendant United States

Department of Commerce, of which, Gina Raimondo is the Secretary.

STATUTORY FRAMEWORK

16. The NMFS, also known as NOAA Fisheries, is a United

States federal agency within the United States Department of

Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that is

tasked with management and stewardship of the United States marine

resources. The NMFS, one of the defendants in this action, is the

agency responsible for issuing incidental take/harassment

authorizations (hereafter referred to as "ITA") for wind energy

development activities adjacent to and off the coasts of New Jersey

and New York.

17. Various companies applied for, and thereupon received,

innumerable ITAs issued by the Defendant.

18. The guiding purpose of the MMPA, as established in 1972,

is to "prevent marine mammal species and population stocks from

declining beyond the point where they ceased to be significant

functioning elements of the ecosystems of which they are a part."4

19. Additionally, the Congressional declaration of policy as

4 Marine Mammal Protection Act Policies, Guidance, and Regulations, NOAA Fisheries (Mar. 22, 2023), https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine- mammal-protection/marine-mammal-protection-act-policies-quidance-and- regulations#:~:text=The%20Marine%20Mammal%20Protection%20Act%20was%20enacted&
20on%200ctober%2021, which%20they%20are%20a%20part.

9

Case 3:23-cv-01886 Document 1 Filed 04/04/23 Page 10 of 61 PagelD: 10

explicated in 16 U.S.C. § 1361(6) is consonant with that guiding

purpose:

marine mammals have proven themselves to be

resources of great international

significance, esthetic and recreational as

well as economic, and it is the sense of the

Congress that chey should be protected and

encouraged to develop to the greatest extent

feasible commensurate with sound policies of

resource management and that the primary

objective of their management should be to

maintain the health and stability of the

marine ecosystem. Whenever consistent with

this primary objective, it should be the goal

to obtain an optimum sustainable population

keeping in mind the carrying capacity of the

habitat.

20. However, somewhat paradoxically, the MMPA contains

provisions which permit the "taking" of marine mammal species for

certain periods of time, in defined geographical regions, if such

taking is not intentional, but rather, only "incidental" to another

specified activity.

21 . The term "take" within the meaning of 16 U.S.C. S 1362

(13) "means to harass, hunt, capture, or kill, or attempt to

10

Case 3:23-cv-01886 Document 1 Filed 04/04/23 Page 11 of 61 PagelD: 11

harass, hunt, capture, or kill any marine mammal."

22. Level A harassment is defined as, "has the potential to

injure a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild." 16

USCS § 1362 (18) (A) (i).

23. Level B harassment is defined as, "has the potential to

disturb a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild by
causing disruption of behavioral patterns, including, but not
limited to, migration, breathing, nursing, breeding, feeding, or

sheltering." 16 USCS § 1362 (18) (A) (ii).

24. 16 U.S.C. § 1371 "Moratorium on taking and importing

marine mammals and marine mammal products" sets forth the

relevant exceptions to the general prohibition on takings.

25. Specifically, 16 U.S.C. § 1371 (a) (5) (D), (i), (I) provides

in pertinent part:

Except as provided by clause (ii), upon

request therefor by citizens of the United

States who engage in a specified activity

(other than commercial fishing) within a

specified geographical region, the Secretary

shall allow, during periods of not more than

five consecutive years each, the incidental,

but not intentional, taking by citizens while

engaging in that activity within that region

of small numbers of marine mammals of a

11

Case 3:23-cv-01886 Document 1 Filed 04/04/23 Page 12 of 61 PagelD: 12

species or population stock if the Secretary,

after notice and opportunity for public

comment finds that the total of such taking

during each five-year (or less) period

concerned will have a negligible impact on

such species or stock and will not have an

unmitigable adverse impact on the availability

of such species or stock for taking for

subsistence uses pursuant to subsection (b) or

section 109(f) [16 USCS SS 1379 (f) ] or, in the

case of a cooperative agreement under both

this Act and the Whaling Convention Act of

1949 (16 U.S.C. 916 et seq.), pursuant to

section 112(c).

26. Note, in particular, the phraseology, "small numbers of

marine mammals of a species or population stock," and, "finds that

the total of such taking will have a negligible impact" and
that the Act refers to "citizens" engaged in a specified activity
in the plural and "geographical region" in the singular. These

clauses require the defendant to consider cumulative impact both

spatially and temporally and are particularly pertinent in the

case at bar, as will be discussed infra.

27. NEPA imposes a requirement that federal agencies, such

12

Case 3:23-cv-01886 Document 1 Filed 04/04/23 Page 13 of 61 PagelD: 13

as Defendant, assess the impact of major federal actions that

significantly affect the quality of the human environment, in an

environmental impact statement. 42 USCS § 4332 (2) (C) . The

assessment must include both individual and cumulative effects of

the major federal action. As explained in the third claim for

relief, infra, Defendants, failed to prepare the required

cumulative environmental impact statement on the major federal

action (see third claim for relief).

FACTS

40. In total, there are eleven active ITAs, as delineated

supra, and five pending ITAs, fully outlined in Clean Ocean

Action's6 letter to President Biden.

41. These ITAs (both active and pending) almost exclusively

requested Level B harassment takes.

42. Level B harassment takes include, "behavioral

disturbance or temporary [hearing] threshold shift)."7

43. As such, the classification of the ITAs issued

Case 3:23-cv-01886 Document 1 Filed 04/04/23 Page 16 of 61 PagelD: 16

explicitly concedes that the anthropogenic acoustic source

utilized in the wind turbine characterization surveys can result

in takings.

44. For example, the Orsted ITA provides, under "General

Conditions" subsection (e) : "The acoustic source must be

deactivated when not acquiring data or preparing to acquire data,

except as necessary for testing. Unnecessary use of the acoustic
source shall be avoided."8

45. Note, further, in "Mitigation Requirements Shutdown

Requirements" (e) (vii) : "Shutdown of acoustic sources is required
upon observation of either a species for which incidental take is

not authorized or a species for which incidental take has been

authorized but the authorized number of takes has been met,

entering or within the Level B harassment zone."9

46. Accordingly, the ITA verbiage itself recognizes the

impact of the anthropogenic acoustic sources on the marine mammals

authorized to be taken by the ITA.

47. In total, the eleven active ITAs permit 181 Level B takes

of North Atlantic Right Whales, 169 of Humpback whales, and 63,820

of total marine mammals. The five pending ITAs permit 782 takes of

Humpback whales and 229 of North Atlantic Right Whales. This is a

1,396 (up to 68.1%), and 411 of North Atlantic Right Whales out of

a population size of less than 350 in the NJ/NY area (up to 100%).
Such high takes likely involve multiple elevated noise exposures

to the same animal.

formed in 1978, that responds to animals in distress and provides

medical treatment. It is a 501 (C) (3) organization.10

49. The MMSC has collated historical data on New Jersey whale

strandings and presented same in graphical form. The below graph

depicts the whale strandings per year from January 1, 2002 through

53. For the period December 5, 2022 through January 7, 2023,

there were 4 New Jersey whale strandings. One of those four

strandings occurred in early January 2023 (as noted in the first

MMSC graph) . From January 7, 2023 through March 9, 2023, there

were an additional 6 New Jersey whale strandings (totaling the 7

NJ whale strandings for 2023 depicted on the above graph) .

54. Thus, there have been a total of 10 New Jersey whale

strandings for the period December 5, 2022 through March 9, 2023.

55 . The average whale mortality rate for the 2002-2022

multidecadal period in New Jersey is 6.3 whale deaths per year.

56. The estimated total New Jersey whale deaths were

calculated based upon the recent multi-month rate of mortality

events and extrapolated for the upcoming year. This yielded an

estimated total whale deaths of 39 whales for 2023.

19

Case 3:23-cv-01886 Document 1 Filed 04/04/23 Page 20 of 61 PagelD: 20

57. This number of whale deaths is not only greater in

quantity than the highest year of deaths in the 20 year MMSC

database, but it also constitutes a highly statistically

significant increase in whale deaths. Such a determination can be

quickly and easily performed. See the below graph depicting the

New Jersey whale deaths for the 2002-2023 period including the

extrapolated value for 2023, and statistical significance note

58. The extrapolated estimate of 39 NJ whale deaths for 2023

versus the baseline average constitutes a highly statistically

significant event, with the p-value well under 0.001, and a z-

score of 4.94.

59. These data indicate a highly rare, anomalous event is
underway. The p-value provides strong evidence that such an event

is unlikely occurring due to chance. The z-score indicates a near

5 standard deviation event, which again, is exceedingly rare. A

five standard deviation event corresponds to a 1 in 3.5 million

chance of happening.13

60. Additionally, a study funded by Defendant NMFS found
through an estimation model that - over the period 1990-2007
observed North Atlantic Right Whale carcasses account for only 36%
of all deaths.14 Adjusting for this implies the above estimate of

39 whale deaths for 2023 could be quite a bit higher.

61. In totality, the recent exponential uptick in whale

deaths is unprecedented in the NJ record since 2002, highly

statistically significant, and provides robust evidence that an

environmental variable is causing this dramatic increase. The only

common denominator, i.e., the recent changed variable of

significance, has been the spate of ITAs issued during 2022 in

connection with the wind energy marine characterization activities

off the New Jersey/New York coasts. The mechanisms and

corroboration for imputing the exponential whale mortality

increase to the wind energy activities is outlined infra.

62. Moreover, whales have not been the only victim of death.

There have already been a total of 23 dolphin and porpoise

strandings along the NJ coast for 2023 thus far, as per MMSC . 15 The

average number of deaths for the 2002-2022 is 42 (note that the

one anomalous year in 2013 was due to morbillivirus16 in dolphins
- a virus in the same family as measles).

63. The extrapolated total deaths for 2023 based upon the

current rate of dolphin/porpoise deaths in 2023 thus far is 104

deaths for 2023.

64 . As such, the estimate for 2023 of 104 deaths of

dolphins/porpoise versus the running baseline average of 42 deaths

would be highly statistically significant, with a p-value less

than 0.001, and a z-score of around 5, again, suggesting this is

an exceedingly rare event.

65. It further fortifies the argument that an

environmental/exogenous agent is responsible for this exponential

increase in mortality, and since the effect is observed across

multiple marine mammal species, namely, both whales and dolphins,

it must be a variable capable of affecting both cetaceans/marine

66 . A common denominator between dolphins and whales is

their utilization of sound as a means to communicate and navigate,

as discussed further infra.

C. Scientific Evidence Causally Linking the Wind Turbine

Marine Characterization to the Dramatic Increase in

Dolphin/Whale Deaths

67. While it cannot be foreclosed that more than one

etiological factor is causing the overall increase in marine mammal

deaths, if this were a multifactorial phenomenon, we should have

observed multiple changed variables over the preceding 12-16

months. That has not been the case.

68 . The one, materially changed variable has been the

numerous ITAs issued in 2022, and thereupon, the significant amount

of seabed characterization activity offshore, in preparation for

turbine construction.

69. The seabed is characterized by survey vessels which

emanate high magnitude noise, typically operating in the low-mid

frequency range.

70. Dr. Robert Stern, the former director in the Office of

Environmental Compliance in the U.S. Department of Energy, is a

recognized expert in environmental impact studies. He submitted a

23

letter, 17 on behalf of his organization, Save LBI, to President

Joseph Biden. This letter is replete with scientific data on the

potential deleterious effects of wind turbines on marine life,

both in the preparatory and operational phases.

71. The high magnitude noise emitted by survey vessels to

characterize the sea floor in preparation for turbines permits

noise levels over 200 decibels.18

72. The Defendant's own 2018 technical guidance19 shows the

various marine mammals, including whales and dolphins, hear in the

low to mid frequency range:

73. Defendant NMFS uses an established threshold for Level

B harassment at 120 decibels for continuous noise, and 160 decibels

for impulsive and intermittent noise20 which is characteristic of

noise source level of these vessel survey devices.

74 . The Defendant NMFS' issuance of the ITAs established a

maximum distance of 141 meters (slightly less than 1/10 of a mile)

from the sound source for Level B harassment noise.21

75. Conversely, Dr. Stern's analysis demonstrates that

noise levels over 160 decibels can extend outward to 16 miles, and

noise levels over 140 decibels up to 34 miles away from the

vessel.22 See below table (under paragraph 79) produced by Dr.

Stern. The large changes in the range of elevated noise occur

because the range is an exponential function of the noise source

level and transmission loss factor-measured in decibels.

76. The use of the 140 dB as a criterion is supported by its

recent use by the NMFS in the Atlantic Shores project request for

ITA authorization for construction.23 It is considered to be more

representative as the criteria for impulsive noise for baleen
whales as opposed to the 160 dB level, which is more appropriate

for the general marine mammal population.

77. The need to consider a lower criteria level is also

supported by field observation on bowhead whales. It has been

difficult to observe the direct response of right whales to man-

made noise because they are so critically endangered and sparse.

But bowhead whales are a close relative of the right whale and an

excellent proxy for assessing behavioral impacts to them.

Displacement of bowhead whales from air gun noise, another

impulsive source, has been shown to occur at received levels of

120 to 130 dB . 24

78. Compounding the concern over large ranges is that, as

shown below (paragraph 79), with a more accurate noise source level

and a more often used realistic, practical 15 dB noise loss factor,

the distances to meet even the 160 dB criteria are considerably

larger. Regarding noise source level, the plaintiffs questioned

the use of the defendant's 203 dB source level for the loudest

"Dura Spark 240 Unit" when measured data in a Report25 (Table 10)

they often use places the number between 209 and 213 dB. The

Plaintiffs questioned the defendant's use of a 20 dB noise loss

factor when 15 dB has been used in numerous other IHA's and even

recommended by the defendants for that purpose.

79. It is well known that discrete noise signals lose that

characteristic and become of a more continuous nature as they

travel longer distances due to variations in noise transmission

paths. This would seem to be especially applicable to those sources

with wider beamwidth, longer pulse durations, and higher pulse

repetition rates. The disturbance criteria for continuous noise is

120 DB, even lower than the 140 DB. See Dr. Stern's table below,

showing noise to 140 dB out to 13-34 miles and noise to 160 dB out

to 16 miles from sound source (in contrast to Defendant's numbers

only 1/10 of a mile from sound source for 160 dB).

83. The threshold of 140 decibels is particularly

significant. The Defendant NMFS has recently used that threshold

as the level at which 50% of the baleen whale population would be

disturbed, meaning a large percent of the whales could be disturbed

at lower levels.28

84. Supporting that, two studies found that Humpback whales

try to avoid the noise down to a level of 140 decibels.29

85. Moreover, there is a scientific consensus that whales

will consistently seek to avoid noise of approximately 160

decibels.30

86. As noted, noise of these levels emanating from the sea

characterization surveys can propagate many dozens of miles away

from the survey vessel, and the surveying is occurring directly in
or near the right whale migration zone.

87. Disturbing the whale's behavior can mean many things:

Case 3:23-cv-01886 Document 1 Filed 04/04/23 Page 32 of 61 PagelD: 32

It very often means first, that the whale will
seek to avoid the noise or "standoff" from it,
potentially in an undesirable direction or
location. In a migratory setting that could
mean obstruction of, or even blockage of that
migration. It could mean being driven towards
the shore seeking relief. It can also involve
the whale surfacing to seek a lower noise
level at the surface and becoming more
vulnerable to vessel strike. It can mean
separation of mothers and calves due to the
'masking" of their normal communications by
the vessel device noise, and such separation
can be fatal for the calf. It can also mean
the loss of its navigational capability,
cessation of feeding or mating, and the loss
of the ability to detect predators or oncoming
ships. Finally, because whales use sounds to
determine the very nature of their
surroundings, the effects may be much more
profound than that.31

88. Such paths to serious harm and fatality include

reactions to noise stimuli causing right whales to ascend and swim

just below the surface where they are more vulnerable to vessel

strike, not just from survey vessels, but from other vessels as

well. This behavior has in fact been demonstrated experimentally. 32

89. Another path to injury involves separation of calves

from mothers as a result of masking of their communication from

elevated noise levels. Such communications can employ low-

amplitude signals susceptible to auditory masking.33

90. The potential for such loss of mother/calf communication

was also presented in another study, 34 using a 150 dB source level

for a whale upcall, and a 15 dB loss factor, mother/calf

communications could be blocked out to a distance of 7.2 miles

from the sparker units' source noise levels of 211 dB.

91. Still another path occurs from the potential disruption

of the whale's migration since a primary migration corridor for
the right whale is concentrated near and even intersects part of

the survey area. That could occur from reactions to above Level B
exposures and/or masking of the whale's sound capabilities.

92. Reactions to above Level B exposures could also involve

stress and distress. An animal's perception of a threat may be

sufficient to trigger stress responses consisting of some

combination of behavioral responses, autonomic nervous system

responses, neuroendocrine responses, or immune responses.

93. Autonomic nervous system responses to stress typically

involve changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and

gastrointestinal activity, have a relatively short duration and

may or may not have a significant long-term effect on an animal's

fitness.

94. Neuroendocrine stress responses have been implicated in

failed reproduction, altered metabolism, reduced immune

competence, and behavioral disturbance. During a stress reaction,
if an animal does not have sufficient energy reserves to satisfy

the energetic costs of a stress response, energy resources must be

diverted from other normal functions, leading to distress

situation. This state of distress will last until the animal

replenishes its energetic reserves sufficient to restore normal

function. Studies in the Bay of Fundy found that noise reduction

from reduced ship traffic was associated with decreased stress in

North Atlantic right whales leading to a reasonable expectation

that some of its normal functions, including its migration, could

be impaired from higher level exposures.

95. The need to assess the impact on its migration from the

masking of the whale's communication is equally important. The

whales use sound to navigate along their migration. It also appears

that their migration is ided by their capability to communicate

with each other along the way.

96. The right whale's vocalizations are normally at the 125

dB rms level for low background noise, but can rise to 150 dB in

34

Case 3:23-cv-01886 Document 1 Filed 04/04/23 Page 35 of 61 PagelD: 35

the presence of high background noise. 35

97. A recent in-depth review of behavior response studies

identified36 a number of studies specifically associated with whale

traveling, migrating, and directional swimming.

98. Numerous other studies evince the detrimental effects of

anthropogenic underwater noise on marine mammals. For example,

"[a]nthropogenic noise can directly or indirectly affect many

marine organisms, causing auditory masking, leading to cochlear

damage, changing individual and/or social behavior, altering body

metabolism, and hampering embryogenesis."37 Auditory masking is a

phenomenon that occurs when the presence of one sound compromises

and affects the presence of another sound. 38

high-intensity anthropogenic noise is not a novel phenomenon, in
fact, it has been documented in studies for decades.

intensity sonar systems resulted in the strandings of sixteen

beaked and minke whales after the Navy ships passed by through the

to 205 dB, resulting in maximum received levels of 120 to 150 dB

104. Furthermore, many studies have deduced a possible causal

link between naval sonar operations and whale strandings:

Several papers have suggested that beaked
whales tend to strand when there are naval
operations offshore. Simmonds and Lopez-
Jurado (1991) reported on four mass strandings
between 1985-1989 of Cuvier's beaked whale
(Ziphius cavirostris) on the coast of
Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands that may
have been related to naval maneuvers. Frantzis
(1998) reported on another mass stranding of
12 or more beaked whales sighted over 38 km of
coastline during two days (May 12 and 13,
1996) in the Kyparissiakos Gulf in Greece.
There was no external sign of injury or
disease in any of these animals. Frantzis
(1998) concluded that the mass stranding was
associated with concurrent NATO sonar
exercise. The Frantzis paper stimulated the
NATO research center that conducted the sonar
tests to convene panels to review the data
(D'Amico, 1998). The NATO sonar transmitted
two simultaneous signals, one at 450-700 Hz

and one at 2.8-3.3 kHz at source levels of
just under 230 dB. This combined signal lasted
four seconds and was repeated once every
minute. The NATO analysis suggested close
timing between the onset of sonar

transmissions and the first strandings.44

105. A U.S. Court of Appeals 9th Circuit case found that the

U.S. Navy's low frequency sonar was harming marine mammals, and

ordered the U.S. Navy to develop new rules that would adequately

comply with the requirements of MMPA S 1371 (a) (5) (A) (i) (II) (aa)
for "least practicable impact" on said mammals.45

106. Importantly, an internal memorandum46 written by Sean

Hayes, Ph.D., the Chief of Protected Species at NOAA Northeast

Fisheries Service Center, sent to Brian Hooker (lead biologist at

Bureau of Ocean Energy Management) strongly warns of the numerous

deleterious impacts of turbine construction and operation on

marine mammals, including and especially right whales.

These risks occur at varying stages, including

construction and development, and include

increased noise, vessel traffic, habitat

modifications, water withdrawals associated

with certain substations and resultant

impingement/entrainment of zooplankton,

changes in fishing effort and related

potential increased entanglement risk, and

oceanographic changes that may disrupt the

distribution, abundance, and availability of

typical right whale food.

107. Various news and media outlets have been disseminating

the statements made by federal and state agencies to the effect

that no connection exists between the spate of whale/dolphin

strandings and the ongoing offshore wind turbine preparatory work.

108. NOAA asserts that there is no evidence to support

speculation attributing the whale deaths to the seabed

characterization related noise 47, presumably referring to evidence

of hearing organ damage.

109. However, necropsies do not often look for damage to

marine mammals' hearing organs and cannot show whether disturbance

from noise led to behaviors that can and do invariably lead to

injury and death, as described passim. Rather, that connection

needs to be plausibly made through a thorough examination of vessel

location, noise device use and power settings and other factors at

the times of the whale deaths.

110. Hence, to suggest there is no evidence of a connection

between the turbine preparatory activity and the strandings based

solely on the necropsies is misleading because such evidence is

neither looked for or can be found. Therefore, claiming it doesn't

exist is proof of nothing.

111. The NJ DEP has joined in this chorus of avoidance of

evidence, "As of March 2023, no offshore wind-related construction

activities have taken place in waters off the New Jersey coast,

and DEP is aware of no credible evidence that offshore wind-related

survey activities could cause whale mortality."48

112. For instance, a News 12 New Jersey article discussing

the NJ DEP's statement notes that necropsies have determined that

some whales died due to vessel strikes.49 But this is potentially

only the secondary cause of death.

113. NOAA further avers that these strandings have been

increasing since 2016 50 but that is not borne out by the graph in

paragraph 49. That graph shows low strandings in 4 of the last 7

years. Also, such an assertion fails to account for the exponential

increase in the rate of mortality events over the past 3-4 months
in the regions off of NJ/NY specifically authorized by Defendant

to conduct noise-based characterization.

114. In 2020, a series of 29 beaked whale

strandings/sightings occurred on the northern shores of Europe. 51

Experts then suggested the strandings were related to a military

sonar exercise.52 Among the research cited was a prominent

Australian study which found a "Strong association between beaked

whale stranding events with the presence of multinational naval

ASW training operations."53 Those operations used mid-frequency

sonar.

115. Finally, and additionally, given all the above, and as

stated by Dr. Stern in his numerous submitted comments in

connection with the ITAs, "The scope of the Level A and serious

injury/death analysis here is insufficient. The take numbers

generated under the level B analysis are low and not justified

compared to those using current scientific norms for estimating

noise propagation loss. The potential for Level A takes from

cumulative exposure has not been analyzed."54 The Defendant NMFS,

in the active and pending ITAs, are authorizing these ITAs with

virtually no requested Level A harassment takes. This flies in the

face of all the evidence of pathways to harm and death from

cumulative exposure to the noise, outlined herein, and the

exponential rise in marine mammal deaths attributable to same.

116. Accordingly, it is entirely counterfactual to assert

there is "no evidence" given the above.

Climate Change Mitigatory Ability of Whales is Significant

117. Finally, and importantly, Defendants, inter alia, will

argue that one of the primary goals of wind turbine development is

climate change mitigation. However, the final Environmental Impact

Statement for the Vineyard wind project states that there will be

"no effect" on climate change from these projects.55 Save LBI also

assembled and presented to the Defendant NMFS sea level rise data
from International Panel on Climate Change reports that show that
the impact of these projects will not reduce future sea level rise

at all, but only delay whatever is coming for a very modest time.

For the Atlantic Shores project that delay would amount to about

nine days, so the argument that these projects are necessary and

must proceed rapidly to save the planet does not hold seawater. 56

118. In fact, a Harvard University study that analyzed 28

operational wind farms in the US suggests that wind turbines can

impart an effect of warming temperatures, primarily through

enhancement of low-level atmospheric mixing and interruption of

radiative nighttime cooling. This net localized warming effect was

quantified in 10 other studies, cited therein.57 This warming

effect could be non-negligible at a continental scale, assuming a

very high amount of wind power, though less certain as to global
scale temperature impacts.58

119. Defendants and others advocating for turbines, also

fail to recognize the immense carbon sequestration capacity of

great whales. Each, single great whale sequesters 33 tons of carbon

dioxide (C02) on average, removing same from the atmosphere for

centuries.59

120. Whales have a multiplicative effect on phytoplankton

generation, which offset global C02 production levels by an

incredible 40% annually through capturing 30-50 billion metric

tons of C02 per year60 (occurs via CO2 fixation by phytoplankton) .
Thus, the destructive impacts of wind turbine surveying and future
operations on the whale population will in fact reduce the Earth's
inherent carbon sequestration abilities, through reducing whales
and by extension phytoplankton.
121. Conversely, it is estimated that all wind energy (on and
offshore) offsets CO2 by only 340 million tons annually. 61 Hence,

phytoplankton alone capture 147 times more CO2 than wind energy

annually. When one combines the multiplicative effect of whales on

phytoplankton (and whales themselves), the C02 offsetting effect

of whales and phytoplankton are very significant, and the latter

surpasses wind energy by an exceedingly high amount.

122. As per the International Monetary Fund, "If whales were

allowed to return to their pre-whaling number of 4 to 5 million-

from slightly more than 1.3 million today-it could add

significantly to the amount of phytoplankton in the oceans and to

the carbon they capture each year. At a minimum, even a 1 percent
increase in phytoplankton productivity thanks to whale activity

would capture hundreds of millions of tons of additional CO2 a

year, equivalent to the sudden appearance of 2 billion mature

trees."62

123. As depicted in the below image, whales play an integral

role in the Earth system carbon and oxygen flux, by facilitating

transport of nutrients, production of phytoplankton, and oxygen,

as well as reduction of carbon dioxide.

D. Violations of the MMPA have occurred because the

cumulative impact of the ITAs on marine mammals,

particularly North Atlantic right whales and Humpback

Whales, is more than a small number of the population,

and will have a greater than negligible impact on the

species, and, certain ITA applicants are not US citizens:

Violations of the APA have occurred, as the quantity of

requested takes were determined arbitrarily and

Case 3:23-cv-01886 Document 1 Filed 04/04/23 Page 47 of 61 PagelD: 47

capriciously by underestimating outward sound propagation

from vessels among other reasons, and by underestimating
the Level A harassment takes that are occurring; and,

violations of NEPA and APA for failure to prepare EIS

assessing the cumulative impact of ITAs

FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF
Violation of the MMPA, 16 U.S.C. § 1371 (a) (5) (D), (i), (I)

124. Plaintiffs hereby incorporate by this reference each

paragraph and allegation set forth above.

125. The MMPA provides, as noted supra, 16 U.S.C. §

1371 (a) (5) (D), (i), (I), that the prescribed activity must only take

"small numbers of marine mammals" and such harassment can only

have a "negligible impact on such species or stock."

126. The implementing regulations define "negligible" and
"small numbers" as follows, pursuant to 50 CFR 18.27:

"Negligible impact is an impact resulting from
the specified activity that cannot be
reasonably expected to, and is not reasonably
likely to, adversely affect the species or
stock through effects on annual rates of
recruitment or survival."

"Small numbers means a portion of a marine
mammal species or stock whose taking would
have a negligible impact on that species or
stock."

127. Cases interpreting these provisions, including analysis

of legislative intent and history, such as Ctr. for Biological

47

Case 3:23-cv-01886 Document 1 Filed 04/04/23 Page 48 of 61 PagelD: 48

Diversity v. Salazar, 695 F.3d 893 (9th Cir. 2012), have determined

that the "small numbers" and "negligible" clauses are two separate

and distinct standards. "Specifically, the "small numbers"

determination focuses on the portion of a species or stock subject

to incidental take, whereas the "negligible impact" analysis

focuses on the impact of the anticipated take."63

128. Therefore, the agencies issuing ITAs must "reasonably

determine through some other means that the specified activity

will result in take of only 'small numbers' of marine mammals. The

Service can analyze 'small numbers' in relation to the size of the

larger population, So long as the 'negligible impact' finding

remains a distinct, separate standard."64

129. As presented in paragraphs 25-26, the Act requires the

assessment of cumulative impact in determining small numbers and

negligible impact. The implementing regulations at 50 CFR

18.27 (b) (3), regarding scope, include a note discussing

"cumulative" impacts: "The information is being collected to

describe the activity proposed and estimate the cumulative impacts

of potential takings by all persons conducting the activity."

130. Hence, it's clear the intent of the statute is to assess

the cumulative impacts of takings.

131. The Defendants are also required to implement the MMPA

48

Case 3:23-cv-01886 Document 1 Filed 04/04/23 Page 49 of 61 PagelD: 49

using the "best scientific evidence available." Said science

demands the use of fact and mathematics. The fact is that the right

whale is seeking to migrate while being assaulted from numerous

vessel survey activities with noise levels that disturb its

behavior. Each such disturbance carries a finite mathematical

probability that that disturbance will result in serious harm or

fatality. It is the sum of those probabilities that determines

whether or not it can succeed in its essential migration, and

therefore whether there is a non-negligible impact to the species.

132. Therefore, both the law and the facts demand a cumulative

impact assessment, for the Defendant NMFS to act otherwise and to

determine impact on a piecemeal basis is contrary to the MMPA and

both arbitrary and capricious.

133. The cumulative impact of the issued, active ITAs for the

coastal waters of the NJ/NY region is such that it violates the

"small numbers" and "negligible impact" provisions of the MMPA.

134. The active ITAs granted by the Defendant total 182 takes

of North Atlantic Right Whales.65 The five pending ITAs66 currently

with Defendant will add an additional 229 takes of North Atlantic

Right Whales.

135. The Defendant's webpage places the current population

estimate of North Atlantic Right Whales at 350,67 and not all

migrate through NJ and NY coastal waters.

136. Thus, the 182 cumulative authorized takes of right

whales, given a local population estimate of less than 350, can

amount to more than 52% of the migrating population. If the pending

ITAs are issued (229 more takes), that percentage will be even

higher.

137. This is contrary to any reasonable interpretation or

dictionary definition of "small numbers" or "negligible impact."

138. The Merriam-Webster definition of "negligible" is: "so

small or unimportant or of so little consequence as to warrant

little or no attention."68 It is axiomatic that 52% of the migrating

population of an endangered species is far more than negligible.

139. Similarly, the Merriam-Webster definition of "small"

includes words such as: minor, trivial, of little consequence, and

limited. 69 This runs contrary to a determination on the order of

52% of an endangered species.

140. Moreover, as to Humpback whales, the eleven active ITAs
issued by Defendant off the NJ/NY coasts amount to 169 requested

takes70 of Humpback whales. Given a population size of 1,396, this

yields takes amounting to 12.1% of the total population of Humpback

whales. The five pending ITAs request takes of 782 additional

Humpback whales. This yields 951 total, or 951/1,396 = 68.1% of

the population.

Defendant's threshold of one-third for "small numbers" is not

supported scientifically nor consistent with case precedent. "A

definition of 'small number' that permits the potential taking of

as much as 12 percent of the population of a species is plainly

against Congress' intent." NRDC v. Evans, 232 F. Supp. 2d 1003

(N.D. Cal. 2002).

142. The Defendant states in its authorizations that when the

predicted number of individuals to be taken is less than one-third

of the species or stock abundance, the take is considered to be

"small numbers".71 This is extraordinarily high, particularly for

a critically endangered whale, and we can find no support for it

in the scientific literature, which suggests thresholds such as

2.5%72 and 1.0%.73

143. Therefore, the case law and science supports a "small

number" criteria less than 12 percent, which even some of

Defendant's individual ITAs would not meet. A level B take

percentage of 33.3 percent is unsupported legally, mathematically

and scientifically.

144. With respect to findings of negligible impact, the

Biological removal rate for the right whale is less than one animal

per year meaning that not one animal can suffer fatality from these

activities, in order to sustain the population.

145. In the face of hundreds of level B takes, to reach such

a negligible impact conclusion, the defendant would have to find

that none of them resulted in such a fatality. Given all of the

potential pathways to such an outcome described in paragraphs 87

through 105, such a conclusion would ignore numerous scientific

studies and evidence, and be both arbitrary and capricious. And in

fact, the defendant even on individual authorizations never

reaches such conclusions with that confidence but only speaks to

generalized expectations and anticipations.

146. Such a conclusion would conflict with the MMPA itself.

If hundreds of Level B Takes to a critically endangered whale is

innocuous, why does the law even require its assessment?

147. Additionally, given, as noted supra, the Defendant's

underestimation of the maximum extent of spatial propagation of

the noise emanating from survey vessels, and the uncertainty

regarding subsequent negative impacts to whales, including the

53

Case 3:23-cv-01886 Document 1 Filed 04/04/23 Page 54 of 61 PagelD: 54

potential for death (i.e., evidenced by the recent statistically

significant increase in deaths), Defendant's ITAs cannot be said

to unequivocally comport with the statutory directive prohibiting

an "unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of such

species." 16 U.S.C. § 1371 (a) (5) (D), (i), (I).

148. Furthermore, as explained supra, the issued ITAs

improperly determined, and significantly underestimated, the

requested quantity of takes, due to reasons outlined by Dr. Robert

Stern, such as, inter alia, underestimation of spatial extent of

sound propagation.74

149. Therefore, the ITAs were granted in contravention of the

MMPA, 16 U.S.C. § 1371 (a) (5) (D), (i), (I), since the cumulative

effect of the ITAs, and even individual ITAs, will take more than

a reasonably defined small number of the marine mammals,

specifically North Atlantic right whales and Humpback Whales, and

will have more than a negligible effect on the species. Defendant's

determination of the number of takes was discordant with the

statutory directive requiring only "small numbers" and "negligible

74 See, Exhibit B, Dr. Robert Stern's analysis and letter to President Biden.
The Defendant often cites measurement study which shows that Defendant
underestimates the magnitude/intensity of the source level noise from the
vessel surveys. Moreover, Defendant uses an improper noise loss factor (20
decibels) which overestimates the extent of noise dissipation from the
source. The end result is Defendant significantly underestimates the
propagation range to the 140+ and 160+ decibel criteria from the source,
noise which has been shown in studies to disturb whales (leading to many
negative impacts, including death). As discussed supra, Defendant assumes a
distance of 141 meters (slightly less than 1/10 mile) for Level B harassment
noise. Dr. Stern's analysis finds such noise can propagate to 16-34 miles
from the sound source.

impact."

150. Separately and finally, Defendants also violate 16

U.S.C. § 1371 (a) (5) (D) (i) by issuing ITAs (and considering pending

ITAs) to certain foreign national companies, violating the clear

statutory directive of (i), "Upon request therefor by citizens of

the United States who engage in a specified activity the

Secretary may specify, the incidental, but not intentional, taking

by harassment Only U.S. citizens are afforded the legal

ability to obtain ITAs. Of the eleven issued, active ITAs, and

Case 3:23-cv-01886 Document 1 Filed 04/04/23 Page 56 of 61 PagelD: 56

Violation of the APA

151. Plaintiffs hereby incorporate by this reference each

paragraph and allegation set forth above.

152. The APA, at 5 U.S.C. § 706(2) (A) and (E) provides that

agency action shall be held unlawful and set aside if it is

" (A)arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise

not in accordance with law;" and " (E) unsupported by substantial

evidence in a case subject to sections 556 and 557 of this title

or otherwise reviewed on the record of an agency hearing provided

by statute."

153. In issuing the eleven active ITAs, and five pending ITAs

with Defendant NMFS, the Defendant NMFS arbitrarily, capriciously

and without substantial evidence, determined the number of

requested takes. Defendant NMFS' requested takes were largely

based upon incorrect noise loss factors emanating from the vessel

source. Defendant NMFS has very frequently used, and even

recommended, a different, more reasonable "practical" noise loss

factor; 80 however, they do not employ the reasonable noise factor

in connection with these ITAs. Defendant NMFS' significant

underestimation of the maximum spatial extent of Level B harassment

noise constitutes an arbitrary and capricious agency action.

Defendant NMFS arbitrarily and without substantial evidence allows

80 See, Exhibit B, Dr. Robert Stern's analysis and letter to President Biden.

56

Case 3:23-cv-01886 Document 1 Filed 04/04/23 Page 57 of 61 PagelD: 57

wind energy companies to use a maximum spatial extent (from sound

source) Level B harassment distance of 141 meters. Even considering

the high number of requested takes in the ITAs (which violate the

MMPA), such requested takes are greatly underestimated due to the

above.

154. Moreover, and finally, the APA is violated because the

Defendant NMFS arbitrarily, capriciously, and without substantial

evidence, assumed virtually no Level A harassment takes would occur

(as can be seen in all the approved and pending ITAs - little to

no Level A takes were requested), This decision runs counter to

the mountains of evidence, supra, on how exposure, especially

cumulatively, to disturbance level noise can cause marine mammals

to suffer many detrimental effects, including injury and death.

The exponential increase in whale and dolphin deaths over recent
months, in concert with all the evidence discussed supra, is clear

evidence that Level A harassment takes are occurring (injury and

even worse - death). Yet, virtually no Level A takes were requested

in any of the approved and pending ITAs.

THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF
Violation of NEPA, 42 USCS § 4332 (2) (C), and APA

155. Plaintiffs hereby incorporate by this reference each

paragraph and allegation set forth above.

156. Pursuant to NEPA, 42 USCS § 4332 (2) (C), and as

57

Case 3:23-cv-01886 Document 1 Filed 04/04/23 Page 58 of 61 PagelD: 58

interpreted by case precedent, "In deciding whether a major federal

action will 'significantly' affect the quality of the human

environment, under § 102 (2) (C) of the National Environmental

Policy Act, the agency in charge, although vested with broad

discretion, should normally be required to review the proposed

action in the light of at least two relevant factors: (1) the

extent to which the action will cause adverse environmental effects

in excess of those created by existing uses in the area affected

by it, and (2) the absolute quantitative adverse environmental

effects of the action itself, including the cumulative harm that

results from its contribution to existing adverse conditions or

uses in the affected area."81

157. Moreover, agencies are not permitted to segment actions
into individual pieces, rather, they must assess major federal

actions cumulatively, "The Council on Environmental Quality

regulations require that 'cumulative actions' be considered

together in a single environmental impact statement. 40 C.F.R. §

1508.25 (a) (2) . "82

158. Here, the Defendant NMFS' final agency action by way of

issuing eleven individual ITAs off the New Jersey/New York

coastlines constitutes a major federal action which significantly

affects the quality of the human environment. As thoroughly

81 Hanly v. Kleindienst, 471 F.2d 823 (2d Cir. 1972) .
82 Thomas v. Peterson, 753 F.2d 754 (9th Cir. 1985).

58

Case 3:23-cv-01886 Document 1 Filed 04/04/23 Page 59 of 61 PagelD: 59

explained supra, the inordinate amount of requested takes of marine

mammals, including mammals listed as endangered species (e.g.,

North Atlantic right whale) in the individual and cumulative ITAs,

throughout the waters off NY/NJ, will satisfy both prongs of the

"significantly affect" standard delineated by case precedent. The

approved ITAs, and soon likely approval of pending ITAs, is causing

adverse environmental effects in excess of those created by

existing uses in the region (again, explained herein, passim) The

final agency action has also resulted in quantitative adverse

environmental effects, including cumulative harm, to marine

mammals, especially dolphins and whales.

159. As such, Defendant NMFS was derelict in its statutorily

imposed duty to assess the cumulative effects of a major federal

action significantly affecting the quality of the human

environment in an environmental impact statement, analyzing the

cumulative effects of the eleven issued ITAs.

160. This lack of cumulative assessment in an environmental

impact statement constitutes a violation of NEPA, 42 USCS §

4332 (2) (C), and violation of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2) (A) and

(E), as arbitrary and capricious agency action, and unsupported by

substantial evidence.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

59

Case 3:23-cv-01886 Document 1 Filed 04/04/23 Page 60 of 61 PagelD: 60

WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court:

(1) Enter an order reversing and setting aside National Marine
Fishery Service's eleven active ITAs issued for the New Jersey and

New York coastal regions as arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to

law, including the Marine Mammal Protection Act and Administrative

Procedures Act;

(2) Enjoin the Defendant NMFS from issuing the five pending ITAs

as such ITAs are arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law,

including the Marine Mammal Protection Act and Administrative

Procedures Act;

(3) Direct the Defendant NMFS to halt consideration of prospective

ITAs concerning wind energy projects in the New York/New Jersey

waters;

(4) Direct the Defendant NMFS to create an Advisory Board of

acoustic and marine mammal specialists with sufficient

independence to: (a) perform a thorough, transparent,

investigation of the potential causes of the recent statistical

anomaly of whale deaths; and, (b) develop noise impact estimation

protocols for use in future IHAs and ITAs; (c) That if that Board

finds that the vessel surveys are a plausible cause of the whale

deaths, require the Defendant NMFS to submit to the Court a revised

vessel survey program that includes measures to achieve the least

practicable adverse impact on the species. Such measures could

include the avoidance of surveys in primary whale migration

60

Case 3:23-cv-01886 Document 1 Filed 04/04/23 Page 61 of 61 PagelD: 61

corridors during primary migration months and a data sharing

Program among the different companies to avoid the need for

multiple vessels gathering essentially the same data.

(5) Direct the Defendant NMFS to prepare an environmental impact

statement assessing the cumulative impacts of the ITAs pursuant to

NEPA.

(6) Award Plaintiffs' reasonable attorneys' fees and costs under

the Equal Access to Justice Act; and

(7) Provide such other and further relief as the Court may deem

just.
