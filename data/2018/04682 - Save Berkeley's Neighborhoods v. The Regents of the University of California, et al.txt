Plaintiff Save Berkeley's Neighborhoods alleges:

2 1. Education Code section 67504 provides that "The Legislature further finds and declares that the

4 expansion of campus enrollment and facilities may negatively affect the surrounding environment.
5 Consistent with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), it is the intent of

6 the Legislature that the University of California sufficiently mitigate significant off-campus impacts
7

8 related to campus growth and development."

2. Public Resources Code section 21080.9 requires that the University of California, Berkeley
10 . (UCB) "consider the environmental impact of academic and enrollment plans" pursuant to CEQA and
11

12 "that any such plans shall become effective for a campus ... only after the environmental effects of those
13 plans have been analyzed" as required by CEQA.
14 3. In 2005, UCB adopted a Long Range Development Plan (2020 LRDP) to achieve a number of
15

16 objectives through the year 2020, including stabilizing enrollment. In or about 2005, UCB certified a
17 Final Environmental Impact Report for the 2020 LRDP (2005 EIR) pursuant to CEQA. The 2020 LRDP
18 and 2005 EIR projected that by 2020 student enrollment at UCB would increase by 1,650 students, from
19

20 the 2001-2002 two-semester average headcount of 31,800 to 33,450 students. The 2020 LRDP and 2005

21 EIR also projected that by 2020 UCB would add 2,500 beds for students.
22 4. On October 30, 2017, UCB responded to the City of Berkeley's request for information regarding 23

24 enrollment increases. This response shows the actual increase in student enrollment above the 2001-02
25 two-semester average for the most recent two-semester period (i.e., Spring 2017 and Fall 2017) is 8,302
26 students. This is an increase of 6,652 students more than the increase of 1,650 students projected in the 27

28 2020 LRDP and 2005 EIR, representing a five-fold increase compared to the 1,650 enrollment increase
29 projected in the 2020 LRDP and 2005 EIR. The response also shows UCB has built fewer than 1,000
30 beds.

5. The increase in student enrollment over and above the 1,650 additional students projected by the
2 2020 LRDP and included in the 2005 EIR's environmental impact analysis (hereinafter the "excess
3

4 increase in student enrollment") has caused and continues to cause significant adverse environmental

5 impacts that were not analyzed in the 2005 EIR. Plaintiff is informed and believes and on that basis

6 alleges that these impacts include, without limitation, increased use of off-campus housing for and by
7

8 UCB students, leading to increases in off-campus noise and trash; displacement of tenants resulting in

9 more homeless individuals living on public streets and in local parks; increases in the number of UCB
10 students who are homeless; increases in traffic and transportation related congestion and safety risks; and 11

12 increased burdens on the City of Berkeley's public safety services, including police, fire, ambulance, and
13 Emergency Medical Technician services.
14 6. Respondents have had and continue to have legal obligation to analyze the environmental
15

16 effects of the excess increase in student enrollment pursuant to CEQA, including, without limitation, by
17 preparing and certifying an Environmental Impact Report to assess the significance of impacts caused by
18 the extraordinary increase in enrollment and to identify and adopt mitigation measures to reduce these
19

20 significant impacts.

8 26. Plaintiff hereby realleges and incorporates the preceding paragraphs of this First Amended
9

10 Petition and Complaint as though set forth herein in full.

11 27. Since the 2007-2008 academic year, the Regents have implemented and continue to implement a
12 policy to increase student enrollment at UCB beyond the 1,650 additional students projected by the 13

14 2020 LRDP without subjecting the excess increase in student enrollment to the procedures and
15 requirements of CEQA; without analyzing the excess increase in student enrollment pursuant to CEQA,
16 and without preparing and certifying an Environmental Impact Report to assess the significance of 17

18 impacts caused by the excess increase in student enrollment; by failing to identify and adopt mitigation

Re: Notice of Intent to Sue Regarding Inadequate CEQA Review of UC Berkeley's 2020 Long Range Development Plan.

Dear Chancellor Christ and Regents of the University of California:

This office represents Save Berkeley's Neighborhoods with respect to the University of California at Berkeley's legal obligations to conduct environmental review of the 2020 Long Range Development Plan (2020 LRDP) in compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).

One of the 2020 LRDP's objectives is to stabilize enrollment. (2020 LRDP, Environmental Impact Report (2004 EIR), p. 3.1-10.) The 2004 EIR evaluated an increase in enrollment of 1,650 students above the 2001-02 two-semester average. (2004 EIR, p. 3.1-14.) The University's October 30, 2017, response to the City of Berkeley's request for information regarding enrollment increases shows an actual increase of 8.302 enrolled students above the 2001-02 two-semester average for the most recent two-semester period (i.e., Spring 2017 and Fall 2017). (Exhibit 1.) This represents a five-fold increase compared to the 2004 EIR's projection of a 1,650 student increase in enrollment.
This change in the project renders the 2004 EIR informationally defective because the EIR does not assess the impact of the actual increase in enrollment, which is orders of magnitude higher than the 1,650-student increase projected in the 2004 EIR. As a result, the University must prepare a supplemental or subsequent EIR to assess the significance of impacts caused by this extraordinary increase in enrollment and to identify and adopt mitigation measures to reduce these significant

impacts.

This letter provides notice pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.5 that on or
before April 20, 2018, Save Berkeley's Neighborhoods intends to file a lawsuit challenging the University's adoption of the 2020 LRDP on grounds the adoption does not comply with CEQA.
Save Berkeley's Neighborhoods is willing to discuss settling this dispute without the need for litigation. At a minimum, any such settlement must include: (1) an enforceable agreement by the University to prepare and certify a new EIR to assess the impacts of the 2020 LRDP as its project description has changed to reflect the increases in enrollment shown in the University's October 30, 2017, response to the City's request for information; (2) the new EIR must use the same environmental baseline used in the 2004 EIR; and (3) tolling the statute of limitations so that Save Berkeley's Neighborhoods is not forced to file its lawsuit to protect against the statute of limitations.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Very Truly Yours,
