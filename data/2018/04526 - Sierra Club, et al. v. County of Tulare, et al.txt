1.
26 SIERRA CLUB, CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY, and ASSOCIATION

27 OF IRRITATED RESIDENTS (collectively, "Petitioners") petition this Court for a writ of mandate a

28 and Order under Code of Civil Procedure $1094.5 and §1085, directed to Respondents, COUNTY OF

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

TULARE and TULARE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS, (collectively, "Respondents" or the

2 "County"), setting aside Respondents' certification of an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for an
3 Animal Confinement Facilities Plan ("ÄCFP") and the related General Plan Amendment and zoning
4 change, and approval of a Dairy Feedlot and Dairy Climate Action Plan ("CAP") (collectively, the
5

6 "Project").

7 2. As set forth below, Petitioners contend Respondents violated the California

8 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") because, inter alia, the EIR fails to adequately describe the

9 Project baseline, and does not include adequate and enforceable mitigation measures.
10 II. THE PARTIES
11 3. Petitioner and.Plaintiff, SIERRA CLUB, is a California non-profit membership
12 organization that is concerned with protection of the environment and govemment compliance with 13

14 environmental laws. Some members of the Sierra Club reside or work in Tulare County, in the vicinity

15 of the project. Sierra Club brings this action on its own behalf, for its members, and in the public

16 interest.

17 4. Petitioner and Plaintiff the CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY ("Center") is a

18 non-profit, public interest corporation with over 63,000 members with offices in San Francisco, Los
19 Angeles, and Joshua Tree, California, as well as offices in Arizona, Florida, Hawaii, Mexico,
20

21 Minnesota, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C. The Center and its

22 members are dedicated to protecting diverse native species and habitats through science, policy,

23 education, and environmental law. Center members reside in and own property throughout California

24 as well as Tulare County. The Center and its members would be directly, adversely and irreparably
25 harmed by the Projects and its components, as described herein, until and unless this Court provides
26 the relief prayed for in this petition. The Center brings this action on its own behalf, for its members,
27
and in the public interest.
28
2

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

5. Petitioner and Plaintiff the ASSOCIATION OF IRRITATED RESIDENTS ("AIR") is
2 a non-profit, public interest California corporation based in Kern County. AIR formed in 2001 to
3

4 advocate for clean air and environmental justice in San Joaquin Valley Communities. AIR has several

5 dozen members who reside in Kern, Tulare, Kings, Fresno, and Stanislaus Counties. AIR members,

6 through themselves, their families, and friends, have direct experience with the many health impacts

7 that arise from the type of pollution emissions associated with the Project. AIR brings this action on

8 its own behalf, for its members, and in the public interest.

9 6. Respondent and Defendant, County of Tulare, is a local govemnment agency and
10 subdivision of the State of California charged with authority to regulate and administer land use and
11 development within its territory, but only in compliance with the duly adopted provisions of its
12

13 zoning ordinances, General Plan, and all applicable provisions of state law, including the California

14 Environmental Quality Act, the Planning and Zoning law, and the Subdivision Map Act.

15 7. Respondent and Defendant Tulare County Board of Supervisors is the legislative body

16 and highest administrative body of the County. The Board has the authority to approve the ACFP,

17 CAP, and is responsible for amendments to the County General Plan and zoning laws, and the
18 certification of the EIR in this case.
19
III. PROCEDURAL ALLEGATIONS
20

21 8. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant action

22 and have exhausted any and all administrative remedies to the extent required by law, by inter alia,

23 submitting written comments on the Project and its environmental review at every step of the

24 administrative review process.

25 9. Petitioners have requested that the County not approve the Project until and unless it
26 has adequately analyzed environmental impacts from this Project and argued forcefully that the
27

28 Project must consider and adopt feasible mitigation measures that reduce significant environmental

3

PETITION FOR PEREMPTOR Y WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

effects. Any further attempts to pursue administrative remedies would be futile.

2 10. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
3 21167.5 by providing written notice of the commencement of this action to Respondents prior to filing
4 this petition and complaint. A true and correct copy of the Notice to Intent to Commence Litigation is n
6 attached hereto as "Exhibit A".

7 11. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

8 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 by mailing a copy of the Petition/Complaint to the

9 state Attorney General.
10 12. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
11 21167.6 by concurrently notifying Respondents of Petitioners' election to prepare the record of
12

13 administrative proceedings relating to this action.

14 13. Petitioners have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law

15 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandäte to require Respondents to comply with their

16 duties and set aside the approval of the project until they have prepared a legally sufficient EIR. In the
17 absence of such remedies, Respondents' approvals will remain in effect in violation of CEQA.
18 14. If Respondents are not enjoined from approving the Project, and from undertaking acts
19 in furtherance thereof, Petitioners will suffer irreparable harm from which there is no adequate remedy 20

21 at law in that the Project area and surrounding areas would be irrevocably altered and significant

22 adverse impacts on the environment would occur. Petitioners and the general public have also been

23 harmed by Respondents' failure to provide an environmental document that accurately and fully
24 informs interested persons of the Project's impacts.
25 15. In pursuing this action, which involves enforcement of important rights affecting the
26 public interest, Petitioners will confer a substantial benefit on the general public, residents of Tulare
27

28 County and the State of California, and will therefore be entitled tó attorneys' fees and costs pursuant

4

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 to, inter alia, Code of Civil Procedure §1021.5.

2 16. Petitioners bring this action in part pursuant to Public Resources Code $21168.5 and
3 Code of Civil Procedure §1085 or §1094.5, which require that an agency's approval of a project be set

aside if the agency has prejudicially abused its discretion. Prejudicial abuse of discretion occurs either
5

6 where an agency has failed to proceed in a manner required by law or where its determination or

7 decision is not supported by substantial evidence. Respondents have prejudicially abused their

8 discretion because Respondents have failed to proceed according to the law, and their decision is not

9 supported by substantial evidence.
10 III. STATEMENT OF FACTS
11 17. The dairy industry in Tulare County is a multi-billion dollar industry. DIER at p. 53.
12

13 According to the County, the ACFP was intended to "revise the way dairies are regulated..." County

14 Findings, at 564. More specifically, the ACFP is intended to streamline local permitting for new and

15 expanded dairies, and to "improve the way dairies and other bovine confinement facilities and

16 regulated…." Ibid.

17 18. In other words, the changes implemented by the ACFP were intended to make approval
18 of new or expanded dairies quicker and easier. These revisions were also intended to make it easier to
19 keep track of existing dairies. The EIR admits that the County has been unable to ensure that all
20

21 existing animal confinement operations are operating with valid permits and have undergone

22 expansions with valid approvals. DIER at 18, 47

23 19. In connection with the ACFP, the County also prepared a dairy and feedlot CAP, which

24 includes an inventory of greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions for the year 2013, which the County has
25 selected as the "baseline year" for the purpose of environmental review. The CAP also includes GHG
26 forecasts for the year 2023, and includes certain GHG reduction strategies and measures intended to
27

28 facilitate the streamlining approval of new and expanded dairies. Ibid.

5

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 20. The County's adoption of the ACFP included adoption of a General Plan amendment

2 and corresponding zoning amendment. (Zoning Amendment No PZC 17-040).
3 21. The County also prepared and certified a programmatic EIR, and adopted CEQA
4
findings and a Statement of Overriding Considerations. 5
22. The Project area includes the western approximate one-third of Tulare County, and
contains almost all of the County's animal confinement facilities. The County itself includes a diverse

g geography which includes Sierra Nevada peaks on the east, which turns to westerly foothills

9 transitioning gradually to the floor of San Joaquin Valley floor, where most of the animal confinement
10 facilities are located. CEQA Findings, at p. 565.
11 23. While the ACFP and the EIR claim the ACFP was intended at least in part to help the
12

13 County better regulate the existing dairies, the evidence in the record shows the County was primarily

14 concerned with facilitating "growth in the dairies and feedlots (bovine facilities) through expansion of

15 existing facilities and the establishment of new facilities for a ten-year period between 2013 and

16 2023." Ibid.

17 24. The County claims the total bovine head count have hovered around slightly higher
18 than 1 million, but hopes and expects the ACFP would help increase this number to about 1.2 million
19

20 by 2023. According to thè EIR, on the total projected growth is limited in part by siting constraints

21 that limit the number of new and expanding feedlots to approximately 80,493 acres throughout the

22 County. Ibid. Significantly, however, the County has made it clear that it does not intend to impose

23 any limits on dairy expansions even if the total growth by 2023 were to exceed the targeted 1.5%

24 growth. The ACFP and the EIR's description and discussion of the 1.5% growth rate are unclear and
25 inconsistent. While at times the EIR claims the 1.5% growth rate is nothing but a projection, the
26 EIR's consideration and ultimate rejection of a 1% growth rate alternative shows the County and the
27

28 EIR considered the 1.5% growth rate not to be merely a projection, but a intended target.

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 25. Through the ACFP the County exempts the expansions of existing bovine facilities

2 from further CEQA review which qualify for 'streamlined review'. DIER at p. 47-49. Procedurally,
3 the ACFP adds a new process for County authorization of existing dairies and other bovine facilities,
4
4no by eliminating case-by-case CEQA review and considerably relaxed mitigation and compliance
requirements for facility expansions. DIER at p. 50. The 'streamlined' CEQA analysis fails to set

7 concrete predictable, enforceable and reliable mitigation requirements or benchmarks for proposed

8 facility expansions in that it requires applicants only to incorporate the ACFP emissions reduction

9 strategies (as mitigation for climate change impacts) only "to the extent possible" in order to qualify
10 for the streamlined CEQA analysis. FEIR at pp. 17-18.
11 CEOA Mandates
12
26. CEQA was enacted to require public agencies and decision-makers to document and 13

14 consider the environmental implications of their actions before formal decisions are made. Public

15 Resources Code ("Pub. Res. C. §21000, and to "[e]nsure that the long-term protection of the
16 environment shall be the guiding criterion in public decisions." Pub. Res. C. §21001(d) "CEQA was

17 intended to be interpreted in such a manner as to afford the fullest possible protection to the
18 environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory authority." 14 California Code of
19
Regulations, (hereinafter cited as "CEQA Guidelines") §15003(f), citing Friends of Mammoth v. 20

21 Board of Supervisors, (1972) 8 Cal. 3d 247. "[T]he overriding purpose of CEQA is to ensure that

22 agencies regulating activities that may affect the quality of the environment give primary

23 consideration to preventing environmental damage. CEQA is the Legislature's declaration of policy

24 that all necessary action be taken 'to protect, rehabilitate and enhance the environmental quality of the
25 state. Save our Peninsula v. Monterey County Board of Supervisors (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 99, 117,

27

28 392; and Pub. Res. C. §21000.

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 27. The lead agency must identify all potentially significant impacts of the project, and

2 must therefore consider all the evidence in the administrative record. Pub. Res. C. §21080 (c), (d),
3 §21082.2. CEQA Guidelines direct lead agencies to conduct an Initial Study to "determine if the

5 project may have a significant on the environment." CEQA Guidelines §15063(a). "All phases of the

6 project planning, implementation, and operation must be considered in the Initial Study", CEQA

7 Guidelines §15063(a)(1). Besides the direct impacts, the lead agency must also consider reasonably

8 foresecable indirect physical changes in the environment in the area in which significant effects would
occur, directly or indirectly. See CEQA Guidelines §15064(d) & §15360, see, also, Laurel Heights
10 Improvement Assn, supra, 47 Cal. Ed at 392.
11
28. An indirect impact is physical change in the environment, not immediately related to
12

13 the project in time or distance, but caused indirectly by the project and reasonably foreseeable. CEQA

14 Guidelines §15064(d)(2) and §15358(a)(2). Indirect impacts to the environment caused by a project's

15 economic or social effects must be analyzed if they are "indirectly caused by the project, are

16 reasonably foreseeable, and are potentially significant." CEQA Guidelines §15064(d)-(e). A lead

17 agency may not limit environmental disclosure by ignoring the development or other activity that will
18 ultimately result from an initial approval. City of Antioch v. City Council (1986) 187 CA3d 1325
19
(emphasis added).
20

21 29. Where the CEQA environmental process was procedurally or substantively defective,

22 reviewing courts may find prejudicial abuse of discretion even if proper adherence to CEQA mandates

23 may not have resulted in a different outcome. Pub. Res. C. §21005(a). For example, the Court in

24 Citizens to Preserve Ojai v. County of Ventura (1985) 176 Cal.App.3d 421, 428 held that the
25 certification of an EIR that had not adequately discussed the environmental impacts of the project
26 constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion even if strict compliance with the mandates of CEQA
27

28 would not have altered the outcome. The Court in Resource Defense Fund v. LAFCQ (1987) 191

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Cal.App.3d 886, 897-8, went so far as to declare that failure to comply with CEQA procedural

2 requirements was per se prejudicial. The court in Kings County Farm Bureau v. City of Hanford
3 (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692 explained that an agency commits prejudicial error if "the failure to
4

5 include relevant information precludes informed decision making and informed public participation,

6 thereby thwarting the statutory goals of the EIR process." Id. at 712.

7 30. CEQA's environmental review process is intended to provide the public with assurances

g that "the agency has, in fact, analyzed and considered the ecological implications of its actions."
9 Laurel Heights Improvement Ass. v. Regents of the University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3rd 376,
10 392. The function of the environmental review, then, is not merely to result in informed decision
11 making on the part of the agencies, it is also to inform the public so they can respond to an action with 12

13 which they disagree. Id.

14 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (Violations of CEQA)

16 31. Petitioner refers to and incorporates herein by this reference all preceding paragraphs of

17 this Petition as though fully set forth herein.

18 32. The EIR violates CEQA because it fails to adequately describe the Project's
19 environmental baseline. The EIR claims it conservatively relied on a 2013 bovine head count, which
20

21 according to the County, was the highest recent head count in the County. The evidence in the record,

22 however, demonstrates that the EIR's estimate of bovine head count is unreliable. The ACFP would

23 replace the County's existing method of determining heard size based on waste by-product control,

24 which the EIR admits is inherently inaccurate. CEQA Findings at p. 565. Moreover, the EIR admits

25 that the County is currently unware of all existing operating or expanded dairies and feedlots, and
26 hopes implementation of the ACFP would incentivize heretofore unlawful dairies to come forward
27 and apply for a special use certificate. Thus, the County hopes to eventually come up with an accurate
28

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

tally, but fails to explain why instead of making feasible efforts to come up with accurate head counts,

2 it chose to rely on data it knew to be unreliable. The EIR, moreover, fails to adequately explain how
the 2013 head-count was calculated or provide adequate estimates for a complete and accurate bovine
4 head count. This evidence shows that the County is aware that the EIR's analysis is based on
5

6 inherently unreliable estimated head count.

7 33. The County's proposed mitigation measures for addressing biological impacts, air

8 quality, water quality, aesthetic impacts, and climate change are unlawful and inadequate. The County

9 impermissibly defers the formulation of mitigation measures without adopting any meaningful
10 thresholds of significance to address the Project's expected impacts on water quality, biological
11 resources, aesthetics, air quality and climate change.
12
34.
13 Likewise, the County's approach to mitigation of impacts, which gives the County and

14 the applicants under the plans virtually unfettered discretion to reject certain (Category A) mitigation

15 measures as infeasible without public participation or oversight also violates CEQA. The County and

16 the EIR fail to explain who will decide whether certain category A measures are infeasible, or how (by

17 what standard) this decision would be made.
18 35. The County, moreover, violated CEQA by improperly deferring the formulation of
19

20 GHG reduction mitigation measures without adopting a meaningful threshold of significance or

21 performance standard or a commitment to ensuring GHG emissions would be adequately mitigated.

22 As the Final EIR explains, "a proposed expansion must incorporate, to the extent possible, the

23 Category A emissions reduction strategies, listed in Table 5 on 5 pages 34- 35, that are applicable based

24 on the scope of the proposed expansion. To the extent that any of such Category A strategies would be
25 infeasible or impracticable based on the specifics of the expansion, a Category B strategy, listed in
26

27 Table 6 on pages 35-36, must be substituted for each such strategy." FEIR at p. 2-18. Thus, although

28 the ACFP includes a set of preferred mitigation measures (Category A), it is impossible to project

10

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

whether and to what extent future new and expanded projects under the ACFP would be approved

2 with all or mostly Category B mitigation measures. Accordingly, there are no enforceable mitigation
3 measures and no thresholds of significance to guide the future formulation of project-specific
4
mitigation measures.
n
6 36. The County's so-called streamlined approach to future project approvals under the

7 ACFP and CEQA compliance is inadequate and unlawful. Pursuant to this approach, projects that

8 nominally meet certain criteria can evade environmental review by tiering on the ACFP Final EIR.

Thus, the County's process would exempt an unknown number of projects from environmental review
10 without setting up adequate guidelines or procedures to ensure these project's environmental impacts
11 are adequately analyzed and mitigated. According to ACFP § 2.6.2 Environmental Review,
12

13 applicants for new bovine facilities and bovine facility expansions special use permits may be

14 "required to provide such technical reports, as applicable, which the Resource Management Agency

15 deems pertinent with respect to site-specific environmental and bovine facility siting issues." Thus,

16 without any adequate guidelines or standards, the ACFP leaves it up to the sole discretion of the

17 Resource Management Agency staff the decision what studies would be required to any given facility.
18 This approach improperly defers the analysis of potentially significant impacts and mitigation
19
measures to the discretionary determination by staff at a later date without adequate future CEQA 20

21 review. The CEQA Initial Study Checklist, in contrast, requires the lead agency to consider all

22 potentially significant impacts after adequate considerations and further requires notice and disclosure

23 of those significant impacts to the public.

24 37. The ACFP and the EIR also permit streamline review even for a dairy expansion that
25 does not conform with the separation and setback requirements of the ACFP, as long as the expanded
26 operation would "not encroach any closer than existing facilities." Bovine Facility Checklist, item
27

28 2(b). Thus, an expansion application under the ACFP would evade environmental review regardless

11

PETITION FOR PEREMPTOR Y WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

of the size of the existing facility, the proposed expansion or the type of environmental impacts that

2 could result (such as water quality or biological impacts). Contrary to Policy 2.5-3, the County could
not lawfully approve a non-conforming dairy expansion without site-specific environmental review
because the County could not make the findings required by CEQA Guideline §15168(c)(2) ("If the
5

6 agency finds that pursuant to Section 15162, no new effects could occur or no new mitigation

•[ measures would be required, the agency can approve the activity as being within the scope of the

8 project covered by the program EIR, and no new environmental document would be required.")

9 38. According to the FEIR, "to qualify for a streamlined analysis (ACFP §2.5-3), a
10 proposed expansion must incorporate, to the extent possible, the Category A emission reduction
11 strategies listed in Table 5, on page 34-35, ...." FEIR at 2-18. Thus, under the ACFP, a proposed
12

13 expansion that does not incorporate all applicable Category A emission reduction strategies may still

14 be approved without CEQA review pursuant to the streamlined permitting process. The FEIR claims

15 that "the scope and number of emissions reduction strategies needed to meet the requirements for the

16 streamlined process under ACFP $2.5-4", however §2.5-4 does not contain any such guidelines.

17 Accordingly, because it is entirely at the discretion of the County to decide, on an ad hoc basis,
18 whether any given expansion application qualifies for the streamlined process, the FEIR and ACFP
19
cannot lawfully exempt expansion projects from individualized CEQA review. In other words, the
20

21 County could not make the findings required by CEQA Guideline §15168(c)(2).

22 39. The County's mitigation scheme violates CEQA because it amounts to unlawful

23 deferral of mitigation measures. The County has essentially pre-approved an undeterminable number

24 of expansion projects without setting a minimum performance standard, in violation of CEQA.
25 40. The FEIR violates CEQA also because through its streamlined CEQA checklist
26 approach, it exempts from any CEQA review new expansion projects that generate less than 25,000
27

28 metric tons of GHG emissions and meet certain siting requirements. These projects, however, may

12

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

still be capable of causing significant environmental impacts on, for example, biological resources, air

2 and water quality, aesthetic resources, etc. In other words, because the Final EIR never considered

site-specific impacts, it could not be relied on by the County to exempt any new or expanded projects
4 from site-specific review. Moreover, there is no substantial evidence to show project's with less than 5

6 25,000 metric tons of GHG emissions would not cause a cumulatively significant impact on climate

7 change.

8 41. The County's failure to identify an appropriate environmental baseline undermines the

9 EIR's analysis of the Project's direct and cumulative environmental impacts, particularly impacts
10 related to climate change. Owing to the uncertainty surrounding the extent to which new and
11 expanding dairy projects under the plans would be required to mitigate potentially significant impacts,
12

13 and the County's failure to adopt thresholds of significance, the EIR's analysis of the ACFP's

14 environmental impacts is unreliable and not supported by substantial evidence.

15 42. The EIR violates CEQA because the County's proposed check-list approach is intended

16 and would exempt future new and expanded dairies from CEQA review even where the evidence

17 shows the site-specific project approved under the plan is capable of causing significant impacts. For
18 example, where category A mitigation measures are deemed infeasible, a new project could be
19

20 approved subject to a streamlined approach by arbitrarily implementing a Category B mitigation, even

21 where the evidence shows the project would cause significant impacts.

22 43. The EIR is inadequate as an informational document because it fails to discuss the

23 extent to which compliance with the Air Pollution District and the Regional Water Quality Control

24 District permitting requirements would reduce impacts from new and expanding projects under the
25 plan to a less than significant level. As the lead agency, the County was required to require additional
26 mitigation measures to address impacts on air quality and water quality if the evidence shows the
27

28 regulatory permitting process does not adequately, address dairy and feedlot impacts on these

13

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

resources.

2 44. The EIR fails to adequately consider potentially feasible mitigation measures to reduce
GHG emissions or demonstrates that mitigation measures suggested by the public infeasible.
4

5 Appendix B, Table 3 shows the three largest sources of GHG emissions are manure decomposition,

6 enteric digestion, and emissions from farm agricultural soils. The proposed GHG reduction strategies

7 considered in Table 4 demonstrates that the EIR only considered feed additives and Total Mixed

8 Ration (TMR) feeding strategies along with the use of digesters as viable GHG reduction strategies.

9 None of the measures, however, resulted in any substantial reductions of the projected increases in
10 projected GHG emissions.
11
45. The County's analysis and selection of alternatives to the Project violates CEQA. The 12

13 County considered it legally infeasible to eliminate unlawful animal confinement facilities that

14 continue to operate without valid permits and authorization from the County, the Air Pollution Control

15 District or the Regional Water Quality Control Board. The County's contention that enforcing its own

16 permitting authority by eliminating unpermitted dairies and feedlots would amount to a "regulatory
17 taking" is clearly without basis and not supported by the applicable laws.
18 46. The County's approach of rewarding unlawful and unpermitted dairies and feedlots by
19
offering the same streamlined approach for expansion as available to lawfully operated operations is 20

21 bad public policy and manifestly unfair to those bovine operations who have consistently operated

22 within a legal framework. Existing unpermitted dairies, moreover, are exempted from implementing

23 the mitigation measures that would ostensibly be required of all future new and expanded dairies.

24 This approach again perversely rewards unlawful and unpermitted operators by exempting them from
25 the mitigation requirement applicable to new operations. There is no evidence in the record or
26 persuasive argument supporting the County's conclusion that requiring grandfathered dairies to
27

28 implement the same mitigation as new dairies would be infeasible or contrary to sound public policy.

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATOR Y AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 47. The County's rejection of a "1% growth" alternative is not adequately explained and is

2 not supported by substantial evidence. The County claims this environmentally superior alternative is
infeasible because it fails to fully promote the County's objectives of promoting economic

5 development and continued productivity of economic resources. There is no evidence or argument to

6 support the County's arbitrary conclusion that 1.5% growth would fully support the County's

7 undefined and amorphous economic objectives, but % heard growth would not.

8 48. The EIR's analysis of growth rate is internally inconsistent and incoherent. In response

9 to Sierra Club's comment, the County claimed "the 1.5% annual growth rate was a reasonable
10 assumption used for the EIR's impact analysis, ...." Response to FEIR comments, at page 2. The
11 County CEQA Findings' discussion of alternatives, however, demonstrates that the EIR considered
12

13 the 1.5% growth rate to be a growth cap by explaining that "the Thirty-three percent reduced Herd

14 Size Alternative would reduce adverse impacts Findings at p. 574. If the 1.5% growth rate is

15 merely a reasonable growth rate and not a cap, how could the EIR reasonably consider a 1% growth

16 rate as a reasonable alternative to 1.5% growth rate?

17 49. The EIR's discussion of potentially feasible mitigation measures is inadequate.
18 WHEREFORE, PETITIONERS pray for judgment against the City, as set forth herein below.
19

20 1. For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent

21 injunctions restraining Respondents and their agents, servants, and employees, and all others acting in

22 concert with them or on their behalf, from taking any action to implement or fund any portion or

23 aspect of the Project, pending full compliance with the requirements of CEQA, and the CEQA

24 Guidelines;

25 2. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to vacate and

26 set aside certification of the EIR and all approval documents for the Project;

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 3. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to comply with

2 CEQA, and the CEQA Guidelines, and take any other action as required by Public Resources Code

3 section 21168.9;

4 4. For a declaration that Respondents' actions in certifying the EIR and approving the

5 Project violated CEQA, and the CEQA Guidelines, and that the certification and all project approvals
6 are invalid and of no force or effect;

7 5. For cost of the suit;

8 6. For reasonable attorney's fees as authorized by Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5

9 and other provisions of law; and,
10 7. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

RE: Notice of Intent to Commence Litigation Tulare County for violation of California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Res. Code §21,000) in connection with the County's approval of an Animal Confinement Facilities Plan

Honorable Supervisors
1540 Marsh Street
Suite 110 Please take notice that the Sierra Club, Center for Biological Diversity, and Association of
San Luis Obispo Irritated Residents (collectively "Petitioners") intend to commence legal action against the California 93401 County of Tulare and the Tulare County Board of Supervisors (collectively "County") in
ph: 805-593-0926 connection with the County's approval of an Animal Confinement Facilities Plan (ACFP),

fax:805-593-0946 which also included certification of an Environmental Impact Report and approval of General Plan and zoning amendments.
babaknoficy@sbcgiobal.net Petitioners contend the County violated the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Pub. Res. Code §21000 et seq., by preparing and certifying a Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR), which among other things, fails to adequately describe the Project's environmental baseline or to analyze the project's potential environmental impacts. Petitioners further contend the County's approval of the Project violated CEQA because the County improperly defers the formulation of mitigation measures and authorizes future expansion of dairies and feedlots without adequate environmental review or mitigation. Petitioners intend to seek a judicial declaration that the County's approval of the Project was an abuse of discretion as it violated CEQA, its findings in support of the Project were not supported by substantial evidence and it failed to proceed in the manner required by law. Petitioner will seek an order setting aside the County's EIR and its unlawful approval of the Project. Babak Naficy udaneldpeng Attorney for Petitioners
