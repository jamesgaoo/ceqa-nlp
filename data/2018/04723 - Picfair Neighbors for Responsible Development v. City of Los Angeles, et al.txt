PROJECT BACKGROUND, ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND APPROVAL

2 On July 18, 2018 the Director of City Planning approved the Project and found
3 that the Project qualified for a categorical exemption from CEQA. Specifically, the Director 11.

approved a Transit Oriented Communities Affordable Housing Incentive Program Request
5 utilizing the following two (2) incentives. (A) Height. A 22-foot addition to permit a building 4

6 height of 53 feet and two (2) inches in lieu of a maximum height of 33 feet as required by

7 Ordinance No. 179,884; and (B) Open Space. A 25 percent reduction in required open space;

8 12. On or about July 31, 2018, members of Petitioner appealed the approval and
9 environmental determination as provided for by the Los Angeles Municipal Code.
10 13. On October 25, 2018 the City Planning Commission held a hearing on the appeal.
11 The City Planning Commission denied the appeal and reaffirmed that the Project was exempt 8 d11 'dnoJg Channel Law •+Z06 euns "pAa :IJuSIIM O0Z8 12 from CEQA.
13 14. On or about October 30, 2018, a Notice of Exemption ("NOE") was filed with the 8
'SIlIH Áueneg 14 County Recorder for the Project. On or about November 26, 2018, Petitioner filed an appeal of
15 the CEQA determination to the Los Angeles City Council pursuant to Public Resources Code
16 Section 21151(c). Petitioner's CEQA appeal remains pending.
17 CEOA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS

18 15. In 1970, the California Legislature enacted CEQA, as a means of forcing public

20 implications of its actions. CEQA's fundamental goal is to fully inform the public and the 19 agency decision makers, such as Respondent, to document and consider the environmental

22 members of the public that their elected officials are making informed decisions. CEQA requires 21 decision makers as to the environmental consequences of proposed projects and to assure

23 governmental authorities, such as Respondent, to fully evaluate potential environmental effects
of projects, and to seek feasible means to reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that
25 otherwise could result from their actions, CEQA limits agencies from approving projects with 24

26 significant adverse impacts when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen such impacts.
27

4 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

16. The primary function of an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") is to discuss the
2 important environmental consequences of the project, including cumulative effects, and to
3 provide the agency and the general public with mitigation measures and alternatives to the
project that would have Jess serious environmental consequences. Under CEQA lead agencies,
5 such as Respondent, are required to prepare a complete and legally adequate EIR prior to
6 approving any discretionary project that may have a significant adverse a effect on the
7 environment. The EIR must fully disclose and adequately analyze the project's potentially
8 significant environmental effects. CEQA also requires lead agencies, such as Respondent, to
consider mitigation measures and alternatives to a project, adopt all feasible mitigation measures
10 and/or alternatives, determine whether proposed mitigation measures will be effective in
11 avoiding or substantially lessening the project's significant environmental impacts, and to make § d11 'dnoJg MET |ouueyo L LZ06 12 3 NS "PALE EJJUSIM 00Z8 adequate findings, including an adequate statement of overriding consideration for those
13 8 significant environmental impacts deemed unavoidable.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION SW!H Kuexeg 14

15 (VIOLATION OF CEQA: Improper Adoption of Exemption)
16 17. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
17 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
18 18. The City improperly concluded that the Project qualified for a categorical
19 exemption under CEQA.
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION 20

21 (VIOLATION OF LOCAL ZONING LAW)
22 19. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
23 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
24 20. The Project is not within 1500 of a major transit stop and therefore does not
25 qualify as a Tier 3 eligible project. The City improperly concluded otherwise.
26 21. Further, the City improperly concluded that the Project was not subject to
27

5 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 applicable Q conditions which limited heights in the area because the Project was a "Tránsit

2 Oriented Development."

3 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

(DECLARATORY RELIEF)

22. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in

6 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

23. Petitioner seeks a judicial declaration that Respondents' determination that the
8 Project was eligible for a categorical exemption from CEQA failed to comply with the
9 requirements of CEQA. Petitioner also seeks a determination that the Project is not eligible for a
10 Tier 3 TOD Project and that the City's Q conditions are not overwritten.
11 24. Respondents have a mandatory duty to comply with CEQA and other legal 00e 9 •LZ06 LL0S MPNE TEHLSIMA DOZ 8 'SIIIH Áueneg 12 requirements applicable to the Project. Channel Law dnoJo 13 25. Petitioner has the right to enforce these mandatory duties.
14 26. Petitioner has no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy at law, and will suffer
15 irreparable injury unless it receives the relief requested in this Petition.
16 27. An actual controversy exists between Petitioner and Respondents as to whether
17 the actions and conduct of Respondents alleged in this Petition have violated CEQA and other
18 laws as identified herein. This controversy implicates the legality of the manner in which
19 Respondents have proceeded in giving the Project Approvals, the validity of the Respondents'
20 actions with respect thereto and, consequently, the legal ability of Respondents to take further
21 actions to develop the Project based upon the Project Approvals. The Petitioner contends that
22 each and all such actions and conduct have violated and will violate these laws. Petitioner is
23 informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that Respondents dispute these contentions. A
24 judicial resolution of that controversy is now required pursuant to California Code of Civil
25 Procedure section 1060.

26 28. Petitioner requests a judicial declaration that Respondents' actions and conduct
27

6 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 alleged in this Petition have violated and will violate CEQA and other laws identified herein.

2 Such declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time under the circumstances in order that
3 Petitioner and Respondents may ascertain their rights and duties.

29. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.
No money damages or other legal remedy could adequately compensate Petitioner for the harms

6 described in the preceding paragraphs.

served the City with notice of Petitioner's intention to immediately commence a proceeding
10 against Respondents for violation of CEQA in connection with the Project. A copy of the letter
