23 Petitioner alleges through this Petition as follows:

24 INTRODUCTION

1.

25 In this action Petitioner Hammond Landowners Association, ("Petitioner" or

26 "HLA") challenges the approval by Respondents, City of Weed and the City of Weed City

27 Council (collectively "Respondent") of a Conditional Use Permit and the related certification of

28 Final Environmental Impact Report (the "FEIR") (together, the "Project Approvals") for the
Love's Travel Stop project (the "Project"). As set forth below, implementation of the Project

- pursuant to the Project Approvals will have numerous and substantial impacts on the
2 environment, which were not properly analyzed and mitigated to less than significant levels.
OUA0 Moreover, Respondents' Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations are not
supported by substantial evidence.

2. Petitioner requests that this Court vacate, set aside, rescind and void all of the
Project Approvals, actions, resolutions, and findings related to the Project, as well as the FEIR
certified by Respondent, including rescinding any authorizations to proceed with construction.

8 The Project was first improperly recommended for approval by the City of Weed Planning

9 Commission on August 15, 2018, was subsequently improperly "approved" by the Planning

10 Commission on October 3, 2018, and approved by the Respondent City Council on October 25,

1I 2018. Petitioner requests that the Court vacate the Project Approvals because Respondent failed
to comply with the provisions set forth under the California Environmental Quality Act, Public 12 Resources Code ("CEQA") section 21000, et seq., the Planning and Zoning Law, Government 13 Code section 65000, et seq., the Weed Municipal Code, and because Respondents failed to 14 proceed in a manner required by law.
15 3. Petitioner seeks a Peremptory Writ of Mandate under California Code of Civil
16 Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, directing Respondent to vacate, rescind and set aside all
17 Project Approvals, including the certification of the FEIR.
18 PARTIES
19 4. Petitioner HLA is, and at all times mentioned herein was, a California not-for-
20 profit unincorporated association. Petitioner's members include residents, voters, property
21 owners and taxpayers in and around the City of Weed. Petitioner's members are vitally and
22 beneficially interested in the land use decisions made by Respondents. Petitioner has an interest
23 in protecting the region's air quality, minimizing and ameliorating traffic congestion, noise and

24 land use conflicts, ensuring informed and responsible growth, and promoting other

25 environment-related quality-of-life issues. Unmitigated environmental effects associated with

26 the Project will adversely affect Petitioner as well as citizens of Weed and the surrounding

27 region.

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 2

P 5. Respondent City of Weed is a political subdivision of the State of California and a

2
mtu body corporate and politic exercising local government power. City of Weed is the CEQA "lead !
agency" for the Project. As lead agency for the Project, City of Weed is responsible for
preparation of an environmental document that describes the Project and its impacts, and, if
necessary evaluates mitigation measures and/or alternatives to lessen or avoid any significant

~ environmental impacts. The City of Weed also has principal responsibility for determining
whether projects within its jurisdiction are consistent with applicable land use ordinances and

8 other applicable laws.

9 6. Respondent City Council of the City of Weed is a legislative body duly

10 authorized under the California Constitution and the laws of the State of California to act on

I1 behalf of the County of Siskiyou. Respondent City Council of the City of Weed is responsible

12 for regulating and controlling land use within the County including, but not limited to,

13 implementing and complying with the provisions of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, 14

14 California Code of Regulations, title 14, section 15000 et seq. (the "Guidelines"), applicable

15 land use ordinances and other laws. As the elected representatives of the people of the City,

16 the City Council establishes overall City priorities and sets policy. The City Council is the

17 governing body of the City and is ultimately responsible for reviewing and approving or

18 denying the Project.

19 7. Real Party in Interest Love's Travel Stop (*Real Party") is the proponent and

20 developer of the Project. Petitioner is informed and believes that Love's Travel Stop is a

21 corporation organized and operating under the laws of the State of Oklahoma, and/or is

22 authorized to, and does conduct business in California.

8.
23 Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Respondent sued herein

24 as DOES 1 through 20, inclusive, and Real Parties in Interest sued herein as DOES 21 through

25 40, inclusive and, therefore, sues the Respondent and Real Parties in Interest by such fictitious

26 names. Petitioner will seek leave to amend the Petition/Complaint, if necessary, to allege the
true names and capacities when ascertained.
27 9.

28 Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that at all times material
hereto, each DOE Respondent named in this Petition/Complaint was the agent and employee of

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 3

2 each of the other Respondent herein, and was at all times material thereto, acting within the

NOU Aw course and scope of the agencies and the employment and with the permission and consent of
Respondent.

JURISDICTION, VENUE AND EXHAUSTION OF
ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES
10. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 1085, 1094.5, and
187 of the California Code

8 Public Resources Code. of Civil Procedure, and Sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the California

9 11. Venue is proper in Siskiyou County under Section 394 of the California Code of

10 Civil Procedure as Respondent in which the real property in dispute is located lies within
Siskiyou County.
12.
12 Petitioner has complied with the requirements of California Public Resources Code

13 section 21167.5 by sending a Notice of Commencement (*Notice") of this action to Respondent

14 prior to filing this Petition/Complaint. A true and correct copy of the Notice is attached hereto

15 as Exhibit "A" and incorporated herein by this reference.
13.
16 Respondents' conduct in approving the Project constitutes a prejudicial abuse of

17 discretion because, as alleged in this Petition, Respondent failed to proceed in the manner

18 required by law, failed to certify an adequate Environmental Impact Report (*EIR"), failed to

19 make mandatory findings, and made other findings not supported by substantial evidence, and

20 failed to adopt feasible mitigation measures. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, adequate remedy

21 at law and, along with members of the public, will suffer irreparable harm as a result of
Respondent' violations of CEQA and other laws as set forth herein.

22 14.

23 Petitioner has satisfied each and every exhaustion-of-remedies requirement that
must be satisfied in order to maintain this proceeding. In particular:

24 A. The violations of law challenged in this proceeding were identified for

25 Respondents orally and in writing by Petitioner, as well as public agencies and private citizens

26 prior to the close of the public hearing on the Project, as required by California Public

27 Resources Code section 21 177 subdivision (a).

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 4

B.

0yap0 t0 Petitioner objected to the Project's approval prior to the close of the
Planning Commission and City Councils' public hearings on the Project, as required by Public
Resources Code section 2l177 subdivision (b).

C. Any and all available appeals of the Project Approvals were pursued, and
Respondent's Project Approvals are now final. Accordingly, Petitioner's claims are ripe for

review.

15. Petitioner has elected to prepare the record of proceedings in the above-captioned
proceeding pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6 subdivision (b)(2).

9 16. This petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section

10 21167 and CEQA Guidelines section 15112.

II STANDING

17.
12 a Petitioner has standing as a party beneficially interested in the issuance of the

13 requested writ of mandate because the Project, as alleged more specifically herein, will have

14 significant adverse environmental impacts on the individuals named herein as well as the

15 general public. Petitioner has a beneficial interest in Respondent's fulfillment of all their legal

L6 duties, as alleged in this pleading, because the unmitigated environmental effects of the Project

L7 will result in, inter alia, traffic congestion, aesthetic impacts, land use conflicts and unhealthy

18 air, which will adversely affect Petitioner's property, business and customers, and the health of

19 Petitioner and the traveling public. Moreover, as residents, taxpayers and property owners

20 within the City of Weed, Petitioner is adversely affected by land use decisions of the City

21 Council challenged herein, each of which contravene the Weed General Plan, the Weed
Municipal Code and the planning and zoning laws of the State of California.

22 CEQA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS

23 18.

24 In 1970, the California Legislature enacted CEQA, as a means of forcing public
agency decision makers such as Respondents to document and consider the environmental

25 implications of their actions. CEQA's fundamental goal is to fully inform the public and the

26 decision makers as to the environmental consequences of proposed projects and to assure

27 members of the public that their elected officials are making informed decisions. CEQA

28 requires governmental authorities, such as Respondent, to fully evaluate potential environmental

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 5

2

W effects of projects, and to seek feasible means to reduce or avoid significant environmental

0p damage that otherwise could result from their actions. CEQA limits agencies from approving
projects with significant adverse impacts when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen
such impacts.

19. Under CEQA, Respondents are required to prepare a complete and legally

0 adequate EIR prior to approving any discretionary project that may have a significant adverse

9 effect on the environment. The EIR must fully disclose and adequately analyze the project's

10 potentially significant environmental effects. Respondent is required, pursuant to CEQA, to
consider mitigation measures and alternatives to the project, adopt all feasible mitigation

1L1

12 measures and/or alternatives, determine whether proposed mitigation measures will be effective
in avoiding or substantially lessening the project's significant environmental impacts, and to

13 make adequate findings, including an adequate statement of overriding consideration for those

14 significant environmental impacts deemed significant and unavoidable. Respondent may not

15 avoid the duty to prepare an EIR by segmenting a project into several smaller projects.
20.

16 When a government agency takes action to adopt a Negative Declaration
EIR, it must exercise its independent judgment and analysis. or an

17 21.
18 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

19 The real property comprising the Project site consists of vacant land totaling

20 approximately 15 acres (the "Site") located generally on the south west corner of South

21 Weed/Vista Drive exit to Interstate 5 of Interstate 5 and in the City of Weed. The Site also

22 includes a parcel of land owned by the City of Weed which Respondents apparently intended, or
perhaps continue to intend, to convey in some fashion to Love's for the

23 purpose of installing a

24 massive 150-foot tall sign advertising the Project. Prior to Real Party's application for the

25 Project Approvals, the City Council had approved a much smaller and less intense gas station
and mini market on the Site, but that project was never constructed.
22.

26

27 [n early 2018, City staff received an application from Real Party to develop all of

28 the subject property as a truck plaza. The Project Approvals sought by Real Party include a
Conditional Use Permit and a Variance to allow for a massive 150-foot illuminated sign for the
truck plaza.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 6

23.

ü A W N Respondents processed the applications for the Project Approvals, and prepared an
Initial Study which concluded that the Project would likely result in significant effects on the
environment. Accordingly, a Draft Environmental Impact Report ("DEIR") was prepared.
24. Petitioner and other members of the public submitted numerous comment letters

~ outlining the inadequacies of the DEIR. Respondents prepared responses to comments and

25.

00 made additional substantive revisions to the DEIR, all contained within the proposed FEIR.

9 On or about August 15, 2018, the City of Weed Planning Commission conducted a

10 public hearing on the Project Approvals. In the weeks and months prior to the public hearing,

11 Petitioner and other members of the public submitted voluminous letters, protests and testimony
in opposition to the proposed Project, and outlining numerous procedural errors and

12 shortcomings by Respondent in connection with the Project Approvals. Substantial evidence

13 was submitted to Respondent that the project would, in fact, result in significant environmental

[4 effects, including but not limited to land-use conflicts, noise, traffic, air quality, wildfire dangers

15 and aesthetic impacts. Petitioner also objected to the participation of a newly appointed

[6 Planning Commissioner whose ownership of a local towing service precluded his involvement
in the Commission's deliberation and decisions with

17 respect to the process. Notwithstanding

18 this evidence, the newly appointed Commissioner did participate and cast the deciding vote as

City Council.

19 the Planning Commission, on a narrow 3-2 vote, recommended approval of the Project to the

26.

20

21 Petitioner and other members of the public pointed out to the Commission and to

22 Respondents that the Planning Commission was not a "recommending" body under the Weed

23 Municipal Code, but in fact, had approval authority over the Project Approvals and with respect
to the certification of the FEIR.

27..

24

25 Petitioner and others submitted timely appeals of the Planning Commission's

26 decision. City staff subsequently and unilaterally "vacated" the Planning Commission's

27 decision, and noticed another public hearing without conducting any hearing on the pending

28 appeals. The Commission conducted another public hearing at which the Project Approvals and
the certification of the FEIR were approved over Petitioner's objections. Petitioner and others
submitted timely appeals to the City Council.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 7

28. The City Council scheduled and conducted an appeal hearing on October 25, 2018.
NOüA0 N As before, Petitioner and others submitted voluminous written testimony and evidence in
opposition to the Project. Petitioner also submitted evidence and testimony as to procedural

errors and inconsistencies, each of which precluded meaningful participation in the process.
These included inaccurate and misleading agenda and public hearing notices, inaccurate
information as to the role and function of the Planning Commission and City Council, failure to
timely provide staff reports, the FEIR, findings and other public documents, failure to disclose
vital information concerning the project description and related environmental effects. The City

9 Council denied the appeals and upheld the Commission's decision unanimously.
29.
10 City staff prepared and posted a Notice of Determination on October 26, 2018.
This action was = 9 m timely filed within the 30-day statute of limitations set forth in Public
Resources Code Section 21167.

PUBLIC BENEFIT

14 30. This action involves enforcement of an important right affecting the public
interest. By ensuring that Project impacts are properly evaluated and mitigated, and General 15 Plan and zoning consistency is maintained, Petitioner will confer a substantial benefit to the
16 citizens of the City of Weed, the County of Siskiyou, the region, and the State of California
17 generally, and therefore will be entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to
18 Section 1021.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

19 IRREPARABLE HARM

20 31. Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA, the California Planning and Zoning
21 laws and the Weed Municipal Code as set forth in this petition, constitute a prejudicial abuse of
22 discretion within the meaning of the Code of Civil Procedure and CEQA. (See Code of Civ.

23 Proc., §§ 1085, 1094.5; Pub. Resources Code, §g 21168, 21168.5.)

24 32. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. If

25 Real Party begins construction pursuant to the Project Approvals, Petitioner will be irreparably

26 harmed because the unexamined and unmitigated environmental impacts would occur before

27 Respondent is required to study them.

J0u PW CAUSES OF ACTION

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

33. (Prejudicial Abuse of Discretion: Failure to comply with CEQA)
Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations set forth in
Paragraphs I through 32, above.
34.

0 CEQA Guideline section 15126.2(a) and Bakersfield Citizens for Local Control v.
City of Bakersfield (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1184, require that an EIR correlate or quantify a

9 project's significant air pollution to increase health effects.

35.

10 quality effects.

11 36. The EIR fails to provide such correlation despite significant and unavoidable air

12 Memoranda submitted by Petitioner and consultants retained by an existing truck

13 plaza within the City demonstrated that the traffic analysis in the DEIR was deficient,

14 understating project trip generation, failing to identify significant reductions in the level of

37.
15 service at key intersections and roadway segments and failing to provide adequate mitigation.

16 inadequate.

38. The FEIR's analysis of public services and utilities to serve the Project is

17 39.
18 The FEIR's analysis of General Plan consistency is inadequate.

19 simulations. The FEIR's analysis of aesthetic and visual impacts is incomplete and inadequate,

20 failing to accurately depict the project and omitting important information, including visual

40.

21

22 The FEIR's alternatives analysis is impermissibly narrow in focus and inadequate.

23 Moreover, the FEIR inaccurately overstated the environmental impacts of Alternative 3 to the

24 Project so as to preclude meaningful consideration of an alternative that would have reduced the
environmental effects of the Project while still meeting the objectives of the Project.
41.

25 The Project Description in the FEIR is inadequate, and relies upon "project

26 objectives" which impermissibly restrict the scope of subsequent analyses of mitigation

27

28 measures and alternatives. Moreover, the Project Description fails to disclose any information
as to the apparent inclusion of City-owned property within the Project for a 150 foot illuminated
sign.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 9

42. The FEIR includes vital new information that was never included in the DEIR,
AW N which legally requires recirculation. For example, the DEIR did not include details about the
proposed 90-foot sign which was discussed in the FEIR. A 90-foot sign will have significant
aesthetic impacts on the views in the area. The FEIR includes information concerning
underground stormwater pipe and discharge to a ditch that was not previously included. The
O public should have had the opportunity to fully consider and comment on those changes prior to

7 the adoption of the FEIR.

43. 8 The responses to public comments are dismissive, conclusory and inadequate, and

9 fail to provide a good faith, reasoned response as required by CEQA Guidelines section 15088.
44. 10 In light of significant new information, new mitigation measures and changes to
the Project as evaluated in the DEIR, Respondent was required to recirculate the DEIR pursuant
se to CEQA Guidelines section 15088.5. Respondents unlawfully failed and refused to recirculate
the DEIR.

45. CEQA Guidelines sections 15091 and 15093 required Respondents to adopt 14 specific findings prior to approving the Project.
15 46. Petitioner, its consultant, and members of the public identified feasible, practical
16 and attainable mitigation measures which could reduce the identified impacts to less than
17 significant levels. These feasible mitigation measures were summarily and impermissibly
18 rejected without evidentiary support, in violation of CEQA. Respondents violated CEQA by
19 refusing to meaningfully consider feasible mitigation measures identified by Petitioner and
20 members of the public which could ensure that the significant traffic and other impacts which
21 will result from the Project will be reduced to a less than significant level.

22 47. The Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations prepared and adopted by

23 Respondent including those contained in the resolutions, staff reports and other documents in

24 support of the Project Approvals are not supported by substantial evidence in the administrative

25 record and do not bridge the analytical gap between the evidence and the decision.

26 48. Consequently, Respondents' decision to approve the Project is not supported by

27 substantial evidence and Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law and

28 prejudicially abused its discretion in approving the Project.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 10

NOUAWN- SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

49. (Failure to Proceed in the Manner Required by Law)
Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations set forth in
Paragraphs 1 through 48, above.

50. During the public review and public hearing process, Petitioner submitted evidence
and testimony as to numerous procedural errors and inconsistencies, each of which precluded
meaningful participation in the process. These included inaccurate and misleading agenda and
public hearing notices, inaccurate information as to the role and function of the Planning

9 Commission and City Council, failure to timely provide staff reports, the Final EIR, findings

10 and other public documents, and failure to disclose vital information concerning the project

1I description and related environmental effects.

51.
12 Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by failing to proceed in the

13 manner required by law. As such, the court should issue a writ of mandate commanding

14 Respondent to set aside the certification of the FEIR and approval of the Project Approvals.

15 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

16 52. (Project Approvals Inconsistent with General Plan and Municipal Code)

17 Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations set forth in
Paragraphs 1 through 51, above.
18 53.

19 The California Planning and Zoning law mandates that all development projects,

20 such as the Project proposed by Real Party, must be consistent with Respondent City of Weed's

21 General Plan. (Government Code sections 65300, et seq. DeVita v. County of Napa (1995) 9

22 Cal.4th 763, 772) The Project, as approved, is inconsistent with numerous mandatory goals and
policies of the Weed General Plan, which were outlined in correspondence from Petitioner and

23 other members of the public, and subsequently elaborated upon in oral and written testimony.

24 These included, inter alia, inconsistency with mandatory aesthetic protection policies and

25 policies protecting residents from land use conflicts. Respondents ignored this evidence, and

26 failed to make adequate findings as to how the Project was consistent with the City of Weed's

27 General Plan and the requirements of the Weed Municipal Code.

28 54. Accordingly Respondents were unable to make the findings required under the

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE L1

U A w Municipal Code and/or such findings are not supported by substantial evidence in the record
and the Project Approvals are void and must be set aside.
55. Respondents violated the Weed Municipal Code and failed to proceed in a manner
required by law in approving the Project and therefore prejudicially abused its discretion.
FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

~ 56. (Denial of Due Process/Brown Act Violation)

0O Paragraphs 1 through 55, above.

9 57. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations set forth in

10

II Government Code section 54957.5(a) requires that agendas, materials and staff
reports provided to public officials also be made available to the public "without delay".

12 Section 54957.5(b) further requires all such materials which are distributed to the legislative

13 body less than 72 hours before the meeting be simultaneously made available to the public.
58.

14 In the case of both the Planning Commission and the City Council hearings on the

15 Project, critical documents and staff reports were not made available to Petitioner and members

16 of the public in a timely fashion, and in many cases, not at all. In some instances, Petitioner

17 was forced to request documents via the California Public Records Act. These requests were

18 summarily denied and/or delayed. Moreover, when Respondents adopted motions to approve

19 the Project Approvals, no specific, separate action with respect to the FEIR was taken prior to

20 the approval of the Project Approvals, and no City Councilmember made any reference to the

21 boilerplate findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations prepared by its legal counsel.
59.

22 The City's refusal to provide access to vital documents pertaining to the Project

23 constitutes a denial of Petitioner's right to due process of law, a violation of the Ralph M.

24 Brown Act, Government Code section 54950 et seq., and further constitutes a failure to proceed

25 in a manner required by law. Petitioner and members of the public are entitled to comment on

26 all agenda items, and to submit comments on environmental issues pertaining to the agency's
compliance with CEQA, but were denied such rights.
60.

27

28 The City Council failed to take specific action to adopt adequate CEQA findings
and the Statement of Overriding Considerations prepared by its legal counsel before taking
action with respect to the Project Approvals. It is unclear whether the CEQA findings were

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 12

Dear Mr. Stock:

Please take notice, under Public Resources Code section 21167.5, that Hammond Landowners Association intends to file a Petition for Writ of Mandate in Siskiyou County Superior Court under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code, section 21000 et seq. against the City of Weed and the City Council of the City of Weed. The Petition for Writ of Mandate will challenge the October 25, 2018, certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report for the Love's Travel Stop Project and approval of the Love's Travel Stop Project. The Petition for Writ of Mandate will request that the court direct the City and City Council to vacate and rescind all Project approvals and direct the City to comply with CEQA.

Very truly yours,
