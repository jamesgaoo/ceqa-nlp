VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

Petitioner HERITAGE FIELDS EL TORO, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company

2 (hereafter "Heritage Fields"), brings this action on its own behalf, on behalf of the general public, and

3 in the public interest, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and Public Resources Code

4 section 21168 or, in the alternative, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 and Public

5 Resources Code section 21168.5. Heritage Fields alleges as follows:

6 INTRODUCTION

7 1. Once again, the County of Orange (the "County") has taken actions that threaten the

8 successful completion of the master-planned Orange County Great Park (the "Great Park"), and are in

9 clear violation of the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Res. Code Sections 21000 et seq.
10 ("CEQA").

11 2. On June 5, 2018, the Orange County Board of Supervisors approved the West Alton
12 Parcel Development Plan ("West Alton Plan" or "Project"), certified Environmental Impact Report
13 No. 621 (the "EIR") for the West Alton Plan, adopted related findings, a Statement of Overriding
14 Considerations, and a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program, and authorized County staff to
15 take necessary actions toward implementation of the West Alton Plan.

16 3. As Heritage Fields and others raised throughout the public comment period prior to its
17 certification, the EIR is incomplete, misleading, and inaccurate, and fails to fully and accurately
18 describe applicable regulations and standards and the West Alton Plan's consistency with those
19 regulations.

20 4. The West Alton Plan purports to be a development plan for the West Alton Parcel, a

21 site consisting of approximately 44.16 acres of land in the City of Irvine ("City"). This property is
22 located on the former Marine Corps Air Station El Toro Property ("MCAS El Toro Property"), a
23 4,700-acre former Marine base. The West Alton Plan contains development standards and design
24 guidelines, and "Conceptual Site Plan." The West Alton Plan authorizes 803 multi-family
25 residential units and ancillary private uses across two development areas: the 21.98-acre northern
26 piece, and the 10.34-acre southern piece. These development areas are separated by a protected
27 11.84-acre Wildlife Movement Corridor.

Gibson, Dunn &

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

5. This lawsuit is a companion suit to Heritage Fields' existing Petition challenging the
2 El Toro 100-Acre Development Plan ("100-Acre Plan"), its inadequate Environmental Impact Report
3 No. 620, and the County's Development Agreement and Master Ground Lease with Lowe Enterprises
4 Real Estate Group ("Lowe") covering the 100-Acre Property. Like the West Alton Parcel, the 100-

5 Acre Property is land predominantly owned by the County in the City of Irvine on the MCAS El Toro

6 Property. The County has approved developing both parcels for extensive private uses, with Lowe as

7 the explicitly designated "Developer."

8 6. After its closure, Heritage Fields purchased the vast majority of the MCAS EI Toro

9 Property from the United States Department of the Navy as part of the "Great Park" transaction,
10 which is transforming the former base into commercial and residential development and more than a
11 thousand acres of public park, with Heritage Fields as the landowner and master developer of the
12 residential development as well as most of the planned commercial development. As part of this
13 transaction, Heritage Fields conveyed approximately 1,100 acres of the MCAS El Toro Property to
14 the City and, in turn, the City conveyed (or is in the process of conveying)- at no cost- certain land
15 to the County, including the West Alton Parcel and 100-Acre Property. The property set aside for the
16 County was intended to be utilized for County-related uses, as a public benefit, and has been so
17 designated in the City-approved plans and CEQA documents prepared with respect to the Great Park.
18 In contrast to this intended purpose, the 100-Acre Plan and now the West Alton Plan would allow a

19 private real estate developer to develop the land for entirely private uses.

20 7. Like the EIR for the 100-Acre Plan, the County determined--in total disregard for
21 established principles of California law--that the West Alton Plan was exempt from both the City
22 and County's General Plans, the City and County's Zoning Codes, approval by any planning
23 commission, and all other public hearing and notice provisions of the City and County. Accordingly,
24 the West Alton Plan was analyzed and approved without any consideration by any planning
25

27 1 The case was originally filed in Orange County Superior Court as Heritage Fields El Toro, LLC
28 V. County of Orange, et al., Case No. 30-2017-00960230-CU-TT-CXC, and was transferred to and is now pending in Sacramento County Superior Court as Heritage Fields El Toro, LLC v. County of Orange, et al., Case No. 34-2018-80002879-CU-WM-GDS.

commission or without even so much as a single noticed public hearing for City or County planning

2 review.

3 8. In other words, the West Alton Plan and 100-Acre Plan stand alone, exempt from all
4 Istandards and procedures applicable to every other development in the State of California. In making
5 this erroneous determination, the County compounded the error by failing to analyze in the EIR the
6 significant land use incompatibilities created by allowing the West Alton Plan's residential
7 |development, in place of the originally approved public and agricultural/preservation uses. Not only is
8 the West Alton Plan inconsistent with the current zoning in the City of Irvine, it is also inconsistent
9 with the requirements of "Measure W" (a citizen's initiative approved by the voters of the County in
10 2002, which reserved the subject property for open space and public/educational uses). None of these
11 inconsistencies was disclosed or analyzed in the EIR as required by CEQA.

12 9. Moreover, the EIR failed to respond to comments raised by Heritage Fields and other
13 concerned members of the public, a failed to make a good-faith effort at disclosure as required by CEQA,
14 lignored applicable City and County parkland standards, improperly segmented environmental review,
15 improperly deferred mitigation measures, and misrepresented the truc provisions of the West Alton
16 Plan. Additionally, the County failed to recirculate the EIR as required by CEQA despite revealing a
17 complete reversal of the EIR's analysis of greenhouse gas emissions shortly before the County Board
18 of Supervisors approved the Project.

19 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

20 10. This Court has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1094.5 of the Code of

21 Civil Procedure and section 21168 of the Public Resources Code.

22 11. This Court also has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1085 of the Code of

23 Civil Procedure, and section 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.

24 12. Venue for this action properly lies in the Orange County Superior Court because the
25 property on which the Lowe Development Plan is located is in the County of Orange.
26 13. This petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167
27 and CEQA Guidelines section 15112.

1 PARTIES

2 14. Petitioner HERITAGE FIELDS is the owner of land within the MCAS EI Toro

3 Property, which is immediately adjacent to the West Alton Parcel on which the new development

4 would take place. Heritage Fields is also the master developer of the Great Park Neighborhoods

5 within the boundaries of the former MCAS El Toro Property. Heritage Fields purchased the MCAS

6 EI Toro Property from the United States Department of the Navy, and as part of the original

7 entitlement process, Heritage Fields conveyed more than 1,100 acres of former MCAS El Toro

8 Property to the City of Irvine and contributed substantial financial resources toward the coordinated

9 development of a great metropolitan park, now known as the "Orange County Great Park" that is

10 intended to provide cultural, athletic, recreational, agricultural and aesthetic amenities to residents

11 throughout Southern California.

12 15. On information and belief, Respondent COUNTY OF ORANGE is a political
13 subdivision of the State of California, and is the lead agency under CEQA for the West Alton Plan.

14 16. On information and belief, Real Party in Interest LOWE ENTERPRISES REAL

15 ESTATE GROUP, a California corporation, is the "Developer for the County's El Toro parcels,"
16 including the West Alton Parcel.

17 17. The names and capacities, whether corporate, individual, or otherwise, of Defendants

18 Does through 100, inclusive, are unknown to Heritage Fields at this time. Heritage Fields therefore

19 sues these Defendants, and each of them, by such fictitious names. Heritage Fields will seek leave of

20 court to amend this complaint to show the true names and capacities of the Doe Defendants when
21 they are fully ascertained. Heritage Fields is informed and believes that the Doe Defendants are

22 responsible and liable to Heritage Fields for the events, happenings and occurrences set forth herein.

23 STATEMENT OF FACTS

24 18. Following the decision by the Department of the Navy in 1993 to close the nearly

25 4,700-acre Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, the County sought to pursue a large-scale commercial
26 airport on the MCAS EI Toro Property. Instead, to ensure that Orange County would receive a
27 regional park, the voters of Orange County decisively halted the County's plan by approving Measure
28 W on March 5, 2002. Measure W changed the allowed reuse of the MCAS El Toro Property to a

Gibson, Dunn &
Crutcher L.I.P 5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

plan consisting exclusively of educational, recreational, open space, cultural and other public uses as

2 long as the land remained unincorporated. To guarantee that the Board of Supervisors would honor

3 those plans, Measure W enshrined those protections in the County General Plan and required that any

4 change of that designation while the land remained unincorporated must be submitted to a vote of the

5 people.

6 19. In 2003, the City, former Irvine Redevelopment Agency, and County entered into a

7 Pre-Annexation Agreement, which was intended to facilitate the City's annexation of the vast

8 majority of the former MCAS EI Toro Property, and the ultimate transfer of the land to future owners
and developers of the MCAS El Toro Property (a role ultimately secured by Heritage Fields after it

10 purchased the MCAS El Toro Property). To achieve that end, the Pre-Annexation Agreement

11 provided that:

12 The County agrees to pay its fair share of costs as part of the funding
13 mechanism [City] was to set up to fund the costs of building "necessary infrastructure and related improvements." (Section 2.2.5.)
14 [City] will provide "through a Development Agreement between Irvine and
15 the purchaser(s) of El Toro property" (now Heritage Fields) for the conveyance of certain parcels to the County in the manner prescribed in the
16 Pre-Annexation Agreement. (Section 2.2.3.4.)

17 The City and County would "agree to cooperate and work together with the Navy to cause the expeditious transfer of the El Toro property." (Section 4.)
18 20. In exchange for the County's agreement to allow the City to annex the vast majority of
19 the former MCAS EI Toro Property, the City agreed to zone the County's parcels, including the West
20 Alton Parcel, for the "exclusive use of the County or its designees, lessees, or concessionaires ... to

21 construct and operate permitted uses and facilities." (Section 2.2.3.1.)

22 21. Section 2.2.4 of the Pre-Annexation Agreement further provides that "Irvine will zone
23 County's parcels and designate them in Irvine's General Plan, in accordance with County direction."
24 In addition, the "County shall retain exclusive land use control over [its parcels within the MCAS EI

25 Toro Property], and shall be entitled to place any development upon said parcels that County shall
26 determine to be desirable for County's needs, as though said property remained unincorporated,
27 without the obligations for payment to Irvine of any permit fees or other mitigation/impact fees, other
28 than in Section 2.2.5, including but not limited to the following uses, all of which Irvine agrees with:

Animal shelter; Environmental health facilities; Automotive / equipment repair facilities; childcare

2 facilities; youth and family resource center; Law enforcement training facilities; emergency shelter;

3 Transitional shelter care facility; Children & Family Services Center; Business offices; Warehouses;

4 Storage facilities; Vehicle parking and storage facilities; Heavy equipment and storage; Field

5 operations and maintenance facility."

6 22. Consistent with the process first established by the Pre-Annexation Agreement, the

7 City and the purchaser of the MCAS EI Toro Property (Heritage Fields) entered into a Development

8 Agreement dated as of July 12, 2005 governing the future development of the MCAS El Toro

9 Property. The Development Agreement was subsequently amended and restated in December 2010

10 in the Amended and Restated Development Agreement ("ARDA"). Both the original development
11 agreement and the ARDA were adopta pursuant to Section 65864 et seq. of the California

12 Government Code (the "Development Agreement Statute"), which authorizes a local agency to vest a
13 property owner's development rights on its property in accordance with the land use regulations and

14 zoning/land use designations applicable at the time the development agreement was entered into. At
15 the time the development agreement and the ARDA wore entered into, the zoning designations

16 applicable to the West Alton Parcel were Preservation and Exclusive Agriculture.

17 23. Section 7.9 of the ARDA further acknowledged the County's obligation set forth in

18 the Pre-Annexation Agreement to pay for its fair share of infrastructure improvements, required the
19 City to actively enforce these provisions of the Pre-Annexation Agreement, and recognized the fact
20 that nothing in the Development Agreement should be a deemed as a "waiver by Heritage Fields of any
21 rights Heritage Fields" has against the County with respect to enforcing the Pre-Annexation

22 Agreement.

23 24. In 2006, the County acknowledged the limited uses to which the West Alton Parcel

24 may be put, writing to the Orange County Grand Jury that:
25 Irvine agreed to the County sharing in a certain percentage of the
26 property taxes as well as receipt of certain parcels of property, totaling approximately 240 acres to be used for certain County purposes such as
27 a Youth and Family Resource Center, an animal shelter, childcare facilities, law enforcement training facilities, and an emergency shelter.

25.

2 Eight years after this admission and more than ten years after the Pre-Annexation
Agreement was enacted, on January 28, 2014, the County Board of Supervisors approved a

A Disposition and Development Agreement with Lowe as the Developer of both the County's West
a Alton Parcel and a nearby parcel of land also conveyed to the County pursuant to the Pre-Annexation

6 Agreement, the 100-Acre Property. On information and belief, Lowe proceeded to create

7 development plans that would allow for the development of private dwellings on the West Alton

8 Parcel and a combination of private offices, private dwellings, private retail, and private hotel uses on
the 100-Acre Property.

26.

10 A Notice of Preparation of a Draft EIR was released by the County and was filed with

11 the State Clearinghouse on December 19, 2014. The Draft EIR was released for a 60-day review

12 period on December 9, 2016. Sixteen governmental agencies and corporate or organizational

13 entities--including Heritage Fields-submitted comment letters during the review period raising

14 myriad of defects with the EIR, including but not limited to a failure to (i) accurately identify the

15 proper land use jurisdiction over the West Alton Parcel, (ii) adequately mitigate significant impacts to

16 parks and recreational uses in neighboring jurisdictions, (iii) accurately disclose inconsistencies with

17 applicable land use and air quality regulations, (iv) properly mitigate traffic impacts, (v) properly

18 analyze, disclose and mitigate air quality and greenhouse gas emission impacts, and (vi) properly
mitigate against impacts to the wildlife corridor.

19 27.

20 did not mail On May 23, 2018, the County released a Notice of Completion of the Final EIR, but

21 a copy of the Notice to Heritage Fields. Heritage Fields learned of the completion of the

22 Final EIR and its scheduled June 5, 2018 approval date before the Board of Supervisors just shortly

23 before June 5. By failing to provide the legally required notice, the County deprived Heritage Fields

24 of a full opportunity to review and provide additional comments to the Board of Supervisors on the

EIR.

25 28.

26 Buried in the responses and revisions to the Draft EIR is complete reversal of the

27 EIR's conclusions with respect to greenhouse gas emissions. The EIR does not fully explain this

28 conclusory reversal of position, and the cursory analysis contains substantive errors that the public
was never afforded the opportunity to comment on.

29. Omitted from these documents was any substantive County response to the objection

2 raised repeatedly by numerous commenters -including Heritage Fieldsthat the EIR's assumption

3 that the County, and not the City, has land use jurisdiction over the West Alton Parcel is incorrect as

4 a matter of law. Therefore, the County has not proceeded in a manner according to law, in violation

5 of CEQA.

6 30. On June 5, 2018, the Board of Supervisors heard objections to the West Alton Plan

7 from public speakers and received additional comment letters reiterating previous objections and

8 identifying new failures to comply with CEQA arising from the Final EIR's responses to comments.

9 The County Board of Supervisors nevertheless certified the EIR, adopted the Statement of Overriding
10 Considerations, and approved the West Alton Plan.

11 31. A Notice of Determination was filed by the County on June 5, 2018.

12 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

13 32. Heritage Fields objected to the West Alton Plan in the administrative proceedings, and
14 fully exhausted its administrative remedies, including the submission of at least two letters raising
15 issues with the adequacy of the EIR and objections to the legally flawed process.
16 33. Either Heritage Fields or other commenters in the CEQA administrative process raised
17 all factual and legal issues asserted under CEQA in this Petition. Heritage Fields has thus exhausted

18 all administrative remedies available to it, or such exhaustion is otherwise futile.

19 34. Heritage Fields has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by
20 providing the County with notice of its intention to commence the action. Proof of service of the

21 notice is attached as Exhibit 1. A copy of this Petition is being sent by registered mail to the Attorney

22 General of the State of California.

23 35. Heritage Fields elects to prepare the administrative record. A copy of that election is

24 attached as Exhibit 2.

7 County's Failure to Provide Adequate Notice of the EIR's Notice of Completion
37.

8 California Public Resources Code section 21092.2 requires a lead agency to mail

0 notices to persons who make a written request to the appropriate person at the agency for such

notices.

10 38.

11 By letter dated February 9, 2017 to Eric Hull, the County of Orange CEO Real

12 Estate/Land Development, Heritage Fields requested a copy of the Notice of Completion prepared for
the West Alton Plan EIR by reference to Section 21092.2 of the Public Resources Code.

13 39.

14 The County issued the Notice of Completion on May 23, 2018, but did not provide the

15 required Notice to Heritage Fields or otherwise substantially comply with the requirements of section
21092.2.

16 40.

17 As a result, Heritage Fields only learned of the Notice of Completion by happenstance

18 close to June 5, 2018, the date that the County Board of Supervisors was scheduled to consider

19 certification of the EIR. By failing to provide the legally required notice, the County deprived

20 Heritage Fields of a full opportunity to review and provide additional comments to the Board of
Supervisors on the EIR,

21 41.

22 Because there was no compliance with section 21092.2, the County should not have

23 certified the EIR on June 5, 2018, and should have allotted more time for Heritage Fields' review and
comment on the Final EIR. The EIR's certification should be invalidated for this reason.

24

25 The EIR Impermissibly Piecemealed Analysis: The West Alton Plan and 100-Acre Plan
Are One Project

26 42. CEQA Guidelines Section 15378 defines a

27 project to mean the "whole of an action."

28 CEQA prohibits the segmenting of a project into smaller components to avoid the risk that

Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP 10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

environmental impacts from each project segment will be "submerged," potentially leading to

2 cumulatively "disastrous consequences."

3 43. The County impermissibly splits the West Alton and 100-Acre portions of the Lowe

4 Development Project into two separate EIRs, released just weeks apart, despite the fact that Lowe has

5 the exclusive right to engage in a comprehensive development scheme for both the 100-Acre

6 Property and the West Alton Parcel pursuant to the same Disposition and Development Agreement
7 ("DDA") with the County. The DDA expressly defines the Lowe development scheme covering the

8 two parcels as a single "Project." Indeed, page of the DDA defines the "project" as Entitlements
9 which "will permit the development of an economically viable, mixed-used development for the
10 Property." The definition of the term "Project" unambiguously refers to a single mixed-use
11 development project. And "Property" is depicted and described in Exhibit A of the DDA as

12 including both the 100-Acre Property and the West Alton Parcel. Moreover, the development plans
13 for both portions of the project were prepared by Lowe.

14 44. The two property components not only share the same developer, they are both located
15 on the former MCAS El Toro Property, utilize the same roadways, and require similar amendments to
16 the same City Planning Area 51 zoning regulations. They also share the same architect/master
17 planner and contain largely parallel Development Plans. Lowe's development timeline (Exhibit F to

18 the DDA) treats the development of the West Alton and 100-Acre parcels as a single component and
19 even appears to anticipate a single CEQA review process:

20 Lowe's Task is to conduct a Site Assessment for both the 100-Acre and
21 West Alton Parcel concurrently;

22 Lowe's Task 2 is to create a (singular) "Master Plan/Specific Plan" for both the 100-Acre and West Alton Parcel concurrently;
23 Lowe's Task 3 is to evaluate infrastructure and financing for both the 100-
24 Acre and West Alton Parcel concurrently;

25 Lowe's Task 4 is to conduct research and technical studies for both the 100- Acre and West Alton Parcel concurrently;
26 Lowe's Task 5 is to comply with CEQA for both the 100-Acre and West
27 Alton Parcel concurrently; and

28 Lowe's Task 6 is to 6 gain entitlements for both the 100-Acre and West Alton Parcel concurrently.

Gibson, Dunn &
Crutcher LLP 11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

45. Given the integrated nature of the development plan for the two parcels, one EIR

2 should have analyzed both projects, and the County's failure to do so represents impermissible

3 segmentation of a unified project.
The Project Deseription Inaccurately Describes the County Role in the West Alton Plan
5 46. The EIR wrongly asserts that the County Board of Supervisors is the decision-making

6 body and effectively the CEQA applicant for the West Alton Plan. However, a private developer is
7 the real-party-in-interest and proponent of the development plans for the West Alton and 100-Acre

8 parcels.

9 47. The County uses this sleight of hand in an attempt to evade both City and County land
10 use regulations. California law does not allow a private developer to override local land use
11 jurisdiction simply because that private developer is building on land owned by the County. Nor
12 could the County, when acting in a proprietary capacity as the owner of the land, and separate from
13 its core governmental mission, act in a manner contrary to the regulations of the applicable municipal
14 government.

15 48. Here, a private developer's plan was the basis for the West Alton Plan, and the uses

16 are similar to other private development. Lowe is the formally approved author of the West Alton
17 Plan, and the development plan consistently anticipates that private applicants will implement the
18 West Alton Plan.

19 49. By characterizing the West Alton Plan as a County project, the EIR misrepresented the
20 project and misled the public.
21 The EIR Fails to Accurately Describe the Land Use Jurisdiction Applicable to the West
22 Alton Plan and Fails to Make a Good-Faith Effort to Disclose Conflicts with Applicable
23 General Plan and Zoning Ordinances

24 50. CEQA requires that a lead agency conduct an adequate environmental review prior to
25 approving a discretionary project. This duty includes an obligation to make: good-faith effort at full

26 disclosure to the public of all significant environmental effects that may occur as a result of the

27 Project.

28

Gibson, Dunn &
Crutcher LLP 12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

51. The EIR identifies Land Use/Planning as an appropriate environmental topic for

2 impacts analysis, and purports that the West Alton Plan's first objective is to build a project that is
3 compatible with the surrounding existing and planned land uses in the area.
t 4 52. But the EIR fails to make a good-faith effort to evaluate potential "conflicts with any
applicable land use plan, policy or regulation of an agency with jurisdiction over the project," as

6 required by CEQA and the EIR's Threshold 4.10-1. The EIR's failure to accurately describe this

7 impact renders the EIR inadequate and in violation of CEQA.

8 53. Any sufficient analysis of the West Alton Plan's consistency with applicable land use

9 controls requires the EIR to identify which land use controls apply. The EIR took the unsupportable

10 position that the Project is exempt from any land use requirements, including but not limited to City
11 and County General Plan and zoning requirements. All analysis in the EIR that flows from this

12 erroneous conclusion is necessarily flawed.

from all 13 54. Due to this extraordinary position that the West Alton Plan is exempt

14 planning, zoning, and land use regulations, the EIR fails to accurately disclose which plans are
15 applicable to the Project site. The EIR never provides an answer as to how land use impacts are to be
16 measured given that the EIR does not even disclose the policies and standards applicable to the
17 project.

18 55. Moreover, this position is contradicted elsewhere in the EIR. For example, the EIR
19 rejected Caltrans' comment that different thresholds of significance should be used by responding

20 that the West Alton Parcel is within the City and so City thresholds of significance should govern.
21 But elsewhere, the EIR rejects the use of City thresholds as inapplicable by arguing that the City has
22 no jurisdiction over the site. This position is also directly contradicted by the DDA (Exhibit F),
23 which requires Lowe to (among other tasks) (a) submit applications to the City of Irvine for a General

24 Plan Amendment, Zone Change(s), and Master Plan; (b) process through approval, a Tentative Tract
25 Map for the 100 Acre Parcel and Alton Parcels; and (c) negotiate a Development Agreement between

26 the County and City, if required.

2 relevant to CEQA analysis generally and to this EIR in particular, and the County's position that no

3 authority applies is contrary to law.

4 57. There is no immunity for private parties with respect to their own private pursuits

5 merely because a County happens to be the private party's landlord. Accordingly, the West Alton

6 Parcel, like all of its similarly situated neighboring properties, should be subject to City oversight and

7 regulation, and City standards and thresholds of significance should be utilized in all the EIR

8 analyses, and they were not. The EIR also did not fully or accurately identify the Project's

9 inconsistency with the City's TTOD Zoning, and thus failed to make the good-faith effort at

10 disclosure required by CEQA.

11 58. Alternatively, if the language of the Pre-Annexation Agreement stating that the West

12 Alton Parcel is to be treated as though it is unincorporated is correct, County regulations, plans, and
13 standards must apply. And, as noted in the recitals to the Pre-Annexation Agreement, the County's

14 Measure W applied open space and public use land use designations to the Property. The West Alton
15 Plan complies with none of these use restrictions and nonc of thesc development standards.

16 The EIR Inaccurately Analyzes the Project's Provision of Parkland

17 59. The EIR is required to evaluate significant impacts to existing park facilities that will

18 be caused by, for example, increased use of existing park facilities due to an insufficient supply of
19 parks provided by a new development.

20 60. The EIR fails to accurately or consistently evaluate the Project's provision of parkland

21 under this standard. First, Topical Response 3.1.5 (Parks) makes internally contradictory

22 interpretations of CEQA thresholds and obfuscates which standard the EIR is using to measure

23 impacts: just before it cites to the County zoning standards as the measure of determining a

24 significant impact under CEQA, the Response states that "neither the City's nor the County's typical

25 parkland standards apply to the proposed Project."

26 61. The Project is plainly inconsistent with the City's park standards, which are the

27 standards that should apply because the West Alton Parcel is located within the City. While the
28 County standard only requires 2.5 acres of parkland per 1,000 people, the City standards require a

Gibson, Dunn 8 Crutcher LLP 14
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 minimum of five acres per 1,000 people (consisting of two acres of community parks and three acres

2 of neighborhood parks).
UJ v 62. Additionally, the Final EIR's parkland analysis incorrectly identifies Beacon Park and
Pavilion Park as "public," and both are private parks. This is not a technical error. Failing to identify
5 these parks as private means the EIR wrongly assumes and informs the public that these parks will be

6 available to serve residents of the West Alton plan, and they will not. Therefore, the EIR does not

7 properly analyze and disclose the impacts of the new residents on existing park facilities.

8 The EIR' Public Services Analysis Is Deficient Because Impacts on Schools Are Greater

9 Than Disclosed and Inadequately Mitigated

10 63. The EIR assumes that the current capacity in the three Irvine Unified School District
11 schools assigned to the Project site is available to accommodate students that would be generated by
12 the Project, and hence that the students generated "would not exceed the available capacity of the
13 schools that would serve the Project." The analysis ignores the fact that attendance in these schools,
14 and the new Beacon Park K-8 School, will be taken up by students from existing, previously

15 approved and fully vested projects within the boundaries of the School District, so the analysis is

16 flawed.

17 64. Further, the failure of Lowe and the County to enter into mitigation agreement with
18 the School District means that (1) students from the West Alton Plan may lack access to the schools

19 identified in the EIR, and (2) the School District will have to construct additional school facilities

20 and/or redirect Project students to schools farther from the Project. The impacts of these reasonably
21 foresecable consequences of the Project were not adequately analyzed in the EIR.

22 65. The Project makes no commitment to provide necessary school facilities, and

23 impermissibly defers analysis to a later date.

24 The EIR Fails to Adequately Analyze or Mitigate Traffic Impacts

25 66. As pointed out in Heritage Fields' comment letter, the EIR does not depict the most

26 recently approved vested tentative tract maps for the Great Park Neighborhoods; therefore, it does not
27 disclose-let alone analyze the insufficient intersection spacing that the Project would create along
28 Irvine Boulevard between the primary and secondary entrances into the Project site.

Gibson, Dunn &
Crutcher LLP 15
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

67. The EIR acknowledges that the Project will contribute to significant traffic impacts,

2 and so mitigation is required. CEQA requires that mitigation measures be feasible and enforceable,

3 including with respect to legal impediments.

68. The Pre-Annexation Agreement provided that West Alton Parcel should be zoned to
allow use as a "Sheriff Agriculture & Habitat Mitigation Area," and the land is presently zoned as
Preservation and Exclusive Agriculture. Because of this agricultural/preservation designation, none

7 of the regional infrastructure studies, including those prepared for the North Irvine Transportation

8 Mitigation Program ("NITM"') and the Southern California Association of Governments' RTP/SCS,
accounted for traffic or other impacts that would be generated by the proposed residential
10 development on this Project site. And neither the County nor Lowe are members of NITM.
11 69. Rather than mitigating the significant traffic impacts, the Draft EIR provided that the

12 County will either request that it become a member of NITM or enter into a separate agreement with

13 the City. Recognizing this deficiency, the County dramatically re-worked the transportation
14 mitigation measures in the Final EIR to provide that the County would conduct a vaguely defined fee
15 reallocation study to establish the Project's fair share traffic mitigation fees. However, the Final EIR

16 establishes no standards for this fee reallocation study, and thus decision makers and members of the

17 public-including Heritage Fieldsthat rely on the NITM program are left wondering what (if

18 anything) this fee reallocation study will accomplish.

19 70. Revised mitigation measure MM TRAN-3 fails to meet CEQA's standards and fails to

20 resolve the fundamental flaw of the mitigation measure's original iteration because it continues to

21 require a future agreement to be reached between the City of Irvine and the County, but fails to

22 provide how fair share payments will be made if no such agreement is reached. The evidence does
23 not demonstrate that this measure will actually require Lowe and the County to mitigate the Project's
24 significant traffic impacts.

25 71. Moreover, CEQA Guidelines Section 15088.5 requires an environmental impact
26 report to be recirculated when "significant new information is added to the EIR" after it is released

27 for public comment but before it is certified. By dramatically altering the mitigation measure without
28

Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher | 16
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

providing a meaningful opportunity for the public to review the new information, the County failed to

2 proceed in the manner required by law.
ct Ut 72. This mitigation measure is wholly inadequate because it does not address what
happens if the County and/or Lowe are unable to reach the contemplated agreements, and the EIR
does not adequately specify the contents of the agreement. This leaves the adequacy and actual terms

6 of the mitigation obligation entirely uncertain and renders the assurances of mitigation illusory.

7 The EIR Improperly Defers Mitigation and Analysis to Subsequent Environmental

8 Reviews That May Never Occur

9 73. Topical Response 3.1.3 asserts that future development applications will be subject to

10 CEQA. However, as explained in that Topical Response, the West Alton Plan provides that
11 "decisions made by the Chief Real Estate Officer or the EI Toro Review Board on such appeals are
12 final."

13 74. Further, only the applicant, property owner, or ground lessee who submitted a written
14 comment during the courtesy review period may file an appeal. Thus, the subsequent public review
15 right is not meaningful, and does not make up for the failure to adequately disclose the known or
16 reasonably foreseeable impacts of the Project at this stage of the environmental review process.
17 The Greenhouse Gas Impact Conclusion Is Unsupported By Substantial Evidence and

18 the EIR Must Be Recirculated Due to the Addition of Significant New Information

19 75. CEQA Guidelines Section 15088.5 requires an environmental impact report to be
20 recirculated when "significant new information is added to the EIR" after it is released for public
21 comment but before it is certified.

22 76. The Final EIR reversed the conclusion of the Draft EIR with respect to whether the
23 West Alton Plan would cause a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions. The Draft EIR had

24 concluded that there would be significant and unavoidable impacts, but the Final EIR reversed this
25 conclusion. The Final EIR fails to fully explain this reversal of position, thus depriving members of
26 the public with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on this significant change.
27

28

Gibson, Dunn & Crutchel LLP 17
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

77.

2 Although the sudden change and brand-new analysis is not fully explained by the EIR,

W it appears that this sudden change is based (at least in part) on the addition of mitigation measures
that are not adequately quantified.

78. The EIR also fails to provide the analysis necessary to explain how the added GHG

6 mitigation measures resolve the impact under Significance Threshold 4.7-2, particularly given that
Topical Responses to other issues continue to indicate that the West Alton Plan conflicts with

8 applicable regional growth plans adopted, in part, to meet the State's greenhouse gas emission
reduction goals.

9 79.

10 The reversal of position is particularly confusing in light of the fact that Topical

11 Response 3.1.8 of the Final EIR continues to state that, although the Draft EIR explains why "the

12 Project would not conflict with the RTP/SCS goals, strategies, and policies" which were adopted to

13 achieve the State's greenhouse gas emission reduction goals, the "[Orange County Projections] data

14 set did not reflect the Project." On this basis Topical Response 3.1.8 concludes that the planning

15 level impacts of the Project remain significant and unavoidable. In other words, the Final EIR's

16 conclusory reversal of position on greenhouse gas emissions is internally contradicted by other

17 sections of the Final EIR, and thus unsupported by substantial evidence.

80.

18 The EIR's sudden reversal of its analysis requires further analysis, revisions to ensure

19 consistency, and recirculation So that the public and decision makers will not be deprived of a
meaningful opportunity to review and comment on the EIR.

20

21 The Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations Are Unsupported by
Substantial Evidence

22 81.

23 CEQA requires that a project with significant adverse impacts be approved only if the

24 lead agency makes findings-supported by substantial evidence--that the project's benefits will

25 outweigh its adverse impacts and that there are not feasible mitigation measures or less damaging
alternatives available.

26 82.

27 Because the EIR fails to accurately identify all of the Project's significant impacts, the

28 County never adopted findings to justify the Project's impacts in these areas. Thus, the Statement of
Overriding Considerations fails to meet CEQA requirements.

Gibson, Dunn &
Crutcher LLP 18
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

83. For all of the reasons set forth above, the Court should decertify the EIR and enjoin

2 the County and Lowe from taking any further action with respect to the Project, until a timely writ of

3 mandate is returned to this Court in compliance with CEQA, and the other applicable land use

4 regulations violated by Respondent's and Real Party's actions.
PRAYER FOR RELIEF

6 84. In each of the items enumerated above, the County has violated its duty under the law,

7 abused its discretion, failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and decided to take the actions

8 objected to without the support of substantial evidence. Accordingly, certification of the EIR and
approval of the West Alton Plan must be set aside.

10 85. Therefore, Heritage Fields prays for entry of judgment against the County and Real
11 Party in Interest Lowe as follows:

12 A. For an alternative and peremptory writ of mandate, commanding the County to
13 set aside and vacate the certification of the EIR, Findings and Statement of
14 Overriding Considerations supporting the approval of the West Alton Plan;

15 and to set aside and vacate approval of the West Alton Plan based upon the
16 EIR, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations;

17 B. For an order precluding the County and Lowe from taking any action to
18 construct facilities or infrastructure, or undertaking site preparation until an
19 adequate EIR is prepared and timely resubmitted to this Court;

20 C. For costs of the suit;

ADR Information

Introduction.

Most civil disputes are resolved without filing a lawsuit, and most civil lawsuits are resolved without a trial. The courts and others offer variety of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) processes to help people resolve disputes without a trial. ADR is usually less formal, less expensive, and less time-consuming than a trial. ADR can also give people more opportunity to determine when and how their dispute will be resolved.

BENEFITS OF ADR.

Using ADR may have a variety of benefits, depending on the type of ADR process used and the circumstances of the particular case. Some potential benefits of ADR are summarized below.
Save Time. A dispute often can be settled or decided much sooner with ADR; often in a matter of months, even weeks, while bringing a lawsuit to trial can take a year or more.

Save Money. When cases are resolved earlier through ADR, the parties may save some of the money they would have spent on attorney fees, court costs, experts' fees, and other litigation expenses.
Increase Control Over the Process and the Outcome. In ADR, parties typically play a greater role in shaping both the process and its outcome. In most ADR processes, parties have more opportunity to tell their side of the story than they do at trial. Some ADR processes, such as mediation, allow the parties to fashion creative resolutions that are not available in a trial. Other ADR processes, such as arbitration, allow the parties to choose an expert in a particular field to decide the dispute.
Preserve Relationships. ADR can be a less adversarial and hostile way a to resolve a dispute. For example, an experienced mediator can help the parties effectively communicate their needs and point of view to the other side. This can be an important advantage where the parties have a relationship to preserve.

Increase Satisfaction. In a trial, there is typically a winner and a loser. The loser is not likely to be happy, and even the winner may not be completely satisfied with the outcome. ADR can help the parties find win-win solutions and achieve their real goals. This, along with all of ADR's other potential advantages, may increase the parties' overall satisfaction with both the dispute resolution process and the
outcome.

Improve Attorney-Client Relationships. Attorneys may also benefit from ADR by being seen as problem-solvers rather than combatants. Quick, cost-effective, and satisfying resolutions are likely to produce happier clients and thus generate repeat business from clients and referrals of their friends and
associates.

DISADVANTAGES OF ADR.

ADR may not be suitable for every dispute.
Loss of protections. If ADR is binding, the parties normally give up most court protections, including a decision by a judge or jury under formal rules of evidence and procedure, and review for legal error by an appellate court.

L1200 (Rev. Oct. 2014) Page 2 of 4

Less discovery. There generally is less opportunity to find out about the other side's case with ADR than with litigation. ADR may not be effective if it takes place before the parties have sufficient information to resolve the dispute.
Additional costs. The neutral may charge a fee for his or her services. If a dispute is not resolved through ADR, the parties may have to put time and money into both ADR and a lawsuit.
Effect of delays if the dispute is not resolved. Lawsuits must be brought within specified periods of time, known as statues of limitation. Parties must be careful not to let a statute of limitations run out while
a dispute is in an ADR process.

TYPES OF ADR IN CIVIL CASES.

The most commonly used ADR processes are arbitration, mediation, neutral evaluation and settlement conferences.

Arbitration. In arbitration, a neutral person called an "arbitrator" hears arguments and evidence from each side and then decides the outcome of the dispute. Arbitration is less formal than a trial, and the rules
of evidence are often relaxed. Arbitration may be either "binding" or "nonbinding." Binding arbitration means that the parties waive their right to a trial and agree to accept the arbitrator's decision as final. Generally, there is no right to appeal an arbitrator's decision. Nonbinding arbitration means that the parties are free to request a trial if they do not accept the arbitrator's decision.

Cases for Which Arbitration May Be Appropriate. Arbitration is best for cases where the parties want another person to decide the outcome of their dispute for them but would like to avoid the formality, time, and expense of a trial. It may also be appropriate for complex matters where the parties want a decision-maker who has training or experience in the subject matter of the dispute.
Cases for Which Arbitration May Not Be Appropriate. If parties want to retain control over how their dispute is resolved, arbitration, particularly binding arbitration, is not appropriate. In binding arbitration, the parties generally cannot appeal the arbitrator's award, even if it is not supported by the evidence or the law. Even in nonbinding arbitration, if a party requests a trial and does not receive a more favorable result at trial than in arbitration, there may be penalties.
Mediation. In mediation, an impartial person called a "mediator" helps the parties try to reach a mutually acceptable resolution of the dispute. The mediator does not decide the dispute but helps the parties communicate so they can try to settle the dispute themselves. Mediation leaves control of the outcome with the parties.

Cases for Which Mediation May Be Appropriate. Mediation may be particularly useful when parties have a relationship they want to preserve. So when family members, neighbors, or business partners have a dispute, mediation may be the ADR process to use. Mediation is also effective when emotions are getting in the way of resolution. An effective mediator can hear the parties out and help them communicate with each other in an effective and nondestructive manner.

Cases for Which Mediation May Not Be Appropriate. Mediation may not be effective if one of the parties is unwilling to cooperate or compromise. Mediation also may not be effective if one of the parties has a significant advantage in power over the other. Therefore, it may not be a good choice if the parties a have a history of abuse or victimization.
Neutral Evaluation. In neutral evaluation, each party gets a chance to present the case to a neutral person called an "evaluator." The evaluator then gives an opinion on the strengths and weaknesses of each party's evidence and arguments and about how the dispute could be resolved. The evaluator iS

L1200 (Rev. Oct. 2014) Page 3 of 4

often an expert in the subject matter of the dispute. Although the evaluator's opinion is not binding, the parties typically use it as a basis for trying to negotiate a resolution of the dispute.
Cases for Which Neutral Evaluation May Be Appropriate. Neutral evaluation may be most appropriate in cases in which there are technical issues that require special expertise to resolve or the only significant issue in the case is the amount of damages.

Cases for Which Neutral Evaluation May Not Be Appropriate. Neutral evaluation may not be appropriate when there are significant personal or emotional barriers to resolving the dispute.
Settlement Conferences. Settlement conferences may be either mandatory or voluntary. In both types of settlement conferences, the parties and their attorneys meet with a judge or a neutral person called a "settlement officer" to discuss possible settlement of their dispute. The judge or settlement officer does not make a decision in the case but assists the parties in evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the case and in negotiating a settlement. Settlement conferences are appropriate in any case where settlement is an option. Mandatory settlement conferences are often held close to the date a case is set for trial.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

In addition to mediation, arbitration, neutral evaluation, and settlement conferences, there are other types of ADR, including conciliation, fact finding, mini-trials, and summary jury trials. Sometimes parties will try a combination of ADR types. The important thing is to try to find the type or types of ADR that are most likely to resolve your dispute.

ALL COMPLEX CIVIL DEPARTMENTS

Welcome to the Complex Civil Litigation Program. Orange County Superior Court is one of six courts designated by the California Judicial Council as pilot project courts to handle solely complex civil litigation. These pilot courts were established to apply case management principles to improve the effective administration of justice by reducing the time and expense normally associated with the litigation of complex civil cases. It has been our experience that these principles make it easier to prepare these cases for trial by providing a more orderly framework for the pre-trial phase of the litigation.
The result is a greater opportunity for early case resolution through mediation and settlement, and improving the way complex cases are tried by encouraging the use of technology.

Counsel's familiarity with the applicable California Rules of Court ["Local Rules"], Local Rules - Superior Court of California, County of Orange, and these Guidelines is expected. The Guidelines should answer most procedural questions and assist feeling comfortable in our courtrooms. you in

COURTROOM DEMEANOR, CONDUCT AND ETIQUETTE

Counsel are expected to adhere to the provisions of the California Attorney Guidelines of Civility and Professionalism, (State Bar of the State of California, adopted July 20, 2007, attached to these Guidelines as Appendix 1.)

1

GENERAL MATTERS

1. When issued by the court, the provisions of the Case Management Order in the particular action shall govern over these Guidelines. Procedural matters not provided for in these Guidelines or in a Case Management Order shall be governed by the pertinent provisions of the California statutes, the California Rules of Court, and the California Standards of Judicial Administration. The purpose of these Guidelines is to supplement but not contradict the law
governing civil procedure.

2. The Superior Court of California, County of Orange has established a system
for e-filing in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure $1010.6 and California Rules of Court, rule 2.250 et seq. All papers filed in complex civil cases must be electronically filed unless a party has been specifically excused by the Court from the requirement, pursuant to the Local Rules California, County of Orange ("local rules"), rule 308. Superior Court of
To register for the
program and to obtain additional information, go to:
www.occourts.org/complexcivil/

3. Cross-complainants must serve a copy of these guidelines and give notice of any scheduled hearings and depositions at the time the cross-complaint is served.

4. Information about filing requirements or fees is available on the court's Internet home page at: http://www.occourts.org, or by telephone at (657) 622-5314. The local rules are available on the court's public internet home page.
5. Telephone appearances are conducted through CourtCall, pursuant to the provisions of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.670. Parties are encouraged to seek further information concerning guidelines and protocols from CourtCall at (310) 342-0888 or (888) 88-COURT.

Il. Initial Case Management Conference:

The Initial Case Management Conference shall take place in conformance with the requirements set forth in California Rules of Court, rule 3.750. The Initial Case
Management Conference is generally scheduled approximately 90 days after the action is filed. Plaintiff is required to give notice of this conference date to all other parties. Thereafter, Status Conferences shall be set in consultation with the Court, according to the needs of the parties.

Ill. Case Management Conference and Status Conference Statements:

The judges of the Civil Complex Center have determined that Judicial Council form CM-
110, Civil Case Management Statement required by California Rules of Court, Rule 3.725(c) for some civil cases, is inadequate to provide the judges the information they need when determining how a particular complex case should be managed. Form CM- 110 should not be used in any action designated or provisionally designated as

2

complex. Instead, the parties shall file with the court either a Case Management Conference Statement or a Status Conference Statement as described below.

Counsel must file an updated Conference Statement for each Case Management or Status Conference. The Conference Statement is due no later than 5 court days prior to the hearing.
A Status Conference Statement may be filed as an alternative to the Case Management Conference Statement when appropriate. A Status Conference Statement is generally less detailed than a Case Management Conference Statement and is to be used to advise the court of progress or developments in the case which have occurred since the
last review hearing.

A joint statement of the parties is preferred by the court whenever possible.
IV. CASE MANAGEMENT ORDERS:
Case Management Orders are not required in all cases, but they may be helpful in cases where the sequencing and timing of key events is necessary in the management of the litigation and preparation of the case for trial. However, even if a Case Management Order is not necessary in a particular case, all complex cases must be managed by counsel, or the court, or both.
The goal of case management is to bring about a just resolution as speedily and economically as possible. To be effective, case management should be tailored to the needs of the particular litigation and to the resources available; make-work activity should be avoided. The parties or the court should develop and monitor an effective plan for the orderly conduct of pretrial and trial proceedings. A case management plan should prescribe a series of procedural steps, with firm dates, giving direction and order to the case as it progresses through pretrial proceedings to summary disposition or trial. The setting of interim time limits and deadlines is often a necessary part of an effective case management plan.

V. LAW AND MOTION:
1. Meet and Confer: This court adopts the view that pre-filing conferences between counsel may be useful in avoiding useless or unnecessary motions. Therefore, prior to the hearing of any motion, petition or application, except applications to appear pro hac vice and motions to withdraw as counsel of record, all counsel and parties appearing in propria persona shall confer in a good faith attempt to eliminate the necessity of the hearing or resolve as many disputes as possible.
Counsel for the moving party shall arrange the conference to meet and confer and, at least 3 calendar days before the hearing, file with the court a statement entitled "Meet and Confer," summarizing the issues remaining in dispute and the respective positions taken.

3

2. Tentative Rulings: Members of the Complex Civil Panel may publish tentative law and motion rulings by any system described in Local Rule 382.
3. Off Calendars and Continuances: In order to promote judicial economy and avoid wasting court resources, counsel for moving parties must notify the courtroom clerk as soon as possible if any matter will be taken off calendar. Stipulations between the parties to continue a matter must be approved by the court.

VI. EX PARTE APPLICATIONS:

1 . The court's consideration of an ex parte application will not interfere with or delay any trial in progress. The moving party is expected to adhere to the provisions of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1200 3.1207. All papers necessary to the determination of the application, including any proposed pleading, motion or order, must be submitted with the ex parte application. Counsel should contact the courtroom clerk to verify any specific deadlines for the submission of moving papers or other preferences applicable to that department. Counsel may also contact the courtroom clerk to inquire if oral argument will be permitted, or if the court will rule based on the application and any written opposition.
2. The application shall include a declaration of Notice of Ex Parte Hearing and a proposed order; and shall state in the notice the irreparable harm, immediate danger or other basis for ex parte relief that will result if the requested relief is not granted a until a regularly noticed motion may be heard.

VII. MANDATORY SETTLEMENT CONFERENCES ("MSC's"):

Compliance with Local Rule 316 is required.
All of the judges at the Civil Complex Center are willing to help another judge in the settlement of a complex case depending upon the judge's available calendar. If the parties agree to have a mandatory settlement conference conducted by a judge other than the assigned judge, the parties should first determine the other judge's availability before asking the assigned judge to order the settlement conference. However, it is not presumed that the judge to whom case is assigned should not conduct the mandatory settlement conferences in his or her cases. If a party objects to the trial judge's participation in the MSC, the party must advise the judge or the courtroom clerk of its objection prior to the setting of the MSC. Counsel are advised to check with the court to determine its preference in this regard.

VIII. Pre-trial Conferences

1. A Pre-trial Conference may be scheduled 30-90 days before trial for the purpose of determining the readiness of the parties and resolving procedural issues concerning the trial. The goal of the Pre-trial Conference is to make the trial proceed as predictably and smoothly as possible. The Pre-trial

4

Conference is not a substitute for the Issues Conference required by Local Rule 317.

2. At the Pre-trial Conference, counsel should be prepared to state whether his or her client will be using the electronic presentation of evidence at the trial. Using electronic equipment to present evidence at trial requires preparation, organization and cooperation by the parties. The court expects that the parties will work together in devising a protocol for the pre-marking of exhibits by using prefixes or a super-numeration system to designate the proponent of the evidence. Where there are multiple pages to a single exhibit, each page should be bates-stamped. Counsel should contact the courtroom clerk to determine if the trial judge has a specific preference for how exhibits should be marked.
3. In a case where it is reasonable to presume voluminous documents will be produced during discovery, counsel are urged to agree upon a protocol for the pre-marking of exhibits at the earliest time possible, preferably before the initiation of discovery and delivery to a document depository. It is less expensive to mark and index voluminous documents as they are deposited than when it is done on the eve of trial.

4. Counsel are required to cooperate throughout the trial so that one party's electronic exhibits are available to the other side to display during cross- examination.

5. The electronic version of documents, photographs, charts or other
demonstrative evidence may be substituted for the actual exhibit at trial upon the stipulation of the parties and order of the court. This guideline is not meant to alter the rules of discovery or the obligation of a party to make available the original of a document for inspection by another party through discovery or at the Issues Conference.

6. Physical exhibits and documents are not required to be presented in a digitalized format. However, evidence which has not been presented in electronic form customarily will be ordered by the court returned at the end of the appeal period to the party which offered it. Before trial commences, counsel will be asked to sign a stipulation for the return and maintenance of the exhibits. Plaintiff will maintain joint exhibits unless the court orders otherwise.
IX. Use of the Court's Evidence Presentation Systems
1. On-Site Electronic Evidence Presentation Systems: Every courtroom has the capability of being equipped with court-based evidence presentation systems for use by the parties. Counsel are strongly encouraged to take advantage of the benefits of the electronic presentation of evidence when in trial at the Civil Complex Center to enhance the orderly and effective presentation of evidence, reduce concerns about the custody and security of exhibits, and reduce the work and expense associated with the tagging, storing and transporting of exhibits. In an appropriate case, the court may require the

use of an electronic evidence presentation system. Electronic evidence
presentation systems must be compatible with the court's infrastructure (video distribution amplifier, wiring, conduit, floor receptacles and connectors).
2. Electronic Evidence Standard Format: Counsel presenting evidence that is exclusively electronic in form must present the evidence in PDF file format and stored on CD-R. Whenever evidence is presented electronically, the physical custody of exhibits by the clerk is replaced by the electronic record of the exhibits. Evidence must be in sequential order with the exception of JPEG and MPEG files which shall be stored on separate discs. Counsel may also prepare electronic evidence using alternate non-proprietary formats subject to the approval of the court. The compact discs (CDs) must be labeled as follows:

Case #
Case Name
Exhibits to
(Original or Backup copy)

The courtroom clerk will maintain an updated exhibit list. When evidence is electronically presented at the trial, the court may require counsel to periodically submit to the clerk an up-to-date CD containing exhibits received into evidence.

It is counsels' responsibility to identify and track redactions, modifications, and substitution of exhibits. Counsel are expected to be prepared to submit an up- to-date evidence CD with all redactions, modifications, and substitutions, as well as impeachment documents used, upon the courtroom clerk's request.
Impeachment exhibits are not pre-marked. However, counsel are responsible for having the document electronically recorded upon being offered into evidence (exhibit numbers may be reserved for this purpose).
If the jury will be provided the evidence in electronic format for its deliberation, the parties are required to meet and confer and submit the final joint exhibit list containing only those exhibits received into evidence. The CD used by the jurors must include the joint exhibit list and the electronically stored exhibits which have been entered into evidence. Submission of the joint evidence CD also serves as a stipulation that all exhibits presented in electronic form to the jury are complete and correct. Any disagreement must be brought to the attention of the court at the earliest reasonable time. Counsel must lodge two (2) evidence CDs of all exhibits received into evidence.

X. TRIALS - MOTIONS IN LIMINE

Counsel should attempt to resolve evidentiary disputes at the Local Rule 317 Issues Conference before resorting to filing a motion in limine. It is frequently more productive
of court time, and the client's money for counsel to informally address at the Issues Conference the issues which could be raised in motions in limine and, instead of a motion, present a stipulation to the court on uncontested issues. Matters of day-to-day

6

trial logistics and common professional courtesy should not be the subject of motions in limine. These are matters of common professional courtesy that should be accorded counsel in all trials. See, Kelly v. New West Federal Savings (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 659,671.
