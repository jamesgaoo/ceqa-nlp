20 INTRODUCTION

21 1. Petitioners Scott Schreiber and Jessica Sabbah-Mani (hereinafter,
22 "Petitioners") hereby petition this Court, pursuant to, inter alia, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code §§
23 1085, 1094.5 & 1094.6 and Cal. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168 & 21168.5 (the California
24 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA")) for a writ of mandate directed to respondents to

25 vacate and annul the "Letter of Determination" of the City Planning Commission of the
26 City of Los Angeles (the "Planning Commission") dated March 16, 2018, in Case No.

27 CPC-2016-2203-DB and CEQA No. ENV-2016-2204-CE, approving plans for the

28 construction of a 75 foot tall luxury apartment development at 488-498 San Vicente

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Boulevard, Los Angeles, California 90048 (the "Project"), and to compel the Planning
2 Commission to consider approval of the Project in the manner required by law.
2. The developer of the Project, in return for five (5) deed-restricted affordable
units, seeks to construct the Project 30 feet and four stories higher than local zoning law

6 allows while also benefitting from numerous other "off-menu" concessions. The Project is
an abuse of the City's density bonus ordinance (Los Angeles Municipal Code, ch. 1, art. 2,

7 sec. 12.22, sub-sec. A.25, hereinafter, "L.A.M.C. 12.22 A.25"), which only permits "off-

8 menu" zoning concessions (i.e. those not mandated by state law) when they are needed to

9 make the construction of deed-restricted, affordable housing economically feasible. The

10- developer's requested variances from local zoning laws bear no relation whatsoever to

11 what is needed to feasibly include affordable housing in the Project. Rather, the

12 construction of the five units of affordable housing is being parlayed into an opportunity to :

13 generate windfall profit. The developer's windfall is the local neighborhood's loss, and, #..

more pertinently, it violates state and local law. ;

14 3.
15 In its findings approving the Project, the Planning Commission erred in its **. 5,

16 interpretation and application of the law and otherwise overstepped the bounds of its

17 discretion. If the Planning Commission had properly identified and construed the relevant H. .

18 legal standards and considered the relevant evidence, it would have been forced to

19 acknowledge that approval of the Project was without legal basis and beyond its

20 jurisdiction. The Court exercises de novo independent judgment on review of the Planning %

21 Commission's incorrect interpretation of the relevant law and should vacate the Planning
Commission's decision on this basis.
22

23 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 1085 and Cal. Pub.
24 Res. Code § 21168.9.
25 5. Venue is proper in this Court because the acts and omissions complained of
26 herein occurred in Los Angeles County (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 393). Respondent, the
27 City of Los Angeles (*Respondent") is situated in Los Angeles County (Cal. Civ. Proc.
28 Code § 394(a)). The real properties that are the subject of this petition are situated in Los

3054674.1 -2- VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- Angeles County (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 392(a)).

2 PARTIES

3 6. Petitioners reside in a single family, residential home at 6706 Drexel
4 Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90064, approximately 100 feet east of the Project that is
5 the subject of this petition.

6 7. Respondent is a California charter city and a "local agency" as defined in

7 Cal. Gov't Code § 54591(a)) with responsibility for planning, building and safety and
8 related administrative functions in connection with the construction of new and infill
9 development within its boundaries, as well as for enforcing local, state and federal law in
10 connection with.same..

11 8. Respondent delegates certain executive functions during the planning and
12 permitting process to the Planning Commission.

13 9. Respondent Kiwi Neman is an individual, who upon information and belief
14 resides in the County of Los Angeles, and is an applicant for and recipient of approvals in
15 connection with the Project, and is therefore a real party in interest to this Petition.
16 10. Respondent 488 San Vicente, LLC is a California limited liability company
17 with its principal place of business in the County of Los Angeles, and is an applicant for
18 and recipient of approvals in connection with the Project, and is therefore a real party in
19 interest to this Petition.

20 11. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of respondents sued
21 herein as Does through 10, inclusive, and therefore sues these respondents by such
22 fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this petition to allege their true names and
23 capacities when ascertained. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that
24 each of these fictitiously named respondents is responsible in some manner for the acts and
25 omissions herein alleged.

26 STATUTORY BACKGROUND

27 12. California's Density Bonus Law (Cal. Gov't Code §g 65915-65918), which
28 mandates that every city and county adopt a density bonus ordinance consistent with it,

3054674.1 -3-.
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT ÖF MANDATE

- was first enacted in 1979. In recent years it has been modified in almost every legislative
2 session. The overall purpose of the law, which is laudable, is to encourage construction of
3 affordable housing by requiring local governments to increase the number of allowable
4 residential units and provide additional concessions and incentives to builders. However,
5 due to the complexity of the law, the constant flux of the law's text in recent years, and
6 because the law provides for an award of attorneys' fees and costs against a local authority
7 that refuses to grant an application that complies with the law, municipalities are
8 themselves incentivized to err on the side of approval of any project that contains any
9 affordable housing. The Project at issue is an example of that. The Planning Commission
10- has approved construction that violates local zoning laws-and ignores local democratic_
11 controls even though the state law does not compel such an approval. The state law
12 overrides certain zoning controls and development standards, but it does not shred them
13 all.

14 13. Some of the key requirements and provisions of the state law, as relevant to
15 this petition, can be summarized as follows:

16

17 (a) The City is required to grant a density bonus according to a specified
formula to qualified applicants that incorporate affordable housing into their development
18 projects (Cal. Gov't Code § 65915(b)(1));
19 (b) In the case of the Project, the developer qualified for a density bonus of
20 35% because 11% of the proposed development consists of "Very Low Income" housing
21 units (Cal. Gov't Code § 65915(f)(2));

22

23 (c) "The granting of a density bonus shall not require, or be interpreted, in
and of itself, to require a general plan amendment, local coastal plan amendment, zoning
24 change, or

25 other discretionary approval" (Cal. Gov't Code 65915(f)(5));
(d) "Except as [otherwise] provided.. . the granting of density bonus shall
26 not require or be interpreted to require the waiver of a local ordinance or provisions of a
27 local ordinance unrelated to development standards" (Cal. Gov't Code § 65915(j)(2);

28

3054674.1 -4- VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- (e) The City is required to grant, under another formula, a specified number
2 of "incentives and concessions". (Cal. Gov't Code § 65915(b)(1), (d).) Significantly for
3 this case, the State density bonus statute prescribes by definition that a "concession or
4 incentive" may be granted only if it will reduce development costs. (Cal, Gov't Code co.
5 65915(k));
(f) In the case of the Project, the developer is entitled to two (2) concessions
or incentives because at least 10% of the total units in the proposed development consist of
8 "Very Low Income" housing units (Cal. Gov't Code § 65915(d)(2)(B));
(g) "The granting of a concession or incentive shall not require or be
-101 interpreted, in and of itself, to require a general plan-amendment, local coastal-plan-
11 amendment, zoning change, study, or other discretionary approval." (Cal. Gov't Code §
12 65915()(1);

13 (h) Additionally, a local authority is not permitted to apply any development
14 standard that will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a
15 development meeting the requirements of the state law at the densities or with the
16 concessions or incentives required by the state law, unless waiver or reduction of the
17 development standard would have a specific, adverse impact on health, safety or the
18 physical environment for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate Or
19. avoid the specific adverse impact (Cal. Gov't Code § 65915(e) (emphasis added)).

20

21 14. TY'S DENSITY BONUS ORDINANCE

22 Respondent has adopted a density bonus ordinance, with the stated purpose

23 of establishing procedures for implementing state density bonus requirements. (L.A.M.C.
12.22 A.25(a).)

24 15.

25 follows: Some of the key portions of the local ordinance can be summarized as

26 (a) L.A.M.C. 12.22 A.25(c)(1) incorporates the state law's formula for
27 density bonuses, including subsection (f)(2)'s 35% density bonus for developments with
28 11% of "Very Low Income" housing units;

3054674.1 -5- VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

(b) L.A.M.C. 12.22 A.25(e)(1) incorporates the state law's formula for
2 concessions and incentives, including subsection (d)(2)(B)'s requirement to provide two

3 (2) incentives and concessions to developments with 10% or more of units restricted for
"Very Low Income" housing. The City's ordinance then sets forth a "Menu of

6 Incentives," which the developer may choose from (L.A.M.C. 12.22 A.25(f));
(c) L..A.M.C. 12.22 A.25(g)(3) makes further provision for "off-menu"
7 concessions and incentives. Specifically, a developer may request "a waiver or
8 modification of any development standard(s) that is not included on the Menu of 3

9 Incentives." Such a request

10

11 shall include-a pro forma or other documentation to show that the waiver or modification of any development standard(s) are

12 needed in order to make the Restricted Affordable Units economically feasible

13 L.A.M.C. 12.22 A.25(g)(2)c.(i) & (3)(i)a (emphasis added). The request shall be approved ...

14  unless the decision-maker, based upon substantial evidence, makes a finding that ;

15 *

16 The Incentive is not required in order to provide for affordable housing costs

17

18 L.A.M.C. 12.22 A.25(g)(2)c.(i) & (3)(ii)c (emphasis added). * *, 3 " **

16. Petitioners are informed and believe, and based on such information and
19 belief allege, that the applicant Respondents never submitted the required proforma or
20  other documentation required for an off-menu incentive, and that the City's Planning
21 Commission had no such proforma or documentation before it when it approved the
22 application. The record before the Planning Commission was devoid of substantial
23 l evidence that the requested incentives were needed to make the Restricted Affordable
24 Units economically feasible, and indeed the only substantial evidence in the record
25 concerning economic feasibility demonstrates that the additional four stories of height and
26 other incentives were not physically or economically necessary for the affordable units,
27 and indeed make the project much more expensive to build.
28

3054674.1 -he
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

17. At the Planning Commission hearing on this project on March 8, 2018, City
2 staff stated that economic feasibility could not legally be considered. Several of the
3 Planning Commissioners remarked prior to voting on the motion to approve that their

4 "hands were tied" by state law, and there was no legal basis for them to deny any of the
requested incentives.

6 THE INCENTIVES AND CONCESSIONS REQUESTED FOR THE PROJECT

7 16. The developer requested four "off-menu" waivers and modifications under
8| L.A.M.C. 12.22 A.25(g) for which a heightened showing of necessity was required. These
9 were:

10 -(a) an-off-menu-request to allow a maximum Floor. Area Ratio of 4.1 to 1 in_
11 lieu of the otherwise permitted 1.5 to 1 in the local zoning code;

12 (b) an off-menu request to allow a maximum height of 75 feet and seven
13 stories in lieu of other otherwise permitted 45 feet and three stories in the local zoning
14 code;

15 (c) an off-menu request to waive the transitional height requirements of the
16 local zoning code, which exist to prevent structures that tower over adjacent properties that
17 are zoned for single family real estate; and

18 (d) an off-menu request to modify the Project's rear-yard setback
19 requirements.

20 THE PLANNING COMMISSION MISAPPLIED LOCAL LAW

21 17. Discussing the State Density Bonus Law in the "Project Analysis" section of
22 the report to the Planning Commission, the City Planner stated as follows:

23 Public commenters stated that the density bonus off-menu

24 requests violate State law and the City's zoning code, and that the project should seek a zone change or other legislative- entitlement to develop a building of the proposed scale.
25 Members of the public have taken issue with the fact that the project is requesting waivers and modifications of development
26 standards outside the menu of incentives recognized within

27 Senate Bill 1818 (SB 1818) and Los Angeles Municipal Code Section 12.22-A,25.

28 With Senate Bill 1818 (2004), state law created a requirement

3054674.1 -7- VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

2 that local jurisdictions approve a density bonus and up to. three "concessions or incentives" for projects that include defined

3 levels of affordable housing in their projects. In response to this requirement, the City of Los Angeles created an ordinance that included a menu of incentives (referred to as "on-menu" incentives) comprised of eight zoning adjustments that meet the definition of concessions or incentives in state law (California Govermment Code Section 65915). In addition,

6 pursuant to Government Code Section 65915(e)(1), the State Density Bonus Law states that a project may request other a

'~ "waiver[s] or reduction[s] of development standards that will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a

5 0 0 development meeting the [affordable set-aside percentage] criteria of subdivision (b) at the densities or with the concessions or incentives permitted under [State Density

10- Bonus Lawl, creating the avenue for developments to seek deviations from development standards outside the menu of concessions or incentives. The process for seeking off-menu

11 waivers and modifications has been-codified under LAMC Section 12.22-A,25(g)(3), and such request(s) shall be granted

12 unless the decision-making body finds that:

13 1. The Incentive Isnot required in order to provide for affor dable housing costs as defined in California Health and:

14 Safety Code Section 50052.5, or Section 50053 for rents for the affordable units; or

15 2. The Incentive will have a Specific Adverse Impact upon

16 publie health and safety or the physical environment or on any real property that is listed in the California Register of

17 Historical Resources and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avold the Specific Adverse Impact

18 without rendering the development unaffordable.to Very Low, Low and Moderale Income households. Inconsistency with the

19 zoning ordinance or general plan land use designation shall not constitute a specific, adverse impact upon the puiblic health or safety.

20

21 As detailed in Finding Nos. 1 and 2 for the request herein, neither was found to be the case. Thus, there would be no

22 . violation of state or local laws in approving the requested density bonus and off-menu requests for waivers and modifications of development standards.
23 (Emphasis in original)

24 18. The findings made by the City were not supported by substantial evidence in
25 the record. Specifically, the City Planner composed the following finding, which the
26 Planning Commission adopted:

27

28 Pursuant to Section 12.22 A.25(c) of the LAMC and Government Code Section 65915, the Director shall approve a

3054674.1 density bonus and requested incentive(s) unless the director

8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1

2 finds that the incentives do not result in identifiable and
actual cost reductions to provide for affordable housing costs

3 as defined in California Health and Safety Code Section 50052.5, or Section 50053 for rents for the affordable units.

4 The record does not contain substantial evidence that

5 would allow the City Planning Commission to make a finding that the requested Off-Menn waivers and

6 modifications do not result in identifiable and actual cost reduction to provide for affordable housing costs per State

7 Law. The California Health & Safety Code Sections 50052.5 and 50053 define formulas for calculating affordable housing

8 costs for Very Low, Low, and Moderate Income Households. Section 50052.5 addresses owner-occupied housing and Section 50053 addresses rental households. Affordable housing costs are a calculation of residential rent or ownership pricing

10 not to exceed 25 percent gross income based on area median* income thresholds dependent on affordability levels.

11 The off-menu requests for an increase in Floor Area Ratio,

12 increase in height and stories, waiver of transitional height requirements, and reduction in the required rear yard selback

13 are not expressed in the Menu of Incentives per LAMC Section 12:22-A,25(f) and, as such, are subject to LÁMC Section

14 12.22-A,25(g)(3). Granting of the off-menu requests would result in a building design or construction efficiencies that provide for affordable housing costs. The off-menu requests *.

15 allow the developer to expand the building envelope so that

16 additional affordable unifs can be constructed and the overall space dedicated to residential uses is increased. The increased

17 building envelope also ensures that all dwelling units are of a habitable size, while providing a variety of unit types. These

18 incentives support the applicant's decision to set aside five dwelling units for Very Low Income households for 55 years

19 as well as provide an additional five units for Moderate Income -*,*l

households. (emphasis added)

20 19.

21 The findings that the height increase, reduced setback, etc. will "allow the

22 developer to expand the building envelope" and will increase the "overall space dedicated
to residential use" are meaningless tautologies that say nothing about whether the

23

24 incentives are necessary to physically or economically provide the five deed-restricted

25 affordable units. Similarly, findings that the incentives "ensures that all dwelling units are
of a habitable size while providing a variety of unit types" is completely without

26 evidentiary support in this record.

27

28 20. Neither the City's ordinance nor state law provides that an applicant who
incorporates a certain number of affordable units is entitled to build at unlimited height and

3054674.1
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- bulk without any regard for applicable zoning and general plan standards. If that were the
2 standard intended by the State legislature and the City Council in enacting the density
3 bonus law and ordinance, local planning and zoning would be meaningless as to such
4 projects. The state law does not erode local democratic controls so dramatically.

5 20. The record was devoid of any financial proforma, or other substantial
6 evidence regarding the financial impacts of the requested concessions and incentives.

7 Indeed, the only evidence regarding costs was the evidence introduced by Petitioners of
8 published data indicating that construction costs escalate sharply as building heights

9

10 increase above two stories and again above five stories.

11 21. THE PROJECT'S ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT

12 The Planning Commission determined that an Environmental Impact Report
was not required for the Project because the Project is categorically exempt under Section
13 15332 of the CEQA Guidelines (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14, § 15332) as an infill development.
14 •To be exempt under this Section, an infill development must, among other things:
15 -be consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable
16 | general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and regulations;

17 -be within city limits on a project site of no more than five acres substantially
18 surrounded by urban uses;

19

20 -be without value as habitat for endangered, rare or threatened species;

21 -not result in any significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water
quality.

22

23 -be adequately served by all required utilities and public services.

22. The Planning Commission abused its discretion in finding that the Project
24 met the conditions for this categorical exemption. The Project is: (1) inconsistent with the
25 neighborhood protection provisions of the Wilshire Community Plan and with several
26 height, Floor Area Ratio, setback and parking standards of the Zoning Ordinance; and (2)
27 substantially surrounded by one and two-story single-family detached homes to the
28 northeast, east, southeast and west, characteristic of a low density suburban community.

3054674.1 -10-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

23. Additionally, public commenters, including Petitioners, identified unusual
2 circumstances that make use of a categorical exemption inappropriate and unlawful.
3 Specifically, the Project is uniquely situated abutting an R1 neighborhood and uniquely out
4 of proportion with the general plan and zoning limits. The Planning Commission
5 apparently found that unusual circumstances were present, but found that these unusual
6 circumstances did not prevent a categorical exemption because, according to the City

7 Planner, the "project will be required to adhere to any and all building code requirements
8 intended to reduce environmental impacts to less than significant levels." This was a
9 prejudicial abuse of discretion.

10 24. In addition to violating CEQA, the Planning Commission's disregard-for the
a 11 Project's environmental impacts was a violation of the aforementioned state and local
12 density bonus legislation, each of which requires the refusal of all density bonuses, -* • *s

13 incentives, concessions and other waivers if granting them would result in a "Specific *.g

14 Adverse Impact upon public health and safety or the physical environment. .. and for
15 which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the Specific Adverse
16 Impact without rendering the development unaffordable." L.A.M.C. 12,22 A.25(g)(2)c.(i),
17 and Cal. Gov't Code § 65915(d)(1)(B).

18 25. The Project exceeds (by more than 100% in the 33' transitional zone) the
19 transitional height standards, and it encroaches upon the protected R1 airspace in violation
20 of the Community Plan goals. This constitutes a Specific Adverse Impact which deprives
21 local residents of their privacy, light, air and quiet enjoyment of their property. There are
22 numerous ways in which these impacts could have been feasibly and satisfactorily
23 mitigated without rendering the development unaffordable. These options range from
24 reducing the expensive design features, to reduction in unit sizes, elimination of the ground
25 floor retail space, and lowering the 15° ceiling height of the ground floor to match the
26 standard 10' heights of the floors above. Indeed, the fact that the developer has proposed
27 to voluntarily restrict rents on five additional units to make them affordable to moderate-

28

3054674.1 -11-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 income households constitutes an admission that the Project will have surplus revenue
2 beyond what is necessary to maintain affordability on the five very-low income units.

41. The decision of the Planning Commission to apply a categorical CEQA

7 exemption to the Project was unlawful and should be annulled.
8 42. By applying a categorical CEQA exemption to the Project, Respondent has
proceeded without, or in excess of, its jurisdiction.

10 43. Respondent has prejudicially abused its-diseretion-in-applying a CEQA-
11 exemption to the Project because it has not proceeded in the manner required by law, and
12 because the decision to apply a categorical exemption is not supported by the findings, and
13 the findings are not supported by the evidence.
14 44. An administrative writ of mandate should issue commanding Respondent to
15 set aside the Letter of Determination and decision applying categorical CEQA exemption
16 and approving the Project density bonus and incentives, and further commanding the
17 Planning Commission to require an environmental impact report for the Project.

FINDINGS

Density Bonus/Affordable Housing Incentives Compliance Findings

1. Pursuant to Section 12.22 A.25(c) of the LAMC and Government Code Section 65915, the Director shall approve a density bonus and requested incentive(s) unless the director finds that the Incentives do not result in identiflable and actual cost
reductions to provide for affordable housing costs as defined in California Health
and Safety Code Section 50052.5, or Section 50053 for rents for the affordable units. *S.

The record does not contain substantlal evidence that would allow the City Planning
Commission to make a finding that the requested Off-Menu waivers and modifications do not result in identifiable and actual cost reduction to provide for affordable housing costs per State Law. The California Health & Safety Code Sections 50052.5 and 50053 define
formulas for calculating affordable housing costs for Very Low, Low, and Moderate Income Households. Section 50052.5 addresses owner-occupied housing and Section 50053 addresses rental households. Affordable housing costs are a calculation of residential rent or ownership pricing not to exceed 25 percent gross income based on area median -income-thresholds-dependent on affordability levels.
The off-menu requests for an increase in Floor Area Ratio, increase in height and stories, waiver of transitional height requirements, and reduction in the required rear yard setback
are not expressed in the Menu of Incentives per LAMC Section 12.22-A,25(f) and, as
such, are subject to LAMC Section 12.22-A,25(g)(3). Granting of the off-menu requests would result in a building design or construction efficlencies that provide for affordable housing costs. The off-menu requests allow the developer to expand the building envelope SO that additional affordable units can be constructed and the overall space dedicated to residential uses is increased. The increased building envelope also ensures that all dwelling units are of a habitable size, while providing variety of unit types. These incentives support the applicant's decision to set aside flve dwelling units for Very Low Income households for 55 years as well as provide an additional five units for Moderate
Income households. .1,4

2. Pursuant to Section 12.22 A.25(g)(3) of the LAMC, the decision-maker shall approve
a density bonus and requested waiver or modificatlon of any development standard unless the decision-maker, based upon substantial evidence, finds that the
incentive will have a specific adverse impact upon public health and safety or the
physical environment, or on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources and for which there are no feasible method to satisfactorily
mitigate or avoid the Specific Adverse Impact without rendering the development unaffordable to Very Low, Low and Moderate Income households. Inconsistency with the zoning ordinance or the general plan land use designation shall not
constitute a specific, adverse impact upon the public health or safety.

There is no evidence that the proposed incentives will have a specific adverse impact, A
"specific adverse impact" ls defined as, "a significant, quantifiable, direct and unavoidable
impact, based on objective, identified written public health or safety standards, policies, or conditions as they existed on the date the application was deemed complete" (LAMC Section 12.22.A.25(b)). The project does not involve a contributing structure in a designated Historic Preservation Overlay Zone or on the City of Los Angeles list of Historic-Cultural Monuments. It is also not located on a substandard street in a Hillside area or Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone. Finally, the project and potential impacts
were analyzed in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)

Case No. CPC-2016-2203-DB F-2

Guidelines and the City's L.A. CEQA Thresholds Guide. These two documents establish guidelines and threshoids of significant impact, and provide the data for determining whether or not the impacts of a proposed project reach or exceed those thresholds. Analysis of the proposed project determined that it is Categorically Exempt from environmental review pursuant to Article 19, Class 32 of the CEQA Guidelines. Therefore, there is no substantial evidence that the proposed project will have a specific adverse impact on the physical environment, on public health and safety.

Environmental Findings

3. Environmental Finding. Pursuant to State CEQA Guidelines and City of Los Angeles
CEQA Guidelines, a Categorical Exemption (ENV-2016-2204-CE) was prepared for the proposed project. Pursuant to Section 21084 of the California Public Resources Code, the above-referenced project has been determined not to have a significant effect on the environment and which shall, therefore, be exempt from the provisions of CEQA. On January 3, 2018, staff issued Categorical Exemption, Class 32 for the proposed project.
-A project qualifies for a Class 32 Categorical Exemption under State CEQA Guidelines Section 15322 if it is developed on an infill development project and meets the following
criteria:

(a) The project Is consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all ** g*

applicable general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and regulations:
The project site is located within the Wilshire Community Plan and designated for General Commercial land uses corresponding to the C1.5, C2, C4, RAS3, and
RAS4 Zones. The site is zoned C2-1VL-O and is thus consistent with the existing land use designation. The site is located within an "O" Oil Drilling Supplemental Use District where the drilling of oil wells or the production from the wells of oil, gases, or other hydrocarbon substances Is permitted pursuant to LAMC Section 13.01. However, neither the existing or proposed use involves oil drilling or production. As such, the provisions of said Code section do not apply to the proposed project and requested entitlement. The site is located within a City of Los a Angeles Transit Priority Area; it is not located within any specific plan, community design overlay, or interim control ordinance.
The project proposes the construction, use, and maintenance of a new, seven- story, 75-foot high, mixed-use bullding consisting of 54 residential dwelling units and approximately 5,651 square feet of commercial retall space. One of the stated residential goals of the filshire Community Plan is to "Provide a safe, secure, and high quality residential environment for all economic, age, and ethnic segments of the Wilshire Community,' Objective 1-1 states, "Provide for the preservation of existing quality housing, and for the development of new housing to meet the diverse economic and physical needs of the existing residents and expected new residents in the Wilshire Community Plan Area to the year 2010." Further, policies have been established to "Provide for adequate Multiple Family residential development" (Pollcy 1-1.3) and "Provide for housing along mixed-use boulevards where appropriate" (Pollcy 1-1.4). The project will meet the residential goals, objectives, and policies of the Community Plan by developing an underutilized site along San Vicente Boulevard with new mixed-income housing. The project will not displace any existing residents from the site. Furthermore, as a mixed-use development, the project will meet the Community Plan goal and policy of encouraging strong and competitive commercial sectors by providing additional

F-3 Case No. CPC-2016-2203-DB

opportunities for new commercial development and services along an established commercial boulevard.

The project is also consistent with the existing C2 zoning of the project site. The C2 Zone allows retail and residential uses as proposed. In accordance with State
Density Bonus laws and LAMC Section 12.22-A,25(g)(3), the applicant requests a walver of development standards to allow for deviations relating to floor area,
height, and setbacks in exchange for providing a minimum amount of affordable
housing as part of the proposed development. With approval of the waiver of development standards, the project will be consistent with the applicable zoning designation and regulations.

(b) The proposed development occurs within city limits on a project site of no more than five acres substantially surrounded by urban uses:
The project site is located in the Wilshire Community Plan area within the city limits of Los Angeles. The project site is approximately 14,470 square feet in size (approximately 0.33 acre). In addition, the project will be located on a site previously developed with commercial uses and is surrounded by other urban uses, Including single- and multi-family residential and commercial developments. Property directly north of the subject site are zoned C2-1VL-O and developed with a one-story commercial buildings. Further north, across Drexel Avenue, is an approximately 11-story medical office building. Property to the south across 5th Street is zoned C2-1VL-O and developed with a surface parking lot for an adjacent ***l
commercial building. Properties east of the subject site across the 20-foot alley are zoned R1-1-O-RFA and developed with a grouping of single-family homes. 4e •.
(c) The project site has no value as habitat for endangered, rare or threatened * t* species:

The project site is located in a dense urban environment that is fully developed with :

a wide range of urban uses, structures, and pavement. The site itself is currently
developed with single-story commercial structures. Existing development covers ** -**-*
the majority of the lot. Furthermore, although shrubs and trees are located on the project site; these shrubs and trees would not afford habitat for sensitive species, and there are no protected species as defined under Los Angeles Municipal % 1 Ordinance 177,404 and as detailed In the Tree Report prepared by Harmony Gardens dated March 3, 2017 on the project site. Therefore, the proposed project site has no value as habitat for endangered, rare or threatened species.

(d) Approval of the project would not result in any significant effects relating to
traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality:
The project site is currently developed with single-story commercial structures containing neighborhood-serving commercial uses and medical offices. The project involves the construction of a new, seven-story, 75-foot high, mixed-use building consisting of 54 residential dwelling units and approximately 5,651 square feet of commercial space. All construction-related impacts would be temporary in nature.
No permanent significant impacts are anticipated to occur.
Traffic, In a letter dated November 6, 2017, the Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT) concurred with the transportation analysis prepared by Gibson Transportation Consulting, dated May 31, 2017, which determined that the proposed development is not anticipated to result in any significant traffic impacts

Case No. CPC-2016-2203-DB F-4

at the two studied intersections: Orlando Avenue and 3rd Street and Orlando
Avenue / Gale Street and San Vicente Boulevard. Therefore, the project will not
cause a significant or substantial increase in traffic and traffic impacts will be less-
than-significant and no mitigation is required,
Noise. As discussed in the Noise and Vibration Impact Report prepared by CAJA Environmental Services, LLC, potential construction and operational noise impacts were found to be less than significant or have no impact. The project must comply with the City of Los Angeles Noise Ordinance No. 144,331 and 161,574 and any
subsequent ordinances, which prohibit the emission or creation of nolse beyond certain levels. The Ordinances cover both operational noise levels (i.e. post- construction), as well as any noise impact during construction. Section 41.40 of
the LAMC regulates noise from demolition and construction activities. Section 41.40 prohibits construction activity (including demolition) and repair work, where the use of any power tool, device, or equipment would disturb persons occupying sleeping quarters in any dwelling hotel, apartment, or other place of residence, between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and.7:00 a.m. Monday through Friday, and between 6:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. on-Saturdays and-holidays. All-such-activities-are-
also prohibited on Sundays. Section 112.05 of the LAMC also specifies the maximum noise level of construction machinery that can be generated in any residential zone of the city ar within 500 feet thereof. As a result of the project being required to comply with the above ordinances and regulations, it can be found that the project would not result in any significant noise impacts. All construction-related noise impacts would be less than significant and temporary in nature. No permanent significant impacts are anticipated to occur.

Air Quality. As discussed in the Alr Quality and Greenhouse Gases Impact Report prepared by CAJA Environmental Services, LLC, potential air quality impacts were found to be less than significant. The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) is the agency primarily responsible for **

comprehensive air pollution control in the South Coast Air Basin and reducing .*

emissions from area and point stationary, mobile, and indirect sources. SCAQMD prepared the 2012 Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP) to meet federal and state ambient air quality standards. A significant air quality Impact may occur if a project .. t.

is inconsistent with the AQMP or would in some way represent a substantial *...

hindrance to employing the policies or obtaining the goals of that plan. The proposed project will result in the construction of 54 residential units and 5,651 square feet of commercial space and is not expected to conflict with or obstruct the implementation of the AQMP and SCAQMD rules. Therefore, project impacts related to air quality will be less than significant.

During construction, appropriate dust control measures would be Implemented as part of the proposed project, as required by SCAQMD Rule 403 Fugitive Dust. Specifically, Rule 403 control requirements include, but are not limited to, applying water in sufficient quantities to prevent the generation of visible dust plumes, applying soll binders to uncovered areas, reestablishing ground cover as quickly as possible, utilizing a wheel washing system to remove bulk material from tires and vehicle undercarriages before vehicles exit the Project Site, and maintaining
effective cover over exposed areas.

Best Management Practices (BMP) will be implemented that would include (but not be limited to) the following:

F-5 Case No. CPC-2016-2203-DB

Unpaved demolition and construction areas shall be wetted at least three times daily during excavation and construction, and temporary dust covers shall be used to reduce emissions and meets SCAQMD Rule 403;
All dirt/soil loads shall be secured by trimming, watering or other appropriate
means to prevent spillage and dust; General contractors shall maintain and operate construction equipment to minimize exhaust emissions; and

EXCEPTIONS TO CATEGORICAL EXEMPTIONS

Planning staff evaluated the exceptions to the use of Categorical Exemptions for the proposed ordinance listed in "CEQA Guidelines" Section 15300.2 and determined that none of the exceptions apply to the proposed project:

Case No. CPC-2016-2203-DB F-6

(a) Location. Classes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 11 are qualified by consideration of where the project is to be located - a project that is ordinarily insignificant In its impact on the environment may in a particularly sensitive environment be
significant. Therefore, these classes are considered to apply all Instances,
except where the project may impact on an environmental resource of hazardous or critical concern where designated, precisely mapped, and
officially adopted pursuant to law by federal, state, or local agencies.
The project qualifies for Class 32 Categorical Exemption. Because the proposed Project is not defined as a Class 3, 4, 5, 6 or 11 project, this exception is inapplicable, The project site is not located in a particularly sensitive environment and would not be located on a site containing wetlands, endangered species, or
wildlife habitats The requested project will not impact an environmental resource of
hazardous or crifical concern where designated, precisely mapped, and officially
adopted pursuant to law by federal, state, or local agencies.

(b) Cumulative Impact. All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the cumulative Impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is significant.

The proposed project Involves the construction, use, and maintenance of a new, seven-story, 75-foot high, mixed-use building consisting of 54 residential dwelling units and approximately 5,651 square feet of commercial space. The project will
set aside five units (11 percent of the base density) for Very Low Income
Households and will set aside an additional five units for Moderate Income
Households. The project will provide 79 automobile parking spaces located within
three subterranean parking levels. Under LAMC Section 12.22-A,25, the requested
entitlement for a Density Bonus allows for the applicant to request certain deviations from the code (in this case, deviations relating to density, parking, floor
area, height, and setbacks) in exchange for providing a minimum amount of ....

affordable housing as part of the proposed development, subject to certain
findings.

The development of the project site with 54 dwelling units Is consistent with the
zone and land use designation of the site, as designated by the Wilshire
Community Plan, and as permitted by the City's Density Bonus Ordinance (LAMC
Section 12.22-A,25). A successive project of the same type and nature would
reflect a development that is consistent with the underlying land use designation and Los Angeles Municipal Code. Any such project would be subject to Regulatory Compliance Measures (RCMs), which require compliance with the City of Los
Angeles Noise Ordinance; pollutant discharge, building code and regulated
construction methods, dewatering, stormwater mitigations; and Best Management Practices for stormwater runoff. These RCMs will mitigate environmental Impacts
for an individual project and not create a cumulative impact.

Re: Case No. CPC-2016-2203-DB (488-498 South San Vicente Boulevard)
Agenda Item # 9 on March 8, 2018 Agenda

_Dear Commissioners,

This firm is legal counsel for Scott Schreiber and Jessica Sabbah-Mani, co-owners and residents of the
single-family home at 6706 Drexel Avenue, approximately 100' east of the subject property. On behalf of my clients, I am submitting these objections and hereby request that the discretionary density bonus application before you be denied.

This case presents an egregious and illegal misuse of the density bonus ordinance to attempt to insert a
towering 7-story luxury apartment building immediately adjacent to quiet R1 neighborhood. Along
with several other legal defects outlined below, the application misinterprets and perverts the use of "off-menu concessions and incentives" to eviscerate all applicable Community Plan and zoning controls. .•

The absurd result sought by the applicant is that a 35% density bonus would end up increasing the
allowable height of the bullding by almost 75% (from 45 feet to 75 feet) and increasing the F.A.R. by
more than 200% (from 1.5 to 4.1). While the five deed-restricted affordable units (out of 54 total units) may provide a laudable social benefit, they do not entitle the developer a free pass to disregard all zoning and development standards designed to insure compatibility with the adjacent R1 neighborhood.

1. THE REQUESTED OFF-MENU CONCESSIONS AND INCENTIVES ARE NOT LAWFUL OR
WARRANTED

The flawed rationale behind this application seems to be a mistaken assumption that there is effectively no limit to "off-menu" concessions and incentives. That assumption is expressly contrary to state law,
which limits all density bonus concessions and incentives only to those "that result in identifiable and
actual cost reductions to provide for ... rents for the targeted units to be set as specifled ... ." (Cal.
Gov't Code 565915(k).) In other words, there must be a well-documented showing that each concession
or incentive is necessary to make the project pencil out financially with the affordable units. - - •

This requirement to show financial necessity applies equally under the City's Density Bonus Ordinance,
the express purpose of which is to "implement State Density Bonus requirements, as set forth in
California Government Code Sections 65915 [et seq.]." (LAMC 12.22 A.25(a).)

4348 Hayman Avenue
La Cañada Flintridge, CA 91011

The City's application requirements emphasize the need for financial justification of concessions and incentives. Under the City's ordinance, a developer applying for an off-menu concession or incentive need only submit two things, one being a completed application form and the other being financial justification for the concession and incentive:
"The request [for off-menu concessions and incentives] shall be made on a form provided by the Department of City Planning, accompanied by applicable fees, and shall include a pro forma or other documentation to show that the waiver or modification of any development standard(s) are needed in order to make the Restricted Affordable Units economically feasible,." (LAMC 12.22 A.25(g)(3)(i)a. (emphasis added).)
This showing of financial justification is not a mere formality of the application process, but rather is the very heart of the matter in this case. The only discretionary decision before you at the upcoming hearing is whether or not to approve the requested off-menu concessions and incentives along with the density bonus. And according to your ordinance, the only criteria for your exercise of that discretion are whether the incentive or concession is (1) "required in order to provide for affordable .. rents for the affordable units"; or (il) (as discussed further below) the incentive or concession "will have a Specific Adverse Impact upon public health and safety or the physical environment or on any [registered historic resource] and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the Specific Adverse Impact without rendering the development unaffordable to Very Low, Low and-Moderate Income households." (LAMC 12.22 A,25(g)(3)(i)c., incorporating by reference Subparagraph (g)(2)(i)c.
(emphasis added).)

Given the centrality of such financial considerations, it is quite surprising that the 491-page agenda
package for the upcoming hearing contains no financial proforma or documentation or analysis whatsoever concerning the financial necessity for the requested concessions and incentives. The agenda materials include no information, for example, on whether any of the requested code waivers even meets the state law criteria for concessions that can lawfully be granted as part of a density bonus, -.. • . .*,
namely that they provide "identifiable and actual cost reductions" that make the affordable rents financially feasible. Indeed, it is doubtful that any of the requested incentives actually reduces costs. .*.*
Does an increase in allowable building height reduce costs? To the contrary, published data indicates that construction costs escalate sharply as building heights increase above two stories, and again over five stories, thereby requiring much higher rents for the project to pencil financially.'
Similarly, no data or analysis suggests that the reduction in yards and setbacks provides any reduction in cost or is necessary to achieve the affordable rents required for five of the 54 total units, Again, construction data cited in the footnote along with common sense would suggest that a smaller building with smaller units would generally be more affordable than a larger building with larger units. Floor plans for this project show that some of the units exceed 1,300 s.f., which is larger even than many detached single-family homes in this City. Undoubtedly costs could be brought down by reducing the size of some or all of the units, and this would not only reduce the number of concessions and incentives (if any) required for the project but also reduce the impacts of this outsized project on its R1 neighbors.

1 "Under current market conditions, for example, development of garden apartments (two-story structures with surface parking) require apartment rents of at least $1.00-$1.20 per square foot. Mid-rise apartment construction (five story buildings with structured parking) require rents in the $1.70-$2.10 per square foot range. And high-rise construction (greater than 5 storles, often requiring steel construction and underground parking) require rents In the $2.70-$2.90 per square foot range." Density at Any Cost (Mildner 2014), Center for Real Estate, Portland State University, https://www.pdx.edu/realestate/sites/www.pdx.edu.realestate/files/Mildner_UGR_artidle_3.pdf

In fact, of all the requested incentives and concessions, only the reduction in required parking qualifies
as a cost-reducing measure. Even the parking incentive, however, fails to meet the second prong of the
legal test, namely whether the incentive is necessary to provide the five very-low income units.

Furthermore, the plans and renderings show the project includes many expensive design features and
finishes, such as concrete floors, varying floorplate sizes, floor to ceiling plate glass, a solid cantilevered
roof canopy, and other features that substantially increase construction costs. It will be impossible to
show that the requested additional height and bulk of the building are necessary to make the five rent-
restricted units affordable, given such expensive design choices were made for the building,

Lastly, the fact that the applicant has proposed to voluntarily restrict rents on five additional units to make them affordable to moderate-income households constitutes an admission that the project will
have surplus revenue beyond what is necessary to maintain affordability on the five very-low income
units. Moderate-income rental units do not qualify for a density bonus under state law or the City's
ordinance, and consequently the proposed project conditions do not require them to be deed restricted.
They are purely voluntary and do not trigger any legal right to a concession or incentive. However
beneficial and laudable these moderate-income units may be, the applicant's willingness to voluntarily
reduce rents to moderate-income levels on five units means that the financial proforma must have
additional "fat" beyond that needed to support very-low income rents on the density bonus units.

This case, as currently presented, exemplifles the dangerous precedent that would be created where
the financial justification requirement Is ignored. As defined in state law, a "concession or Incentive"
must (I) reduce costs; and (1l) be necessary to provide for the deed-restricted rents. Failure by the City
to enforce those criterla opens the barn door wide to virtually unlimited height and buik. if you could
approve 75' and seven storles in a zone that allows only 45', what would prevent the next developer
from proposing 95° and nine stories? To take it to the extreme, what would prevent approval of a building design on this site with 54 units built with only one unit per floor, to a height of 540 feet?
Please let me know what would prevent this under the applicant's skewed Interpretation of what
quallfles as an aff-menu incentive.

Given that the financial analysis -- which by law must the central focus of your decision -- has not been
included in the agenda material and has not been given to the public in advance with adequate time for
review, the applicant and City staff have therefore not met the state law and City ordinance requirements, and have not provided basic due process for even bringing this matter forward for your consideration. Any approval of the requested concessions and incentives at this week's hearing will be
utterly without foundation and therefore void.

2. THE REQUESTED INCENTIVES AND CONCESSIONS WILL HAVE SPECIFIC ADVERSE IMPACTS
UPON PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY AND THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

A second and independent basis for denying the requested concessions and incentives is that they will
"will have a Specific Adverse Impact upon public health and safety or the physical environment or on
any [registered historic resource]." (LAMC 12.22 A.25(g)(3)i)c., incorporating by reference
Subparagraph (g)(2)(i)c.)

As defined in the LAMC, a "Specific Adverse Impact" means: "a significant, quantifiable, direct, and
unavoidable impact, based on objective, identified written public health or safety standards, policies, or
conditions as they existed on the date the application was deemed complete." (LAMC 12.22 A.25(b).)

3

Two of the most obvious objective, written health and safety standards and policies that will be violated
by this project with resulting direct impact on my clients will be: (i) the neighborhood protection policies of the Wilshire Community Plan; and (Ii) the transitional height rules in the Zoning Ordinance designed
to protect adjacent R1 neighborhoods.

As part of the City's General Plan, the Wilshire Community Plan establishes goals, objectives and policies specifically tailored to the needs of this portion of the City. One of the "three fundamental premises" of
the Community plan with respect to residential development is as follows: "A general limitation of
residential densities in various neighborhoods to the prevailing existing density of development within
these neighborhoods." (Community Plan, p. III-1.) With respect to residential development, the Plan establishes a wide range of housing densities for specific parcels and neighborhoods. Policy 1-1.1 of the
Community Plan specifically provides: "Protect existing stable single family and low density resldential
neighborhoods from encroachment by higher density residential uses and other uses that are
incompatible as to scale and character, or would otherwise diminish quality of life."

Consistent with the Community Plan policies for protection of low-density neighborhoods, the Zoning
Ordinance (LAMC 12.21.1 A) establishes a specific transitional height standard applicable to
developments in a C or M zone abutting an R1 zone or other low-density neighborhood, as follows:

Distance from R1 Zone t Height Limit
0 to 49 feet 25 feet
50 to 99 feet 33 feet
100 to 199 feet 61 feet

The subject property is located in a "C" zone and is located only 20 feet from the R1 zone where my
clients reside. Almost all of the proposed seven-story building lies within 100 feet of the R1 Zone, and
would therefore be limited to at most 33-feet tall under the transitional height standard. The current
agenda report presents a misleading picture of the transitional height requirement in Figure 4, which | have marked up to show the transitional height limit (red) and the 45' 1VL height district limit (blue): •*.'....

LnM 0
ES

Figure 4. Transitional Height Diagram

Nothing in the lengthy agenda report suggests that the project, likely even with 54 units, could not be built within the transitional height envelope (or something close to it) through a combination of design changes that could include, among others, reduction in unit sizes, elimination of the ground floor retail space, and lowering the 15' ceiling height of the ground floor to match the standard 10' heights of the floors above.

The chief goal and essence of good zoning and planning is to regulate the size, height and location of uses so as to promote the harmonious interaction of uses and minimize adverse environmental impacts,
As Justice Sutherland observed in the most famous and seminal zoning case of all time, Village of Euclid
v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U.S. 365 (1926), the fundamental legal justification for zoning laws is the
protection of neighboring properties:
"No serious difference of opinion exists in respect of the validity of laws and regulations fixing the height of buildings within reasonable limits, the character of materials and methods of construction, and the adjoining area which must be left open in order to minimize the danger of fire or collapse, the evils of over-crowding, and the like, and excluding from residential sections offensive trades, industries, and structures likely to create nuisances." (272 U.S. at 388,
emphasis added.)

The proposed project exceeds (by-more-than-100%-in-the-33' transitional zone)-the transitional-heigh t -.........._. standards, and it encroaches upon the protected R1 airspace in violation of the Community Plan goals.
This constitutes a Specific Adverse Impact which deprives my clients and their neighbors of their privacy, light, air and quiet enjoyment of their property. This impact cannot be satisfactorily mitigated by limiting hours for the roof terrace, or by the minor terracing back of upper floors as shown in Figure 4, which eliminates less than a third of the total building mass above the applicable zoning limits. As the
agenda report acknowledges (p. A-9), although there are other tall buildings in the general vicinity, most
notably the Goodson Cedar Sinai medical office tower, "the project site is relatively unique in its proximity to single-family uses." Indeed, the proposed project is only half the distance from my client's residence as the Goodson tower, and there is a substantial difference in terms of loss of privacy
between having your back yard and bedroom overlooked on the one hand, by a primarily daytime use such as a medical office building, and, on the other hand, an apartment tower with balconies and
evening activities going on day and night.

These conditions clearly establish a Significant Adverse Impact that supports denial of the proposed
concessions and incentives.

3. A CLASS 32 CEQA EXEMPTION IS NOT APPLICABLE TO THIS PROJECT

For CEQA clearance, the project is relying on a Class 32 categorical exemption applicable to certain urban infill projects. No Class 32 exemption or other CEQA exemption applies to this case, however,
because, among other things:
a) The Class 32 exemption applies only if the project is consistent with "all applicable general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and regulations." (State CEQA Guidelines 515332(a).) As discussed above, the project is not consistent with the neighborhood protection provisions of the Wilshire Community Plan and with several height, F.A.R., setback and parking
standards of the Zoning Ordinance,
b) Another requirement for use of the Class 32 exemption is that the subject property be "substantially surrounded by urban uses". (State CEQA Guidelines 515332(b).) In this case, the

site is substantially surrounded by one and two-story single-family detached homes to the NE,
East, SE and West (at the corner of N. Hamilton and San Vicente) characteristic of a low density
suburban community.

c) A Class 32 exemption or other categorical exemption may not be used where there is a
reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to
unusual circumstances. (State CEQA Guidelines §15300.2.) Unusual circumstances exist "where
the circumstances of a particular project (i) differ from the general circumstances of the projects covered by a particularized categorical exemption, and (ii) those circumstances create an environmental risk that does not exist for the general class of exempt projects." (Azusa Land Reclamation Co, v. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermäster (52 Cal.App.4t 1165, 1207.) As discussed above, the project is uniquely situated abutting an R1 neighborhood and uniquely out
of proportion with the general plan and zoning limits (e.g. more than twice the 33' transitional
height limit and more than twice the 1.5 F.A.R. limit), and these extreme circumstances create a
Specific Adverse Impact on my clients and their neighbors.

For all the foregoing reasons, the proposed density bonus concessions and incentives should be denied,
and the Commission should make appropriate denial findings incorporating the content of this letter, citing the project's Specific Adverse Impacts, the unlawful nature of the requested concessions or -incentives, the lack of any information concerning cost reduction or-necessity-for the concessions, and....
the need for additional CEQA review.

Mediation is particularly effective when the parties have a continuing relationship, like

R neighbors or business people. Mediation is also very effective where personal feelings are getting in the way of a resolution. This is because mediation normally gives the parties a chance to express their feelings and find out how the other sees things.

Mediation may not be effective when one party is unwilling to cooperate or compromise or when one of the parties has a significant advantage in power over the other. Therefore, it may not be a good choice if the parties have a history of abuse or victimization.

Arbitration

In arbitration, a neutral person called an "arbitrator" hears arguments and evidence from each
side and then decides the outcome of the dispute. Arbitration is typically less formal than trial, and the rules of evidence may be relaxed. Arbitration may be either "binding" or "non-
binding." Binding arbitration means the parties waive their right to a trial and agree to accept
the arbitrator's decision as final. Non-binding arbitration means that the parties are free to a request a trial if they reject the arbitrator's decision.
Arbitration is best for cases where the parties want another person to decide the outcome of
their dispute for them but would like to avoid the formality, time, and expense of a trial. It may also be appropriate for complex matters where the parties want a decision-maker who has training or experience in the subject matter of the dispute.

»-MandatorySettlement-Conference-(MSC)-

Settlement Conferences are appropriate in any case where settlement is an option.
Mandatory Settlement Conferences are ordered by the Court and are often held near the date
a case is set for trial. The parties and their attorneys meet with a judge who devotes his or her ;

time exclusively to preside over the MSC. The judge does not make a decision in the case but
assists the parties in evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the case and in negotiating a
settlement.

The Los Angeles Superior Court Mandatory Settlement Conference (MSC) program is free of is
charge and staffed by experienced sitting civil judges who devote their time exclusively to
presiding over MSCs. The judges participating in the judicial MSC program and their locations are identified in the List of Settlement Officers found on the Los Angeles Superior Court website at http://www.lacourt.org/This program is available in general jurisdiction cases with
represented parties from independent calendar (IC) and Central Civil West (CCW) courtrooms. In addition, on an ad hoc basis, personal Injury cases may be referred to the program on the
eve of trial by the personal injury master calendar courts in the Stanley Mosk Courthouse or the
asbestos calendar court in CCW.

In order to access the Los Angeles Superior Court MSC Program the judge in the IC courtroom,
the CCW Courtroom or the personal injury master calendar courtroom must refer the parties to
the program. Further, all parties must complete the information requested in the Settlement
Conference Intake Form and email the completed form to mscdept18@lacourt.org.
