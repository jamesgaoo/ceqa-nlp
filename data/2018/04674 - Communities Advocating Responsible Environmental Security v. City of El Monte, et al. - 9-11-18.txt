VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

H INTRODUCTION

2 1. This action challenges and seeks to enjoin the actions of City of El Monte ("City"), City

3 of El Monte City Council ("City Council") and the City of El Monte Planning Division ("Planning" or

4 collectively with City and City Council as "Respondents") on July 19, 2018, approving the Conditional

5 Use Permit No. 03-18, Design Review No. 01-18, and Modification No. 02-18 to allow for the

6 demolition of the existing structures and the construction of an industrial logistics development

7 consisting of two buildings with a total floor area of 1,235,340 sq. ft. and 876 parking stalls on the 55.7-

8 acre site at 10150 Lower Azusa Road in the City of El Monte ("Project"). The Project Name is
"Goodman Logistics" or "Goodman Logistics Center." On the same day, the City also approved the

0 Addendum to the 2011 El Monte General Plan and Zoning Code Update Environmental Impact Report

10 as the environmental documentation for the Project.

11 2. In addition, on July 25, 2018, the City approved Development Agreement No. 01-18 for

12 the Project.
3.
13 In approving the Project, the City violated the California Environmental Quality Act

14 ("CEQA"), Cal. Public Resources Code ("PRC") §§ 21000, et seq ("CEQA").
PARTIES

19 noise and other impacts of the Project.
5.
20 Defendant and Respondent City of El Monte ("City") is a California general law a city

21 located in the County of Los Angeles, California. The Project is within the jurisdictional limits of the

22 City. The City acted as the lead agency for the Project.

8 11. JURISDICTION AND VENUE
Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and section 1085 and

9

10 Public Resources Code sections 21168, 21168.5 and 21168.9, this Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ a
of mandate to set aside Respondents' decision to approve the Project's addendum to the previously

11 certified City of El Monte's General Plan and Zoning Code Update Final Program Environmental

12 Impact Report (hereinafter, Final Program EIR or "FPEIR") and purported approval of the Project.
12.
13 Venue is proper in this Court because the Project lies entirely within the County of Los

14 Angeles and the environmental impacts of the Project will be acutely felt in this County. The cause

15 alleged in this Petition, or some part of that cause, arise in this county. (Code Civ. Proc. ("CCP") § 393;

16 Cal. State Parks Foundation v. Super. Ct. (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 826.) Venue is also proper in this

17 Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 394 (actions against city, county or local agency)
and 395 (actions generally), since the City of Los Angeles is in the County of Los Angeles.

18 13. The petition initiating this action was timely filed within 30 days after Respondent's

19 decision to issue a Notice of Determination in accordance with Public Resources Code sections

20 21167(a).

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

17. Petitioners have elected to prepare the record of proceedings in this matter pursuant to

2 PRC section 21167.6(b)(2) and have filed notice of their intent to prepare said record of proceedings. A

3 true and correct copy of the notice is attached to this pleading as Exhibit D.
18. Petitioners performed all conditions precedent to filing this instant action and exhausted
4 administrative remedies to the extent required by law under Public Resources Code section 21177.
5 Petitioners and/or other agencies and individuals raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in the
6 petition orally or in writing during the Respondents' decision-making process.

7 19. The violations by Respondents alleged herein have affected the beneficial interests of

8 Petitioners and/or their supporting members. The relief sought by way of this Petition will redress these

9 beneficial interests and the likelihood of future injury and interference with Petitioners' interests, and

10 those of their supporting members.
20.
11 Petitioners have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy under ordinary law unless this

12 Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside the certification of the
Project and supporting environmental documents. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents'
13 decisions will remain in effect in violation of state law and injurious to Petitioners.
14 STATUTORY FRAMEWORK

15 California Environmental Quality Act

16 21. CEQA requires state and local agencies to identify the potentially significant

17 environmental impacts of their actions, and then to avoid or mitigate those impacts if feasible.

18 22. CEQA requires that an agency analyze the potential environmental impacts of its

19 proposed actions in an environmental impact report (except in certain limited circumstances). (See, e.g.,

20 PRC § 21100, et seq. The EIR is the very heart of CEQA. Dunn-Edwards v. BAAQMD (1992) 9

21 Cal.App.4th 644, 652.) "The 'foremost principle' in interpreting CEQA is that the Legislature intended
the act to be read SO as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable
22 scope of the statutory language." (Cmtys. for a Better Env't v. Cal. Resources Agency (2002) 103
23 Cal.App.4th 98, 109.)

24 23. CEQA has two primary purposes. First, CEQA is designed to inform decision makers and

25 the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of a project. (14 Cal. Code Reg.

26 (*CEQA Guidelines") § 15002(a)(1).) "Its purpose is to inform the public and its responsible officials of

27 the environmental consequences of their decisions before they are made. Thus, the EIR 'protects not

28 only the environment but also informed self-government." (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of
Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564). The EIR has been described as "an environmental 'alarm bell'
-4-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- whose purpose it is to alert the public and its responsible officials to environmental changes before they

2 have reached ecological points of no return." (Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay v. Bd. of Port Comrs.

3 (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1354 ("Berkeley Jets").)
24.
4 Second, CEQA requires public agencies to avoid or reduce environmental damage when

5 "feasible" by requiring "environmentally superior" alternatives and all feasible mitigation measures. (14

6 CCR 15002(a)(2) and (3); Citizens of Goleta Valley, supra, 52 Cal.3d at 564.) The EIR serves to

7 provide agencies and the public with information about the environmental impacts of a proposed project

8 and to "identify ways that environmental damage can be avoided or significantly reduced." (CEQA

9 Guidelines 15002(a)(2).). If a project has a significant effect on the environment, the agency may

10 approve the project only if it finds that it has "eliminated or substantially lessened all significant effects
on the environment where feasible" and that any significant unavoidable effects on the environment are

11 "acceptable due to overriding concerns." (PRC § 21082; see also CEQA Guidelines § 15092(b)(2)(A) &
(B)).
12 25.
13 A program EIR is to be used for "general criteria to govern the conduct of an ongoing

14 program" (CEQA Guidelines § 15168(a)(3).) "A program EIR will be most helpful in dealing with

15 subsequent activities if it deals with the effects of the program as specifically and comprehensively as

16 possible. With a good and detailed analysis…no further environmental documents would be required."

17 (CEQA Guidelines § 15168(c)(5).) In determining whether additional, project-specific CEQA review is

18 required, the agency must determine whether the "effects were fully analyzed in the program EIR." (Id.
at Discussion). If changes in the later project or new information show any new significant

19 environmental effects or increase the severity of environmental effects identified in the program EIR,

20 the agency must prepare an additional CEQA analysis. (PRC § 21166; CEQA Guidelines § 15162.) §
26.
21 "An EIR is required for site specific project within the larger program if the project may

22 cause significant effects.' (American Canyon Community v. City of American Canyon (2006) 145

23 Cal.App.4th 1062, 1073.) Thus, numerous courts require supplemental CEQA review where a prior

24 EIR fails to analyze significant changes in a future project or where there are previously unanalyzed

25 or increased significant impacts. (Concerned Citizens of Costa Mesa, Inc. V. 32nd District Agricultural

26 Association (1986) 42 Cal.3d 929, 934 (public entity violated CEQA when it failed to prepare a

27 Supplemental EIR for significant project changes and new information); American Canyon, 145
Cal.App.4th at 1073 (increase in size and project changes is substantial change triggering subsequent

28 environmental review)).
27. An addendum to an EIR is inappropriate where the lead agency determines, on the basis
-5-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

P of substantial evidence in the light of the whole record, that substantial changes proposed in the project,

2 substantial changes to the circumstances underlying the project, or new information of substantial

3 importance that was previously unknown would result in new significant environmental effects or a

4 substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant effects. (CEQA Guidelines § §
15162(a)(1)-(3), 15164(a)).
5 28.

6 A project's CEQA review must assess "the whole of an action" to ensure that all of the

7 project's environmental impacts are considered. (CEQA Guidelines § 15378; § see also City of Santee v.

8 County of San Diego (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1438, 1454; San Joaquin Raptor/Wildlife Rescue Center V.

9 Cnty. Of Stanislaus (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 713, 730 (held use of "truncated project concept" violated
CEQA where EIR was otherwise adequate)). CEQA mandates "that environmental considerations do not

10 become submerged by chopping a large project into many little ones - each with a minimal

11 potential impact on the environment - which cumulatively may have disastrous consequences." (Bozung

12 V. LAFCO (1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 283-284; see also City of Santee, 214 Cal.App.3d at 1452.)
29.
13 Finally, CEQA requires public agencies to consider the environmental effects of a Project

14 prior to approving a Project as part of a public agency's decision-making process. Section 21002.1(d) of

15 the Cal. Public Resources Code requires a public agency to "consider[] the effects, both individual and
collective, of all activities involved in a project."

16 30. CEQA requires a that a public agency consider the environmental effects of a Project 17 concurrently with the public agency's decision as to whether to approve or disapprove a specific project.

18 Section 21003(a) of the Cal. Public Resources Code specifically requires that [I]ocal agencies integrate

19 the requirements of this division with planning and environmental review procedures otherwise required

20 by law or by local practice sO that all those procedures, to the maximum feasible extent, run

21 concurrently, rather than consecutively.
31.
22 Consistent with the mandate that the CEQA process runs concurrently with a public

23 agency's decision as to whether to approve or disapprove a specific project, CEQA requires that a public

24 agency considers a project's environmental impacts when "determining whether to approve the project"
CEQA Guidelines § 15093(a).

25 32.

26 A project is approved for the purposes of CEQA when a public agency commits "to a
definite course of action .. . [including an] entitlement for use of the project." (CEQA Guidelines

27 15352).

28 33. A CEQA determination cannot be finalized prior to approval of a project. (Cty. of
Amador V. El Dorado Cty. Water Agency, 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 965 (1999) (citing CEQA Guidelines con
-6-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- 15352(a)); Coalition for Clean Air v. City of Visalia (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 408, 423.)

2 34. Similarly, a CEQA determination cannot be adopted after a project has been approved.

3 (Save Tara v. City of West Hollywood (2008) 45 Cal. 4th 116, 127, 132 (finding that subsequent

4 "preparation and certification of an EIR" does not render a lawsuit moot and that "an agency has no

5 discretion to define approval so a as to make its commitment to a project precede the required preparation
of an EIR.")).

6 35.

7 On the same token, "[t]he decision making body shall consider the addendum with the

8 final EIR or adopted negative declaration prior to making a decision on the project." (CEQA Guidelines
15165(d).)

9 36. CEQA requires that public agency allow the public to appeal a CEQA determination to a

10 public "agency's elected decision making body." (PRC § 21151(c)). A CEQA determination and project

11 approval is not "final" until "the final adjudicatory administrative decision." (Hensler v. City of

12 Glendale (1994) 8 Cal. 4th 1, 22).
37.
13 The required CEQA environmental review involves both substantive and procedural

14 steps. Public participation plays an important and protected role in the CEQA process. (Laurel Heights

15 Improvement Association v. Regents of the University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392 ("The

16 EIR process protects not only the environment but also informed self government."); Concerned

17 Citizens of Costa Mesa, Inc. v. 32nd istrict Agricultural Association (1986) 42 Cal.3d 929, 936

18 (members of the public have a "privileged position" in the CEQA process)), "Each public agency should
include provisions in its CEQA procedures for wide public involvement, formal and informal, consistent

19 with its existing activities and procedures, in order to receive and evaluate public reactions to

20 I environmental issues related to the agency's activities." (CEQA Guidelines § 15201). The lead agency

21 must consider all "comments it receives on a draft environmental impact report, proposed negative

22 declaration, or proposed mitigated declaration." (PRC § 21091(d)(1); CEQA Guidelines § 15074(b)).
38.

23 Procedurally, a lead agency may not approve a project until the public has been given a

24 full and adequate opportunity to participate and comment on the project.
39.

25 CEQA also disallows approval of a project that fails to comply with other laws. A lead
agency may not approve a project with significant unavoidable impacts unless it is "otherwise

26 permissible under applicable laws and regulations."(PRC § 21002.1(c).)

27 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL

28 40. This proceeding involves enforcement of important rights affecting the public interest.
Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition a will confer a substantial benefit on the public, including
-7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- citizens, residents, businesses and taxpayers of the City, and will result in the enforcement of important

2 public rights by requiring Respondents to comply with CEQA and other legal requirements applicable to

3 the proposed Project; by voiding the Project approvals and prohibiting Respondents and Real Parties in

4 Interest from taking further actions with respect to the Project until it has complied with those legal

5 requirements; and by prohibiting the Respondents from undertaking any portion of the Project until they
have fully complied with these legal requirements

6 41.

7 Petitioners are entitled to recover attorneys' fees as provided in Code of Civil Procedure

8 section 1021.5 if they prevail in this action. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement of these

9 public rights entitle Petitioners to an awarc of reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to that section.
STATEMENT OF FACTS

10 42. In June of 2011, the City adopted an updated General Plan, certified a FPEIR, adopted a

11 Statement of Overriding Considerations and other related findings.
43.
12 On January 23, 2018, Real Party submitted applications to the City to redevelop the

13 Project Site (*Project Applications"). The Real Party applied for a Conditional Use Permit No. 03-18,

14 Design Review No. 01-18, Modification No. 02-18, and Development Agreement No. 01-18 to demolish

15 all on-site features including approximately 1,036,371 sq. ft. of building space and other site

16 improvements and construct two (2) new state-of-the-art logistics buildings with approximately

17 1,235,340 sq. ft. of building space and other site improvements on a 55.7-acre site. In addition, Real

18 Party has separately applied for a lot line adjustment, which is an administrative action, to adjust the
parcel lines to reconfigure the three (3) existing legal parcels which comprise the Project Site into three

19 (3) legal parcels. The Project is named "Goodman Logistics" or "Goodman Logistics Center."
44.
20 The Project Site is located at 10150 Lower Azusa Road in the City of El Monte and is

21 located at the southeast corner of Shirley Avenue and Lower Azusa Road. The Project Site is bound to

22 the east by existing light industrial, commercial, and school uses, and is bound to the south by the Union
Pacific Railroad rail tracks.

23 45.

24 In June of 2018, the City released a combined Initial Study / Addendum to the City of El
Monte General Plan and Zoning Code Update Final Program EIR (State Clearing House No.
25 2008071012) on the Project ("Addendum").

26 46.

27 In 2011, the City prepared an update to its General Plan and Zoning Code. In compliance
with CEQA, the City, acting as Lead Agency under CEQA, prepared and certified the Final Program

28 EIR. The Final Program EIR evaluated the potential environmental impacts associated with the update
of the El Monte General Plan Elements, Land Use Map, Zoning Code, and ultimate buildout of the City.
-8-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

47. In lieu of preparing an EIR for the Project, the City opted to prepare the Addendum to the

2 2011 FPEIR on the basis that the Project would not cause any new or more severe environmental effects
beyond those already disclosed in the FPEIR.
3 48. The Addendum for the Project was released on June 1, 2018.
4 49. On June 14, 2018, the City's Planning Commission conducted a public hearing on the
5 Project. After hearing public comments on this Project, the Planning Commission voted to continue the

6 public hearing on the Project to June 26, 2018.

7 50. On June 26, 2018, the Planning Commission conducted the continued public hearing on

8 the Project and approved the Project, including Conditional Use Permit No. 03-18, Design Review No.

9 01-18, Modification No. 02-18. The Planning Commission took additional actions in recommending the

10 City Council approve (1) Development Agreement No. 01-18 and (2) the Addendum to the City's 2011

11 FPEIR. (*Planning Commission's June 26, 2018 Decision").
51.
12 On July 3, 2018, Mr. Blackburn, Mr. Montenegro and unincorporated association
CARES appealed the June 26, 2018 Decision to the City Council in its entirety including Conditional
13 Use Permit No. 03-18, Design Review No. 01-18, Modification No. 02-18.
14 52. The City Council was initially scheduled to conduct a public hearing to consider (1) the
15 introduction and first reading of Development Agreement No. 01-18 and (2) a resolution approving the

16 Addendum to the 2011 FPEIR, on July 3, 2018. However, as a result of Petitioners' appeal of the

17 Planning Commission's June 26, 2018 Decision, the City Council continued the July 3, 2018 public

18 a hearing to a Special Meeting date of July 19, 2018.
53.
19 On July 19, 2018, the City Council conducted a public hearing and approved the Project

20 and denied Petitioners' appeal of the Planning Commission's June 26, 2018 Decision, upholding the
Planning Commission's June 26, 2018 Decision which included Conditional Use Permit No. 03-18,
21 Design Review No. 01-18, Modification No. 02-18. In addition, the City Council approved (1) the
22 introduction and first reading of Development Agreement No. 01-18, and (2) a resolution approving the
23 Addendum to the 2011 FPEIR.

24 54. On July 25, 2018, the City a Council held a public hearing and approved a second reading

25 of Development Agreement No. 01-18, which concluded the Project's approval process.

26 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

27 (Violations of CEQA; Addendum Does Not Comply with CEQA)
55.
28 Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate all the above paragraphs as if fully set forth
herein.

-9-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

P 56. CEQA requires the lead agency for a project to prepare an EIR that complies with the

2 requirements of the statute. The lead agency also must provide for public review and comment on the

3 project and associated environmental documentation. An EIR must provide an adequate project

4 description and sufficient environmental analysis such that decision-makers can intelligently consider

5 environmental consequences when acting on the proposed project.
57.

6 A program EIR is to be used for general criteria to govern the conduct of an ongoing

7 program. However, an EIR is required for a site specific project within the larger program if the project
may cause significant effects not analyzed in the program EIR.

8 58.

9 CEQA requires that a lead agency provide an explanation of the decision not to prepare a

10 subsequent EIR in an addendum to an EIR, the lead agency's findings on the project, or elsewhere in the
record. The explanation must be supported by substantial evidence.

11 59. An addendum to an EIR is inappropriate where the lead agency determines, on the basis

12 of substantial evidence in the light of the whole record, that substantial changes proposed in the project,

13 substantial changes to the circumstances underlying the project, or new information of substantial

14 importance that was previously unknown would result in new significant environmental effects or a

15 substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant effects.
60.

16 Respondents violated CEQA by adopting an Addendum to the 2011 FPEIR alongside a

17 Statement of Overriding Considerations that disclosed new information of new significant

18 environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant effects
that were not previously disclosed in the 2011 FPEIR. Moreover, there were substantial changes to the

19 Project and circumstances underlying the Project that similarly require the adoption of a subsequent

20 environmental impact report or negative declaration rather than an addendum.
61.
21 Respondents violated CEQA by approving the Addendum to 2011 FPEIR that fails to

22 adequately analyze and mitigate the Project's potentially significant environmental impacts, including
but not limited to:

23 a.

24 Failure to provide an accurate project description, including whether the Project

25 b. Site could be used as a cold storage warehouse or e-commerce fulfillment center.

26 Failure to assess "the whole of the action" to ensure that all of the Project's

27 environmental impacts are considered, including any future projects contemplated
on the east of the Project Site.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

C. Failure to adequately analyze and mitigate the Project's significant traffic impacts
from, among other things, the potential use of Project Site as a cold-storage 2
warehouse or an e-commerce fulfillment center and the truck queuing. 3 d. Failure to adequately analyze and mitigate the Project's significant air quality
† 4o impacts from, among other things, the potential use of Project Site as a cold-

storage warehouse or an e-commerce fulfillment center and incorrect application
of localized significance thresholds.

7 e. Failure to adequately analyze the Project's significant noise impacts from, among

8 other things, the increase in traffic impacts from the potential use of Project Site

9 as a cold-storage warehouse or an e-commerce fulfillment center and flawed
analysis of construction related noise. 10 f. Failure to adequately analyze and mitigate the Project's significant GHG and 11 climate change impacts by among other things, underestimating emissions and
12 failure by the City to prepare a CAP within two years after the adoption of the
13 General Plan Update.
14 g. Adoption of vague, unenforceable and deferred mitigation measures, including
15 but not limited to Condition of Approvals ("COA") 5.12-1, 7, 15.12-2, 15.12-3,

16 and 15.12-4.

17 h. Failure to adopt all feasible mitigation measures to mitigate the Project's

18 significant environmental impacts to less than significant levels.
62. As a result of the foregoing defects and others according to proof, Respondents 19 prejudicially abused their discretion by approving an addendum to the 2011 FPEIR that does not comply 20 with CEQA, failing to prepare an EIR and by approving the Project in reliance thereon. Accordingly,
21 Respondents' approval of the Addendum to the 2011 FPEIR and purported approval of the Project must
22 be set aside.

23 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

24 (Violations of CEQA; Failure to Substantially Support Factual Findings and Overriding
Considerations) 25

26 63. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate all the above paragraphs as if fully set forth

herein.
27

28

-11-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

64. CEQA requires that a lead agency's findings for the approval of a project be supported by

2 substantial evidence in the administrative record. CEQA further requires that a lead agency provide an

3 explanation of how evidence in the record supports the conclusions it has reached.
65. Respondents violated CEQA by readopting related 2011 FPEIR Findings of Fact and a
4 Statement of Overriding Considerations that are inadequate as a matter of law as they are not supported
5 by substantial evidence in the record, including but not limited to the following:

6 a. The determinations that certain environmental impacts would be less than

7 significant or that adopted mitigation measures would avoid or lessen the

8 Project's significant effects on the environment.

9 b. The determinations that alternatives to the Project and proposed mitigation

10 measures that would have avoided or lessened the significant impacts of the

11 Project were infeasible, including but not limited to the no-Project alternative and
the other alternatives examined in the EIR; and
12
C. The determinations that other environmental impact were significant and
13 unavoidable and had been mitigated to the extent feasible.
14 66. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by

15 making determinations or adopting findings and a Statement of Overriding Considerations that do not

16 comply with the requirements of CEQA and approving the Project in reliance thereon. Accordingly,

17 Respondents' approval of the Addendum to the 2011 FPEIR and purported approval of the Project must

18 be set aside.

19 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

20 (Violations of CEQA; Failure to Complete and/or Enforce Prior Mitigation Conditions)
67. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate all the above paragraphs as if fully set forth
21 herein.
22 68. Where a public agency has adopted mitigation measures for a project, it is required to
23 make mitigation measures legally enforceable to assure they remain in effect.

24 69. In the 2011 FPEIR, the City adopted various mitigation measures intended to mitigate the

25 environmental impacts analyzed in the FPEIR regarding the City's General Plan and Zoning Code

26 Update.

27 70. As of the time of the Project approvals, the mitigation measures contained in the FPEIR

28 were not completed and/or enforced.
71. Mitigation Measure 5-1 of the FPEIR required the one of the mitigation measures
-12-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- incorporated in the FPEIR required the City to adopt a Climate Action Plan ("CAP") within two years

2 after adoption of the City's General Plan and Zoning Code Update, which was adopted in 2011.
72. Mitigation Measure 5-2 of the FPEIR requires the implementation of numerous
3 greenhouse gas mitigations on individual new developments prior to adoption of the Climate Action
4 Plan.

5 73. Mitigation Measure 5-3 of the FPEIR required that new developments be evaluated for

6 consistency with the development pattern set forth in the Southern California Association of

7 Governments Sustainable Communities Strategies plan.

8 74. The City did not comply with any of these aforementioned mitigation measures, having

9 yet to adopt a CAP, require or consider all mitigation measures listed in Mitigation Measure 5-1 of the

10 FPEIR that were required for new development pending the City's adoption of the CAP, or make any

11 finding regarding the consistency of the Project with the development patterns set forth in the Southern
California Associations of Governments Sustainable Communities Plan.
12 75. Respondents violated CEQA by failing to complete and/or enforce the mitigation
13 measures contained in the 2011 FPEIR. Consequently, Respondents' approval of the Addendum to the
14 2011 FPEIR and purported approval of the Project must be set aside. Respondents must also be

15 compelled to complete and/or enforce the mitigation measures contained in the 2011 FPEIR, including

16 but not limited to the adoption of a CAP.
PRAYER FOR RELIEF 17

18 WHEREFORE, Petitioner pray for judgment as set forth below:

19 A. For writ of mandate commanding Respondent to vacate and withdraw the approval of

20 the Addendum to the 2011 FPEIR and any purported approvals of the Project, to require Respondents to

21 complete the CEQA environmental review and public comment period as required by law;

22 B. For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent

23 injunctions enjoining Respondents and Real Parties in Interest, and their agents, employees, officers or
24 representatives, and all persons acting in concert or participating with Respondents and Real Parties in

25 Interest from taking any action to implement the Project, unless and until Respondents fully comply with

26 CEQA;

27 C. For a declaration of the rights and duties of the parties hereto, including but not limited to

28 a declaratory judgment that Respondents violated their duties pursuant to CEQA by approving the
