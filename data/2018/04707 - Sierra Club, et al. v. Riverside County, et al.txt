INTRODUCTION

1. On January 6, 2016, Petitioners Sierra Club, Center for Biological Diversity, and
San Bernardino Valley Audubon Society (collectively, "Petitioners") filed a Verified Petition for

4 Writ of Mandate ("Initial Petition") challenging the December 8, 2015 decision of the County of
Riverside and its Board of Supervisors (collectively, "the County") to approve General Plan
6 Amendment Number 960 and the County's Climate Action Plan, and to certify the associated
7 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") (collectively, "GPA 960"). That matter is currently
8 pending before Judge Waters in Department 10. of this Court, Riverside County Superior Court
9 Case No. RIC 1600159.

10 2. Petitioners file this additional Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate (*Petition") in

11 order to challenge Respondents' December 6, 2016 decision to approve General Plan
12 Amendment 1122, which adopts a new Housing Element and amends various portions of the
13 General Plan; adopts Ordinance 348.4840, Change of Zone No. 7902, and Ordinance
14 No. 348.4841; and certifies EIR No. 548 (collectively, "GPA 1122"). This Petition therefore sets
15 forth additional allegations regarding the subsequent actions taken by the County with respect to
16 its General Plan, which relate to but do not supersede the Initial Petition.

17 3. GPA 1122 amends the County's General Plan to plan for 63,000 more units than
18 permitted under GPA 960, including in areas that would constitute "leapfrog" development and
19 that would result in the further conversion of agricultural lands. However, in adopting GPA
20 1122, the County did not correct the legal deficiencies set forth in the Initial Petition. Indeed, the

21 new EIR suffers from the same deficiencies as the EIR challenged in the Initial Petition, and
22 even exacerbates those deficiencies in some instances. Thus, as with GPA 960, Respondents'
23 actions in approving GPA 1122 violated the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"),
24 Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq., and the CEQA Guidelines, Title 14, California
25 Code of Regulations, section 15000 et seq. This additional Petition is necessary to ensure
26 Petitioners receive complete relief with respect to their allegations regarding the County's
27 approvals for, and environmental review of, Riverside's General Plan update process.

10 action and has exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by
11 law.

12 16. Petitioners have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
13 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside their
14 approval of GPA 1122. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' approval will remain in
15 effect in violation of state law.

16 STATEMENT OF FACTS

17 17. In December 2015, the County adopted a comprehensive update to its General
18 Plan. Rather than update the General Plan Housing Element in that process, the County
19 bifurcated the proceedings to prepare its 5th Cycle Housing Element update separately. GPA
20 1122 is the culmination of the Housing Element proceeding, but represents more than the simple
21 adoption of a new Housing Element. Instead, GPA 1122 includes revisions to 10 General Plan
22 Area plans, amendments to multiple land use designations contained in the General Plan Land
23 Use Element, and zoning changes. These land use changes were purportedly necessary to allow
24 future development intended to meet the Regional Housing Needs Assessment allocations to the
25 County pursuant to state law
26 18. The County issued a Notice of Preparation of an EIR to study GPA 1122 on June
27 26, 2015. Given changes to the project, the County issued a revised NOP on October 9, 2015.
28

4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

The Sierra Club provided written comments on the NOP outlining the necessary components of

2 adequate CEQA compliance for the project.

3 19. The County released its Draft EIR ("DEIR") for GPA 1122 on April 14, 2016 for a

4 45-day public comment period. By that time, Petitioners had filed litigation challenging GPA

5 960, alerting the County to the ongoing deficiencies in the County's General Plan and its CEQA
6 compliance. Nevertheless, the DEIR repeated many of the same mistakes identified in GPA 960.
7 The Sierra Club provided extensive comments detailing these concerns.

8 20. The County released its Final EIR ("FEIR") for GPA 1122 in July 2016. Rather

9 than address the serious legal deficiencies raised by the Sierra Club and other commenters, the
10 FEIR contained only minor corrections. Both the Sierra Club and the San Bernardino Valley
11 Audubon Society submitted comments objecting to the FEIR's lack of substantive response and
12 ongoing CEQA violations. Nevertheless, the County quickly moved to Planning Commission
13 review on August 3, 2016, with a continued hearing on October 5, 2016.
14 21. Alarmed by the County's lack of response to prior comments, the Sierra Club
15 submitted additional comments in advance of the Board of Supervisor's consideration of GPA
16 1122. The Center for Biological Diversity also submitted comments. These comments reiterated
17 that the County was continuing to commit the same legal errors challenged in the litigation over
18 GPA 960.

19 22. Specifically, Petitioners identified the following CEQA violations:

20 a. CEQA does not permit the EIR to rely on mid-range development

21 projections, which assume that development will occur at significantly less
22 intensity than actually allowed under GPA 1122. The EIR uses these

23 erroneous assumptions across all environmental impact analyses, grossly
24 understating GPA 1122's potential impacts.

25 b. With respect to air quality, the EIR provides no study of GPA 1122's
26 impacts to public health and no mitigation for these effects. This omission
27 is particularly glaring given that GPA 1122 will both increase sources of

28 toxic air contaminants, exacerbating an existing public health concern, and
5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

authorize extensive new residential development immediately adjacent to
2 high-volume highways and other sources of pollution.

C. The EIR does not adequately analyze impacts to agriculture. Rather than
measure GPA 1122's impacts against the existing environment, it assesses
them against GPA 960; such a plan-to-plan analysis is impermissible under
CEQA. The EIR also fails to evaluate the scope of the Plan's indiréct
impacts to agricultural resources and wholly dismisses the potential for
measures to avoid or mitigate for such impacts.
d. The EIR fails to support its choice of thresholds for analyzing greenhouse
10 gas emissions with substantial evidence. In addition, while recognizing that
11 greenhouse gas pollution impacts are significant and unavoidable, the EIR
12 fails to analyze or require all feasible mitigation measures to address GPA
13 1122's impacts.
14 e. The EIR fails to adequately disclose and analyze the Plan's impacts to
15 biological resources. Specifically, the Plan minimizes and disregards the
16 impacts to sensitive species and habitat from anticipated new development.
17 In violation of CEQA, the EIR improperly relies on Western Riverside
18 County Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan mitigation measures,
19 despite the uncertainty and potential ineffectiveness of many of those
20 tar....-:. : measures.

21 23. Despite comments from Petitioners and others, the Board of Supervisors voted at
22 the public hearing to approve GPA 1122.
23 24. The County filed a Notice of Determination for its December 6, 2016 actions
24 regarding GPA 1122 on or about December 6, 2016.
25 25. Petitioners met and conferred with the County as to whether the Petition should be
26 filed as a supplement a to the Initial Petition or as a new petition. The County requested that the
27 Petitioners file the a Petition as a new matter given that there are new approval documents and in
28 case additional parties file litigation regarding GPA 1122, which would need to be coordinated
6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

with the instant Petition. Petitioners are filing a notice of related case regarding the Initial

2 Petition concurrently herewith,

3 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

4 Violation of CEQA (Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.) §
26. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs,
6 and cach and every allegation in the Initial Petition as if set forth fully herein.
27. Respondents violated CEQA by relying on an EIR for GPA 1122 that is
8 inadequate and fails to comply with the requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines.

9 Among other defects, the GPA 1122 EIR:
10 a) Uses an incomplete and unstable description of the project. In its analysis of all

11 impact categories, the GPA 1122 EIR, like the GPA 960 EIR, assumes that the full
12 amount of development allowed under the General Plan will not materialize. The
13 document thus disregards the potential environmental impacts associated with the

14 development intensities actually allowed by the General Plan.
15 b) Fails to adequately disclose, analyze, or mitigate GPA 1122's significant impacts
16 on the environment, including but not limited to its direct, indirect, and cumulative
17 impacts on biological resources, air quality, public health, climate change, and

18 agriculture.

19 28.: Respondents violated CEQA by failing to adequately respond to comments on the
20 EIR, including, but not limited to, ignoring or rotely dismissing identification of flaws in the

21 County's analysis, requests for additional information, and suggestions of feasible mitigation
22 measures and alternatives.

23 29. Respondents violated CEQA by adopting inadequate findings. The County's
24| findings do not provide adequate reasoning or the analytic route from facts to conclusions, as

25 required by law. The findings and statement of overriding consideration are unsupported by
26 substantial evidence in the record.

27 30. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their
28 discretion by certifying an EIR that does not comply with the requirements of CEQA and
7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

precluded informed decisionmaking. As such, Respondents' certification of the EIR and

2 approval of GPA 1122, as with GPA 960, must be set aside.
PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as follows:
1. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to vacate

6 and set aside GPA 1122;

2. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to comply
with CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, and to take any other action as required by Public
Resources Code section 21168.9;

10 3. For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent
11 injunctions restraining Respondents and their respective agents, servants, and employees, and all
12 others acting in concert with Respondents on their behalf, from taking any action to implement
13 GPA 1122, pending full compliance with the requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines;
14 4. For costs of the suit;

15 5. For attorneys' fees as authorized by Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 and
16 other provisions of law; and

17 6. For such other and future relief as the Court deems just and proper.
