20

21 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

22 10, On information and belief, at all times relevant to this complaint, Respondents City of

23 South EI Monte and its City Manager, Jennifer Vasquez, have refused to enforce the Municipal

24 Code of the City of South El Monte, have acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner, contrary to
established public policy, have failed to follow proper procedures and have, despite many requests,
25 refused to respond to the many pleas by Petitioners/Plaintiffs that South El Monte enforce its codes

26 and abate the nuisance conducted by Lawrence Equipment.

27
11.
28 On information and belief, at all times relevant to this complaint, Defendants Lawrence
and Does 1-25 have used and continue to use the Lawrence Property in a manner that violates the

3 PETITION/COMPLAINT

1 laws of the State of California and the Municipal Code of the City of South El Monte and

2 specifically injures, damages and impairs the rights of Sepulveda and Carrillo to the reasonable use
and enjoyment of their properties. The harmful and injurious activities of Lawrence and the
3 corresponding code violations include those described below.
4

5 12. Noise from the Lawrence factory specifically interferes with the daily conduct of

6 Sepulveda's and Carrillo's lives. The noise often interferes with their sleep, wakes them up early
in the morning and late at night, interferes with their ability to hear music or television in their
homes, interferes with their ability to converse with others outside or to enjoy their yards,
8 interferes with their ability to entertain company at home, shakes their walls and windows, and
9 causes them irritation and stress.

10
13.
11 Attached as Exhibit A and incorporated herein by reference is a true and correct copy of the
South El Monte Noise Regulations. On information and belief, noise and vibration from the
12 Lawrence factory is a violation of these Regulations and is a nuisance per se,
13

14 14. South El Monte Municipal Code Section 8.20.010(F) defines a Noise Disturbance as "any

15 sound which (i) endangers or injures the safety or health of human beings or animals, or (ii)
annoys o disturbs reasonable persons of normal sensitivities, or (iii) endangers or injures personal
16 or real property or (iv) violates the limits set forth in Section 8.20.020." Noise and vibration from
17 the Lawrence factory is a violation of this a Code section.
18

19 15. Operation of the Lawrence factory is a Noise Disturbance under South El Monte Municipal

20 Code Section 8.20.010(F) and, therefore, is a "Prohibited Act" under the South El Monte
Municipal Code and violates Municipal Code Sections 8.20.030(C), (D), (H) and (I).
21

22 16. Vibration from the Lawrence factory is present at the property line and within the

23 Sepulveda and Carrillo properties. Vibration from the Lawrence factory is a violation of South El

24 Monte Municipal Code Section 8.20.020(B), and Section 17.50.030 which requires that all of
Lawrence's machinery be operated "so that no detectable level of vibration is transmitted to other
25 properties..."
26

27 17. The Lawrence factory is also a disturbance of the peace prohibited under Section

28 8.36.015(B) (4) of the South El Monte Municipal Code, which section provides:

4
PETITION/COMPLAINT

L

1 "No person shall willfully disturb the peace or quiet of any neighborhood or person

2 by doing any of the following:
(a) Creating or causing to be created any loud, unnecessary or unusual noises."
3 18. Though located directly next to a residential neighborhood, Lawrence installed metal
4 fencing and barbed wire along property lines it shares with residential neighbors (including
5 Sepulveda and Carrillo) and along Maxson Road, which is a public roadway, such that the fencing

6 and maintenance of the Lawrence property line, is visible to the Neighborhood and creates an ugly

7 and blighted condition. Further contributing to the blight appearance are the Lawrence outdoor

8 scaffolds that rise above the fence-line and are used by Lawrence to store materials and are visible

9 to the Neighborhood. The Lawrence factory constitutes a nuisance because of these substandard

10 and blight conditions of the factory, and further violates Section 8.36.015(B) (7), which prohibits
any "fence, structure ... that is visible from any adjacent property, [or] street, that may
11 detrimentally affect the aesthetic and economic value of the property in the immediate vicinity."
12

13 19. The Lawrence factory violates S. El Monte Code Sections 17.18.030 and 17.18.190, which

14 require that manufacturing must be "entirely within an enclosed building...." The Lawrence

15 factory operations are often conducted outside, and/or within metal buildings with open walls.

16 20. The Lawrence factory violates S, El Monte Code Section 17.50.020 (B), which requires

17 that "Industrial or commercial buildings will maintain a five feet side or rear setback from a

18 multiple residential zone district with no openings other than required fire exits facing the

19 residential property," (Emphasis supplied.) The Lawrence factory operates with openings in the
walls facing the Sepulveda and Carrillo properties.
20

21 21. The Lawrence factory violates S. El Monte Code Section 17.50.030(G), which requires that

22 the Lawrence hours of operation to "be compatible with the needs and character of the surrounding

23 neighborhood." Though located directly adjacent to residential properties, the Lawrence factory
typically operates Monday through Saturday with loud manufacturing starting each day at 6 am.
24 Noise from the Lawrence factory includes, pounding, cutting, dropping, moving, hammering,
25 grinding of metal and the back and forth of the Lawrence forklifts. Manufacturing often continues
26 late into the evening and carly morning. The factory's late night and early morning operations are

27 not compatible with residential use.

28

PETITION/COMPLAINT

1 22. The Lawrence factory's hours of operation also violate the provision of S. El Monte Code

2 Section 17.50.030(G) requiring Planning Commission approval for any operation outside the hours
of six am to ten pm. On information and belief, Lawrence does sometimes operate between 10
3 pm 6 and 6 am and there is no use permit or other Planning Commission approval authorizing the
4 extended hours of factory operation directly adjacent to this residential neighborhood. Nor should
5 there be any such approval given that the factory operates directly adjacent to a long established

6 residential neighborhood and extended hours of operation are not compatible with the adjoining

7 residential uses.

3 23. The Lawrence factory violates South El Monte Code Section 17.50.030(F) by causing
noise and disruption to residential neighbors by continuously operating forklifts and other

10 machinery within a narrow space between Lawrence's metal factory walls and adjoining
residences.
11 24. On information and belief, the Lawrence factory violates S. El Monte Code Section
12 17.18.060 which prohibits a machine shop from operating adjacent to or across the street from a

13 residential zone because the Lawrence factory uses "such operations as deburring, the use of high

14 speed drilling, sawing or cutting of metals; the use of any punch press over twenty tons capacity

15 and the use of brakes or other equipment capable of producing excessive noise or vibration,

16 including drop hammers."

17 25. The Lawrence factory stores materials and other items on high scaffolding that towers over
18 fencing and is visible from homes in the Neighborhood. The Lawrence factory violates South El

19 Monte Code Section 17.18.040 (C) requiring all storage to be located within a fenced and screened

20 area.

21 26. Lawrence installed barbed wire and metal fencing along its property line with residential

22 neighbors and along Maxson Road. The Lawrence factory violates S. El Monte Code Section
17.50.20 requiring an 8 foot tall masonry wall on the property line abutting a residential zone.
23

24 27. The Lawrence factory's barbed wire, metal fencing, outdoor storage and outdoor

25 manufacturing also violates S. El Monte Code Section 17.50.030, which requires that the factory

26 be operated in a manner that will not interfere with residents' enjoyment of their property.

27 28. The Lawrence factory interferes with residential neighbors' enjoyment of their property.

28

6
PETITION/COMPLAINT

-

1 The Lawrence factory violates S. Bl Monte Code Section 17.50.030, which establishes the South

2 El Monte performance standards for industrial and commercial uses next to a residential zone.

3 Among other things, these standards require that the Lawrence factory "be operated in a manner
that will not interfere with the residents' enjoyment of their property."
29,

5 On information and belief, the Lawrence factory violates S. El Monte Code Section

6 17.18.050 requiring a conditional permit for uses proposed for any property in excess of 1 acre and
for any building that is at least 25,000 square feet.

7 30.
8 On information and belief, the Lawrence factory is an unlawful public nuisance under

9 South El Monte Municipal Code Section 8.36.015(A) which defines a prohibited public nuisance

10 as the following: "A public nuisance is any violation of this code or anything ... offensive to the
senses, or an obstruction to the free use of property, so as to interfere with the comfortable

11 enjoyment of life or property by a neighborhood or by a considerable number of persons...."

12
31.
13 On April 26, 2017, the Neighborhood delivered to the City of South El Monte the letter

14 attached hereto as Exhibit B and incorporated herein by reference. The letter set forth and

15 documented numerous violations by Lawrence of the South El Monte Municipal Code and

16 attached letters from Sepulveda and Carrillo detailing the loud noise, stress and nuisance Lawrence
causes. The letter demanded immediate action to abate the nuisance and demanded South El

17 Monte enforce its codes.

18 32.

19 33. On May 3, 2017, the Neighborhood delivered its April 26, 2017 letter to Lawrence.

20 On information and belief, on May 5, 2017, Lawrence, by and through its attorneys, wrote

21 to the City Manager, Code Enforcement Officer and Development Officer of the City of South EI

22 Monte, addressing the letter to each of the them and stating, «Jennifer, Manny and Joe, I received a
copy this week of the attached letter from Save Our Neighborhood ... which alleges certain code

23 violations by Lawrence Equipment's existing operations in South El Monte... Needless to say

24 none of his claims are valid."

25 34.

26 On May 10, May 31, June 2 and June 9, the Neighborhood delivered emails and/or letters
to South El Monte City Manager, Jennifer Vasquez, requesting response to its April 26 letter. On

27 May 31, 2017, a member of the Neighborhood appeared at the South El Monte City Council

28 meeting to reiterate the complaints stated in the Neighborhood's April 26 letter and to complain
that South El Monte allows Lawrence to violate city codes.

7 PETITION/COMPLAINT

I

1 35. Attached as Exhibit C and incorporated herein is a true and correct copy of the June 12, 2017
report of Environmental & Safety Associates measuring noise at the residential property line where the
2 Lawrence factory adjoins the Sepulveda property. During the early morning period sampled, noise from
3 the Lawrence factory averaged 72. dbA, was more than 75 dbA for 20% of the time, more than 80 dbA 4 %

4 of the time and approached 90 dbA at one point. The report concluded that "Lawrence Equipment is in

5 clear violation of ...the South El Monte noise ordinance." This report was provided to the City of South
EI Monte and to Lawrence Equipment.

36. By letter dated August 15, 2017, the Neighborhood wrote to the City of South El Monte reiterating
the complaints documented in its April 26 letter and demanding that the City of South El Monte "take

9 immediate actions to address the code violations listed in our April 26, 2017 letter and abate the public
nuisance caused by operations of the Lawrence Equipment factory in the City of South El Monte."
10

11 36. Attached as Exhibit D and incorporated herein is a true and correct copy of the November

12 9, 2017 report of Gary Floyd and Associates measuring noise at the residential property line where

13 the Lawrence factory adjoins the Sepulveda property. Measurements showed that, on the day

14 measured, between 6 am to 7 am, the peak reading was 98 dbA with more than 100 readings
hitting 75 dbA or more. The report concluded that "Lawrence Equipment is in violation of the
15 South El Monte ordinances in Section 8.20 and in particular Sections 8.20.030 D and H." This

16 report was provided to the City of South El Monte and to Lawrence Equipment.
17

18 37. On November 21, 2017, the Neighborhood wrote to the City of South El Monte and to

19 Lawrence Equipment reiterating complaints listed in earlier letters and demanding cessation of the

20 nuisance and code violations. A copy of this letter without exhibits is attached as Exhibit E and E
incorporated herein.
21

22 38. Except to acknowledge receipt of the Neighborhood's complaint, the City of South El

23 Monte has never responded to the Neighborhood's April 26 letter or to any other letter or request

24 made from the Neighborhood to the City of South El Monte.

25 39. Despite the aforementioned letters and reports, Lawrence's nuisance and code violations

26 continued and still continue unabated.

27

28

8 PETITION/COMPLAINT

1 40. As a matter of law, under Health and Safety Code Section 46000, "All Californians are
environment without the intrusion of noise which may be
2 entitled to a peaceful and quiet
hazardous to their health or welfare."
3
41.
4 As a matter of law, the State of California has declared "excessive noise is a serious
hazard to the public health and welfare." (California Health and Safety Code Section 46000(a))
5 As a further matter of law, noise from the Lawrence factory is "excessive" because it violates noise
standards established by the City of South EI Monte.

42. or
8 California Civil Code Section 3479 provides "Anything which is injurious to health,
offensive to the senses, or an obstruction to the free use of property, so as to interfere with the
9 comfortable enjoyment of life is a nuisance." The Lawrence factory is a nuisance. a
10

11 43. Under California Penal Code Section 415, *Any person who maliciously and willfully

12 disturbs another person by loud and unreasonable noise" is guilty of disturbing the peace. On

13 information and belief, the Lawrence factory daily violates this section and knowingly and

14 intentionally disturbs the peace of its neighbors.

15 44. South El Monte Municipal Code Section 17.80.030 provides, 'No license or permit for a

16 use, building or purpose where the issuance of such license or permit would be in conflict with the

17 zoning ordinance shall be issued. All departments, officials or other employees of the city vested

18 with the authority to issue licenses or permits shall not issue such permits or licenses which would
not be in conformity with the provision of the zoning ordinance, Any license or permit so issued
19 shall be pull and void."
20
45.
21 South El Monte Municipal Code Section 17.80.040 provides, "Any firm, corporation,

22 person or persons violating any of the provisions of this title shall be deemed guilty of a
misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be punishable by a fine not to exceed on thousand
23 dollars or imprisonment for not more than six months or both such fine and imprisonment at the
24 discretion for the court." Section 17.80.050 provides that "each person or persons violating any of

25 the provisions of this title shall be deemed guilty of a separate offence for every day ...."

26 46. On information and belief, the City Manager of South El Monte is under a duty to enforce
27 the laws of the State of California as they pertain to the City and the ordinances of the City of
28 South EI Monte. Pursuant to South El Monte Municipal Code Section 2.08.060, the City

--

Manager "shall be the administrative head of the city government" and "[Ilt shall be the City

2 Manager's duty ... to see that the laws of the State of California pertaining to the City and all laws

3 and ordinances of the City are duly enforced." (Emphasis supplied.)

4 47. On information and belief, neither the City of South El Monte nor the City Manager,

5 Jennifer Vasquez, have duly enforced the laws of the State of California and the ordinances of the

6 City of South El Monte, including but not limited to the ordinances and laws stated above.

24 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
25 Government Code Section 36900 (Violation of City Ordinance)
By Plaintiffs Save Our Neighborhood, Debbie Sepulveda, Adolfo Carrillo 26 Against Defendants Lawrence Equipment, Inc. and Does 1-50
27 56. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference into this cause of action each allegation of paragraphs 1
28 through 55 above.

11 PETITION/COMPLAINT

~0

"The violation of a 1 57. California Government Code Section 36900 provides, in relevant part,

2 city ordinance may be ... redressed by civil action."

3
58. As alleged above, Lawrence has violated and continues to violate city ordinances of the
4 City of South El Monte,
5

6 59. On information and belief, and based upon past experience, unless Defendants are enjoined

7 and restrained from violating the above-listed city ordinances, including but not limited to the
conduct of a nuisance under South El Monte Municipal Code Section 8.36.015(A), Defendants

9 will continue to violate city ordinances and will continue to conduct a nuisance injurious to
Plaintiffs' health and damaging to Plaintiffs' rights to reasonable enjoyment of their homes free
10 from intruding noise.
11

12 60. Such conduct will result in irreparable harm to Plaintiffs, in that so long as the code
violations and nuisance are not abated, Plaintiffs will suffer stress and irritation, and be deprived
13 of the reasonable use of their homes. The threat of such irreparable damage justifies the issuance
14 by this Court of a temporary, preliminary and permanent injunction.
15

16 61. Additionally, Plaintiffs have requested the City of South El Monte enforce its ordinances
and abate the nuisance conducted by Lawrence and the City of South El Monte has refused. The
17 failure of the City of South El Monte to abate code violations and an active nuisance further justify
18 issuance of a temporary, preliminary and permanent injunction.
19
62. As a proximate result of the above-described acts and omissions of Defendants, the 20 individual Plaintiffs have suffered discomfort, annoyance, stress and endured mental suffering.
21 As a result of such injury, these Plaintiffs have sustained damage in an amount to be determined by
22 proof at trial.
23
63. As proximate result of the above-described acts and omissions of Defendants, the 24 individual Plaintiffs have been hurt and injured in their health, strength, and activity, sustaining
25 injury to his body, and shock, anxiety, and injury to his nervous system and person, all of which
26 have caused Plaintiffs great mental, physical, and nervous pain, distress, and suffering. As a result
27 of such injury Plaintiffs have sustained damage in an amount to be determined by proof at trial.

28

12 PETITION/COMPLAINT

1. 64. On information and belief, Defendants' conduct was malicious and oppressive, and

2 therefore Plaintiffs are entitled to punitive damages in an amount according to proof.

3 65. On information and belief, Lawrence has conducted itself and continues to conduct itself in

4 an intentional and malicious manner toward Plaintiffs knowingly and intentionally inflicting harm

5 on Plaintiffs' property rights, quality of life, health and well being. On information and belief,

6 such intentional, depraved and malicious conduct is demonstrated by the following, among other

7 things:

8

9 A. Lawrence knows and has known that noise from its factory exceeds legally allowable
decibel levels, intrudes into the homes and properties of Plaintiffs. Despite such
10 knowledge, Lawrence intentionally continues conduct that violates legal limits and
11 injures and damages Plaintiffs.
12

13 B. Lawrence knows that early morning operations are particularly intrusive and harmful,
but Lawrence operates in early morning anyway. Lawrence knows that its heavy
14 machines cause vibration in adjoining properties, but operates the machines anyway.
15

16 C. Lawrence knows that manufacturing in South El Monte must be done entircly within an

17 enclosed building with no openings facing homes. Despite such knowledge, Lawrence

18 conducts manufacturing with opén walls facing homes with no regard for its violation
of law and impact on Plaintiffs.
19

20 D. Lawrence knows that its metal-sided buildings are substandard for its manufacturing

21 processes which involve heavy machinery and the grinding, pounding and cutting of

22 stainless steel, particularly when located directly adjacent to residential homes.
Despite such knowledge, Lawrence conducts its operations from substandard metal
23 buildings adjacent to residential homes.
24

25 E. Lawrence knows that running its forklifts along the property line it shares with

26 Plaintiffs causes intrusive and constant noise to Plaintiffs. Lawrence runs the forklifts

anyway,
27

28

13
PETITION/COMPLAINT

1 F. Lawrence knew that the mature Deodar Cedar tree at the corner of Chosen and Maxson

2 is a protected Heritage tree and a landmark for the Neighborhood, Despite such
knowledge, Lawrence illegally cut more than 50% of the tree and permanently
3 disfigured the tree,
4

5 G. Lawrence knows that it is unreasonable, illegal and unsightly to run barbed wire along

6 residential back yards, to build metal fencing along residential borders and to store its
materials and other items on high scaffolding that towers over fencing and is visible
from homes in El Monte and that this is detrimental to the Neighborhood. Lawrence
does it anyway.
9

10 H. Lawrence's president, Johnny Lawrence, tried to discredit and bully the Neighborhood

11 by making up a story about one of the Neighborhood's leaders and publishing it in the

12 newspaper. When the Neighborhood opposed Lawrence's application to tear out

13 homes and expand its factory onto Chosen Street, Johnny Lawrence falsely stated in the
newspaper that the Neighborhood's opposition was led by a disgruntled former
14 employee who was "crazy" and "yella" and had to be fired. The story was a lie
15 conceived and told with ill will toward the Neighborhood and its leaders.

16 66. is This action is brought to enforce an important right affecting the public interest such that
17 Petitioners are entitled to recovery of their attorneys" fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
18 Section 1021.5.

B. "Ambient nolse level" means the normal or existing level of environmental noise at given location, not in- cluding the particular noise being measured ox considered,
C. "Decibel" means a unit for measuring the amplttude
of e sound, equal to twenty times the logarithm to the base ten of the ratio of the pressure of the sound measured to a
reference pressure of twenty micropascals. D. "Impulsive sound" means a sound of short duration, usually less than one second, with an abrupt onset and a rapid decay, Examples of sources of impulsive sound include explosions, drop forge impacts, and the discharge of fire-
arms
E. "Intrusive noise" means noise which intrudes over
and above the existing ambient noise at a given location. The relative intrusiveness of a sound depends upon its am- plitude, duration, frequency and time of occurrence, and tonal or information content as well as the prevailing ambi- ent noise level.
F. "Noise disturbance" means any sound which (i) endan- gers or injures the safety or health of human bpeings or animals, or (il) annoys or disturbs reasonable persons of normal sensitivities, or (iii) andangers or injures personal or real property or (iv) violates the limits set forth in Section 8.20,020.

it is a repetitive noise such as a hammering or riveting, or containg music of speech conveying informational content, the exterior noise limits set forth in Tables I and 2 shall be reduced by dbA,
3, IE the measured ambient noise level exceeds that permissible within any of the first four noise limit cat- egories above, the ellowable noise limits set forth in Table or 2 shall be adjusted in dbA increments in each catego- ry as appropriate to encompass or reflect the ambient nose level,In the event the ambient noise level exceeds the fifth noise limit category, the exterior noise limit under the fifth category shall be increased to reflect the maximum ambient noise level,
4. Noise Measurement Procedure, The noise level shall be measured as a position or positions at any point on the receivers property utilizing the A-Weighting scale of the sound leyel meter and the "slow" meter response for non~ impulsive type noises and fast" response for impulsive type sounds. When feasible, the microphone shall be located ap- proximately tour to five feet above the ground and ten feet or more from the nearest reflective surface, In those cases where the standard alevation is not: feasible the most closely approximate elevation possible shall be utilized. Calibration of the measurement equipment, utilizing an acoustical calibrator, shall be performed immediately prior to recording any noise data.

By US Mail and email, jvasquez@soe/monte.org.jmartinez@soelmonte.org Jennifer Vasquez, Interim City Manager Joe Martinez, Code Enforcement Department Supervisor City of South El Monte City Hall
1415 Santa Anita Ave,
South El Monte, CA 91733.

RE: Lawrence Equipment, Inc.
Dear Ms. Vasquez and Mr. Martinez:
This office represents Save Our Neighborhood, an unincorporated association of El Monte residents affected by the operations and proposed expansion of the Lawrence Equipment factory. The Lawrence Equipment factory is in the City of South El Monte. The Lawrence factory is directly adjacent to single family and R-2 zoned residential properties in the City of El
Monte.

We make the following complaint of code violations and of a conduct of a public
nuisance:

l. Noise and vibration

The Lawrence factory produces levels of noise and vibration that are a nuisance to
residents who live in the adjoining El Monte neighborhood. Residents in the Bl Monte neighborhood often endure noise from the Lawrence factory that interferes with the daily conduct of their lives. Noise from the Lawrence factory is at such an extreme level that it interferes with residents' daily lives, with their sleep, their ability to have company at their homes and even their ability to talk with another outside. Residents also experience vibration from the factory machines. Letters attesting to all of these impacts are attached.
Noise and vibration from the Lawrence factory is a violation of the S. El Monte Noise Regulations. The Lawrence factory's operation is a noise disturbance under Sections 8.20.010(F) and 8.20.030(C), (D), (H) and (I). The factory operation violates Section 8.20.020(B) in that vibration from the Lawrence factory is present at the property line and within the adjoining residential properties. The factory also violates Section 17.050.030 which requires that all of Lawrence's machinery be operated "so that no detectable level of vibration is transmitted to other properties...."

2. Manufacuuring done in buildings open to the neighborhood
The Lawrence manufacturing is done in a building that that is open to the residential uses in the City of El Monte. We have attached photos that were taken from the backyards of homes in the City of El Monte. The photos show the open walls and open doors during manufacturing, This condition violates S. El Monte Code Sections 17.18.030 and 17.18.190, which require that manufacturing must be "entirely within an enclosed building...." The openings also violate Code Section 17.050.020 (B), which requires that "Industrial or commercial buildings will maintain a five feet side or rear setback from : multiple residential zone district with no openings other than required fire exits facing the residential property." (Emphasis supplied.)
3. Outdoor storage
The Lawrence factory stores materials and other items on high scaffolding that towers over fencing and is visible from homes in El Monte, This violates South EI Monte Code Section 17.18.040 (C) requiring all storage to be located within a fenced and screened area. We have attached photos taken from El Monte showing an example of the outdoor storage.
4. Barbed wire and metal fencing
Lawrence Equipment has installed barbed wire and metal fencing running the border between the factory and residential properties in the City of El Monte. Photos are attached. The metal fencing and barbed wire are an eyesore and nuisance and violate S. El Monte Code Sections 17.050.020 which requires an 8 foot tall 8 masonry wall on the property line abutting a residential zone. The barbed wire aud metal fencing also violate Section 17.050.030, which requires that the factory be a operated in a manner that will not interfere with residents' enjoyment
of their property,

S. Hours of operation adjacent to residential properties

Though located directly adjacent to residential properties, the Lawrence factory conducts its manufacturing operations late at night and early in the morning. The factory's late night and early moming operations interfere with the quality of life of residents. This is in violation of
Code Section 17,50.030, which set forth the South El Monte performance standards for industrial
and commercial uses next to a residential zone, These standards require that the Lawrence factory "be operated in a manner that will not interfere with the residents' enjoyment of their property." The Lawrence operations are very clearly interfering with neighbors' enjoyment of their property.

The Lawrence factory's all-night operations are incompatible with the residential
neighborhood located directly adjacent to the factory, This is in violation of Section 17.50.030(G), which requires that the Lawrence hous of operation to "be compatible with the needs and character of the surrounding neighborhood." The factory's hours of operation also

30

Letter to City of South EI Monte April 26, 2017
Page 3

violate the provision of that section requiring Planning Commission approval for any operation outside the hours of six am to ten pm. We are informed that there is no use permit or other Planning Commission approval authorizing the extended hours of factory operation directly adjacent to this residential neighborhood. Nor should there be any such approval given that the factory operates directly adjacent to a long established residential neighborhood and extended hours of operation are not compatible with the adjoining restdential uses.
6. Operation of forklifts and mechanical equipment directly next to residential properties
There is a narrow set back between the Lawrence factory building and the residential property line. Within this narrow set back, Lawrence operates equipment, including the operation of forklifts, which cause noise and disruption to neighboring residential properties, This is in violation of the South El Monte performance standards, including Section
17.50.030(F).

7. Prohibited operation of a machine shop next to residential uses

The South El Monte Code restricts the type of manufacturing activity that can take place adjacent to or across the street from a residential zone. Section 17.18.060 provides the following:

"Uses prohibited on property located adjacent to or across a public or private street from a residential zone:

(4) Machine shops employing such operations as deburring, the use of high speed drilling, sawing or cutting of metals; the use of any punch press over twenty tons capacity and the use of brakes or other equipment capable of producing excessive noise or vibration, including drop hammers"

The Lawrence factory uses heavy machinery to manufacture its stainless steel ovens and conveyors, including: laser cutters, brakes, lathes, milling machines, spray booths, abrasive blasting equipment. The equipment used by Lawrence causes unreasonable noise and vibration in the neighborhood. We are informed that Lawrence uses the following maohinery adjacent to a residential zone in violation of Section 17,18.060:

Two Press Brakes - each 45,000 pounds (22.5 tons) in weight and each with 350 ton capacity, used to form metal
One Trumpf Trumatic L3030 4,000 watt Laser Cutting Machine - 28,600 pounds
(14 tons) in weight, used to cut metal
One TruLaser 2030, 2,000 watt Laser Cutting Machine - 36,000 pounds (18 tons) in weight used to cut metal

Letter to City of South El Monte April 26, 2017
Page 4

There may be other machines used in the Lawrence factory that also violate the prohibition set out in Section 17.18.060.

8. The Lawrence Equipment factory is an unlawful public nuisance
For the reasons stated above, the Lawrence Equipment factory constitutes a public nuisance that is prohibited under Section 8.36.015 of the South El Monte Municipal Code. Section 8.36.015(A) defines a prohibited public nuisance as the following:
"A public nuisance is any violation of this code or anything ... offensive to the senses, or an obstruction to the free use of property, so as to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or perty by a neighborhood or by a considerable number of
persons...."

As stated above, the Lawrence factory is in violation of the South El Monte Municipal Code, which constitutes a nuisance per se. Furthermore, the noise and vibration emitted by the factory
into the neighborhood is offensive to the senses and interferes with the lives of El Monte
residents who live in the neighborhood adjacent to the factory.

The Lawrence Equipment factory is also a disturbance of the peace prohibited under
Section 8.36.015(B) (4). That section provides:
"No person shall willfully disturb the peace or quiet of any neighborhood or person by doing any of the following: (a) Creating or causing to be created any loud, unnecessary of unusual noises."

Through prior letters and other complaints, Lawrence Equipment is aware that its operations injure those who live nearby the factory by cause unreasonable noise and vibration in the adjoining residential neighborhood. Therefore, its actions are a willful disturbance of the peace and quiet of this El Monte residential neighborhood.
The Lawrence Equipment factory further constitutes a nuisance because of the substandard and blight conditions the factory causes. Though located directly next to a residential neighborhood, the Lawrence factory persists in using metal fencing and barbed wire
along property lines it shares with residential neighbors and storing materials high above fence lines. The substandard conditions created by Lawrence violate Section 8,36.015(B) (7), which prohibits any "fence, structure that is visible from any adjacent property, [or] street, that may detrimentally affect the aesthetic and economic value of the property in the immediate vicinity."

Dear Planning Commissioners and Ms. Davis:

My name is Adolfo Carrillo and I am a concerned resident and homeowner of 12206
Chosen St. in the City of El Moute. Tt is my understauding that the owners of Lawrence Bquipment (2094 Peok Rd., South El Monte) is proposing to demolish sxisting connnercial and residential structures located in my neighborhood, which is a residential area of the City of Fl Monte and construct a warehouse and parking lot changing my neighborhood into an industrial
ared.

My noighbors and I have wrltten you many tirnes opposing expansion of the Lawrence
factory and complaining about the nolse and vibration caused by the Lawrence faotory. The
noise only gets worse. I am concerned that if Lawrence is allowed to expaud again, it will ouly
increase their operation and inorease the noise and disturbance to my neighbors and me.

For the past 20 years I have lived behind Lawrsnce Equipment and throughout these
years as Lawrence buys more propexties and expands Ihave hoard and folt the ever inoroasing
nolses and vibration caused by Lawrence Equipment's industrial saws, forklifs, alr compressors,
puach press machine, grinders, ect., and the loudest of them all is what sounds lco. a plasma or
totch metal cutter. When this machine is on me and my neighbots cannot have a conversation in
our own backyards.

Algo, to make matters worse, recently Lawsence Rquipment apened a wide siding door in.
the back of his building facing te and mny neighbers' backyards. They cut the new door into a
place in the siding that was solid and did not have a doer before, This new open door is another
opening in the Lawrence buildings that face our backyards.
There is uaurow arta. between the baok of my yard and the Lawrence buildings. This area yuns all the way behind the Lawrence buildiogs and they use this area to run their forklifts direotly behind my proparty. They run their forklifts from open door to open door. and we hear the noise of the forklifts going back and forth along the Lawrence buildings.

1T

I have also noticed an increase in truck traffic including commercial vebicles and employee vehicles parked on Chosen Street, These disturbances go on all day and night as well as weekends,

am stressed out over the Lawrence proposal of expanding their plant over to my residential neighborhood. This property is very important to me not only because I live here, but also because it is important to me financially. If the Lawrence proposal is built, I believe my property will lose value.

T am against Lawrence Equipment expanding into my residential neighborhood. There should be no entrance or exit for Lawrence Equipment traffic on 'Chosen Street. Peck Road and Durfee are wider streets and are designed for this type of traffic.
As a tax-paying boreowner, long term resident and concerned constituent of the City of El Monte I humbly request our local representatives from the City of El Monte advocate for the rights, health and safety of our community aud place a stop to this expansion of Lawrence Equipment in our beautiful residential neighborhoad,
I thank you in advance for your anticipated firm and resolute advocacy on behalf of our community,

I am writing to express my objection to a proposed zone change on my street,
Futhermore, I am against any expansion of any business on Chosen Street. No parking lots ox Industrial buildings belong on a residential street. No expansion of Lawrence Equipment,
Within the past few years, RESIDENTIAL property has been acquired by Mr. John
Lawrence with the plan to change the zone and bulld parking lots and industrial bulldings. Mr.
Lawrence knew that the properties he was buying were residential properties and he knew that
these propertios were located in our neighborhood and next to other residential properties. Ho
wants to expand his company and rake a lot more money. That's good for him, but had for me.
This is my home. Mr. Lawrence's plan would destroy the residential character of this

The perverted Lawrence workers that would harass my friends and I aS we tried to enjoy my pool. The cracks in ny pool and deck. are from the forklifls being used by the Lawrence oompany right behind my property, Lawzence employees would drink beer in front of my house and throw their trash on the sirset or on my curb.

Every time I have had company over, they ask how can you live with that noise all the time? 1 need someone on my side. I. call El Monte police when they are banging and doing God knows what at 11 pm or midnight, They say they can't help ane and to take it op with South El Monte, I can't win.

Then there is the wall that John Lawrence put up years ago, It is brick, then metal on top of brick, then barbed wire on top of that. My back yard looks like a prison.
The noise from the Lawrence factory just keeps getting worse. I have a picture sbowing our backyard before any buildings were behind us. We had a nice fence then and not Mr. Lawrence's metal and barbed wire fence, I have watched as Lawrence has gotten bigger and bigger and the noise and interference with our lives has gotten worse and worse. Years ago the noise was not so bad. But, today, things are different, I hear Lawrence workers hammering metal on metal and ronning big machines. They work right belind my back yard with sides to their building wide open and run their forklifts back and forth right behind my back yard.
About three years ago, Mr. Lawrence came to my house and told me he had bought the house two doors down from me, He was obviously interested in buying my house too. Hle told mo that he had a great tax guy and that I oould soll my house and buy another taxes. Obviously I would not sell. one without paying

My house is not just a house, It is my home. Grandma taught me to swim here. Grandpa fixed my bike in the garage and taught me to tle a hook on a line so we could go fishing. My mom would hide Baster eggs in the front yard, Thave lived on Chosen Street mny whole life, You can't put a price on these things. Money can't buy you everything.
My grandfather fought in WW I! and originally lived in this house. He didn't fight for his country and work hard all his life to OWA a home to have it lose its value because of this.. What Mr. Lawrence is doing to mo and to our neighborhood is wrong.

RE: Opposition to Lawrence Equipment Project and Comments on Euvironmental Document
Dear Plauning Commiasion and Ms. Davis:
I own the property at 12222 Chosen St., El Monte and oppose any expansion of the Lawreuce factory.
My property is my home and my investment. The proposal from Lawrence will be bad for me and. my tenants and bad for me financially.
For about 50 years have lived here. I was here before the Lawrence factory. I live in the house fronting Chosen Street, I have thuee units at the rear of my property which I rent. The units are tivo story and baok up to the current Lawrence factory. The units were also built prior to the Lawrence factory moving in.
Until Lawrenge bought the house next door, I had neighbors. We had a regular noighborhood here on Chosen Straet with houses next to each other like a regular neighborhood where poople live. It was a pleasant place and the views out my windows and fiont yard were pleasant,
There is about five feet between my house and the property line that separates tby property from the houses next door that Lawrence now owns. My kitchen windowr is.a bay window that extands into my side yard. The window provides light for my kitchen and is what I look out of when I use my kttchen. My bouse has another room with a window that looks out to the neighboring property and on to the street. Two of my units (including the upstairs unit) have windows that look over the neighhoring property.
AsI understand It, the Lawrence compauy wants to zear down the houses next door and build so they can expend fheir factory and bulld a parking lot. I understaud that they propose to build an 8 foot high blook wall along the length of our property live and then have parking lot • and bullding lights on all night. also understand that an environmental report says that the Lawrence plan would not significantly impact my property. I disagree.

35

G

The Lawrence blook wall would takce away all views and light from my kitohea and this side of my property, The block wall would be fve feet from my house and my kitchen window and otber windows in my buildings would look straight into a blook wall. The wall would block my view, block my sunlight, and look ugly,
My back unit that is a second story unit might still have a vlew out of its windows, But,
: that view would be the Lawrence parking lot, lights and factory,

I ad concerned nbout the added noise from the cars parking right next door and from the
Lawtenoe factory being extended to right next door. Car engines, doors and beeps right next to-
we is too much.

Because the Lawrence factory ie directly behind my property, Iknow the noise they dause and itis already too loud. The Lawrence butlding behind me is made of metal and part of itis open to the air. Because the walls ate open, I can see over the fence and into the Lawrence plant. Lawrence has a big crahe that is used to move heavy materials and to do assembly. 1 hear tho crash of the crane dropping materials. From my house, I hear the bang, bang, bang of the Lawrence plant aud it is too-mauoh, The noiseds particularly bad late at uight and early in the momning when everything, except the Lawrence plant, is quiet. At 6 AM. I hear banging fram. Nes -a... .-
the Lawrence facibry and it wakes me up.

Lawrence should not be allowed to expaud into the neighborhood, Additional Lawrence
noise coming from cars early in the morning or late at night is too much. We should not haye to
take more noise and disruption.
I am also concemed about the hours Lawrence operates. They run their factory whenever they want without any care for the people who live here. I am concerned, that Lawrence would ran ligkts all night and that the ligat would intrude into mny house and my temants' hores. Hamn concerned about the added traffic and that what once was a neighborliood of homes would be turned industrial,

If the Lawrence project is approved the value of my property will go down. I am concerned that I few people will want to live with au 8 foot wall, patking lot and factory on one side and a factory behind making all kinds of noise, This property is my home and my investment. I will lose money on my investinent if the project is approved,
I already kuow the Lawrence company wauts to buy my property. They offered to buy my property aud. gave me a sorowy appraisal that wes all wröng.
T ask that the City deny the Lawrence Equipment project.
Sinceroly,
MameaNlustto)

Subject: Lawrence Equipment/El Monte CA

Upon your request, the undersigned reviewed noise
complaints and other documentation which you provided
concerning the operation of existing manufacturing facilities of the subject company located within the South El Monte city limits and a proposed 34,000 square foot expansion of the factory into the City of El Monte.
Additionally, I requested, and was provided, sound level
readings and audio recordings taken by Gary Floyd' at the residential property line adjacent to the Lawrence Equipment facility, left of the pool shown in the aerial photo below.

Using a General Instruments DSM403SD Type I data recording sound level meter, noise level data recordings were taken on April 28, starting around 6:20AM and continuing until 8:00AM. As can be seen in the histogram,

75dBA initial noise levels were in the mid-sixties, rising into the high seventies and eighties as factory activity increased.

As the Initial Study noted, the daytime ambient in the
neighborhood averages about 53dBA in the daytime, and

- 49dBA at night. The noise from the factory during this period +0:7:9 ZE:OZ-9 B0#TE:9 98:LZ:9

averaged over 72dBA - about 20dBA over the ambient.4

In the sampling, we estimate that the level exceeded 75dBA
about 20% of the time, and 80dBA about 4% of the time

Audio recordings were also taken, and, after analyzing these approaching 90dBA at one point.

recordings, we determined that the sound at this location emanated from the Lawrence Equipment facilities and that any outside noise was insignificant.
Some of the factory noise specifically noted was:

a. Movement of a metal-wheeled cart on a

b. A multi-frequency persistent "squeal" coming from some piece of rotating machinery, possibly a conveyor roller or mixer.
C. A whistle-like sound typical of an air-powered grinder. d. The sound of hammering with pipes dropping onto the concrete floor.
e. A sound like eggs in a frying pan that could be
noise emanating from a laser/plasma cutting torch on a water table. f. Varlous material handling noises, including forklift operations and a sound similar to scrap metal being gathered and dumped.
It is my opinion that the noise emanating from the open doorways of the factory (see photo below) is reflecting off the hard surfaces of the wall, the building and the passageway literally being amplifled? prior to flanking the relatively low wall and being directed into the residential
areas.

Sound reflecting off a hard surface has the effect of, at most, doubling the energy. This is a noticeable increase, depicted as a threo decibel rise. The effect is lessened the farther the reflective surface is from the source.

uF

a covitata

Based on this Information, I can state with a high degree of certainty that:

1. The noise that was measured at the residential property line bordering the Lawrence Equipment factory emanates primarily from the metal building shown in foreground in white on the aerial photo.
2. Audio recordings taken at this location confirm that virtually all the noise is coming from this Lawrence Equipment building, with negligible contribution from other sources. It is my opinion that the sound, radlating itself and passing through the open door, is actually building from the metal building
in intensity because of the reverberation off the hard surfaces of the building, ground and 8' wall separating the properties.

3. The sound pressure levels that were recorded at the residential property line of properties located on Chosen Street indicate that Lawrence
Equipment is in clear violation of:

a. The El Monte Noise Ordinance, Section 8.36.040 and 8.36.050B,E b. The South El Monte noise ordinance, Sections 8.20.020 and 8.20.030.

4. The 30' high concrete wall of the proposed building on the northwest side will further serve to reflect the existing noise and any additional noise emanating from the proposed parking area, resulting in a "channeling" effect and an increase in the noise radiating to other residents along Chosen Street of as much as 3dBA.3

5. The purpose of the plant expansion, as stated, is to increase productivity and efficiency, It is logical, therefore, to assume that the fabrication and material handling support functions in the existing buildings will increase as well. As a consequence, the noise emanating from the existing facility, in both intensity and duration, will increase proportionately.

PROJECT:
Study and analysis of the acoustical impact of the noise and environmental sound intrusion from the adjacent Lawrence Equipment Manufacturing "North Side" and the Chosen Street residential neighborhood directly abutting,

Summary of findings and comments follow.

METHODOLOGY

The premises at Chosen Street consist of single family residences with garages and/or standalone structures such as sheds. The Lawrence facility manufactures restaurant equipment. The property line is walled with a cinder block wall and intrusion wire on the top. The observation location was close to center of the various properties, near the main door. As the time and duration of the noise intrusion is both continuous and intermittent but occurs on a daily basis, our approach was to utilize a sound level data recorder meter to take measurements over an extended period of time, as well as having an audio recording to study the noise and noise peaks to verify sounds as being from the facility. Ambient sound levels were also measured and then compared with the measurements of the
sound level created by the noise from Lawrence. The two levels were charted with the resulting
difference of the intrusive sound noted as the "increase over ambient". "Peak" levels are also noted
and compared with the "ambient" levels.
Standards utilized are as set forth by South El Monte Code Chapter 8.20 Noise, with specific
requirements in 8.80.

All sound levels were measured using a General 403SD Class 1 Sound Level Meter with Data
Logging. Additional spot measurements were made with a Larson Davis 800 series meter. All meters
were set to "A" weighting and a "Slow" time constant. Calibration of the sound level meter was done
with an acoustic calibrator immediately prior to recording sound level data. A final check of calibration was made at the conclusion of the test, The results are noted in terms of "dB(A)" in the
chart.

FINDINGS

Table 1 and 2 shows the calculated results of the observed noise levels based on night and day data.
Charts and 2 also graphically show the noise over time. Listening to the audio of the same time periods indicated that the peaks were generally from large metal pieces being dropped to the floor. Other types of noises were of a continuous, intermittent and impact type. Some were from transport of material with a clattering cart and rumbling forklift which had a backup alarm as well. The forklift motor revs and strains with various loads. The warehouse door creates its own noise. Tool noise from
hammering, air tools, compressors, saws, grinding, whirring are also in effect. Some of the equipment is operated for short and long durations, anywhere from a minute to portions of an hour, The average "ambient" noise level measured ranged from a low of 46 decibels to a high of 52
decibels and is consistent with our expectation for a normal residential environment. Some outside intermittent sources of noise can be observed as well on occasion, i.e. airplane, dog bark, nearby trash truck but are at a low level of noise,

Chart 1/Table 1 also shows the peak reading measured which was at 98.7 dbA, additional peak readings were also observed. Over 100 peaks over 75dbA were charted over in the 6-7 AM observing period. Essentially noise disturbances occur every 2-3 minutes, sometimes every 10 seconds. Based on the data collected, work is also being conducted late at night past 12:00 AM and on the weekends.
In addition, similar intrusive noise has been obseryed at the West end of the complex due to similar operations from machine shop and fabrication work as well as forklift and truck activity.

CONCLUSIONS

The measurements and analysis show that the noise intrusion from "Lawrence Equipment" is real and measurable. It is also over the City of South El Monte's proscribed limits for noise at 45 dbA
nighttime and 50 dbA daytime as well as adjusted limits.

Adjusting for time variation, an additional minus (-) five (5) adjustment is calculated due to the nature of the noise, thus the proscribed limit is at 40 dbA for conducting activities involving music, continuous sound or hammering, eto. As noted in Table in 2, the sound level would be 19 to 27 dbA over the adjusted standard depending on time and adjustment. Regardless, any adjustment still indicates a level over what is required,

Based on the data observed and analyzed, the noise intruding on the residences on Chosen Street from Lawrence Equipment is in violation of the South El Monte ordinances in Section 8.20. and in particular Sections 8.20.030 D and H which do not require specific noise levels but prohibits noise disturbances. Applying these standards indicate a violation of the ordinances.
The quantity of "peak" noise intrusions as noted in Charts 3 and 4 are 3 random and unpredictable, adding to the nuisance of the noise occurrence and intrusion. Note "Addendum 1 - Effects of Noise on People" for a more detailed discussion of nolse intrusion.

Table 3 - Excerpts from the South El Monte Code:

8.20.020 Exterior noise limits.
A. Maximum Permissible Sound Levels By Recelving Land Use,

1. No person shall operate or cause to be operated any source
of sound a:t any tocation within the olty Ór allow the oreatlon of any nolse

on property owned, leased or
occupled or otherwise controlted by such person, which
causes the noise level when measured on any other property to exceed:
The exterior noise limit for that land use or
zone as specified in Table | or Table 2 for a cumulative period
of more than thirty minutes in any hour; or
b. The exterlor noise limlt for that land use or
zone. as specified In Table or Table 2 plus 5 dbA for 2
cumulative perlod of more than fifteen minutes in any hour:
or

C. The exterior noise llmit for that land use or

zone as specifled in Table or Table 2 plus 10 dbA for á
cumulative perlod of more than five minutes In any hoür: or

d. The exterlor nolse llmit plus 15 dbA for El
cumulative period of more than minute In any hour:

e, The exterior nolse limtt for that land use or
zone as spectfled In Table Table 2 plue 20 dbA for any
period of time.
2. Jp the event the alleged offonslve noise contalns a
steady, audible tone such whine, soreech, or hum, or it is a
repetitive noisesuch as a hammering or rivetind, or contains mugic or spaech conveying informational content, theexterior noise limits set
forth in Tables.1 and 2 shall be teduced by 5 dbAs
3, Ir the measured amblent nolse level exceeds that
permissible within any of the first four nolse limit oat-
egories above, the allowable noise limits set forth in Table 1 or 2 shall
be adjusted In 5 dbA Increments in each category as appropriate to
encompass or reflect the amblent nose level. In the event the ambient
nolse level exceods the
fifth nolse llmit category, the exterjor noise Ilmlt under the fifth
category shäll be increased to reflect the maximum amblent noise level.
4. Noise Measurement Procedure. The noise level
shall be measured as e position or positions at any point on the
redelvers property utillzing the A-welghting soale of
the sound level meter and the "slow" meter response for non+
impulsive type nolses and "fast" response for impulsive type sounds, When
feaslble, the microphone shall be located ap-
proximately four to five foet abave the ground and ten feet
or more from the nearest refleotive surface. In those cases
where the etandard elevation is not feasible. the most
closely approximate elevation posslble shall be utilized.
Calibration of the measurement equipment, utllizing an
acouetical calibrator, shall be performed immedlately prior to recording
any nojse data.

Addendum 1 - Exerpt on Effects of Noise on People

Effects of Noise on People

Noise is generally loud, unpleasant, unexpected, or undesired sound that is typically associated with human activity that is a nuisance or disruptive. The effects of noise on people can be placed into four general categories:
U Subjective effects (e.g., dissatisfaction, annoyance)
0 Interference effects (e.g., communication, sleep, and learning interference)
U Physiological effects (e.g., startle response)
0 Physical effects (e.g., hearing loss)

Although exposure to high noise levels has been demonstrated to cause physical and physiological effects, the principal human responses to typical environmental noise exposure are related to subjective effects and irterference with activities. Interference effects of environmental noise refer to those effects that interrupt daily activities and include interference with human communication activities, such as normal conversatlons, watching television, telephone
conversations, and interference with sleep. Sleep interference effects can include both awakening and arousal to a lesser state of sleep. With regard to the subjective effects, the responses of individuals to similar noise events are diverse and are influenced by many factors, including the
type of noise, the perceived importance of the noise, the appropriateness of the noise to the setting, the duration of the noise, the time of day and the type of activity during which the noise occurs, and individual noise sensitivity.
Overall, there is no completely satisfactory way to measure the subjective effects of noise, or the corresponding reactions of annoyance and dissatisfaction on people. A wide variation in individual thresholds of annoyance exists, and different tolerances to noise tend to develop based on an individual's past experiences with noise.

Letter to Lawrence Equipment, Ino., City of South El Monte November 21, 2017
Page
On May 5, 2017, Lawrence's attorney, Ms. Kolieb, wrote to South El Monte's City Manager, Jennifer Vasquez, its development manager, Manttel Mancha and its head of code enforoement, Joe Martinez, The correspondence referenced the Save ow Neighborhood compleint letter. Addressed to "Teunifer, Manny and Joe," the correspondence fiom Lawrence's attorney states, "Toe, I know you are reviewing the letter. Needless to say, none of his olaims are valid." On June 19, there was additional correspondence from Ms. Kolieb to Manual Mancha regarding the Save our Neighborhood complaint letter."
The City of South El Monte never responded to our complaints. On May 10, May 31, June 2 and June 9, we requested the city's response. City documents show that Mís, Vasquez directed Mr. Maucha to respond to our complaints. But, neither Mancha nor any other city representative ever responded.

On August 15, 2017, we wrote the City of South BI Monte reiterating our complaints and attaching further documentation demonstrating Lawrence's code violations, Further dooumentation inoluded a June 12, 2017 report documenting noise violations from the factory, and.AQMD records showing Lawrence violates oity code by cutting and grinding metals and otherwise operating a machine shop adjacent to residential uses, Wo received no response.
With this letter, we are attaching the November 9, 2017 report of noise measurements conduoted from a residential backyard on Chosen Streot. As with the prior letters, this report shows noise levels well exceed South El Monte standards.

On behalt of Save our Neighborhood, we reiterate the complaints itemized and documented in our Aprll 26, 2017 lettor, which is supplemented by our August 15,2017 letter and the attached Noyember 9, 2017 report. Lawrence Equipment's code violations and nuisance oonditions continue to degrade the quality and liyability of the adjoining El Monte residential neighborhood.
For many years and in many ways, Lawrence Rquipment has taken advantage of this neighborhood, No reasonable factory owner would have built its faotory directly adjacent to a residential neighborhood, But, Lawrence did. As its faotory grew, Lawrence's disregard for its residential neighbors grew as well, Today, behind metal fencing and barbed wire, Lawrence runs 20-ton machines and grinds, cuts, blasts and hammers metal fiom substandard facilities right next to homes, Lawrence has a duty to comply with all state laws and city codes and a duty to refrain from conducting a nuisance, Demand is made that Lawrence Equipment, Ino. immediately coase operating a nuisance and immediately comply with all laws and oodes.

T Thase dacuments were produced on October 25, 2017 by the City of South El Monte in response to our public records recuiest.

Letter to Lawrence Equipment, Ino.; City of South El Monte November 21, 2017 Page 3

No responsible city would have allowed Lawrence to build and expand its factory squdwiched between residential and retail uses. But South El Monte did, Not only that, but from its refusal to exert any regulation, over Lawrence Equipment or even to respond to our many complaints, the City of South EI Monte sanctions a continuing nuisance within its jurisdiction. By all appearances, Lawrence has full control over the City of South El Monte and, for all practioal purposes; there has been no city oversight. Yet, the City of South El Monte bas a duty to enforce its Municipal Code and a duty to abate nuisanoes within its jurisdiction. Demand is made that the City of South. El Monte immediately aot to enforce its Municipal Code and to abate the nuisance that exists at the Lawrence Equipment factory,
Very truly yours, Uirattun Michael J, Coppess
