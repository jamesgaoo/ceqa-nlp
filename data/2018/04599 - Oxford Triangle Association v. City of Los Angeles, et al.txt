VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

Petitioner, OXFORD TRIANGLE ASSOCIATION (*Petitioner"), alleges through this
2 Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declarative and Injunctive Relief
("Petition"), as follows:

INTRODUCTION

1. Petitioner challenges the approvals by Respondent City of Los Angeles ("City" or
"Respondent") of two new land use ordinances passed simultaneously with the goal of providing
shelter and supportive housing for Los Angeles homeless population. Ordinance No. 185492
titled the "Permanent Supporting Housing Ordinance" ("PSHO") and Ordinance No. 185489 the
"Interim Hotel Conversion Ordinance" (*IMCQ") were both adopted by the Los Angeles City
10 Council on April 11, 2018 to provide the City and real estate developers with streamlined
11 approval methods; environmental review exemptions; and other land use concessions in
41Z06 Channel Law Group, De e 'SI!H 4305 V p pa uhluS I A 038 Beverly 12 exchange for building projects designed to shelter and support Los Angeles growing homeless
13 population (the "Project").
14 2. The Project was not subjected to adequate environmental review under the
15 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). As supporting environmental documentation,
16 the City certified a Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND") for the PSHO a Negative
17 Declaration ("MND") for the IMCO and an addendum to the Programmatic Environmental
18 Impact Report ("PEIR") prepared for the Regional Transportation Plan (the "Environmental
19 Review Documents.") The Environmental Review Documents were legally inadequate because
20 A) A full environmental impact report ("EIR") was required to be prepared but was not; B) the
21 Project was improperly analyzed as two separate actions; C) the Project precommitted the city to
22 a further project requiring environmental review which was not reviewed resulting in improper
23 piecemealing; and D) the individual Environmental Review Documents themselves were legally
24| defective for various procedural and substantive reasons.
25 3. Petitioner requests that this Court vacate, set aside, rescind and void all of the
26 Environmental Review Documents, actions, resolutions, ordinances, amendments and findings
27

28 2

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

related to the Project. The Project was approved by the City of Los Angeles on or about April 11,

2 2018. Petitioner requests that the Court vacate the Project because Respondent failed to comply
3 with the provisions set forth under the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources
Code section 21000, et seq. ("CEQA"), the State Planning and Zoning Law, and local laws and

5 therefore failed to proceed in a manner required by law.

6 4. Petitioner seeks a Peremptory Writ of Mandate under California Code of Civil
Procedure section 1094.5, directing Respondent to vacate, rescind and set aside all Project
8 Approvals and the certification of the EIR because Respondent failed to comply with CEQA and
9 applicable State Planning and Zoning Laws.

PARTIES 10

11 5. Petitioner, OXFORD TRIANGLE ASSOCIATION is a nonprofit mutual benefit
41Z06
8 0E S auns "pAla eJjySIIM oOZ8 12 corporation dedicated to the protection of both the community and the environment in Los Channel Law Group, 13 Angeles. Petitioner and its respective members have a direct and substantial beneficial interest in
'SILH Aueseg 14 ensuring that Respondent complies with laws relating to environmental protection. Petitioner and
15 its respective members are adversely affected by Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA in
16 approving the Project. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because
17 Petitioner and its members' aesthetic and environmental interests are directly and adversely
18 affected by Respondent's' approval of the Project.
19 6. Respondent, City of Los Angeles, is charter city incorporated under the laws of
20 the State of California. The City is the lead agency under CEQA.
21 7. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Real Parties sued herein
22 as DOES 1-25, inclusive, and therefore sues these Real Parties by such fictitious names.
23 Petitioner will amend this Petition to allege the true names and capacities of fictitiously named
24 Real Parties in Interest. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that each
25 Respondent designated herein as a DOE has some responsibility for the events and happenings
26 alleged in this Petition.

17 the use of existing hotels and motels for Supportive Housing or Transitional Housing for persons
18 experiencing homelessness or those at risk of homelessness, including allowing for minor

Management Committee held public hearings to consider the Project. On or about April 11, 2018
2 the full City Council held public hearings to consider the Project. The City Council certified the
3 MND, ND and Addendum and approved the Project.

4 15. On or about April 11, 2018, the City filed a Notice of Determination ("NOD")
5 with the County Recorder.

6 CEQA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS

7 16. In 1970, the California Legislature enacted CEQA, as a means of forcing public
agency decision makers, such as Respondent, to document and consider the environmental
9 implications of its actions. CEQA's fundamental goal is to fully inform the public and the
10 decision makers as to the environmental consequences of proposed projects and to assure
11
8 Channel Law Group, LLP members of the public that their elected officials are making informed decisions. CEQA requires
12 governmental authorities, such as Respondent, to fully evaluate potential environmental effects
8 euns "pala BuIySI!M 0OZ8 41706 13 of projects, and to seek feasible means to reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that
‡ 14 otherwise could result from their actions, CEQA limits agencies from approving projects with
Beverly 15 significant adverse impacts when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen such impacts.
16 17. If a project will not result in potentially significant effects on the environment, the
17 government agency may prepare a negative declaration. •Mitigated negative declarations are
18 prepared when a project applicant revises t project to eliminate or avoid all significant impacts
19 by incorporating mitigation measures into the project. A proposed mitigated negative
20 declaration circulated for review and comment must describe the project as modified to
21 incorporate mitigation measures. Mitigation measures cannot be improperly deferred and must
22 eliminate or avoid all significant environmental impacts of the project. An agency adopting a
23 mitigated negative declaration must provide members of the public, as well as responsible
24 agencies and trustee agencies with notice of its intention to adopt the mitigated negative
25 declaration. An agency adopting a mitigated negative declaration must also adopt a mitigation
26 monitoring or reporting program for the mitigation measures incorporated into the negative
27

28 5

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

declaration.

2 18. Where substantial evidence in the record of proceedings before the lead agency
supports a "fair argument" that one or more significant environmental effects could occur as a
result of approval and implementation of a project CEQA requires preparation of an
environmental impact report ("EIR"). The primary function of the EIR is to discuss the
important environmental consequences of the project, including cumulative effects, and to
provide the agency and the general public with mitigation measures and alternatives to the
project that would have Jess serious environmental consequences. A lead agency is required to
9 consult with responsible agencies in determining whether an EIR shall be prepared. Responsible
10  agencies are public agencies which propose to carry out or approve a project, for which the lead
11 agency is preparing or has prepared an EIR or negative declaration. § Channel Law Group, d77 41Z06 eHnS "pAla euIJuSI!M ooZ8 12 19. Under CEQA, lead agencies, such as Respondent, are required to prepare a
13 8 complete and legally adequate EIR prior to approving any discretionary project that may have a
'SI!H Beverly 14 significant adverse effect the environment. The EIR must fully disclose and adequately on

15 analyze the project's potentially significant environmental effects. CEQA also requires lead
16 agencies, such as Respondent, to consider mitigation measures and alternatives to a project,
17 adopt all feasible mitigation measures and/or alternatives, determine whether proposed
18 mitigation measures will be effective in avoiding or substantially lessening the project's
19 significant environmental impacts, and to make adequate findings, including an adequate
20 statement of overriding consideration for those significant environmental impacts deemed
21 unavoidable. Lead agencies, such as Respondent, may not avoid the duty to prepare an EIR by
22 segmenting : project into several smaller projects.
23 20. When a government agency adopts a negative declaration, mitigated negative
24 declaration or an EIR, it must exercise its independent judgment and analysis.

6 documentation that complies with the requirements of the statute. The lead

7 provide for public review and comment on the project and associated environmental
8 documentation. CEQA is designed to provide sufficient environmental analysis such that
9 decision-makers can intelligently consider environmental consequences when acting on proposed
10 projects.
11 23. Respondents violated CEQA by: certifying an MND, an ND, and an Addendum to 8 d17 'dnoJg MET jauueyd L1Z06 euns "pala BJYSI!M 00Z8 12 a PEIR for the Project that are inadequate and fail to comply with CEQA. Among other things,

exemption.

V. Inadequately addressed the environmental consequences of, possible
mitigation measures for, and potential alternatives to the Project.
vi. Did not adequately address issues raised by public comments,
including all other issues mentioned herein.

24. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion

approving the Project in reliance thereon. Accordingly, Respondent's certification of the
9 Environmental Review Documents and approval of the Project must be set aside.

10 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

17 requirements applicable to the Project.
18 28. Petitioner has the right to enforce these mandatory duties.
19 29. Petitioner has no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy at law, and will suffer
20 irreparable injury unless it receives the relief requested in this Petition.
21 30. An actual controversy exists between Petitioner and Respondents as to whether
22 the actions and conduct of Respondents alleged in this Petition have violated CEQA and other
23 laws as identified herein. This controversy implicates the legality of the manner in which
24 Respondents have proceeded in giving the Project Approvals, the validity of the Respondents'
25 actions with respect thereto and, consequently, the legal ability of Respondents to take further
26 actions to develop the Project based upon the Project Approvals. The Petitioner contends that
27

each and all such actions and conduct have violated and will violate these laws. Petitioner is
informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that Respondents dispute these contentions. A
3 | judicial resolution of that controversy is now required pursuant to California Code of Civil
Procedure section 1060.

31. Petitioner requests a judicial declaration that Respondents' actions and conduct
alleged in this Petition have violated and will violate CEQA and other laws identified herein.
Such declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time under the circumstances in order that
Petitioner and Respondents may ascertain their rights and duties.
32. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.
10 No money damages or other legal remedy could adequately compensate Petitioner for the harms

Impact Report; Council File 17-0422, 17-1432; ENV-2017-3137-MND; ENV-2017-
3410-ND; SCH No. 2015031035; Oxford Triangle Association v. City of Long Beach et al.

Honorable Attorney General Becerra:

Enclosed please find a copy of the Petition for Writ of Mandate filed by Oxford Triangle Association. The Petition alleges, inter alia, that the City erroneously determined that Permanent Supportive Housing Ordinance (No. 185492) and Motel Conversion Ordinance (No. 185489) would have no significant effects on the environment. The Petition also challenges the Addendum to the Southern California Association of Government's 2016-2040 RTP/SCS Programmatic Environmental Impact Report ("PEIR") on the grounds that it is non-complaint with CEQA. The City Council of the City of Los Angeles approved the Ordinances and the Addendum on or about April 11, 2018.
Please call if you have any questions.

Sincerely, Q-A0p Jamie T. Hall

Enclosure: Petition for Writ of Mandate
