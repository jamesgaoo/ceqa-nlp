19 1. In this verified Petition for First Amended Writ of Mandate, Petitioner/Plaintiff

20 Johnson Controls, Inc. ("JCI") asks this Court to invalidate certain actions of Respondent/Defendant,

21 the South Coast Air Quality Management District ("District"), including the District's preparation of
22 environmental documents under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") and the

23 adoption of amendments to Rule 1111 based on the environmental document prepared. JCI asks this

24 Court to invalidate the March 2, 2018 amendments to Rule 1111 and order the District to perform a

25 new environmental analysis that is consistent with CEQA, including the preparation of a new
26 environmental document, providing a comment period, and holding a public hearing where all

27 necessary or appropriate amendments are heard, and for this court to retain jurisdiction while the

28 District complies with its statutory obligations.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR FIRST AMENDED WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELEF;
CASE NO. BS173018

2. The District's CEQA analysis was procedurally and substantively deficient. As

2 explained in detail in this First Amended Writ and Complaint, the District prepared an environmental

3 document analyzing the impacts of a different set of amendments to Rule 1111 than the District

4 actually proposed for adoption, and then, in response to comments, the District materially revised its

5 environmental analysis but did not circulate its environmental analysis for public comment. The

6 District concluded in its revised environmental analysis that the proposed project will have significant

7 adverse operational air impacts and that these impacts could not be mitigated - without assessing

8 possible mitigation measures - and then imposed a "mitigation fee" to fund a "separate" rebate

9 program that was not analyzed as a mitigation measure in the environmental analysis. Furthermore,

10 the District improperly piecemealed its CEQA analysis by excluding the integrally related rebate

11 program - a program the District expressly stated was a "companion" to the Project - from its
12 analysis. The District also improperly analyzed the cumulative impacts of the proposed rule

13 amendments. The District also lacks authority to impose a "mitigation" fee for the purpose of

14 generating general revenue for the District. For these reasons and for all the reasons identified herein,

15 the District's actions violated CEQA and this Court should invalidate the amendments to Rule 1111

16 and direct the District to conduct a new, compliant CEQA analysis, including providing public

17 comment period and holding a hearing, and analyzing the impacts, alternatives, and mitigation

18 measures for amendments to Rule 1111.

19 INTRODUCTION

20 3. The District's Rule 1111 regulates the emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) from

21 residential furnaces. On March 2, 2018, the District adopted amendments to Rule 1111. This writ and

22 complaint challenges the legal adequacy of District's environmental analysis and the ability of the

23 district to impose a general revenue fee.

24 4. As explained more fully herein, the amendments imposed a new fee on the sale of non-

25 compliant furnaces. The District has amended Rule 1111 several times and has repeatedly set

26 ambitious NOx emissions rates, which furnace manufacturers have been unable to achieve. The

27 District has permitted non-compliant furnaces to be sold in the District if the manufacturer paid a

28 "mitigation fee" on the sale of each non-compliant furnace. Among other things, the recent
2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR FIRST AMENDED WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;
CASE NO. BS173018

1 amendments to Rule 1111 establish the amount of the fee.

2 5. The District failed to perform a CEQA-compliant environmental review before

3 adopting the amendments to Rule 1111.

4 6. CEQA requires public agencies to analyze potentially significant environmental

5 impacts of proposed projects and a range of reasonable alternatives and to identify and implement

6 mitigation for significant impacts. CEQA further requires that the public be made aware of the

7 project, the potential impacts and mitigation to allow for public comments. The Lead Agency is to

8 review and respond to the public comments and provide all of this information to the agency decision-

9 makers and the public. The District failed to comply with CEQA by (1) failing to analyze the version

10 of Rule 1111 that the District adopted and not properly analyzing the potential significant

11 environmental impacts of amendments to Rule 1111; (2) segmenting its analysis to exclude a
12 forthcoming rebate program; (3) failing to analyze potential mitigation measures; (4) failing to

13 analyze an adequate range of alternatives; (5) failing to adequately analyze cumulative impacts; and

14 (6) failing to circulate the final environmental analysis for public comment. Additionally, the District

15 lacks authority to impose the fee established by Rule 1111. The District's justification for the

16 imposition of a "mitigation fee" is insufficient, as the District stated that the potentially adverse
17 environmental impacts arising from the sale of non-complying furnaces "cannot be mitigated."

18 Therefore, the District is imposing a "mitigation" fee that has the primary purpose of generating

19 revenue and therefore is improper. The fundamental purposes of CEQA- -public participation and an
20 assessment of potentially significant environmental impacts of a proposed project-have been

21 defeated by the District's actions.

22 PARTIES

23 7. JCI is multinational company with its domestic principal place of business in

24 Milwaukee, Wisconsin that manufacturers furnaces that are sold within the District that are regulated

25 by Rule 1111.

26 8. JCI participated in the rulemaking process for Rule 1111 and submitted comments

27 during the public comment period.

28 9. Respondent/Defendant South Coast Air Quality Management District is a state Public

Agency located in Southern California.

2 10. The District's jurisdiction includes all of Orange County, the urban portions of Los

3 Angeles and San Bernardino Counties southwest of the San Bernardino and San Gabriel mountains,

4 and nearly all of Riverside County.

5 11. Petitioner/Plaintiff is unaware of the true names and capacities of

6 Respondents/Defendants identified as Does 1-20, and sues such Respondents/Defendants herein by

7 fictitious names. Petitioner/Plaintiff is informed and believes, and on that basis, alleges that
8 Respondents/Defendants Does 1-20 are also responsible, in whole or in part, for the District's failure

9 to comply with required rulemaking procedures and applicable state laws. When the true identifies

10 and capacities of these Respondents/Defendants have been determined, Petitioner/Plaintiff will, with

11 leave of the Court if necessary, amend this Petition and Complaint to insert such identifies and

12 capacities.

13 REGULATORY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

14 12. The District's Rule 1111 - Reduction of NOx Emissions from Natural-Gas-Fired, Fan-

15 Type Central Furnaces - Was adopted in December 1978 and has been amended several times.

16 13. In November 2009, Rule 1111 was amended to establish a more stringent NOx

17 emission limit of 14 nanograms per joule (ng/J), and required the four major categories of residential

18 furnaces - condensing (high efficiency), non-condensing (standard), weatherized, and mobile home

19 heating units to meet the emission limit by specific dates.

20 14. In these same amendments to Rule 1111, the District also created a financial incentive

21 - a rebate program within Rule 1111 - for manufacturers to achieve early compliance with the 14 ng/J
22 NOx emission. Manufacturers that delivered and sold compliant furnaces were eligible to receive a

23 rebate payment from the District. The District allocated 3 million dollars for this rebate incentive.

24 15. Original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") were unable to meet the NOx emissions

25 limits established in 2009, and Rule 1111 allowed OEMs to sell non-compliant furnaces if the OEM

26 paid a mitigation fee to the District. AIl OEMs had been selling non-compliant furnaces and

27 submitting mitigation fees to the District.

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR FIRST AMENDED WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;
CASE NO. BS173018

16. In September 20[4, the District amended Rule 1111 again to delay the compliance

2 dates for the emission limit of 14 ng/J for all four categories of furnaces.

3 17. The 2014 amendments retained both the mitigation fee and the rebate program

4 incentive for manufacturers in Rule 1111.

5 18. In 2017, the District decided to amend Rule 1111 again because some OEMs stated

6 that they could now manufacture furnaces that achieved the 14ng/J standard.

7 19. In October 2017, the District prepared Proposed Amended Rule 1111 ("2017 PAR

8 1111"), which would extend the compliance date for the four categories of furnaces to achieve

9 compliance with 14 ng/J while also increasing the mitigation fee for non-compliant furnaces.

10 Importantly, and for the first time, 2017 PAR 1111 deleted the Rule 1111 rebate program and

11 proposed separating it into a separate, but "linked" program of the District. 2017 PAR 1111 also

12 would increase the mitigation fee from $150 for each non condensing, weatherized, or mobile home

13 furnace and $200 for each condensing furnace to $400 for all non-compliant furnaces to pay for, in
14 part, the now piecemealed rebate program, and extend the dates for complying with the NOx limit for

15 all four categories of furnaces:

16 a. October 1, 2019 for condensing furnaces;

17 b. October 1, 2019 for non-condensing furnaces;

18 C. October 1, 2020 for weatherized furnaces; and

19 d. October 1, 2022 for mobile home furnaces.

20 20. In December 2017, the District released a Draft Subsequent Environmental Assessment

21 ("Draft SEA") to evaluate the potential adverse environmental impacts of adopting 2017 PAR 1111.

22 In the Draft SEA, the District acknowledged that 2017 PAR 1111 is considered a "project" under
23 CEQA and that it would create a rebate program, which is a "separate action" from the rule

•24 amendment even though a rebate was formerly an integral part of Rule 1111.

25 21. In the Draft SEA, the District stated that, in addition to proposing a fee increase to
26 incentivize early conversion to compliant furnaces, it may also institute a rebate program, "which is a

27 separate action from the rule amendment." Elsewhere in the Draft SEA, the District reiterated this by

28 stating: "A rebate program, separate from the rule amendment, is also proposed."
5

CASE NO. BS173018

22. On January 9, 2018, the District hosted a Working Group meeting to discuss the

2 proposed amendments to Rule 1111. The PowerPoint prepared for the Working Group meeting

3 contained a different mitigation fee schedule than the fee schedule included in 2017 PAR 1111 and

4 analyzed in the Draft SEA. In the Working Group meeting, the District proposed a two-phased

5 "mitigation" fee and subdividing the four categories of furnaces into subcategories based on size. The

6 fee imposed on the sale of non-complying furnaces would vary based upon the equipment category,

7 the equipment size, and when the unit was sold, until the fees were eventually phased out.

8 23. The PowerPoint presentation given at the Working Group meeting also discussed

0 creating a rebate program.

10 24. On January 30, 2018, the District released its Draft Staff Report and a new a version of

11 the Proposed Amendment to Rule 1111 ("Draft 2018 PAR 1111"). The fee schedule in Draft 2018

12 PAR 1111 is the same as what was discussed in the Working Group meeting. However, Draft 2018

13 PAR 1111 varied in significant ways from 2017 PAR 1111.

14 25. In the Draft Staff Report, the District again acknowledged the creation of a rebate

15 program: "As a companion of the rule amendment, staff has also proposed to establish a rebate

16 program for consumers who purchase and install compliant furnaces in the [District] to benefit

17 consumers and incentivize the purchase of lower emitting compliant furnaces."

18 26. The Draft SEA was published before the District released the text of Draft 2018 PAR

19 1111.

20 27. The Draft Staff Report discusses Draft 2018 PAR 1111, but is not an environmental

21 document under CEQA and the Draft Staff Report does not analyze the potentially significant
22 environmental impacts of Draft 2018 PAR 1111.

23 28. The District did not provide a new public comment period when it released Draft 2018

24 PAR 1111.

25 29. On February 9, 2018, JCI submitted written comments during the Draft SEA's public

26 comment period, that questioned the deficiencies of the Draft SEA and the significant differences

27 between 2017 PAR 1111 and Draft 2018 PAR 1111.

28 30. In late February 2018, the District released a Final Subsequent Environmental
6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR FIRST AMENDED WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;
CASE NO. BS173018

Assessment ("Final SEA"). The Final SEA analyzed yet another version of amendments to Rule 1111

2 (*2018 PAR 1111").

3 31. In 2018 PAR 1111, the District retained the two-phased mitigation fee schedule

4 established in Draft 2018 PAR 1111, but changed the Phase One Mitigation Fee Start Date for

5 condensing furnaces. The District also removed the alternative compliance extension option for

6 mobile home units.

7 32. In contrast to Draft 2018 PAR 1111, 2018 PAR 1111 provided an exemption of rule

8 applicability for natural gas furnaces to be installed with propane conversion kits for propane firing
9 only.

10 33. In the Final SEA, the District again acknowledged that the amendments to Rule 1111 is

11 a "project" under CEQA that would cause significant air quality impacts.

12 34. The District made substantial changes in the Final SEA from the Draft SEA in the
13 sections discussing the proposed project and the project's environmental impacts. For example, the
14 District prepared a substantially revised analysis of the cumulative environmental impacts and
15 mitigation measures for 2018 PAR 1111. The District generally referred back to discussions of

16 cumulative impacts "in one or more previously certified EIRs" as "incorporated by reference," but did
17 not identify which EIRs upon which the District was relying.

18 35. In the Final SEA, the District concluded that the project would cause significant air

19 quality impacts but that cumulative air quality impacts are not expected to be significant because
20 implementation of other control measures is expected to result in net emission reductions and overall
21 air quality improvement. The District further concluded that no cumulative mitigation measures for

22 operation are required.

23 36. The District also stated in the Final SEA that a portion of the money collected through
24 the mitigation fee program will be used to offset forgone emissions reductions, but concluded that as

25 proposals for how to spend the mitigation fees have not yet been evaluated, there were currently no

26 feasible mitigation measures that would eliminate or reduce the significant adverse operational air

27 quality impacts for NOx emissions to less than significant levels if 2018 PAR 1111 was adopted.

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR FIRST AMENDED WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;
CASE NO. BS173018

37. The Final SEA continues to discuss a forthcoming rebate program, which will be

2 partially funded through the collected mitigation fees. The District describes the rebate program as

3 "separate from the rule amendment," despite the fact that the rebate is discussed repeatedly in the

4 Final SEA.

5 38. Despite the changes to the text of 2018 PAR 1111 and the significant changes in the

6 environmental analysis, the District concluded that the Final SEA did not need to be circulated for

7 public comment.

8 39. The Final SEA was not released for public comment before the District's March 2,
9 12018 board meeting.

10 40. In March 2018, the District released its Final Staff Report for 2018 PAR 1111.

11 41. The section of the Final Staff Report discussing CEQA (pages 3-2 through 3-4) is new.

12 The old text is entirely in strikethrough.

13 42. In the Final Staff Report, the District again stated that any changes to 2018 PAR 1111

14 and it associated environmental analysis did not require the recirculation of the CEQA document for

15 public comment.

16 43. The Final Staff Report also discusses the rebate program, but states that the "rebate

17 program is not part of the proposed rule requirements."

18 44. On March 2, 2018, the District adopted 2018 PAR 1111.

19 45. On March 5, 2018, the District filed its Notice of Determination ("NOD") for the

20 adoption of 2018 PAR 1111.

21 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

22 46. This action arises under the following laws:

STANDING

2 56. JCI has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition/Complaint because it is an

3 entity to which the adopted regulation applies. JCI manufactures, sells, and distributes residential

4 furnaces within the geographic territory administered by the District and those residential furnaces are

5 subject to the District's rules and regulations. JCI's environmental, economic, and beneficial interests

6 are directly and adversely affected by the District's adoption of 2018 PAR 1111. JCI will sustain

7 direct harm and a injury-in-fact as a result of the District's actions because 2018 PAR 1111 will have a

8 direct, immediate, and adverse impact on JCI's operations and business. That injury is imminent

9 because the Board adopted 2018 PAR 1111 on March 2, 2018 and JCI will be required to pay the

10 increased fee on the sale of any non-compliant furnace sold in the District. This Court has the power

11 to remedy and harm and injury caused by the District's actions by granting JCI the relief requested

12 herein.

13 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

14 (Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act; Inadequate and Incomplete Analysis)

15 57. Petitioner/Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference, as though fully set forth
16 herein, the allegations contained above in Paragraphs 1 - 56, inclusive.

17 58. Petitioner/Plaintiff brings this First Cause of Action pursuant to Public Resources Code

18 § 21168 and § 21168.5, on the grounds that the District failed to act in accordance with the law and

19 committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion, in that it considered and approved 2018 PAR 1111
20 without undertaking an analysis of the potentially adverse significant environmental impacts as

21 required by CEQA.

22 59. The District is a "Public Agency" within the meaning of CEQA. Pub. Res. Code §

23 21063; CEQA Guidelines § 15383. CEQA requires public agencies to conduct environmental review

24 prior to approving any discretionary project that may have a significant impact on the environment.

25 The District's approval of 2018 PAR 1111 is a discretionary approval.

26 60. Under CEQA, "Project" means "the whole of an action, which has the potential for

27 resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect

28 physical change in the environment." CEQA Guidelines § 15378(a).

61. The District's approval of 2018 PAR 1111 constitutes a "Project" within the meaning

2 of CEQA.

3 62. "Approval" of a project means "the decision by a public agency which commits the

4 agency to a definite course of action in regard to a project intended to be carried out by any person."

5 Guidelines § 15352. The District's actions related to its adoption of 2018 PAR 1111 constitute an

6 "approval" within the meaning of CEQA.

7 63. Compliance with the procedural requirements of CEQA informs the public of the

8 proposed project and aids in identifying project alternatives and mitigation measures. These

9 procedural requirements (and the project alternatives and mitigation measures they identify) further

10 CEQA's purpose of reducing the potential for either a direct or a reasonably foresecable indirect

11 physical change in the environment. Without a proper procedural foundation, a public agency cannot

12 comply with CEQA's mandate to approve projects as proposed only if there are no feasible

13 alternatives or feasible mitigation measures available which would substantially lessen the significant

14 environmental effects of such projects. Pub. Res. Code § 21102.

15 64. If there is any possibility that a discretionary project being considered for approval by a
16 public agency may have the potential for resulting in a direct or reasonably foreseeable indirect

17 significant effect on the environment, the agency must comply with CEQA. Pub. Res. Code § 21080.

18 65. The District committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to comply with
19 CEQA when it failed to conduct an adequate investigation of the impacts of 2018 PAR 1111. The
20 District prepared a Draft SEA and analyzed the potentially significant environmental impacts of 2017

21 PAR 1111. However, after the SEA was released to the public, the District later changed the fee

22 schedule and released a different proposed amendment to Rule 1111-Draft 2018 PAR 1111. The

23 District released a Final SEA, but the Final SEA analyzed yet another version of 2018 PAR 1111.

24 The Final SEA failed to analyze the environmental impacts of 2018 PAR 1111 in critical ways, but

25 the District adopted 2018 PAR 11111.

26 66. The District also failed to comply with CEQA by undermining the public's ability to
27 provide comments and fully participate in the development of 2018 PAR 1111. The text of Draft

28 2018 PAR 1111 was released on January 30, 2018 in conjunction with the release of the District's
11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR FIRST AMENDED WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
CASE NO. BS173018

F Staff Report. Staff Reports do not have public comment periods, SO the District did not provide an

2 opportunity to comment on the text of the rule amendment the District ultimately adopted.

3 67. The text of 2018 PAR 1111 was released just days before the Board Hearing and never

4 put out for public comment.

5 68. For the reasons stated above. the District's adoption of 2018 PAR 1111 failed to

6 comply with CEQA. 2018 PAR 1111 will have significant economic, operational, and other impacts

7 on Petitioner/Plaintiff. Petitioner/Plaintiff has no other plain, speedy, or adequate legal remedy for

8 this harm and seeks appropriate relief through this Petition and Complaint.

0 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

10 (Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act; Failure to Recirculate the Final SEA)

11 69. Petitioner/Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference, as though fully set forth

12 herein, the allegations contained above in Paragraphs 1- 68, inclusive.

13 70. Petitioner/Plaintiff brings this Second Cause of Action pursuant to California Code of

14 Regulations sections 15073.5 and 15088.5, on the grounds that the District failed to recirculate its

15 environmental analysis for public comment.

16 71. After circulating the Draft SEA for public comment, the District modified the text of its

17 proposed rule amendments and also changed its environmental analysis. The revised Draft SEA

18 (which became the Final SEA) was never circulated for public comment.

19 72. The District concluded that the revisions of the amendments to Rule 1111 would not

20 create new, avoidable significant impacts and that the new information in the environmental analysis

21 was not of substantial importance relative to the draft document. As a result, the District did not

22 circulate the text of 2018 PAR 1111 actually adopted and its associated environmental analysis for

23 public comment.

24 73. At a minimum, the District should have recirculated the CEQA portion of the Final

25 SEA for public comment. The analysis of the environmental impacts, including the cumulative

26 impacts, was substantially different than the Draft SEA. The decision not to recirculate the Final SEA

27 was not supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record.

28
12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR FIRST AMENDED WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;
CASE NO. BS173018

1 74. For the reasons stated above, the District's adoption of 2018 PAR 1111 failed to

2 comply with CEQA. 2018 PAR 1111 will have significant economic, operational, and other impacts

3 on Petitioner/Plaintiff. Petitioner/Plaintiff has no other plain, speedy, or adequate legal remedy for

4 this harm and seeks appropriate relief through this Petition and Complaint.

5 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

6 (Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act; Improper Piecemealing)

7 75. Petitioner/Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference, as though fully set forth

8 herein, the allegations contained above in Paragraphs 1- 74, inclusive.

0 76. Petitioner/Plaintiff brings this Third Cause of Action pursuant to Public Resources

10 § Code § 21168 and § 21168.5, on the grounds that the District failed to act in accordance with the law

11 and committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion, in that it considered and approved rules without

12 undertaking an analysis of the potential environmental impacts as required by CEQA.

13 77. The District's approval of 2018 PAR 1111 constitutes a "Project" within the meaning

14 of CEQA, although the analysis of the rule's environmental impacts was improperly segmented and
15 conducted separately from the impacts of the forthcoming "companion" rebate program.

16 78. The regulation of the emissions of NOx from residential furnaces, including both the
17 mitigation fee and the forthcoming rebate program, constitutes a "Project" within the meaning of

18 CEQA. CEQA requires the Lead Agency to analyze "the whole of an action."

19 79. The District previously treated the mitigation fee and the rebate together, as evidenced
20 by the fact that both were handled together in previous rulemakings. In the text of 2017 PAR 1111,

21 Draft 2018 PAR 1111, and 2018 PAR 1111, the section of Rule 1111 titled "Rebate Incentives for

22 Early Compliance" is in strikethrough, showing that the District was removing the previous rebate

23 program from Rule 1111 while simultaneously stating a that a new rebate program was separate

24 action.

25 80. Additionally, the District has made several statements indicating that the mitigation fee

26 and the forthcoming rebate program are integrally related. In the Draft Staff Report, the District

27 described the rebate as a "companion of the rule amendment." On March 28, 2018, the District held

28 working group meeting to discuss further amending Rule 1111 to add "labeling requirements to Rule
13
VERIFIED PETITION FOR FIRST AMENDED WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF:
CASE NO. BS173018

1111 for any non-compliant unit" sold in the District and to discuss "Rule 1111 rebate program

2 implementation."

81. The District has also provided public notice of a public consultation meeting to present

4 and solicit information and suggestions from the public about these future amendments to Rule 1111.
District Staff determined "that it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility that the

6 proposed amendments to Rule 1111 may have a significant adverse effect on the environment" and

7 thus the future rulemaking is exempt from CEQA.

8 82. The Final Staff Report and the Final SEA continue to discuss the rebate program in

9 conjunction with 2018 PAR 1111 and as its "companion" while simultaneously stating that the rebate

10 program is "not part of the proposed rule requirements.

11 83. The District committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to comply with

12 CEQA when it failed to conduct an adequate investigation of the impacts of 2018 PAR 1111 by

13 excluding from its analysis the potential environmental impacts of the forthcoming rebate program.

14 The District improperly and invalidly segmented its analysis. The potentially significant

15 environmental impacts of 2018 PAR 1111 and the rebate program should not be piecemealed. The

16 District failed to comply with CEQA and committed an abuse of discretion by not analyzing the

17 impacts of 2018 PAR 1111 and the rebate program as a single "project." a

18 84. For the reasons stated above, the District's adoption of 2018 PAR 1111 failed to

19 comply with CEQA. 2018 PAR 1111 will have significant economic, operational, and other impacts

20 on Petitioner/Plaintiff. Petitioner/Plaintiff has no other plain, speedy, or adequate legal remedy for

21 this harm and seek appropriate relief through this Petition and Complaint.

22 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

23 (Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act; Failure to Analyze Adequate Mitigation
24 Measures)

25 85. Petitioner/Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference, as though fully set forth
26 herein, the allegations contained above in Paragraphs - 84 inclusive.

27 86. If significant adverse environmental impacts are identified, CEQA requires the Lead

28 Agency to analyze measures that could either avoid or substantially reduce any adverse environmental
14
VERIFIED PETITION FOR FIRST AMENDED WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;
CASE NO. BS173018

1 impacts to the greatest extent feasible. CEQA Guidelines § 15126.4.

2 87. The District concluded that 2017 PAR 1111 would have significant adverse operational

3 air quality impacts. The District was thus required to analyze how to mitigate those air quality

4 impacts.

5 88. The District stated in the Draft SEA that there were no feasible mitigation measures to

6 mitigate the excess NOx from non-compliant furnaces, and only analyzed imposing a "mitigation" fee

7 of various amounts that would be available for general revenue purposes, including the companion

8 rebate program, of the District.

89. The District concluded that 2018 PAR 1111 would have significant adverse operational

10 air quality impacts. The District was thus required to analyze how to mitigate those air quality

11 impacts.

12 90. The District stated in the Final SEA that "there are no feasible mitigation measures that

13 would eliminate or reduce the significant adverse operational air quality impacts for NOx emissions to

14 less than significant levels[.]"

15 91. There are mitigation measures, however, available to actually mitigate adverse air

16 quality impacts from the sale of non-compliant NOx furnaces, and the District is required to analyze

17 them and impose them as conditions of the approval of the Project.

18 92. Additionally, although the District has labeled the fee imposed as a "mitigation fee,"

19 the District has expressly stated that the fee does not mitigate the adverse environmental impacts from
20 the sale of non-compliant furnaces in the District. The District has thus failed to justify the need for

21 this "mitigation fee" and how it mitigates the adverse impacts of 2018 PAR 1111. The "mitigation

22 fee" fails to serve as a mitigation measure that the District is required to identify and consider in

23 response to its finding that the Rule would have a significant adverse air quality impact.

24 93. For the reasons stated above, the District's adoption of 2018 PAR 1111 failed to

25 comply with CEQA. 2018 PAR 1111 will have significant economic, operational, and other impacts

26 on Petitioner/Plaintiff. Petitioner/Plaintiff has no other plain, speedy, or adequate legal remedy for
27 this harm and seek appropriate relief through this Petition and Complaint.

FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act and District Rule 110(e); Inadequate

3 and Incomplete Analysis of Alternatives)

4 94. Petitioner/Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference, as though fully set forth

5 herein, the allegations contained above in Paragraphs 1- 93, inclusive.

6 95. The District is required to develop and analyze a reasonable range of alternatives, and

7 that range "shall include [alternatives] that could feasibly accomplish most of the basic objectives of

8 the project and could avoid or substantially lessen one or more of the significant effects." 14 C.C.R. §

9 15126.6(c).

10 96. District Rule 110(e) also requires an analysis of alternatives and "[a]ny action or

11 proposal for which significant adverse environmental impacts have been identified during the review

12 process shall not be approved or adopted as proposed if there are feasible mitigation measures or

13 feasible alternatives available which would substantially reduce such adverse impact."

14 97. In the Draft SEA, the District failed to develop and analyze a reasonable range of

15 alternatives. The District analyzed 2017 PAR 1111, a "no project" alternative, and three other

16 alternatives. However, the alternatives are all variations on the same concept: revising the NOx

17 emissions limit under the rule and charging various fee amounts for a set amount of time.

18 98. In the Final SEA, the District failed to develop and analyze a reasonable range of

19 alternatives. The District analyzed 2018 PAR 1111, a "no project" alternative, and three other

20 Il alternatives. However, the alternatives are all variations on the same concept: revising the NOx

21 emissions limit under the rule and charging various fee amounts for a set amount of time.

22 99. The District did not analyze any other alternative ways of regulating NOx emissions

23 from furnaces and mitigating the environmental impacts. For example, the District did not analyze

24 using an actual mitigation fee to fund an offset program.

25 100. The District's decision to curtail its alternatives analysis is particularly problematic as
26 the District admitted that the no feasible mitigation measures are available that would eliminate or

27 reduce the significant adverse operational air quality impacts for NOx emissions if 2018 PAR 1111

28 was implemented.
16
VERIFIED PETITION FOR FIRST AMENDED WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;
CASE NO. BS173018

101. For the reasons stated above, the District's adoption of 2018 PAR 1111 failed to

2 comply with CEQA. 2018 PAR 1111 will have significant economic, operational, and other impacts
on Petitioner/Plaintiff. Petitioner/Plaintiff has no other plain, speedy, or adequate legal remedy for

4 this harm and seek appropriate relief through this Petition and Complaint.
SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

(Violation of California Environmental Quality Act, Failure to Analyze Cumulative Impacts and Associated Mitigation Measures)

102. Petitioner/Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference, as though fully set forth

9 herein, the allegations contained above in Paragraphs 1-101, inclusive.

10 103. The District is required to analyze the cumulative impacts of 2018 PAR 1111. 14 CCR

11 §§ 15065(a)(3); 15064(h)(1). The District purports to rely on previously approved documents to

12 satisfy the discussion of cumulative impacts without identifying which documents upon which the

13 Districts relies.

14 104. Furthermore, the District states that implementation of "other" control measures in its

15 2017 Air Quality Management Plan will reduce exposures to existing NOx emissions, without

16 identifying the relevant control measures.

17 105. The District's cumulative impacts analysis was therefore conclusory and insufficient.

are 18 106. The District also concluded that "no cumulative mitigation measures for operation
19 required." As the cumulative impact analysis in the Final SEA was conclusory and insufficient, the
20 associated discussion and analysis of cumulative mitigation measures was also conclusory.

21 107. For the reasons stated above, the District's adoption of 2018 PAR 1111 failed to

22 comply with CEQA. 2018 PAR 1111 will have significant economic, operational, and other impacts

23 on Petitioner/Plaintiff. Petitioner/Plaintiff has no other plain, speedy, or adequate legal remedy for
24 this harm and seek appropriate relief through this Petition and Complaint.

I SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act, Health & Safety Code, and California

3 APA for Failure to Disclose Regulatory Provisions to the Public in Advance of Adoption)

4 108. Petitioner/Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference, as though fully set forth

5 herein, the allegations contained above in Paragraphs 1- 107, inclusive.

6 109. The text of Draft 2018 PAR 1111 was released on January 30, 2018, and there was no

7 public comment period provided for Draft 2018 PAR 1111. The public comment period for the Draft

8 SEA, which analyzed a different proposal, closed on February 9, 2018 -less than two weeks after

0 Draft 2018 PAR 1111 was released.

10 110. After the public comment period closed for the Draft SEA, the District made further

11 amendments the proposed rule text. The District released 2018 PAR 1111 and the Final SEA only

12 days before the Board's public meeting where 2018 PAR 1111 was adopted.

13 111. The District did not provide a public comment period for 2018 PAR 1111 and the Final

14 SEA.

15 112. The District should have provided additional time for the public to review new 2018

16 PAR 1111 and meaningfully participate in the District's deliberative process relating to these

17 provisions.

18 113. The District's actions violate the California APA, Government Code § 11340 et seq., §

19 by failing to inform the public and provide an opportunity to comment in advance of adopting
20 provisions that will directly impact the regulated comment. California Government Code co.

21 11346.8(c) prohibits adopting regulations that have been changed from the version originally made

22 available to the public, unless the change is nonsubstantial or sufficiently related to the original

23 proposal to put the public on notice of the potential change. Here, 2018 PAR 1111 varies significantly

24 from 2017 PAR 1111 because the fee structure, amounts, and duration have all changed. 2018 PAR

25 1111 also varies from Draft 2018 PAR 1111 because the duration of the fees has changed for some

26 furnaces and an exemption for propane furnaces has been added. These changes significantly impact

27 the regulated community.

28
18
VERIFIED PETITION FOR FIRST AMENDED WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;
CASE NO. BS173018

1 114. The District's actions also violate the Health & Safety Code. Specifically, H&SC

2 section 40725 requires the District to provide at least 30 days' prior notice of any proposed new or

3 amended regulations; that notice must include a copy of the proposed rule, a summary description of

4 the effect of the rule, and an invitation to public comment.
115. 2018 PAR 1111 is substantially different than 2017 PAR 1111, and the District did not
6 comply with these notice requirements before adopting 2018 PAR 1111.

116. Additionally, the District's actions violate Public Resources Code § 21092 because the

8 District obtained significant new information and revised the proposed rule amendments without

o providing a new notice to the public. 2018 PAR 1111 is substantially different than 2017 PAR 1111,

10 and the District failed to comply with these notice requirements.

11 117. The District's adoption of 2018 PAR 1111 will have significant economic, operational,

12 and other impacts on Petitioner/Plaintiff. Petitioner/Plaintiff has no other plain, speedy, or adequate

13 legal remedy for this harm and seeks appropriate relief through this Petition and Complaint.

14 EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (2018 PAR 1111 Constitutes an Illegal Tax; Health and Safety Code section 40727)

16 118. Petitioner/Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference, as though fully set forth
17 herein, the allegations contained above in Paragraphs 1- 117, inclusive.

18 119. 2018 PAR 1111 requires OEMs who sell non-compliant furnaces in the District to pay

19 mitigation fee.

20 120. This fee established by 2018 PAR 1111 is a tax, and not a regulatory fee. The primary

21 purpose of the fee is to generate revenue, as evidenced by the fact that the revenue from the fee will be

22 used to, among other possible general uses, fund the rebate program, which the District has

23 "separately" authorized..

24 121. The fee was not passed by a two-thirds supermajority, and thus is illegal. California

25 Constitution Article XIII A, Section 3.

26 122. Additionally, the District's adoption of this mitigation fee violates Health & Safety

27 Code section 40727 because the District lacks authority to adopt it.

28 123. The District's adoption of 2018 PAR 1111 will have significant economic, operational,
19
VERIFIED PETITION FOR FIRST AMENDED WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF: CASE NO. BS173018

and other impacts on Petitioner/Plaintiff. Petitioner/Plaintiff has no other plain, speedy, or adequate

2 legal remedy for this harm and seeks appropriate relief through this Petition and Complaint.

3 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

4 WHEREFORE, Petitioner/Plaintiff prays for judgment and further relief as follows:

5 1. For a peremptory writ of mandate invalidating and vacating the adoption of 2018 PAR

6 1111 and ordering the District to:

7 a. Vacate and set aside the Final SEA prepared for 2018 PAR 1111;

8 b. Vacate and set aside the NOD for 2018 PAR 1111;

0 C. Prepare, circulate, and consider a new legally adequate CEQA analysis for 2018

10 PAR 1111, which includes an analysis of the companion rebate program,

11 provide a public comment period, respond to all comments received, consider

12 all necessary or appropriate amendments, and hold a board hearing to consider

13 adopting any necessary or appropriate amendments to Rule 1111 based on the

14 legally adequate CEQA analysis;

15 d. Comply with the requirements of the Health & Safety Code in these or any

16 related rulemaking proceedings; and

17 e. Any other peremptory writ relief the Court determines is necessary under Pub.

18 Res. Code § 21168.9.

19 2. For declaratory relief declaring that the District violated CEQA;

20 3. For declaratory relief declaring that the issuance of the Final SEA and NOD for 2018

21 PAR 1111 was unlawful, null, void, and unenforceable;

22 4. For declaratory relief declaring that the District lacks authority to impose the

23 mitigation fee for the purpose of generating revenue for unspecified District programs including,

24 without limitation the rebate program, and for injunctive relief enjoining the assessment of the

25 mitigation fee;

Matt,

JCI still intends to file an amended writ and complaint, but it has taken longer to get the filing finalized than anticipated when I emailed last week. We intend to file on Tuesday, June 26. As stated below, we view the amended filing as providing the District 30 days to answer from the time it is filed. We will email the District a copy of the amended filing
the day it is filed.

Thanks,
Kaitlyn

Subject: JCI v. South Coast

Matt,

After reviewing the administrative record, JCI intends to amend its writ and complaint, and wanted to provide the District notice of this as soon as possible. We intend to file the amended writ/complaint on Friday, June 22. These amendments will be focused on amending the CEQA causes of action, and we will not be adding new, non-CEQA causes of action. To be clear, we will be & retaining Counts Five & Six, which arise under other statutory sections and the CA
Constitution, but we will not add new, non-CEQA counts.

We do not see this amendment as impacting the scope of the administrative record as the writ is still challenging the adoption of amendments to Rule 1111. Our first stipulation allows the District to file its responsive pleading 30-days after the record is certified. We view the amended writ/complaint as providing the District a new 30-day period to respond (so 30 days from June 22). If the District would like to amend the stipulation to make clear that the 30-days will run from the amended writ/complaint, we would be happy to do that.

Thanks,
Kaitlyn

CEQA CASE

19 1. In this verified Petition for First Amended Writ of Mandate, Petitioner/Plaintiff
20 Johnson Controls, Inc. ("JCI*) asks this Court to invalidate certain actions of Respondent/Defendant,

21 the South Coast Air Quality Management District (*District"), including the District's preparation of
22 environmental documents under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") and the
23 adoption of amendments to Rule 1111 based on the environmental document prepared. JCI asks this

24 Court to invalidate the March 2, 2018 amendments to Rule 1111 and order the District to perform a

25 new environmental analysis that is consistent with CEQA, including the preparation of a new
26 environmental document, providing a comment period, and holding a public hearing where all
27 necessary or appropriate amendments are heard, and for this court to retain jurisdiction while the
28 District complies with its statutory obligations.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR FIRST AMENDED WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEE;
CASE No. BS173018

1 2. The District's CEQA analysis was procedurally and substantively deficient. As

2 explained in detail in this First Amended Writ and Complaint, the District prepared an environmental

3 document analyzing the impacts of a different set of amendments to Rule 111l than the District

4 actually proposed for adoption, and then, in response to comments, the District materially revised its

5 environmental analysis but did not circulate its environmental analysis for public comment. The

6 District concluded in its revised environmental analysis that the proposed project will have significant

7 adverse operational air impacts and that these impacts could not be mitigated - without assessing

8 possible mitigation measures - and then imposed a "mitigation fee" to fund a "separate" rebate

9 program that was not analyzed as a mitigation measure in the environmental analysis. Furthermore,

10 the District improperly piecemealed its CEQA analysis by excluding the integrally related rebate

11 program - a program the District expressly stated was a "companion" to the Project - from its

12 analysis. The District also improperly analyzed the cumulative impacts of the proposed rule
13 amendments. The District also lacks authority to impose a "mitigation" fee for the purpose of

14 generating general revenue for the District. For these reasons and for all the reasons identified herein,

15 the District's actions violated CEQA and this Court should invalidate the amendments to Rule 1111

16 and direct the District to conduct a new, compliant CEQA analysis, including providing a public

17 comment period and holding a hearing, and analyzing the impacts, alternatives, and mitigation

18 measures for amendments to Rule 1111.

19 INTRODUCTION

20 3. The District's Rule 1111 regulates the emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) from

21 residential furnaces. On March 2, 2018, the District adopted amendments to Rule 1111. This writ and

22 complaint challenges the legal adequacy of District's environmental analysis and the ability of the

23 district to impose a general revenue fee.

24 4. As explained more fully herein, the amendments imposed a new fee on the sale of non-

25 compliant furnaces. The District has amended Rule 1111 several times and has repeatedly set

26 ambitious NOx emissions rates, which furnace manufacturers have been unable to achieve. The

27 District has permitted non-compliant furnaces to be sold in the District if the manufacturer paid a

28 "mitigation fee" on the sale of each non-compliant furnace. Among other things, the recent
2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR FIRST AMENDED WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF:
CASE NO. BS173018

T amendments to Rule 1111 establish the amount of the fee.

2 5. The District failed to perform a CEQA-compliant environmental review before

3 adopting the amendments to Rule 1111.

4 6. CEQA requires public agencies to analyze potentially significant environmental

5 impacts of proposed projects and a range of reasonable alternatives and to identify and implement

6 mitigation for significant impacts. CEQA further requires that the public be made aware of the

7 project, the potential impacts and mitigation to allow for public comments. The Lead Agency is to

8 review and respond to the public comments and provide all of this information to the agency decision-

9 makers and the public. The District failed to comply with CEQA by (1) failing to analyze the version

10 of Rule 1111 that the District adopted and not properly analyzing the potential significant

11 environmental impacts of amendments to Rule 1111; (2) segmenting its analysis to exclude a
12 forthcoming rebate program; (3) failing to analyze potential mitigation measures; (4) failing to
13 analyze an adequate range of alternatives; (5) failing to adequately analyze cumulative impacts; and
14 (6) failing to circulate the final environmental analysis for public comment. Additionally, the District

15 lacks authority to impose the fee established by Rule 1111. The District's justification for the
16 imposition of a "mitigation fee" is insufficient, as the District stated that the potentially adverse

17 environmental impacts arising from the sale of non-complying furnaces "cannot be mitigated."
18 Therefore, the District is imposing a "mitigation" fee that has the primary purpose of generating

19 revenue and therefore is improper. The fundamental purposes of CEQA-public participation and an
20 assessment of potentially significant environmental impacts of a proposed project-have been

21 defeated by the District's actions.

22 PARTIES

23 7. JCI is multinational company with its domestic principal place of business in
24 Milwaukee, Wisconsin that manufacturers furnaces that are sold within the District that are regulated
25 by Rule 1111.

26 8. JCI participated in the rulemaking process for Rule 1111 and submitted comments

27 during the public comment period.

28 9. Respondent/Defendant South Coast Air Quality Management District is a state Public

- Agency located in Southern California.

2 10. The District's jurisdiction includes all of Orange County, the urban portions of Los

3 Angeles and San Bernardino Counties southwest of the San Bernardino and San Gabriel mountains,

4 and nearly all of Riverside County.

5 11. Petitioner/Plaintiff is unaware of the true names and capacities of

6 Respondents/Defendants identified as Does 1-20, and sues such Respondents/Defendants herein by

7 fictitious names. Petitioner/Plaintiff is informed and believes, and on that basis, alleges that

8 Respondents/Defendants Does 1-20 are also responsible, in whole or in part, for the District's failure

9 to comply with required rulemaking procedures and applicable state laws. When the true identifies

10 and capacities of these Respondents/Defendants have been determined, Petitioner/Plaintiff will, with

11 leave of the Court if necessary, amend this Petition and Complaint to insert such identifies and

12 capacities.

13 REGULATORY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

14 12. The District's Rule 1111 - Reduction of NOx Emissions from Natural-Gas-Fired, Fan-

15 Type Central Furnaces - was adopted in December 1978 and has been amended several times.

16 13. In November 2009, Rule 1111 was amended to establish a more stringent NOx

17 emission limit of 14 nanograms per joule (ng/J), and required the four major categories of residential

18 furnaces - condensing (high efficiency), non-condensing (standard), weatherized, and mobile home

19 heating units - to meet the emission limit by specific dates.

20 14. In these same amendments to Rule 1111, the District also created a financial incentive

21 - a rebate program within Rule 1111 - for manufacturers to achieve early compliance with the 14 ng/J
22 NOx emission. Manufacturers that delivered and sold compliant furnaces were eligible to receive a

23 rebate payment from the District. The District allocated 3 million dollars for this rebate incentive.

24 15. Original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") were unable to meet the NOx emissions

25 limits established in 2009, and Rule 1111 allowed OEMs to sell non-compliant furnaces if the OEM

26 paid a mitigation fee to the District. All OEMs had been selling non-compliant furnaces and

27 submitting mitigation fees to the District.

CASE NO. BS173018

t 16.

2 In September 2014, the District amended Rule 1111 again to delay the compliance
dates for the emission limit of 14 ng/J for all four categories of furnaces.

3 17.

4 The 2014 amendments retained both the mitigation fee and the rebate program
incentive for manufacturers in Rule 1111.

18.

6 In 2017, the District decided to amend Rule 1111 again because some OEMs stated
that they could now manufacture furnaces that achieved the 14ng/J standard.

19.

8 In October 2017, the District prepared Proposed Amended Rule 1111 ("2017 PAR

9 1111"), which would extend the compliance date for the four categories of furnaces to achieve

10 compliance with 14 ng/J while also increasing the mitigation fee for non-compliant furnaces.

11 Importantly, and for the first time, 2017 PAR 1111 deleted the Rule 1111 rebate program and

12 proposed separating it into a separate, but "linked" program of the District. 2017 PAR 1111 also

13 would increase the mitigation fee from $150 for each non condensing, weatherized, or mobile home

14 furnace and $200 for each condensing furnace to $400 for all non-compliant furnaces to pay for, in

15 part, the now piecemealed rebate program, and extend the dates for complying with the NOx limit for
all four categories of furnaces:

16 a. October 1, 2019 for condensing furnaces;

17 b. October 1, 2019 for non-condensing furnaces;

18 c. October 1, 2020 for weatherized furnaces; and

19 d. October 1, 2022 for mobile home furnaces.

20 20.

21 In December 2017, the District released a Draft Subsequent Environmental Assessment

22 (*Draft SEA") to evaluate the potential adverse environmental impacts of adopting 2017 PAR 1111.

23 In the Draft SEA, the District acknowledged that 2017 PAR 1111 is considered a "project" under

24 CEQA and that it would create a rebate program, which is a "separate action" from the rule

25 amendment even though a rebate was formerly an integral part of Rule 1111.

21. In the Draft SEA, the District stated that, in addition to proposing a fee increase to
26 incentivize early conversion to it compliant furnaces, it may also institute a rebate program, "which is a
27

28 separate action from the rule amendment." Elsewhere in the Draft SEA, the District reiterated this by
stating: "A rebate program, separate from the rule amendment, is also proposed."
5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR FIRST AMENDED WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;
CASE NO. BS173018

22. On January 9, 2018, the District hosted a Working Group meeting to discuss the

2 proposed amendments to Rule 1111. The PowerPoint prepared for the Working Group meeting

3 contained a different mitigation fee schedule than the fee schedule included in 2017 PAR 1111 and

4 analyzed in the Draft SEA. In the Working Group meeting, the District proposed a two-phased

5 "mitigation" fee and subdividing the four categories of furnaces into subcategories based on size. The

6 fee imposed on the sale of non-complying furnaces would vary based upon the equipment category,

7 the equipment size, and when the unit was sold, until the fees were eventually phased out.

23. The PowerPoint presentation given at the Working Group meeting also discussed

9 creating a rebate program.

10 24. On January 30, 2018, the District released its Draft Staff Report and a new version of

11 the Proposed Amendment to Rule 1111 ("Draft 2018 PAR 1111"). The fee schedule in Draft 2018

12 PAR 1111 is the same as what was discussed in the Working Group meeting. However, Draft 2018

13 PAR 1111 varied in significant ways from 2017 PAR 1111.

14 25. In the Draft Staff Report, the District again acknowledged the creation of a rebate

15 program: 'As a companion of the rule amendment, staff has also proposed to establish a rebate

16 program for consumers who purchase and install compliant furnaces in the [District] to benefit
17 consumers and incentivize the purchase of lower emitting compliant furnaces."

18 26. The Draft SEA was published before the District released the text of Draft 2018 PAR

19 1111.

20 27. The Draft Staff Report discusses Draft 2018 PAR 1111, but is not an environmental

21 document under CEQA and the Draft Staff Report does not analyze the potentially significant

22 environmental impacts of Draft 2018 PAR 1111.

23 28. The District did not provide a new public comment period when it released Draft 2018

24 PAR 1111.

25 29. On February 9, 2018, JCI submitted written comments during the Draft SEA's public

26 comment period, that questioned the deficiencies of the Draft SEA and the significant differences

27 between 2017 PAR 1111 and Draft 2018 PAR 1111.

28 30. In late February 2018, the District released a Final Subsequent Environmental
6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR FIRST AMENDED WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;
CASE NO. BS173018

Assessment ("Final SEA"). The Final SEA analyzed yet another version of amendments to Rule 1111

2 (*2018 PAR 1111").

3 31. In 2018 PAR 1111, the District retained the two-phased mitigation fee schedule

4 established in Draft 2018 PAR 1111, but changed the Phase One Mitigation Fee Start Date for

5 condensing furnaces. The District also removed the alternative compliance extension option for

6 mobile home units.

7 32. In contrast to Draft 2018 PAR 1111, 2018 PAR 1111 provided an exemption of rule

8 applicability for natural gas furnaces to be installed with propane conversion kits for propane firing

9 only.

10 33. In the Final SEA, the District again acknowledged that the amendments to Rule 1111 is

11 a "project" under CEQA that would cause significant air quality impacts.

12 34. The District made substantial changes in the Final SEA from the Draft SEA in the

13 sections discussing the proposed project and the project's environmental impacts. For example, the

14 District prepared a substantially revised analysis of the cumulative environmental impacts and

15 mitigation measures for 2018 PAR 1111. The District generally referred back to discussions of

16 cumulative impacts "in one or more previously certified EIRs" as "incorporated by reference," but did

17 not identify which EIRs upon which the District was relying.

18 35. In the Final SEA, the District concluded that the project would cause significant air

19 quality impacts but that cumulative air quality impacts are not expected to be significant because
20 implementation of other control measures is expected to result in net emission reductions and overall
21 air quality improvement. The District further concluded that no cumulative mitigation measures for

22 operation are required.

23 36. The District also stated in the Final SEA that a portion of the money collected through
24 the mitigation fee program will be used to offset forgone emissions reductions, but concluded that as
25 proposals for how to spend the mitigation fees have not yet been evaluated, there were currently no

26 feasible mitigation measures that would eliminate or reduce the significant adverse operational air
27 quality impacts for NOx emissions to less than significant levels if 2018 PAR 1111 was adopted.

CASE NO. BS173018

37. The Final SEA continues to discuss forthcoming rebate program, which will be

2 partially funded through the collected mitigation fees. The District describes the rebate program as

3 "separate from the rule amendment," despite the fact that the rebate is discussed repeatedly in the

4 Final SEA.

5 38. Despite the changes to the text of 2018 PAR 1111 and the significant changes in the

6 environmental analysis, the District concluded that the Final SEA did not need to be circulated for

7 public comment.

8 39. The Final SEA was not released for public comment before the District's March 2,
9 2018 board meeting.

10 40. In March 2018, the District released its Final Staff Report for 2018 PAR 1111.

11 41. The section of the Final Staff Report discussing CEQA (pages 3-2 through 3-4) is new.

12 The old text is entirely in strikethrough.

13 42. In the Final Staff Report, the District again stated that any changes to 2018 PAR 1111

14 and it associated environmental analysis did not require the recirculation of the CEQA document for

15 public comment.

16 43. The Final Staff Report also discusses the rebate program, but states that the "rebate

17 program is not part of the proposed rule requirements."

18 44. On March 2, 2018, the District adopted 2018 PAR 1111.

19 45. On March 5, 2018, the District filed its Notice of Determination ("NOD") for the

20 adoption of 2018 PAR 1111.

21 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

22 46. This action arises under the following laws:

STANDING

2 56. JCI has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition/Complaint because it is an
entity to which the adopted regulation applies. JCI manufactures, sells, and distributes residential

4 furnaces within the geographic territory administered by the District and those residential furnaces are
subject to the District's rules and regulations. JCI's environmental, economic, and beneficial interests

6 are directly and adversely affected by the District's adoption of 2018 PAR 1111. JCI will sustain

7 direct harm and injury-in-fact as a result of the District's actions because 2018 PAR 1111 will have a

8 direct, immediate, and adverse impact on JCI's operations and business. That injury is imminent

9 because the Board adopted 2018 PAR 1111 on March 2, 2018 and JCI will be required to pay the

10 increased fee on the sale of any non-compliant furnace sold in the District. This Court has the power

11 to remedy and harm and injury caused by the District's actions by granting JCI the relief requested

12 herein.

13 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

14 (Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act; Inadequate and Incomplete Analysis)

15 57. Petitioner/Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference, as though fully set forth

16 herein, the allegations contained above in Paragraphs 1- 56, inclusive.

17 58. Petitioner/Plaintiff brings this First Cause of Action pursuant to Public Resources Code

18 O 21168 con and § 21168.5, on the grounds that the District failed to act in accordance with the law and

19 committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion, in that it considered and approved 2018 PAR 1111

20 without undertaking an analysis of the potentially adverse significant environmental impacts as

21 required by CEQA.

22 59. The District is a "Public Agency" within the meaning of CEQA. Pub. Res. Code §

23 21063; CEQA Guidelines § 15383. CEQA requires public agencies to conduct environmental review

24 prior to approving any discretionary project that may have a significant impact on the environment.

25 The District's approval of 2018 PAR 1111 is a discretionary approval.

26 60. Under CEQA, "Project" means "the whole of an action, which has the potential for

27 resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect

28 physical change in the environment." CEQA Guidelines 15378(a).
10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR FIRST AMENDED WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;
CASE NO. BS173018

61. The District's approval of 2018 PAR 1111 constitutes a "Project" within the meaning

2 of CEQA.

3 62. "Approval" of a project means "the decision by a public agency which commits the

4 agency to a definite course of action in regard to a project intended to be carried out by any person."

5 Guidelines § 15352. The District's actions related to its adoption of 2018 PAR 1111 constitute an

6 "approval" within the meaning of CEQA.

7 63. Compliance with the procedural requirements of CEQA informs the public of the

8 proposed project and aids in identifying project alternatives and mitigation measures. These
procedural requirements (and the project alternatives and mitigation measures they identify) further

10 CEQA's purpose of reducing the potential for either a direct or a reasonably foreseeable indirect

11 physical change in the environment. Without a proper procedural foundation, a public agency cannot

12 comply with CEQA's mandate to approve projects as proposed only if there are no feasible

13 alternatives or feasible mitigation measures available which would substantially lessen the significant
14 environmental effects of such projects. Pub. Res. Code § 21102.

15 64. If there is any possibility that a discretionary project being considered for approval by a

16 public agency may have the potential for resulting in a direct or reasonably foresecable indirect

17 significant effect on the environment, the agency must comply with CEQA. Pub. Res. Code § 21080.

18 65. The District committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to comply with

19 CEQA when it failed to conduct an adequate investigation of the impacts of 2018 PAR 1111. The
20 District prepared a Draft SEA and analyzed the potentially significant environmental impacts of 2017
21 PAR 1111. However, after the SEA was released to the public, the District later changed the fee

22 schedule and released a different proposed amendment to Rule 1111-Draft 2018 PAR 1111. The

23 District released a Final SEA, but the Final SEA analyzed yet another version of 2018 PAR 1111.

24 The Final SEA failed to analyze the environmental impacts of 2018 PAR 1111 in critical ways, but

25 the District adopted 2018 PAR 11111.

26 66. The District also failed to comply with CEQA by undermining the public's ability to

27 provide comments and fully participate in the development of 2018 PAR 1111. The text of Draft
28 2018 PAR 1111 was released on January 30, 2018 in conjunction with the release of the District's
11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR FIRST AMENDED WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;
CASE NO. BS173018

1 Staff Report. Staff Reports do not have public comment periods, so the District did not provide an

2 opportunity to comment on the text of the rule amendment the District ultimately adopted.

3 67. The text of 2018 PAR 1111 was released just days before the Board Hearing and never

4 put out for public comment.

5 68. For the reasons stated above, the District's adoption of 2018 PAR 1111 failed to

6 comply with CEQA. 2018 PAR 1111 will have significant economic, operational, and other impacts

7 on Petitioner/Plaintiff. Petitioner/Plaintiff has no other plain, speedy, or adequate legal remedy for

8 this harm and seeks appropriate relief through this Petition and Complaint.
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

10 (Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act; Failure to Recirculate the Final SEA)

11 69. Petitioner/Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference, as though fully set forth
12 herein, the allegations contained above in Paragraphs 1- 68, inclusive:

13 70. Petitioner/Plaintiff brings this Second Cause of Action pursuant to California Code of

14 Regulations sections 15073.5 and 15088.5, on the grounds that the District failed to recirculate its

15 environmental analysis for public comment.

16 71. After circulating the Draft SEA for public comment, the District modified the text of its

17 proposed rule amendments and also changed its environmental analysis. The revised Draft SEA

18 (which became the Final SEA) was never circulated for public comment.

19 72. The District concluded that the revisions of the amendments to Rule 1111 would not

20 create new, avoidable significant impacts and that the new information in the environmental analysis

21 was not of substantial importance relative to the draft document. As a result, the District did not

22 circulate the text of 2018 PAR 1111 actually adopted and its associated environmental analysis for

23 public comment.

24 73. At a minimum, the District should have recirculated the CEQA portion of the Final

25 SEA for public comment. The analysis of the environmental impacts, including the cumulative

26 impacts, was substantially different than the Draft SEA. The decision not to recirculate the Final SEA

27 was not supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record.

28
12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR FIRST AMENDED WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;
CASE NO. BS173018

- 74. For the reasons stated above, the District's adoption of 2018 PAR 1111 failed to

2 comply with CEQA. 2018 PAR 1111 will have significant economic, operational, and other impacts

3 on Petitioner/Plaintiff. Petitioner/Plaintiff has no other plain, speedy, or adequate legal remedy for

4 this harm and seeks appropriate relief through this Petition and Complaint.

5 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

6 (Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act; Improper Piecemealing)

7 75. Petitioner/Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference, as though fully set forth

8 herein, the allegations contained above in Paragraphs 1- 74, inclusive.

9 76. Petitioner/Plaintiff brings this Third Cause of Action pursuant to Public Resources

10 Code § 21168 and § 21168.5, on the grounds that the District failed to act in accordance with the law

11 and committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion, in that it considered and approved rules without

12 undertaking an analysis of the potential environmental impacts as required by CEQA.

13 77. The District's approval of 2018 PAR 1111 constitutes a "Project" within the meaning

14 of CEQA, although the analysis of the rule's environmental impacts was improperly segmented and
15 conducted separately from the impacts of the forthcoming "companion" rebate program.

16 78. The regulation of the emissions of NOx from residential furnaces, including both the

17 mitigation fee and the forthcoming rebate program, constitutes a "Project" within the meaning of

18 CEQA. CEQA requires the Lead Agency to analyze "the whole of an action."

19 79. The District previously treated the mitigation fee and the rebate together, as evidenced

20 by the fact that both were handled together in previous rulemakings. In the text of 2017 PAR 1111,
21 Draft 2018 PAR 1111, and 2018 PAR 1111, the section of Rule 1111 titled "Rebate Incentives for

22 Early Compliance" is in strikethrough, showing that the District was removing the previous rebate
program from Rule 1111 while simultaneously stating that a new rebate program was a separate 23

24 action.

25 80. Additionally, the District has made several statements indicating that the mitigation fee

26 and the forthcoming rebate program are integrally related. In the Draft Staff Report, the District
27 described the rebate as a "companion of the rule amendment." On March 28, 2018, the District held a

28 working group meeting to discuss further amending Rule 1111 to add "labeling requirements to Rule
13
VERIFIED PETITION FOR FIRST AMENDED WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;
CASE NO. BS173018

-

2 1111 for any non-compliant unit" sold in the District and to discuss "Rule 1111 rebate program
implementation."

3 81.

4 The District has also provided public notice of a public consultation meeting to present

5 and solicit information and suggestions from the public about these future amendments to Rule 1111.

6 District Staff determined "that it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility that the

7 proposed amendments to Rule 1111 may have a significant adverse effect on the environment" and
thus the future rulemaking is exempt from CEQA.

8 82.

9 The Final Staff Report and the Final SEA continue to discuss the rebate program in

10 conjunction with 2018 PAR 1111 and as its "companion" while simultaneously stating that the rebate
program is "not part of the proposed rule requirements.

11 83.

12 The District committed : prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to comply with

13 CEQA when it failed to conduct an adequate investigation of the impacts of 2018 PAR 1111 by

14 excluding from its analysis the potential environmental impacts of the forthcoming rebate program.

15 The District improperly and invalidly segmented its analysis. The potentially significant

16 environmental impacts of 2018 PAR 1111 and the rebate program should not be piecemealed. The

17 District failed to comply with CEQA and committed an abuse of discretion by not analyzing the

18 impacts of 2018 PAR 1111 and the rebate program as a single "project."

84.

19 For the reasons stated above, the District's adoption of 2018 PAR 1111 failed to

20 comply with CEQA. 2018 PAR 1111 will have significant economic, operational, and other impacts

21 on Petitioner/Plaintiff. Petitioner/Plaintiff has no other plain, speedy, or adequate legal remedy for

22 this harm and seek appropriate relief through this Petition and Complaint.
FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

23

24 (Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act; Failure to Analyze Adequate Mitigation
Measures)

25 85. Petitioner/Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference, as though fully set forth
26 herein, the allegations contained above in Paragraphs - 84 inclusive.

27 86.

28 If significant adverse environmental impacts are identified, CEQA requires the Lead
Agency to analyze measures that could either avoid or substantially reduce any adverse environmental
14
VERIFIED PETITION FOR FIRST AMENDED WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF;
CASE NO. BS173018

- impacts to the greatest extent feasible. CEQA Guidelines § 15126.4.

2 87. The District concluded that 2017 PAR 1111 would have significant adverse operational

3 air quality impacts. The District was thus required to analyze how to mitigate those air quality

4 impacts.

5 88. The District stated in the Draft SEA that there were no feasible mitigation measures to

6 mitigate the excess NOx from non-compliant furnaces, and only analyzed imposing a "mitigation" fee

7 of various amounts that would be available for general revenue purposes, including the companion

8 rebate program, of the District.

9 89. The District concluded that 2018 PAR 1111 would have significant adverse operational

10 air quality impacts. The District was thus required to analyze how to mitigate those air quality

11 impacts.

12 90. The District stated in the Final SEA that "there are no feasible mitigation measures that
13 would eliminate or reduce the significant adverse operational air quality impacts for NOx emissions to

14 less than significant levels[.]"

15 91. There are mitigation measures, however, available to actually mitigate adverse air
16 quality impacts from the sale of non-compliant NOx furnaces, and the District is required to analyze

17 them and impose them as conditions of the approval of the Project.

18 92. Additionally, although the District has labeled the fee imposed as a "mitigation fee,"
19 the District has expressly stated that the fee does not mitigate the adverse environmental impacts from

20 the sale of non-compliant furnaces in the District. The District has thus failed to justify the need for

21 this "mitigation fee" it and how it mitigates the adverse impacts of 2018 PAR 1111. The "mitigation

22 fee" fails to serve as a mitigation measure that the District is required to identify and consider in

23 response to its finding that the Rule would have a significant adverse air quality impact.
24 93. For the reasons stated above, the District's adoption of 2018 PAR 1111 failed to
25 comply with CEQA. 2018 PAR 1111 will have significant economic, operational, and other impacts

26 on Petitioner/Plaintiff. Petitioner/Plaintiff has no other plain, speedy, or adequate legal remedy for
27 this harm and seek appropriate relief through this Petition and Complaint.

FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act and District Rule 110(e); Inadequate

3 and Incomplete Analysis of Alternatives)

4 94. Petitioner/Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference, as though fully set forth

5 herein, the allegations contained above in Paragraphs 1- 93, inclusive.

6 95. The District is required to develop and analyze a reasonable range of alternatives, and

7 that range "shall include [alternatives] that could feasibly accomplish most of the basic objectives of

8 the project and could avoid or substantially lessen one or more of the significant effects." 14 C.C.R. §

9 15126.6(c).

10 96. District Rule 110(e) also requires an analysis of alternatives and "[a]ny action or

11 proposal for which significant adverse environmental impacts have been identified during the review

12 process shall not be approved or adopted as proposed if there are feasible mitigation measures or

13 feasible alternatives available which would substantially reduce such adverse impact."

14 97. In the Draft SEA, the District failed to develop and analyze a reasonable range of

15 alternatives. The District analyzed 2017 PAR 1111, a "no project" alternative, and three other

16 alternatives. However, the alternatives are all variations on the same concept: revising the NOx

17 emissions limit under the rule and charging various fee amounts for a set amount of time.

18 98. In the Final SEA, the District failed to develop and analyze a reasonable range of

19 alternatives. The District analyzed 2018 PAR 1111, a "no project" alternative, and three other

20 alternatives. However, the alternatives are all variations on the same concept: revising the NOx

21 emissions limit under the rule and charging various fee amounts for a set amount of time.

22 99. The District did not analyze any other alternative ways of regulating NOx emissions

23 from furnaces and mitigating the environmental impacts. For example, the District did not analyze

24 using an actual mitigation fee to fund an offset program.

25 100. The District's decision to curtail its alternatives analysis is particularly problematic as

26 the District admitted that the no feasible mitigation measures are available that would eliminate or

27 reduce the significant adverse operational air quality impacts for NOx emissions if 2018 PAR 1111

28 was implemented.

F 101. For the reasons stated above, the District's adoption of 2018 PAR 1111 failed to

2 comply with CEQA. 2018 PAR 1111 will have significant economic, operational, and other impacts

3 on Petitioner/Plaintiff. Petitioner/Plaintiff has no other plain, speedy, or adequate legal remedy for

4 this harm and seek appropriate relief through this Petition and Complaint.

5 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

6 (Violation of California Environmental Quality Act, Failure to Analyze Cumulative Impacts
7 and Associated Mitigation Measures)

8 102. Petitioner/Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference, as though fully set forth

9 herein, the allegations contained above in Paragraphs 1-101, inclusive.

10 103. The District is required to analyze the cumulative impacts of 2018 PAR 1111. 14 CCR

11 §§ 15065(a)(3); 15064(h)(1). The District purports to rely on previously approved documents to

12 satisfy the discussion of cumulative impacts without identifying which documents upon which the

13 Districts relies.

14 104. Furthermore, the District states that implementation of "other" control measures in its

15 2017 Air Quality Management Plan will reduce exposures to existing NOx emissions, without

16 identifying the relevant control measures.

17 105. The District's cumulative impacts analysis was therefore conclusory and insufficient.

18 106. The District also concluded that "no cumulative mitigation measures for operation are

19 required." As the cumulative impact analysis in the Final SEA was conclusory and insufficient, the

20 associated discussion and analysis of cumulative mitigation measures was also conclusory.

21 107. For the reasons stated above, the District's adoption of 2018 PAR 1111 failed to

22 comply with CEQA. 2018 PAR 1111 will have significant economic, operational, and other impacts

23 on Petitioner/Plaintiff. Petitioner/Plaintiff has no other plain, speedy, or adequate legal remedy for

24 this harm and seek appropriate relief through this Petition and Complaint.

SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act, Health & Safety Code, and California

3 APA for Failure to Disclose Regulatory Provisions to the Public in Advance of Adoption)

4 108. Petitioner/Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference, as though fully set forth
herein, the allegations contained above in Paragraphs 1- 107, inclusive.

6 109. The text of Draft 2018 PAR 1111 was released on January 30, 2018, and there was no
public comment period provided for Draft 2018 PAR 1111. The public comment period for the Draft
SEA, which analyzed a different proposal, closed on February 9, 2018-less than two weeks after

9 Draft 2018 PAR 1111 was released.

10 110. After the public comment period closed for the Draft SEA, the District made further

11 amendments the proposed rule text. The District released 2018 PAR 1111 and the Final SEA only

12 days before the Board's public meeting where 2018 PAR 1111 was adopted.

13 111. The District did not provide a public comment period for 2018 PAR 1111 and the Final

14 SEA.

15 112. The District should have provided additional time for the public to review new 2018

16 PAR 1111 and meaningfully participate in the District's deliberative process relating to these

17 provisions.

18 113. The District's actions violate the California APA, Government Code § 11340 et seq.,

19 by failing to inform the public and provide an opportunity to comment in advance of adopting

20 provisions that will directly impact the regulated comment. California Government Code §

21 11346.8(c) prohibits adopting regulations that have been changed from the version originally made

22 available to the public, unless the change is nonsubstantial or sufficiently related to the original

23 proposal to put the public on notice of the potential change. Here, 2018 PAR 111L varies significantly

24 from 2017 PAR 1111 because the fee structure, amounts, and duration have all changed. 2018 PAR

25 1111 also varies from Draft 2018 PAR 1111 because the duration of the fees has changed for some

26 furnaces and an exemption for propane furnaces has been added. These changes significantly impact

27 the regulated community.

28
18
VERIFIED PETITION FOR FIRST AMENDED WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF:
CASE NO. BS173018

114. The District's actions also violate the Health & Safety Code. Specifically, H&SC

2 section 40725 requires the District to provide at least 30 days' prior notice of any proposed new or

3 amended regulations; that notice must include a copy of the proposed rule, a summary description of

4 the effect of the rule, and an invitation to public comment.

5 115. 2018 PAR 1111 is substantially different than 2017 PAR 1111, and the District did not

6 comply with these notice requirements before adopting 2018 PAR 1111.

7 116. Additionally, the District's actions violate Public Resources Code § 21092 because the

8 District obtained significant new information and revised the proposed rule amendments without

9 providing a new notice to the public. 2018 PAR 1111 is substantially different than 2017 PAR 1111,

10 and the District failed to comply with these notice requirements.

11 117. The District's adoption of 2018 PAR 1111 will have significant economic, operational,

12 and other impacts on Petitioner/Plaintiff. Petitioner/Plaintiff has no other plain, speedy, or adequate
13 legal remedy for this harm and seeks appropriate relief through this Petition and Complaint.

18 119. 2018 PAR 1111 requires OEMs who sell non-compliant furnaces in the District to pay
19 mitigation fee.

20 120. This fee established by 2018 PAR 1111 is a tax, a and not regulatory fee. The primary
21 purpose of the fee is to generate revenue, as evidenced by the fact that the revenue from the fee will be

22 used to, among other possible general uses, fund the rebate program, which the District has

23 "separately" authorized..

24 121. The fee was not passed by two-thirds supermajority, and thus is illegal. California
25 Constitution Article XIII A, Section 3.

26 122. Additionally, the District's adoption of this mitigation fee violates Health & Safety

27 Code section 40727 because the District lacks authority to adopt it.

28 123. The District's adoption of 2018 PAR 1111 will have significant economic, operational,

2 and other impacts on Petitioner/Plaintiff. Petitioner/Plaintiff has no other plain, speedy, or adequate

3 legal remedy for this harm and seeks appropriate relief through this Petition and Complaint.

D Vacate and set aside the NOD for 2018 PAR 1111;

C.

14 adopting any necessary or appropriate amendments to Rule 1111 based on the

d.

16 Comply with the requirements of the Health & Safety Code in these or any

19 2.

20 3. For declaratory relief declaring that the District violated CEQA;

21 For declaratory relief declaring that the issuance of the Final SEA and NOD for 2018

22 PAR 1111 was unlawful, null, void, and unenforceable;

4.

23 For declaratory relief declaring that the District lacks authority to impose the

24 mitigation fee for the purpose of generating revenue for unspecified District programs including,
without limitation the rebate program, and for injunctive relief enjoining the assessment of the
25 mitigation fee;

26 5.

27 6. For costs of suit, including reasonable attorneys' fees; and

Subject: JCI v. South Coast: Amending writ and complaint

Matt,

JCI still intends to file an amended writ and complaint, but it has taken longer to get the filing finalized than anticipated when I emailed last week. We intend to file on Tuesday, June 26. As stated below, we view the amended filing as providing the District 30 days to answer from the time it is filed. We will email the District a copy of the amended filing
the day it is filed.

Thanks,
Kaitlyn

Subject: JCI v. South Coast

Matt,

After reviewing the administrative record, JCI intends to amend its writ and complaint, and I wanted to provide the District notice of this as soon as possible. We intend to file the amended writ/complaint on Friday, June 22. These amendments will be focused on amending the CEQA causes of action, and we will not be adding new, non-CEQA causes of action. To be & clear, we will be retaining Counts Five & Six, which arise under other statutory sections and the CA Constitution, but we will not add new, non-CEQA counts.
We do not see this amendment as impacting the scope of the administrative record as the writ is still challenging the adoption of amendments to Rule 1111. Our first stipulation allows the District to file its responsive pleading 30-days after the record is certified. We view the amended writ/complaint as providing the District a new 30-day period to respond (so 30 days from June 22). If the District would like to amend the stipulation to make clear that the 30-days will run from the amended writ/complaint, we would be happy to do that.

Thanks,
Kaitlyn
