Printed on Recycled Paper SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1.

3 On January 7, 2014, this Court issued a writ of mandate setting aside a mitigated a

4 negative declaration ("MND") for a radio tower project adjacent to a state park and ordered the

5 County of San Bernardino ("County") to prepare an environmental impact report ("EIR"). In

6 affirming this Court's judgment, the Court of Appeal began its opinion by providing the
following guidance:

7

8 In assessing whether a project may have a significant environmental impact under CEQA ..•9 context is everything. In this case, the context is the hilly terrain of

9 undeveloped wilderness property adjacent to a state park, near a national forest, in an area designated in the County
10 land use plans for open space where the public enjoys scenic views and vistas. The proposed project is a 43-foot tall monopole radio antenna, and a 100-square foot equipment building and an

12 adjacent parking space, both surrounded by a six-foot tall security fence and a 10- foot perimeter of cleared vegetation and 30 feet of thinned vegetation. The

13 equipment building (placed on the ridge) and the antenna tower (placed 227 feet

14 below the ridge) would be connected by a cleared six-foot-wide pathway running down the slope. The proposed project would be visible from up to 65 percent of

15 the adjacent state park and from other properties in the vicinity.

16 (Citizens for the Pres. of Rural Living v. Cty. of San Bernardino (2015) No. G050884, 2015

17 WL 4554609 at 1.)

18 2. Forced by this Court and the Court of Appeal to return to the drawing board, the

19 applicant, Lazer Broadcasting, Inc. ("Lazer"), made no changes to the project or its location,

20 despite the courts' focus on the unique characteristics of the project site. In preparing a new,

21

22 legally adequate EIR, an agency "must begin anew the analytical process required under CEQA
and must not attempt to give post hoc rationalizations for actions already taken in violation of

23

24 CEQA, even if done in good faith." (City of Santee v. County of San Diego (1989) 214 Cal.
App. 3d 1438, 1456.)

25 3.

26 Instead of beginning anew and preparing a full EIR, as required by the California
Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), the County prepared a limited, "Focused EIR"

27 addressing only the issues raised by Petitioner Citizens for the Preservation of Rural Living

28 ("CPRL") in the litigation challenging the MND adopted for the Project. The County

- SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

r erroneously contends that all issues other than those addressed in the EIR were either addressed

2 in the previously prepared MND, which was invalidated by this Court, or not raised by CPRL
3 and thus waived in the writ of mandate proceedings.
A 4. Despite strong community opposition to the Project, including from the Yucaipa
5 Valley Conservancy, the Wildlands Conservancy, the City of Yucaipa, and Native American

6 Tribes, the County approved the Project and certified the EIR on May 1, 2018.
7 5. Petitioner CPRL files this Supplemental Petition for Writ of Mandate seeking a

8 writ of mandate compelling the County to fully comply with CEQA, Health and Safety Code
9 sections 21000, et seq., and the Writ of Mandate issued by this Court on January 7, 2014. This
10 Court retained jurisdiction over this action "until . the Court has determined that Respondent
11 has complied with the provisions of CEQA." The County's EIR fails to comply with CEQA.
12

13 JURISDICTION

14 6. This Court has jurisdiction over the writ action under sections 1085 and 1094.5 of
15 the Code of Civil Procedure and sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.

16 The Project site is located entirely in San Bernardino County.
17

18 PARTIES

19 7. Petitioner Citizens for the Preservation of Rural Living is a public interest
20 association that seeks to ensure that the open space and natural wilderness values of the Pisgah
21 Peak and Wildwood Canyon State Park areas are preserved.
22 8. Respondent County of San Bernardino is a political subdivision of the state of
23 California and the lead agency for the approval of the Project.
24 9. Real Party in Interest Lazer Broadcasting, Inc. is the Project applicant as
25 identified on the notice of determination filed for the Project approval.
26 10. Real Parties in Interest named as Does I to 10 are given fictitious names because
27 their names and capacities are presently unknown to Petitioner.

2 SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

STATEMENT OF FACTS

2 The Project and Project Site

3 1. In both the original project analyzed in the MND set aside by this Court as well as

4 the Project analyzed in the Focused EIR, Lazer's application was for the construction of an

5 unmanned, 43-foot tall monopole and radio broadcast facility on a 38.12-acre site in

6 unincorporated San Bernardino County. The Project would also include a 100-square foot

7 equipment shelter, a parking space, and a six-foot-tall spiked wrought iron security fence

8 around both the pole and the equipment shelter. The monopole tower would hold four

9 antennae, each of which would extend 4.5 feet from the monopole, beginning 21.5 feet above

10 the ground and ending 42 feet above the ground. Each copper antenna would house four bent

11 poles. The tower would be connected to the equipment shelter by a six-foot-wide path

12 approximately 680 feet in length that would be cleared of all vegetation.
13 2. The unpaved Pisgah Peak Road provides the sole roadway access to the Project

14 site.

15 3. Construction and installation of the tower base, equipment shelter, 6,700 feet of

16 underground electrical wires, and a 650-foot trench to enable power delivery to the site will

17 disturb undeveloped wilderness and vegetation on and around the Project site.

18 4. The City of Yucaipa sits to the west and to the south. Wildwood Canyon State

19 Park and the San Bernardino National Forest border the Project site to the west. Also nearby
20 are Bureau of Land Management-designated wilderness areas and the 2,169-acre Oak Glen

21 Preserve, operated by the Wildlands Conservancy. Over 350,000 people visit wildlands in the

22 area each year.

23 5. Wildwood Canyon State Park ("Park") was formally dedicated in 2003. The State

24 Park was formed to preserve the wilderness aspects of the area and has approximately 350,000

25 visitors each year. The primary viewshed for hikers and equestrian users within the State Park

26 is northeast toward Pisgah Peak and the Project site, as most of the State Park's trails trend in

27 this direction. Three multi-use recreational trails are located within several hundred feet of the

28 Project's boundary, and the end point of one of these trails is the Project's boundary. The Park

3 SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

is home to wild animals, ancient oaks, wide open vistas, and a network of hiking and biking
2 trails. While the Park currently consists of 900 acres, the County of San Bernardino's Oak Glen
3 Community Plan calls for efforts to expand the park where possible.
4 6. As the site sits on a steep, west-facing slope, the Project would be visible from
two-thirds of Wildwood Canyon State Park.

6 7. Several policies of the County General Plan and the Oak Glen Community Plan
7 require preservation and protection of scenic vistas and habitat values on and near the Project

8 site.

8. The County General Plan designates the Project site as "OG/RL-20," a
10 designation that only allows uses associated with rural living and 20-acre minimum lot sizes.
11 As the transmission tower is not a by-right use for the site, a conditional use permit was
12 required to construct the Project.

13

14 Prior Review and Approval of the Project

15 9. In 2007, Lazcr submitted an application to the County to erect a 140-foot tall

16 radio transmission tower on a site along Pisgah Peak Road, adjacent to Wildwood Canyon State

17 Park. The applicant proposed a lattice-style tower and associated outbuildings, which would

18 have been located 60 feet lower in elevation than the current proposed tower location. In

19 response to concerns from County staff and the Planning Commission, the Project tower was

20 reduced to 80 feet in height.

21 10. Although accepted by the Planning Commission, the County Board of

22 Supervisors ("Board") rejected the 80 foot version of the Project, with prejudice, on March 3,

23 2009. At that hearing, the Board found the radio transmission tower to be an inappropriate land

24 use for the site, and that the tower was incompatible with existing and future land uses in the

25 vicinity.

26 11. Specifically, the Board found that the tower "would negatively impact on the

27 preservation of the natural conditions of the open space corridor and the maintenance of the

28 scenic vistas from Wildwood Canyon State Park." The Board also found that the Project site

4 SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

had inadequate access due to the steep, narrow, and unpaved condition of Pisgah Peak Road.

2 The Board determined that the Project would conflict with the goals of the County General Plan
that preserve open space corridors, scenic vistas, native wildlife, and Pisgah Peak itself.

4 12. On May 6, 2010, the applicant refiled its application with the County, seeking to
erect a 43-foot tall monopole at a location 60 feet higher in elevation, thus making the

6 monopole as visible as the 80 foot tower.

7 13. In or around August 2010, prior to obtaining permit, the applicant installed a 40-

8 foot test pole on the Project site. On April 14, 2017, County Counsel filed a Preliminary Return

9 to Writ of Mandate indicating the mock-up pole had been removed.

10 14. The Planning Commission held hearings on the Project on March 17, 2011 and on

11 May 5, 2011. Prior to these meetings, concerned citizens and organizations submitted 3,000

12 letters opposing the Project.

13 15. Staff recommended denial of the Project, due to aesthetic and fire safety impacts

14 that were not mitigated by the Project redesign. The staff report opined, "while the size of the

15 tower has been reduced by almost 50%, the impact on the views from the State Park and other

16 properties in the area will be similar to the previous proposal. The BOS decided this was a

17 significant negative impact. There are no new mitigation measures presented that would

18 effectively reduce the impacts on the environment with respect to aesthetics as previously

19 determined, and therefore, staff is unable to support the proposed Conditional Use Permit."

20 16. At the May 5, 2011 hearing, the Planning Commission adopted an intent to

21 approve the Project and directed staff to prepare the required environmental analysis and

22 findings for approval.

23 17. The Initial Study/Draft Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Project was

24 released on October 28, 2011 and circulated until December 9, 2011.

25 18. An estimated 17,000 letters and signatures opposing the Project were submitted to
26 the County prior to the September 20, 2012 Planning Commission hearing.

27 19. Petitioner, the Wildlands Conservancy, the Yucaipa Valley Conservancy, Friends

28 of Wildwood Canyon State Park, the City of Yucaipa, and others submitted extensive

5 SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

comments to the County objecting to the Project. These comments expressed concerns with the

2 Project site's location adjacent to Wildwood State Park and the national forest, contained
3 extensive lay testimony as to the Project's impacts on scenic vistas in the Park, and noted the

4 Project's potential impacts on native and migrating birds, as well as the failure of the MND to
5 adequately disclose and analyze impacts.

6 20. Petitioner engaged engineers to identify existing communications towers within
7 the applicant's desired 73-square mile "area to locate" that would enable Lazer to expand its
8 audience and meet FCC requirements. De La Hunt Communications Services identified two
9 existing communications towers in Cherry Valley and Beaumont that would expand the
10 applicant's signal coverage to approximately 1.3 million and 1.7 million people, respectively,
11 an audience increase of up to 900 percent.
12 21. The applicant's own studies identified additional alternative sites, including one
13 site at the entrance to the San Jacinto Mountains that would expand Lazer Broadcasting's reach
14 from 190,495 listeners to 652,218 listeners.

15 22. The Planning Commission held a hearing on the Project on September 20, 2012,
16 at which it voted to approve the MND, a variance for the fire overlay, and the conditional use
17 permit required for the Project. Petitioner's appeal to the Board of Supervisors was denied.
18

19 Trial Court Proceedings on Petition Challenging MND

20 23. Petitioner filed its Petition for Writ of Mandate on December 21, 2012.

21 24. On February 4, 2013, Petitioners filed an Ex Parte Application for a Stay of

22 Permits and Alternative Application for a Temporary Restraining Order and an Order

23 Shortening Time for a Motion for Preliminary Injunction.

24 25. On February 22, 2013, this Court granted Petitioner's Motion for Stay subject to

25 the posting of a bond. On March 28, 2013, Petitioner posted the required undertaking.

26 26. Following briefing, on October 1, 2013, this Court issued its ruling granting

27 Petitioner's writ petition. On December 17, 2013, this Court entered judgment in favor of

28 Petitioner. On January 7, 2014, this Court issued a writ of mandate vacating approval of the

6 SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

MND, conditional use permit and major variance.

2
Appeal

4 27. On February 7, 2014, Real Party in Interest Lazer filed a Notice of Appeal.

5 28. Following briefing and oral argument, on July 28, 2015, the Fourth District Court

6 of Appeal affirmed this Court's judgment in Citizens for the Preservation of Rural Living V.

7 County of San Bernardino (2015) No. G050884, 2015 WL 4554609, concluding "the trial court

8 correctly granted the writ of mandate compelling the County to prepare an EIR before

9 approving the Project." (Id. at 14.)

10 29. The Court of Appeal added:

11 In assessing the potential significance of an impact, setting is critical. The Guidelines state, 'An ironclad definition of significant effect is not always possible
12 because the significance of an activity may vary with the setting. For example, an

13 activity which may not be significant in an urban area may be significant in a rural area.' (Guidelines, § 15064, subd. (b); see Olmsted Citizens for a Better
14 Community V. U.S. (8th Cir. 1986) 793 F.2d 201, 206 [distinguishing aesthetic

15 impacts in 'a pristine wilderness area' from those in 'an urban city block'].) It is undisputed the project site is undeveloped pristine ridgeline wilderness adjacent to
16 a state wilderness park.

17
(Id. at 11.)
18

19 Subsequent Environmental Review
30. On October 24, 2014, the County published a Notice of Preparation ("NOP") of a
20

21 Draft EIR. The NOP provides:

22 Based on the Court ruling, the lead agency has determined that the Project must be further analyzed for potentially significant environmental impacts. As such,
23 preparation of a Focused EIR is appropriate. Because the Project was previously analyzed in an MND, and since only specific issues were addressed in the writ of
24 mandate and ultimately ruled on by the Court, the lead agency has determined the

25 following environmental considerations as potentially significant effects of the project to be further evaluated in a Focused EIR:
26

27 Aesthetics
Land Use
28 Hazards (Fire Safety)

7 SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

F Recreation

2 (NOP, p. 7, emphasis added.)
3 31. The NOP also indicates that the EIR would consider one alternative site within
4 the area that meets FCC line-of-sight and minimal signal strength requirements. The NOP
5 states, "In the event it is determined that the proposed Alternative Site is not suitable for
6 evaluation in the EIR, the County may select another Alternative Site (Ibid.)
7 32. In May 2016, the County released a Draft EIR for a the Project. The Project
8 evaluated in the Draft EIR has no material changes from the Project considered in the MND.
9 33. In the "Summary of Environmental Analyses" section of the Draft EIR, the
10 County states:
11 Impacts Previously Reviewed Under Mitigated Negative Declaration
12
Certain environmental factors required to be considered under CEQA were 13 previously reviewed in the October 26, 2011 Mitigated Negative Declaration
14 (MND) approved by the County of San Bernardino Board of Supervisors on

15 November 27, 2012. Since the adequacy of the analysis for these environmental [factors] (sic) were not challenged as part of the December 21, 2012 petition for
16 writ of mandate filed by CPRL, they are not being further evaluated within this EIR. These environmental factors include: Agricultural and Forestry Resources, 17 Air Quality, Cultural Resources, Geology and Soils, Greenhouse Gases,
18 Hydrology and Water Quality, Mineral Resources, Noise, Population/Housing, Public Services, Transportation/Traffic, and Utilities and Service Systems. Since 19 no substantial changes have occurred to the Proposed Project as previously
20 reviewed, mitigation measures contained with the October 26, 2011 MND are still applicable and will be incorporated as part of the Project's Conditions of Approval
21 should it be approved.
22 (Draft EIR, p. 1-7.)
23
34. 24 In April 2017, the County published the Final EIR. The Final EIR provides:

25 Many of the comments submitted were general and asked questions already addressed in the Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration dated October 26,
26 2011. For example, potential impacts to air quality and soil erosion due to the construction of the Lazer Broadcasting radio broadcast facility were previously 27 assessed in the County's Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration and
28 determined to have a less than significant impact. In October 2013, the Superior

8 SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Court required the County to further evaluate and prepare a focused EIR on the

2 potentially significant issues limited to: Aesthetics, Land Use, Hazards (Fire Safety), and Recreation. All other issues were either determined to be have been adequately addressed in the Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration or were

4 not addressed and thus waived in the writ of mandate proceedings.

5 (Final EIR, pp. 2-2. 2-3, emphasis added.)

6 35. Petitioner submitted numerous comment letters raising the concerns identified in
7 the instant petition. Petitioner also submitted additional studies and descriptions of alternatives
8 prepared by Bert Goldman, an engineer with specialized experience in FCC rules and
9 regulations, as well as a geotechnical analysis of erosion and potential excavation and
10 compaction prepared by Helfrich-Associates.
11 36. Another 3,000 signatures opposing the project were submitted related to the
12 processing of the EIR.
13 37. On November 9, 2017, the San Bernardino County Planning Commission
14 approved the proposed Conditional Use Permit and recommended certification of the EIR.
15 38. On April 17, 2018, the San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors considered
16 the appeal filed by Petitioner. On May 1, 2018, by a 3-2 vote, the Board of Supervisors
17 certified the Final EIR, adopted the Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding
18 Considerations, adopted the Findings for Project approval as adopted by the Planning
19 Commission, approved the Conditional Use Permit subject to the Conditions of Approval, and
20 directed the Clerk of the Board to file a Notice of Determination.
21 39. A Notice of Determination of the County's action was posted on May 2, 2018.
22 40. This Supplemental Petition for Writ of Mandate was timely filed.
23

24 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES
25 AND INADEQUATE REMEDIES AT LAW

26 41. Petitioner objected to the Project in the County's administrative review process
27 for the EIR and fully exhausted its administrative remedies.
28 42. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

CF
9 SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

unless this Court grants the requested writs of mandate.

2 43. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.7 by filing a
3 copy of this petition with the California Attorney General. A copy of that notice is attached as
4 Exhibit A.

5 44. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by providing
6 the County with notice of intention to commence the action. A copy of that notice is attached
7 as Exhibit B.

8 45. Petitioner elects to prepare the administrative record. A copy of that election is

13 (Against Respondent and Real Parties in Interest)

14 46. Paragraphs 1 through 45 are fully incorporated herein.

15 47. The County has a mandatory and ministerial duty to comply with the terms of this
16 Court's Judgment.

17 48. The December 17, 2013 Judgment provides that a writ of mandate " "The County

18 is required to prepare a legally adequate EIR in compliance with CEQA prior to any further

19 approvals of the proposed Project." The Judgment further states that Lazer and its agents are

20 enjoined from any activities altering the status quo of the Project site "[u]ntil a legally adequate

21 EIR is prepared."

22 49. The County contends that it was permitted to prepare a limited, "focused EIR"
23 because the MND prepared for the Project previously reviewed twelve environmental areas that

24 may potentially be impacted by the Project.

25 50. However, this Court's January 7, 2014 Peremptory Writ of Mandate ordered the
26 County to "set aside and rescind the adoption of the mitigated negative declaration." The
27 County's suggestion that this Court issued a limited writ is belied by the plain language of this
28 Court's writ.

10 SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

51. Furthermore, Public Resources Code section 21168.9 provides that when a public

2 agency's decision, determination, or finding does not comply with CEQA, a peremptory writ of

3 mandate must issue containing one or more of the following mandates:

4 (1) A mandate that the determination, finding, or decision be voided by the public

5 agency, in whole or in part.

6 (3) A mandate that the public agency take specific action as may be necessary to

7 bring the determination, finding, or decision into compliance with [CEQA].

8 (Pub. Resources Code, § 21168.9, subd. (a), emphasis added.)

9 52. Under Public Resources Code Section 21168.9, subd. (b), a court must make three

10 specific findings prior to issuing a "limited writ" of the type the County contends the trial court

11 issued: "(1) [T]he portion or specific project activity or activities are severable, (2) severance

12 will not prejudice complete and full compliance with [CEQA], and (3) the court has not found

13 the remainder of the project to be in noncompliance with [CEQA]."

14 53. Without valid severability findings, a CEQA writ may not be limited to a "portion

15 of a determination, finding, decision or the specific project activity or activities found to be in

16 noncompliance" with CEQA. (Ibid.) The trial court did not make any such severability

17 findings. Rather, the trial court ordered the MND be voided in whole, and that an EIR be

18 prepared. The trial court did not authorize a limited-scope EIR.

19 54. By preparing a "Focused EIR" in reliance upon the MND that was vacated by this
20 Court, and excluding the analysis of numerous areas in which the Project may have potentially

21 significant environmental effects, the County failed to prepare a legally adequate EIR in

22 compliance with CEQA. Thus, the County's certification of the Final EIR violates this Court's

23 judgment.

24 55. Petitioner is entitled to a writ of mandate requiring the County to set aside the EIR

25 and project approvals unless and until the County complies with the Judgment of this Court.

5 56.

6 57. Paragraphs 1 through 55 are fully incorporated herein.

7 The purpose of an environmental impact report is to provide public agencies and

8 the public in general with detailed information about the effect which a proposed project is

9 likely to have on the environment; to list ways in which the significant effects of such a

10 project might be minimized; and to indicate alternatives to such a project. (Pub. Res. Code §
21061.)

11 58.
12

13 By failing to analyze all effects which the Project is likely to have on the
environment, the County's certification of the Final EIR violates CEQA.

14 59.

15 Among other areas not studied, the County's decision to not prepare a full EIR

16 resulted in the County not analyzing the Project's impacts on tribal cultural resources. A

17 Cultural Study submitted to the County and an opposition letter from the San Manuel Band of

18 Mission Indians demonstrate that tribal cultural resources constitutes relevant new information,

19 and this information was improperly omitted from the EIR. Additionally, five other tribes

20 opposed or raised concerns about the project because of its impact on the Wildwood Canyon

21 area, which is a culturally significant and sensitive area for tribes and tribal citizens in the

22 region. These tribes include the Morongo Band of Mission Indians, Cahuilla Band of Indians,

23 the Sycuan Band of the Kumeyaay Nation, Rincon Band of Luiseño Indians, and the Picayune
Rancheria of the Chukchansi Indians.

24 60.

25

26 The EIR fails to adequately analyze the Project's visual impacts and the Project's

27 impacts on recreational uses of the Park. After first stating that the visual impacts of the Project
are "less than significant" after mitigation (DEIR, p. 1-15), the EIR concludes that the visual

28 impacts are "significant and unavoidable" (DEIR, p. 4.1-25). The DEIR fails to reconcile this
disparity, and when this disparity was brought to the County's attention in comments on the

12 SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

H

2 Draft EIR, the Final EIR failed entirely to respond to CPRL's concern.

61.
3 The EIR's alternatives analysis is legally inadequate. The EIR fails to consider

4 feasible alternatives. Petitioner submitted an expert analysis identifying six alternative site

5 locations that satisfy the Project's reasonable objectives.

6 62.

7 The EIR rejects feasible alternatives on the basis of improperly restrictive project

8 objectives. This EIR considers a limited range of alternatives, analyzing only two potentially

9 feasible alternatives - a "No Project/Single-Family Residence Development" and one "Other

10 Location Alternative." The EIR rejects the "Other Location Alternative" on the basis that it

11 does not meet the Project's objectives of contributing to the expansion of the Park and creating

12 long-term buffering of land uses near the Park. However, the EIR fails to explain how

13 developing this Project within pristine wilderness adjacent to a State Park helps the Park expand
and/or protects the Park.

14 63.

15 The EIR's land use and general plan consistency analysis is insufficient. The

16 Draft EIR acknowledges, "The Proposed Project is in direct conflict with the goal and policies

17 of the County of San Bernardino General Plan and the Oak Glen Community Plan." Yet, the

18 County claims that the impact is "less than significant" after deed restricting the unused portion

19 of the 38.12-acre Project Site "for passive use by visitors to the Wildwood Canyon State Park."
(DEIR, p. 1-20.) The County failed to provide any substantive analysis as to why deed
20 restricting the unused portion of the project site reduces the project's inconsistency with the
21

22 Plan policies to a "less than significant" level.

64.
23 The Final EIR's responses to comments are inadequate. The County fails to

24 reconcile the trial court's conclusion that a fair argument exists of an inconsistency with

25 General Plan Goal LU2 and Oak Glen Community Plan goals, even with the open space

26 easement to the Park. Rather than locating the Project in an alternative location that would not

27 result in this inconsistency, the County instead repeatedly argues that the installation of the

28 radio tower "allows for passive use of the property; without the Project, the public use of this

13 SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

F undeveloped land would not be possible." (FEIR, p. 3-14.)

2 65. The EIR's erosion impacts are inadequately analyzed. The EIR fails to analyze
3 the impact of the approximate one-mile extension of utilities along Pisgah Peak Road. 4 Petitioner presented a geotechnical study by an engineering expert showing that the proposed 5 method of construction, using hand tools only, is a not a feasible method of construction. The
6 geotechnical study also showed that significant erosion already exists along Pisgah Peak Road, 7 and the digging of the trench would further exacerbate that erosion. In addition, the study 8 concludes that it will not be possible to properly compact the trench with hand equipment after 9 it is refilled.
10

11 66. The EIR fails to adequately consider the Project's growth inducing / cumulative

12 impacts. The Draft EIR states that "no more than seven (7) towers would be constructed in the

13 vicinity and all would be subject to potentially limiting access issues due to Pisgah Peak Road

14 being private and due to power source availability. Therefore, cumulative impacts to aesthetic

15 resources would not be considered significant." (DEIR, p. 5-7.) The EIR's claim that much of

16 the area surrounding the Proposed Project could not be developed with additional broadcast

17 towers due to the steep terrain and limited access from Pisgah Peak Road is belied by the

18 project applicant's current attempt to develop a broadcast facility in an area of steep terrain with

19 limited access to Pisgah Peak Road.

20 67. The EIR fails to adequately consider fire safety impacts. The Project site is
21 located within County Fire 1 Safety Area 1 ("FS 1 Area"). The FS 1 Area is "characterized by
22 areas with moderate and steep terrain and moderate to heavy fuel loading contributing to high
23 fire hazard conditions." (Development Code § 82.13.030.) The Project will enhance the risk of
24 wildfire already associated with the high fire hazard conditions in the area. The tower and tower
25 antenna will contribute to this a increased risk by adding a new source of electricity and new
26 structures which could attract lightening during storms. The analysis in the EIR focuses solely
27 on an unmanned structure and the impacts to the radio tower equipment. The General Plan
28 policies and goals, including policy S 3.2, directs that the County "will endeavor to prevent

14 SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- wildfires and continue to provide public safety from wildfire hazards." The EIR fails to provide

2 a detailed analysis of the probability of a lightning strike of a 43-foot monopole located on a

3 ridge line.

4 68. The Project findings are not supported by substantial evidence. An agency's
5 findings when making a land use decision must be supported by substantial evidence.
6 (Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles (1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 515-
7 18.) For example, the County's finding that the Project is consistent with the goals, maps,
8 policies, and standards of the County's General Plan and the Oak Glen Community Plan is
9 unsupported by any evidence in the record.
10 69. Specifically, the Project is inconsistent with Oak Glen Community Plan OG/OS
11 1.2, which requires the County to "support and actively pursue the expansion of Wildwood
12 Canyon State Park, including cooperation with open space community groups such as the
13 Wildlands Conservancy and the Yucaipa Valley Conservancy which already own land
14 dedicated for open space adjacent to Wildwood Canyon State Park and have expressed interest
15 in purchasing additional properties for open space purposes." The placement of the Project
16 adjacent to already conserved lands outside the Park, as well as to the Park, may endanger
17 expansion of the Park. The Project is also inconsistent with provisions of the General Plan that
18 protect views and scenic vistas.
19

20 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

21 For Violation of San Bernardino County Development Code San Bernardino County Code 82.11.030
22 (Against Respondent and Real Parties in Interest)

23
70. 24 Paragraphs 1 through 69 are fully incorporated herein.
71. 25 Pursuant to Development Code Section 82.11.030 (Biotic Resources Overlay), a

26 "land-use application shall include a biotic resources report." This section further provides that

27 "the biotic resources report shall identify all biotic resources located on the site and those on
adjacent parcels that could be impacted by the proposed development .. (Ibid., emphasis 28

15 SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

r added.)

2 72. The biologic study prepared for the Project fails to study adjacent parcels,
3 including Pisgah Peak Road, which is clearly defined in the project description as a part of the
4 Project. The County has failed to comply with the County Development Code by not preparing
5 a a biological assessment of adjacent parcels as required by the Development Code.
6

7 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

8 In each of the respects enumerated above, the County has violated its duties under law,
9 abused its discretion, and failed to proceed in the manner required by law.
10 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for relief as follows:
11 1. For a stay of any permits issued in furtherance of this Project until this action can be
12 decided on the merits.

13 2. For an alternative and peremptory writ of mandate, commanding the County:
14 a. To set aside and vacate its certification of the Final EIR and adopted Findings and
15 Statement of Overriding Considerations for the Project;
16 b. To set aside and vacate any approvals for the Project based upon the Final EIR
17 and Findings, including the conditional use permit.
18 C. To prepare and certify a legally adequate EIR for the Project so that the County
19 will have a complete disclosure document before it, identify for the decision-
20 makers and public the potential significant impacts of the Project, and enable it to
21 formulate realistic and feasible alternatives and mitigation measures to avoid
22 those impacts;
23 3. For an order enjoining the County and Real Parties in Interest from taking any action
24 to construct any portion of the Project or to develop or alter the Project site in any way that
25 could result in a significant adverse impact on the environment unless and until a lawful
26 approval is obtained from the County after the preparation and consideration of an adequate
27 EIR;

28 4. For costs of the suit;

16 SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

5. For reasonable attorneys' fees; and

2 6. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
