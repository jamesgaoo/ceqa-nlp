25 9. Petitioners are informed and believe venue properly vests in this Court under three
26 bases. First, all or a substantial portion of the events underlying this Petition occurred in the
27 County, thus, rendering this Court the proper venue under Code of Civil Procedure section 393.
28 Second, Petitioners seek relief against the County, which gives this Court an additional
BUCHALTER

BN 31989089v7

entitlement to venue under Code of Civil Procedure section 394. Lastly, Petitioners are informed
2 and believe that this Court has venue over this Petition under Code of Civil Procedure 395
3 because all the Respondents reside in the County.
4 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

5 A. THE COUNTY'S URGENCY ORDINANCE
6 10. Over two decades ago, California started systemically relaxing its onerous
7 limitations on cannabis cultivation and usage throughout the state. On November 5, 1996,
8 California voters passed Proposition 215, commonly referred to as the Compassionate Use Act,
9| which decriminalized the possession and use of cannabis for medical purposes ("CUA").
10 Codified in Health & Safety Code section 11362.5, the CUA authorized caregivers to prescribe,
11 and for seriously ill patients to use, cannabis. Seven years after the CUA's passage, the
12| California Legislature enacted the Medical Marijuana Program Act, expanding the CUA's
13 protections and conferring seriously ill patients and caregivers the right to cultivate medical
14 cannabis.

15 11. In September 2015, the California Legislature enacted the Medical Cannabis
16 Regulation and Safety Act ("MCRSA"), which decriminalized the commercial cultivation,
17 manufacture, retail sale, transport, distribution, delivery, and testing of medical cannabis. The
18 MCRSA created a comprehensive state licensing system for commercial cannabis usage and
19 directed local governments to implement regulations governing the approval of cannabis licenses.
20 Two years later, California voters approved another ballot measure concerning cannabis,
21 Proposition 64, which is known as the California Marijuana Legalization Act (the "CMLA"), and
22 which is codified in Health & Safety Code section 11362.2(b)(2). The CMLA legalized the
23 personal usc and cultivation of carinabis in California. California's liberalization of the cannabis
24 industry created enormous investment opportunities for commercial cannabis cultivation
25 throughout the state.
26 12. Unregulated innabis cultivation persisted throughout the County for decades
27 before California enacted the CMLA. County Code § 17.95.120(G). The County's optimal
28 climate and abundance of inexpensive real property resulting from the catastrophic Butte Fire
BUCHALTER
A PROFESSIOAM COAPORATION 3
ANGKLES FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT
BN 31989089v7

made the County an attractive site for cannabis cultivation. See County Code § 17.95.120(S). On
2| May 10, 2016, the Board responded to the County's perceived rise in cannabis cultivation by
3 adopting an urgency ordinance - the Urgency Ordinance Regulating Medical Cannabis
Cultivation and Commercial Uses Involving Medical Cannabis (the "Urgency Ordinance"). The
Urgency Ordinance established restrictive land use regulations governing the cultivation,
manufacture, testing, distribution, transportation, which constrained the County's cannabis
7 industry's expansion efforts. The County intended to maintain the Urgency Ordinance until it
8 could complete its environmental review and replace the Urgency Ordinance with permanent
regulations on commercial cannabis cultivation. (See May 10, 2016, Board of Supervisors
10 "Medical Cannabis Cultivation and Commerce Urgency Ordinance").
11 13. Under the Urgency Ordinance, the County required all commercial cannabis
12 cultivators to register any proposed medical cannabis cultivation site with the County's Planning
13| Department by June 30, 2016. County Code § 17.95.165(A). The Urgency Ordinance also
14 imposed t deadline of May 10, 2016 for all applicants to have satisfied the conditions enumerated
15| in County Code section 17.95.165. County Code § 17.95.165(A)(1)-(2). Specifically, the County
16 imposed such conditions to ensure each applicant had made demonstrable progress towards the
17 development of commercial medical cannabis cultivation site before the registration deadline. Id.
18 The Urgency Ordinance directed the Planning Department to issue a one year "certificate of

19 registration" to all applicants who fulfilled the County's cannabis cultivation site registration
20 requirements and paid the applicable registration fee. County Code 17.95.165(C).
21 B. PETITIONERS' REGISTRATION OF COMMERCIAL CANNABIS
22 CULTIVATION FACILITIES IN THE COUNTY

23 14. Petitioner Anna Lewis ("Lewis") timely submitted to the County's Planning

24 Department a complete commercial mixed light cannabis registration application covering a

25 canopy size of 22,000 square feet. Along with her application, Lewis paid the County's

26 applicable registration fee. On August 7, 2017, the County's Planning Department issued a

27 Certificate of Cannabis Cultivation Registration, concluding Lewis had satisfied the County's

28 cannabis cultivation registration requirements.

15. Petitioner Sheryl Straub ("Straub") timely submitted to the County's Planning
Department a complete commercial mixed light cannabis registration application similarly
covering a canopy of 22,000 square feet. Along with her application, Straub paid the County's
applicable registration fee. On September 22, 2017, the County's Planning Department issued a
Certificate of Cannabis Cultivation Registration, concluding Straub had satisfied the County's
cannabis cultivation registration requirements.

C. THE COUNTY'S DEFICIENT DRAFT AND FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL
8 IMPACT REPORTS ON THE RECENTLY ENACTED ORDINANCE
BANNING COMMERCIAL CANNABIS CULTIVATION

10 a. The County's Draft Environmental Impact on the Proposed Ordinance Establishing Permanent Land Use Regulations Governing Commercial
11 Cannabis Cultivation within the County
16.
12 In early 2016, the Board directed the County staff to prepare an ordinance

13 establishing permanent land use regulations for the cultivation, manufacture, testing, distribution,

14 and storage of medical and recreational cannabis cultivation within the County. The Board's

15 directive ensured the County could regulate commercial cannabis cultivation, while raising funds

16 through registration fees to enforce the ordinance. After Drafting the Medical Cannabis

17 Cultivation and Commerce Ordinance (the "Regulatory Ordinance"), the County's Planning

18 Department made two critical findings. First, it concluded that the Draft Regulatory Ordinance

19 constituted project under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") as an activity

20 that may cause either a direct or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical environmental change.

21 Pub. Res. Code § 21080(a); 14 Cal. Reg. Code § 15378(a). Second, it determined that the

22 Regulatory Ordinance may have a significant effect on the environment, thus, requiring it, as the

23 lead agency, to prepare an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"). 14 Cal. Reg. Code

24 §§ 15060(d), 15063(a); see Gilroy Citizens for Responsible Planning v. City of Gilroy, 140 Cal

25 App. 4th 911, 927 (2006) (noting that a lead agency need not conduct an initial study when it

26 decided to prepare an EIR).
17.
27 On April 7, 2016, the County issued a Notice of Preparation ("NOP") informing

28 the general public and the required agencies entitled to notice under CEQA. The County's NOP

BUCHALTER
PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION 5
ANCEIES FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT
BN 31989089v7

indicated it planned to prepare a Draft EIR expounding three issues: (1) the project; (2) the
2 project's probable environmental impact; and (3) the feasible mitigation measures and feasible
3 alternatives to lessen the project's environmental impact. 14 Cal. Reg. Code § 15082(a). The
4 County's NOP also acknowledges that "there are numerous growers currently operating in the
5| County and that there would be a benefit to permitting and regulating this industry. . .." Based on
6 this acknowledgment, the County's NOP confirmed the County's plan "to permit and regulate
other commercial cannabis activities associated with medical cannabis, including distributing,
8 manufacturing, and transporting."
9 18. On November 8, 2016, Calaveras County voters approved a second ordinance,
10 Measure C, requiring all persons engaged in commercial cannabis activity to pay a special
11 Commercial Cannabis Activity Tax ("Measure C Tax"). County Code § 3.56.040. The County
12 earmarked taxes collected from the Measure C Tax for its general use fund to use for general
13 governmental purposes. County Code § 3.56.030(C).
14 19. In January 2017, the newly-elected Board drastically shifted its stance towards
15| commercial cannabis cultivation, instead opting to completely ban commercial cannabis
16 cultivation and place onerous restrictions on personal and caregiver growers.
17 20. On May 1, 2017, the County posted its Draft EIR on its website, provided it to the
18 County clerk, and issued a press release to the general public as directed under CEQA. Pub. Res.
19 Code § 21092(b)(3)(A); 14 Cal. Reg. Code § 15087(a). The County's notices informed the
20 general public that its Draft EIR was open for public review and comment until June 14, 2017.
21 21. The County's Draft EIR identified the Regulatory Ordinance as the "proposed
22 project and purported to analyze eight categories of environmental impacts. At the Board's
23| behest, the County's Planning Department also injected into the Draft EIR the Ban Ordinance,
24| which it mislcadingly classified as a feasible alternative to the regulatory ordinance. The Draft
25 EIR devotes 184 pages towards explicating the proposed project's significant environmental
26 impacts and feasible alternatives. Although the County acknowledged the Ban Ordinance
27 constituted a separate project, the Draft EIR briefly discusses the Ban Ordinance in the sections
28 entitled "Environmental Setting, Impacts and Mitigation Measures" and "Alternative 2" to the
BUCHALTER
A PROIESSUXAL COXPORATIOA 6
LoS AXGH.ES FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT
BN 31989089v7

"proposed project."

22. Besides superficially analyzing the Ban Ordinance, the Draft EIR suffered from
3 multiple other defects, which include: (1) using the wrong "baseline" facts about existing
conditions, distorting its study of future effects; (2) treating all cannabis farms as new to
5 exaggerate the impacts of the Regulatory Ordinance; and (3) omitting crucial information and
6 explanations to support the County's Planning Department claims.

23. The Ban Ordinance prohibited new commercial cannabis cultivation, processing,
8 and distribution within the County, Relatedly, the Ban Ordinance required all authorized
commercial cannabis cultivators under the Urgency Ordinance to cease operations and restore
10 their existing cultivation sites to a suitable alternative use. Section 17.95.050 of the Ban

to 11 Ordinance also obligated individual property owners remove any temporary cannabis
12 cultivation structures and undertake immediate remediation measures. Specifically, individual
13 property owners were required to prevent: (1) erosion and run-off; (2) visual blight; (3) illegal
14 diversion of water supply; (4) contamination of soil; (5) contamination of waters of the State from
15 soil additives; (5) improper keeping, storage, and disposal of rodenticides, fungicides, herbicides,
16 and pesticides; and (6) improper keeping, generation, storage, or disposal of hazardous materials
17 which may harm the public health or the environment. County Code § 17.95.050 (B). The Ban
18 imposed nine additional remediation measures on current owners of former cannabis cultivation
19 sites to restore the sites to suitable subsequent use within 24 months after the Ban became
20 effective. County Code § 17.95.050(C).
21 24. On September 5, 2017, the County issued a Final EIR on the project including
22 written and verbal comments to the Draft EIR that the County received from agencies,
23 organizations and individuals and the County's responses to each comment. 14 Cal. Reg. Code
24 § 15132(b). The County's Planning Department compounded its violation of CEQA Guidelines
25 by issuing the Final EIR without addressing the Draft EIR's fundamental flaws noted above. The
26 County's failure to revise its Draft EIR to analyze the Ban Ordinance's significant environmental
27 impacts and recirculate it for public comment before issuing the Final EIR violated CEQA
28 Guidelines. 14 Cal. Reg. Code § 15088.5(a)(4).

BN 31989089v7

25. The County Planning Commission held public hearing on September 28, 2017,
2 to consider a recommendation to the Board on commercial cannabis cultivation. After the
3 hearing, the County's Planning Commission rccommended two alternatives: (1) a revised Ban
4 Ordinance; and (2) a stricter Regulatory Ordinance.
5 26. On October 18, 2017, the Board convened a special meeting to consider the
6 County Planning Commission's recommendations. As County residents fiercely debated
commercial cannabis cultivation's within the County, Supervisors Mills and Clapp abruptly
8 exited the dais and the remaining Board Supervisors adjourned the Special Meeting. Petitioners
allege the Board ended the Special Meeting to consider Supervisor Mills' secretly prepared 60-
10 page anti-cannabis disquisition entitled "Cultivating Disaster."
11 27. Supervisor Mills commissioned The Commission Institute (*TCI"), a non-profit
12 corporation registered under Internal Revenue Code section 501(c)(3), to prepare the "Cultivating
13 Disaster" report. Supervisor Mills, however, conveniently withheld his close financial connection
14 to TCI at the October 18, 2017, special meeting. Supervisor Mills informed members of the
15| public in attendance that they could access a copy of the "Cultivating Disaster" report on the
16 website "silentpoison.com." Supervisor Mills also thanked "many volunteers" who spent
17 "countless hours" compiling the information in the "Cultivating Disaster" report, preparing it, and
18 disseminating it to the public. But, Supervisor Mills concealed that TCI commissioned this
19 volunteer workforce to prepare this report and host the website "silentpoison.com" as part of its
20 coordinated lobbying campaign against the Regulatory Ordinance.
21 28. On December 19, 2017, the Board held another special meeting to consider the
22 County Planning Commission's "equally weighted" alternatives on commercial cannabis
23 cultivation. After the public comment period ended, Supervisor Mills moved to adopt the Ban
24 Ordinance as revised by the County Planning Commission. Supervisor Clapp joined Supervisor
25 Mills' motion, but the other three Board Supervisors voted against Supervisor Mills' motion.
26 29. Two days later, the Board convened another special meeting to again consider the
27 County Planning Commission's "equally weighted" alternatives on commercial cannabis
28 cultivation. At the special meeting, Supervisor Gary Tofanelli moved to reconsider the County
BUCHALTER
A PROVESSIONAL CORPOKATION 8
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT
BN 31989089v7

Planning Commission's Ban Ordinance. County Counsel rightly informed the Board that it could
2 only reconsider the County Planning Commission's Ban Ordinance if: (1) County staff posted it
3 on a new agenda for future meeting; or (2) members of the public present at the December 19,
4 2017, were returned to chamber. Board Rule of Procedure No. 31. Despite this warning,
5 Supervisors Mills, Clapp, and Tofanelli voted in favor of Supervisor Tofanelli's reconsideration
6 motion.

7 30. The Board directed County Staff to insert new conditions to the County Planning
8 Commission's Ban Ordinance. Consistent with the Board's instructions, County Staff heavily
9| modified the County Planning Commission's Ban Ordinance and submitted it directly to the
10 Board for a future vote. County Staff, however, did not afford the County Planning Commission
11 an opportunity consider the revised version of its Ban Ordinance. The Board's decision to revise
12 the Ban Ordinance and bypass the County Planning Commission violated Government Code
13 section 65857.

14 31. On December 28, 2017, the County Staff published a notice in the County's
15 newspaper of record, the Valley Spring News, indicating that the Board scheduled a meeting for
16 January 10, 2018, to consider its revised Ban Ordinance. Under Government Code sections
17 65856, 65090, and 65094, the County Staff could not issue the notice until the County Planning
18 Commission made a recommendation on the revised Ban Ordinance. The County Staff's
19| premature notice did not provide any recommendations from the County Planning Commission,
20 thus, violating Government Code sections 65856, 605090, and 65094. Environmental Defense
21 Project of Sierra County v. County of Sierra, 158 Cal. App. 4th 877, 893 (2008).
22 32. On January 10, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. the Board convened a special meeting on
23| adopting an Ordinance to replace the County's Urgency Ordinance despite the invalid notice.
24 According to the County's Agenda, the Board planned to consider three items: (1) banning or
25| regulating cannabis cultivation; (2) certifying the Final EIR and adopting its findings of fact; and
26 (3) adopting the Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Plan or finding that adopting the ordinance
27 is exempt from CEQA. (Ex. A, pg. 2.) The Board consists of five Supervisors: (1) Michael
28| Oliveira; (2) Clapp; (3) Mills; (4) Gary Tofanelli; and (5) John Garamendi. In a 3-2 vote, the
BUCHALTER
A P RSSIONAL COMPORATION 9
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT
BN 31989089v7

Board voted to replace the Urgency Ordinance with the Ban Ordinance and certify the final EIR
2 with comments and responses. Three Board members, Supervisors Clapp, Mills, and Tofanelli,

3 voted in lock-step to end commercial cannabis cultivation consistent with their vociferous
historical opposition to the County's prior adoption of the Urgency Ordinance. Supervisor
Clapp's vote proved the decisive swing vote at the meeting, using his influence to protect his
6 blatant financial interest in banning commercial cannabis cultivation as described in more detail
7 below.

8 33. On January 11, 2018, the County's Planning Department submitted to the County
9 clerk a Notice of Determination noting that the Board approved the project entitled "Calaveras
10 County Medical Cannabis Cultivation and Commercial Ordinance" ("NOD"). (Ex. B, pg. 1.)
11 The County's slapdash NOD does not describe the project as banning commercial cannabis
12 cultivation consistent with the Board's vote. (Ex. B, pg. 1.) Instead, the County's Planning
13| Department noted the project represented "an ordinance regulating the cultivation and other
14| activities associated with medical cannabis." (Ex. B, pg. 1.) Equally problematic, the County's
15 NOD failed to indicate whether the "project" approved by the Board will have significant effect
16 on the environment or whether the Board adopted mitigation measures. (Ex. B, pg. 1.)
17 34. Petitioners have filed a proof of prior service of their written noticc to Respondents
18 about this action against them for violating CEQA Guidelines in approving the Ban Ordinance.
19 By serving this notice on Respondents, Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code
20 section 2167.5. A copy of the notice, together with the proof of service, is attached to this
21 Petition as Exhibit C and incorporated herein.
22 35, Petitioners have served a copy of the Petition to the California Attorney General
23 concurrently with this filing, hereby satisfying Public Resources Code section 21167.6.
24 36. As required under Public Resources Code section 21176.5, Petitioners have filed
25 and served their request to Respondents to prepare the record of administrative proceedings
26 relating to this action. A copy of Petitioners' request is attached to this Petition as Exhibit D and
27 incorporated herein.
28 37. Petitioners have exhausted all of their administrative remedies before bringing this

Petition by registering their objections to the County approving the Ban Ordinance. At all
2 relevant times in this Petition, Petitioners were members of Calaveras County Innovative Health
3 ("CCIH"), an unincorporated association of commercial cannabis cultivators. On June 9, 2017,
CCIH, on its and Petitioners' behalf, submitted written comments to the County's Draft EIR
raising the same objections that Petitioners reassert in this Petition. On June 14, 2017, Calaveras
6 County Alliance, Inc. ("CCA") also submitted written comments elucidating the fundamental
flaws in the County's Draft EIR, which Petitioners have recited in this Petition. All issues raised
in this Petition were timely raised to Respondents. Cal. Pub. Res. Code § 21177.

FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF

10 (Code of Civil Procedure 1094.5; Petition for Writ of Administrative Mandate)

11 38. Petitioners incorporate and re-allege all allegations above as if fully set forth

12 herein.

13 39. Petitioners are a entitled to a writ of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure section

14 1094.5 because: (a) the County proceeded without, or in excess of, its jurisdiction in adopting the

15 Ban Ordinance; (b) the County's proceedings below are based upon prejudicial abuse of

16 discretion; and (c) the County did not proceed in the manner required by law. Respondents'

17 respectfully request an order finding Respondents' actions, as described below, violated CEQA

18 guidelines and voiding the Board's certification of the final EIR and approval of the Ban

19 Ordinance.

20| A. THE COUNTY VIOLATED CEQA GUIDELINES IN ENACTING THE BAN
ORDINANCE
21 40. a The County failed to proceed in a manner required under the CEQA guidelines in
22 enacting the Ban Ordinance. The County's Draft EIR, which it readopted in its final EIR, suffers
23 from multiple fatal flaws.
24 41. An agency may abuse its discretion under CEQA either because it failed to comply
25 with CEQA or because it reached factual conclusions unsupported by substantial evidence. Pub.
26 Res. Code § 21168.5; Banning Ranch Conservancy v. City of New Port Beach, 2 Cal. 5th 918,

1 the Ban Ordinance.

2 a. The County's NOP Failed to Describe the Ban Ordinance

3 42. CEQA requires the lead agency tasked with controlling the preparation of an EIR
4 to include accurate description of the project and its probable environmental effects. Cal. Pub.
5 Res. Code §§ 21080.4(a), 21092.3; 14 Cal. Reg. Code § 15082. If the lead agency considers
6 multiple proposals, it must treat each proposal as separate "projects" and prepare a notice of
7 preparation identifying and describing each project.

8 43. The County's NOP characterizes the project as the "Medical Cannabis Cultivation
9 and Commerce Ordinance." It exclusively focuses on the Board's proposal to regulate cultivation
10 and related commercial medical cannabis activities, including distribution, manufacture, and
11 transportation. It, however, does not describe the Board's recently adopted proposal to permit
12 and to regulate recreational cannabis, while banning all commercial cannabis activity. The
13 County's failure to describe the Ban Ordinance impeded recipients from suggesting
14 environmental issues and alternatives and mitigation measures that the EIR should analyze. The
15 County's defective NOP compromised the environmental review process of the Ban Ordinance,
16 which the County should have remedied by revising and recirculating a CEQA compliant NOP.
17 44. The County's actions constitute prejudicial abuse of discretion in that the County
18 failed to proceed in the manner by law and rely upon finding not supported by substantial
19 evidence.
20| b. The County's Draft EIR Misleadingly Describes the Project

21 45. An EIR's project description must include: (1) the project location; (2) project
22 objectives; (3) project technical, economic, and environmental characteristics; and (4) intended
23| uses of the EIR. 14 Cal. Reg. Code § 15124. An accurate, stable, and finite project description
24 serves as the linchpin for an informative and legally sufficient EIR. "CEQA requires a lead
25 agency's Draft EIR include an accurate and stable project description so that the public and
26| decision makers have enough information to ascertain the environmentally significant effects,
27 assess ways of mitigating them, and consider project alternatives." Sierra Club v. City of Orange,
28 168 Cal. App. 4th 523, 533 (2008). In addition to requiring the project description be accurate
BUCHALTER
PROFESSIONAL 12
los ANGELES FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT
BN 31989089v7

and precise, CEQA also requires the project description be sufficiently comprehensive in scope
2 and complete. See County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles, 71 Cal. App. 3d 185, 192-93 (1977)
3 (finding the City of Los Angeles's Draft EIR description of a groundwater extraction project
4 imprecise where it shifted in lifferent parts of the EIR.)

5 46. Under Section 2 entitled "Project Description," the Draft EIR describes the project
as the Regulatory Ordinance. The Regulatory Ordinance explores a comprehensive set of
permanent regulations concerning the cultivation, manufacture, testing, distribution,
transportation, and storage of medical marijuana within the County. Yet in the same paragraph,
the Draft EIR switches its focus, explaining that the Board directed County Counsel and the
10 County Planning Department to prepare an ordinance banning commercial cannabis activity
11 within the County. The Draft EIR then proclaims that it may serve as an appropriate CEQA
12| document for adoption of an ordinance banning such activity even though it identifies the
13 Regulatory Ordinance as the Project. This proclamation, thus, suggests the County effectively
14 substituted the Ban Ordinance as the applicable project. As such, the Draft FIR's shifting
15 description of the "project" inadequately informed the public whether the applicable project being
16 evaluated was the Regulatory Ordinance or the Ban Ordinance.
17 C. The County's Draft EIR Omits Information Upon Which it Based its Ban
18 Ordinance Approval Findings

19 47. To ensure responsible agencies and the public have sufficient information to

20 evaluate the lead agency's EIR, CEQA obligates the lead agency to make its EIR's supporting

21 documents and data available for public review. See Cal. Pub. Res. Code § 21092(b)(1). When a

22 lead agency excludes its EIR's supporting documents and data, it deprives the public from

23 making informed comments upon the validity of the EIR's assessment of the proposed projects

24 and its feasible alternatives and mitigation measures. Ultramar, Inc. v. South Coast Air Quality

25 Mgmt Dist., 17 Cal. App. 4th 689, 699-700 (1993).

26 48. The County's draft EIR violated CEQA by omitting its data supporting multiple

27 topics including:

28| a. The number of employees assumed to be at cannabis farms during an entire

BUCHALTER
DI ESBIONAL. CORPORATION 13
ASCELES FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT
BN 31989089v7

harvest season;

b. The directions and times of employee commuting affecting traffic during
peak time and in peak directions;

C, The amount of emissions from employee vehicles and farm operations;
d. The acreage of land that will be used for farms;

e. The acreage of native vegetation that will be farms;

f. The number of permits expected to be approved;

g, The number of existing cannabis farms that were registered under the
Urgency Ordinance but are not expected to receive permits under the Regulatory Ordinance;
10 h. The conclusion that all existing cannabis farm sites will cease operation
11 under the Ban Ordinance;
12 i. The conclusion that all cannabis farm sites will be reclaimed to a condition
13 allowing for suitable subsequent use under the Ban Ordinance; and
14 j. The conclusion that all potentially-adverse environmental impacts of the
15 Ban Ordinance will be inconsequential.
16 d. The County's Draft EIR Fails to Disclose and Elucidate the Ban
17 Ordinance's Environmental Impacts

18 49. CEQA mandates that a lead agency's Draft EIR to include adequate information to

19 ensure it made an informed decision about a project. 4 Cal. Reg. Code § 15151. CEQA further

20| requires the lead agency to provide a reasonable, good faith disclosure and analysis of the

21 environmental impacts of the proposed project. 14 Cal. Reg. Code §§ 1544, 15151. The lead

22 agency must evaluate whether a proposed project will result in a significant short-term or a long-

23 term environmental impact based on substantial evidence. Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n v.

24 Regents of Univ. of Cal., 47 Cal. 3d 376 (1988). Under Public Resources Code section

25 21082.2(c), substantial evidence means "enough relevant information and reasonable inferences

26 from this information that a fair argument can be made to support a conclusion, even though other

27 conclusions might also be reached." 14 Cal. Reg. Code § 15384(a). CEQA's public review 28 process ensures "an apprchensive citizenry that the agency has, in fact, analyzed and considered
BUCHALTER
PHORESSIGNAl CORPURAI 1O 14

the ecological implications of its action. Envtl. Prot. Info. Ctr. V. Cal. Dept. of Forestry & Fire
2 Prot., 44 Cal. 4th 459, 486 (2008) (quoting Schoen v. Dept. of Forestry & Fire Prot., 58 Cal.
3 App. 4th 556, 573-74 (2008).)

50. Section 1.2.1 dentifies seven categories of effects the County found not to be
significant if the County were to adopt the Regulatory Ordinance. Those categories include:
(1) Agriculture and forestry resources; (2) Geology and Soils; (3) Hazards and Hazardous
Materials; (4) Mineral Resources; (5) Public Services; (6) Recreation; and (7) Utilities and
Service Systems. Although the County concluded that these seven categories would not produce
9 any significant environmental effect under the Regulatory Ordinance, the Draft EIR offers no
10 analysis supporting the related conclusion that the same result would also occur under the Ban
11 Ordinance. The Draft EIR omitted any discussion of these categories of potential impacts vis-a-
12 vis the Ban Ordinance, in violation of CEQA. See Banning Ranch Conservancy, 2 Cal. 5th at
13 935-37 (rejecting an EIR ignoring consideration of a project's impacts on environmentally
14 sensitive habit areas under the Coastal Act.) The problems with County's dubious overall
15 approach become pellucid when analyzing its consideration of five of the seven identified
16 categories:

17 a. Agriculture and Forestry Resources: The Draft EIR fails to include
18 any estimates or analysis of the loss of agricultural or forestry resources due to continued
19| unregulated cannabis cultivation under the Ban Ordinance. Specifically, the Draft EIR failed to
20| identify and evaluate multiple potential environmental impacts on agricultural and forestry
21 resources. Those include: (1) unregulated diversion of water sources; (2) harm to sensitive
22 habitats and species; (3) incrcased wildfire risk; and (4) increased greenhouse gas and other

23 pollutant emissions from fossil fuel generators, equipment, and vehicles. Such activity is a clear a
24 and foreseeable consequence of the Ban Ordinance according to the Draft EIR.
25 b. Geology and Soils: The Draft EIR fails to include any analysis
26 whatsoever of the potential impact of continued unregulated cannabis cultivation activities under
27 the Ban Ordinance. For example, the Draft EIR fails to consider the environmental impact of
28 unregulated grading and removal of vegetation. Similarly, the Draft EIR fails to consider the
BUCHALTER
PROIESSIONAL CORPORATION 15
LC AXGRLES FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT
BN 31989089v7

water quality impacts from erosion, erosion impacts from poorly graded farm sites; and biological
2 impacts to flora and fauna.

3 C. Hazards and Hazardous Materials: The Draft EIR provides no
analysis of hazardous materials-related impacts which may result from continued unregulated
5 cultivation activities under the Ban Ordinance. For example, the Draft EIR ignores the
reasonably foreseeable environmental impacts of large-scale collection and disposal of equipment
and soil contaminated by pesticide and herbicide residue. Additionally, the Draft EIR ignores
8 that former cannabis cultivators remediating their sites may cause multiple hazard related
9 environmental impacts threatening the County's air and water quality.
10 d. Public Services: The Draft EIR does not analyze the demand for
11 government services or impacts to the provision of existing services which may result from
12 continued unregulated cannabis cultivation activities under the Ban Ordinance. In this regard, the
13 Draft EIR does not evaluate the secondary impacts associated with the Ban Ordinance based on
14 the reasonably foresecable inability of the County to provide necessary governmental services to
15 address continued cannabis cultivation activities. These impacts would be further exacerbated
16 under the Ban Ordinance as a result of the County's need to refund registration fees paid under
17 the Urgency Ordinance and the Measure C tax revenues already paid. Notably, the Draft EIR
18 ignores the reasonably foresecable environmental impacts on public safety resulting from the Ban
19 Ordinance. Those include: (1) unregulated use of dangerous security measures by still-operating
20 cannabis farms; and (2) hazards remaining on property by abandoned cannabis farms.
21 e. Utilities and Service Systems: The Draft EIR does not include any
22 analysis of the demand for utilities and service systems or impacts to provision of existing utilities
23 which may result from continued unregulated cannabis cultivation activities.
24 51. The County had sufficient information available in the public record to determine
25 that the effects found not to be significant in the Draft EIR for the Regulatory Ordinance in fact
26 may be potentially significant under the Ban Ordinance. As such, the County's Draft EIR lacked
27 sufficient information to give the public a meaningful review of the Ban Ordinance. CEQA, thus,
28 commanded the County to revise the EIR to evaluate all of the foresecable impacts of the Ban
BUCHALTER
PRCFESSIOSar C 16
Los ANGSl.Es FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT
BN 31989089v7

Ordinance and then to recirculate the EIR for additional comment before approving the Ban
2 Ordinance. The County's failure to do so violated CEQA.

52. Also violating CEQA, the Draft EIR engages in piecemeal environmental review,
chiefly focusing on the Regulatory Ordinance, while devoting scant analysis to the Ban
5 Ordinance. CEQA forbids segmenting environmental review so that the cumulative impacts of an

6 entire project will be included in the County's studies of impacts and disclosed to the public. The
EIR ignored the cumulative effects of the Ban Ordinance together with an ordinance to regulate
8 medical cannabis dispensaries. Preventing new dispensaries and perhaps closing three medical
cannabis dispensaries in the County will further reduce the County's residents' access to medical
10 cannabis. This change will likely cause a surge in residential cannabis cultivation. Relatedly, this
11 change will cause the County's residents to drive further distances to each the limited number of
12 medical cannabis sites within or outside the County. The County's failure to analyze together the
13 impacts of the Ban Ordinance and regulations targeting medical cannabis dispensaries constitutes
14| impermissible segmenting.

15 53. The Draft EIR paradoxically claims the Ban Ordinance will not cause any
16 significant environmental impacts and yet recognizes that such impacts may occur from illegal
17 activity. Most telling, the Draft EIR's findings recognize that illegal cannabis cultivation may
18 cause numerous environmental impacts, but it claims they are too speculative to analyze their
19 potential significance. These internally inconsistent findings confirm the County Planning
20 Commission should have revised its Draft EIR and recirculated it for public comment.
21 f. The County's Failure to Revise and to Recirculate its Draft EIR

22 54. CEQA requires a lead agency to a recirculate a draft EIR released for public
23 comment under four scenarios. Those include: (1) significant new information is added; (2) new
24 information is received showing that impacts of a project would be new or more severe than
25 described in the EIR; (3) new information indicates the need for such studies to correct omissions;
26 and (4) the draft EIR was so fundamentally and basically inadequate to preclude "meaningful
27| public review." 14 Cal. Reg. Code § 15088.5(a).
28 55. As described above, CEQA required that the Draft EIR be recirculated because

BUCHALTER
FROFESSIONAL CORPOKATION 17
1.O5 AXCELAS FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT
BN 31989089v7

Respondents received new information showing that impacts of a project would be new or more
2 severe than described in the Draft EIR. This new information rendered the Draft EIR so
3 fundamentally and basically inadequate to preclude the public's "meaningful public review."
56. The County Planning Commission should analyze the potentially significant
environmental impacts of the Ban Ordinance and feasibility alternatives and mitigation measures

6 to alleviate those impacts. The County Planning Commission should also include this analysis in
a revised EIR and recirculate it to the public for further review.

8 C. The County's NOD Violates CEQA Guidelines

57. After deciding to approve project for which an EIR has been approved, a lead
10| agency must file a Notice of Determination. Pub. Res. Code § 21108(a); 14 Cal. Reg. Code
11 § 15097(g). CEQA directs leads agencies to include ten categories of information in a notice of
12 determination, three of which the County's NOD violated. First, the lead agency's notice of
13 determination must briefly describe the project. 14 Cal. Reg. Code § 15094(b)(2). Second, the
14 lead agency's notice of determination must indicate whether the project in its approved form will
15 have significant effect on the environment. 14 Cal. Reg. Code § 15094(b)(4). Lastly, the lead
16 agency's notice of determination must indicate whether mitigation measures were made a

17 condition of the project's approval. 14 Cal. Reg. Code 15094(b)(6).
18 58. The County's NOD violates all three requirements. Although the Board voted to
19| approve the Ban Ordinance, the County's NOD instead describes the approved project as "an
20 ordinance regulating the cultivation and other activities associated with medical cannabis." (Ex.

21 B, pg. 1.) This shorthand summary of the approved project appears to refer to the Regulatory
22 Ordinance, rather than Ban Ordinance. Moreover, the County's NOD leaves blank line item
23| indicating whether the unclearly described project will have a significant effect on the
24 environment. (Ex. B, pg. 1.) Similarly, the County's NOD does not confirm whether it made
25 mitigation measures a condition of approval of the unclearly described project. (Ex. B, pg. 1.)
26 The County's NOD presents yet another CEQA violation in its race to enact the Ban Ordinance.

SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF
2 (Code of Civil Procedure § 1085; Petition for Writ of Administrative Mandate)
59. Petitioners incorporate and re-allege all allegations above as if fully set forth

herein.

60. Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, subdivision (a) authorizes this Court to
issue a writ of mandate ordering the County to comply with applicable law, which enjoins the
County and the Board Supervisors from engaging in any act the law specifically bars. This
section specifically empowers this Court to mandate the Board of Supervisors to perform clear
and present ministerial duties imposed by law or to enjoin acts prohibited by law.

10 61. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy at law and are entitled to

11 mandamus relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 on two grounds.

12 A. THE COUNTY'S CERTIFICATION OF ITS FINAL EIR AND APPROVAL OF
THE BAN ORDINANCE VIOLATED CEQA GUIDELINES
13 62. As noted above, CEQA guidelines obligated the County's Planning Department to
14 accurately, precisely, and comprehensively describc the proposed project, the Ban Ordinance, in
15 the County's Draft EIR. 14 Cal. Reg. Code §§ 1544, 15151. In addition CEQA guidelines
16 directed the County's Planning Department to consider and disclose in the County's Draft EIR all
17 the reasonably foreseeable environmental impacts of the County's Ban Ordinance. 14 Cal. Reg. 18 Code §§ 1544, 15151. The County's exclusion of all the reasonably foreseeable environmental
19 impacts of the County's Ban Ordinance impeded the public and the requisite public agency's
20| review of the County's Draft EIR. 14 Cal. Reg. Code § 15088.5(a)(4). As such, CEQA
21 mandated the County's Planning Department to examine all the reasonably foreseeable
22 environmental impacts of the County's Ban Ordinance in a revised EIR and recirculate it for
23 review and comment. Id.; Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of
24 California, 6 Cal. 4th 1112, 1129 (1993) [Laurel Heights 1l]. This Court may issue a writ under

B. SUPERVISOR CLAPP'S FAILURE TO ABSTAIN FROM VOTING ON THE

2 COUNTY'S BAN ORDINANCE AND FINAL EIR RENDERS THE BOARD'S
APPROVAL INVALID

63. On December 5, 2016, Supervisor Clapp was sworn in as a member of the
County's Board. On January 3, 2017, Supervisor Clapp filed a Statement of Economic Interests
(FPPC Form 700) with the Fair Political Practices Commission, disclosing his ownership of 11
parcels of Property within the County. When Supervisor Clapp filed this form, one of his parcels,
located at 1521 County View Drive in Valley Springs, California, abutted a registered
commercial cannabis farm. Since he commenced his term on the Board, Supervisor Clapp has
repeatedly fulminated against the commercial cannabis cultivation industry's negative impact on
10| real property in the County, including his own, at multiple Board meetings.
11 a. At a January 24, 2017 meeting, Supervisor Clapp stated, "I have
12 property right now that I can't rent because of pot farms;"
13 b. At a January 31, 2017 meeting, after claiming the costs associated
14| with cannabis-related fires and criminal prosecutions were about $5 million, respectively,
15 Supervisor Clapp stated, "and wo're probably going to lose almost the same on our tourist costs
16 and stuff to people like me who can't rent property and stuff because of it.;"
17 C. At a February 14, 2017 meeting, Supervisor Clapp reiterated that "I
18 do have [a commercial grower] next door to me," and later stated, "commercial pot has no
19| business where I live;" and
20 d. At a February 28, 2017 meeting, while discussing cannabis policy,
21 Supervisor Clapp stated, "I don't like what's happened to my neighborhood. My neighborhood is
22 horrible the last 12 months."

23 64. In addition to Supervisor Clapp's public statements, he has voted in favor of
24 concrete steps to ban commercial cultivation in the County:
25 a. On January 31, 2017, Supervisor Clapp voted to direct County Staff
26 to prepare a "total ban" ordinance;"
27 b. On April 18, 2017, Supervisor Clapp voted to dissolve an ad hoc
28

BUCHALTER
A PRUPESSIONAL CONPORATION 20
L.dS ANGELES FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT
BN 31989089v7

Committee of Supervisors that had been formed to study a permanent successor to the Urgency
2 Ordinance as an alternative to the ban;" and

C. On January 10, 2018, Supervisor Clapp voted in favor of the Ban
Ordinance.

65. California Code of Regulations section 87100 prohibits public officials from
participating in governmental decisions in which they have a financial interest. California Code
of Regulations section 81703 in turn expounds a public official's disqualifying financial interest.
Under this section, a public official has a financial interest in a decision if it is reasonably
foreseeable that the decision will have a material financial effect on the public official. This
10| section includes three examples of disqualifying financial interest, one of which applies here. A
11 public official must abstain from voting on a decision, which may materially affect any real
12| property in which the public official has a direct or indirect interest worth more than $2,000.
13 66. California Code of Regulations section 18701 precludes public official from
14 participating in a governmental decision if it will have a reasonably foresecable financial effect.
15 A financial effect is reasonably foreseeable that it "can be recognized it as a realistic possibility
16 more than hypothetical or theoretical." 2 Cal. Reg. Code § 18701(b).
17 67. Supervisor Clapp has publicly acknowledged at multiple Board meetings that the
18| County's existing commercial cannabis regulations have dissuaded prospective tenants from
19 renting his income-producing property. Based on his avowed criticism of commercial cannabis,
20 Supervisor Clapp's ability to impartially review and vote on the Ban Ordinance and certifying the
21 EIR were compromised before the January 10, 2018, Board meeting. His coordinated efforts to
22 ban commercial cannabis cultivation aimed to enrich himself by improving the profitability of his
23| rental properties. His words and conduct support a reasonable inference that the Ban Ordinance
24 will have an impact on his financial interests. As such, Supervisor Clapp had a mandatory a duty
25 under California Code of Regulations sections 18700 and 18700 to abstain from voting on the
26 Ban Ordinance and certifying the final EIR with its underlying factual findings.
27 68. Excluding Supervisor Clapp's vote, the Board's final vote on the Planning
28 Commission's recommendation to approve the Ban Ordinance and certify the County's final EIR
BUCHALTER

tallied 2-2. As such, the Planning Commission's recommendation should have been deemed
2 rejected by operation of law. Cal. Gov't. Code §§ 54952.6, 65857.
3 C. SUPERVISOR MILLS' FAILURE TO ABSTAIN FROM VOTING ON THE COUNTY'S BAN ORDINANCE AND FINAL EIR RENDERS THE BOARD'S
APPROVAL INVALID

69. Similar to Supervisor Clapp, Supervisor Mills could not vote on the Ban
Ordinance because he had a disqualifying conflict of interest under California Code of
Regulations section 81703. Based upon this disqualifying conflict of interest, Supervisor Mills
8 should have abstained from voting on the Ban Ordinance.

70. On information and belief, Petitioners allege that TCI bestowed gifts to Supervisor
10 Mills exceeding $500 within a 12-month period before he voted on the Ban Ordinance at the
11 January 10, 2018, special meeting. California Code of Regulations section 18940 defines gift as
12 "a good or service that provides a personal benefit to an official when the official does not
13 provide full considerations for the value of the benefit received." 2 Cal. Reg. Code § 18940 (a).
14 This section further specifics that "gift includes... & discount in the price of anything of value
15 unless the .. . discount is offered in the ordinary course of business without regard to official
16 status." ld. Under Government Code section 87103(c), "a public official has a financial interest
17 if it is reasonably foresceable that the decision will have a material financial effect.. . on any
18 source of income [exceeding $500] . . . within 12 months [before the decision]." Six factors
19l guide the assessment of the reasonable foreseeability of a governmental decision's financial effect
20 on the public official's financial interest, one of which amply applies here. "Whether a
21 reasonable inference can be made that the financial effects of the government decision on the
22 public official's financial interest might compromise a public official's ability to act in a manner
23 consistent with his ... duty to act in the [public] best interests." 2 Cal. Reg. Code §18701(b). As
24l to the source of a gift to public official, the financial effect of a government decision is material
25 if "the source is a nonprofit that will receive a measurable financial benefit or loss." 2 Cal. Reg.
26 Code § 18702.4(c). If a public official receives a gift satisfying these criteria, then the gift will
27 disqualify the public official from participating in such decision. 2 Cal. Reg. Code § 18940(c);
28

BN 31989089v7

Cal. Gov. Code § 87100; Cal. Gov. Code 87103(c).
2 71. In July 2017, TCI devised an extensive lobbying campaign on Supervisor Mills'
3 behalf designed to influence and change County residents' views on commercial cannabis. TCI
mobilized numerous volunteers to implement its grassroots campaign advocating County
residents to support the Ban Ordinance. TCI volunteers prepared the "Cultivating Disaster"
6 report, coordinated newspaper articles criticizing the commercial cannabis industry, and hosted
the website "spinpoison.com" to disseminate further information about the report. TCI's gifts to
8 Supervisor Mills include: (1) the "Cultivating Disaster report; (2) a complete public relations
package supporting the report; (3) newspaper articles and editorials; and (4) the website
10 "spinpoison.com." Supervisors Mills should have paid TCI the fair market value of these gifts
11 that TCI conferred to Supervisor Mills within 12 months before he voted on the Ban Ordinance.
12 On information and belief, Petitioners allege that TCI a gave Supervisors a substantial discount on
13 these direct and grassroots lobbying campaign gifts, which far exceeds the $500 limit.
14 72. Supervisor Mills should have reasonably foreseen that his financial interest in TCI,
15 based upon its gifts, would materially affect his ability to vote impartially on the Ban Ordinance.
16 Indeed, after the October 18, 2017, special meeting, Supervisor Mills issued multiple press
17 statements to different news outlets promoting TCI and praising its work in preparing the
18 "Cultivation Disaster" report. At a January 2, 2018, rally in Sacramento organized by Jack Cox,
19 TCI's CEO, Supervisor Mills expressed his intention to continue working with "other rural-
20| county leaders to address the issues raised in the "Cultivation Disaster" report. On information
21 and belief, Supervisor Mills used this report to influence the other Board Supervisors' vote on the
22 Ban Ordinance and to further enhance TCI's public profile. Supervisor Mills' decision conferred
23 a measurable benefit on TCI through favorable press releases promoting TCI's ability to influence
24| policy in legislation proposed in "other rural counties." Supervisor Mills should have reasonably
25 forseen that his vote on the Ban Ordinance would have material effect on his financial interest in
26 the source of the disqualifying gifts, TCI. Supervisor Mills, thus, should have abstained from
27| voting on the Ban Ordinance.
28 73. Excluding Supervisor Mills' vote, the Board's final vote on the Planning

1 Commission's recommendation to approve the Ban Ordinance and certify the County's final EIR
2 tallied 2-2. As such, the Planning Commission's recommendation should have been deemed
3 rejected by operation of law. Cal. Gov't. Code §§ 54952.6, 65857.
4 D. THE COUNTY'S NON-COMPLIANCE WITH CALIFORNIA LAWS
5 PROCEDURAL AND SUBSTANTIVE REQUIREMENTS FOR ADOPTING A ZONING AMENDMENT
6 74. Government Code sections 65854 and 65855 require the local jurisdiction's
7 planning commission to hold a public hearing on any proposed zoning ordinance amendment and
8 prepare a written recommendation to its board of supervisors. The board of supervisors must then
hold its own public hearing on the proposed zoning ordinance amendment, and include in its
10 notice the planning commission's recommendation. Cal. Gov't. Code $ 65090. § If the board of
11 supervisors later materially modifies the planning commission's proposed zoning ordinance
12 amendment, it must refer the matter back to its planning commission for further review. Cal.
13 Gov't. § Code $ 65857.
14 75. On November 29, 2017, the County's Planning Commission held a public hearing
15 and recommended the Board consider adopting either the Regulatory or the Ban Ordinance. The
16 Board did not adopt either proposal. Instead at its January 10, 2017, special meeting, the Board
17 adopted its own materially modified version of the Ban Ordinance. Juxtaposing the Board's Ban
18 with the County's Planning Commission's Ban Ordinance reveals multiple, material differences
19 Unlike the County Planning Commission's Ban Ordinance, the Board's Ban Ordinance:
20| (1) imposes joint and several duties on cultivators and landowners to restore or purpose
21 cultivation sites; (2) only permits six plants on any one parcel, regardless how many housing units

4 THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF
5 (Violation for California Constitution Article L, § 7)
77. Petitioners incorporate and re-allege all allegations above as if fully set forth
herein.

8 78. Petitioners bring this cause of action pursuant to Article 1, section 7 of the
California Constitution, which provides that a person may not be deprived of life, liberty, or

10 property without due process. The County's actions, as outlined above and below, entitle

11 Petitioners to recover damages against the County for violation of their personal property rights

12 without due process of law.

13 79. The County was, at all times mentioned in this Petition herein, acting under and

14 under State law.

15 80. Petitioners were and are, at all times mentioned in this Petition, property owners in

16 Calaveras County and leased such properties to individuals or businesses that cultivated cannabis

17 pursuant to a license granted to Petitioners by the County for such activity. Under their licenses,

18 Petitioners, and their lessees, expended substantial sums to engage in the cannabis cultivation

19 industry.

20 81. Petitioners had a continuing and reasonable expectation that they would be

21 allowed to cultivate cannabis under the express terms of their license and the licensing scheme

22 imposed by the County. The County imposed strict requirements on Petitioners, to do, among

23 other things, provide personal information about Petitioners such as driver's license numbers,

24 waivers of their Constitutional right to have their land free from search without cause by the

25 County, and consent to a criminal background check. If a Ban Ordinance was enacted, there was

26 no reasonable expectation that Petitioners would be required to expend substantial resources to

27 comply with the then non-existent Ban Ordinance without Due Process of law.

28 82. On January 10, 2018, the County's Board adopted the Ban Ordinance four months

after Petitioners obtained their licenses. The Ban Ordinance will terminate Petitioners licenses.

2 83. Petitioners are required to undertake nine onerous legislatively mandated
3 remediation measures until the County deems their properties suitable for subsequent use. The
Ban Ordinance's remediation mandates confer the County the right to control Petitioners
remediation efforts over their properties. Petitioners had no personal notice that such
Constitutional deprivation would occur as to them specifically, no opportunity to be heard or
present evidence as to their specific properties as to why such remediation is appropriate, or
8 otherwise be provided notice or heard regarding these remedial mandates.
84. The County's violation of Petitioners' Due Process Rights will cause Petitioners
10 substantial damages in an amount to be proven at the time of trial.

11 PRAYER FOR RELIEF
12 WHEREFORE, Petitioners respectfully request that the Court enter judgment in their
13 favor as follows:

14 1. For a Peremptory Writ of Mandate to be issued under Code of Civil Procedure
15 sections 1085 and 1094.5 ordering:
16 (a) The County, by and through the Board Supervisors, to immediately vacate

18 (b) The County, by and through the Board Supervisors, to immediately vacate
19 and set aside its certification of the final EIR;
20 (c) The County, by through its Board Supervisors, to revise its Draft EIR to
21 address of the potentially significant environmental impacts of the Ban Ordinance;
22 (d) The County, by and through its Board Supervisors to prepare and
23 recirculate a legally adequate Draft EIR;
24 (e) The County, by and through its Board Supervisors, to suspend all activity
25 under the Ban Ordinance that could result in any change or alteration in the physical environment
26 until the County has taken actions that may be necessary to bring the Ban Ordinance into
27 compliance with CEQA; and

SECTIÓN 2: SEVERABILITY

If any part or subsection of this chapter is for any reason held to be invalid, unlawful, or
unconstitutional, such invalidity, unlawfulness, or unconstitutionality shall not affect the
validity, lawfulness, or constitutionality of any other part of this chapter.

SECTION 3: FINDINGS
The Board of Supervisors of the County of Calaveras finds and declares as follows:

A. The Federal Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. §§ 801 et seq., classifies cannabis (or marijuana) as a Schedule I Drug, which is defined as a drug or other
substance that has a high potential for abuse, that has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and that has not been accepted as safe
for use under medical supervision.

B The Federal Controlled it Substances Act makes it unlawful, under federal law, for any
person to cultivate, manufacture, distribute or dispense, or possess with Intent to
manufacture, distribute or dispense, marijuana or cannabis. The Federal Controlled
Substances Act contains no exemption for the cultivation, manufacture,
distribution, dispensation, or possession of marijuana or cannabis for medical or
recreational purposes.

C. On October 19, 2009, then-Attorney General David W. Ogden issued a
memorandum directing federal prosecutors in states with medical cannabis
regulations to deprioritize the prosecution of compliant businesses and individuals. Substantively similar memoranda were subsequently issued by then- Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole and became known collectively as "the Cole memos". The Cole memo, while not providing a defènse against potential federal enforcement, professed tolerance of state schemes to regulate medical cannabis so long as they
were sufficiently stringent to protect against the types of cannabis-related activity deemed a priority by the federal government. To date, the Cole memos have not been rescinded or replaced.

D. On December 16, 2014, then-President Barack H. Obama signed the Consolidated
and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2015, containing language known as the
Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment, which prohibits the expenditure of federal funds to
prosecute cases against medical cannabis patients and providers, including
businesses, in states where medical cannabis use is legal. The Rohrabacher-Farr
Amendment has been repeatedly renewed and extended by both the former and current
administrations and was extended most recently on December 22, 2017. There are, to
date, no federal policies protecting against federal enforcement of the Controlled
Substances Acl in the recreational cannabis context.

E. In 1996, the voters of the State of California approved Proposition 215, "The Compassionate Use Act", (codified as Health and Safety Code Section 11362.5), which was intended to decriminalize cultivation and possession of medical cannabis
by a seriously ill patient, or the patient's primary caregiver, for the patient's personal use, and to create a limited defense to the crimes of possessing or cultivating cannabis. The Act further provided that nothing in it shall be construed to supersede legislation prohibiting persons from engaging in conduct that endangers others, or to condone the diversion of cannabis for non- medical purposes.

F. The State enacted SB 420 in 2004 (known as the "Medical Marijuana Program Act", codified as Health and Safety Code Section 11362.7 et seq.) to expand and clarify the scope of The Compassionate Use Act of 1996 by creating the Medical Marijuana

Identification Card program, creating reasonable regulations for cultivating, processing, transporting and administering cannabis, as well as limiting the amount of cannabis a qualified individual may possess.

G Health & Safety Code §11362.7 defines a "primary caregiver" as an a individual who is designated by a qualified patient or by a person with an identification card, and who
has consistently assumed responsibility for the housing, health, or safety of that
patient or person and is further defined in the California Supreme Court decision
People.v. Mentch (2008) 45 Cal.4th 274.

H. The State enacted the Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act (MMRSA) on September 11, 2015 (SB 643, AB 266, and AB 243), instituting a comprehensive
state-level licensure and regulatory scheme for cultivation, manufacturing,
distribution, transportation, laboratory testing, and dispensing of medical cannabis
through numerous changes and additions to the Business & Professions Code and
the Health and Safety Code. MMRSA legalized and regulated for-profit commercial activity related to medical cannabis in California. MMRSA has been subsequently amended and renamed the Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety
Act (MCRSA).

l. While, prior to May 10. 2016, Calaveras County had never adopted a local
ordinance allowing or regulating cannabis cultivation within the County (or other
cannabis activities aside from medical cannabis dispensaries), there had been for
many years several hundred unregulated cannabis cultivation sites within the County.
While these cultivation sites were unlawful under principles of permissive zoning
and County Code 17.04.010, some growers have argued they were legal because
they were not expressly banned. The adoption of this ordinance will serve to clarify
which cannabis cultivation activities the County expressly intends to allow and which
ones it expressly intends to prohibit.
J. When MMRSA was originally enacted on January 1, 2016, it contained a provision requiring local governments to either adopt a local regulatory scheme for medical cannabis activities by March 1, 2016 or the State would become "the sole licensing
authority" for these activities.

K. Throughout the State of California, many cities and counties, including cities and counties surrounding Calaveras County, quickly adopted local urgency ordinances
banning or severely restricting medical cannabis activities within their boundaries.

L. On February 3, 2016, the Governor of California signed Assembly Bill 21, removing
the March 1st deadline for counties and cities to develop their own regulatory
schemes.

M. On February 16, 2016, the Board of Supervisors, at an open public meeting,
directed the County Counsel's Office to draft an ordinance allowing but regulating medical cannabis cultivation and commercial uses involving medical cannabis
within the jurisdictional boundaries of Calaveras County. This ordinance required the preparation of a programmatic environmental impact report it before it could be adopted

and implemented, and this process had the potential to take more than a year to
complete.

N. Meanwhile, in the wake of the Board of Supervisor's February 16, 2016 directive to
prepare an ordinance allowing medical cannabis cultivation, Calaveras County
experienced a marked influx of people who were escaping the new regulatory bans of medical cannabis cultivation in neighbaring jurisdictions, purchasing and leasing
real estate within the County, and seeking 1o use these properties to cultivate medical cannabis in anticipation of the County's new ordinance. There had also been a steep rise in land speculation by existing local growers who were buying
inexpensive properties affected by the Butte Fire and seeking to move or expand
their cultivation sites beyond the ones they have already created. There was a
concern that these trends were contributing to an unstudied, unregulated, and
potentially significant impact on the environment.

O Meanwhile, the County's geographic and climatic conditions, which include dense
forested areas with adequate precipitation and mild winters, provide conditions that are favorable to outdoor cannabis cultivation, allowing growers to achieve a high per-
plant yield.

P. As a means of mitigating the impact of the influx of growers pending final adoption of
an Environmental Impact Report on the proposed permanent regulatory scheme for cannabis cultivation and commerce, the Board of Supervisors, on May 10, 2016, adopted an interim urgency ordinance authorizing temporary fee-based
registrations for existing cannabis cultivation sites and requiring strict compliance
with local and state laws designed to protect the public and the environment until a permanent ordinance was adopted. The applications were lengthy in order to capture the extensive compliance criteria, and the processing of each application was, as a result, highly labor-intensive.

Q. As a result of 1) most neighboring jurisdictions having continued to ban or severely
restrict commercial cannabis cultivation. 2) a sustained unusual availability of
inexpensive land for sale that was suitable for cannabis cultivation, and 3) the
approximately three-month gap between the day the regulatory scheme was publicly announced and the May 10, 2016 cut-off date for having a prepared cultivation site
that could qualify for registration under it, the influx into the county of new growers
continued, and approximately three times the expected number of registration
applications were submitted to the Planning Department. Fewer than 300 were
expected, but approximately 900 were received.

R. Almost half of the registration applications thus far processed by the Planning Department have resulted in a denial of the application after further investigation revealed disqualifying circumstances concerning the site or the grower. Thus, the imposition of strict regulations and a three-month timeframe to comply did not adequately disincentivize unqualified cannabis cultivators from paying the registration fee and gambling that their disqualifying conditions would remain
unnoticed. The unexpected influx of additional growers, which included an influx of

unqualified growers, has been correlated with an increase in cannabis-related • crime,
including but not limited to robbery, assault, and murder.

S This unexpected number of registration applications, some legitimate and some not, overwhelmed the County's ability to quickly process the applications to determine if the sites met all of the qualification criteria of the urgency ordinance. The application
burden far outpaced the ability of the Planning Department, Code Enforcement, and
the Sheriff's Department, even with additional proceeds from registration fees, to
hire, train, and retain an adequate number of new staff members to review
applications, conduct background checks and inspect proposed sites while also
continuing their other day-to-day duties.

T. A significant number of registration applications for the 2016 cultivation season
remain unprocessed to date, and now a second cannabis harvest has concluded.
U. The knowledge that County staff is overwhelmed by the application burden will likely incentivize those whose sites or whose criminal background do not qualify for registration, but whose applications have not yet been processed, to continue growing
cannabis despite having substandard sites or disqualifying circumstances that would negate the protections intended by the urgency ordinance.

V. On November 8, 2016, the voters of California adopted Proposition 64, "The
Control, Regulate and Tax Adult Use of Marijuana Act" (AUMA), which requires local jurisdictions to allow its residents to cultivate up to six cannabis plants indoors
non-commercially for recreational use. AUMA retained the right of local jurisdictions
to impose reasonable regulations on recreational cultivation and imposes a
comprehensive statewide regulatory scheme on recreational cannabis use and
commerce.

W. On November 8, 2016 the voters of Calaveras County adopted a measure to tax
commercial cannabis businesses within the County but rejected a voter initiative
seeking to establish a permanent regulatory ordinance that allowed more uses in more
zones than the existing urgency ordinance.

X. In January 2017, another County voter initiative, Measure B, qualified for the May 2017
ballot seeking to ban commercial cannabis within the County. The newly elected Board of Supervisors called a special election to allow the people to vote on the
initiative.

Y. In February 2017, the Board of Supervisors directed staff to prepare a permanent
ordinance banning commercial cannabis cultivation and other commercial cannabis
uses within the County (other than medical cannabis dispensaries, which remain
regulated under a separate chapter of the County Code). Meanwhile, the Board
voted to extend the Urgency Ordinance as allowed by state law to provide the time required to prepare and adopt a ban without existing regulations lapsing.

Z On March 28, 2017, after a legal challenge was filed by a member of the public, the Calaveras County Superior Court ordered Measure B stricken from the ballot after
finding some of its language to be impermissibly misleading.

AA. On June 27, 2017, the Medical and Adult Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (MAUCRSA) was enacted, intended to reconcile the differences between previously enacted state regulations. MAUCRSA was further amended on September 16, 2017. On November 16, 2017, the state adopted emergency regulations to implement MAUCRSA. Under the current state law cannabis regulatory scheme, counties are required to allow the indoor cultivation of at least six cannabis plants per residence, but counties are still

BB. permitted to impose regulations on this activity. The rapid changes to cannabis-related state laws over the last two years; the
concomitant transitioning of an illegal industry utilizing illegal cultivation and industry
practices to a legal industry adopting legal cultivation and industry practices; and the uncertainty concerning federal enforcement policies, final state law requirements, and
the effectiveness of the state's implementation and enforcement of MAUCRSA further
justify the imposition of a ban on most commercial cannabis businesses within the
County.

CC. Children (minor under the age of 18) are particularly vulnerable to the effects of cannabis use and the presence of cannabis plants or products is an attractive nuisance for children, creating an unreasonable hazard in areas frequented by
children (including schools, parks, and other similar locations). The cultivation of
cannabis, including non-commercial cannabis, at locations deemed "sensitive
uses" under Chapter 17.91 of the County Code creates unique risks that the
cannabis plants may be observed by juveniles, and therefore, be especially
vulnerable to theft or recreational consumption by juveniles. Further, the potential
for criminal activities associated with the cultivation or distribution of cannabis in
the proximity of such locations poses heightened risks that juveniles will be involved
or endangered.

DD. The prohibition of commercial cannabis cultivation in the unincorporated area of
Calaveras County is necessary to protect the health, safety, and well-being of the County, its residents and its environment. Furthermore, comprehensive regulation
of the premises used for non-commercial cannabis cultivation is necessary to protect
the health, safety, and well-being of the County, its residents and environment by reducing risks associated with criminal activity, degradation of the natural
environment malodorous smelis, and electrical fire hazards.

EE. As cannabis plants begin to flower, and for a period of approximately two months or
more during the growing season, they produce an extremely strong odor that is
offensive to many people and detectable well beyond property boundaries upon which they are grown. The strong odor of cannabis may create an attractive
nuisance, alerting individuals to the location of plants, thereby creating the risk of potential crimes such as burglary, robbery, armed robbery, assault, attempted
murder, and murder.

FF. Comprehensive prohibition of commercial activities related to cannabis, including but not limited to the manufacture of cannabis products, distribution of cannabis, storage of cannabis, testing of cannabis, and commercial transport of cannabis, is proper to address the risks and adverse impacts associated with such activities, which include

but are not limited to risks related to the concentration of large amounts of cannabis on a single premises, fire hazards, and toxin release hazards.
GG. Illegal, unregulated outdoor cannabis cultivation, especially within the
foothills, is negatively impacting California's surface and groundwater resources.
The State Water Resources Control Board, the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board, the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board and the
Department of Fish and Wildlife have seen a dramatic increase in the number of
cannabis gardens, and corresponding increases in Impacts to water supply and
water quality, including the discharge of sediments, pesticides, fertilizers, petroleum
hydrocarbons, trash and human waste. The sources of these impacts result from
unpermitted and unregulated timber clearing, road development, stream diversion for
irrigation, land grading, erosion of disturbed surfaces and stream banks, and
temporary human occupancy without proper sanitary facilities. Express prohibition of
outdoor cannabis cultivation is necessary to reduce the risks of these impacts.

HH. Il The unregulated indoor cultivation of substantial amounts of cannabis poses
potential health and safety risks to those living in the residence, especially to
children, and includes the increased risks of fire from grow light systems, exposure to
fertilizers, pesticides, anti-fungus/mold agents, and exposure to potential property
crimes targeting the residence.

Il. The Federal Drug Enforcement Administration reports that various types of cannabis
plants under certain planting conditions may yield an average of between ½ pound to nearly 2 pounds of cannabis. The Northern California Regional Intelligence Center estimates the "street value" of domestically produced high-grade cannabis sold illegally in California at $200-$2500 per pound, and an informal survey by the Sheriff's Department of cannabis dispensary prices in Northern California revealed retail prices ranging between roughly $2000 per pound to roughly $6000 per pound.

JJ. Large-scale unregulated cannabis cultivation has attracted crime and associated
violence in this and other counties, and grows may involve armed guards and/or
booby traps that threaten severe bodily harm or death to anyone who attempts to
access the area of the grow. In 2011, there was an armed robbery and murder
associated with an illegal grow in Amador County, and a robbery aftempt in this
County resulted in the shooting deaths of three men in late 2015.
KK. Calaveras County has a compelling interest in protecting the public health, safety, and welfare of its residents and businesses, in protecting the local environment and local resources, in preserving the peace and quiet of the neighborhoods in which large-scale cannabis cultivation operations may exist, and in providing access to
cannabis for ill residents.

LL. The immunities from certain prosecution provided to qualified patients, their primary
caregivers, and medical and recreational users under State law to cultivate cannabis
plants does not confer the right to create or maintain a public nuisance. By adopting the regulations contained in this Chapter, the County is hoping to minimize the risks
of and complaints regarding fire, odor, crime, environmental degradation, and

pollution caused or threatened by the unregulated cultivation of cannabis in the
unincorporated area of Calaveras County.

MM. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to allow the cultivation, distribution, or
consumption of cannabis that is otherwise illegal under State law; to allow the diversion
of medical cannabis into the non-medical market; or to allow the diversion of any cannabis into interstate commerce. No provision of this Chapter shall be deemed a
defense or immunity to any action brought against any person by the County of Calaveras, Calaveras County District Attorney, the Attorney General of the State of
California, or the United States of America.

NN. In Browne v. County of Tehama, 213 Cal. App. 4th 704 (2013), the California
Court of Appeal stated that "Neither the Compassionate Use Act nor the Medical
Cannabis Program grants….anyone….an unfettered right to cultivate cannabis for
medical purposes. Accordingly, the regulation of cultivation of medical cannabis does
not conflict with either statute." Similarly, in City of Riverside v,. Inland Empire Patients Health & Wellness Center, Inc., 56 Cal. 4th 729 (2013), the California Supreme Court concurred that "Nothing in the CUA or the MMPA expressly or impliedly limits the inherent authority of a local jurisdiction, by its own ordinances, to regulate the use of its land..." Additionally, in Maral v. City of Live Oak (2013), 221 Cal.App. 4th 975, 983 (review denied), the same Court of Appeal held that "there is no right-and certainly no constitutional right-to cultivate medical cannabis...'" The Court in Live Oak affirmed the ability of a local governmental entity to prohibit the cultivation of cannabis under its land use authority. These cases have not been
overruled by the state's adoption of its new regulatory scheme.

OO. California Business and Professions Code §26200 expressly states that the division
added to the Business and Professions Code pursuant to MAUCRSA "shall not be
interpreted to supersede or limit the authority of a local jurisdiction to...completely prohibit the establishment or operation" of a commercial businesses licensed
under MAUCRSA or to "supersede or limit existing local authority for law enforcement activity, enforcement of local zoning requirements or local ordinances, or enforcement of local license, permit, or other authorization requirements".
PP. California Business and Professions® Code §26200 expressly states, "This division,
or any regulations promulgated there under, shall not be deemed to limit the authority
or remedies of a city, county, or city and county under any provision of law, including, but not limited to, Section 7 of Article XI of the California Constitution."

QQ. While California Health and Safety Code §11362.777 declares cannabis
cultivation an "agricultural product" for purposes of the Department of Food and
Agriculture's Medical Cannabis Cultivation Program and MCRSA, it also expressly prohibits cannabis cultivation statewide in the absence of "a license, permit, or other entitlement, specifically permitting cultivation pursuant to these provisions, from the city, county, or city and county in which the cultivation will occur". State law regulates cannabis differently than it does other agricultural products, and it
allows counties to do the same.

SECTION 4: CEQA FINDINGS
The Board of Supervisors of the County of Calaveras certifies that the Environmental Impact Report prepared for this ordinance has been completed in compliance with CEQA, that the Final Environmental Impact Report was presented to the Board of
Supervisors and the Board of Supervisors has reviewed and considered the information
contained in the Final EIR, and that the Final EIR reflects the County's independent judgment. Further, the Board of Supervisors hereby adopts the Findings of Fact, which are attached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated by reference.
SECTION 5: This ordinance, or a summary thereof including the vote of each Board member, shail be published within fifteen days after the date hereof in a newspaper of general circulation printed and published in the County of Calaveras, State of California, and shall become effective thirty days after the date hereof.
The foregoing ordinance was duly passed and adopted by the Board of Supervisors of the County of Calaveras at a regular meeting thereof, held on the 10th day of January, 2018, by the following vote:

ATTACHMENT A

CALAVERAS COUNTY BAN ON COMMERCIAL CANNABIS
OPERATIONS FINDINGS OF FACT

I. INTRODUCTION

The Calaveras County Board of Supervisors (Board), in the excrcise of its independent judgment, makes and adopts the following findings regarding the Calaveras County Ban on Commercial Cannabis Operations (the Ban Ordinance) in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.) (CEQA) and the CEQA Guidelines (Cal. Code Regs., Tit. 14, § 15000 et seq.).
IT. STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS FOR FINDINGS
Public Resources Code section 21002 provides that "public agencies should not approve projects as proposed if there are feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures available which would substantially lessen the significant environmental effects of such projects[ ]J" The same section provides that the procedures required by CEQA "are intended to assist public agencies in systematically identifying both the significant effects of projects and the feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures which will avoid or substantially lessen such significant effects." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21002.) Section 21002 goes on to provide that "in the event [that] specific economic, social, or other conditions make infeasible such project alternatives or such mitigation measures, individual projects may be approved in spite of one of more significant effects thereof."
The mandate and principles announced in Public Resources Code section 21002 are
inplemented, in part, through the requirement that agencies must adopt findings before approving projects for which EIRs are required. (See Pub. Resources Code, §21081, subd. (a);

CEQA Guidelines, §15091, subd. (a).) For each significant environmental effect identified in an EIR for a project, the approving agency must issue a written finding reaching one or more of three permissible conclusions:

(1) Changes or alterations have been required in, or incorporated into, the project which
avoid or substantially lessen the significant environmental effect as identified in the
final EIR.

(2) Such changes or alterations are within the responsibility and jurisdiction of another public agency and not the agency making the finding. Such changes have been adopted by such other agency or can and should be adopted by such other agency.

(3) Specific economic, legal, social, technological, or other considerations, including
provision of employment opportunities for highly trained workers, make infeasible
the mitigation measures or project alternatives identified in the final DIR.
(CEQA Guidelines, § 15091, subd. (a); Pub. Resources Code, § 21081, subd. (a).) Public Resources Code section 2106l.1 defines "feasible" to mean "capable of being accomplished in a successful manner within reasonable period of time, taking into account economic,
environmental, social, legal, and technological factors." (See also Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 565.)
With respect to a project for which significant impacts are not avoided or substantially lessened, a public agency, after adopting proper findings, may nevertheless approve the project if the agency first adopts a Statement of Overriding Considerations setting forth the specific reasons why the agency found that the project's "benefits" rendered "acceptable" its "unavoidable adverse environmental effects.* (CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15093, 15043, subd. (b); see also Pub.
Resources Code, §21081, subd. (b).)
Herc, as explained below and in the Final EIR, the Ban Ordinance would not result in any
significant environmental effects. Since there are no significant environmental effects, the Board is not required to consider any mitigation measures or alternatives, and CEQA does not require the Board to make any specific findings. Nevertheless, the Board issues these findings to document its independent judgment regarding the potential environmental effects analyzed in the Final BIR and to document its reasoning for approving the Ban Ordnance.

III. PROJECT BACKGROUND
Unregulated cannabis cultivation and related activities have been occurring in Calaveras County for decades. Even prior to the state's adoption of the Medical Marijuana Regulatory and Safety Act (MMRSA) in September, 2015, the Board and County staff were working to develop an ordinance to regulate the cultivation of medical cannabis, but, for a time, were
unable to establish clear policy guidance.
In carly 2016, the Board directed County staff to prepare an ordinance that would regulate
medical cannabis in the County. A draft regulatory ordinance was prepared and reviewed by the Board in February, 2016, and the County determined that an EIR would be necessary under

CEQA. The originally-proposed regulatory ordinance included measures that would establish land use regulations for the cultivation, manufacture, testing, distribution, and storage of medical marijuana within the County. A Notice of Preparation (NOP), the first step in preparing the EIR, was published by staff on April 5, 2016.
On May 10, 2016, the Board adopted an urgency ordinance---the Urgency Ordinance Regulating Medical Cannabis Cultivation and Commercial Uses Involving Medical Cannabis.
The purpose of the urgency ordinance was to quickly establish land use regulations concerning the cultivation, manufacture, testing, distribution, transportation, and storage of medical marijuana in the County. Adoption of the urgency ordinance was considered necessary to address conditions that were creating public nuisances related to location, types, and size of marijuana cultivation sites and commercial activities. Specifically, the urgency ordinance
addressed the proximity of marijuana plants and products near schools, degradation of the
natural environment, malodorous
smells, and indoor electrical fire hazards. Without further action by the Board, the urgency ordinance would have expired in by its terms in February 2018.
In November 2016, California voters passed Proposition 64, the Adult Use of Marijuana Act
(AUMA), an initiative that legalized recreational use of cannabis and limited the exlent to which
local jurisdictions could restrict cultivation for personal use. This complicated the County's regulatory scheme since the urgency ordinance only dealt with medical cannabis, not
recreational cannabis.

In the meantime, in observation that cannabis cultivation was continuing to proliferate in the
state, the County continued to consider its options for regulating cannabis. After new members
were elected to the Board in November, 2016, the Board directed staff to prepare an ordinance
that would ban cannabis cultivation and associated commercial activities in the County. A draft of the Ban Ordinance was prepared and posted on the Planning Department's website on April 27, 2017. The Ban Ordinance was also included in the Draft EIR and analyzed as an alternative to the originally-proposed regulatory ordinance. Because the Ban Ordinance will preclude legal cannabis-related development and its associated physical environmental impacts, it was considered a reasonable alternative to reduce the potential physical environmental impacts associated with implementation of the originally-proposed ordinance. The Draft EIR explained that it was intended to serve as the environmental clearance document necessary for the
Board's approval of either the originally-proposed regulatory ordinance or the Ban Ordinance.
The state legislature subsequently approved Senate Bill 94, known as the Medical and Adult
Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (MAUCRSA) which implemented Prop. 64 and significantly modified MCRSA with respect to both commercial cannabis regulation in general and to the addition of recreational use. This was signed into law by the Governor on June 27, 2017, and the Ban Ordinance was modified to conform to the new requirements.
Numerous other jurisdictions in California have considered or are considering similar bans
on cannabis-related operations to the extent allowable under state law.
IV. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION

A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES

Recognizing the requirements of state and federal law related to the use and distribution of cannabis, the primary objectives of the Ban Ordinance include the following:
1. Comprehensively regulate premises within the County used for marijuana cultivation or commercial activities related to marijuana or to prohibit those uses within the constraints of state law.

2. Maintain the health, safety, and well-being of the County, its residents, and environment.
3. Minimize risks of and complaints regarding fire, odor, and pollution caused by unregulated cultivation of marijuana within the County.
4. Protect the County's surface and groundwater resources by reducing the discharge
of sediments, pesticides, fertilizers, petroleum hydrocarbons, trash, and human
waste.

B. PROJECT LOCATION
Calaveras County is located in California's central Sierra Nevada region, ranging from low- elevation oak-covered foothills to high-elevation pine forests. The Mokelumne, Stanislaus and Calaveras rivers flow through the County collecting water from rain and melting snow to fill the County's numerous lakes and reservoirs. The majority of land within the County falls within the regulatory jurisdiction of the County, with the exception of the City of Angels Camp, the only incorporated city within the county boundaries, and federal and state lands
(approximate 13 percent of the land area of the County). Approximately 39,000 acres within the County are owned by the Bureau of Land Management with an additional 6,000 acres, associated with the Calaveras Big Trees State Park, owned by the State of California. The Ban Ordinance will apply countywide.
C. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Ban Ordinance is an amendment to Chapter 17.95 of the Calaveras County Code that, once in effect, will ban the cultivation of, and other commercial activities related to, cannabis
within the County to the extent allowable under state law. The Ordinance contains six
sections: a purpose and intent statement, definitions, provisions describing the relationship to other laws, a declaration that cultivation and all commercial activities relating to cannabis
(except dispensaries and the minimum non-commercial cultivation protected under state law)
are a nuisance and therefore prohibited, provisions for remediation of cultivation sites, and
enforcement provisions.
With the adoption of the Ban Ordinance, the County will implement a ban on commercial cannabis operations and cannabis cultivation, in general, except for up to six indoor cannabis plants (regardless of whether they are cultivated for medical or recreational use or both). Per Proposition 64, as approved on November 8, 2016 by California voters (California Health and
Safety Code section 11362.2, subdivision (b)(2)), the County may not completely prohibit residents from growing marijuana indoors and must allow residents the ability to cultivate up to six indoor plants (although reasonable regulations can be imposed).

Under the Ban Ordinance, no new commercial cannabis cultivation, processing, or distribution facilities will be allowed within the County. The Ban Ordinance will also require the cessation of commercial cannabis operations currently allowed under the County's urgency ordinance and will require the restoration of existing sites. Steps must be taken to prevent crosion and
run-off, properly dispose of or store agricultural chemicals, fuels, and other substances that could be considered hazardous, and remove any temporary or unauthorized structures. The responsibility, including all expenditures, for restoration, will be borne by the individual
property owners.

V. ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS
In accordance with Public Resources Code section 21092 and CEQA Guidelines section 15082, the County issued a notice of preparation (NOP) on April 7, 2016, to inform agencies and the general public that an EIR was being prepared and to invite comments on the scope and content of the document. The NOP was submitted to the State Clearinghouse; posted on the County's website (http://planning.calaverasgov.us); posted with the Calaveras County Clerk; and made available at the Calaveras County Planning Department as well as the San Andreas Central Library. In addition, the NOP was distributed directly to public agencies (including potential responsible and trustee agencies), intercsted parties, and individuals who had previously requested such notices. Finally, e press release was issued by the County on April 5, 2016. The NOP was circulated through May 6, 2016, for a 30-day review period.
In accordance with Public Recourses Code section 21083.9 and CEQA Guidelines section 15082(c), a noticed scoping meeting for the EIR occurred on July 20, 2016, at the Calaveras County Board of Supervisors Chambers in San Andreas, California.
On May 1, 2017, a Draft EIR was released for a 45-day public review and comment period that ended on June 14, 2017.
The Draft EIR identified the Medical Cannabis Cultivation and Commerce Ordinance
(regulatory ordinance) as the "proposed project." At the direction of the Board, the Ban Ordinance was included in the Draft EIR and analyzed as an alternative to the proposed project. The Draft EIR explained that the Board directed County Counsel and the County Planning Department to prepare an ordinance banning the cultivation and other commercial activities related to cannabis to the extent allowable under state law and that the Draft EIR
could serve as the appropriate CEQA document for adoption of the Ban Ordinance. The Draft EIR analyzed the polential environmental impacts of both the initially proposed regulatory ordinance and the Ban Ordnance, as well as two other alternatives. The level of impact varied by alternative, with only the Ban Ordnance having no impacts or less than significant impacts. Accordingly, the Ban Ordinance was identified as the "environmentally superior
alternative."

The DEIR was submitted to the State Clearinghouse; posted on the County's website
(http://planning.calaverasgov.us); posted with the Calaveras County Clerk; and made available al the Calaveras County Planning Department as well as the San Andreas Central Library. A notice of availability was distributed by the County to the Calaveras Enterprise and a project- specific mailing list.

The County held a public hearing on May 22, 2017, to receive input from agencies and the public on the Draft EIR. The hearing was held at the Calaveras County Board of Supervisors Chambers in San Andreas, California.
The County issued a Final EIR on September 5, 2017. The Final EIR includes the written and verbal comments that the County received from agencies, organizations, and individuals on the
content of the Draft EIR, and responses to those comments. The Final EIR also includes minor revisions and clarifications, including an additional alternative and mitigation measure that were proposed during the comment period.
The Calaveras County Planning Commission held a public hearing on September 28, 2017, to consider a recommendation to the Board of Supervisors. The Planning Commission voted to recommend that the Board consider both the Ban Ordinance and a strict regulatory ordinance that would impose greater restrictions on cannabis cultivation than allowed under the
originally- proposed regulatory ordinance.

VI. RECIRCULATION

Under CEQA Guidelines section 15088.5, recirculation of an EIR is required when "significant new information" is added to the EIR after public notice is given of the availability of the Draft EIR for public review but prior to certification of the Final EIR. The term "information" can
include changes in the project or environmental setting, as well as additional data ol other information. New information added to an EIR is not "significant," however, unless the EIR is changed in a way that deprives the public of a meaningful opportunity to comment upon a substantial adverse environmental effect of the project or a feasible way to mitigate or avoid such an effect (including a feasible project alternative) that the project's proponents have declined to implement. "Significant new information" requiring recirculation includes, for example, a disclosure showing that:
(1) A new significant environmental impact would result from the project or from a
new mitigation measure proposed to be implemented.

(2) A substantial increase in the severity of an environmental impact would result
unless mitigation measures are adopted that reduce the impact to a level of
insignificance.

(3) A feasible project alternative or mitigation measure considerably different from others previously analyzed would clearly lessen the significant environmental
impacts of the project, but the project's proponents decline to adopt it.

(4) The DEIR was so fundamentally and basically inadequate and conclusory in nature that meaningful public review and comment were precluded.
(CEQA Guidelines, § 15088.5, subd. (a).)
Recirculation is not required where the new information added to the EIR merely clarifies or amplifics or makes insignificant modifications in an adequate EIR. The above standard is "not intend[ed] to promote endless rounds of revision and recirculation of EIRs." (Laurel Heights

Improvement Assn. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 1112, 1132.) "Recirculation was intended to be an exception, rather than the general rule." (lbid.)
The Final EIR includes minor changes and revisions to the Draft EIR, including the addition of a new alternative-Alternative 4-that was suggested during the public comment period. That alternative, however, is not considerably different from the others previously analyzed and would not clearly lessen the significant environmental impacts of either the originally- proposed regulatory ordinance or the Ban Ordinance. Alternative 4 is similar to Alternative 3, with minor differences mainly related to setbacks and restricting such activities to larger parcels. Alternative
4 would result in similar environmental impacts as Alternative 3, which was analyzed in the DEIR. Moreover, Alternative 4 would result in greater impacts than the Ban Ordnance approved by the Board, which was also analyzed in the Draft EIR. Accordingly, including Alternative 4 in the Final EIR did not require recirculation. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15088.5, subd. (a)(3); see also South County Citizens for Smart Growth v. County of Nevada (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 316, 330- 331.)
The Board finds that nonc of the changes and revisions in the Final EIR substantially affects the analysis or conclusions presented in the Draft EIR. Therefore, recirculation of the Draft
EIR for additional public comments is not required. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15088.5, subd.
(a).)

VIII. FINDINGS FOR IMPACTS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN SIGNIFICANT OR NO IMPACT WITHOUT IMPLEMENTATION OF MITIGATION MEASURES
The Board has reviewed and considered the information in the Draft EIR and the Final EIR, addressing potential environmental effects, as well as the proposed mitigation measures, and alternatives.
As explained in the Draft EIR and Final EIR, the analysis of the Ban Ordinance assumes full compliance with the terms of the Ordinance. As explained in the Final EIR, it is generally appropriate under CEQA to presume that a project will be implemented as proposed, that applicable regulations will be followed, and that applicants will operate their project legally. During the public comment period, however, some commenters claimed that the EIR should
have assumed instead that people would not comply with the ordinance and that the EIR should have analyzed and quantified the environmental impacts that could potentially occur as a result of non-compliant, illegal cannabis operations that might occur in spite of the ban.
That type of speculation, however, is not required under CEQA, and in fact, would be impossible. As acknowledged in the EIR, illegal cannabis activities are already occurring under existing "baseline" conditions and even if such activities were to continue after the Ban
Ordinance is implemented, those activities would not result in additional environmental impacts over baseline conditions. Moreover, the degree to which illegal activities might increase under the Ban Ordinance is entirely speculative since such activities would be expressly prohibited under the ordinance and any person who violates the ordinance is subject to penalties.
Nevertheless, the BIR's discussion of the Ban Ordinance acknowledges that illegal activities may persist to some degree in spite of the ban and generally discusses potential impacts related to that type of activity. It would have been too speculative, however, to assign significance determinations for those types of impacts (e.g., impacts that may result from illegal activities
and non-compliance with the Ban Ordinance). Accordingly, the Board finds that the analysis of

the Ban Ordinance in the EIR is reasonable and includes sufficient information to allow the Board to make a fully informed decision. Further, the Board finds that there are no feasible mitigation measures available that would reduce the potential environmental impacts caused by illegal cannabis activities if such activities were to occur in spite of the ban.
The Board, relying on the facts and analysis in the Draft EIR and Final EIR, which were presented to the Board and reviewed and considered prior to any approvals, concurs with the conclusions of the Draft EIR and Final EIR regarding the potential environmental effects of the Ban Ordinance.
The Board concurs with the conclusions in the Final EIR that the Ban Ordinance has no
potential for significant environmental effects on the following resource categories: Agriculture and Forestry Resources; Geology and Soils; Hazards and Hazardous Materials; Mineral Resources; Public Services; Recreation; and Utilitics and Service Systems.
The Board also concurs with the conclusions in the Final EIR that all of the following impacts will be less than significant or no impact:
Aesthetics
Impact 3.1-1: Have a substantial adverse effect on a scenic vista or substantially damage scenic resources.

Impact 3.1-2: Substantially degrade the existing visual character or quality of the project
area.

Impact 3.1-3: Create a new source of substantial light or glare that would adversely affect views.

Air Quality

IX. PROJECT ALTERNATIVES
CEQA Guidelines section 15126.6 states that an EIR "shall describe a range of reasonable alternatives to the project, or to the location of the project, which would feasibly attain most of the basic objectives of the project but would avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant
effects of the project, and evaluate the comparative merits of the alternatives. An EIR need not consider every conceivable alternative to project."
The Final EIR analyzed the originally-proposed regulatory ordinance plus four alternatives. In addition to the Ban Ordinance (which was identified as Alternative 2), the Final EIR
analyzed the following three alternatives:

Alternative 1 - No Project, which assumes no change in the County Code and continuation of the existing zoning ordinance. This alternative also assumes that the urgency ordinance would not be extended into the future;
Alternative 3 - Reduced Zoning Designations Available for Commercial Cannabis Operations, which assumes reduction in the zoning designations that would allow commercial cannabis operations. Under this alternative, Rural Residential (RR) would be removed from consideration as an acceptable zone within which commercial cannabis operations could occur.
Alternative 4 - Minimum Parcel Sizes and Further Reduced Zoning Designations Available for Commercial Cannabis Operations, which included a further restriction on the zoning designations available for commercial cannabis cultivation and related activities and would also
establish minimum parcel sizes for many of the allowable zones.
The Board finds that the alternatives analyzed in the EIR represent a "reasonable range" of alternatives and that the EIR included sufficient analysis to allow for informed decision making. (See San Joaquin Raptor/Wildlife Rescue Center v. County of Stanislaus (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 713, 735 ["discussion of alternatives must be 'meaningful' and must 'contain analysis sufficient to allow informed decision making].) It bears mentioning, moreover, that the fact that the Ban Ordinance was analyzed as an alternative in the EIR rather than the "proposed project" is not an infirmity under CEQA. CEQA does not constrain agencies to only adopt a project as originally proposed in a Draft EIR, but instead provides agencies with flexibility to adopt any alternative, or even just a portion of an alternative, to satisfy their environmental concerns. (Sierra Club v. City of Orange (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 523, 533; Dusek v. Redevelopment Agency (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 1029, 1041; CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15002, subd. (a), (h), 15021, subd. (a); see Sequoyah Hills Homeowners Assn. v. City of Oakland (1993) 23 Cal.App.4th 704, 713 [upholding agencies approval of an alternative rather than the proposed project].) In fact, CEQA specifically directs agencies to choose an alternative that lessens the significant environmental impacts of a project, whenever feasible. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21002, 21081; CEQA Guidelines, § 15002, subd. (h).)
Because the Board has determined that the potential impacts of the Ban Ordinance are less than significant, the Board is not required to consider the feasibility of any project alternatives. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21002; Laurel Hills Homeowners Association v. Cily Council (1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 515, 521 (Laurel Hills); see also Kings County Farm Bureau v. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 730-731; and Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. V. Regents of the University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 400-403.)
The Board notes, however, that the environmental superiority of the Ban Ordinance is alone a sufficient reason to adopt the Ban Ordinance rather than the other alternatives analyzed in the EIR. As explained previously, the purpose of an EIR is to identify ways to avoid or mitigate the significant environmental impacts of a proposed project. Here, the Final EIR analyzed the originally-proposed regulatory ordinance, the Ban Ordinance, as well as three other
alternatives. The originally-proposed regulatory ordinance would result in numerous environmental impacts and, while most of those impacts could be reduced to a less-than- significant level with mitigation, the regulatory ordinance would result in traffic and odor impacts that would remain significant and unavoidablc even with the mitigation measures identified in the EIR. While the other alternatives would reduce those impacts to some degree,

the Ban Ordinance is the only alternative that would not result in any significant impacts and would not require mitigation.
