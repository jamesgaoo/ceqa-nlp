11679991.6 a01/12/18 AND COMPLAINT

1 INTRODUCTORY ALLEGATIONS

2 1. This Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint ("Petition") is brought by
3 Petitioner/Plaintiff City of Irvine ("City") pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085,
4 1094.5, 1060 and 526 et seq., as well as Public Resources Code sections 21167, 21168 and 21168.5,
5 to challenge the County of Orange ("County") and Orange County Board of Supervisors' ("Board")
6 (collectively, "Respondents") approval of a massive, high impact mixed used project allowing
7 development of 1,000,000 square feet of office uses, 1,998 residential dwelling units, 200,000
8 square feet of retail, and 242 hotel rooms (the "Project") on approximately 108 acres in the City of
9 Irvine ("City") (the "Site) that was formerly part of the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station (the
10 "Base"). Respondents' approval of the Project ignored the fact that the Site has long been planned
11 for only several hundred thousand square of low impact, public intuitional/governmental uses, as
12 reflected in the applicable City and County General Plan and zoning designations, as well as the
13 parties' Property Tax Transfer and Pre-Annexation Agreement ("Property Tax Exchange
14 Agreement") and City's Amended and Restated Development Agreement ("ARDA"), which
15 governs the redevelopment of the former Base as the Orange County Great Park ("OCGP").

16 2. As described in more detail herein, Respondents' approval of the Project violated the
17 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA," codified as Public Resources Code §§ 21000 et
18 seq.); the State CEQA Guidelines ("CEQA Guidelines," promulgated as title 14 of the California
19 Code of Regulations, §§ 15000 et seq.); the City's General Plan, the County's General Plan,
20 including a ballot measure amending the same (*Measure W"), City and County Code; and the
21 Property Tax Exchange Agreement entered into by the City and County (as well as the City's now
22 defunct Redevelopment Agency) concerning future use the Site.

23 3. This Petition seeks a Court Order mandating that Respondents rescind the
24 November 14, 2017 approval of Resolution 17-138 (the "Resolution"), which (a) certified Final
25 Program EIR No. 620 for the El Toro 100-Acre Development Plan ("FPEIR"); (b) adopted a
26 Statement of Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations for the FPEIR; (c) adopted
27 a Mitigation and Monitoring and Reporting Program ("MMRP") for the FPEIR; (d) approved the EI
28 Toro 100-Acre Development Plan ("Development Plan"), as modified by the Reduced Density

11679991.6 a01/12/18 AND COMPLAINT

F Alternative set forth in Alternative 3 in the FPEIR; and (e) authorized execution of a Master Ground
2 Lease with Lowe Enterprises Real Estate Group ("Lowe") in substantially the same form as was

3 attached to the Resolution (the "Master Ground Lease").

4. This Petition further seeks a Court Order (a) mandating that Respondents rescind
5 approval of the Resolution because it is inconsistent with both the City and/or County General Plan,
6 and (b) enjoining Respondents from approving any other project on the Site or any other property
7 that was formerly part of the Base and is now under County control that allows uses that are
8 inconsistent with either the City or County General Plans.

9 5. This Petition further seeks a Court Order (a) declaring that Respondents, by
10 approving the Resolution, have breached the Property Tax Exchange Agreement because the
11 Property Tax Exchange Agreement does not allow Respondents to approve the uses allowed by the
12| Project on the Site, and (b) enjoining Respondents from approving any other project on the Site or
13 any other property that was formerly part of the Base and is now under County control that allows
14 uses not contemplated by the Property Tax Exchange Agreement.

15 6. While the Respondents' approval of the Project was unlawful (and the FPEIR is
16 inadequate under CEQA) for many reasons, many of the Project and the FPEIR's defects are the
17 result around the County's erroneous position that the Project is not subject to any land use authority,
18 and in particular, its steadfast refusal to acknowledge that the City has any authority over the
19 massive, for-profit private project proposed within its jurisdiction, which has no basis in fact or law.

20 THE PARTIES

21 7. Petitioner and Plaintiff City is, and at all times mentioned herein was, a municipal
22 corporation and charter city, duly organized and existing under the Constitution and laws of the
23 State of California and the City's Charter, and is governed by its duly elected City Council. The
24 City has been, for many years, designated as "the safest city in America" for cities with a population
25 over 100,000 residents. The City has been closely monitoring the processing of the Project to ensure
26 that, among other issues, public safety issues and other matters of governmental and public interest
27 are fully addressed in the FPEIR. The City has the authority and duty to protect the public health,
28 safety and general welfare of its citizens, residents, employees and visitors within its boundaries,

attorneys at law 2523/048170-1005 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
11679991.6 a01/12/18 AND COMPLAINT

1 including those who travel through or are otherwise directly or indirectly affected by the operation

2 and use of the Project. By virtue of its police powers, duties and responsibilities, the City is
3 beneficially interested in the Project and the outcome of this proceeding. Unlike virtually any other
4 development project proposed within the City's jurisdiction, the City was not the lead agency under
5 CEQA for the Project, and the County has steadfastly refused to allow the City land use (or any)
6 approval authority over the Project, over the City's objections. The Project would result in a massive
7 mixed use development within the jurisdiction of City yet not controlled by the City, nor would it
8 comply with City Code, standards or design guidelines. As a result, the Project will result in
9 significant impacts on the City and its residents.

10 8. Further, issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer significant
11 benefits on the general public by requiring the County to carry out their duties under CEQA and
12 other applicable laws prior to proceeding with the Project. Issuance of the relief requested will also
13 result in the enforcement of important rights affecting the public interest by compelling the County
14 to engage in a fair, objective, and legally adequate analysis of the Project, and ensure that the public
15 has a meaningful opportunity to review and comment on the impacts and mitigation measures for
16 the Project.

17 9. The City a also brings this action as a private attorney general pursuant to Code of
18 Civil Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory to enforce important rights
19 affecting the public interest. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement are such as to make
20 an award of attorneys' fees appropriate in this case. Absent enforcement by the City, the County
21 will proceed with a project that will cause significant, unmitigated environmental impacts that might
22 otherwise have been reduced or avoided through legally adequate environmental review and the
23 adoption of feasible mitigation measures.

24 10. Respondent and Defendant County is a political and geographical subdivision of the
25 State of California with its principal offices located in the City of Santa Ana, California, with the
26 legal ability to be sued. (See, Government Code § 23001 et. seq.). The County acted as lead agency
27 for environmental review of the Project and certified the FPEIR in that capacity, as indicated in the
28 Project's November 14, 2017 Notice of Determination ("NOD"). The County has a mandatory duty

attorneys at faw 2523/048170-1005 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
11679991.6 a01/12/18 AND COMPLAINT

1 to comply with applicable local planning documents (e.g., the City and County General Plans), local

2 ordinances, and state law requirements, including CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, when
3 considering discretionary activities and land use regulatory actions, such as the Project. The County

4 also has a mandatory duty to comply with the Property Tax Exchange Agreement.

5 11. Respondent and Defendant Orange County Board of Supervisors ("Board") is the
6 legislative body of the County, which voted to approve the Project and certify the FPEIR by
7 approving the Resolution.

8 12. The City is informed and believes and alleges thereon that Real Party in Interest
9 Lowe is a California corporation. Pursuant to the Master Ground Lease and Development Plan
10 approved by the County on November 14, 2017, Lowe will develop the Project. In substance, the
11 City is informed and believes, and alleges thereon, that Lowe is the proponent - or at a minimum,
12 along with the County, a proponent - of the Project. Lowe will control the Site under the Master
13 Ground Lease, which has a 99 year term.

14 13. The City is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Respondents and Defendants
15 sued herein as Does 1 through 50 and therefore sues those Respondents and Defendants by such
16 fictitious names. The City is informed and believes and alleges thereon that each of the fictitiously-
17 named Respondents and Defendants is in some manner responsible or liable for the events and
18 happenings referred to herein, and that each such fictitiously named Respondent and Defendant
19 caused injury and damage to City as alleged in this Petition. The City will seek leave of Court to
20 amend this Petition to allege the true names and capacities of such fictitiously-named Respondents
21 and Defendants when the same are ascertained.

22 14. The City is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Real Parties in Interest sued
23 herein as Roes 51 through 60 and therefore sues those Real Parties in Interest by such fictitious
24 names. The City is informed and believes and alleges thereon that each of the fictitiously-named
25 Real Parties in Interest is in some manner responsible or liable for the events and happenings referred
26 to herein, and that each such fictitiously named Real Parties in Interest caused injury and damage to
27 City as alleged in this Petition. The City will seek leave of Court to amend this Petition to allege

1 the true names and capacities of such fictitiously-named Real Parties in Interest when the same are

2 ascertained.

3 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

4 15. The City has performed all conditions precedent to filing a CEQA action against
5 Respondents and has exhausted all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.
6| The City objected to the approval of the Project and certification of the FPEIR during the
7 administrative process, including but not limited to its two comment letters (dated
8 December 16, 2016 and November 13, 2017) setting forth, inter alia, the many deficiencies in both
9 the draft and final versions of the EIR, and Respondents' violation of the Property Tax Exchange
10 Agreement.

11 16. Notice of the City's intent to file this Petition was served by personal service and
12 overnight mail on Respondents on December 13, 2017, to the attention of Hugh Ngyuen, the County
13 Clerk-Recorder (a true and correct copy of the proof of service of this notice is attached hereto as
14 Exhibit A and incorporated herein by this reference), pursuant to Public Resources Code

15 section 21167.5.

16 17. A copy of this pleading shall be furnished to the Attorney General of the State of
17 California in accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167.7.

18 18. The City elects to prepare the administrative record, and that election is filed and
19 served with this Petition.

20 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

21 19. This Court has jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to California Code of Civil
22 Procedure sections 1085, 1094.5, 1060, 526 et seq., and CEQA, including but not limited to Public
23 Resource Code sections 21167, 21168 and 21168.5. Venue in this Court is proper pursuant to Code
24 of Civil Procedure section 394, because both the County and the City are located within the County

25 of Orange.

26 20. On November 14, 2017, or soon thereafter, the County filed for posting an NOD for
27 the Project. This Petition was filed on or before December 14, 2017, within the applicable statute

28 of limitations.

1 21. The subject matter of this Complaint relates to Respondents' November 14, 2017,
2 approval of Resolution 17-138, which relates to real property within the boundaries of the City of
3 Irvine. Code of Civil Procedure section 860 et seq. authorizes a local agency or private party to
4 bring an action in the Superior Court of the County in which the principal office of the local agency

5 is located to determine the validity of a matter that under any other law authorizes to be determined
6 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 860 et seq. Code of Civil Procedure section 860 et seq.
7 establishes that this case is, among other things, a proceeding in rem. Under these facts, jurisdiction

8 and venue are proper in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Orange.
9 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

10 Annexation of the Base from the County into the City

11 22. In July 1992, the United States Department of Navy ("DoN") decide to close the
12 Base under the Base Realignment and Closure Act. At that time, the Base was located in an
13 unincorporated area of the County.

14 23. At the March 5, 2002 election, the voters of the County adopted Measure W, and in
15 so doing, decided that the Base would be redeveloped as what is now known as the OCGP. In
16 particular, Measure W "amends the Orange County General Plan to authorize the closed [Base] to
17 be used for non-aviation uses, including multi-purpose central park, open space, nature preserve,
18 universities and schools, cultural facility, and other interim and long-term uses described herein."
19 (Measure W, § A.)

20 24. Dating back to November 25, 1997, the City determined that it would pursue the
21 annexation of the Base into the City. Before annexation could be accomplished, the following five
22 steps, among others, had to be completed: (1) prezoning of the property; (2) formulation of a
23 Municipal Services Plan; (3) preparation of a Fiscal Impact Report; (4) preparation of environmental
24 documentation; and (5) entry into a Property Tax Exchange Agreement with the County. Although
25 the City had substantial control over the first four steps in the process, execution of a Property Tax
26 Exchange Agreement required the cooperation, and ultimately consent, of the County.

27 25. Property tax exchange agreements are generally governed by Revenue & Taxation
28 Code ("R&T Code") §§ 99 and 99.02. Property tax exchange agreements, whether formulated

Rutan & Tucker, LLP -7-
attorneys at law 2523/048170-1005 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
11679991.6 a01/12/18 AND COMPLAINT

- pursuant to R&T Code § 99 or R&T Code § 99.02, constitute a modification a and reallocation of
2 property tax revenues from the basic property tax allocation scheme, generally known as "AB8", as
3 specifically found in R&T Code §§ 96 and/or 96.1. (See R&T Code §§ 99(a)(1) and 99.02(a).)

4 26. Property tax exchange agreements which involve a "jurisdictional change" a subject
5 to the Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Local Government Reorganization Act of 2000 (Division 3)
(commencing with Section 56000) of Title 5 of the Government Code (the "Reorganization Act"),
7 such as the annexation of the Base to the City, are governed by R&T Code § 99(b). In general,

8 negotiations of property tax exchange agreements pursuant to R&T Code § 99(b) are limited in
9 scope to the "exchange of property tax revenues."

10 27. In addition to the general procedural and substantive requirements and limitations
11 imposed upon property tax exchange agreements subject to the Reorganization Act, R&T Code
12 § 99(e)(1) imposes further substantive and procedural requirements and limitations upon a

13 "jurisdictional change" that consists of the City's qualified annexation of an unincorporated
14 territory, such as the case at bar, which includes, among other things, retention of a third-party
15 consultant to perform a comprehensive, independent, fiscal analysis that specifies estimates of all
16 tax revenues that would be derived from the annexed territory and the cost of county services with
17 respect to the annexed territory, as well as mediation, and ultimately arbitration if an annexing city
18 and a county cannot reach agreement regarding the division of property tax revenues. (R&T Code
19 § 99(e)(1).) A local agency formation commission ("LAFCO") shall not impose any fiscal
a 20 conditions upon a city's qualified annexation of unincorporated territory other than the division of
21 property tax revenues as

22 99(e)(2).) determined in the process set forth in R&T Code § 99(e)(1). (R&T Code

23 28. Property tax exchange agreements formulated outside of the purview of the
24 Reorganization Act are generally governed by R&T Code § 99.02. As is the case with property tax
25 exchange agreements formulated pursuant to R&T Code § 99, property tax exchange agreements
26 formulated pursuant to R&T Code § 99.02 are limited to property tax transfers and exchanges. In
27 addition, property tax exchange agreements formulated pursuant to R&T Code § 99.02 require,
28 among other things, a noticed public hearing and the adoption of certain findings. (R&T Code

Rutan & Tucker, LLP

11679991.6 a01/I2/18 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT

1 § 99.02(e)-(f).) The City is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that neither City Council
2 nor the Board followed or complied with R&T Code § 99.02(e)-(f) in relation to any property tax
3 exchange agreement ultimately executed between those parties.

4 29. The County possessed no viable objections to annexation of the Base into the City.
5 However, and notwithstanding the specific limitations set forth upon property tax exchange
6 agreements in R&T Code §§ 99 and 99.02, the County demanded, and ultimately received, several
7 significant concessions and giveaways from the City beyond an appropriate division of property tax

8 revenues. In general, as explained in more detail below, the County required that it receive,
9 approximately 108 acres generally located south of Marine Way, generally north of the Railroad
10 tracks that run along the southern border of the EI Toro property, and generally east of O Street (i.e.,
11 the Project Site) and an approximately 44 acre parcel northwest of the intersection of Alton Parkway
12 and Irvine Boulevard in the City ("WAP Parcel"), where the County is currently processing (but has
13 not yet approved) a development plan similar to the Site's approved Development Plan that is
14 challenged here.

15 30. The City, the former Irvine Redevelopment Agency ("Irvine RDA"), and the County
16 ultimately entered into the Property Tax Exchange Agreement on or about March 4, 2003. Property
17 tax exchange agreements subject to the Reorganization Act, such as the one at bar, are incorporated
18 into the LAFCO approval process in that the LAFCO Executive Officer "shall not issue a certificate
19 of filing pursuant to Section 56658 of the Government Code until the local agencies included in the
20 property tax revenue exchange negotiation . . present resolutions adopted by each such county and
21 city whereby each county and city agrees to accept the exchange of property tax revenues." (R&T
22 Code § 99(b)(6).) The City is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that the Property Tax
23 Exchange Agreement was presented to the Orange County LAFCO Executive Director pursuant to
24 the requirements of R&T Code § 99(b)(6). The Property Tax Exchange Agreement was part and
25 parcel of the LAFCO process.

26 31. As previously discussed, property tax exchange agreements are statutorily limited to
27 the transfer and exchange of property tax revenues. Notwithstanding this fact, the County demanded
28 not only the transfer of the Site and the WAP Parcel to the County, but certain guarantees regarding

Rutan & Tucker, LLP -9-
attorneys at law 2523/048170-1005 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
11679991.6 a01/12/18 AND COMPLAINT

1 the land use characterization of the Site to be provided by present and future City Councils. Said
2 demand not only exceeded the authorization set forth in R&T Code §§ 99 and 99.02, but once
3 incorporated into the Orange County LAFCO process, further violated the direct prohibition that

4 LAFCO "shall not impose any conditions that would directly regulate land use density or intensity,
5 property development, or subdivision requirements." (Government Code § 56375(a)(6).) In

6 addition, the decision of a LAFCO with regard to a proposal to annex territory to a city, such as the
7 one at bar, "shall be based upon the general plan and prezoning of the city." (Government Code
8 § 56375(a)(7).) In attempting to leverage the LAFCO approval process to secure the exaction of
9 over 150 acres of land, without payment or compensation, along with certain land use and
10 development guarantees, the County, and ultimately the Property Tax Exchange Agreement, ran
11 afoul of the clear limitations and prohibitions set forth in both the Revenue & Taxation Code as well
12 as the Reorganization Act. For these reasons alone, certain provisions of the Property Tax Exchange
13 Agreement should be declared void and without enforceability.
14 32. In the Property Tax Exchange Agreement, the County sought not only the gratis
15 dedication of acres of approximately 152 acres valuable land, but also sought certain land use and
16 development guarantees applicable to both the then-current as well as future City Councils.
17 Although the Property Tax Exchange Agreement does not identify specific uses for the Site, it does
18 define that property as being "for the exclusive use of the County or its designees, lessees, or
19 concessionaires, including but not limited to joint venturers with private or public agencies to
20 construct and operate permitted uses and facilities." (Property Tax Exchange Agreement, § 2.2.3.1).
21 Consistent with that designation, Exhibit A to the Property Tax Exchange Agreement describes the
22 Site (and the WAP Parcel) as "public facilities." (Property Tax Exchange Agreement, Exhibit A,
23 Note 5). Section 2.2.4 of the Property Tax Exchange Agreement further provides:

24 "Irvine agrees that while the parcels of Base property the County is to receive will be annexed to Irvine, that notwithstanding said fact, Irvine will zone County's parcels
25 and designate them in Irvine's General Plan, in accordance with the County's

26 designation. In addition, County shall retain exclusive land use control over said parcels, and shall be entitled to place any development upon said parcels the County

27 shall determine to be desirable for County's needs, as though said property remained unincorporated, without the obligation for payment to Irvine for any permit fees or

28 other mitigation/impact fees, other than in Section 2.2.5, including but not limited to the following uses, all of which Irvine agrees with.' "The uses listed in Section 2.2.4 include animal shelters, environmental health facilities, automotive/equipment repair

11679991.6 a01/12/18 AND COMPLAINT

1 facilities, child care facilities, youth and family resource center, law enforcement

2 training facilities, emergency shelters, transitional shelter care facilities, children and family service centers, business offices, warehouses, storage facilities, vehicle

3 parking and storage facilities, heavy equipment maintenance and storage, operation and maintenance facilities." and field

33. If, and to the extent, sections 2.2.3 and 2.2.4 of the Property Tax Exchange

5 Agreement are ultimately determined to be complete and limitless delegations of City councilmanic

6 land use authority over the Site (and WAP) to the County, or its "designees, lessees, or
7 concessionaires. " (Property Tax Exchange Agreement, section 2.2.3.1), the Property Tax

8 Exchange Agreement, or at least those provisions thereof, would constitute an abdication of the

9 City's Police Power, a violation of numerous public hearing, public participation, and transparency
10 requirements and an unlawful delegation of police power constitutionally held by the City Council

11 to external public agencies or even private parties, and thus void and unenforceable.

12 34. Recognizing the potentially unlawful nature of an unbridled grant of police power
13 land use discretion to the County, or its public and private designees, as potentially voiding the gratis
14 extraction of the Site and potentially as well as other property dedicated to the County pursuant to
15 the Property Tax Exchange Agreement, such as the WAP Parcel, the County agreed that its use of
16 the property shall be subject to, at a minimum, County land use controls including the County
17 General Plan, so that the County's use of the Site would be "as though said property remained
18 unincorporated. ..*" (Property Tax Exchange Agreement, Section 2.2.4). This language, which limits
19 the County's "exclusive land use control over said parcels," subjects the County's use of the Site to,
20 at a minimum, County land use controls applied on a uniform and non-discriminatory matter, which
21 the County has also refused to recognize. One of those County land use controls, which would have
22 been applicable on March 4, 2003 and is currently applicable, is Measure W.

23 35. Measure a W, which was a voter initiative amending the County's General Plan for all
24 of the property located within the Base, limits the uses available on the Site to public facilities and
25 prohibits, without exception, the uses proposed by the Project, as set forth in more detail herein.
26 Any interpretation of Sections 2.2.3 and 2.2.4 of the Property Tax Exchange Agreement which
27 exempts the Development Plan from the City's General Plan, the County's General Plan (including
28 Measure W), the City's Zoning Code, and the County's Zoning Code clearly and unequivocally

2 participation, and transparency requirements, and a delegation a and abdication of the City's police
3 power land use authority and is unenforceable.

4 36. Assuming that Sections 2.2.3 - 2.2.4 do not constitute an unlawful delegation and

5 abdication of the City's police power land use authority over the Site, those provisions must be

6 interpreted in such a manner that the City retains meaningful land use authority over the Sitc.

7 3.7. Recognizing that Sections 2.2.3 - 2.2.4, at a minimum, might be unlawful and
8 unenforceable, the County attempted to include a "poison pill" through the inclusion of Section 5,
9 which reads, in relevant part:

10 "The parties agree that the provisions of this agreement are dependent upon each

11 other, and failure of any party to comply with any provision of this agreement shall render the entire agreement void. In particular, the provisions of this agreement relating to a property tax transfer under subparagraph 2.2.6 above shall be void and
12 shall be of no force and effect, unless the parties fully comply with other provisions

13 of this agreement."

14 In addition to an express recognition that the property tax transfer provisions of the Property
15 Tax Exchange Agreement, which are located in Section 2.2.6, are independent of the other
16 provisions of the Property Tax Exchange Agreement, this provision to the extent that it coerces
17 compliance with an otherwise unlawful and unenforceable condition and requirement of the
18 Property Tax Exchange Agreement, is likewise void, unlawful, and unenforceable.

19 38. The City is informed and believes, and alleges thereon, that the City completed its
20 annexation of the Base, specifically including the Site and the WAP Parcel, in January 2004.

21 39. On or about October 12, 2004, the City entered into a development agreement with
22 the developers of the remainder of the former Base property, which was amended in December 2010

23 (the Amended and Restated Development Agreement, or "ARDA").

24 40. As set forth in the ARDA and evidenced by the Site's General Plan and zoning
25 designations, as well as other long range planning documents (e.g., the Southern California
26 Association of Governments' Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy
27 (*SCAG's RTP/SCS")), the Site has long been planned for approximately 300,00 square feet of low

1 impact governmental/institutional uses resulting in a maximum of 6,916 average daily trips
2 ("ADTs").

3 41. However, by 2014, the County had drastically changed its long standing position,
4 and began processing the massive mixed use Project. Even the so-called "reduced density" version

5 of the Project that was ultimately approved by the Board would, as set forth herein, result in the
6 development of thousands of dwelling units and millions of square feet of office, retail and hotel

7 uses, which will result in 35,719 ADTs, approximately five times the amount of traffic that has long
8 been planned for and allocated to the Site. The County unilaterally decided to make this significant
9 change to the well-established long term plan for the Site, steadfastly refusing to allow the City to
10 assert any authority, land use or otherwise, over the Project.

11 The County's Processing and Approval of the Development Plan

12 42. On or about January 28, 2014, the Board approved a Disposition and Development
13 Agreement ("DDA") with Lowe, which set up the framework for the development of both the Site
14 and the WAP Parcel with private, for-profit residential, office, retail and hotel uses, whereby Lowe
15 would take control of the Site from the County pursuant to the Master Ground Lease. The City is
16 informed and believes, and alleges thereon, that the DDA attached a form master ground lease and
17 replacement ground lease, and set forth three phases of developing the Site: (a) Phase 1,
18 entitlements; (b) Phase 2, infrastructure; and (c) Phase 3, vertical development and leasing.

19 43. The City is informed and believes, and alleges thereon, that the County and Lowe
20 collectively prepared the Development Plan to begin the so-called entitlement phase, or "Phase 1",
21 but Lowe was its principal creator. The City is further informed and believes, and alleges thereon,
22 that nothing in the County's Zoning Code authorizes a "development plan" entitlement, which
23 appears to have been created by Lowe and the County specifically for this Project (and the
24 development of the WAP Parcel). In substance, the Development Plan is substantially similar to a
25 specific plan.

26 44. On or about November 7. 2014, the County released the Notice of Preparation
27 ("NOP") of a program environmental impact report ("PEIR") to purportedly analyze the impacts of
28 the development of the Site permitted by the proposed Development Plan. The Development Plan

1 referenced in the NOP and ultimately analyzed as the "project" in the FPEIR would have allowed
2 the development of the Site with 1,876,000 square feet of office uses, 2,103 dwelling units, 220,000
3 square feet of retail, and 242 hotel rooms (the "NOP Project").

4 45. Under Table 2 of the NOP, which is entitled "County of Orange Required
5 Approvals," the NOP lists the first required action as the County Planning Commission making a
6 recommendation to the Board regarding certification of the FPEIR and approval (or denial) of the
7 proposed Development Plan. The County Planning Commission was never permitted to consider
8 or take action on the Project or the FPEIR, and never made any recommendation to the Board.

9 46. On November 4, 2016, the County released the Draft Program EIR No. 620
10 ("DPEIR") (State Clearinghouse No. 2014111019) for public review and comment. The County
11 received many comments from concerned and interested parties pointing out the DPEIR's many
12 significant problems. A number of commenters appeared to be shocked by both the Project's scale
13 and proposed use mix when compared to what has long been publically planned for the Site.

14 47. In particular, on December 19, 2016, the City submitted a detailed comment letter
15 containing hundreds of specific comments setting forth the many deficiencies in the DPEIR and
16 resulting violations of CEQA, as well as a cover letter summarizing selected major issues. The
17 City's comment letter also alerted the County to the fact that the Project violated the Property Tax
18 Exchange Agreement, both the City and the County's General Plans (including Measure W), and
19 the City's Zoning Code (as well as other City Code provisions, standards, requirements and
20 I guidelines).

21 48. Among many other things, the City's letter makes clear that the entire premise upon
22 which the County was processing approval of the Development Plan was flawed. The County has
23 taken the position that regardless of the uses it approves for the Site, the Project is entirely exempt
24 from the City's land use authority and all other potentially applicable land use regulations, standards
25 and requirements. No provision of law supports the County's position that the proposed Project
26 a profit generating mixed use development - is exempt from all City regulation, the City and County
27 General Plans (including Measure W), and/or the Property Tax Exchange Agreement.

11679991.6 a01/12/18 AND COMPLAINT

1 49. In particular, the County's position appears to be based, at least in part, on an
2 incorrect interpretation of Government Code sections 53090 through 53091. Those sections would

3 only be potentially applicable if the Site was being used for County governmental uses, and certainly

4 have no application for the proprietary mixed use Project approved by Respondents here. (See, e.g.,
5 Board of Trustee v. City of Los Angeles (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 45, 50.)

6 50. The County's decision to process the Project under the assumption that the Project is
7 not required to comply with the City's General Plan, Zoning Code or other land use regulations,
8 standards, requirements or design guidelines also resulted in the DPEIR failing to analyze certain
9 impacts and improperly concluding that a number of impacts are less than significant, when they
10 are in fact significant and require mitigation. Further, the County's flawed premise also resulted in
11 the DPEIR concluding that certain significant impacts are unavoidable, when in fact they are
12 avoidable, and can be mitigated to a less than significant level by compliance with City
13 requirements.

14 51. The method by which the future uses will be processed by the County under the
15 Development Plan also creates significant issues. In particular, as explained by the City in its
16 December 19, 2016 letter, the DPEIR improperly analyzes the Project's potential impacts on a
17 programmatic level, even though a number of the Project's uses will potentially avoid any project-
18 level CEQA review because the Development Plan appears to only require administrative (e.g., non-
19 discretionary) approvals for those uses.

20 52. The City's letter also notes that the DPEIR's discussion of so-called "Development
21 Plan measures" consistently and unlawfully compresses its impact analysis with its analysis of
22 mitigation measures. As a result, the DPEIR improperly concludes that a number of impacts are
23 less than significant without first providing a full discussion and analysis of the potential impact
24 before the implementation of any Development Plan measures.

25 53. The City's comments also pointed out a significant number of legal deficiencies
26 (both CEQA and otherwise), factual errors, incomplete analysis and other problems with the DPEIR.
27 In particular, the City detailed the DPEIR's many deficiencies relating to its analysis and
28 conclusions regarding the Project's impacts on aesthetics, air quality, geology and soils, greenhouse

1 gas emissions, hazards and hazardous materials, hydrology and water quality, land use and planning,
2 light and glare, noise, population and housing, public services, recreation/parkland, transportation

3 and traffic, cumulative impacts, and project alternatives.

4 54. On November 3, 2017, the County posted a Notice of Availability and publically
5 released the FPEIR (including the Responses to Comments contained therein) which was to be
6 considered by the Board - without County Planning Commission review - a mere eleven (11)

7 calendar days later. The City, other commenters, members of the public, and the Board were all
8 given less than two weeks to review the FPEIR's changes to the DPEIR, its 1,328 pages of
9 Responses to Comments, and its 14,681 pages of new attachments that were not included in the

10 DPEIR.

11 55. The FPEIR's Responses to Comments were, in large part, nonresponsive to the issues
12 I raised by the City in its December 19, 2016 letter, and we also nonresponsive to issues raised by
13 other commenting parties. Further, the FPEIR failed to correct any of the deficiencies in the DPEIR
14 discussed above and set forth in the City's December 19, 2016 comment letter concerning the same.

15 56. Even though the City had an extremely short time frame in which to review the
16 FPEIR - and in particular, its 381 specific responses to the City's comments, along with thirteen
17 "topical responses" to issues raised by the City and others - on November 13, 2017, the City
18 submitted another letter to the County, pointing out the many deficiencies that remained in the
19 FPEIR, its inadequate Responses to Comments, and the need for the County to recirculate the FPEIR
20 in light of the significant changes and additions to the FPEIR when compared to the DPEIR.

21 57. The City's November 13, 2017 letter summarized and cited to a number of specific
22 responses to comments in the FPEIR that are legally inadequate (see, Pub. Res. Code §§ 21153,
23 2109 & 21092.5; CEQA Guidelines § 15088), including responses to the City's comments
24 concerning land use, recreation/parkland, traffic and transportation (specifically including, inter
25 alia, responses to the City's comments concerning the North Irvine Transportation Mitigation
26 ("NITM") program, traffic thresholds, traffic generation assumptions, the scoping of the traffic
27 impact analysis ("TIA"), and cumulative impacts), greenhouse gas emissions, air quality, noise, the
28 Development Plan/Project descriptions, and the alternatives analysis. The City's

1 November 13, 2017 letter also asserted that at a minimum, the FPEIR sections related to affordable
2 housing, traffic and transportation (including new appendices concerning the same) and greenhouse

3 gas emissions must be recirculated pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21092.1 and CEQA
4 Guidelines section 15088.5.

5 58. On November 14, 2017, despite requests from numerous parties to delay
6 consideration of the Project and FPEIR to allow both the public and the Board adequate time to
7 review the thousands of pages of new material included in the FPEIR, the Board considered the
8 Project at a public hearing. The Board also ignored requests from the public to allow the County
9 Planning Commission to consider the Project and FPEIR first, and make recommendation(s)
10 concerning the same.

11 59. At the Board's November 14, 2017 hearing, staff recommended that the Board certify
12 the FPEIR and approve the Project, although staff recommended that the Board approve the so-
13 called Reduced Intensity and Reduced Density Alternative ("RDA"), discussed as Alternative 3 to
14 the NOP Project in FPEIR. The RDA - and ultimately, the version of the Project that was approved

15 would allow development of 1,000,000 square feet of office uses, 1,998 dwelling units of
16 residential, 200,000 square feet of retail, and 242 hotel rooms, along with the associated

17 I infrastructure.

18 60. Following the public hearing, the Board followed County staff's recommendation
19 approved the Project by a 4-1 vote. As set forth above, the County's approval of the Project
20  consisted of the approval the Resolution, which (a) certified the FPEIR; (b) adopted a Statement of
21 Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations for the FPEIR; (c) adopted an MMRP
22 for the FPEIR; (d) approved the Development Plan, as modified by the RDA set forth as Alternative

23 3 in the FPFIR; and (e) authorized execution of the Master Ground Lease with Lowe in substantially
24 the same form as is attached to the Resolution.

25 61. Also on November 14, 2017, the County filed an NOD, which provided notice that
26 the Board certified the FPEIR and approved the RDA version of the Development Plan (Alternative
27 3) as the Project.

62. As expressly acknowledged by Respondents, the Project as approved will still result

2 in a number of significant, unmitigated impacts. When compared with the NOP Project, the Project

3 as approved does not avoid any significant impacts.

63. Accordingly, the Statement of Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding
5 Considerations approved by Respondents, which are not supported by substantial evidence in the

6 record, concluded that the Project would result in significant and unavoidable impacts on (i) air

7 quality; (ii) land use and planning; (iii) population and housing; and (iv) transportation and traffic.
8 A number of these impacts are avoidable, but Respondents unlawfully failed to impose feasible
9 mitigation or adopt a less impactful alternative to reduce those impacts to a less than significant
10 level.

11 64. Further, Respondents' Statement of Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding
12 Considerations are inadequate as a result of the improper conclusion that a number of the Project's
13 impacts are less than significant, when in fact they are significant and must be mitigated. For
14 example, under the City's standards - which the County chose to ignore - the Project's impacts on
15 recreation are in fact significant, yet they are unmitigated and no finding was made that the Project's
16 impacts on recreation are outweighed or overridden by the Project's purported benefits.

O ∞NaUAWN- A. The FPEIR improperly engages in programmatic level analysis of the
Project's impacts without ensuring that "project level" analysis of specific proposed uses
will occur before each individual use is developed, in violation of CEQA Guidelines section

15168;

B. The FPEIR fails to fully analyze the Project's potential impacts
related to land use by, inter alia, incorrectly assuming that the Project is exempt from City
regulation (including the City's General Plan, Zoning Code, and all other standards,
requirements, regulations and guidelines), failing to analyze the Project's consistency with

10 the County's General Plan (including Measure W). The FPEIR further fails to make a good-

11 faith effort at fully disclosing the Project's conflicts with applicable land use plans, policies
and regulations and the resulting impacts;

12 C.

13 The FPEIR fails to impose feasible mitigation relating to its impacts

14 on land use, and/or adopt a feasible alternative that would reduce such impacts, instead

15 relying solely on vague and uncertain future amendments of the City's General Plan, Zoning

16 Code, SCAG's RTP/SCS and other applicable land use documents and regulations, which
does not actually modify the Project or lessen its impacts;

17 D.

18 The FPEIR's comparisons of the Project to the City's 8.1 Trails and

19 Transit-Oriented Development ("TTOD") zoning designation are misleading, inaccurate and

20 fail to disclose the actual extent of the Project's impacts, and in particular, the full extent of

21 its inconsistency with the City's TTOD Zoning, including but not limited to fact that the

22 many specific uses permitted by the Project would not be permitted or appropriate if the

23 Project was governed by the City's TTOD Zoning. For this reason, among others, the

24 FPEIR's project description (and description of the Development Plan) is misleading and

inaccurate;

25 E.

26 The FPEIR improperly refuses to use City's General Plan, Zoning

27 Code and other standards, requirements, regulations or guidelines as thresholds of

28 significance, which results in an underestimation of impacts and incorrect conclusions

2 on air quality, aesthetics, land use, recreation/parkland, public services, utilities and service

C systems, population and housing, greenhouse gas emissions, hazards and hazardous
materials, noise, and traffic/transportation. Accordingly, the FPEIR fails to properly
identify, disclose and mitigate a number of significant impacts;

F.

N Based on its refusal to use City requirements and standards as
thresholds of significance, the FPEIR improperly concludes that the Project's impacts on

8 parkland would be less than significant because the Project would provide approximately 10

9 acres of parkland, which complies with County standards. However, City standards require

10 approximately 17 acres of parkland, meaning that under the correct threshold of significance,

11 the Project's impacts on parkland are significant, and must be mitigated. Further, the FPEIR

12 improperly considers setbacks (or "linear parks") to be parkland, which do not qualify as

13 such under City (or even County) standards. In sum, the FPEIR's conclusion that the

14 Project's impact on parkland is less than significant is not supported by substantial evidence;

G.

15 The FPEIR also refuses to require compliance with City requirements

16 and standards relating to traffic and transportation, nor does it analyze the Project's impacts

17 using City standards as thresholds of significance, resulting in additional undisclosed

18 significant impacts. In particular, the FPEIR does not comply with the City's Traffic Impact

19 Analysis Guidelines (resulting in, among other things, a stale traffic analysis) and fails

20 accurately describe or implement the City's level of service ("LOS") standards, allowance

21 policy or traffic significance thresholds, which require mitigation back to an acceptable LOS

22 regardless of the ICU increase, unless the baseline condition is already at an unacceptable

23 LOS, in which case the threshold of 0.02 or greater ICU increase applies. The FPEIR also

24 fails to disclose the Project's significant impact resulting from its inconsistency with the

25 ARDA's ADT budget for the site, which the Project will exceed five-fold;

H.

26 The FPEIR also fails to disclose all impacts, improperly defers

27 mitigation/imposes uncertain mitigation, and fails to adopt available, feasible mitigation

- UA0N- to address what happens if County is unable to reach agreement with the City and/or Caltrans
regarding traffic mitigation measures;

I. The FPEIR further improperly refuses to acknowledge and/or fails to
disclose that the Project is responsible for one hundred percent of the improvement costs for
all intersections impacted by the Project except for those with fully funded NITM

A0 improvements (and in the case of partially funded NITM locations, one hundred percent of
the unfunded balance), and defers feasible mitigation by not requiring such funding as
mitigation for both project level and cumulative impacts;
9 J.

10 The FPEIR improperly compresses its discussion of potential project

11 impacts with mitigation measures, when it is instead required to first analyze a potential

12 impact without mitigation, reach a significance conclusion, and then develop and impose

13 mitigation measures. (See, Lotus v. Department of Transportation (2014) 3 Cal.App.4th

14 654). The FPEIR does this by relying on the implementation of "Development Plan

15 measures" to reduce impacts to a less than significant level without mitigation, and does not

16 discuss the potential Project impacts without/before the implementation of the

17 "Development Plan measures," which appear to be, in substance, CEQA mitigation

18 measures. In particular, this defective analysis is present in the FPEIR's analysis of impacts

19 related to aesthetics, hazardous and hazardous materials, hydrology and water quality, light
and glare, noise and public services, as well as other areas of the FPEIR;

20 K.

21 The FPEIR fails to study an adequate and/or reasonable range of

22 alternatives. The only mixed use alternative is Alternative 3, which was ultimately approved
by Respondents as the Project. However, Alternative 3 does not reduce the scale of the

23

24 Project enough to provide a meaningful alternative, which is borne out by the fact that

25 Alternative 3 does not reduce any of the NOP Project's significant impacts to a less than

26 significant level. The City is informed and believes, and alleges thereon, that Alternative 3

27 was the project that Respondents and Lowe sought to approve from the start, meaning that

28 it was never a true alternative, and there was no actual mixed use alternative discussed in the

FPEIR. Further, the FPEIR failed to include a housing-rich mixed use alternative, which

8 M. The FPEIR's analysis of the Project's impacts on air quality is
9 incomplete, does not disclose all impacts (including but not limited to emissions from the

10 nearby railway), defers mitigation, improperly relies on future revisions to the Air Quality

11 Management Plan ("AQMP") to conclude that the Project would not obstruct

12 implementation of the AQMP, and its conclusion that a number of air quality impacts will

13 be less than significant is not supported by substantial evidence;

18 emissions is incomplete, does not disclose all impacts, defers mitigation, and among other

19 things, improperly amortizes construction period greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in

a Ur p w mitigation that has no articulated standards;
X. The FPEIR's decision to rely on thresholds of significance not based
on or in conflict with City Code, requirements, standards, or guidelines is not supported by
substantial evidence;

Y.

N Respondents' Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding

8 Considerations approved by Respondents are legally and factually deficient, and not

9 supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. Respondents also failed to

10 adopt findings to justify the Project's unmitigated, significant impacts in a number of areas

11 because the FPEIR improperly concluded that those impacts are less than significant,

12 including but not limited to impacts on land use, greenhouse gas emissions, public services
and recreation/parkland;

13 Z.

14 The FPEIR's Responses to Comments are nonresponsive and/or

15 otherwise legally inadequate, specifically including, but not limited to, the Responses to

16 Comments regarding land use, recreation/parkland, traffic and transportation, greenhouse

17 gas emissions, air quality, noise, the Development Plan/Project descriptions, and the EIR's

18 alternative analysis, in violation of CEQA and CEQA Guidelines section 15088 in particular;

AA.

19 Significant new information was added the FPEIR, as compared to

20 the DPEIR, such that it was required to be recirculated for public review and comment,

21 pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15088.5. The significant new information in the

22 FPEIR includes, but it is not limited to. additional information relating to the Project's

23 impacts on affordable housing, traffic and transportation, and greenhouse gas

BB. emissions.

24 The FPEIR improperly segmented and/or piecemealed its analysis by

25 analyzing the Project's impacts separately from the similar pending mixed use development

26 of the WAP Parcel, which is proposed by the same developer (Lowe) under the same flawed

27 theory that the County's former Base properties are exempt from all land use regulation.

28 The Project's DPEIR and the draft program EIR for the WAP Parcel were released only

Rutan Tucker, LLP
attorneys at law weeks apart, and the City is informed and believes, and alleges thereon, that the County

AND COMPLAINT

N- plans to release the final program EIR for the WAP Parcel in the first quarter of 2018. The
development of both the Site and the WAP Parcel should be analyzed together, and the

4 County's failure to do so has resulted in understanding the impacts of both the Project and
the proposed development of the WAP Parcel.

68.

6 As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion
by certifying an EIR that does not comply with the requirements of CEQA. As such, Respondents'
7 certification of the FPEIR and approval of the Project must be set aside, Respondents' approval of

8 the Resolution rescinded, and the Court should enjoin Respondents and Lowe from taking any
further action with respect to the Project, until a timely writ of mandate is returned to this Court in
10 compliance with CEQA, and the other applicable land use regulations violated by Respondents and

11 Lowe.

13 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

14 (Writ of Mandate - Inconsistency with the City General Plan and Zoning Code)

69. The City realleges and incorporates by this reference each and every allegation
15 contained in paragraphs 1 through 68 above.

16 70. All public agencies, including the County, have a mandatory duty to refuse to
17 approve any private development project that is inconsistent with the General Plan of the City or
18 County in which the development project is located. Likewise, all public agencies have mandatory
19 duty to refuse approve any private development project that is inconsistent with the relevant
20 property's zoning designation.

21 71. There is no dispute that the Site is located within the jurisdiction of the City, and has
22 been since it was annexed into the City in 2004.

23 72. As acknowledged in the DPEIR, the City's General Plan Land Use Element
24 designates the Site as Orange County Great Park (PA 51) and contemplates development on the Site
25 of 300,00 square feet of County institutional uses and 136,000 square feet of warehousing for
26 homeless shelter providers. The millions of square feet of mixed uses proposed by the Project is
27 clearly inconsistent with the City's General Plan.

11679991.6 a01/12/18 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT

1 73. The City's Zoning Map identifies the Project site as 6.1, Institutional. That zoning
2 designation applies to land for public and quasi-public facilities, including churches, schools, or

3 utilities. Permitted uses within this zoning district include, but are not limited to, agriculture,
emergency shelters, residential shelter, information center, park, school, and wireless
5 communication facilities. The Project is likewise inconsistent and does not comply with its
6 Institutional zoning designation.

7 74. The County does not contend that the Project is consistent with the City's General
8 Plan or Zoning, but instead relies on an argument that "the Project is not required to comply with
9 the City or County General Plan policies or other similar plans and regulations."

10 75. However, because the Project proposes proprietary, non-governmental/institutional
11 uses that will be developed by a Lowe, a private developer, who will lease the Site from the County
12 a for a period of 99 years, the Project is in fact required to comply with the City's General Plan, as
13 well as the City's Zoning Code, requirements, standards, policies, and other "similar plans and
14 regulations", The Property Tax Exchange Agreement, Government Code sections 53090 and
15 53091, or any other provision that would purport to provide the County and/or Lowe with immunity
16 from the City's General Plan, Zoning Code, and other City regulations do not apply and/or extend

17 to a private developer or private project, like the Project here. The Master Ground Lease, FPEIR,
18 and other documents relating to the Project make clear that the Project is Lowe's private
19 development, and the County is not a partner nor in a public private partnership with Lowe.

20 76. Accordingly, because the Project is plainly inconsistent with the City's General Plan
21 and does not comply with the Site's Institutional zoning designation (neither of which are disputed),
22 and a writ must issue overturning Respondents' approval of the Resolution. The County has abused
23 its discretion by approving the Project.

24 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

25 (Writ of Mandate - Inconsistency with the County General Plan)

26 77. The City realleges and incorporates by this reference each and every allegation
27 contained in paragraphs 1 through 76 above.

attorneys at law 2523/048170-1005 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
11679991.6 a01/12/18 AND COMPLAINT

78. Respondents have a mandatory duty to comply with the County General Plan, and
2 refuse to approve any development project that is inconsistent with its Land Use Element.

3 79. The Project, as approved, authorizes uses of the Project that are not permitted by, and
4 are inconsistent with, the County's General Plan, as amended by Measure W.

80. The County has taken the position that, pursuant to the Property Tax Exchange

6 Agreement, is permitted to "place any devclopment upon said parcels the County shall determine to
7 be desirable for County's needs, as though said property remained unincorporated." If the Site had
8 "remained unincorporated," then it would be subject to the County's General Plan.

9 81. The County's General Plan was amended by the voters of Orange County through
10 the adoption of Measure W in 2002, approximately year before the City and County entered into
11 the Property Tax Exchange Agreement. Measure W states that it "amends the Orange County
12 General Plan to authorize the closed [Base] to be used for non-aviation uses, including a multi-
13 purpose central park, open space, nature preserve, universities and schools, cultural facility, and
14 other interim and long-term uses described herein." (See, Measure W § A.) Conspicuously absent
15 is any mention of office, retail, housing or hotel uses.

16 82. Indeed, it was contemplated in the public debate that "about 100 acres would stay
17 under County control for various programs and to provide housing for the homeless." The voters
18 have not since voted to amend, change or repeal Measure W.

19 83. Accordingly, even if true that pursuant to the Property Tax Exchange Agreement, the
20 County is somehow entitled to develop the Site with a private, for-profit development as if the Site
21 was unincorporated, the Project still is inconsistent with the County's General Plan, and therefore a
22 writ must issue overturning Respondents' approval of the Resolution. The County has abused its
23 discretion by approving the Project.

24 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

25 (Writ of Mandate - Failure to Follow Mandatory Procedures)

26 84. The City realleges, and incorporates by this reference each and every allegation
27 contained in paragraphs 1 through 83 above.

1 85. While the "development plan" entitlement does not appear to exist in the County's
2 Zoning Code, it is substantially similar, and for all intents and purposes, a specific plan.

3 86. The County violated its mandatory duties and abused its discretion failing to submit
4 the FPEIR and the Project to the County Planning Commission for review and recommendation
5 before it was submitted to the Board for review and approval, both in violation of state law and the

6 City and County Codes. (See, Government Codc § 65453; County Code § 7-9-5; City Code, Div. 2.)

7 87. The County also violated its mandatory duties and abused its discretion by failing to
8 hold the requisite number of publically noticed hearings before certifying the FPEIR and approving
9 the Project.

10 88. Accordingly, a writ must issue overturning Respondents' approval of the Resolution.

11 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

12 (Breach of Contract and Anticipatory Breach of Contract Against Respondents)

13 89. The City realleges and incorporates by this reference each and every allegation
14 contained in paragraphs 1 through 88 above.

15 90. Respondents' approval of the Project, and particularly the approval of the
16 Development Plan and the Master Ground Lease with Lowe, constitutes an anticipatory material
17 breach and/or a current material breach of Sections 2.2.3 and 2.2.4 of the Property Tax Exchange
18 Agreement in that the approved Development Plan and Master Ground Lease, and each of them,
19 provide for, authorize, and allow uses of the Site, and portions thereof, which are not "Permitted
20  Uses and Facilities," within the meaning of the Property Tax Exchange Agreement, or otherwise
21 permitted.

22 91. As alleged above, Respondents' approval of the Project authorizes, provides for, and
23 allows uses upon the Site which are inconsistent with, among other things, the City's General Plan,
24 the County's General Plan (including Measure W), the City Zoning Code, the County Zoning Code,
25 or each of them, and, as a result, constitute material anticipatory and/or current breaches of Sections
26 2.2.3 and 2.2.4 of the Property Tax Exchange Agreement.

27 92. The fact that the uses permitted by on the Site by the Project are not "Permitted Uses
28 and Facilities" within the meaning of the Property Tax Exchange Agreement, and conflict with the

1 other land use documents set forth above, is further evidence by statement made by the County
2 CEO in an August 22, 2006 letter, in response to the Orange County Grand Jury Report:

3 the County entered into a pre-annexation agreement and property tax agreement

4 with the City of Irvine whereby the County agreed not to oppose Irvine's annexation of the Property. In exchange, Irvine agreed to the County sharing in a certain
a ü percentage of the property taxes as well as receipt of certain parcels of property, totaling approximately 240 acres to be used for certain County purposes such as Youth and Family Resource Center, an animal shelter, childcare facilities, law enforcement training facilities, and an emergency shelter."
0 93. The City has complied with each and every material provision of the Property Tax
8 Exchange Agreement.

9 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

10 (Declaratory Relief)

11 94. The City realleges and incorporates by this reference each and every allegation
12 contained in paragraphs 1 through 93 above.

13 95. The City alleges and declares, and seeks a declaration of this Court as provided
14 below, as follows:

15 A. The Property Tax Exchange Agreement, and specifically Sections

16 2.2.3 and 2.2.4 thereof, requires that the Site, the WAP Parcel, and uses thereupon, are

17 subject to, and remain subject to, the City's General Plan, the City's Zoning Code, the

18 California Subdivision Law, and all other procedures applicable to all public/private

19 developments in the City provided, however, permitted uses, as defined and set forth in

20 Section 2.2.4, shall be allowed on, and constitute permitted uses of, the Site and the WAP

21 Parcel.

22 B. In the Alternative, the Property Tax Exchange Agreement, and

23 specifically Sections 2.2.3 and 2.2.4 thereof, requires that the Site and WAP Parcel, and uses

24 thereupon, are subject to, and remain subject to, the County's General Plan (including

25 Measure W), the County's Zoning Code, the California Subdivision Law, and all other

26 procedures applicable to all public/private developments in the County provided, however,

27 permitted uses, as defined and set forth in Section 2.2.4, shall be allowed on, and constitute

1 C. Sections 2.2.3 and 2.2.4, and each of them, are unlawful, void, and

2 unenforceable in that they, and each of them:

3 (i) constitute an abdication of the City's police power, a violation of
numerous public hearing, public participation, and transparency requirements, and an unlawful
5 delegation and abdication of the City councilmanic police power and land use authority in relation

6 to the Site and the WAP Parcel, and each and every portion thereof, and/or an unlawful attempt to

7 bind future City Councils in relation to their exercise(s) of police power and land use authority;

8 (ii) exceed the authority granted to local agencies in relation to the
9 negotiation and approval of property tax transfer or exchange agreements as provided by Revenue
10 & Taxation Code §§ 99 and 99.02;

11 D. The invalidation of Sections 2.2.3 and 2.2.4 of the Property Tax

2 the WAP Parcel.

3 96. The City is informed and believes, and alleges thereon, that Respondents dispute
4 each and every one of the allegations and declarations set forth in paragraph 94 above, and that an

5 actual controversy exists as to each and every allegation and declaration therein.

6 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

7 (Injunctive Relief)

8 97. The City realleges and incorporates by this reference each and every allegation
9 contained in paragraphs 1 through 96 above.

10 98. If, and to the extent, it is determined that Respondents' approval of the Project and/or
11 the implementation thereof, are violative of law, for whatever reason, the City does, and will,
12 possess no effective legal remedy by way of damages or otherwise.

13 99. If, and to the extent. the approval of the Resolution is deemed to violate law, for
14 whatever reason, the City, as a legal entity, will be irreparably harmed, both in its individual capacity
15 and as a representative of its residents, for, among other reasons, the reasons set forth below:

16 A.

17 The integrity of the City's General Plan, Zoning Code, Building

18 Code, and all other police power regulations of the City will be irreparably impaired and

infirmed.

19 B.

20 The Project will interfere with. impair, and otherwise impede the

21 development of the OCGP, and each and every portion thereof, by way of increased traffic,

22 congestion, noise, pollution, and other impacts which will not be, and cannot be, adequately
mitigated given the size, scope, nature, and composition of the Project.

23 C.

24 The Project will adversely impact the quality of life in adjacent areas,

25 if not the entire City, based upon the traffic, congestion, noise, pollution, greenhouse gas,

26 aesthetics, open space and parkland, and other negative impacts associated with high density
residential and commercial properties.

27 100. Because the County has artificially limited the nature of the Project as to require
28 multiple and sequential additional proceedings, the City would be forced to bring multiplicity of

1 lawsuits in order to address both individual and accumulated adverse impacts related to
2 implementation of the Project, and the various components of the Project.

3 101. The Court should therefore permanently enjoin Respondents and Lowe from
4 implementing the Project, the proposed development of the WAP Parcel, or any development of
5 either the Site or the WAP Parcel with uses that are not consistent with the City's existing General
6 Plan, Zoning Code or any other City regulations, standards, requirements or design guidelines.

7 EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION

8 (Reverse Validation Action)
9 102. The City realleges and incorporates by this reference each and every allegation
10 contained in paragraphs 1 through 101 above.

11 103. Under Code of Civil Procedure sections 860 and 863, City seeks to invalidate each
12 of the authorizations, actions, determinations, findings, and approvals of the Master Ground Lease,
13 the DDA, and like documents (collectively "Contracts") for the reasons set forth in this Petition.

14 104. As required by Code of Civil Procedure section 860, this action has been filed within
15 60 days after the Respondents' final approval of the Contracts and therefore is timely. Pursuant to
16 the Code of Civil Procedure section 860 et seq., Code of Civil Procedure section 1060, and other
17 provisions of law, City requests that each of the unlawful Contracts and approvals relating to the
18 County's authorization on the Site and/or on the WAP (*Approvals") made by one or more of the
19 Respondents be invalidated; that this Court issue one or more peremptory writs of mandamus
20 ordering the Respondents, and/or each of them, to rescind, set aside and invalidate all or part of the
21 unlawful Contracts and Approvals as proven at trial or hearing on this matter; and request that the

22 Court issue a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, and a permanent injunction, all
23 enjoining Respondents and its agents, servants, and employees and subdivisions from approving the
24 Contracts and Approvals absent Respondents' full compliance with legal requirements under State
25 and local laws.

26 105. The Court has jurisdiction over all interested parties by the publication of the

10 County Board of Supervisors, are hereby permanently enjoined and restrained from the institution
11 of any action or proceeding enforcing, or attempting to enforce, in any way, Resolution No. 17-138,
12 and/or any matters herein adjudicated or which at this time could have been adjudicated against all
13 persons interested in these matters.

23 did not comply with the City's General Plan, the County's General Plan, and the required City and
24 County procedures for approving the Development Plan;

25 3. For the issuance of an order that Respondents have breached the Property Tax

Mr. Ngyuen:
This office serves as the City Attorney to the City of Irvine. This letter is provided to the County of Orange ("County") in accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167.5.
Please take notice that on or before December 14, 2017, pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167, the City of Irvine will file a Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint (*Petition") challenging the County's November 14, 2017 approval of the El Toro 100-Acre Development Plan (the "Development Plan") and its certification of the Final Program Environmental Impact Report No. 620 for the Development Plan ("FPEIR"). The Petition will allege, among other things, that the County did not comply with the California Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq.) when it approved the proposed Project and certified the FPEIR.

PROOF OF SERVICE

2 (City of Irvine v. County of Orange, et al.

3 Orange County Superior Court, Civil Complex Center Case No. 30-2017-00961107-CU-WM-CXC)
4 STATE OF CALIFORNIA, COUNTY OF ORANGE

. am employed by the law office of Rutan & Tucker, LLP in the County of Orange, State of
6 California. I am over the age of 18 and not a party to the within action. My business address is

7 611 Anton Boulevard, Suite 1400, Costa Mesa, California 92626-1931.
On January 12, 2018, I served on the interested parties in said action the within:
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (C.C.P. §§ 1085, 1094.5) AND COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, BREACH OF CONTRACT, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DECLARATORY RELIEF
10
as stated below:
11 X
12 (BY MAIL) by placing a true copy thereof in sealed envelope(s) addressed as shown on the attached service list.

13 In the course of my employment with Rutan & Tucker, LLP, I have, through first-hand personal observation, become readily familiar with Rutan & Tucker, LLP's practice of collection 14 and processing correspondence for mailing with the United States Postal Service. Under that practice, deposited such envelope(s) in an out-box for collection by other personnel of Rutan & 15 Tucker, LLP, and for ultimate posting and placement with the U.S. Postal Service on that same day in the ordinary course of business. If the customary business practices of Rutan & Tucker, LLP 16 with regard to collection and processing of correspondence and mailing were followed, and I am confident that they were, such envelope(s) were posted and placed in the United States mail at Costa 17 Mesa, California, that same date. I am aware that on motion of party served, service is presumed invalid if postal cancellation date or postage meter date is more than one day after date of deposit 18 for mailing in affidavit.

19 Executed on January 12, 2018, at Costa Mesa, California.

20 I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the foregoing
IS true and correct.
