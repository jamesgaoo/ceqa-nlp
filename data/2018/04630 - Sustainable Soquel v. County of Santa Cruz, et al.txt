27

28 PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Priaied on Boeychad Tuper

OF SUPERVISORS (collectively, the "County"), setting aside Respondents' approval of a Nissan
11

automobile dealership and service area (the "Project") in Soquel, California. Project approvals
include Resolution 129-2018 certifying a Final Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") and
amending the General Plan, as well as rezoning Ordinance No. 5274, a Commercial Development
Permit, a Grading Permit and Sign Exception, and Roadway and Roadside Exception.

2. Petitioner contends the approvals must be set aside because (1) the County violated

8 the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") by failing to perform adequate environmental

9 review and (2) the Project is inconsistent with the Santa Cruz County Code and General Plan, as
io well as the Sustainable Santa Cruz County Plan.("SSCCP").

11 IL. THE PARTIES

12 3. Petitioner and Complainant, SUSTAINABLE SOQUEL, is a neighborhood
13 association concerned with sustainable and appropriate development in the unincorporated area of
14 Soquel. Members of the SUSTAINABLE SOQUEL work, reside and recreate in Soquel and Santa
15

16 Cruz County. SUSTAINABLE SOQUEL brings this action on its own behalf, for its members,

17 and in the public interest.

18 4. Respondent and Defendant, COUNTY OF SANTA CRUZ, is a local governmental
19 ageney and a political subdivision of the State of California with the authority to regulate and
20 administer land use and development within its territory, but only in compliance with the duly
21 adopted provisions of its zoning ordinances, General Plan, Community Plans, Development Code
22

23 and all applicable provisions of state law, including CBQA, the Planning and Zoning law, and the

24 Subdivision Map Act. The County is the lead agency for the Project. The County is responsible

25 for insuring that the agencies, instrumentalities, officials, and employees of the County comply
26 with the Laws of the State of California. Respondent SANTA CRUZ COUNTY BOARD OF

SUPERVISORS (the "Board") is the legislative body and highest administrative body in the
2 County. The Board has the authority to approve or disapprove proposed development applications
3 and other land use entitlements.

4 5. Petitioner does not know the identity of DOES 1-25 but will amend the Petition as
5 required to specifically identify each such person or entity as a defendant if the identity, interest
6 and capacity of such party, if any, becomes known.
7
6. Real Party in Interest Don Groppetti is an individual who owns the Project site and

0 intends to develop and operate a Nissan Dealership at that location. Petitioner is informed and

10 believes and, on that basis, alleges that the Real Party in Interest has an interest in the subject of
11 this litigation by virtue of being a project applicant/representative, a recipient of project
12| approval(s), or having an ownership interest in the subject of this litigation.
13 7. Petitioner does not know the identity of ROES 26-50 but will amend the Petition as
14

15 required to specifically identify each such person or entity as a real party in interest if the identity,

16 interest and capacity of such party, if any, becomes known.

17 III. PROCEDURAL ALLEGATIONS

18 8. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant action
19 and has exhausted any and all administrative remedies to the extent required by law, by inter alia,
20 submitting written comments on the issues that are the subject of this lawsuit during the
21 administrative process. Petitioner has requested that the County not approve the Project and not to
22

23 certify the EIR, therefore, any further attempts to pursue administrative remedies would be futile.

24 9. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code ("Pub.

25 Res. Code") § 21167.5 by mailing a written notice of the commencement of this action to
26 | Respondent prior to filing this petition and complaint. A true and correct copy of this notice is

27

28 PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE REUEF

Pirufed oo Rsosekat Eigur

attached hereto as Exhibit "A".

2 10. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Pub. Res. Code § 21167.7 and
3 Code of Civil Procedure § 388 by mailing a copy of the Petition/Complaint to the state Attorney

4 General.

5 11. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law
6

7 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside the

8 Project approvals until they have adequately complied with CEQA and the SSCCP. In the absence

9 of such remedies, the County's approvals will remain in effect and in violation of CEQA.

10 12. If the County is not enjoined from approving the Project, and from undertaking acts
11 in furtherance thereof, Petitioner will suffer irreparable harm from which there is no adequate

12 remedy at law in that the Project area and surrounding area would be irrevocably altered and
13 significant adverse impacts on the environment and community would result. Petitioner and the
14 general public will also be harmed by the County's failure to comply with the County's own
15

16 guidelines and regulations.

17 13. In pursuing this action, which involves enforcement of important rights affecting
18 general public, citizens of Soquel and the County of Santa Cruz and the State of California,
19 Petitioner will therefore be entitled to attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to, inter alia, Code of
20 Civil Procedure §1021.5.
21 14. Petitioner brings this action in part pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §1085 or
22

23 §1094.5, which require that an agency's approval of a Project be set aside if the agency has

24 prejudicially abused its discretion. Prejudicial abuse of discretion occurs either where an agency

25 has failed to proceed in a manner required by law or where its determination or decision i not
26 supported by substantial evidence. Respondents have prejudicially abused their discretion because

27

28 PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Pritoif en Racycled Paey

1 Respondents have failed to proceed according to the law, and their decision approving the Project
2 not supported by substantial evidence.

3 IV. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

15. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
5 §§ 1085 and 1094.5. Venue is proper in this Court because the action concerns real property and a
6 proposed project located in Santa Cruz County.
7
V.
8 STATEMENT OF FACTS

9 16. The Project site is located within the Soquel Planning Area fronting Soquel Drive
10 and 415t Avenue and is included in the Sustainable Santa Cruz County Plan ("SSCCP") area. The
11 Project proposes to combine eight parcels totaling approximately 2.6 acres to construct an
12 approximately 12,550 square foot automobile dealership with an approximately 10,000 square foot
13 service area.
14
17. The Project is so ill-suited for the site area and inconsistent with the underlying land
15

16 use designation that the County had to grant the developer many variances from local zoning and

17 planning regulations in order to approve the Project. The County approved a General Plan
18 Amendment to re-designate a portion of the Project site's zoning from C-C (Community
19 Commercial) to C-S (Service Commercial) and rezoned another portion of the site from C-2

20 (Community Commercial) to C-4 (Service Commercial). In addition, the Project requested a Sign
21 Exception and a Roadway and Roadside Exception.
22
18. A draft EIR wäs prepared and circulated on December 27, 2017 for a 45-day public
23

24 review period ending on February 12, 2018, which was later extended to end on February 2018, to

25 solicit agency and public input on the analysis of the potential environmental effects associated

26

27

28 PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

n Recrcied Rapor

with the construction and operation of the Project. A final ElR consisting of responses to

comments and changes to the draft EIR was completed and released on April 13, 2018.

19. The Final EIR (FEIR) identified potentially significant environmental effects

4 related to cultural resources, hazards and hazardous materials and noise. The FEIR concluded the

5 impacts associated with transportation/traffic would be significant and unavoidable owing to the
6 uncertainty surrounding sources of funding. However, without any adequate explanation or

8 identifying substantial evidence, the County later reversed its earlier conclusion regarding the

9 feasibility of traffic mitigation and concluded that installation of traffic signals would be feasible

10 within five years.

11 20. On April 25, 2018 the Planning Commission held a public hearing recommending
12| that the Board certify the FEIR. The Board held a public hearing on May 22, 2018 where it
13 certified the FEIR and approved the Project.
14 21. The County found that the General Plan amendment changing the land use
15

16 designation of property located within the Soquel planning area, as well as approving a

17 Commercial Development Permit, Sign Exception, and Roadway and Roadside Exception, were
18 appropriate and consistent with the County of Santa Cruz General Plan. The County also made a
19 finding that rezoning the site was appropriate because the surrounding area is characterized by uses
20 associated with C-4 zone district and C-S land use designation. The County relied on Santa Cruz
21 County Code section 13.10.597 to justify the approval of a sign exception. The Roadway and
22

23 Roadside Exception was approved to vary from the existing 415t Avenue and Soquel Drive plan

24 lines.

25 22. Public comments, including those submitted by Petitioner, established that the EIR
26 does not adequately analyze the setting or the Project impacts, does not include a reasonable and

27

28 PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Peated on Rooyeled Puoer

accurate set of project objectives, does not adequately analyze project alternatives and fails to

2 identify and adequately analyze feasible mitigation measures. As set forth more fully below, the

3 County violated CEQA because there is no substantial evidence in the record supporting the
4 County's findings in support of Project approvals and certification of the FEIR.
5 23. Further, neither the EIR nor the Staff Reports ever adequately analyze the Project's
consistency with the applicable Sustainable Santa Cruz County Plan (*SSCCP"), which includes a

8 number of goals and policies intended to "reduce greenhouse gas emissions while simultaneously
improving other aspects of community life including increasing walkability in the area, limiting
10 urban sprawl, supporting alternative modes of transportations, and strengthening local economies."

11 County staff attempted to justify this failure by claiming the County never formally adopted the

12 SSCCP. This claim, however, is not supported by the evidence in the record, which to the
13 contrary, shows the Board of Supervisors formally adopted the SSCCP and directed the Planning
14 Staff to begin the process of its implementation.
15
24.
16 The DEIR does not identify reasonable Project objectives, which include such

17 objectives of paying taxes to the County of Santa Cruz (instead of the City of Santa Cruz), or to
18 combine several parcels into one larger parcel, because they are not reasonably related to the
19 proponents obvious and main goal- which is to build and operate an auto dealership at this
20 location.
21 25. The EIR fails to adequately describe the bascline environmental conditions by, for
22

23 example, ignoring the obvious potential for development in the area. Moreover, the EIR does not

24 include a reasonable assessment of baseline noise levels, which in turn undermines the DEIR's

25 ability to adequately analyze the Project's potential noise impact on the surrounding neighborhood.

26 26. In order to justify its support for the Project despite its manifest inconsistency with

27

28 PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Piatiod en Reeretal Fapor

the recently adopted SSCCP, the County Staff repeatedly claimed the SSCCP is not a formally

2 "adopted" plan. This contention is demonstrably false as the record shows the County formally
3 adopted the SSCCP, which is also incorporated in various sections of the General Plan, including

4 the Housing Element.

5 27. The County's decision to approve the Project was based in part on the dubious
6 notion that developing the Project site is not suitable for mixed use development. As numerous
7

8 members of the public pointed out, this conclusion is not supported by the evidence and the

9 common understanding that in the current extremely tight housing market, particularly in Santa
10 Cruz County, there would likely be incredible demand for mixed use housing development in
11 Soquel.

12 CEQA Mandates

13 28. CEQA was enacted to require public agencies and decision-makers to document
14 and consider the environmental implications of their actions before formal decisions are made.
15

16 Public Resources Code ("Pub. Res. C.") §21000, and to "[e]nsure that the long-term protection of

17 the environment shall be the guiding criterion in public decisions." Pub. Res. C §21001(d)
18 *CEQA was intended to be interpreted in such a manner as to afford the fullest possible protection
19 to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory authority." 14 California Code of
20| Regulations, (hereinafter cited as "CEQA Guidelines") §15003(f), citing Friends of Mammoth y.
21 Board of Supervisors (1972) 8 Cal. 3d 247. "[T]he overriding purpose of CEQA is to ensure that
22

23 agencies regulating activities that may affect the quality of the environment give primary

24 consideration to preventing environmental damage. CEQA is the Legislature's declaration of
25 policy that all necessary action be taken 'to protect, rehabilitate and enhance the environmental
26 quality of the state. Save Our Peninsula v. Monterey County Board of Supervisors (2001) 87

Cal.App.4th 99, 117, citing Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of

2 California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 373, 392; and Pub. Res. C 8 21000.

29. The lead agency must identify all potentially significant impacts of the project and
must therefore consider all the evidence in the administrative record, not just its initial study. Pub.

5 Res. C. §21080 (c), (d), §21082.2. CEQA Guidelines direct lead agencies to conduct an Initial
6 Study to "determine if the project may have a significant on the environment." §15063(a). "All
7

8 phases of the project planning, implementation, and operation must be considered in the Initial

9 Study". CEQA Guidelines §15063(a)(1). Besides the direct impacts, the lead agency must also
10 consider reasonably foreseeable indirect physical changes in the environment in the area in which
11 significant effects would occur, directly or indirectly. See CEQA Guidelines §15064(d) &
12 §15360, see, also, Laurel Heights Improvement Assn, supra, 47 Cal. Ed at 392.
13 30. An indirect impact is a physical change in the environment, not immediately related
14 to the project in time or distance but caused indirectly by the project and reasonably foreseeable.
15

16 CEQA Guidelines $15064(d)(2) & §15358(a)(2). Indirect impacts to the environment caused by a

17 project's economic or social effects must be analyzed if they are "indirectly caused by the project,
18| are reasonably foreseeable, and are potentially significant." CEQA Guidelines $15064(d)-(e). A
19 lead agency may not limit environmental disclosure by ignoring the development or other activity
20 that will ultimately result from an initial approval. City of Antioch v..City Council (1986) 187
21 CA3d 1325 (emphasis added).
22
31. Where the CEQA environmental process was procedurally or substantively
23

24 defective, reviewing courts may find prejudicial abuse of discretion even if proper adherence to

25 CEQA mandates may not have resulted in a different outcome. Pub. Res. Code $21005(a). For

26 example, the Court in Citizens to Preserve Ojai v. County of Ventura (1985) 176 Cal.App.3d 421,

27

28 PETITIÓN FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

•Nined tn Reiyelad Aapvy

428 held that the certification of an EIR that had not adequately discussed the environmental

2 impacts of the project constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion even if strict compliance with

3 the mandates of CEQA would not have altered the outcome. The Court in Resource Defense Fund
v. LAFCO (1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 886, 897-8, went so far as to declare that failure to comply with
CEQA procedural requirements was per se prejudicial. The court in Kings County Farm Bureau v.
City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692 explained that an agency commits prejudicial error if

8 "the failure to include relevant information precludes informed decision making and informed
public participation, thereby thwarting the statutory goals of the EIR process." Id., at 712. •O

10 32. CEQA's environmental review process is intended to provide the public with

11 assurances that "the agency has, in fact, analyzed and considered the ecological implications of its
12 actions." Laurel Heights Improvement Ass.v. Regents of the University of California (1988) 47
13 Cal.3rd 376, 392. The function of the environmental review, then, is not merely to result in
14 informed decision making on the part of the agencies, it is also to inform the public so they can
15

16 respond to an action with which they disagree. Id.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 17. (Violation of CEQA)
18 33. SUSTAINABLE SOQUEL refers to and incorporates herein by this reference all
19

20 preceding paragraphs, inclusive, of this Petition as though fully set forth herein,

21 34. CEQA requires a lead agency to prepare an EIR that complies with the
22 requirements of the statute. An EIR must provide sufficient environmental analysis such that
23 decision-makers can intelligently consider environmental consequences when acting on proposed
24 projects.
25 35. The County violated CEQA by certifying an EIR that is inadequate and fails to
26 comply with CEQA requirements. Among other things, Petitioner claims the EIR:
27

28 PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Prded on Recyciod. Paper

2
GJ (1) Failure to properly define accurate and reasonable Project objectives; the

listed objectives are artificially and narrowly drawn in order to curtail

a u analysis of alternatives to the Project
(2) Failure to identify an adequate range of Project alternatives, or to adequately

0 analyze the objectives that were identified in the EIR, including the
alternative of using the Project site for mixed-use or other suitable

development;

10
11 (3) Failure to adequately analyze the Project's potential environmental impacts,

12 including traffic, air quality, climate change and noise;

13 (4) Failure to identify all potentially feasible mitigation measures;

14

15 (5) Failure to adequately analyze the Project's consistency with the County

16 General Plan, particularly the Housing Element, and the SSCCP;

17 (6) Failure to identify the SSCCP as an adopted plan that is incorporated into

the General Plan;

18

19 (7) Failure to consider, propose, and analyze all potentially feasible mitigation

20 measures that could reduce the Project's direct, indirect and cumulative

21 impacts. For example, the County and the FEIR. fail to adequately analyze

22

23 the potential feasibility of traffic mitigation measures, including traffic

24 signals and a last-minute measure that requires the dealership to take

25 delivery of new cars inside the dealership and never on the street;

26 (8) Failure to adequately assess the Project's consistency with the surrounding

27 area, including nearby residential developments;
(9) Failure to properly notify responsible and trustee agencies.

36. Despite its many inadequacies, the final EIR nevertheless admits that even with
2 imposition of all proposed mitigation measure, the Project would still have significant and
3 unmitigable traffic impacts. Pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15021, the County was

4 required but failed to identify and adopt all feasible mitigation measures or feasible project
5 alternatives that can substantially avoid or substantially lessen the significant environmental

effects.

37. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused its discretion
because the findings are not supported by substantial evidence and by certifying an EIR that does
10 not comply with CEQA and by approving the Project in reliance thereon. Accordingly,
11 Respondents® certification of the EIR and approval of the Project must be set aside.

12 WHEREFORE, SUSTAINABLE SOQUEL prays for judgment against the County of
13 Santa Cruz and Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors, as set forth below.
14 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
15 (Violation Planning Laws: Inconsistency with General Plan, SSCCP and County Code)

16 38. SUSTAINABLE SOQUEL refers to and incorporates herein by this reference all
17 preceding paragraphs, inclusive, of this Petition as though fully set forth herein.
18 39. The Project, as proposed, conflicts with and is inconsistent with many of the goals
19

20 and policies of the General Plan and the SSCCP, as well as provisions of the County Municipal

21 Code, including but not limited to the following.

22 40. Pursuant to Santa Cruz County Code §13.11.072 "[i]t shall be the objective of new
23 development to enhance or preserve the integrity of existing land use patterns or character..."
24 Approval of the Project violates the County's own code, which seeks to implement the General
25 Plan, by granting significant variances from the established standards and guidelines without
26 adequate justification.
27

28 PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 12.

Pried oe (tocy clad taper

41. The Project is inconsistent with Housing Element goals, policies, programs and
2 objectives directing the County to encourage and assist in the development of housing and

3 preserving the existing housing stock, and to revise zoning where appropriate to encourage added

4 density. (Housing Elements Goals 1-5, etc.)

42. The Project is inconsistent with the SSCCP, including policies that recommend
locating new hosing near transportation corridors, and explicitly recognizes that underutilized
commercial sites such as the site here are prime candidates for updated commercial and residential
development. The SSCCP identified the Project site as a prime candidate for this type of mixed use

10 development.

11 43. Owing to its location and proximity to residential neighborhoods, the General Plan

12 and underlying zoning identified this site as suitable for Community Commercial and mixed use,
13 but the Project is primarily an auto-dealership which is by its nature a regional commercial use.
14

15 The County Staff and the EIR attempt to obscure and understate this inconsistency by emphasizing

16 the service component of the Project. This emphasis, however, does not change the fact that the

17 Project at its core is an auto-dealership with a service station, and not neighborhood service
18 station with an added auto-dealership component.
