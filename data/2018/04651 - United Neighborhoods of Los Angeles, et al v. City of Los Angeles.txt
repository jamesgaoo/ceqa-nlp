VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

INTRODUCTION
1.
2 This action challenges and seeks to enjoin the CITY OF LOS ANGELES ("City" or

3 "Respondent") pattern and practice of approving tree removals as part of the Safe Sidewalks LA
Program ("Safe Sidewalks LA Program" or "Program') despite the Program currently undergoing
4 CEQA environmental review.
5 2. The tree removals being approved under the Safe Sidewalks LA Program is collectively

6 having a devastating impact on the urban tree canopy in the City of Los Angeles. In 2017 alone, the Cityl

7 approved the removal of approximately 142 trees- an incredibly large amount of mature trees that

8 provide significant canopy cover necessary to mitigate against global climate change.

9 3. In approving tree removals under the Safe Sidewalks LA Program, Respondents violated

10 the California Environmental Quality Act, Cal: Pub Res. Code § 21000 et seq ("CEQA"), by approving

11 and proceeding with implementation of the Program as well as well as other tree removals under the

12 Safe Sidewalks LA Prograr without having completed environmental review.
4. The City's own Initial Study on the Safe Sidewalks LA Program, a true and correct copy
13 of which is attached as Exhibit A ("Initial Study"), concluded that a full environmental impact report
14 ("EIR") on the Program was required by CEQA, admitted that the City's current pattern and practice of
15 categorically exempting sidewalk repairs and tree removals under the Program violated CEQA, noting

16 that:

17 Sections 15300 to 15322 of the State CEQA Guidelines identify classes of projects that

18 are categorically exempt from provisions of CEQA because they do not ordinarily result

19 in a significant effect on the environment. Minor repairs to existing sidewalks typically fit
the definition of a Class
20 existing facility identified under Section 15301(c). As the
Proposed Project consists of a long-term sidewalk repair program, with an expected
21 consistent level of funding and activities, additional review under CEQA is required to
22 analyze the impact of these activities collectively, over time. The proposed Project will
23 potentially result in the removal of large quantities of mature street trees, as well as

24 temporary street and sidewalk closures during construction activities.

25 Initial Study at 2-4.

26 PARTIES

27 5. Plaintiff and Petitioner UNITED NEIGHBORHOODS FOR LOS ANGELES, an

28 unincorporated association ("UN4LA") is a community organization composed of residents of the City
of Los Angeles frustrated by City Hall's unwillingness to listen to their concerns about poor planning,
--
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

the lack of affordable housing, green space crumbling infrastructure and inconsistent enforcement of

2 building codes. Members of UN4LA live, work and recreate in the area surrounding the Tree Removal

3 and would be negatively impacted, including by substantially affecting its members' property rights, if
the Tree Removal were to move forward.
4 6. Petitioner EASTSIDE NATURE ALLIANCE, an unincorporated association ("ENA" or
5 collectively with UN4LA as "Petitioners") is a community organization composed of residents of the

6 City concerned about the preservation of open space, green space and the urban tree canopy here in the

7 City. Members of ENA live, work and recreate in the area around the Tree Removal and would be

8 negatively impacted, including by substantially affecting its members' property rights, if the Tree

9 Removal were to move forward.

10 7. Defendant and Respondent CITY OF LOS ANGELES ("City" or "Respondent**) is a

11 California charter city located in the County of Los Angeles, California.
8. Defendants and Respondents DOES 1 - 10 are entities which the true names, capacities,
12 corporate, associate are unknown to Petitioners at this time who, therefore, sues said Respondents by
13 fictitious names. Petitioners will amend this Petition to show the true names and capacities when
14 ascertained.

15 9. Real Parties in Interest ROES 1 - 10 are entities which the true names, capacities,

16 corporate, associate are unknown to Petitioners at this time who, therefore, sues said Real Parties in

17 Interest by fictitious names. Petitioners will amend this Petition to show the true names and capacities

18 when ascertained.

19 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

10. Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and section 1085 and
20 Public Resources Code sections 21168, 21168.5 and 21168.9, this Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ
21 of mandate to set aside Respondents' decision to certify the EIR/EIS and purported approval of the
22 Project.
23 11. Venue is proper in this Court because the Project lies entirely within the County of Los
24 Angeles and the environmental impacts of the Project will be acutely felt in this County. The cause

25 alleged in this Petition, or some part of that cause, arise in this county. (CCP § 393; Cal. State Parks

26 Foundation v. Super. Ct. (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 826.) Venue is also proper in this Court pursuant to

27 Code of Civil Procedure Sections 394 (actions against a city, county or local agency), and 395 (actions

28 generally) since the City of Los Angeles is in the County of Los Angeles.
12. This petition is timely filed.
-2-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

13. Petitioner has provided written notice of their intention to file this petition to Respondent

2 in compliance with Public Resources Code section 21167.5, and are including the notice and proof of
service as Exhibit B.
3 14. Petitioner has concurrently filed a notice of their election to prepare the record of
4 administrative proceedings relating to this action, in compliance with Public Resources Code Section
5 21167.6 or other applicable laws, and are including the notice of this election as Exhibit C.

6 15. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing this instant action and have

7 exhausted administrative remedies to the extent required by law under Public Resources Code section

8 21177. Petitioner and/or other agencies and individuals raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in

9 this petition orally or in writing during the Respondents' decision-making process.

10 16. The violations by Respondent as alleged herein have affected the beneficial interests of

11 Petitioners and/or their supporting members. The relief sought by way of this Petition will redress this
beneficial interest and the likelihood of future injury and interference with Petitioners' interests, and
12 those of its supporting members.
13 17. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law unless
14 this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondent to set aside its certification of the
15 Project and environmental documents. In the absence of such remedies, Respondent's decisions will

16 remain in effect in violation of state law and injurious to Petitioners.

17 STATUTORY FRAMEWORK

18 California Environmental Quality Act
18.
19 CEQA requires state and local agencies to identify the potentially significant

20 environmental impacts of their actions, and then to avoid or mitigate those impacts if feasible.
19. CEQA requires that, prior to approving and implementing project subject to CEQA, an
21 agency analyze the potential environmental impacts of its proposed actions in an EIR (except in certain
22 limited circumstances). (See, e.g., PRC § 21100, et seq. The EIR is the very heart of CEQA. (Dunn-
23 Edwards v. BAAQMD (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 644, 652.) "The 'foremost principle' in interpreting CEQA

24 is that the Legislature intended the act to be read so as to afford the fullest possible protection to the

25 environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language." (Cmtys. for a Better Env't v. a Cal.

26 Resources Agency (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98, 109.)

27 20. CEQA has two primary purposes. First, CEQA is designed to inform decision makers and

28 the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of a project prior to approval. (14 Cal.
Code Reg. ("CEQA Guidelines") § 15002(a)(1).) "Its purpose is to inform the public and its responsible
-3-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- officials of the environmental consequences of their decisions before they are made. Thus, the EIR

2 *protects not only the environment but also informed self-government.3 (Citizens of Goleta Valley v.

3 Bd. of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564 [emphasis added]). The EIR has been described as "an

4 environmental 'alarm bell' whose purpose it is to alert the public and its responsible officials to

5 environmental changes before they have reached ecological points of no return." (Berkeley Keep Jets

6 Over the Bay v. Bd. of Port Comrs. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1354 ("Berkeley Jets").)
21.

7 Second, CEQA requires public agencies to avoid or reduce environmental damage when

8 "feasible" by requiring "environmentally superior" alternatives and all feasible mitigation measures. (14

9 § CCR § 15002(a)(2) and (3); Citizens of Goleta Valley, supra, 52 Cal.3d at 564.) The EIR serves to
provide agencies and the public with information about the environmental impacts of a proposed project

10 and to "identify ways that environmental damage can be avoided or significantly reduced." (CEQA

11 Guidelines § 15002(a)(2).).
22.
12 Finally, CEQA requires public agencies to consider the environmental effects of a Project

13 prior to approving a Project as part of a public agency's decision-making process. Section 21002.1(d) of

14 the Cal. Public Resources Code requires a public agency to "consider[] the effects, both individual and
collective, of all activities involved in a project."
15 23.

16 CEQA requires that a public agency considers approval of a Project concurrently with the

17 public agency's decision as to whether to approve or disapprove a specific project. Section 21003(a) of

18 the Cal. Public Resources Code specifically requires that [l]ocal agencies integrate the requirements of
this division with planning and environmental review procedures otherwise required by law or by local

19 practice so that all those procedures, to the maximum feasible extent, run concurrently, rather than

20 consecutively.
24.
21 Consistent with the mandate that the CEQA process runs concurrently with a public

22 agency's decision as to whether to approve or disapprove a specific project, CEQA requires that a public

23 agency considers a project's environmental impacts when "determining whether to approve the project"
CEQA Guidelines § 15093(a).

24 25.

25 A project is approved for the purposes of CEQA when a public agency commits "to a
definite course of action.

26 15352). [including an] entitlement for use of the project." (CEQA Guidelines

27 26. An agency cannot adopt a CEQA determination for a Project prior to approval of a

28 project. (Cty. of Amador v. El Dorado Cty. Water Agency, 76 Cal. App. 4th 931, 965 (1999) (citing CEQA
Guidelines § 15352(a); Coalition for Clean Air v. City of Visalia (2012) 209 Cal. App. 4th 408, 423.)
-4-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

27. Similarly, a CEQA determination cannot be adopted after project has been approved.

2 Save Tara v. City of West Hollywood (2008) 45 Cal. 4th 116, 127, 132 (finding that subsequent

3 "preparation and certification of an EIR" does not render a lawsuit moot and that "an agency has no
discretion to define approval so as to make its commitment to a project precede the required preparation 4 of an EIR.").
5 28. CEQA requires that public agency allow the public to appeal a CEQA determination to a
6 public "agency's elected decision making body." (PRC § 21151(c)). A CEQA determination and project|
7 approval is not "final" until "the final adjudicatory administrative decision." (Hensler v. City of

8 Glendale (1994) 8 Cal. 4th 1, 22).

9 29. The required CEQA environmental review involves both substantive and procedural

10 steps. Public participation plays an important and protected role in the CEQA process. (Laurel Heights

11 Improvement Association v. Regents of the University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392 (*The
EIR process protects not only the environment but also informed self government."); Concerned 12 Citizens of Costa Mesa, Inc. v. 32nd District Agricultural Association (1986) 42 Cal.3d 929, 936 13 (members of the public have a "privileged position" in the CEQA process)), "Each public agency should 14 include provisions in its CEQA procedures for wide public involvement, formal and informal, consistent
15 with its existing activities and procedures, in order to receive and evaluate public reactions to
16 environmental issues related to the agency's activities." (CEQA Guidelines§ 15201). The lead agency
17 must consider all scomments it receives on a draft environmental impact report, proposed negative

18 declaration, or proposed mitigated declaration." (PRC § 21091(d)(1); CEQA Guidelines § 15074(b)).
30.
19 Procedurally, a lead agency may not approve a project until the public has been given

20 full and adequate opportunity to participate and comment on the project.
31. CEQA also disallows approval of a project that fails to comply with other laws. A lead 21 agency may not approve a project with significant unavoidable impacts unless it is "otherwise
22 permissible under applicable laws and regulations." (PRC § 21002.1(c).)
23 California Street Improvement Act of 1911, Los Angeles Municipal Code Section 62.104 and
24 Sidewalk Repair and Maintenance

25 32. The California Improvement Act of 1911, Cal. Streets and Highways Code §§ 5000, et
26 seq ("Improvements Act") imposes responsibility on property owners in front of a public street to

27 maintain sidewalks to "not endanger persons or property" or "interfere with the public convenience."

28 (Cal. Streets and Highways Code §§5610.)
33. In 1974, the City adopted LAMC Section 62.104, Ordinance No. 146,040 exempting
-5-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

property owners from responsibility for sidewalk repairs caused by street tree root growth. In 2016, the

2 City amended LAMC Section 62.104 to remove the exemption for street tree root growth, placing
responsibility for maintaining sidewalks on property owners, as well as providing a rebate and incentive
program incentivizing property owners to repair the sidewalks in front of their properties. (LAMC !
4 62.104, Ordinance No. 184,596.) Property owners are required to obtain a permit from the City prior to
5 attempting any sidewalk repair. (LAMC § 62.105).

6 Street Trees Under The Los Angeles Municipal Code

7 34. The City, through the Board of Public Works ("Board"'), has exclusive jurisdiction and

8 control over all street trees within the City. (LAMC § 62.161 - 176.)

9 35. Prior to planting, removing, or otherwise injuring any street trees within the City, a

10 person must obtain a permit from the Board. (LAMC §§ 62.162, 62.169.)
36.
11 On June 17, 2015, the Board approved a Street Tree Removal and Tree Replacement
Condition Policies which designated the Chief Forester of the City's Bureau of Street Services to issue
12 street tree removal permits, and required public notice, comment and hearing for any street tree removal
13 permits involving three or more trees, as well as that any permitted street tree removal be mitigated on a
14 2:1 basis.

15 Constitutional Due Process Requirements

16 37. The term "due process of law" asserts a "fundamental principle of justice which is not

17 subject to any precise definition but deals essentially with the denial of fundamental fairness, shocking

18 to the universal sense of justice." (Ursino v. Superior Court (1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 611, 621, quoting

19 Grey v. Whitmore (1971) 17 Cal.App. 3d 1, at 20-21.)
38.
20 The California Supreme Court has long held procedural due process protections, such as
notice and a right to be heard, apply to adjudicatory land use hearings. (Horn v. County of Ventura
21 (1979) 24 Cal.3d 605, 614, 618, 621.)
22 39. CEQA grants to a person aggrieved by a CEQA determination made by the Board the
23 right to appeal that determination to the City Council, which is the public "agency's elected decision
24 making body." (PRC § 21151(c).) When a person aggrieved by the Board exercises his or her right to

25 appeal the determination to the City Council, that person comes before the City Council with a right of

26 due process of law as an administrative appellant.

27 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL
40.
28 This proceeding involves enforcement of important rights affecting the public interest.
Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a substantial benefit on the public, including
-6-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

pad citizens, residents, businesses and taxpayers of the City, and will result in the enforcement of important

2 public rights by requiring Respondents to comply with CEQA and other legal requirements applicable to

3 the proposed Project; by voiding the Project approvals and prohibiting Respondents and Real Parties in

4 Interest from taking further actions with respect to the Project until it has complied with those legal

5 requirements; and by prohibiting the Respondents from undertaking any portion of the Project until they

6 have fully complied with these legal requirements
41. Petitioners are entitled to recover attorneys' fees as provided in Code of Civil Procedure
7 | section 1021.5 if they prevail in this action. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement of these
8

9 public rights entitle Petitioner to an award of reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to that section.
STATEMENT OF FACTS

10 42. On April 1, 2015, the City Council approved a settlement agreement for Mark Willits et

11 al v. City of Los Angeles (United States District Court Case No. CVI0-05782 CBM (RZx), Pineda, el al

12 V. City of Los Angeles (Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. BC403327), Griffen, et al v. City of Los

13 Angeles (Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. BC457403), Saundra Carter et al v. City of Los Angeles

14 (Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. BC363305), and Nicole Fahmie et al v. City of Los Angeles (Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. BC381773). The Mayor of the City, Eric Garcetti, subsequently
15 approved the settlement on April 3, 2015. On August 25, 2016, the Honorable Consuelo B. Marshall of
16 the Central District of California United States District Court approved the settlement (collectively the
17

18 "Willits Settlement"). A true and correct copy of the court order approving the Willits Settlement,
including a copy of the settlement agreement, is attached as Exhibit D.

19 43. The Willits Settlement requires the City to dedicate a total of $1,367,142,684.00, over a

20 period of 30 years, approximately 31 million dollars per year, towards improving the City's pedestrian

21 facilities for disability access ("Program Access Improvements"). The Program Access Improvements

22 include repairing damages to City-owned sidewalks caused by tree roots, vertical or horizontal

23 displacement or upheaval of sidewalks greater than 1/2 an inch, as well as widening sidewalks to no less
than 4 feet.

24 44.

25 Since approval of the Willits Settlement, the City has allocated the funds required for the

26 Program Access Improvements under the Willits Settlement into the Sidewalk Repair Fund No. 57F/50

27 and utilizes funds from the Sidewalk Repair Fund No. 57F/50 to fund the Safe Sidewalks LA Program.
45. Safe Sidewalks LA offers three different programs for sidewalk repair including the

28 Access Request, Rebate and Report a Sidewalk Problem programs.
46. The Access Request program allows individuals with mobility disability to submit a
-7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- request to the City for sidewalk repairs of physical access barriers, in the public right-of-way.

2 47.

to The Rebate program allows any residential or commercial property owner within the City!

3 voluntarily undertake sidewalk repair work that meets accessibility requirements and receive a

4 financial rebate for performing the work.
48.
5 The Report a Sidewalk program allows the public to request that the City repair a
sidewalk in need of repair.
6 49.

7 On July 26, 2017, the City issued a Notice of Preparation of a Draft Environmental

8 Impact Report for the Program as well as an Initial Study / Environmental Checklist. The City

9 conducted public scoping meetings to assist preparation of the Environmental Impact Report from the
Project on August 9, 14 and 24, 2017.

10 50. The objectives of Safe Sidewalk Repair's environmental impact report include studying

I1 continuing, amending and expanding the Program while 1) complying with the Willits Settlement, and

12 amending the program, as needed, for sidewalk and curb ramp repairs in accordance with applicable

13 accessibility requirements, 2) identifying criteria for street tree preservation and removal and

14 replacement requirements where street trees are the cause of sidewalk damage and, and 3) considering

15 the City's sustainability goals when implementing the Sidewalk Repair Program.
51. In addition, the Program's environmental impact report will study development of a street
16 trees policy for sidewalk repairs, to help develop criteria for street tree preservation and removal and

17 replacement where street trees are the cause of sidewalk damage.

18 52. Petitioners have raised concerns regarding the ongoing implementation and expansion of

19 Safe Sidewalks LA while the City conducts environmental review on its effects as well as alternatives toi

20 tree removal. On February 5, 2018, Petitioners submitted public comments challenging the removal of

21 12 Indian laurel Fig trees ("Spaulding Trees") at 750 South Spaulding Avenue, Los Angeles, California

22 (File No. BPW-2018-0111) ("Spaulding Sidewalk Repair Project"), a sidewalk repair conducted under

23 the Safe Sidewalk LA program, to the Board of Public Works, which approved the Spaulding Sidewalk

24 Repair that same day after receiving public comment.
53.

25 Subsequently, on February 14, 2018, Petitioners appealed the Board of Public Work's

26 February 5, 2018 approval of the Spaulding Sidewalk Repair to City Council. As of the time of filing of
this Petition, the City Council has yet to hear the appeal of the Spaulding Sidewalk Repair.

27 54. Despite a pending administrative appeal against the Spaulding Sidewalk Repair, the City,

28 without notice to the public, proceeded with the Spaulding Sidewalk Repair Project and hus removed
the Spaulding Trees. On or about April 27, 2018, Petitioners discovered that the 12 Indian Laurel Fig

6 to due process and a fair hearing before the City Council on Petitioners' appeal of the Spaulding
Sidewalk Repair Project.
66.

8 The actions of the City violated Petitioners' due process rights and subjected Petitioners
as administrative appellants with hearing rights, to a fundamentally unfair process. This included 9 cutting off Petitioners' right to be heard- namely the right to testify and present evidence on their appeal

10 to the decisionmaking body (the City Council) prior to the execution of the permit being appealed.

1i 67. The City's actions subverted due process by providing Petitioner and other speakers in

12 opposition to the Project no opportunity to present their objections before the City Council
68.
13 The City's actions demonstrate that an appellant who appeals a determination on a tree

14 removal permit under the SRP, or a person a who objects to the SRP prior to the required final CEQA

15 review, is not afforded an opportunity to be heard prior to the execution of the tree removal permits
during the pendency of an appeal to the City Council.
16 69.

17 The City continues to violate the due process rights of administrative appellants by

18 engaging in a pattern and practice of approving and carrying out various individual Access
Improvements despite pending appeals to City Council.

19 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

20 70. (Injunction to prevent illegal expenditure of funds)

21 herein. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate all the above paragraphs as if fully set forth

22 71.
23 California Code of Civil Procedure section 526a prohibits the illegal expenditure of

2.4 taxpayer funds. Respondents have expended, and, unless enjoined, will continue to expend taxpayer

25 funds to illegally perform Sidewalk Repairs and associated tree removals under the Safe Sidewalks LA
Program.

26 72.

27 Petitioners request, therefore, that this court enjoin Respondents from approving
Sidewalk Repairs in violation of CEQA.
