Writ Petition

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. This action challenges approvals by Respondent City of San Diego ("City" or
"Respondent") of the Hillcrest 111 project (Project") and the related approval of a Mitigated Negative
Declaration ("MND").
2. The City violated the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Pub. Res. Code
21000, et seq., in several respects. Among other things, the City failed to adequately consider the

7 environmental impacts associated with the Project, failed to prepare and circulate required
8 environmental analysis, and failed to consider feasible alternatives and mitigation. The Project also
violates and is inconsistent with the General Plan, Climate Action Plan, Community Plan, and

10 Municipal Code.

11 3. Petitioner seeks alternative and peremptory writs of mandate declaring the City's approvals

12 invalid, and enjoining the City from taking steps to implement the approvals.

13 PARTIES

14 4. Petitioner Uptown United is an unincorporated association of residents and property owners

15 within the City of San Diego who seek to maintain the unique character of the neighborhood, preserve

16 aesthetic qualities, enhance pedestrian and traffic safety, and otherwise protect the community and
17 environment. Uptown United members are concerned that the proposed Project will have a significant

18 negative impact on the environment and quality of life in the area. Petitioner and its members have been

19 injured as a result of Respondent's actions. Petitioner and its members use, enjoy and benefit from the

20 resources affected by Respondent's actions. Respondent's actions adversely affect the recreational,

21 vocational, aesthetic, scientific, environmental and economic interests of Petitioner and of Petitioner's

22 members. The interests of Petitioner and Petitioner's members have been and will continue to be

23 adversely affected by Respondent's unlawful actions. The relief sought in this Petition would redress

24 Petitioner's and Petitioner's members' injuries.

25 5. Respondent City of San Diego is a political subdivision of the State of California and the

26 County of San Diego and a body corporate and politic exercising local government powers, as specified

27 by the Constitution and the laws of the State of California.

3 Petition to set forth the names and capacities of said respondents along with appropriate charging

4 allegations when the same have been ascertained.

5 7. Real Parties in Interest Greystar UTC, LLC, Greystar GP II, LLC, Greystar Real Estate

6 Partners, LLC, and Pacific Bell Telephone Company are the Project applicants, Project site owners and/or

7 recipients of Project approval.

12 PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND HISTORY

13 9. The Project site is approximately 42,000 square feet located at 635 Robinson Avenue in

14 San Diego.

15 10. The Project proposes to develop the site into 111 multi-family residential units and 4,800

16 square feet of commercial retail space within a 136,816 square-foot, seven story building. The Project

17 will also include three levels of underground parking and a detached subterranean parking structure.

18 The applicant sought a Neighborhood Development Permit (No. 1832841).

19 11. The City prepared the MND regarding the Project. The MND was circulated for public

20 comment between December 22, 2017 and January 16, 2018. The MND concluded that there would

21 not be any significant impact associated with approval and implementation of the Project. Comment

22 letters were submitted, including from Petitioner, objecting to the MND.

23 12. Subsequent to circulation of the MND, numerous comments were received by the City

24 regarding the Project and MND, including from area residents and Petitioner. The comments noted

25 several problems with the City's analysis and its failure to prepare an Environmental Impact Report

26 ("EIR"), including, but not limited to, that the Project would lead to aesthetic and land use impacts,

27 that the Project would build in a manner inconsistent with the applicable Community Plan, that the

28 Project would lead to significant growth-inducing and cumulative impacts, that the Project would lead

Uptown United v. City of San Diego Page 3
Writ Petition

1 to significant impacts associated with light and shadow, that the Project would lead to significant

2 impacts to cultural resources, that the Project would lead to significant air quality impacts, that the

3 Project would lead to significant impacts to soils and geology, that the Project would lead to significant
impacts to greenhouse gas emissions, that the Project would lead to significant noise impacts, that the
5 Project will lead to significant impacts to public services, that the Project will lead to significant water

6 supply impacts, that the traffic analysis did not account for all likely traffic, that the traffic analysis did

7 not realistically consider existing poor circulation conditions, that the Project will lead to significant

8 traffic impacts, that the Project would lead to significant impacts to traffic, pedestrian and bicycle
safety, that the Project would lead to significant impacts to historic resources, that the Project did not

10 propose to mitigate all of its impacts, that the Project would lead to significant parking impacts, that

11 the loss of street parking would lead to other impacts (including but not limited to traffic, noise, and air
12 quality impacts), that the Project would exacerbate existing bad conditions, that the Project is

13 inconsistent with community character, that the Project would lead to significant impacts to recreation,

14 and that the Project poses cumulative impacts.

15 13. Petitioner and others expressed concerns the City was improperly segmenting the Project's

16 impacts, which would be caused during all phases, including construction and operation.

17 14. Despite these concerns, City staff issued approval of the Neighborhood Development

18 Permit and MND on March 7, 2018.

19 15. Petitioner filed timely appeals of both decisions. Despite CEQA's requirement that

20 permitting and its impacts should be considered simultaneously, the City required separate hearings on

21 the Permit and the MND.

22 16. On April 23, 2018, the City Council met to consider the MND. City staff warned the City

23 Council it could not consider the Permit, only the MND. Numerous comments were received, orally

24 and in writing, in opposition to the Project and MND, including comments from Petitioner's

25 representatives. After receiving public testimony, the City Council approved the MND.

26 17. On May 31, 2018, the City's Planning Commission held a hearing regarding the Permit. a

27 City staff warned the Planning Commission it could not consider the MND, only the Permit.

28 Numerous comments were received, orally and in writing, in opposition to the Project and MND,

Uptown United v. City of San Diego Page 4
Writ Petition

1 including comments from Petitioner's representatives. The Planning Commission voted to approve the

2 Permit.

3 18. A Notice of Determination was filed by the City on June 1, 2018.

4 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

5 AND INADEQUATE REMEDIES AT LAW

6 19. Petitioner has exhausted all available administrative remedies, and objections to the Project

7 have been presented orally and in writing to the City, as required by Public Resources Code Section

8 21177. These include, but are not limited to, letters and oral comments presented during public

9 hearings.

10 20. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code Section 21167.5

11 by mailing a written notice of commencement of this action to the City. A true and correct copy of

12 that notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.

13 21. Petitioner has advised the City that Petitioner has elected to prepare the record of

14 proceedings relevant to the approval of the Project, pursuant to Public Resources Code Section
15 21167.6. A true and correct copy of that notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.

16 22. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code Section 21167.7 by filing a copy of

17 the original petition with the California Attorney General. A true and correct copy of the notification

18 is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.

19 23. Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law unless the Court grants the requested writ of

20 mandate requiring the City to set aside its approval of the Project and the FEIR. In the absence of such

21 remedy, the City's approvals will remain in effect in violation of State law, and Petitioner will suffer
