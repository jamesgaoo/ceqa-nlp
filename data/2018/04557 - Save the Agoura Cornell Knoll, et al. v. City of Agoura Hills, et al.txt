FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

H Petitioners, Save the Agoura Cornell Knoll and California Native Plant Society,

2 allege:
3 Introduction
4

LO0N0 1. By this action, Petitioners, Save the Agoura Cornell Knoll and California Native
Plant Society, challenge the unlawful actions of the City of Agoura Hills, its
Planning Commission, and its City Council, (collectively, the City) in approving
land-use entitlements for the Cornerstone Mixed-Use Project (the Project), a
mixed-use residential-commercial project with 35 dwelling units and 68,918
10 square feet of commercial space located at the southeast corner of the

11 intersection of Agoura Road and Cornell Road in the City of Agoura Hills,

12 County of Los Angeles (the Project Site).

13 2. The Project will destroy habitat for rare native plants, hinder visual beauty for
14 which Agoura Hills is known, prevent the establishment of approved recreational
15 amenities, increase already-frustrating traffic on roads in the Project area,
16 including Kanan Road and Agoura Road, and damage the already-fragile water
17 quality of the Malibu Creek watershed. Its dense and auto-centric design will
18 require mass grading, flattening of a treasured knoll, and removal or
19 encroachment into the protected zones of up to 59 coast live oak and valley oak
8 3 trees and removal of 21,271 square feet of scrub oak habitat, all of which conflict
with the Agoura Hills General Plan (General Plan), the Agoura Village Specific 22 Plan (Specific Plan), and the City's oak tree ordinance.
23
24 3. The significant environmental impacts listed in the previous paragraph cannot be

25 mitigated with a redesign of the Project, and will not be mitigated into

26 insignificance by the mitigation measures listed in the Mitigated Negative

27 Declaration. CEQA therefore requires the City to prepare an Environmental

28 Impact Report for the Project.

29 Parties
30
31 4. Petitioner Save the Agoura Cornell Knoll (STACK) is an unincorporated
association whose members include individuals residing and working in the 32

33 vicinity of the Project, and individuals concerned about the urban built

34 environment in the City of Agoura Hills and neighboring communities. STACK
brings this action on behalf of the public. Members of STACK have beneficial 35

TOoNamAW- interest in this case because the actions being taken by the City, and challenged in
this case, affect them directly as neighbors of the Project and members of the
public at large.
5. Petitioner California Native Plant Society (CNPS) is a California nonprofit
corporation whose principle place of business is in Sacramento, California. CNPS
is a statewide organization of nearly 10,000 members, including both professional
botanists and laypersons, dedicated to the preservation of California's rich
botanical heritage. The mission of CNPS is to increase the understanding and
appreciation of California's native plants and to preserve them in their natural

11 habitat through scientific activities, education, and conservation. CNPS members

12 work closely with federal and state agency personnel to manage and conserve

13 botanical resources. CNPS is particularly concerned with the conservation of

14 California's rare and endemic plant species and threatened plant communities.

15 CNPS members are engaged in the study, protection, enhancement,

16 conservation, and preservation of rare and endangered plants in their natural

17 habitat in California, including in Los Angeles and Ventura counties.

18
19 6. Respondent City of Agoura Hills (City) is a municipal corporation. The Agoura

20 Hills City Council (City Council) is the City's legislative body. The Agoura Hills

21 Planning Commission (Planning Commission) is a unit of City government

22 having jurisdiction over certain land-use approvals within the City.

23 7. Respondents Doron Gelfand and Agoura and Cornell Roads, LP are, on

24 information and belief, the legal and equitable owners of the Project Site and the

25 Applicants for the entitlements being challenged in this case (Applicant).

26

27 8. Petitioners are currently unaware of the true names and capacities of respondents

28 and defendants Does 1 through 10, and therefore sues those parties by such

29 fictitious names. Does 1 through 10 are agents of the Respondent Applicant who

30 are responsible in some manner for the conduct described in this petition, or

31 other persons or entities who claim some legal or equitable interest in the subject

32 matter of this action. Petitioners will amend this petition to show the true
and capacities of Does 1 through 10 when such names and names

33 known. capacities become

Jurisdiction and Venue

2 9. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this petition under Code
3 of Civil Procedure (CCP) $$1085 and 1094.5, Pub. Res. Code $ 21167 and Gov.
4 Code $ 65009.

5

6 10. This case is properly classified as an unlimited civil case, and therefore within the

7 jurisdiction of this Court, because it is not one of the types of cases listed as
limited civil cases in CCP SS 86, 86.1 or 87.
8

9 11. Venue is proper in this Court under CCP $ 394 because the Respondent City of
10 Agoura Hills is a local agency with territory wholly within Los Angeles County,
11 which is where the Project's environmental effects will be felt.
12
13 12. Petitioners have performed all conditions precedent to filing this action,
of all administrative remedies available to them.
14 including exhaustion

15 The Project
16 13. The Project at issue in this case is the proposed construction of a mixed-use
17 development known as the Cornerstone Project with 35 dwelling units and 18 68,918 square feet of commercial space located at the intersection of Agoura
19 Road and Cornell Road in the City of Agoura Hills. The Project would replace
20 open space on an undeveloped knoll, currently vegetated with native sage scrub 21 and coastal oak woodlands, with 116,776 square feet of apartment, commercial,
22 retail, and office development, distributed among seven two- and three-story
23 buildings up to 45 feet tall. Over 100,000 square feet of parking would be
24 constructed.
25
26 14. Located at the southeast corner of Cornell Road and Agoura Road, the 8.11-acre
27 Project Site is situated in the northern foothills of the Santa Monica Mountains
28 and features steep slopes of up to 4:1 and elevations ranging from 800 to 1,050
29 feet. 95,000 cubic yards of cut and 6 months of grading would occur, requiring
30 nearly 6,000 one-way heavy truck trips, or 90 one-way truck trips per day.

31 15. The Project-Site slopes are very steep, steep enough to require the construction of
32 6-foot-tall retaining walls.

2 16. The Project Site is located at the edge of the Agoura Hills City limits, bordering a

3 County-designated significant ecological area (SEA) that included the Project site
itself prior to City annexation.
4

100 y a 17. There are 59 coast live oak and valley oak trees on the Project Site. Up to all 59
would be impacted. Twenty-nine are slated for removal. The Project would
encroach into the protected zones of at least 6 and as many as all 30 of the
remaining trees.

10 18. The Project Site contains 61,845 square feet of scrub oak tree habitat, 21,271

11 square feet of which would be removed as part of the Project.

12 19. The Project Site is designated in the General Plan and City zoning as Open Space

13 Restricted (OS-R) and Planned Development - Agoura Village Specific Plan.

14

15 20. The Applicant sought, and the City has approved, the following discretionary

16 entitlements (the Project Entitlements) in Case No. 07-AVDP-002:

17 a. Tentative Parcel Map No. 70559, subdividing the Project Site into two

18 parcels;

19 b. Development Permit No. 07AVDP-002;

20 C.
21 Conditional use permit for hillside development;

22

23 d. Oak Tree Permit to remove 29 oak trees and 21,271 square feet of scrub

24 oak habitat, and to encroach within the protected zone of 6 oak trees.

25 21. In connection with the Project, the City has adopted an Initial Study (IS), a

26 Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND), and Mitigation Monitoring and

27 Reporting Program (MMRP) for the Project, under the California Environmental

28 Quality Act, Pub. Res. Code. $$ 21000-21189.3 (collectively, the CEQA

29 Approvals).

30

31 Approval Process

32 22. On January 5, 2017, the Planning Commission approved the Project Entitlements

33 and adopted the CEQA Approvals.

2 23. On January 19, 2017, CNPS filed an Appeal Application, appealing the Planning
Commission's approvals to the City Council.
w
4 24. On March 8, 2017, the City Council denied the appeal, approved the Project

5 Entitlements, and adopted the CEQA Approvals.

6 First Cause of Action

7 Violation of CEQA

8
9 25. Petitioners incorporate 55 1-24 as though set forth here.

10 26. In approving the MND, the City violated the California Environmental Quality

11 Act, Public Resources Code §$ 21000-21189.3 (CEQA) and the CEQA

12 Guidelines (14 Cal. Code Regs. $S 15000-15387 plus appendices) in significant

13 ways, some of which are described in the following paragraphs.

14
15 27. The City of Agoura Hills has failed to prepare a legally adequate Initial Study and

16 Mitigated Negative Declaration because those documents do not adequately

17 describe the Project and its environmental impacts. In particular, the IS/MND
fails to even
18 consider impacts related to land use/planning and recreation.

19 28. The City has also failed to disclose, analyze, and mitigate the Project's significant
8388 adverse environmental impacts in multiple areas, including aesthetic, cultural,
biological, land use, recreational, geologic, traffic/air quality, greenhouse gas, and
water quality impacts, as well as the cumulative impacts caused by allowing
exceptions and increases in density beyond the limits of the Agoura Village
Specific Plan.

25

26 29. The IS/MND fails to respond adequately to comments submitted by the

27 Petitioners, other members of the public, and other agencies. Instead, the

28 responses given to numerous comments regarding the Project's impacts are

29 conclusory or non-responsive, contrary to the requirements of CEQA. The

30 IS/MND fails to adequately respond to evidence submitted by commenters

31 showing that some environmental impacts of the Project are significant.

32 30. Where mitigation measures are included, they are vague, deferred, or inadequate

33 to truly mitigate the Project's impacts. An EIR is required before the Project may

34 be lawfully approved.

TooJamAUU- Aesthetic Impacts
31. The conversion of a scenic knoll into seven 3-story buildings, along with the
removal of 29 coastal live oak and valley oak trees and 95,000 cubic yards of
grading will cause significant adverse impacts to the visual quality of the site.
Most of the Project's visual impacts were not analyzed in the Specific Plan, so the
Project's CEQA documentation must fully analyze those impacts, but fails to do
so.

32. Agoura Road in the Project area is a valuable scenic resource in Agoura Hills that

11 provides scenic views of the Santa Monica Mountains and natural steep foothills

12 with protected oak trees. It is a semi-rural two-lane road that serves as a regional
bicycle route, provides opportunities for the public to take advantage of the

13 aesthetic value of the natural environment, and embodies the rural character of

14
15 this area of the city. The Project will have a significant impact on Agoura Road's

16 a character as a scenic roadway, as it will negatively affect the views from the
roadway-replacing them with views of building walls and sidewalks--and

17
18 includes grading and removal of substantial part of the knoll and removal of
protected and valued oak trees and native plant habitat. Further, although the

19

20 General Plan and Specific Plan provide that Agoura Road is to remain a two-lane
road, the Project's growth inducement may lead to increased traffic pressure to

21

22 change Agoura Road from scenic two-lane roadway to an urban collector street,

23 also leading to the loss of the bicycle lanes that allow Agoura Road to serve as a
regional bicycle route

24

25 33. The Project's aesthetic impacts are significant, and cannot be mitigated into

26 insignificance without a redesign, so the City must prepare an EIR for the Project.

27 Biological Resources

28

29 34. The Project Site is ecologically significant and was designated as such by the

30 County of Los Angeles. While the County's SEA determination does not apply

31 now that the land is located in the City of Agoura Hills, the site's important

32 biological resources remain. The 8.2-acre Project Site comprises some of the most

33 visually and botanically sensitive land in the City of Agoura Hills. There probably

34 is no more botanically rich equivalent-sized property within the City boundary.

35 One hundred native plant species, two federally listed plant species, multiple

- 6 -

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

FN0 t n plant species of concern, rare plant communities, and scores of oak trees make up
an ecologically unique site. The grading for the proposed project would eliminate
a minimum of 6.25 acres of this vegetation and its substrate. The permanent
future fuel modification would adversely affect all of the remaining 1.96 acres to
varying degrees. These are significant impacts that must be analyzed in an EIR.

7 35. The Project site and adjacent environs host ten special or protected plant

\O 00 populations. The Project would remove at least 63 percent of the 142 Agoura
Hills dudleya individuals, even though it is a federally threatened species. Lyon's

10 pentachaeta is listed as endangered on both the state and federal endangered

11 species lists, but the Project would remove all individuals documented on-site.

12 Also present is the Ojai navarretia, considered "[s]eriously endangered in

13 California" under the criteria used by the California Department of Fish and

14 Wildlife (CDFW) to assess plant species significance. Since the plants involved

15 are so rare, the loss of any of these populations presents a significant adverse

Ecosa impact on biological resources that requires preparation of an EIR.
36. The MND also fails to consider the Project's fuel-modification zone in its analysis
of the Project's impacts on rare and endangered plant species. Fuel-modification
zones for the Project will extend hundreds of feet from the buildings.

21 Accordingly, the Project's true impact on these species has not likely been

22 disclosed. Thus, without disclosure and analysis, this impact cannot have been

23 adequately mitigated, such that use of an MND is appropriate.

24 37. 59 coast live oak and valley oak trees grow on the Project site. The Project would

25 affect up to all of these oaks, removing 29 of them and permitting encroachment

26 into the protected zone for between 6 and all 30 of the remaining trees. The

27 encroachment into the root zones and driplines of these trees severely reduces the

28 likelihood that they will survive construction of the Project. It is not "saving them

29 in place" as claimed by the MND. Additionally, the City permits the removal of

30 up to 20 percent of the canopy and root zones of protected oak trees. (Agoura

31 Hills Municipal Code $ 9657.5.) The removal and/or slow death of up to 59 oak

32 trees is a significant adverse impact on biological resources that is not adequately

33 mitigated in the MND. An EIR is required to analyze alternatives to the Project

34 that will retain far more of the site's oak woodland.

35

1
2 38. As part of the Project, approximately 21,271 square feet of scrub oak habitat will

Eoovansw be removed. Scrub oak trees are considered a valuable natural resource by the
CDFW and are protected by the City's oak tree ordinance. The site contains
61,845 square feet of scrub oak habitat; thus, the Project involves removing nearly
35% of that habitat. The removal of such a large portion of the scrub oak habitat
is a significant adverse impact on biological resources that is not adequately analyzed or mitigated in the MND. An EIR is required to analyze alternatives to
the Project that will retain far more of the site's scrub oak habitat.

39. The Project is located within a significant documented wildlife corridor that

11 extends from the coast through the Kanan watershed, Oak Park, Simi Hills,

12 Angeles, and Los Padres National Forests to the Temblor and Tehachapi Ranges.

13 The MND does not consider the ecological effects of the Project on the corridor.

14 These effects are potentially significant, and must be analyzed in an EIR.

15

16 40. Despite the Project site's importance as a repository of rare plant species that

17 would be eliminated by Project construction, the IS/MND determines that

18 impacts to biological resources can be fully mitigated and are therefore

19 insignificant. But the mitigation measures the MND relies upon are vague,

20 deferred, or ineffective, and will not ensure the propagation of rare plant species

21 or the continuation of oak woodlands that would be required for the Project's

22 impacts to remain at a level a below significance. Examples of vague, deferred, or

23 ineffective mitigation measures are given in the following paragraphs.

24 41. CS-BIO-1 claims that the Applicant will "offset the loss of individual Lyon's

25 pentachaeta and Agoura Hills dudleya plants through onsite restoration (salvage

26 and replanting), offsite preservation, offsite enhancement, or another method

27 approved by the City…in consultation with CDFW and USFWS." This

28 mitigation measure is vague and ineffective. First, CDFW advises against the

29 transplantation and creation of offsite habitat for rare plant species because it is

30 ineffective and far inferior to retaining individuals and populations that already

31 exist. Thus, none of these nonspecific methods will offset any individuals lost to

32 development. Second, the measure does not require the concurrence or

33 agreement with CDFW or USFWS, just undefined "consultation." Moreover, the

34 measure specifically provides that avoidance is not necessary if it would "not be

35 feasible or would compromise the objectives of the Specific Plan." But this

- 8 -

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

determination would be made after Project approval, and out of the public eye.

2 Based on the failure to retain a majority of the site's 59 coast live oak and valley

3 oak trees without encroachment, it is already clear that the City and the

4 Applicant view any project modifications or revisions to preserve biological

5 resources as infeasible. CS-BIO-1 then provides for the preparation of a

6 restoration plan that will identify the number of plants to be planted and the

7 methods that will be used for preservation. While the formulation of specific
8 be deferred if performance standards are details of mitigation measures may

9 adopted with Project approval, this measure specifies the adoption of future

10 performance standards. Thus, the MND relies on a future plan that will have to

11 meet goals that will not be established prior to Project approval. This deprives the
12 public and decision makers of the ability to evaluate the effectiveness of
13 mitigation measures before Project approval, in violation of CEQA. Even with
14 this mitigation measure, any rare plant individuals found within the development

15 fuel modification zones will be removed. The adverse impacts of footprint or

16 eliminating these populations and of eliminating populations of species on the

17 verge of extinction would remain. An EIR is required.

18 42. CS-BIO-2 discusses the future development of protocols to protect rare plant
19 species identified in fuel modification zones, but there is no reason that this
20 protocol cannot be developed now and included in the MND and MMRP.
21 Deferral of mitigation is not permitted when it can be developed prior to Project 22 approval.
23
24 43. CS-BIO-3, permits the destruction of 244 Ojai navarretia plants so long as a

25 restoration plan is prepared in the future. Years of studies demonstrate that

26 restoration is far inferior to preservation. This mitigation measure is both

27 impermissibly deferred and likely ineffective. It will not mitigate the loss of the
28 244 individual plants.

29 44. CS-BIO-9 requires the replacement of four oak trees for every one tree removed,
30 but permits payment of an in-lieu fee instead of replacement of the 29 trees that
31 will be removed if space is not available for replanting. It also requires that to 32 mitigate the removal of 21,271 sq. ft. of scrub oak habitat, the plan will include at
33 least 213 5-gallon scrub oak trees planted at 10 ft. on-center These measures do
34 not mitigate the loss of oak woodlands on the site and will result in a net loss of 35

DOONOAWD- oak trees in Agoura Hills. Even if trees are replanted onsite or offsite, grading and
drainage alterations to the site will reduce the ability of replanted oak trees to
survive and thrive. Attempts to re-create oak woodlands as mitigation for other
developments are often unsuccessful.
45. CS-BIO-10 requires the Applicant to submit the results of an oak tree survey and
an Oak Tree Report including an Oak Tree Preservation Program, and sets forth
several components that the program must include, such as that grading,

10 development, and construction activities shall not take place within 5 or 6 feet

11 from the driplines of "specimen oak trees." The mitigation measure is improperly
deferred in that it relies on the results of an oak tree survey and Oak Tree Report

12 with Oak Tree Preservation Program that have not yet been developed. Further,

13 there is no substantial evidence in the record that the required components of the

14 preservation program will be sufficient to mitigate the environmental impact on

15 oak trees and habitat to insignificance. For example, components limiting

16 activities within 5 or 6 feet from oak tree driplines may encroach within 15 feet of

17 the trunk of some trees, encroaching on the tree's protected zone.

18

19 46. Much of the Project's most severe vegetation impact could be avoided by

20 reducing the project footprint. The MND contains no analysis of alternatives that

21 might significantly reduce the Project's impact on biological resources. An EIR

22 must be prepared so that the City can consider a reasonable range of alternatives

23 that might reduce the Project's significant impacts on biological resources.

24 Recreational Resources

25

26 47. The Agoura Village Specific Plan and the 2008 Regional Trails Plan depict the

27 Zuma Ridge Trail/Rim of the Valley Trail's path as extending from Agoura Road

28 along the east side of Cornell Road to an equestrian center. Thus, the Zuma Ridge

29 Trail must pass through the Project Site. But the Project includes several three-

30 story buildings and widened streets that will prevent extension of this hiking and

31 equestrian trail and construction of the equestrian center. This inconsistency
with adopted City plans is an

32 adverse land use impact, as well as an adverse

33 impact on recreation that must be disclosed, analyzed, and mitigated in an EIR.

34 By removing a scenic knoll and numerous oak trees in favor or dense, urban

35 development and by replacing the rural, two-lane road with a wider, suburban

10 -

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- road with wide sidewalks and ample parking, the Project will affect the aesthetic

2 quality and recreational value of the Zuma Ridge Trail and other nearby trails
3 that view the Project site. The MND fails to assess this potentially significant

4 impact.

5 48. The Rim of the Valley Trail Corridor Master Plan includes a spur from the Rim
6
N 00 / of the Valley Trail leading from Cheeseboro Canyon across the 101 freeway and along the south side of Agoura Road to the project site by the Cornell Road
intersection. The MND is deficient for not addressing the existence of this
planned spur trail and potential adverse impacts to the unofficial City trail along
10 Chesebro Creek and Agoura Road.
11

12 49. The National Park Service has planned a trail, the Agoura Equestrian Center

13 Connector, coming from Cheeseboro Canyon and then along the north side of

14 Agoura Road (Zuma Ridge Trail), up a short stretch of Cornell Road and then up

15 to the paper street through the proposed development (Paramount Ranch

16 Connector Trail). The MND is deficient for not addressing the existence of this

17 planned trail, which has been part of the NPS Trails Plan since at least 2004.
18 Land Use
19

20 50. As alleged below, the Project is inconsistent with the General Plan and Specific

21 Plan, but the IS and MND do not discuss these inconsistencies. CEQA requires

22 any inconsistencies between proposed project and applicable land use plans to

23 be discussed in Project's environmental documentation. A Project's

24 inconsistencies with local plans and policies constitute significant impacts under

25 CEQA, which, in this case, require an EIR to be prepared.

26 51. The Project will induce more growth, by providing a high-quality, full-service,
27 moderate-grade road to dozens of ridgeline and sub-ridgeline parcels located
28 directly to the south and east. The MND should have analyzed how the Project
29 would accelerate the development of small lots served by this road, such as by
30 providing utility services and drainage options to these lots.
31
32 52. The IS/MND concludes, with no discussion, that "because there would be no

33 significant impacts, no mitigation measures are required." An IS is required to

34 support findings such as the finding of no significant land-use impacts, with

35

- 11 -

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION.FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

some substantial evidence and reasoned discussion. The lack of any basis for the

2 conclusion that the Project will have no significant land-use effects violates
CEQA and is sufficient ground for setting aside the IS/MND.

4

5 Water Quality

6 53. The Project will replace natural soil surfaces with impervious surfaces that

7 prevent water from percolating into the ground, promoting runoff. Runoff of

8 impervious surfaces in urban areas contains toxic materials such as oil and other

9 chemicals, as well as sediments that increase turbidity of downstream waters and

10 harm wildlife. The IS and MND fail to analyze the potentially significant effects

11 of the increased toxic runoff on water quality.

12 54. The CEQA analysis of water quality impacts in the IS/MND relies on outdated
13 water quality standards and requirements, resulting in a failure to include
14 mitigation measures adequate to eliminate the Project's true impacts on water
15 quality. For example, the MND relies on a "Conceptual SUSMP" to fully mitigate
16 the Project's operational impacts on water quality. However, the "Conceptual
17 SUSMP" does not acknowledge revised water quality standards established by the
18 Environmental Protection Agency for the Malibu Creek watershed in 2012, or
19 that California issued a new permit for pollutant discharges from urban sources
20 to the Malibu Creek watershed in 2012. The "Conceptual SUSMP" also fails to
21 discuss the City's responsibilities under the Municipal Separate Storm Sewer
22 System permit that implements these 2012 water quality standards for the Malibu
23 Creek watershed. The IS/MND contains no specific mitigation or reporting
24 requirements designed to comply with these applicable regulations. Thus, the
25 record does not contain substantial evidence in support of the IS/MND's
26 conclusion that significant impacts will not occur. On the contrary, the Project's
27 impacts on water quality will remain significant, and preparation of an EIR is
28 required.
29

30 Traffic

31 55. Based on traffic counts taken exclusively in October and March 2013, the MND
32 finds that the Project's peak hour trips will not cause significant traffic impacts.
33 is The traffic study is out of date and inaccurate, and the conclusion is not
34 supported by substantial evidence. For example, in summer months, four-lane
35

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- Kanan Road provides the safest and most direct access to Zuma Beach for San

2 Fernando Valley residents. Zuma Beach receives in excess of six million visitors

3 each year. This results in extreme traffic congestion in which it may take 10

4 minutes for a car to travel 100 feet. And traffic in the area is already congested

5 both during and outside peak hours throughout the year, including gridlock at

6 the intersection of Kanan Road and Roadside Drive and the intersection of

7 Kanan Road and Agoura Road. The Project's additional 3,035 trips per day

8 should have been analyzed for its environmental impacts, including cumulative

9 impacts.

10 56. Congestion, such as that experienced on Kanan Road throughout the year, but
11 especially in the summer, also increases tailpipe emissions such as carbon 12 monoxide that can become dangerous when concentrated by stopped traffic.
13 These conditions will be exacerbated by the Project, but are not disclosed,
14
15 analyzed, or mitigated in the MND. The existence of this potentially significant
environmental impact must be analyzed in an EIR.
16
17 57. The IS/MND concluded the Project would increase traffic at the US-101

18 Southbound/Roadside Drive/Kanan Road intersection, a significant impact, but

19 concluded that impacts would be less than significant with mitigation. The
20 mitigation measures relied on are ineffective. Traffic would remain congested
388 after proposed mitigation measures are put into place. Additionally, the
mitigation measures are not feasible, as they will result in other adverse

24 environmental effects, for example the loss of a pedestrian sidewalk, safety
impacts, the need to widen other roadways and a small bridge, and the need to
25 add additional turn lanes on the roadways.

26 58. According to the IS/MND, during grading and excavation, approximately 5,782
27 round-trip truckloads would be needed to export 92,500 cubic yards of earth
28 materials off-site. This export process is estimated to take 6 months, resulting in
29 an average of 45 round-trip truck trips per day. Traffic impacts from these truck
30 trips were not disclosed, analyzed, or mitigated in the MND. This potentially
31 significant environmental impact must be analyzed in an EIR.
32

33 59. The Project would modify Agoura Road near the location of the Project Site,

34 including adding sidewalks, improving curbs and gutters, and adding on-street

U bicycle lanes and angled parking on the south side of the street. The Agoura Hills

4 General Plan 2035 EIR's traffic volume projections concluded that Agoura Road

5 east of Cornell Road would be at LOS-D, below the minimum acceptable level of

6 service criteria established in the General Plan. Given the Project's additional

7 3.035 trips per day, the IS/MND failed to analyze the likelihood that the Project

co will increase congestion to such a level that Agoura Road will need to be widened

9 to a 3- or 4-lane road, including eliminating its bicycle lanes.

Tribal Cultural Resources

10

11
12 60. The City determined that Archaeological Site CA-LAN-1352 meets the criteria

13 for inclusion on the California Register of Historic Resources, so it is a historic

14 resource, as defined in CEQA Guidelines $ 15064.5(a), as well as a CEQA
archaeological resource.

15
16 61. The MND therefore erred by finding, with no supporting evidence, that the

17
18 Project would not cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of CA-
LAN-1352 when, in fact, it would destroy this historical resource. This is a

19 significant effect under CEQA that requires the preparation of an EIR.

20

21 62. There is no substantial evidence in the record that Mitigation Measure CS-CR-3,

22 which requires a Phase III data recovery excavation program if avoidance of CA-

23 LAN-1352 is not possible, will be sufficient to mitigate the Project's destruction
of CA-LAN-1352 to a level where it is not significant.

24

25
26 63. The City failed to provide notice to California Native American tribes as required

concerning the Project.

27 by Pub. Res. Code § 21080.3.1(d) so that such tribes could consult with the City

28

29 64. The IS/MND determined that the Project may have significant impacts on an

30 identified tribal cultural resource, but failed to determine whether that impact is

or

31 significant, and whether feasible alternatives or mitigation measures could avoid

32 substantially lessen the impact, as required by Pub. Res. Code , 21082.3(b).

33 The IS/MND's failure to include this information violates CEQA.

Geology and Soils

34

35 65. The IS/MND purports to identify all faults in the region of the Project Site and
concludes that with mitigation, no significant effects exist as a result of potential

- 14 -

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- rupture of a known earthquake fault. The IS/MND fails to identify all faults in the
2 area surrounding Agoura Hills, for example the Liberty Canyon fault. The
3 conclusion of the IS/MND is not supported by substantial evidence. An EIR is

4 necessary to analyze potential substantial adverse effects related to all known

5 faults.

6 Greenhouse Gases
7

8 66. The City's adoption of the greenhouse-gas (GHG) significance threshold of 3,000

9 metric tons CO,E per year is not supported by substantial evidence.

10 67. The GHG mitigation measure "Implement employee trip reduction program to
11 achieve an eight percent reduction in vehicle trips" is highly questionable, and
12 not supported by substantial evidence. It seems unlikely that a sufficient
13 percentage of the trips made in connection with the Project would be made by
14 employees of businesses operating on the Project Site that such a program could
15 result in an overall 8% reduction in trips.
16
17 Improper Piecemealing

18 68. The IS/MND fails to identify truck routes to be used for hauling and other
19 activities during construction, grading, excavation, and removal of earth material
20 5888 from the Project Site. To the extent the City or Applicant intends to identify and
analyze the effects of such truck routes at a later time, doing so constitutes
improper piecemealing of the environmental analysis.

25 Second Cause of Action
26 Violation of Planning and Zoning Law - Approval of Project Inconsistent with
27 the Applicable General Plan and Specific Plan
28 69. Petitioners incorporate 99 1-24 as though set forth here.
29
30 70. The Project Site is located in the City of Agoura Hills. It is within the territory of

31 the Agoura Village Specific Plan and the Agoura Hills General Plan.

32 71. The Planning and Zoning Law, Gov. Code $$ 65000-66499.58, requires the City
33 to approve development projects only when they are consistent with the
34 applicable land-use plans. The City violated the Planning and Zoning Law in

CONOAWD- approving the Project because it is inconsistent with the Specific Plan and
General Plan for the reasons set forth in the following paragraphs.
72. The Project is inconsistent with the Mobility Element of the 2010 General Plan
Update. The General Plan describes Agoura Road east of Cornell as a "semi-
rural" two-lane road without street lights. While the General Plan anticipates
widening Agoura Road west of Kanan, it does not discuss, and its EIR does not
analyze, widening east of Kanan. But the Project would double the width of the

10 sidewalks provided and install angled parking and streetlights, likely in an effort
to establish a right-of-way for a 4-lane Agoura Road. The General Plan also

11 designates Agoura Road east of Kanan as a "valuable scenic resource in the

12 community that [provides] scenic views of the Santa Monica Mountains,

13 including Ladyface Mountain." The General Plan seeks to protect the views of the

14 Santa Monica Mountains and Agoura Hills' position as "Gateway to the Santa

15 Monica Mountains National Recreation Area" by restricting street lighting,

16 requiring setbacks from the road to preserve hillside vistas, and requiring

17 preservation of oak trees near roadway segments designated as "valuable scenic

18 resources. The Project is inconsistent with these requirements in that it adds

19 street lighting, widens the road and its right-of-way to reduce setbacks, and

20 widens the road right-of-way and sidewalks.

21

22 73. The Project is inconsistent with the Natural Resources element of the 2010

23 General Plan Update. Goal NR-2, Visual Resources, provides for preservation of

24 significant visual resources, and Goal NR-3, Scenic Roads, provides for

25 maintenance and enhancement of the visual quality of City roads with valuable

26 scenic resources. The Project is inconsistent with policies under these goals in

27 that under the Project, the knoll would not be maintained, scenic views from

28 Agoura Road would be altered, and the Rim of the Valley Trail spur would be
eliminated.

29

30 74. The Project is inconsistent with the Land Use element of the 2010 General Plan

31 Update. Goal LU-3, City of Open Spaces, provides for preservation of open space

32 lands in Agoura Hills to maintain the City's visual quality, provide for recreation,

33 protect the public, and conserve natural resources. The Project is inconsistent

34 with policies under this goal in that the knoll would not be maintained, scenic

35

-
2 areas and views of hillsides would be altered, open space would be reduced, and
oak trees would be removed.

3
4

5 75. The purpose espoused in the Specific Plan is to create a destination to attract

6 visitors and residents to pedestrian-friendly, outdoor environment serving as a

7 gateway to the Santa Monica Mountains. By contrast, the Project is suited to a

cp transit-oriented development located in an urban area. The Cornerstone Project

9 is inconsistent with several policies of the Agoura Village Specific Plan, including,
but not limited to, the following:

10
11 a. Despite Specific Plan policies calling for the preservation of mature trees,

12 and especially of oak trees, whenever possible, the Project will adversely

13 impact up to all 59 coast live oak and valley oak trees located on the

14 Project site. Twenty-nine of the oak trees will be removed, and of the

15 remaining 30, between 6 and all 30 will experience encroachment into the

16 zones established to protect them from adverse development impacts.

17 Additionally, approximately one-third of the scrub oak habitat on-site

18 will be removed. The Project could be redesigned to (1) preserve more

19 oak trees and habitat; and (2) prevent encroachment into the protected

20 zones of the protected trees. This is a significant impact on both biological

21 resources and land use that is not mitigated by the MND. There are viable

22 alternatives that have not been analyzed.

23
24 b. The Specific Plan requires the Project to "minimize grading on existing

25 slopes and knolls to the greatest extent possible" and provides that

26 "[p] rominent and distinctive natural features of the area shall be

27 preserved and integrated as open space for the use and visual enjoyment

28 of all Village patrons and residents." The IS/MND claims that the Project

29 would include only minor grading along the edge of the knoll and would

30 greatly preserve the feature. However, the Project renderings demonstrate

31 that the only part of the knoll that would be preserved is a concrete ring

32 around four oak trees. Most of the knoll would be removed to widen

33 roadways at the intersection of Agoura Road and Cornell and to establish

34 a 10-foot sidewalk, retaining walls, and angled parking spaces.

35

. 17 -

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

-NMTNON DO C. The Mitigation, Monitoring and Reporting Program adopted with the
Specific Plan EIR requires preservation of "the majority of the knoll
located south and east of the intersection of Agoura and Cornell Road" to
avoid an otherwise significant aesthetic impact under CEQA. The
Project's failure to retain this knoll causes a significant aesthetic impact
that is not disclosed or mitigated in the MND, as well as a significant
impact on land use caused by the Project's inconsistency with the Specific
Plan.

d. The Specific Plan requires minimization of grading "by following the
on 10 natural contours," and specifically calls for minimization of grading 11 existing slopes and knolls in Zone E, where the Project is located. Instead, S0209500 the Project requires massive grading and 95,000 cubic yards of grading
and six months of truck trips to flatten out the site for development.

e. The Specific Plan recognizes and seeks to preserve the rural character of
the Agoura Village area. Figure 1.2, Agoura Village Vision, illustrates the
vision and shows Zone E, where the Project is located, as less densely
developed, with significant natural green space and natural view
19 corridors, envisioned as the more rural part of the Agoura Village project.
20 Instead of natural green space fronting scenic Agoura Road, the Project
21 includes buildings and cement sidewalks. An earlier proposed project for
22 the Cornerstone site was envisioned as an 85,000 square foot
23 development. The Project is over 116,000 square feet and is much denser
24 than the original vision in the Specific Plan.
25 Third Cause of Action 26 Violation of Agoura Hills Oak Tree Preservation Regulations, Agoura Hills 27 Municipal Code § § 9657-9657.5 28 (against all Respondents and Real Parties in Interest) 29 76. Petitioners incorporate g9 1-24 as though set forth here. 30

31 77. The Project conflicts with the City's oak tree ordinance, which states, "It shall be
32 the policy of the City of Agoura Hills to require the preservation of all healthy
33 oak trees unless compelling reasons justify the removal of such trees." (Agoura
34 Hills Municipal Code $ 9657.2.) The City ordinance requires oak tree permits to
35

18 -

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

-
2 comply with the provisions of the Oak Tree Preservation Guidelines. (Agoura

3 Hills Municipal Code $ 9657.5(F); see Agoura Hills Municipal Code Art. IX, App.

4 A.) The ordinance applies to both the tree itself, and to the "protected zone." Per

5 the Oak Tree Preservation Guidelines, the protected zone is defined as the area

6 extending from the trunk to 5 feet beyond the dripline, or 15 feet from the trunk,

7 whichever is greater. According to the City, oak trees are particularly sensitive to

0 disturbances within the protected zone, and activities within the protected zone

9 requires special attention. The Project would remove 29 coast live oak and valley

10 oak trees completely and encroach into the protected zone of up to all the

11 remaining 30, endangering their health. "Compelling reasons" do not include the

12 Applicant's failure to design a Project capable of retaining more trees or capable

13 of avoiding the protected zone of retained trees. The Project does not meet one of

14 the exemptions listed in Municipal Code $ 9657.4. Thus, the Project fails to

15 comply with the City's oak tree ordinance.

16
17 78. The City violated its Oak Tree Ordinance by granting the Project permits under

18 Municipal Code $ 9657. The ordinance prohibits the City from granting an oak
tree permit to remove

19 or encroach into the protected zone of an oak tree unless it

20 makes specific findings that "the continued existence totally prevents the

21 development of the subject property." (Municipal Code $ 9657.5.) While it is

22 reasonable that some of the trees would need to be removed or encroached upon

23 to build a development on the site consistent with the Agoura Village Specific

24 Plan, the removal of 29 coast live oak and valley oak trees, encroachment into the

25 protected zones of up to 30 others, and removal of approximately one-third of

26 the scrub oak habitat is not necessary to develop the property. Project building locations could be modified or resized to accommodate at least some of the site's

27 oak trees. The City lacks substantial evidence in support of its finding.

28
29 79. The grant of an oak tree permit is not authorized unless additional findings are

30 made. The City must find: (a) that the Project and tree removals can occur

31 without endangering the health of the remaining trees on the property; (b) that

32 the removal of the trees will not cause unmitigated soil erosion; and (c) that

33 avoidance of the removal would be cost-prohibitive or preclude the reasonable

34 and efficient use of the property. (Municipal Code $ 9657.5(C)(3)(a)-(c).)

35 However, the Project removes or encroaches into the protected zones of up to all

19 -

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

N - 59 coast live oak and valley oak trees, so the finding in (a) cannot be made. The

4 finding in (b) is countered by substantial evidence submitted by City resident
Samuel Unger that the Project's water quality impacts have not been mitigated.

5 The findings in (c) also cannot be made, as the record contains no evidence that

6 avoidance of removal or encroachment upon some of the trees for which the

7 permit was granted would be cost-prohibitive or preclude the reasonable use of

8 the property. There is no requirement that property be developed to its

9 maximum permitted square footage. Reasonable use is a smaller development

10 than the proposed Project.

11
12 80. The City violated its Oak Tree Ordinance by granting a permit to remove scrub

13 oak habitat without identifying and granting permits to remove specific scrub

14 oak trees. The City's Oak Tree Preservation Guidelines define protected oak trees

15 to include scrub oak trees and provides that a permit is requires for the removal

16 or encroachment into the protected zone of any oak tree larger than 2 inches in

3 diameter at 3.5 feet above the tree's natural grade. The Applicant failed to identify

18 and obtain permits to remove scrub oak trees meeting that standard in

19 compliance with these provisions, and the City violated its ordinance is granting
a

20 permit to remove scrub oak habitat, including scrub oak trees, without such
compliance.

21

22

23 81. The City's grant of the Oak Tree Permit violated its oak tree ordinance because
the total amount of oak trees and habitat approved for removal exceeded

24 ordinance limits. The City's ordinance allows for the issuance of a permit when

25 "[n]ot more than ten (10) percent of the total estimated tree canopy or root

26

27 structure of all trees on the subject property has been requested to be removed."

28 In exceptional cases, up to 20 percent of the total canopy or root system may be

29 removed, but only upon the recommendation of the City's oak tree preservation consultant after the consultant finds the oak tree's viability will not be adversely

30 affected. The IS/MND states that the Project "would result in impacts to 35

31

32 percent of the oak tree canopy resource on and off the project site." The Oak Tree
Permit was granted despite noncompliance with the 10 percent limitation.

33

34 Further, no evidence exists that the City's oak tree preservation consultant issued

35 the recommendation necessary for the 20 percent limitation to apply, and even if

20 -

such a recommendation had been made, the permit application failed to comply

2 with that limitation.
