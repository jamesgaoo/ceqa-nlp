INTRODUCTION
1.
2 This action challenges and seeks to enjoin the CITY OF SAN BERNARDINO ("City"),

3 CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SAN BERNARDINO ("City Council") and R. CAREY DAVIS,
acting in his official capacity of Mayor of City of San Bernardino (*Regional Planning") (collectively 4 "Respondents") action on February 21, 2017 and all subsequent actions approving Ordinance No. MC-
5 1456, an Ordinance of the Mayor and City Council of the City of San Bernardino, California, approving
6 General Plan Amendment 14-09 ("General Plan Amendment") and Development Code Amendment 14-
7 18 ("Zoning Map Amendment") to change the General Plan Land Use Designation from Multi-Family

8 Residential to Industrial and Zoning District Classification from Residential Medium High (RMH) to

9 Industrial Light (IL) of an area containing approximately 20.30 acres (APN: 1192-181-01, and 1192-

10 201-04) as well as Development Permit Type-D 16-25 to allow the development and establishment of

11 an industrial high cube logistics warehouse building containing approximately 420,000 square feet on a

12 site containing approximately 20.30 acres, along with the construction of the required on-site and off-
site improvements, located on the north side of 6th Street and east of north Sterling Avenue (*Project"). 13 2. The Project is a proposed high cube logistics warehouse building with a maximum of
14 450,000 square feet including up to 20,000 square feet that could be designated for office space. The
15 project would also include two driveways along the southern boundary off of Sixth Street and an
16 emergency only access point from McKinley Street. The conceptual site plan shows 32 loading docks
17 along the southern side of the building with vehicle parking along the east and west sides of the

18 warehouse building. An onsite retention basin would be placed in the southern portion of the site

19 adjacent to Sixth Street. Construction of public improvements to the adjacent public roadways will

20 consist of pavement widening, curb, gutters, and sidewalks.
3. In approving the Project, the City relied on an Initial Study Mitigated Negative 21 Declaration ("IS/ND") that found without substantial evidence that the Project would not have
22 significant environmental impacts.
23 4. In fact, evidence shows that the Project will have devastating and unmitigatable
24 environmental impacts on air quality, traffic, greenhouse gase emissions, biological resources and on
25 human health among others.

26 5. By failing to disclose, account for and mitigate for the Project's environmental impacts, ,

27 Respondents violated the California Environmental Quality Act, Cal. Pub Res. § Code § 21000 et seq

28 ("CEQA").
PARTIES
-1-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 6. Petitioner Community Science Institute ("CSI" or "Petitioner") a is a California non-profit

2 organization headquartered in Richmond, California. Founded in 2015, CSI aims to unite consumers and

3 industrial neighbors to reform government and industry practices for a toxic free future through
empowering citizens to conduct their own testing for contaminants and actively engage with local 4 decision-makers to protect the health of their communities. CSI has members who live, work, and
5 recreate in Imperial County who will be negatively affected by the Asphalt Plant's adverse
6 environmental impacts and improper approval. CSI is a project of Social and Environmental
7 Entrepreneurs ("SEE"), located in Calabasas, California. SEE was formed in 1994 as a 501(c)(3)

8 nonprofit organization. SEE's long-term vision is empowering individuals to turn their ideas of positive

9 change in their communities into action. Projects under SEE's sponsorship are not separate

10 organizations; rather, they are extensions of SEE's mission. As an umbrella organization for projects,

11 SEE's staff partners with project directors, and the combined effort of administrative, financial,

12 fundraising, and educational awareness come together to work towards progressive change.
7. CSI and its members have a direct and beneficial interest in Respondents' compliance
13 with laws bearing upon approval of the Project. These interests will be directly and adversely affected
14 by the Project, which violates provisions of law as set forth in this Petition and would cause substantial
15 harm to the natural environment and the quality of life in the surrounding community. The maintenance
16 and prosecution of this action will confer a substantial benefit on the public by protecting the public

17 from the environmental and other harms alleged herein. CSI actively participated in meetings hosted by

18 the County leading up to the proposal and adoption of the Project. CSI submitted comments to

19 Respondents objecting to and commenting on the Project and requesting compliance with CEQA.
8.
20 Defendant and Respondent CITY OF SAN BERNARDINO is a Charter City and
subdivision of the State of California, the "lead agency" for the Project for purposes of Public Resources 21 Code section 21067, and has principal responsibility for conducting environmental review for the
22 Project and taking other actions necessary to comply with CEQA.. The Project is within the
23 jurisdictional limits of the County.
24 9. Defendant and Respondent CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SAN BERNARDINO

25 IS the elected governing body of the City, and is the body responsible for the decision being challenged

26 herein.

27 10. Defendant and Respondent R. CAREY DAVIS ("Regional Planning") is the mayor of the

28 City, acting as its and is sued in his official capacity as Mayor of the City of San Bernardino.
11. Defendants and Respondents DOES - 10 are entities which the true names, capacities,
-2-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

corporate, associate are unknown to Petitioners at this time who, therefore, sues said Respondents by

2 fictitious names. Petitioners will amend this Petition to show the true names and capacities when
| ascertained.
3 12. Real Party in Interest NEIL GASCON, an individual ("Mr. Gascon," "Real Party," or
4 "Project Applicant") is the owner of the Project Site and is the applicant to the County for the Project'
5 general plan amendment and other associated entitlements.

6 13. Real Parties in Interest ROES 1 - 10 are entities which the true names, capacities,
7 corporate, associate are unknown to Petitioners at this time who, therefore, sues said Real Parties in

8 Interest by fictitious names. Petitioners will amend this Petition to show the true names and capacities

9 when ascertained.

10 JURISDICTION AND VENUE
14.
11 Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and section 1085 and
Public Resources Code sections 21168, 21168.5 and 21168.9, this Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ a 12 of mandate to set aside Respondents' decision to certify the EIR/EIS and purported approval of the 13 Project.
14 15. Venue is proper in this Court because the Project lies entirely within the County of Los
15 Angeles and the environmental impacts of the Project will be acutely felt in this County. The cause
16 alleged in this Petition, or some part of that cause, arise in this county. (CCP § 393; Cal. State Parks
17 Foundation v. Super. Ct. (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 826.) Venue is also proper in this Court pursuant to

18 Code of Civil Procedure Sections 394 (actions against a city, county or local agency), and 395 (actions

19 generally), since the City of Los Angeles is in the County of Los Angeles.
16.
20 This petition is timely filed within 30 days after Respondent's decision to issue a Notice
of Determination in accordance with Public Resources Code sections 21167(a). 21 17. Petitioner has provided written notice of their intention to file this petition to Respondent
22 in compliance with Public Resources Code section 21167.5, and are including the notice and proof of
23 service as Exhibit A.

24 18. Petitioner has concurrently filed a notice of their election to prepare the record of
25 administrative proceedings relating to this action, in compliance with Public Resources Code Section

26 21167.6 or other applicable laws, and are including the notice of this election as Exhibit B.

27 19. Petitioner has concurrently filed a request for hearing, in compliance with Public

28 Resources Code Section 21167.4 or other applicable laws, and are including a true and correct copy of
the request for hearing as Exhibit C.
-3-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 20. Petitioner has concurrently submitted notice to the Attorney General of California in

2 compliance, in compliance with Public Resources Code Section 21167.7 or other applicable laws, and

3 are including a true and correct copy of thenotice as Exhibit D.
21. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this instant action and 4 have exhausted administrative remedies to the extent required by law under Public Resources Code
5 section 21177. Petitioner and/or other agencies and individuals raised each of the legal deficiencies
6 asserted in this petition orally or in writing during the Respondents' decision-making process.
7 22. The violations by Respondent as alleged herein have affected the beneficial interests of

8 Petitioners and/or their supporting members. The relief sought by way of this Petition will redress this

9 I beneficial interest and the likelihood of future injury and interference with Petitioners' interests, and

10 those of its supporting members.

11 .23. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law unless

12 this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondent to set aside its certification of the
Project and environmental documents. In the absence of such remedies, Respondent's decisions will 13 remain in effect in violation of state law and injurious to Petitioners.
14 STATUTORY FRAMEWORK
15 California Environmental Quality Act

16 24. Passed in 1970 as a state counterpart to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA),
17 the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires state and local agencies to identify the

18 potentially significant environmental impacts of their actions, and then to avoid or mitigate those

19 impacts if feasible.
25.
20 CEQA requires that an agency analyze the potential environmental impacts of its
proposed actions in an environmental impact report (except in certain limited circumstances). See, e.g., 21 Cal. Pub. Res. Code (PRC) § 21100, et seq. The EIR is the very heart of CEQA. Dunn-Edwards v.
22 BAAQMD (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 644, 652. "The 'foremost principle' in interpreting CEQA is that the
23 Legislature intended the act to be read so as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment
24 within the reasonable scope of the statutory language." Cmtys. for a Better Env't v. Cal. Resources
25 Agency (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98, 109.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 26. CEQA requires that an agency analyze the potential environmental impacts of its

2 proposed actions in an environmental impact report (except in certain limited circumstances). See, e.g.,

3 Cal. Pub. Res. Code (PRC) § 21100, et seq. The EIR is the very heart of CEQA. Dunn-Edwards v.
BAAQMD (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 644, 652. "The 'foremost principle' in interpreting CEQA is that the
4 Legislature intended the act to be read so as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment
5 within the reasonable scope of the statutory language." Citys. for a Better Env't v. Cal. Resources
6 Agency (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98, 109.

7 27. CEQA has two primary purposes. First, CEQA is designed to inform decision makers

8 and the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of a project. 14 Cal. Code Reg.

9 ("CCR") § 15002(a)(1).) "Its purpose is to inform the public and its responsible officials of the

10 environmental consequences of their decisions before they are made. Thus, the EIR 'protects not only

11 the environment but also informed self-government.™ Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of Supervisors
(1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564. The EIR has been described as "an environmental 'alarm bell' whose
12 purpose it is to alert the public and its responsible officials to environmental changes before they have
13 reached ecological points of no return." Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay v. Bd. of Port Comrs: (2001)
14 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1354 ("Berkeley Jets").
15 28. Second, CEQA requires public agencies to avoid or reduce environmental damage when
16 "feasible" by requiring "environmentally superior" alternatives and all feasible mitigation measures. 14

17 CCR §.15002(a)(2) and (3); Citizens of Goleta Valley, supra, 52 Cal.3d at 564. The EIR serves to

18 provide agencies and the public with information about the environmental impacts of a proposed project

19 and to "identify ways that environmental damage can be avoided or significantly reduced." 14 CCR §
15002(a)(2).
20 29. The required CEQA environmental review involves both substantive and procedural 21 steps. Public participation plays an important and protected role in the CEQA process. Laurel Heights
22 Improvement Association v. Regents of the University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392 ("The
23 EIR process protects not only the environment but also informed self government."); Concerned
24 Citizens of Costa Mesa, Inc. v. 32nd District Agricultural Association (1986) 42 Cal.3d 929, 936
25 (members of the public have a "privileged position" in the CEQA process). "Each public agency should

26 include provisions in its CEQA procedures for wide public involvement, formal and informal, consistent

27 with its existing activities and procedures, in order to receive and evaluate public reactions to

28 environmental issues related to the agency's activities." 14 CCR § 15201. The lead agency must
consider all "comments it receives on a draft environmental impact report, proposed negative
-5-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- declaration, or proposed mitigated declaration." PRC, 21091(d)(1); 14 CCR § 15074(b).

2 30. Procedurally, a lead agency may not approve a project until the public has been given a

3 full and adequate opportunity to participate and comment on the project.
31.
4 CEQA also disallows approval of a projèct that fails to comply with other laws. A lead

5 agency may not approve a project with significant unavoidable impacts unless it is "otherwise

6 permissible under applicable laws and regulations." PRC §21002.1(c).
32.

7 An action alleging that a public agency is "carrying out or has approved a project that

8 may have a significant effect on the environment" without having followed CEQA procedures with a
legitimate approval of the project must be commenced within "180 days from the date of the public 9agency's decision to carry out or approve the project, or, if a project is undertaken without a formal

10 decision by the public agency, within 180 days from the date of commencement of the project." PRC §

11 21167(a).

12 33. PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL

13 This proceeding involves enforcement of important rights affecting the public interest.

14 Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a substantial benefit on the public, including

15 citizens, residents, businesses and taxpayers of the City, and will result in the enforcement of important

16 public rights by requiring Respondents to comply with CEQA and other legal requirements applicable to

17 the proposed Project; by voiding the Project approvals and prohibiting Respondents and Real Parties in

18 Interest from taking further actions with respect to the Project until it has complied with those legal
requirements; and by prohibiting the Respondents from undertaking any portion of the Project until they

19 have fully complied with these legal requirements
34.
20 Petitioners are entitled to recover attorneys' fees as provided in Code of Civil Procedure

21 section 1021.5 if they prevail in this action. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement of these

22 public rights entitle Petitioner to an award of reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to that section.

23 STATEMENT OF FACTS
•35.

24 The Project Site is an undeveloped 20.3-acre parcel just north of Sixth Street and east of

25 Sterling Avenue in the southeastern portion of the City (*Project Site").
36.

26 The Project Applicant applied for a General Plan Amendment and Zoning Map
Amendment to change the General Plan Land Use Designation from Multi-Family Residential to

27 Industrial and Zoning District Classification from Residential Medium High (RMH) to Industrial Light

28 (IL) for the Project Site ("Application").
37. On January 17, 2018, Respondents the Mayor and City Council conducted a public
-6-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 hearing concerning the Project, approved the Project including approving the General Plan Amendmient

2 and Zoning Map Amendment and adopted the IS / MND, scheduled the Project for a second reading on

3 or about February 7, 14 or 21, 2018, and adopted related findings.
38. On or about February 21, 2018, the Mayor and City Council conducted a second reading
4 for the Project and approved the Project.
5 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
6 (Violations of CEQA; EIR Does Not Comply With CEQA)

7 39. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate all the above paragraphs as if fully set forth

8 herein.

9 40. CEQA requires the lead agency for a project to prepare an environmental impact report,

10 initial study or mitigated negative declaration that complies with the requirements of the statute. The

11 lead agency also must provide for public review and comment on the project and associated

12 environmental documentation. An environmental impact report, initial study or mitigated negative
declaration must provide an adequate project description and sufficient environmental analysis such that
13 decision-makers can intelligently consider environmental consequences when acting on the proposed
14 project.
15 41. Respondents violated CEQA by certifying an initial study that fails to adequately analyze
16 and mitigate for the Project's environmental impacts, including but not limited to:

17 a. Failure to adequately analyze the Project's environmental baseline and impact.

18 b. Failure to provide an adequate project description. The Project's initial study

19 document's project description is inadequate as it omits a number of critical
details.
20
C. Adoption of deferred mitigation measures. The Project's initial study document 21 improperly defers critical details regarding many the Project's mitigation
22 measures.
23 d. Adoption of unenforceable mitigation measures.
24 e. Failure to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's cumulative impacts.
25 f. Failure to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's impact on oak woodlands.

26 g. Failure to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's impact on aesthetics

27 h. Failure to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's impacts on air quality.
i.
28 Failure to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's impact on biological

resources.

-7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

j. Failure to adequately analyze and mitigate the Project's impact to cultural

resources.
2
k.
3 Failure to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's impact on geology and
soils.
4 l. Failure to adequately analyze and mitigate the Project's impact on greenhouse gas
5 emissions.

6 m. Failure to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's impact on hazards &
7 hazardous materials.

8 n. Failure to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's impact on hydrology and

0 water quality.

10 O. Failure to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's impact on land use and
11 planning.

12 p. Failure to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's impact on noise.
q. Failure to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's impact on population, 13 housing and employment.
14 r. Failure to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's impact on public services.
15 S. Failure to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's impact on transportation.
16 t. Failure to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's impact on utilities.

17 42. As a result of the foregoing defects and others according to proof, Respondents

18 prejudicially abused their discretion by certifying an initial study that does not comply with CEQA and

19 by approving the Project in reliance thereon. Accordingly, Respondents' certification of the initial study

20 and purported approval of the Project must be set aside.
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
21 (Violations of CEQA; Failure to Substantially Support Factual Findings and Overriding
22 Considerations)
23 43. Petitioners hereby realleges and incorporates all of the above paragraphs as if fully set
24 forth herein.

25 44. CEQA requires that a lead agency's findings for the approval of a project be supported by
26 substantial evidence in the administrative record. CEQA further requires that a lead agency provide an

27 explanation of how evidence in the record supports the conclusions it has reached.

28

-&-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

45. Respondents violated CEQA by adopting findings that are inadequate as a matter of law

2 as they are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, including but not limited to the
following:
3
a. The determinations that the Project's environmental impacts would be less than 4 significant or that adopted mitigation measures would avoid or lessen the
5 Project's significant effects on the environment to less than significant levels.
6 46. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by
7 making determinations or adopting findings that do not comply with the requirements of CEQA and

8 approving the Project in reliance thereon. Accordingly, Respondents' certification of the initial study

9 and purported approval of the Project must be set aside.

10 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

11 WHEREFORE, Petitioner pray for judgment as set forth below:
A.
12 For a writ of mandate commanding Respondent to vacate and withdraw the certification

13 of the Initial Study and any purported approvals of the Project, and to require Respondents to complete
the CEQA environmental review and public comment period as required by law; 14 B. For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent
15 injunctions enjoining Respondent and Real Parties in Interest, and their agents, employees, officers or
16 representatives, and all persons acting in concert or participating with Real Parties in Interest from taking
17 any action to implement the project, unless and until Respondent fully complies with CEQA;
18 C. For a declaration of the rights and duties of the parties hereto, including but not limited
19 to a declaratory judgment that Respondent violated its duty pursuant CEQA by certifying the Initial

20 Study, issuing a Notice of Determination, curtailing the required public comment period, and purporting
to
21 approve the project and that the approval for the project, including the environmental document, are
null and void and without legal effect;
22 D. For petitioners' fees and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, as 23 authorized by California Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 and any other applicable provisions of
24 law; and

25 E. For such other relief as this Court deems appropriate and just.
