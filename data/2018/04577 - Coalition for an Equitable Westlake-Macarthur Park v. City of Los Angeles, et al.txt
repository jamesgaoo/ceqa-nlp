2 Petitioner, Coalition for an Equitable Westlake/Macarthur Park, alleges:

3 Introduction

4
5 1. By this action, Petitioner, Coalition for an Equitable Westlake/Macarthur Park

6 ("the Coalition"), challenges the unlawful actions of the City of Los Angeles, its

7 Department of City Planning, and its City Council, (collectively, the City) in

8 approving amendments to the City's General Plan, and associated land-use

9 entitlements, as well as a Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Lake on

10
- Wilshire Project ("the Project"), a mixed-use residential-commercial project with

12 a 220-room hotel, 478 residential dwelling units in 41-story tower, and a
69,979 square foot learning, cultural, and performing arts center that will include

13 an 850-seat theater. The Project will be built on a 70,912 square-foot (1.64-acre)

14 site located south of Wilshire Blvd between South Westlake Avenue and South

15 Bonnie Brae Street in the City of Los Angeles, County of Los Angeles ("the
Project Site").

16
17
18 2. The Project would loom over, and is completely incompatible with, the existing

19 buildings on the Project Site and on adjacent parcels. Additionally, the Project,

20 with an entirely incompatible new building, will loom over and diminish the

~ character and structure of a known historic resource on the Project Site. The

22. Project's density in an already massively dense urban area will increase already-

23 frustrated traffic in the area, and will require mass grading, as well as the

24 removal and encroachment upon 79 trees, all of which conflicts with the City's

25 General Plan and the Westlake Community Plan. Further, the Project will cause

.- ... 26 significant environmental effects of many other types, including to aesthetic, and

27 biological resources, and air quality, traffic, noise, greenhouse-gas, and
hazardous materials impacts.

28
29 3. The significant environmental impacts listed in the previous paragraph will not

30 be mitigated into insignificance by the mitigation measures listed in the

31 Mitigated Negative Declaration. CEQA therefore requires the City to prepare an

32 Environmental Impact Report for the Project.

15 aside its certification of the Project and environmental documents. In the absence

16 of such remedies, the City's decisions will remain in effect in violation of the
state law and injurious to Petitioner.

18 The Project

19
20 13. The Project at issue in this case is the proposed construction of a mixed-use

21 development known as the T.ake on Wilshire Project, with 478 residential

22 dwelling units housed in a 41-story, 514,887 square-foot residential tower; a 220-

23 room hotel; and a 69,979 square-foot learning, cultural, and performing arts

24 conter with an 850-seat theater that will be located on a site south of Wilshire
Boulevard between South Westlake Avenue and South Bonnie Brae Street.

25
26 14. The Project Site is currently occupied by an existing 14-story, 115,560 square-

27 28 foot medical office building and surrounding parking. The existing building,
originally known as the Wilshire Medical Building, is a designated historical

29 resource, listed in the California Register of Historical Resources and eligible for

30 listing in the National Register of Historic Places. The Project would convert the

31 existing medical office building into a 220-room hotel and construct taller

13 22, In approving the MND, the City violated the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code §§ 21000-21189.3 ("CEQA") and the CEQA

14
15 Guidelines (14 Cal. Code Regs. §§ 15000-15387 plus appendices) in significant
ways, some of which are described in the following paragraphs.

16
17 23. The City has also failed to disclose, analyze, and mitigato the Project's

18 significant adverse environmental impacts in multiple areas, including aesthetic,

19 cultural, land use, noise, traffic, and air quality impacts, as well as the cumulative

allowed by the City.

3 insignificance without a redesign, so the City must prepare an EIR for the
Project.

5 Biological Resources

6

7 28. 79 trees grow on the Project Site. The Project would remove all 79 of these trees.

8 The removal of 79 trees is a significant adverse impact on biological resources

9 that is not adequately analyzed or mitigated in the MND. The MND fails to

10 quantify and discuss the canopy to be lost by the removal of these trees, and the
various potential effects of that loss.
11
12 29. Elimination of the trees at the Project Site has indirect global-warming effects by

13 increasing energy needs and decreasing carbon dioxide absorption. An EIR is

14 required to analyze these significant environmental effects.

15
16 30. Mitigation measure MM-4-1 provides that the Applicant will implement

17 mitigation measures for replacement of trees with trunks whose diameters are 8

18 inches or more at 54 inches above the ground. The measure, however, relies on a

19 future plot plan to identify the sizes of trees, and the MND thus fails to identify

20 how many trees will be replaced. In the absence of that information, it is

21 impossible to judge how effective the mitigation measure will be in mitigating

22 the loss of trees and the associated adverse effects. The "caliper" measures

23 provided for the existing trees do not provide a measurement for each tree,

24 instead listing several trees in single entries, as if all have the exact same
measurements.

25
26 31. MM-4-1 represents ineffective mitigation. The measure provides for the

27 replacement of mature trees at a 1:1 ratio with trees as small as a 24-inh-box-tree.

28 Such a replacement plan cannot mitigate fully for the environmental effects of

29 reduced tree canopy. Moreover, the mitigation measure contains no measures to

30 ensure survival of the replacement trees.

31
32 32. In failing to provide information necessary to show the mitigation measure will

33 be effective to reduce impacts, the MND fails to adequately demonstrate that

34 impacts to biological resources will be less than significant, and an EIR is
required.

Cultural Resources

33. The MND section on Cultural Resources concludes the Project will not have a 2

3 significant impact on the significance of a historical resource, The Wilshire 4 Medical Building is a historical resource under CEQA, and the MND recognizes 5 that if the character-defining features of the building are not retained, there would 00 result a potential adverse effect to the significance of the building. Yet the MND
fails to explain how the building's interior character-defining features will be 8 retained. Multiple such features are identified in the MND, including the lobby 9 with its marble and plaster features, the bronze-framed building director and 10 bronze U.S. Mail letter box and chute, the elevator lobby with original decorative 11 incised bronze doors, the fire hose cabinet, stairwell with marble, metal, and
only that the Project would 12 wood features, and so forth. The MND states cY; 14 rehabilitate and adaptively reuse the Wilshire Medical Building for a use as a hotel, rehabilitating the lobby and ground-floor retail spaces as a hotel a lobby, bar, and 15 restaurant, rehabilitating the second floor as a business center, and rehabilitating 16 the remaining floors with guestrooms. There is no showing that this renovation 17 can be accomplished without destroying many of the character-defining features, 18 and there is no discussion of Project plans to avoid such destruction. Substantial 19 evidence exists that the Project will cause significant impacts to this historical 20 resource.
21
22 34. The MND fails to provide any adequate mitigation to ensure the retention of
23 essential character-defining features of the historic building. The mitigation
far short of what CEQA requires in this 24 measures for historical resources fall

26 qualified historic preservation consultant to oversee the
27 This is vague and deferred mitigation, which improperly deferred analysis that
28 should have been included in the MND. In the absence of this analysis, there is
29 no substantial evidence to support the conclusion that impacts to historical
resources will be less than significant. There is therefore a fair argument that the 30
31 Project will have a significant effect on this historical resource even with the
-.•. • 32 planned mitigation.
33 .- 35. Additionally, the MND concludes without substantial evidence that the addition 34 of the cultural center, parking structure, and residential tower will not 35

significantly impact the integrity or significance of the Wilshire Medical
2 Building. The MND asserts that the east and south facing facades are secondary,
m 7oto and appears to suggest that other buildings blocking views of those facades
would thus not interfere with the building's importance as a historic resource. But there is no analysis to support that inference. The MND asserts that the majority of the east and south facades would be largely visible from most
vantage points. In the complete absence of analysis to support that conclusion,
despite the fact that buildings will be added to the south, to the east, and to the
9 southeast of the Wilshire Medical Building, the record does not demonstrate that
10 significant impacts to this cultural resource will not occur, and instead,
11 substantial evidence exists that such impacts will occur. Moreover, the MND
12 identifies the rear entrance of the building as a primary character-defining feature
13 of the historic building, but fails to explain how the Project will preserve the
14 importance of that entrance when a parking structure will obstruct views of it.
15 Additionally, the architectural styles of the new buildings proposed on the
16 Project Site, and in particular that of the cultural center, are incompatible with the
17 style of the Wilshire Medical Building, so that their construction adjacent to the
18 historic building will cause a significant impact to the intogrity and significance
19 of the building as a historical resource.

20 36. The MND improperly concludes that the Project's impacts to paleontological 21 resources will be less than significance. According to the MND, the Natural 22 History Museum stated that excavations of more than a few feet may uncover 23 significant vertebrate fossils. Disturbing such paleontological resources would be 24 a potentially significant adverse effect. The Natural History Museum 25 recommended that sediment samples from finer-grained deposits be collected and 26 processed to determine the small fossil potential in the proposed project area. The 27 MND states that compliance with regulatory compliance measure RCM-5-2 28 would render any impacts to paleontological resources less than significant. Yet, 29 that regulatory compliance measure, the only measure to address such impacts, 30 does not provide for any capture and processing of excavated material, so 31 potential impacts to small fossils are unaddressed in the MND, despite Project 32 plans that include excavation deep enough for two stories of underground 33 parking. Because of this omission, there is a fair argument that there will be 34 unmitigated significant effects to paleontological resources. 35

Land Use

2 37. As alleged below, the Project is inconsistent with the General Plan and Westlake
A 0 0 O u Community Plan, but the IS and MND do not discuss these inconsistencies.
CEQA requires any inconsistencies between a proposed project and applicable
land use plans to be discussed in a Project's environmental documentation. A

is completely incompatible with the existing buildings on the Project site, and 10
11 incompatible with all the buildings on adjacent parcels.

12 39. The IS/MND concludes, with no discussion, that the Project is compatible with
13 land uses on the Project Site, and with the surrounding land uses, but this
14 conclusory statement is not supported by substantial evidence. A 41-story
15 apartment tower is physically incompatible with existing uses on the Project Site
16 and with what is around it, when the tallest building in the vicinity is 14 stories
17 high. The MND itself states that "buildings in the area generally range in height
18 from one to three stories.' None of the buildings near the Project Site reach
19 anywhere close to 41 stories. The scale of the Project does not match onsite
20 existing conditions or adjacent land use and scale, since a 41-story tower would
21 loom over existing and adjacent buildings. The Project would require a general
22 plan amendment, which on its own shows that the Project is incompatible, since
23 it is asking the City for permission to violate the General Plan,
24
25 40. Additionally, there are at least four schools within 400 feet of the Project, and the
26 Project is asking for a conditional use permit to allow the sale and consumption
27 of alcohol within 1400 feet of the schools. This requested use is incompatible
-+* - 28 with current land use and planning.

29 41. An IS is required to support findings such as the finding of no significant land-
30 use impacts with substantial evidence and reasoned discussion. The lack of any
31 basis for the conclusion that the Project will have no significant land-use effects .a a.a . 32 violates CEQA and is sufficient ground for setting aside the MND.

bat Air Quality

2

3 42. The MND states that the CEQA Guidelines, section 15064.7, provides that the

4 significance criteria established by the applicable air quality management district

5 may be relied upon to make determinations of significance and that the project's

6 air quality impacts are evaluated according to thresholds developed by the

7 SCAQMD. Guidelines section 15064.7 allows a lead agency to consider the

8 thresholds of significance recommended by other public agencies only if the

9 decision of the lead agency to adopt these thresholds is supported by substantial

10 evidence. The MND does not provide substantial evidence for adoption of
SCAQMD thresholds because the MND fails to explain or discuss how it arrived

12 at the specific thresholds on which the City relied, and fails to justify why

13 adoption of those thresholds is appropriate for the Project. The City thus failed to

14 meet its obligation to undertake a fact-based investigation of the Project's

15 potential impacts on air quality, and to explain the basis for its determination that

16 those impacts are mitigable to a level of significance.

17 43. The MND fails to properly analyze cumulative effects on air quality as a result of a

18 the project and other proposed developments near the Project Site. Under CEQA,
19 88 cumulative impacts of a particular adverse effect may be significant even if the

21 direct effects of that type are not significant, An effect will be cumulatively
significant if the effect, combined with the same effect from other projects in the
22 area, will be significant, and the proposed project makes a "cumulative

23 considerable" contribution to the overall effect.

24
25 44. The MND appears to assert that during the construction phase, localized

26 concentrations of CO, PM2.s, PM10. and NO2 would not exceed ambient air

27 quality standards because none of the proposed projects included in the analysis

28 would individually exceed localized significance thresholds (*LSTs")---or if any

29 did, that project would mitigate any significant localized emissions. But this

30 misunderstands the essence of a cumulative analysis, which requires analysis of

31 the combined effects of multiple projects' impacts that may individually fall

.d. 32 below a threshold of significance. To say that each project's impacts falls below

33 a threshold does not address the question for analysis with respect to cumulative
effects.

45. The MND's analysis of cumulative operational impacts is similarly flawed. It is
2 inadequate to state that the Project's air quality impacts would not exceed the
Wy operational thresholds and therefore its cumulative impacts would be less than
4 significant. The MND conclusorily asserts that existing land uses in the area do
1o o not produce substantial emissions of localized nonattainment pollutants, but fails
to provide any evidence or analysis to support that conclusion, and therefore fails
7 to establish that the Project's effects will be less than significant.
8 46. The MND's analysis of air quality impacts on sensitive receptors is inadequate to 9 show that significant impacts will not occur. The MND states that sensitive 10 receptors include schools, yet it fails to identify or discuss potential effects on 52224 schools near the Project Site. Elsewhere in the MND, five schools are listed
within 1,300 feet of the site (two of those approximately 200 feet from the site).
In omitting those schools from the discussion of sensitive receptors, the MND
15 fails to adequately analyze related air quality impacts. Further, if the schools
were deemed to be too distant from the site for such an analysis to be necessary, 16 the MND failed to explain that determination, as required. Because of the failure 17 to provide sufficient analysis or evidence that air quality impacts on sensitive 18 receptors will be less than significant, the MND must be set aside. 19
20 Traffic
21 47. When discussing the 1,355 net new trips caused by the Project, the MND
22 a incorporates a 10 percent internal capture reduction, but does so without
23 supporting analysis or supporting evidence. Additionally, the Project is in very 24 close proximity to four elementary and middle schools. However, the mitigation 25 measure proposed to address the significant impact created by the increase in 26 traffic caused by the Project simply defers mitigation, because the MND states
27 that some plan will be developed in the future, but doesn't explain what that plan 28 is, nor does it allow for it an analysis of that plan or any safety measures that will
29 be put in place. Sufficient analysis is necessary due to the increasing car-
30 accident-related fatalities and injuries occurring in the City of Los Angeles. The
31 MND lacks sufficient analysis of how pedestrians, especially the children in the 32 area, will be protected due to the new trips generated by the Project. The
33 existence of this potentially significant environmental impact must be analyzed 34 in an EIR.

Noise
Nmtion 00 48. The MND concludes that off-site construction-related noise impacts would be
less than significant, but the explanation for that conclusion is insufficient.
Hauling of excavated soils would involve an average of 107 haul trips per day
via Wilshire Boulevard and Alvarado Street. The MND states that this vehicle
activity would only marginally increase ambient noise levels along the haul route, but neither sufficient analysis nor substantial evidence is provided to
support that assertion. Although according to the MND, a 3 dBA increase in
9 roadway noise requires an approximate doubling of roadway traffic volume
10 assuming the travel speed and fleet mix remain constant, the addition of haul
11 trucks to the roadways will change the fleet mix. For that reason, the MND's
12 statement that the addition of haul trucks would not nearly double the traffic
13 volumes on local roadways is irrelevant and unsupported by record evidence.
14 Substantial evidence exists that the added roadway noise from the haul trucks
15 will likely be greater than 5 dBA, and there is fair argument that the Project's
16 construction-related activities may have a significant effect on off-site noise
17 impacts.
18
19 Greenhouse Gases

20 49. The MND's analysis of greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions compares the Project
21 with an estimated No Action Taken ("NAT") Scenario, in which GHG emissions
22 are estimated in the absence of any GHG reduction measures. The MND states
23 that the analysis uses the 2014 Revised AB 32 Scoping Plan's statewide goals as
24 an approach to evaluate the Project's emissions, and that the reductions in CO2e

: 25 emissions for the Project exceed the State's AB 32 Scoping Plan goal, so the
26 Project would exceed its contribution to statewide climate change obligations.
27
sF...m 28 50. The NAT scenario used in the MND's GHG analysis is a totally artificial

29 construct and a hypothetical version of the Project not based in any reality. It

30 ignores the actual situation on the ground, and the applicable law and regulations.

31 For example, the MND states that the NAT scenario would not consider site-

32 specific conditions, such as the project's mixed-use nature and proximity to

33 public transportation.

5 no substantial evidence that a project-level reduction of GHGs in comparison

6 a with a business-as-usual scenario was consistent with achieving AB 32's

7 statewide goal of reducing GHIGs 29 percent below business as usual. Because

8 the MND relies on analysis that the Supreme Court has invalidated and was

9 therefore an improper analysis, there is a fair argument that the Project, with

10 estimated annual GHG emissions of 9,637 COze, may have significant GHG
impacts.
11
12 52. This analysis is supported by the SCAQMD's threshold of 3,000 MTCO2e for

13 mixed-use projects such as this one. This Project will exceed the SCAQMD

14 threshold by greater than a factor of three. The "net emissions" of 4,911

15 identified in the MND also exceed the SCAQMD threshold by 64%. So there is

16 a therefore a fair argument that the Project's GHG emissions will be significant,

17 even after the mitigation proposed in the MND. CEQA requires an EIR to be

18 prepared.

19 Hazardous Materials

20
21 53. In the past, the Project Site contained a gas station and auto repair facility, which

22 represent a recognized environmental condition, according to the MND. The

23 MND explains that past site assessments have identified petroleum hydrocarbons

24 in the soil, including benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, and MTBE. The

25 process of vapor intrusion, even at low concentrations, can lead to the

26 accumulation of volatile chemicals in interior spaces and pose significant

27 human health risk. The MND fails to evaluate the concentrations of these

28 chemicals found on the Site for their significance and potential toxicity, thereby

29 presenting inadequate analysis of this potentially significant environmental

30 impact.

31
32 54. The MND concludes there is a potential for asbestos-containing building

33 materials and lead-based paint at the Project Site, and it acknowledges that

34 exposure to asbestos and lead could be hazardous to the health of demolition

35 workers and area residents and employees. Despite the potential for a significant

13 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- .

2 impact, the MND indicates that no testing was completed for asbestos-containing

3 building materials or lead-based paint. The City thus failed to undertake the

4 required fact-based investigation of the Project's potential effects from these
hazardous materials, and the MND should be set aside

6
7 55. Given the age of the existing structures on the Project Site, it is not only possible,

8 but highly likely, that lead-based paints, asbestos, and mold exist onsite. The

9 MND does not appropriately evaluate or disclose the potential impacts and risks

10 associated with the release, disposal, and exposure to people of lead-based paints,

11 asbestos, petroleum hydrocarbon contamination, and mold. The MND simply

12. makes a conclusion, without substantial evidence, that compliance with the Los

2 Angeles Municipal Code's methane regulations would serve as a substitute for a

14 mitigation measure; however, following the law (here, the municipal code) is not
a mitigation measure under CEQA,

15
16 56. The MND relies on regulatory compliance measure RCM-8-1 to support its

17 conclusion that impacts from release of hazardous materials will be less than

18 significant with mitigation. RCM-8-1 does not provide for a method to determine

19 whether asbestos-containing materials are present, and provides only that a lead-

20 based paint survey will be performed to the written satisfaction of the

21 Department of Building and Safety. This measure is insufficient to meet the

22 requirement that the MND evaluate impacts before the MND is adopted and the

23 Project is approved. Because the potential for a significant impact exists and the

24
-.. MND fails to show the regulatory compliance measure would mitigate the

25 impact, there is a fair argument that the Project will have a significant impact on

26 health from asbestos and lead exposure.

.-• 27
28 57. The MND concludes, without adequate support, that there would be less than

29 significant impacts with respect to whether the Project may release toxic

30 emissions within one-quarter mile of an existing or proposed school. The MND

31 identifies five schools within that distance from the Project Site. The conclusion

32 that impacts to individuals at those schools would be less than significant relies

33 on the inadequate regulatory compliance measure RCM-8-1. The MND also

34 conclusorily states that the schools would be generally shielded from the Project

35 Site by their distances, intervening urban buildings, and construction walls and
sheeting. No evidence exists to support this assertion. It is illogical to assert that

14 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

H
2
3
4 the schools' less-than-one-quarter-mile distances from the Site will protect them,

5 when the MND acknowledges that a significant adverse effect may occur if the

6 Project Site is within one-quarter mile of the schools. The assertion that

7 intervening urban buildings will shield the schools is also illogical, given that

8 those buildings do not constitute an impenetrable barrier. Record evidence shows

9 that even low levels of exposure to lead is known to affect children's brain

10 development and to harm other body systems. Particularly given these serious

3= health effects to children from lead exposure, the MND's analysis of Project

12 impacts is inadequate, and there is a fair argument that potentially significant
impacts will result from the Project.

ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR)
INFORMATION PACKET

The person who files a civil lawsuit (plaintiff) must include the ADR information
Packet with the complaint when serving the defendant. Cross-complainants must
serve the ADR Information Packet on any new parties named to the action
together with the cross-complaint.

1 i-a There are a number of ways to resolve civil disputes without having to sue
someone. These alternatives to a lawsuit are known as alternative dispute
resolution (ADR).
In ADR, trained, impartial persons decide disputes or help parties decide disputes
themselves. These persons are called neutrals. For example, in mediations, the
neutral is the mediator. Neutrals normally are chosen by the disputing parties or by
the court. Neutrals can help resolve disputes without having to go to court.

Mediation is particularly effective when the partles have a continuing relationship, like

•*- • neighbors or business people. Mediation is also very effective where personal feelings are getting in the way of a resolution. This is because mediation normally gives the parties a chance
to express their feelings and find out how the other sees things.
Mediation may not be effective when one party is unwilling to cooperate or compromise or when one of the parties has a significant advantage in power over the other. Therefore, it may a not be a good choice if the parties have a history of abuse or victimization.

In arbitration, a neutral person called an "arbitrator" hears arguments and evidence from each Arbitration

side and then decides the outcome of the dispute. Arbitration is typically less formal than a trial, and the rules of evidence may be relaxed. Arbitration may be either "binding" or "non- binding." Binding arbitration means the parties waive their right to a trial and agree to accept the arbitrator's decision as final. Non-binding arbitration means that the parties are free to request a trial if they reject the arbitrator's decision.
Arbitration is best for cases where the parties want another person to decide the outcome of their dispute for them but would like to avoid the formality, time, and expense of a trial. It may also be appropriate for complex matters where the parties want a decision-maker who has
training or experience in the subject matter of the dispute.

Mandatory Settlement Conference (MSC)

Settlement Conferences are appropriate in any case where settlement Is an option. Mandatory Settlement Conferences are ordered by the Court and are often held near the date
a case is set for trial. The parties and their attorneys meet with a judge who devotes his or her time exclusively to preside over the MSC. The judge does not make a decision in the case but assists the parties in evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the case and in negotiating a
settlement.

The Los Angeles Superior Court Mandatory Settlement Conference (MSC) program is free of charge and staffed by experienced sitting civil judges who devote their time exclusively to presiding over MSCs. The judges participating in the judicial MSC program and their locations are identified in the List of Settlement Officers found on the Los Angeles Superior Court website

program on the at http://www.lacourt.org/.This program is available in general jurisdiction cases with represented parties from independent calendar (IC) and Central Civil West (CCW) courtrooms. In addition, on an ad hoc basis, personal injury cases may be referred to the eve of trial by the personal injury master calendar courts in the Stanley Mosk Courthouse or the
asbestos calendar court in CCW. -.. .-
In order to access the Los Angeles Superior Court MSC Program the judge in the IC courtroom, ..-i -.... .. the CCW Courtroom or the personal injury master calendar courtroom must refer the parties to
the program. Further, all parties must complete the information requested in the Settlement
Conference Intake Form and email the completed form to mscdept18@lacourt.org.
