25 TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA:

26 PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 21167.7, that on

27 October 26, 2018, Petitioners CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION AND

28 ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ("CCAEJ") and SIERRA CLUB filed a Verified Petition for

NOTICE TO ATTORNEY GENERAL OF VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Peremptory Writ of Mandate pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)
2 challenging the approval by the COUNTY OF SAN BERNARDINO of the Slover Distribution
3 Center Project, which is a proposal for the construction and operation of an industrial high
4 cube/warehouse building, totaling 344,000 square feet and 45 feet high, on 17.34 vacant acres in
5 the unincorporated community of Bloomington in the County of San Bernardino. To permit this
6 use, the Project requires a General Plan Amendment from residential to industrial.
7 The Project will operate as a high cube/warehouse distribution facility, meaning that diesel
8 trucks traveling from locations such as the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles will bring cargo to
9 the warchouse building for storage and sorting for transport on other trucks to destinations in and
10 outside California. These operations will occur 24 hours per day, seven days per week. Existing
11 single-family residences are located immediately to the south of the Project site and in fact surround
12 the Project on three sides. Trucks servicing the Project will travel on Slove Avenue adjacent to
13 residences in route to Interstate 10.

14 As alleged in the Verified Petition (transmitted herewith), CCAEJ has identified the
15 unincorporated area of Bloomington in San Bernardino County as "community at risk" for various
16 environmental injustices including bearing disproportionate share of the impacts from high
17 polluting industries, heavy-duty diesel truck and other mobile source emissions, and suffering other
18 disparities created by zoning and irresponsible land use planning. Accordingly, CCAEJ, together

19 with Sierra Club and other environmental groups, filed extensive comments that are part of the
20 administrative record for the County's approval of the Project and Final EIR. CCAEJ's members
21 are extremely concerned that the Project will detrimentally impact their health and wellbeing, and

22 the health and wellbeing of their children, of their community, and the environment, and that it will
23 detrimentally impact the area's surrounding resources.

24 The Verified Petition alleges that the County failed to comply with CEQA in certifying an

25 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the Project. Among other deficiencics, the EIR

26 underestimates air quality and noise impacts by omitting relevant information and relying upon

27 false assumptions about the nature and extent of the Project's operations and truck activity. The

28

2
NOTICE TO ATTORNEY GENERAL OF VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

2 EIR also ignores feasible mitigation and alternatives to reduce significant air quality impacts •

4 namely measures and alternatives that would lessen the Project's harmful diesel emissions.
For the reasons alleged in the Verified Petition for Peremptory Writ of Mandate, the
decisions approving the Project and certifying the Project's EIR must be overturned.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 I. INTRODUCTION

2 l. On September 25, 2018, the San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors ("Board")

3 approved the Slover Distribution Center ("Project") - a warehouse development in close proximity

4 to homes and schools in the community of Bloomington. On the same day, the Board also approved

5 a final environmental impact report ("Final EIR") that purports to, but fails to analyze the

6 widespread impacts of the Project's construction and operation.

7 2. This project is one of many warehouses that has been approved in the Bloomington portion

8 of San Bernardino County, which impose large impacts on community residents and school children.

9 The project design so close to residences and schools compelled State Senator Connie Levya and

10 State Assembly Representative Eloise Gomez Reyes to write the following in an Opinion Editorial to

11 the Inland Empire Community News: "The approval of the proposed warehouse in Bloomington by

12 the San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors will further erode our quality of life and have

13 serious health impacts on the hardworking community that will be most directly impacted by this

14 project."

15 3. As a result, Petitioners bring this action on their behalf, on behalf of their members, the

16 general public, and in the public interest, to compel the County to adhere to the California

17 Environmental Quality Act's ("CEQA") critical environmental review and mitigation requirements

18 designed to maintain a high-quality, healthy environment for all Californians.

19 II. PARTIES

20 4. Petitioner and Plaintiff CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL

21 JUSTICE ("CCAEJ*) is a membership-based California non-profit environmental health and justice

22 organization with its membership in and around San Bernardino County. CCAEJ's mission is to
23 bring people together to improve their social and natural environment, and to build community

24 power in order to create safer, healthier, toxic free places to live, work, learn and play in and around

25 the counties of Riverside and San Bernardino. CCAEJ has its physical offices in Jurupa Valley and

26 organizes to build leadership for community action in Jurupa Valley, Mira Loma, Riverside, the

27 unincorporated areas in San Bernardino County as well as other cities throughout the counties of

28 Riverside and San Bernardino. CCAEJ has identified the unincorporated area of Bloomington in

2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

] San Bernardino County as a "community at risk" for various environmental injustices including

2 bearing a disproportionate share of the impacts from high polluting industries, heavy-duty diesel

3 truck and other mobile source emissions, and suffering other disparities created by zoning and

4 irresponsible land use planning. Accordingly, CCAEJ, together with the co-petitioner to this action

5 and other environmental groups, filed extensive comments that are part of the administrative record

6 for the County's approval of the Project and Final EIR. CCAEJ's members are extremely concerned

7 that the Project will detrimentally impact their health and wellbeing, and the health and wellbeing of

8 their children, of their community, and the environment, and that it will detrimentally impact the

0 area's surrounding resources. Most of CCAEJ's members who reside in and in around the

10 unincorporated area of Bloomington in San Bernardino County and around the proposed site for the

11 Project already suffer a disproportionate burden from existing stationary and mobile sources of

12 pollution, including significant air pollution from, inter alia, the movement of goods throughout

13 region to existing warehouses and other storage and distribution centers.

14 5. Petitioner and Plaintiff SIERRA CLUB is a national nonprofit organization of approximately
15 600,000 members. Sierra Club is dedicated to exploring, enjoying, and protecting the wild places of

16 the earth; to practicing and promoting the responsible use of the earth's ecosystems and resources; to

17 educating and encouraging humanity to protect and restore the quality of the natural and human
18 environment; and to using all lawful means to carry out these objectives. Sierra Club's particular

19 interest in this case and the issues that this Project approval concerns stem from the Sierra Club's
20 local San Gorgonio Chapter's interests in preserving the native, endangered, imperiled and sensitive

21 species and wildlife habitats in the region; decreasing rather than increasing heavy-duty and

22 medium-duty truck traffic in an already highly overburdened air basin; and ensuring that good,

23 livable and healthy jobs are brought to the area. The members of the San Gorgonio Chapter live,

24 work, and recreate in and around the areas that will be directly affected by the construction and

25 operation of the Project. Sierra Club submitted extensive comments to the County throughout its

26 environmental review process for the Project that are part of the County's record of its decision to

27 approve the Project and its Final EIR.

28

3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

6. By this action, Petitioners seek to protect the health, welfare, and economic interests of their

2 members and the general public and to enforce the County's duties under CEQA. Petitioners'

3 members and staff have an interest in their health and well-being, in the health and well-being of

4 others, including the residents of the unincorporated area of Bloomington in San Bernardino County

5 and its surrounding areas and in the region. Petitioners also have strong interest in conserving and

6 protecting the environment, in protecting the aesthetic and ecological integrity of the areas

7 surrounding the Project area, and have economic interests in San Bernardino County. Petitioners'

8 staff and members who live and work near the Project also have a right to and a beneficial interest in

9 the County's compliance with CEQA. These interests have been, and continue to be, threatened by

10 the County's decision to certify the Final EIR and approve the Project in violation of CEQA. Unless

11 the relief requested in this case is granted, Petitioners' staff and members will continue to be

12 adversely affected and irreparably injured by the County's failure to comply with CEQA.

13 7. Respondent and Defendant COUNTY OF SAN BERNARDINO (the "County") is organized

14 and existing under the Constitution and laws of the State of California, with the capacity to sue and

15 be sued.

16 8. As referred to herein, the County consists of all boards including Respondent and Defendant

17 SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS, commissions and departments

18 including the current Planning and/or Land Use Department and/or the County's Planning

19 Il Commission.

20 9. The County is the "lead agency" as the term is defined by CEQA, and is therefore, charged

21 with principal responsibility for carrying out or approving the Project, and for evaluating the

22 Project's environmental impacts pursuant to CEQA. (Pub. Res. Code § 21067.)
23 10. The County approved the Project and the EIR at issue in this case, and based on information

24 and belief authorized and filed or caused to be filed at least three Notices of Determination certifying

25 the EIR and approving a Statement of Overriding Considerations, the last of which was the only

26 relevant Notice of Determination for statute of limitations purposes and was posted by the County of

27 San Bernardino's County Clerk on September 27, 2018.

28

4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 11. Petitioners are informed and believe on that basis allege that JM REALTY GROUP, INC., a

2 California Corporation, is a Real Party in Interest insofar as (1) it is the entity named and thereby

3 identified on the County's public notice documents relating to the Project including its September

4 27, 2018 Notice of Determination, pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6.5, and (2) it is

5 the entity listed as owner and developer of the property subject to the County's actions pursuant to

6 its approval of the Project and the Final EIR, including the County's execution of the development

7 agreement required by the Project.

8 12. Petitioners do not know the true names and capacities of Real Parties in Interest, Does

9 through 100 inclusive, and therefore, name them by such fictitious names. Petitioners will seek

10 leave from the Court to amend this petition to reflect the true names and capacities of Does

11 through 100 inclusive once they have been ascertained.

12 III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

13 13. Venue is proper in the Superior Court of California, County of San Bernardino under Code of

14 Civil Procedure section 395 because the County, its Board of Supervisors and the proposed project

15 are currently located, or will be located, in San Bernardino County.

16 14. Venue is also proper in the Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 393, 394.

17 15. The action is filed in the Civil Division of the San Bernardino District located in the San
18 Bernardino Justice Center, 247 West 3rd Street, San Bernardino, CA, 92415-0210 in accordance with

19 the General Order - Where to File Documents - dated January 10, 2018, which requires all CEQA

20 Petitions for Writ of Mandate to be filed in this Courthouse.

21 16. The court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21168

22 and Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 (or in the alternative, pursuant to Public Resources Code

23 section 21168.5 and California Code of Civil Procedure section 1085).

24 17. This petition has been filed within 30 days of the filing and posting of the County's last
25 Notice of Determination approving the Project and the Final EIR, which was posted by the County

26 of San Bernardino's County Clerk, in accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167(c) and

27 Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14 ("CEQA Guidelines") section 15112(c)(1).

28

5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

18. Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by prior service of a

2 letter upon the County indicating their intent to file this petition. (Attachment "A" hereto.)

3 19. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this instant action and

4 have exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

5 Petitioners do not have a plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law because Petitioners and their

6 members will be irreparably harmed by the County's failure to comply with CEQA's environmental

7 review and mitigation requirements in approving the Final EIR for the Project and by the ensuing
8 environmental and public health consequences that will be caused by the construction and operation

9 of the Project, as approved.

10 IV. STATEMENT OF FACTS

11 A. Community and Environmental Setting

12 20. The Slover Distribution Center Project is a proposal for the construction and operation
13 of an industrial high cube/warehouse building, totaling 344,000 square feet and 45 feet high,
14 on 17.34 vacant acres in the unincorporated community of Bloomington in the County of San
15 Bernardino.
16 21. The Project site consists of five parcels, four of which are vacant and one parcel with a
17 single residence at the southwest corner of the property which is scheduled to be demolished.
18 The Project site is bounded by Slover Avenue on the north, Laurel Avenue to the west and
19 Locust Avenue to the east.
20| 22. The area to the immediate south of the Project site is populated with single-family
21 homes in residential zones. In fact, homes are located within approximately 50 feet from the
22 proposed development along Mindanao Street. The Project proposes a single row of
23 landscaping and a steel tubular fence along the southern Project boundary.
24 23. Single-family homes are also located to the west, north, and east, including within
25 approximately 175 feet across Locust Avenue to the east. Bloomington High School is located
26 within approximately 547 feet to the southwest of the site.
27 24. The Project will have a total of 224 automobile parking stalls and 49 truck dock doors
28 and 48 truck parking stalls. The Project's main access point (Driveway 2) will be on Slover

6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Avenue. Additional points of access will be on Laurel Avenue (Driveway 1) and Locust
2 Avenue (Driveway 3).
3 25. The Project site is subject to the Bloomington Community Plan, which is part of the
4 County of Riverside General Plan. Among other applicable policies, the Community Plan
5 states in Policy LU3.1. A. ii, that: "Industrial development shall generally be located south of
6 Hwy. 10 and north of Slover Avenue." The Project locates industrial development south of
7 Slover Avenue.
8 26. The Project includes the certification of Final Environmental Impact Report (PEN17-
9 0145) and the following land use approvals:
10 a) General Plan Amendment to change the existing land use designation from
11 Bloomington/Residential with a 20,000-acre minimum lot size, additional
12 agricultural overlay (BL/RS-20M-AA), and Bloomington/Single Residential
13 with a 1-acre minimum lot size, additional agricultural overlay (BL/RS-1-
14 AA) to Bloomington/Community Industrial (BL/IC);
15 b) Conditional Use Permit (CUP) to construct a 344,000-square-foot-high-cube
16 industrial warehouse building, associated office facilities, and site
17 improvements; and,
18 c) Tentative Parcel Map to combine the five existing parcels into one lot.
19 B. CEQA Review and Project Approval
20 27. The County circulated a Notice of Preparation (NOP) of Draft Environmental Impact
21 Report ("Draft EIR") for the Project pursuant to CEQA on or about January 12, 2017.

22 28. The Project's Draft EIR pursuant to CEQA was circulated for public comment on

23 December 14, 2017.

24 29. The Project's Final EIR was made available in or about June 2018.

25 30. The Final EIR finds that the Project will result in significant and unavoidable impacts to

26 air quality and traffic/circulation.

27 31. On June 21, 2018, the County of San Bernardino Planning Commission held a public

28 hearing on the Project and voted to recommend that the Board of Supervisors approve the

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Project including certification of the Final EIR. Substantial public testimony was received at
2 the public hearing which lasted more than four hours.
3 32. On August 21, 2018, the County of San Bernardino Board of Supervisors held a public
4 hearing on the Project. The Board continued the hearing to allow for publication and mailing
5 of a corrected public hearing notice, and it closed the public hearing to those who spoke on
6 August 21 $t.
7 33. On September 25, 2018, the Board of Supervisors held a further public hearing on the
8 Project. At this meeting, the Board voted to approve the Project including certification of the
9 Final EIR.
10 34. The County's approval of the Project will cause Petitioners irreparable injury
11 for which Petitioners have no adequate remedy at law. Petitioners and their members will be
12 irreparably harmed by the County's actions in approving the Project. Petitioners were harmed
13 by, among other things, the failure of the County in its certification of the EIR to adequately
14 evaluate the potential impacts of the Project, and the County's approval of the Project without
15 providing adequate and effective mitigation measures contrary to the requirements of State
16 law.

17 35. The maintenance of this action is for the purpose of enforcing important public policies
18 of the State of California with respect to the protection of the environment under CEQA and
19 conformance with state law and local law. The maintenance and prosecution of this action will
20 confer a substantial benefit upon the public by protecting the public from environmental and

21 other harms alleged in this Petition. Petitioners are acting as private attorneys general to

22 enforce these public policies and prevent such harm.

23

24 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

25 (Violations of CEQA - Failure to Comply with CEQA's requirements - Code of Civil Procedure Section 1085, or 1094.5; Public Resources Section 21000 et seq.)
26
36.
27 Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate paragraphs I through 35 inclusive.
37.
28 CEQA requires the lead agency for a project to prepare an EIR that complies with the

8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

2 requirements of the statute. The lead agency must also provide for public review and comment on

3 the project and associated environmental documentation. An EIR must provide sufficient

4 environmental analysis such that decision-makers can intelligently consider environmental
consequences when acting on proposed projects.

5 38.

6 Respondents violated CEQA by certifying an EIR for the Project that is inadequate and fails
to comply with CEQA. Among other things, Respondents:

7 a.

8 Failed to adequately disclose or analyze the Projects significant impacts on the

S -6o environment, including, but not limited to, the Project's aesthetic, air quality, energy,
greenhouse gas emissions, land use, noise, and traffic impacts. By way of example,
the Project's EIR vastly understates the Project's air quality effects related to diesel
truck trips, where it relies upon unrealistic assumptions about the nature of Project

13 truck trips. By way of further example, the noise analysis omits important analysis

14 such as calculating the Project's nighttime noise levels, where the Project is expected

15 to operate 24 hours per day seven days per week. Again for example, the Project

16 patently conflicts with a number of policies contained in the Bloomington

17 Community Plan, and the Project fails to mitigate these significant effects.

18 b. Failed to consider cumulative impacts associated with other proposed logistics centers

19 in the area and failed to revise and recirculate the EIR in response to significant new

20 information that occurred after the release of the Projects draft EIR regarding the
newly proposed Project.

21 C.

22 Failed to adequately mitigate Project impacts, including, but not limited to, the failure

23 to adopt feasible air quality mitigation and the failure to adopt certain and enforceable
traffic mitigation.

24 d.

25 Failed to adopt feasible Project alternatives, and failed to make adequate findings

26 supported by substantial evidence that Project alternatives are infeasible within the
meaning of CEQA.

27 39.

28 As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by
certifying an EIR that does not comply with CEQA and by approving the Project in reliance thereon.

9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1

2 Accordingly, Respondents' certification of the EIR and approval of the Project must be set aside.
PRAYER FOR RELIEF

3 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as set forth below:

4 A.

5 For a writ of mandate or peremptory writ issued under the seal of this Court pursuant

6 to Code of Civil Procedure 1094.5 or in the alternative 1085, and directing the County and/or Does

1-20 inclusive to:

7 1. Void the Final EIR for the Project approval;

8 2.

60 Set aside and withdraw all approvals of the Project including but not limited
to the County's approval of the General Plan amendment and all related land
use approvals;

11 3.

12 Refrain from granting any further approvals for the Project until the County
fully with the requirements of CEQA.

13 B.

14 For a writ of mandate or peremptory writ issued under the seal of this Court pursuant

15 to Code of Civil Procedure 1094.5 or in the alternative 1085, and directing all Real Parties in Interest
and/or Roes 21-40 inclusive to:

16 I.

17 Refrain from constructing and operating the Project until the County complies

18 fully with the requirements of CEQA by voiding the approved Final EIR for

19 the Project, setting aside and withdrawing all approvals issued pursuant to that

20 document's review, and conducting a new environmental review process that

21 complies with CEQA's requirements as set forth herein.

C.

22 For Petitioners' fees and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expert

23 witness costs, as authorized by Code of Civil Procedure § 1021.5 and any other applicable
provisions of law. :

24 D.

25 For such other legal and equitable relief as this Court deems appropriate and just.
