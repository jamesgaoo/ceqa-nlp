RE: Notice to Attorney General of Commencement of Action against the City of Lincoln

To the Attorney General of the State of California:
Please take notice, under Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of
Civil Procedure section 388, that on January 12, 2018, Scheiber Ranch Properties, LP and Albert Scheiber filed a petition for writ of mandate under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"), against the City of Lincoln ("City") and Real Party in Interest Richland Developers, Inc. The petition challenges the City's December 12, 2017 certification of the Environmental
Impact Report and various land use approvals for the Village 5 project, a residential and
commercial development on approximately 4,775 acres located outside the City's city
limits, in its sphere of influence ("Project"). The lawsuit is based on violations of CEQA,
as discussed more fully in the Project's administrative and environmental review
proceedings. The exact nature of the allegations and relief sought is described in the
Petition for Writ of Mandate, and is attached to this notice as
Exhibit A.

Very truly yours,

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. Plaintiffs SCHEIBER RANCH PROPERTIES, LP and ALBERT SCHEIBER

3 (collectively, "Plaintiffs" or "Scheiber") petition this a court for a Writ of Mandate ("Petition"),

4 directed to Defendant CITY OF LINCOLN ("City") and Real Party in Interest RICHLAND

5 DEVELOPERS, INC. ("Real Party"). Plaintiffs challenge the City's December 12, 2017

6 certification of the Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") and various land use approvals for the

7 Village 5 project, a residential and commercial development on approximately 4,775 acres

8 located outside the City's city limits, in its sphere of influence ("Project").

9 2. In certifying the EIR and approving the Project, the City prejudicially abused its

10 discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law, including but not limited to its

11 failure to comply with the substantive and procedural mandates of the California Environmental

12 Quality Act ("CEQA"), the State CEQA Guidelines, Title 14, California Code of Regulations,
13 section 15000 et seq. ("CEQA Guidelines"), and other applicable regulations and policies.

14 3. The conclusions reached in the EIR are not supported by substantial evidence.

15 The EIR does not provide adequate analysis of, or identify adequate mitigation measures for, the

16 Project's individual and cumulative impacts, including but not limited to its impacts on

17 agricultural resources, biological resources, hydrology and water quality, water supply,

18 transportation and circulation, and human health impacts from air emissions.

19 4. Because the City's approval of the Project violates the requirements of CEQA, the

20 approval must be overturned. Therefore, Plaintiffs request that the Court direct the City to set

21 aside its actions to certify the EIR and approve the Project.

22 PARTIES

23 5. Plaintiff SCHEIBER RANCH PROPERTIES, LP is a California Limited
24 Partnership that owns and operates agricultural land within the boundaries of the Project.
25 Plaintiff ALBERT SCHEIBER (Mr. Scheiber") is a general partner of SCHEIBER RANCH
26 PROPERTIES, LP (collectively, "Plaintiffs"). Plaintiffs reside and engage in agricultural
27 activities on property they own within the boundaries of the Project. Plaintiffs' goal is to ensure
28 the long term viability of agriculture in Placer County and governmental compliance with

CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 CEQA and other laws of the State designed to protect the public and environment. The

2 Project's unanalyzed impacts will adversely affect the Plaintiffs' existing agricultural operations

3 as well as agricultural operations surrounding the Project. Plaintiffs are within the class of

4 persons beneficially interested in and aggrieved by the acts of the City and Real Party, as alleged

5 herein. Plaintiffs have a direct and substantial beneficial interest in ensuring that the City

6 complies with the laws relating to environmental protection, particularly CEQA, and Plaintiffs

7 are affected by the City's failure to prepare adequate environmental review of the Project.

8 Plaintiffs brings this petition on behalf of all others similarly situated that are too numerous to

9 be named and brought before this court as plaintiffs.

10 6. Defendant CITY OF LINCOLN ("City" or "Defendant") is a municipal

11 corporation, organized under the laws of the state of California, and exercising local government

12 power. The City is the CEQA "lead agency" for the Project. As lead agency for the Project, the

13 City is responsible for preparation of an environmental document that describes the Project and

14 its impacts, and, if necessary evaluates mitigation measures and/or alternatives to lessen or avoid

15 any significant environmental impacts.

16 7. Plaintiffs are unaware of the true names and capacities of Defendants DOES 1

17 through 10, and sue such respondents by fictitious names. Plaintiffs are informed and believe,

18 and on the basis of such information and belief allege, that the fictitiously named respondents

19 are also responsible for the actions described in this Petition. When the true identities and

20 capacities of these respondents have been determined, Plaintiffs will amend this Petition, with

21 leave of court if necessary, to insert such identities and capacities.

22 8. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that Real Party in Interest

23 RICHLAND DEVELOPERS, INC. is the applicant and proposed developer for the Project.

24 9. Plaintiffs are unaware of the true names and capacities of Real Parties in Interest,

25 DOES 11 through 50, and sue such real parties in interest by fictitious names. Plaintiffs are
26 informed and believe, and on the basis of such information and belief allege, that the fictitiously

27 named Real Parties are also directly and materially affected by the actions described in this

28 Petition. When the true identities and capacities of these Real Parties have been determined,

3 BACKGROUND FACTS

4 The Project and Its Impacts

5 10. The Project is located within unincorporated Placer County. Placer County has

6 embraced carrying its agricultural heritage into the future, having adopted a "right-to-farm"

7 ordinance providing in relevant part, "It is the declared policy of the County of Placer to

8 preserve, protect and encourage the development and improvement of its agricultural land for

9 the production of food and other agricultural products." (Placer County Code, § 5.24.040.)

10 Consistent with Placer County's agricultural heritage, the area encompassing the Project consists

11 overwhelmingly of agricultural properties.

12 11. The Project represents typical suburban sprawl development that is more

13 appropriate for the 1970s than the 21st century. Of the 4,775 acres comprising the Project site,

14 approximately 3,640 acres, or 76.2 percent, is farmland that will ultimately be eliminated for the
15 Project. More than half of this farmland, or 2,002.95 acres, is admittedly "important farmland."

16 A significant amount of this farmland operates under existing Williamson Act contracts.

17 12. These thousands of acres of prime and important farmland would be destroyed in

18 favor of constructing approximately 8, 200 residential dwelling units and 4.6 million square feet

19 of commercial space. In addition to the direct elimination of this massive amount of farmland,
20 Placer County explains that the Project "overtly plans for incompatible uses (intensive

21 residential development and commercial agricultural production) in close proximity," which will

22 result in significant environmental impacts.

23 13. Consistent with an antiquated suburban sprawl model of development, the City

24 failed to require any meaningful transit planning with the Project. As Placer County notes, "The

25 Draft EIR does not include a transit service plan for the 5 Village 5 Specific Plan Area. A transit

26 plan for the area is considered to be a vital a element to a mobility package, in addition to

27 pedestrian, bicycle and NEV.. . Further, the Specific Plan documents are absent any mention of

28 future transit to the Specific Plan area."

SOLURI
MESERVE 4
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 14. As recognized by Placer County, the Project's planning ignores transit in favor of

2 reliance on automobile circulation. The EIR correctly notes that the Project will trigger the need

3 for extensive improvements to roadway facilities throughout the area, and relies heavily as

4 mitigation on so-called "fair share" financial contributions by the Project.

5 15. Despite Placer County's repeated requests, the City refused to disclose in the EIR

6 the Project's "fair share" contributions to various roadway improvements, either in terms of an

7 estimated dollar number or even percentage of overall cost. As a result, the decision makers and

8 the public do not have adequate information available to determine whether the Project's "fair

9 share" contributions are likely to result in actual construction of the many identified

10 transportation improvements mitigating the Project's transportation impacts. The effectiveness

11 of the City's "fair share" mitigation strategy is unassessed and undisclosed.

12 16. Consistent with attempts to construct suburban development in existing rural

13 areas, water supply for the Project is speculative at best and, at worst, completely inadequate

14 often described as "paper water" that will negatively impact existing active agricultural

15 operations relying on such water. Although the EIR claims that surface water supplies from

16 Placer County Water Agency and/or Nevada Irrigation District are more than adequate to supply

17 the Project, neither agency provided, nor can they, written confirmation that they will be able to

18 provide water necessary for buildout of the Project.

19 17. In light of the Project's questionable surface water supplies, the EIR claims that

20 water supply for the Project will purportedly consist of a combination of surface and ground

21 water. However, the City and Real Party have made shifting and inconsistent representations
22 regarding Project water supplies throughout the City's administrative review process.

23 18. Since surface water supplies are inadequate, the Project includes as a component
24 the City's construction of six (6) new city-operated ground water wells to supply the Project in

25 addition to the City's existing five (5) wells. Thus, one critical element of the Project is to more

26 than double the City's ground water extraction wells. And yet, the EIR fails to demonstrate the

27 City's right to pump additional ground water and in fact indicates the City has no additional

28 rights to pump ground water.

SOLURi
MESERVE 5
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

•
19. In an attempt to allay reasonable concerns that additional ground water extraction

2 will negatively impact ground water supplies, the City suggested that it would limit the Project's

3 ground water use to 10 percent, without any explanation to how that arbitrary percentage relates

4 to actual physical conditions or impacts. What is more, Real Party contradicted this

5 representation, asserting publicly that the Project's ground water supply would likely be 25

6 percent. Further, the EIR suggests that the Project might need to rely on ground water for up to

7 75 of its water supply during dry years in accordance with the City's prior practice, which in the

8 past has led to over pumping of the aquifer. This express reliance on ground water to serve the

9 Project is made in the context of the City's failure to adequately document baseline ground

10 water conditions.

11 20. It is now universally acknowledged that surface and ground water are not distinct

12 but rather connected hydrologically. For example, reducing the ground water table may reduce

13 surface flows; and similarly, reducing the flow of a river or stream may reduce ground water

14 recharge. Here, the Project proposes to pave over thousands of acres of prime farmland that

15 currently enable ground water recharge and, by extension, surface flows within both Auburn and

16 Markham Ravines. The EIR conclusively asserts that storm water basins proposed as elements
17 of the Project will enable ground water recharge at the same rate as the existing thousands of

18 acres of agricultural land within the boundaries of the Project. However, no study or analysis

19 whatsoever supports this bare assertion.

20 21. Through increased ground water pumping and reducing opportunity for ground

21 water recharge, the Project will result in reduced flows to both Auburn and Markham Ravines,

22 which provide habitat for both steelhead and chinook salmon. The EIR fails to adequately

23 document baseline conditions, much less analyze the Project's impact or identify all feasible
24 mitigation.

25 22. Similarly, the Project is predicted to result in construction activities within
26 streambeds within the jurisdiction of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife ("CDFW"),

27 a CEQA responsible agency for the project. In fact, the EIR's analysis of Project impacts to

28 salmon and steelhead is generally limited to construction impacts. As a CEQA responsible

SOLURI
MESERVE 6
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

agency with authority for issuing a streambed alteration agreement authorizing such activities,

2 the CDFW criticized the EIR's failure to document Project activities affecting streambeds,

3 aquatic and riparian habitats, stating, "The CEQA Analysis should state what, if any,

4 Department-jurisdictional features will be removed, disturbed, or otherwise altered by the

5 Project... The CEQA document should address direct (temporary and permanent), indirect, and

6 cumulative impacts expected to adversely affect biological resources."

7 23. CDFW also criticized the EIR's reliance on deferred mitigation for impacts to

8 biological resources. Rather than set forth specific mitigation, the EIR deferred such analysis

9 through reliance on future approvals or agreements with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the

10 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and CDFW. The CDFW explained that this approach is circular

11 logic: "The Department cannot issue Notice of Determination based on a CEQA document,

12 which in turn relies on the Agreement for mitigation; it is circular logic."

13 24. In addition to water supply and biological impacts, the Project will result in the

14 direct elimination of approximately 3,640 acres of prime and important farmland. Yet the EIR

15 fails to meaningfully mitigate for the loss of agricultural land based on the City's legally-flawed

16 position that it has no duty to mitigate for loss of agricultural land separate from how that land

17 supports biological resources. Thus, other feasible mitigation measures for loss of agricultural

18 land, independent from biological impacts, are ignored.

19 25. The City's flawed strategy for mitigating impacts is based on a "working draft"
20 habitat conservation plan, the Placer County Conservation Plan ("PCCP"), that is unapproved,

21 and indeed has not even been released for public review.

22 26. CDFW sharply criticized the City's reliance on the "working draft" PCCP as the

23 extent of the City's duty to mitigate, cxplaining: "Tt is also incorrect to assume that if the PCCP

24 iS adopted, the participation shall satisfy ALL mitigation requirements under CEQA."

25 Procedural History

26 27. The City released a notice of preparation ("NOP") for the Project in May of 2014.

27 The City received numerous comment letters raising concerns about the availability of water to
28 supply the Project, environmental impacts associated with water supply, impacts and mitigation

SOLURI
MESERVE 7
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

related to elimination of agricultural lands, compatibility issues associated with allowing urban

2 uses in close proximity to the remaining agricultural lands outside the Project area, and impacts

3 to biological resources, including wetlands and sensitive species.

4 28. The Draft Environmental Impact Report ("DEIR") was released on August 26,

5 2016, for the statutory minimum 45-day public comment period that ended on October 11, 2016.

6 CDFW identified numerous deficiencies in the DEIR's analysis and mitigation of biological

7 impacts. The Placer County Air Pollution Control District ("PCAPCD") raised concerns about

8 the DEIR's analysis and unsupported finding regarding the potential health risk impact to future

9 sensitive receptors within the Project due to emissions of toxic air contaminants, and
10 recommended mitigation measures to address the impact that the City rejected. Placer County,

11 the City Open Space Committee and California Farm Bureau Federation submitted comments

12 regarding the DEIR's failure to set forth adequate mitigation for agricultural impacts. Plaintiffs

13 also submitted public comments in these areas.

14 29. The City released a Final EIR on July 19, 2017. The Final EIR failed to respond

15 in good faith to public comments made by Placer County, CDFW, PCAPCD, the City Open

16 Space Committee, California Farm Bureau Federation and Plaintiff's. Plaintiffs submitted

17 extensive comments detailing how the Final EIR's responses to comments were inadequate and,

18 in fact, reinforced the flaws in the DEIR's analyses.

19 30. On December 12, 2017, the City's City Council certified the EIR and approved the
20 Project. The City filed a Notice of Determination ("NOD") on December 14, 2017.

21 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

22 31. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to

23 Code of Civil Proccdurc sections 1085 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21167,

24 21168 and 21168.5.

25 32. Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the State of

26 California in and for the County of Placer pursuant to section 394 of the Code of Civil

27 Procedure.

28 33. This Petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section

SOLURI
MESERVE 8
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 21167, subdivision (c). The City filed a NOD for the Project on December 14, 2017.

2 34. Plaintiffs have complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 in serving

3 notice of this action to the City on January 12, 2018. (Exhibit 1).

4 STANDING

5 35. Plaintiffs have standing to assert the claims alleged in this Petition because it is

6 beneficially interested in this matter, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1086.

7 Plaintiffs live, work, and/or conduct business within unincorporated Placer County and will be

8 directly impacted by the Project. Unless the relief requested herein is granted, the environment

9 will be adversely affected and injured by the City's failure to comply with CEQA in approving
10 the Project and certifying the EIR.

11 36. Plaintiffs also actively participated in the administrative process conducted by the

12 City to determine the Project's environmental impacts and to ensure the City complied with

13 CEQA and all other applicable laws in processing the application for the Project.

14 IRREPARABLE HARM

15 37. The City's failures, set forth in this Petition, constitute a prejudicial abuse of

16 discretion within the meaning of the Code of Civil Procedure and CEQA. (See Code Civ. Proc.,

17 §§ 1085, 1094.5; Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21168, 21168.5.)

18 38. Plaintiffs have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.

19 If the City's actions regarding the Project are effectuated, Plaintiffs and the environment will be
20 irreparably harmed. No money damages could adequately compensate for that harm.

21 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE

22 39. Plaintiffs bring this action as a private attorney general pursuant to Code of Civil

23 Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important rights

24 affecting the public interest.

25 40. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a significant benefit on

26 the general public by requiring the City to carry out their duties under CEQA before approving

27 the Project.

28

SOLURI
MESERVE 9

CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

4 41.

2 Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will also result in the enforcement

3 of important rights affecting the public interest by compelling the City to engage in a fair, a

4 objective, and legally adequate analysis of the Project's environmental impacts, and to ensure

5 that the public has a meaningful opportunity to review and comment on these impacts and
mitigation measures for that Project.

6 REQUEST TO PREPARE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD

7 42.

8 Plaintiffs elect to prepare the administrative record in this action pursuant to
Public Resources Code, section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2).

q FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

10 Violations of CEQA

11 (Public Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)

12 43.

13 Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in
Paragraphs 1 through 42 as though fully set forth herein.

14 44.

15 The City prejudicially abused its discretion in certifying the EIR. The City did not

16 proceed in the manner required by law and its decisions in approving the Project and certifying

17 the EIR are not supported by substantial evidence. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21168.5; Vineyard

18 Area Citizens for Responsible Growth v. City of Rancho Cordova (2007) 40 Cal.4th 412, 426.)
These legal deficiencies include, without limitation, the following:

19

20 45. The Project Description Is Vague, Incomplete, and Unstable

21 CEQA requires that an EIR include an accurate project description, and that the

22 nature and objective of a project be fully disclosed and fairly evaluated in an EIR. (San Joaquin

23 Raptor Rescue Center v. County of Merced (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 646, 655.) An EIR should

24 contain a "sufficient degrce of analysis to provide decision-makers with information which
enables them to make a decision which intelligently takes account of environmental
25 consequences." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15151.)

26 46.

27 The EIR's project description is deficient because numerous details of the

28 proposed Project are missing, inconsistent, or shifting throughout the administrative review
process, including, without limitation, the following:

SOLURI
MESERVE
A LaW 10

CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

a. The EIR claims that the proposed Agricultural Overlay Zone ("AG

2 Overlay*) allows existing agricultural uses to continue. However, the EIR fails to

3 explain what existing uses will continue, or what constitutes a "new" agricultural use that

4 would require a discretionary use permit from the City.

5 b. The EIR fails to explain the compensatory ratio used to mitigate for the

6 elimination of agricultural land.

7 C. The EIR provides a shifting and legally inadequate description of the

8 sources of water supply for the Project and the infrastructure necessary to supply that

o water.

10 d. The EIR provides inadequate description of those elements of the Project

11 requiring a streambed alteration agreement from CDFW.

12 The EIR Fails to Adequately Define the Project's Baseline

13 47. In order to determine whether a project's impacts will be significant, CEQA
14 requires lead agencies to compare the impact of a proposed project to the "physical

15 environmental conditions in the vicinity of the project, as they exist at the time the notice of
16 preparation is published." These conditions serve as the project's "baseline." (CEQA

17 Guidelines, § 15125.) The description of a project's baseline ensures that the public has "an
18 understanding of the significant effects of the proposed project and its alternatives." (CEQA
19 Guidelines, § 15125, subd. (a).) Accurately determining the baseline environmental conditions
20 is crucial to accurately evaluating a project's impact. (E.g., San Joaquin Raptor/Wildlife Rescue

21 Ctr. V. County of Stanislaus (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 713.)

22 48. The EIR's description of baseline conditions is alternatively incomplete and

23 inaccurate, infecting and invalidating the entirety of the EIR's environmental analysis. These
24 flaws include, without limitation, the following:

25 a. The EIR fails to adequately describe the City's, PCWA's and NID's water

26 rights in sufficient detail to allow a meaningful discussion of whether adequate supply

27 exists and the environmental impacts associated with supplying surface water to the

28 Project.

SOLURI
MESERVE 11
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 b. The EIR fails to adequately analyze and document existing ground water

2 conditions, including how susceptible the aquifer is to overdraft. In fact, the EIR

3 misleads the public by stating that ground water is stable when authoritative sources

4 provide that ground water levels in the area have been steadily declining over the past 40

5 years.

6 C. The EIR fails to adequately document and disclose the hydrologic

7 connection between ground water in the area and Auburn and Markham Ravines.

8 d. The EIR fails to adequately analyze and document the presence of special

9 status species and associated critical habitat in the area potentially impacted by the

10 Project.

11 The EIS/EIR Fails to Adequately Analyze Significant Environmental Impacts

12 49. CEQA requires that an EIR describe the proposed project's significant

13 environmental effects. Each must be revealed and fully analyzed in the EIR. (Pub. Resources

14 Code, § 21100, subd. (b), CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.2, subd. (a).)

15 50. The EIR fails to provide decision makers with sufficient analysis in numerous
16 respects including, without limitation, the following:

17 a. The EIR fails to adequately analyze and disclose the Project's impact on

18 loss of agricultural lands and production, including both direct conversion of agricultural

19 land and indirect interference with existing agricultural operations including the

20 prohibition on agricultural spraying, conflicts with Williamson Act contracts, and

21 cumulative agricultural impacts.

22 b. The EIR fails to adequately analyze whether water supplies exist to serve

23 the Project, including how those water supplies may be reduced as a result of global

24 climate change.

25 C. The EIR fails to adequately analyze the various environmental impacts

26 associated with supplying surface and ground water for the Project.

4 e. The EIR fails to adequately analyze the Project's impact on reducing

5 ground water recharge in the area.

6 f. The EIR fails to adequately analyze and disclose the Project's impacts on

7 biological resources, including wetlands, riparian areas, and substantial adverse impacts

8 on special status species and their habitat.

9 g. The EIR fails to adequately analyze and disclose the Project's impacts on

13 risk impacts resulting from exacerbating TAC emissions.

15 51. "An EIR shall describe feasible measures which could minimize significant

16 adverse impacts." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.4, subd. (a)(1).) An EIR may not defer the

17 formulation of mitigation measures to a future time, but mitigation measures may specify
18 performance standards that would mitigate significant effects and may be accomplished in more

19 than one specified way. "Impermissible deferral of mitigation measures occurs when an EIR

20 puts off analysis or orders a report without either setting standards or demonstrating how the
21 impact can be mitigated in the manner described in the EIR." (Preserve Wild Santee v. City of

22 Santee (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 260, 280-281.)

23 52. The EIR fails to set forth, and the City fails to adopt, all feasible mitigation

24 measures for significant impacts, including but not limited to the following:

25 a. Project-level and cumulative loss of agricultural lands and indirect impacts

26 to agricultural operations.

27 b. Biological impacts, due to the EIR's flawed assumption that compliance

28 with the "working draft" PCCP would satisfy all mitigation requirements under CEQA.

MESERVE 13
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 C. Operational air quality impacts associated with exacerbating TAC-related

2 health risks to sensitive receptors located within the Project.

3 d. Impacts associated with supplying water to the Project.

4 53. The EIS/EIR improperly defers analysis and formulation of mitigation measures.

5 For example:

6 a. The EIR improperly relies on an unapproved and undisclosed "working

7 draft" habitat conservation plan to mitigate for impacts to biological and agricultural

8 resources.

9 b. The EIR improperly relies on obtaining various future approvals and

10 agreements with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
11 and CDFW to mitigate various biological impacts.

12 C. The EIR improperly relies on merely obtaining a streambed alteration
13 agreement as mitigation for Project implementation actions requiring a streambed

14 alteration agreement.

15 d. The EIR fails to adequately disclose all information necessary to assess the

16 effectiveness of the Project's reliance on "fair share" mitigation for various transportation

17 impacts.

18 e. Since the City could not obtain firm written commitments from water

19 suppliers to provide water supply for the full Project, the City is instead deferring the

20 requisite analysis and commitment of water supply to future subdivision approvals.

21 Failure to Recirculate the EIR Due to Significant New Information

22 54. CEQA requires a lead agency to recirculate an EIR whenever the addition of
23 information, after the close of public comment, would deprive the public and public agencies

24 with the ability to comment "upon a substantial adverse environmental effect of the project or a

25 feasible way to mitigate or avoid such an effect (including a feasible project alternative) that the

26 project proponents have declined to implement." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15088.5, subd. (a);

27 Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n v Regents of Univ. of Cal. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 1112.) Plaintiffs

28 submitted comments demonstrating that: (a) the Project's agricultural impacts were more

SOLURI
MESERVE 14
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 significant than disclosed in the EIR, and (b) the EIR failed to identify feasible mitigation

2 measures for admittedly significant agricultural impacts, including measures that had been

3 adopted by other public agencies. The City violated CEQA by not recirculating the EIR upon

4 receipt of this information.

5 Failure to Adequately Respond to Comments

6 55. The FEIR offers conclusory statements, unsupported by specific reference to

7 explanatory information, that are insufficient to adhere to CEQA's public participation

8 requirements. (See CEQA Guidelines, § 15088, subd. (c); People v. County of Kern (1976) 62

9 Cal.App.3d 761.)

10 56. In particular, responses to comments including but not limited to Response A9-1,

11 A9-2, A9-3, A9-4, A9-5, A9-6, A9-7, A9-13, 11-3, 11-7, 11-11, 13-3, 13-6, 13-8, 13-9, 13-10,

12 13-11, 13-14, 13-23, 13-39, 13-40, 14-2, 14-3, 14-4, 14-5, 14-8, 14-914-11, 14-12, 14-13, 14-13,

13 14-14, 14-15, 14-16, 14-17, 14-18, 110-7, fail to meet CEQA standards for reasoned

14 consideration of public input.

15 Findings Not Supported By Substantial Evidence

16 57. The City's Findings violate the requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines.
17 For example, the Findings fail to identify the changes or alterations that are required to avoid or
18 substantially lessen the Project's significant environmental effects (CEQA Guidelines, §15091,

19 subd. (a)(1); the Findings are not supported by substantial evidence (CEQA Guidelines, §

20 15091, subd. (b).) These deficiencies include, but are not limited to, the following:
21 a. The City's finding that the Project's impact on important farmland is

22 unavoidable.

23 b. The City's finding that the Project's conflict with Williamson Act contracts

24 is less than significant without the need for any mitigation.

25 C. The City's finding that the Project's impact on farmland is less than

26 significant without the need for any mitigation.

27 d. The City's finding that the Project's cumulative impact on important
28 farmland is unavoidable.

3 f. The City's finding that roadway impacts are significant and unavoidable.

4 g. The City's finding that the Project's operational impact on TAC emissions

5 is less than significant with mitigation.

6 h. The City's statement of overriding considerations for the Project.

7 PRAYER

8 WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request the following relief and entry of judgment
9 as follows:

10 1. For an alternative and/or peremptory writ of mandate directing the City to:

11 (a) vacate and set aside certification of the Final EIR and approval of the

12 entitlements for the Project on the grounds that adequate CEQA compliance did not

13 precede those actions; and

14 (b) comply with CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines in any subsequent action

15 taken to consider approval of the Project.

16 2. For a temporary stay to prevent the City and Real Party from taking further actions
17 to implement or proceed with the Project during the pendency of this litigation and subsequent

18 to the Court's issuance of a peremptory writ;

19 3. For temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief to prevent the City

20 and Real Party from taking further actions to implement or proceed with the Project during the

21 pendency of this litigation and subsequent to the Court's issuance of a peremptory writ;

22 4. An order awarding Plaintiffs' attorneys' fees under Code of Civil Procedure

23 section 1021.5, Government Code section 800, and other applicable authority;

RE: Notice of Commencement of Action against the City of Lincoln

Dear Ms. Scanlon:

Please take notice, under Public Resources Code section 21167.5, that Scheiber
Ranch Properties, LP and Albert Scheiber intend to file a petition for writ of mandate under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code
section 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"), against the City of Lincoln ("City") and Real Party in
Interest Richland Developers, Inc. The petition challenges the City's December 12, 2017
certification of the Environmental Impact Report and various land use approvals for the Village 5 project, a residential and commercial development on approximately 4,775 acres located outside the City's city limits, in its sphere of influence ("Project"). The
lawsuit will be based on violations of CEQA, as discussed more fully in the Project's administrative and environmental review proccedings. The exact nature of the allegations and relief sought is described in the Petition for Writ of Mandate that Plaintiffs plan to file on January 12, 2018.

Very truly yours,
