PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

Petitioner and Plaintiff, ANGIOLA WATER DISTRICT, hereafter "Petitioner," brings this
Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief (*Petition") and alleges as

3 follows:

INTRODUCTION, PROJECT AND PARTIES

1. This Petition challenges pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act
6 ("CEQA"), and its implementing regulations [California Code of Regulations, Title 14, Chapter 3,
§ 15000 et seq.] ("CEQA Guidelines"), certain actions and determinations taken and made by
8 Respondent South Valley Water Banking Authority ("Respondent" or "SVWBA") on December
18, 2017, including approval of a large groundwater banking project to be constructed in Tulare
10|| County, California, nearby the Central Valley Project's Friant-Kern Canal ("FKC"), known as the
11 Modified Pixley Groundwater Banking Project ("Project"), based on its preparation of a Joint
12 Final Environmental Assessment'/Initial Study - Mitigated Negative Declaration? for the Project
13 ("EA/MND" or "Negative Declaration") instead of an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR")
14 pursuant to CEQA, which challenged actions and determinations are more particularly described
15 in Resolution No. 2017-02 (including Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program attached as
16 Attachment A thereto) adopted by SVWBA on December 18, 2017 and referenced and recorded in
17 the Notice of Determination ("NOD") filed with the Tulare County Clerk on December 19, 2017,

18 which NOD is attached as Exhibit "A" hereto and incorporated herein by this reference. The
19 NOD identifies the environmental document prepared for the Project and adopted by SVWBA as a
20 "Negative Declaration" and indicates that SVWBA adopted a mitigation reporting or monitoring
21 plan and made findings pursuant to the provisions of CEQA.

22 2. Petitioner petitions this Court for a judgment, writ of mandate and other appropriate
23 orders to, among other things, void, vacate and set aside the EA/MND or Negative Declaration
24 prepared and approved by Respondent, SVWBA, as lead agency, for the Project and directing the
25 SVWBA to prepare a legally sufficient EIR as required by CEQA. Petitioner also seeks by this

26 Petitioner is informed and believes that the United States Bureau of Reclamation as : federal entity proposing to 27 partially fund the Project acted as lead agency for the Project pursuant to the federal National Environmental Policy Act.
28 2 Petitioner is informed and believes that Appendix A to the EA/MND is A a CEQA - Initial Study Checklist.

71364.002 - 2-

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 Petition to void, vacate and set aside all discretionary approvals of and relating to the Project by
2 Respondent and by Real Parties in Interest and DOES 1-100, and the findings and mitigation
3 measures and Resolution No. 2017-02 including the Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting
Program relating to the Project, and to enjoin implementation of the Project unless and until
5 Respondent has prepared an EIR and/or otherwise complied with CEQA.
6 3. According to the December 18, 2017 Staff Report for the Project (*Staff Report"),
7 the Project groundwater bank includes the following facilities and activities:
(a) Recharge Basin facility of up to 800 acres and cessation of any active
9 agricultural activity (e.g., cultivated crops and orchards) within the basin facilities.
(b) A well field of 16 recovery wells within the Recharge Basin boundaries, for
11| return up to 30,000 acre-feet of groundwater to the FKC a year during dry years.
12 (c) A new up to 60-inch diameter FKC turnout.

13 (d) A 4.5 mile long, up to 60-inch diameter, bi-directional concrete main
14 pipeline from the new turnout on the FKC to the said Recharge Basin area and in-lieu service area
15 (described below).
16 (e) An approximate 2-acre pumping plant and regulating basin.
17 (f) Approximately 14 acres of grower turnouts, related control facilities,
18 connecting pipelines, and up to groundwater recovery wells within an approximately 3,500-acre
19 in-lieu service area.
20| 4. According to the same Staff Report, Project objectives include to "Provide a dry-
21 year supply to banking partners to prevent fallowing, crop loss, or municipal supply
22 reductions...." which dry-year supply would consist of groundwater pumped from the Project's 16
23 deep recovery wells and subsequently discharged into the FKC.
24 5. According to Table 2-1 of the EA/MND, potential Project banking participants
25| which would store and use water stored by the Project, include Central Valley Project Friant
26 Division and Cross Valley contractors and subcontractors, which include entities that provide
27 water to agricultural and/or municipal users, including cities, counties and irrigation districts.
28

71364.002

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

6. The Project would return stored water to banking partners by aggressively pumping
groundwater in dry years from newly constructed deep wells located in heavily subsidence-
impacted area of the overdrafted Tule Subbasin in Tulare County and discharging such
groundwater into the FKC, which will result in long-term substantial water quality degradation
5 (and associated impacts) for Petitioner and/or other downstream water users, including within the
6l boundaries of Arvin-Edison Water Storage District in Kern County, California, which has an
Intake Canal near the terminus of the FKC, because the net effect of this Project activity is to
8 replace exceptionally high quality FKC water stored in and flowing through Millerton Lake with
9| lesser quality (e.g., containing elevated levels of salts among other constituents of concern)
10 groundwater resulting in downstream salt accumulation and concentration sometimes referred to
11 as "salt loading" and associated potentially significant environmental impacts absent appropriate
12 mitigation.
13 7. Petitioner brings this action against SVWBA in its capacity as the CEQA Lead
14 Agency for the Project. Petitioner is informed and believes that SVWBA is presently, and at all
15 times relevant hereto has been, a public entity formed and existing pursuant to the California Joint
16 Exercise of Powers Act [Government Code § 6500 et seq.] and known as a Joint Powers Authority
17 or JPA. Petitioner is informed and believes that SVWBA's physical address and place of
18 business is located at 357 W. Olive Ave., Tipton, California, 93272, in Tulare County.
19 8. Petitioner is informed and believes that SVWBA was formed by its member
20 entities Delano-Earlimart Irrigation District ("DEID") and Pixley Irrigation District ("PID"), for
21 the purpose of developing, owning, operating, managing and maintaining the Project.
22 9. Petitioner is informed and believes that Real Party in Interest DEID is presently,
23 and at all times relevant hereto has been, a public entity known as a California a irrigation district
24 formed and existing pursuant to the California Irrigation District Law [Water Code § 20500 et
25 seq.] and a member entity of SVWBA, and DEID's boundaries are exclusively located in both
26 Tulare County and (northern) Kern County.
27 10. Petitioner is informed and believes that Real Party in Interest PID is presently, and
28 at all times relevant hereto has been, a public entity known as a California irrigation district

71364.002

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

formed and existing pursuant to the California Irrigation District Law [Water Code § 20500 et
seq.] and a member entity of SVWBA, and PID's boundaries are exclusively located in Tulare
County.

11. Petitioner is presently, and at all times relevant hereto has been, a public entity
5| known as California water district formed and existing pursuant to the California Water District
Law [commencing with Water Code § 34000 et seq.]. Petitioner is authorized to and brings this
action on behalf of itself and the landowners and water users within its boundaries consisting of
8 approximately 33,000 acres of farmland. Petitioner's boundaries are located exclusively within
9 the County of Kings and County of Tulare. Petitioner pumps and distributes for the benefit of its
10 agricultural landowners and water users groundwater from several wells overlying the same
11 overdrafted and subsidence-impacted groundwater subbasin, the Tule Groundwater Subbasin
12 number 5-22.13 as defined by the California Department of Water Resources Bulletin 118 ("Tule
13l Subbasin" or "Subbasin"), from which the Project would pump and discharge the groundwater
14 into the FKC. Petitioner is also a member of the Tri-County Water Authority, which is a
15 Groundwater Sustainability Agency (GSA) pursuant to the Sustainable Groundwater Management
16 Act (SGMA) that includes a portion of the Tule Subbasin, among other subbasins, within its area
17 of groundwater management. Petitioner also holds a licensed appropriative right for 5,370 acre-
18 feet per year on Dear Creek (California State Water Resources Control Board License ID 01676)
19| and its point of diversion is in the vicinity of and downstream from the Project.
20 12. Petitioner has submitted extensive comments on the EA/MND, including
21 comments dated May 16, 2017, which comments among other things detail Petitioner's concerns
22 about the adverse environmental effects of the Project including to water quality, groundwater,
23 agriculture and subsidence, and provided substantial evidence supporting the need for an EIR
24| including opinion from eminently qualified and credible experts.
25 13. Petitioner is beneficially interested in Respondent's compliance with its duties and
26 responsibilities under applicable laws, including CEQA, and in Respondent's performance of its
27 duties to apply all applicable laws and consider rationally and in good faith all record evidence in
28 deciding whether to approve public projects.

71364.002

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

14. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents, sued herein
2 as DOES 1-10, and Real Parties in Interest, sued herein as DOES 11-100, and therefore sues such
3| persons, entities and organizations by these fictitious names. Petitioner is informed and believes
that each of said DOES has or will make or issue a discretionary approval in relation to the Project
5 and/or otherwise has an interest in the Project or matters alleged in this action. When their true
6 identities and capacities have been determined, Petitioner will amend this Petition, with leave of
court if necessary, to insert such identities and capacities.
8 JURISDICTION AND VENUE
15. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged herein and this Petition is
authorized by and arises under Public Resources Code section 21168 and/or 21168.5 and Code of
11 Civil Procedure section 1085 and/or 1094.5 et seq., which authorizes an agency's approval of a
12 Project to be set aside if the agency has prejudicially abused its discretion. Abuse of discretion is
13 established if the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by CEQA or if the determination
14 or decision is not supported by substantial evidence.
15 16. Venue is appropriate in this Court in the County of Tulare pursuant to Code of
16 Civil Procedure section 393, because the Project will be constructed in said County and the
17 environmental effects of the Project and associated actions by Respondents and Real Parties in
18 Interest, including resulting potentially significant water quality degradation and/or subsidence
19 impacts, will be felt in said County where the Project will among other things pump groundwater
20 from the overdrafted Tule Subbasin.

21 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

22 17. Petitioner has performed or is excused from performing any and all conditions
23 precedent to filing the instant action and has exhausted any and all administrative remedies to the
24 extent required by law, including as required by Public Resources Code section 21177.
25 NOTICE

26 18. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
27 21167.5 in mailing a notice of commencement of this action to Respondent, prior to filing this

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

1| Petition, a copy of said notice and proof of service is attached as Exhibit "B" hereto and
2 incorporated herein by this reference.
19. Concurrent with the service of this Petition, Petitioner will serve on Respondent a
request for preparation of the administrative record relating to this action in accordance with the
5 requirements of CEQA, and more specifically, Public Resources code section 21167.6.
20. Petitioner will comply with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
7| 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 by mailing a copy of this Petition to the
8 Attorney General of the State of California,
ATTORNEYS' FEES
10l 21. Petitioner is entitled to recover attorneys' fees from Respondent and Real Parties in
11 Interest pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 because this action will, among other
12 things, confer a significant benefit on the general public and large class of persons, and the
13 necessity and burden of private enforcement makes an award of fees appropriate.
14 FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY OF PROJECT

15 22. Petitioner is informed and believe that, in March of 2016, SVWBA circulated the
16 South Valley Water Bank Authority Pixley Groundwater Banking Project joint Draft
17|| Environmental Assessment/Initial Study-Mitigated Negative Declaration ("First Draft EA/MND")
18 for public review and comment.

19 23, Petitioner timely provided written comments dated May 19, 2016, on the First
20 Draft EA/MND, which included objection to the First Draft EA/MND and the then proposed
21 iteration of the Project, request for preparation of an EIR, and articulation of various concerns
22 relating to the environmental effects of the Project including the First Draft EA/MND's lack of
23 adequate evaluation of Project groundwater pumping impacts to the Tule Subbasin including
24| subsidence.

25 24. Petitioner is informed and believes that, subsequently, in April of 2017, SVWBA
26 circulated a revised draft EA/MND ("Second Draft EA/MND") for public review and comment,
27 with certain modifications to the project described in the First Draft EA/MND.
28

71364.002 -7-

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

25. According to the Staff Report, the Project groundwater bank (as modified) includes
the following facilities and activities:
(a) Recharge Basin facility of up to 800 acres and cessation of any active agricultural
activity (e.g., cultivated crops and orchards) within the basin facilities.
(b) A well field of 16 recovery wells within the Recharge Basin boundaries, for return
up to 30,000 acre-feet of groundwater to the FKC a year during dry years.
(c) A new up to 60-inch diameter FKC turnout.
(d) A 4.5 mile long, up to 60-inch diameter, bi-directional concrete main pipeline from
the new turnout on the FKC to the said Recharge Basin area and in-lieu service area (described
10 below).
11 (e) An approximate 2-acre pumping plant and regulating basin.
12 (f) Approximately 14 acres of grower turnouts, related control facilities, connecting
13| pipelines, and up to 5 groundwater recovery wells within an approximately 3,500-acre in-lieu
14 service area,
15 (g) Petitioner timely provided written comments dated May 17, 2017, on the Second
16 Draft EA/MND, which included objection to the Second Draft EA/MND and the Project, request
17 for preparation of an EIR, and articulation and reiteration of various concerns relating to the
18 environmental effects of the Project including the Second Draft EA/MND's lack adequate
19 evaluation of Project groundwater pumping impacts to the Tule Subbasin including subsidence.
20 Petitioner's May 17, 2017 comment letter included a technical Memorandum prepared by Dr.
21 Kenneth D. Schmidt, a licensed geologist and hydrogeologist. In that Memorandum, Dr. Schmidt
22 concludes among other things that pumping in the vicinity of the proposed Project has resulted in
23 significant subsidence, even though east of the Corcoran Clay, and that the Second Draft
24 EA/MND's "lack of evaluating land subsidence due to recovery well pumping for the proposed
25 project is fatal flaw in the EA/MND. The only way this could be mitigated would be to have
26 much shallower recovery wells (less than 500 feet deep). This would require many more recovery
27 wells and result in more interference with existing wells in the area." Also included was Dr.
28

71364.002 - 8-

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

Schmidt's resume of extensive experience working for water resource agencies, including
2 agricultural water districts, relating to groundwater, water quality, subsidence and related matters.
(h) Petitioner in informed and believes that SVWBA subsequently caused to be
prepared and distributed a draft Response to Comments and draft final EA/MND ("Final Draft
5 EA/MND") and notice of public hearing scheduled to be held December 18, 2017, to consider
approval of the Project.
(i) Petitioner timely provided written comments dated December 17, 2017, on the
8 Final Draft EA/MND, which included objection to the Final Draft EA/MND and the Project,
9 request for preparation of an EIR, and articulation and reiteration of various concerns relating to
10 the environmental effects of the Project including the Final Draft EA/MND's lack adequate
11 evaluation of Project groundwater pumping impacts to the Tule Subbasin including subsidence.
12 Petitioner's December 17, 2017 comment letter includes another technical Memorandum prepared
13 by Dr. Kenneth D. Schmidt dated December 15, 2017. In that Memorandum, Dr. Schmidt
14 concludes that nothing in the responses to comments changes the conclusion he expressed in his
15 May 15, 2017 Memorandum, and among other things reiterates his conclusions that the Project
16 may or likely will result in potentially significant subsidence impacts notwithstanding the
17 Response to Comments, with which he disagrees:
18
"Overall Effect of the Project on Land Subsidence

20 This issue is discussed in Responses C-37 and C-38. The responders

21 continue to ignore the effect of drawdowns on land subsidence due to recovery well pumping. The response provided (Page C-43) is that there will be an overall
22 increase in groundwater storage and water levels….based on the ten percent 'leave behind' requirement. However, the drawdowns in deep recovery wells (as
23 proposed) during recovery episodes would be significant. The documents for the

24 project clearly state that there will be significant drawdowns. Because the project site is located within a subsidence area (as evidenced by the recent Friant-Kern
25 Canal surveying and other results), there is every reason to believe that irreversible land subsidence would occur due to deep recovery well pumping for the project.
26 This could occur even if more water is placed in storage then is withdrawn, because

27 subsidence can occur seasonally, irrespective of long-term water-level changes. Also, more water may not be recharged to the deep groundwater compared to the
28 pumpage from recovery wells from the deep groundwater. Thus the project will
exacerbate the existing subsidence problem.

71364.002

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

AMN Summary

The responders did not provide any new site-specific data, but rather tried to justify
their previous conclusion based on a regional evaluation. The most glaring of the
response is that for subsidence (on Pages C-43 and C-44). In response C-37, it was stated: 'No significant impact to ground subsidence will therefore result from the

0c Project'. This is an erroneous statement, that is not supported by any evidence. Rather, the responders believe (Page C-45) that the historical land subsidence in the area was caused by 'regional pumping and chronic water-level declines'. My experience indicates that significant land subsidence at a particular site is directly

10 related to pumping of the nearest deep wells to this site. This applies directly to the subsidence along the Friant-Kern Canal near Deer Creek. That is, pumping of the

11 closest deep wells to this area (ie, within a few miles) was responsible for most of

12 the subsidence. The proposed Pixley Water Bank is located relatively close to the area of maximum subsidence along the Friant-Kern Canal. The failure to evaluate

13 land subsidence remains a fatal flaw for the proposed project. In my opinion, the

14 project is likely to have significant subsidence impacts. Nothing in the responses changes the conclusions that were expressed in my memo of May 15, 2017."

15 (i)

16 Petitioner is informed and believes that on December 18, 2017, SVWBA approved

17 the final EA/MND and the Project, and on December 19, 2017 filed a NOD with respect to the

18 Project and associated actions with the Tulare County Clerk (Exhibit "A" hereto) and State
Clearinghouse.

19 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

20 Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act

21 (Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.)

(a)
22

23 Petitioner repeats, re-alleges, and incorporates herein by reference each and every
allegation of paragraph 1 through 29, inclusive, of this Petition.
(b) CEQA was enacted to require public agencies and decision-makers to document
24| and consider the environmental implications of their actions before formal decisions are made
25

26 (Public Resources Code §21002), and to "[e]nsure that the long-term protection of the

28 environment shall be the guiding criterion in public decisions" (Public Resources Code §
27 21001(d)). "CEQA was intended to be interpreted in such a manner as to afford the fullest
possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory authority." (14

71364.002 . 10 -

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

California Code of Regulations, (hereinafter cited as "CEQA Guidelines") §15003(f), citing
2 Friends of Mammoth v. Board of Supervisors (1972) 8 Cal.3d 247.) The overriding purpose of
3 CEQA is to ensure that agencies regulating activities that may affect the quality of the
environment give primary consideration to preventing environmental damage. CEQA is the
5 Legislature's declaration of policy that all necessary action be taken to protect, rehabilitate and
6 enhance the environmental quality of the state. (Save our Peninsula v. Monterey County Board of
7 Supervisors (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 99, 117, citing Laurel Heights Improvements Assn. V. Regents
8 of University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 373, 392; Public Resources Code § 21000.)
(c) The lead agency must identify all potentially significant impacts of the project, and
must therefore consider all the evidence in the administrative record, not just its initial study.
11 (Public Resources Code § 21080(c), (d), 21082.2.) CEQA Guidelines direct lead agencies to
12 conduct an Initial Study to "determine if the project may have a significant effect on the
13 environment." (CEQA Guidelines § 15063(a).) "All phases of the project planning,
14 implementation, and operation must be considered in the initial study.".(CEQA Guidelines §
15 15063(a)(1).) Besides the direct impacts, the lead agency must also consider reasonably
16 foreseeable indirect physical changes in the environment in the area in which significant effects
17 would occur, directly or indirectly. (See CEQA Guidelines § 15064(d) & § 15360, see also,
18 Laurel Heights Improvements Assn, supra, 47 Cal.3d at 392.)
19 (d) An indirect impact is a physical change in the environment, not immediately related
20| to the project in time or distance, but caused indirectly by the project and reasonably foresecable.
21 (CEQA Guidelines § 15064(d)(2) & § 15358(a)(2).) Indirect impacts to the environment caused
22 by a project's economic or social effects must be analyzed if they are "indirectly caused by the
23 project, are reasonably foreseeable, and are potentially significant." (CEQA Guidelines §
24 15064(d)-(e).) A lead agency may not limit environmental disclosure by ignoring the
25 development or other activity that will ultimately result from an initial approval. (City of Antioch
26| v. City Council (1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 1325 [emphasis added].) Preparing a proposed negative
27 declaration necessarily involves some degree of forecasting, and the lead agency "must use its best
28 efforts to find out and disclose all that it reasonably can." (CEQA Guidelines § 15144.) The

71364.002 -1.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

guidelines specifically require that an Initial Study must consider "all phases of project planning,
2 implementation, and operation." (CEQA Guidelines § 15063(a)(1).)
3 (e) Where the CEQA environmental process was procedurally or substantively
defective, reviewing courts may find prejudicial abuse of discretion even if proper adherence to
CEQA mandates may a not have resulted in a different outcome. (Public Resources Code §
6 21005(a).) For example, the Court in Citizens to Preserve the Ojai v. County of Ventura (1985)
7 176 Cal.App.3d 421, 428, held that the certification of an EIR that had not adequately discussed
8| the environmental impacts of the project constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion even if strict
compliance with the mandates of CEQA would not have altered the outcome. The Court in
10 Resource Defense Fund v. LAFCO (1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 886, 897-98 [disapproved on other
11 grounds, Voice of the Wetlands v. State Water Resources Control Bd. (2011) 52 Cal 4th 499, 528-
12 29], went so far as to declare that failure to comply with CEQA procedural requirements was per
13 se prejudicial. The court in Kings County Farm Bureau v. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d
14 692 explained that an agency commits prejudicial error if "the failure to include relevant
15 information precludes informed decision making and informed public participation, thereby
16 thwarting the statutory goals of the EIR process." (221 Cal.App.3d at p. 712.)
17 (f) CEQA's environmental review process is intended to provide the public with
18 assurances that "the agency has, in fact, analyzed and considered the ecological implications of its
19 actions." (Laurel Heights Improvement Assn., supra, (1988) 47 Cal.3d at 392 [quoting No Oil,
20i Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 86.) The function of the environmental review,
21 then, is not merely to result in informed decision making on the part of the agency, it is also to
22 inform the public so they can respond to an action with which they disagree. (Id.)
23 (g) CEQA requires that an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") be prepared for any
24 project that may have a significant impact on the environment. (Public Resources Code §§ 21000,
25 21151.) CEQA establishes mandatory findings of significance that require the preparation of an
26 EIR when a project has the potential to substantially degrade the quality of the environment, to
27| achieve short-term environmental goals to the disadvantage of long-term environmental goals, and
28 when a project has possible environmental effects which are cumulatively considerable. (CEQA

71364.002 - 12 -

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

Guidelines.) Moreover, whenever an agency is presented with a fair argument based upon
substantial evidence that a project may have a significant effect on the environment, an EIR must
3 be prepared, even though there may be evidence to the contrary in the record. (CEQA Guidelines
§ 15064(f)(1); No Oil, Inc. v City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 85; County Sanitation Dist.
5 No. 2 v. County of Kern (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1544, 1579 ("County Sanitation").) California
6 courts routinely describe the fair a argument test as a low threshold requirement for the initial
preparation of an EIR that reflects a preference for resolving doubts in favor of environmental
8 review. (Ibid.) If substantial evidence establishes a "reasonable possibility" of a single significant
9 environmental impact, then the existence of contrary evidence in the administrative record is not
10 adequate to support a decision to dispense with an EIR. (Id. at 1580.)
11 (h) "The environmental review necessary to complete an EIR prepares the agency to
12 weigh the conflicting substantial evidence on each side of an issue and make its findings of fact."
13 (Ibid.) The fair argument test also requires preparation of an EIR where "there is substantial
14 evidence that any aspect of the project, either individually or cumulatively, may cause a significant
15 effect on the environment, regardless of whether the overall effect of the project is adverse or
16 beneficial...." (Id., quoting CEQA Guidelines, § 15063, subd. (b)(1).) "In other words, for
17 project that may cause both beneficial and adverse significant impacts on the environment,
18 preparation of an EIR is required because consideration of feasible alternatives and mitigation
19 measures might result in changes to the project that decrease its adverse impacts on California's
20 environment." (Id.) Thus, in County Sanitation, the Court of Appeal rejected the argument that
21 an EIR was not required because the net "overall" effect of the challenged ordinance project was
22 beneficial, even though there was a reasonable possibility of at least one significant effect. (Id.)
23 (i) Moreover, because CEQA defines the relevant geographical environment as the
24 area where physical conditions will be affected by the proposed project, in determining whether an
25 EIR is required, the area of project construction does not define the relevant environment for
26 purposes of CEQA when the project's environmental effects will be felt outside the project area.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

(j) Finally, under CEQA the lead agency bears the burden to investigate potential
environmental impacts, and if the lead agency "has failed to study an area of possible
3 environmental impact, a fair argument may be based on limited facts in the record." (County
Sanitation, 127 Cal.App.4th at p. 1597, citing Sundstrom v. County of Mendocino (1988) 202
5 Cal.App.3d 296,311.) "Deficiencies in the record may actually enlarge the scope of fair argument
61 by lending a logical possibility to wider range of inferences." (Ibid.)
(k) Respondent's actions in approving the EA/MND and adopting associated
8 mitigation measures and findings, approving the Project, and determining that the Project will not
9 have a significant impact on the environment, as recorded in the NOD attached hereto as Exhibit
10 "A," constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion in that Respondent failed to proceed in the manner
11 required by law and made findings, determinations, conclusions, evaluations, reports and
12 Responses to Comments not supported by substantial evidence.
13 Failure to Prepare an EIR for the Project
14 (a) The Negative Declaration contains substantial evidence, as well as a lack of study
15 of certain areas of impact including areas outside the Project construction site where
16 environmental impacts will also be felt thereby lending logical plausibility to a wider range of
17 inferences, and during the public review period on the proposed Project and prior to and/or at the
18 public hearing held on December 18, 2017, Petitioner and other agencies, interested groups, and
19 individuals including experts submitted into the record additional substantial evidence, upon
20 which it can be fairly argued based upon the whole of the record that the Project may have a
21 significant impact on the environment and that an EIR should and must be prepared, including but
22 not limited to the aforementioned written comments submitted by Petitioner and the following
23 substantial evidence:
24 (b) A mitigated negative declaration is not appropriate unless the mitigation will
25 mitigate any effect to a point of where "clearly" no significant effect would occur. (CEQA
26 Guidelines § 15070(b)(1).) However, the analysis and conclusions in the EA/MND that
27 notwithstanding mitigation the impacts of Project groundwater pumping and recovery on
28 surrounding pumpers and wells may exceed the standards of significant contained in the EA/MND

71364.002 . 14-

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

constitute substantial evidence that at least short-term significant environmental effects on
2 groundwater levels and surrounding pumpers are a reasonable possibility (with or without the
3 mitigation).
(c) The EA/MND utilizes as a standard of significance for agricultural resource
impacts any conversion of "Prime Farmland, Unique Farmland, or Farmland of Statewide
Importance (Farmland), as shown on maps prepared pursuant to the Farmland and Monitoring
7 Program of the California Resources Agency, to a non-agricultural use," and then concedes that
8 the Project will convert 800 acres of such Farmland to non-agricultural use as recharge basins,
9 which is substantial evidence the Project will cause significant impacts to agricultural resources by
10 the EA/MND's as judged by its own standard of significance, notwithstanding the Negative
11 Declaration's attempt to argue that recharge basins are compatible with and will be used to
12 support solely agricultural uses (different questions) which arguments are not supported by
13 substantial evidence because the evidence in the record clearly indicates the recharge basins will
14| potentially be used to store water for non-agricultural, municipal water suppliers including cities
15 and counties.

16 (d) Substantial evidence in various comment letters, including the comment letters and
17 enclosures submitted by or on behalf of the following agricultural water agencies, Arvin-Edison
18 Water Storage District on May 16, 2017, and May 19, 2016, Angiola Water District on May 16,
19 2017, and May 19, 2016, Shafter-Wasco Irrigation District on May 16, 2017, and October 6, 2017,

21 including in memoranda dated May 15, May 16, and December 15, 2017, and expert opinion from
22 others, and comment letters submitted on behalf of Los Alisos Ranch Company LLC and
23 McAland Ranch LLC, dated May 11, 2017, that there is at least a reasonable possibility that the
24 Project will or may result in one or more significant impacts, including the following:
25l (e) Land subsidence impacts including to public facilities such as the FKC and the
26 overdrafted Tule Subbasin, which has already been significantly impacted by subsidence from
27 groundwater pumping near the Project's recovery wells as documented in studies prepared by
28 several credible sources including NASA, Caltrans, USGS and Reclamation itself;

71364.002 . 15.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

(f) Surface water and groundwater quality impacts, including impacts to Petitioner
and/or other downstream users of high pH or salty groundwater pumped into the FKC by the
3 Project which will degrade their existing exceptionally high quality CVP supplies (contracted for
and stored in Millerton Lake) and cause delivery of such degraded water resulting in accumulation
5| and concentration of toxic salts and other constituents of concern that will lead to long-term
6 substantial degradation of water supplies downstream and potentially significant adverse impacts
to sensitive crops dependent on the continued delivery of such CVP supplies for irrigation and
8 conversion of Farmland to non-agricultural uses;
(g) Groundwater-level interference to surrounding wells resulting in loss of supply and
10 other associated potentially significant environmental impacts; and
11 (h) Discharge of new greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), contrary to the applicable
12 scoping plan of the California Air Resource Board and California GHG reduction policies, goals,
13 measures and targets, existing at the time of approval of the Project.
14 (i) Failure and refusal, despite repeated requests by public agencies to study various areas
15 of potential Project impacts including those related to the 2008 WQ Policy and other areas of
16 controversy that have been swept under the rug, including but not limited to potentially significant
17 direct and cumulative:

18 (i) Subsidence impacts and associated study of relevant subsurface geologic
19 and other important conditions, as noted by Dr. Schmidt;
20

21 (ii) Water quality impacts that will be felt outside the Project area arising from

22 aggressive pumping of Project wells from the overdrafted Tule Subbasin during dry periods and

23 discharging lesser quality, salty groundwater into the FKC (without compliance with irrigation

24 suitability standards which Reclamation's currently-existing decade-old 2008 WQ Policy does not

25 cover) as a replacement for exceptionally high quality Millerton Lake water and how that will

26 affect crops and groundwater basin salt balances downstream; and

27 (iii) Other impacts including impacts associated with where Project water will

28 reasonably foreseeably be used, including urban areas and new urban and agricultural

developments (e.g., growth-inducing impacts), each and all which failures as provided in County
Sanitation, supra, enlarge the scope of the fair argument and Petitioner contends gives rise to
3. plausible inferences that the Project may have one or more potentially significant impacts on the
environment that should be addressed in an EIR, as it is a common sense principle of CEQA that a
5 lead agency cannot hide behind its own failure to gather data.
Disagreement Amongst Experts Requires or Bolsters the Fair Argument
In Favor of Preparation of an EIR

(a) Even if it were not clear that there is substantial evidence in the record that the
9 Project may have a significant effect on the environment, the lead agency is to be guided by the
10 following principle: If there is disagreement among expert opinion supported by facts over the
11 significance of an effect on the environment, the Lead Agency shall treat the effect as significant
12 and shall prepare an EIR. (CEQA Guidelines § 15064(g).) As detailed above, Dr. Schmidt
13 prepared memoranda expressing the opinion that the Project may result in several significant
14| adverse impacts, including water quality and subsidence, supported by facts and literature.
15 (Response to Comments, Comments B-36 through 40, C-11, C-31, C-37 through C40.) The
16 Response to Comments disagree with Dr. Schmidt's subsidence opinions without further contrary
17 factual evidence or subsidence analysis - relying on the premise that subsidence will not be a

18 problem "overall" because the Project will result in a net increase in groundwater levels.
19 (Response to Comments, Response C-37.) As explained above, however, this is not an
20l appropriate standard and is an attempt to sweep the problem under the rug because at a minimum a
21 it ignores actual short-term subsidence impacts that will occur during dry-year or multiple dry-
22| year pumping cycles. It is illogical and unsupported by substantial evidence in the record that
23 subsidence may not occur simply because over the "long-term" there will be more water put in the
24| ground than is pumped out no matter how aggressively or how long the drought pumping cycle
25 is. Not surprisingly, nothing in the Responses to Comments changes Dr. Schmidt's opinion, for
26 reasons explained in Dr. Schmidt's December 15, 2017 memorandum which is part of the record.
27 Furthermore, there was other expert opinion supported by facts of potentially significant impacts,
28| including impacts of water quality degraded by the Project and like projects on the environment

71364.002 17-

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

including agricultural resources, including opinion from managers of large agricultural water
2 districts. The Response to Comments acknowledges the Project's water quality impacts, but
3 claims they are not significant on the basis of the 2008 WQ Policy and that "Reclamation reserves
4  the right to determine what constitutes substantial degradation." (Response to Comments,
5 Response B-36.) Accordingly, at a minimum, there remains a disagreement amongst experts
6 | about whether the Project may cause significant subsidence and other effects, including water
level and water quality effects, and an EIR must be prepared to assess that disagreement over
8 some very important environmental issues in the subsidence-prone area where the Project wells
will be located where others pump groundwater and will be significantly affected by the Project,
10 including downstream surface and groundwater degradation (which has not been studied and may
11 not be rendered insignificant by Reclamation's water quality standards, whatever they may be).

13 Inadeguate Description of Whole of the Action/Project,

14 Failure to Adequately Consider Relevant Environmental Setting, Failure to Adequately
Study Full Range of Project Impacts, and Inadequate Mitigation
15

16 (a) A project description must be accurate and complete in order to determine the

17 proper scope of environmental review. (County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71

18 Cal.App.3d 185, 192-93.) An accurate and complete project description is essential. (Ibid.) This

191 requirement reflects CEQA's definition of a "project" as "the whole of an action" that may result

20 in either a direct or reasonably foreseeable indirect change in the physical environment. (CEQA

21 Guidelines § 15378; Banning Ranch Conservancy v. City of Newport Beach (2012) 211

22 Cal.App.4th 1209, 1220, (*Banning Ranch").) If the CEQA document's description of the project

23 fails to discuss the complete project, then the environmental analysis will reflect that inadequacy.

24 (See Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. V. Regents of University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d

25 376, 403-04 ("Laurel Heights I"). Thus, a lead agency may not split or piecemeal a single large

26 project into small pieces to avoid environmental review of the entire action. (Bozung v. LAFCO

27 (1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 283-84 (CEQA mandates that "environmental considerations do not

28 become submerged by chopping a large project into many little ones . . . ."); Laurel Heights

Improvement Assn., supra, 47 Cal.3d at p. 396 [quoting Bozung] ("Laurel Heights II"); Orinda
2 Assn v. Board of Supervisors (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 1145, 1172.)
(b) The EA/MND's Project description results in a piecemealed review of the whole of
the actions necessary to operate and otherwise carry out the Project and fails to evaluate a proper
5 baseline and the full environmental impacts of the Project (including its operation and use), which
6 also leads to an inadequate analysis of ways to mitigate those impacts, among other deficiencies.
7 The Project proposes to recharge and recover up to 45,000 AF and 30,000 AF annually,
respectively. A key objective of the Project is to improve water supply reliability. The EA/MND
9 includes Table 2-1, which discloses the Project's potential banking participants consisting of
10 agricultural and urban water purveyors and users including several cities and counties. However,
11 the EA/MND fails to evaluate all the details and impacts of such activities, including potential
12| direct, indirect and cumulative growth-inducing impacts due to additional supplies and improved
13 water supply reliability resulting from storage of additional water supplies in a groundwater bank
14 for later use, and associated environmental impacts that may be felt outside the Project area (which
15| baseline conditions must also be discussed and considered) including downstream impacts to and
16 baseline conditions within Arvin-Edison Water Storage District and Kern County including
17| groundwater quality. Contrary to CEQA, the EA/MND essentially limits study and evaluation of
18| impacts to the Project area, and omits evaluation of Project impacts that will be felt outside the
19 Project area. (County Sanitation, 127 Cal.App.4th at p. 1582 ["CEQA defines the relevant
20 geographical environment as the area where physical conditions will be affected by the proposed
21| project."], citing Public Resources Code § 21060.5.) Consequently, the project area does not
22 define the relevant environment for purposes of CEQA when a project's environmental effects will
23 be felt outside the project area."].) In addition to failing to properly describe the entire relevant
24 existing baseline or environmental setting and evaluate Project impacts in relation thereto,
25 including with respect to subsurface conditions and neighboring wells and downstream surface
26 and groundwater quality, the EA/MND also appears to impermissibly use a future baseline for
27 assessment or deferred assessment and understatement of such Project impacts without
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

compliance with Neighbors for Smart Rail v. Exposition Metro Line Const. Authority (2013) 57
2 Cal.4th 439, 455.
(c) Furthermore, because the entire recharge and recovery processes or activities,-
including where and how Project water will be used are integral to completion of the Project, the
EA/MND's failure to evaluate these processes and their impacts that may be felt outside the
6 Project site improperly attempts to evade a comprehensive environmental review of the whole
supra, 13 Cal.3d at 283-84.) A lead agency must "avoid minimizing" project. (See Bozung,
8| impacts and "must reflect a conscientious effort to provide . adequate and relevant detailed
9 information about [those impacts]." (San Franciscans for Reasonable Growth v. City and County
10 of San Francisco (1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 61, 79.) "[F]ailure to provide enough information to
11 permit informed decision-making is fatal." (Napa Citizens for Honest Government v. Napa
12 County Bd. of Supervisors (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 342, 361.) As mentioned above, "[a] public
13 agency is not permitted to subdivide a single project into smaller individual subprojects in order to
14 avoid the responsibility of considering the environmental impact of the project as a whole."
15 (Orinda Assn v. Board of Supervisors, supra, 182 Cal.App.3d at p. 1171.) Multiple activities are
16 within the scope of the same CEQA project where one activity is integral to the other. (Tuolumne
17 County Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. v. City of Sonora (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 1214,
18 1229; Sierra Club v. West Side Irr. Dist. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 690, 698 ("Courts have
19 considered separate activities as one CEQA project and required them to be reviewed together
20| where both activities are integral parts of the same project." (citation omitted).) While
21 "[t]echnical perfection is not required," an environmental analysis requires "adequacy,
22 completeness and a good-faith effort at full disclosure." (Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay
23 Committee v. Board of Port Com'rs (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1355 (quoting Rio Vista Farm
24 Bureau Center v. County of Solano (1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 351, 368).)
25 (d) Diverting recharge water to the Project facilities and recovering and delivering
26 water to Project participants and their end uses (agricultural and urban) of water stored by the
27 Project are integral to and a consequence of the Project's operation, and the SVWBA must analyze
28 the environmental impacts associated with both of those activities (recharge and recovery).

71364.002 - 20 -

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

However, the EA/MND fails to do so. While the EA/MND's lengthy response to comments
2 suggests that these impacts are speculative, sufficient detail is known or should be known about
3 the water quantities to be banked and withdrawn and reasonably foresecable users and uses of
4 Project water to discuss the places of use, the end uses, and potential environmental impacts
5 associated with obtaining and supplying water to those users and places of use. (See, e.g., City of
6 Antioch v. City Council (1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 1325, 1336 [EIR required "where significant
7 impacts were a realistic possibility, even though the exact form that development would take could
8 not be known']; CEQA Guidelines § 15064(d)(3).) The EA/MND's failure to study urban use of
9 Project banked supplies, in particular, renders the Project's evaluation of impacts, including
10 agricultural impacts and consistency with Williamson Act/Tulare County Agricultural Preserve
11 Uniform Rules flawed, because various analyses and impact conclusions are premised on the false
12 assumption that Project recharge ponds will exclusively be used to support the viability of
13 surrounding agricultural lands.
14 (e) "The foremost principle under CEQA is that the Legislature intended the act 'to be
15 interpreted in such manner as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within
16 the reasonable scope of the statutory language." (Laurel Heights I, 47 Cal.3d at p. 390.) CEQA
17 requires preparation of an environmental impact report (EIR) whenever a public agency proposes
18 to approve or to carry out a project that may have significant impacts on the environment. (Public
19 Resources Code §§ 21100, 21151.) "An EIR is an 'environmental "alarm bell" whose purpose it is
20| to alert the public and its responsible officials to environmental changes before they have reached
21 ccological points of no return.' "(47 Cal.3d at p. 392.) Whenever the record supports a fair
22 argument that the project "may" have a significant effect on the environment, an EIR must be
23 prepared. (County Sanitation, supra, 127 Cal.App.4th at p. 1579). The "fair argument" standard
24| presents a low threshold requirement for the initial preparation of an EIR, reflecting a "preference
25 for resolving doubts in favor of environmental review." (Ibid.)
26 (f) The EA/MND admits that before implementation of mitigation the Project may
27 cause "potentially significant interference effects" to nearby wells. (Response to Comments,
28 Response C-4.) The EA/MND attempts to justify the SVWBA's refusal to prepare an EIR by use

71364.002 - 21 -

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

of various mitigation measures. However, the mitigation measures are not sufficient to meet the
required standard for a mitigated negative declaration, because the mitigation will not be such that
3| "clearly" no significant impacts would occur. (CEQA Guidelines § 15064(f)(2); Response to
Comments, Response B-35.) This much is clear from mitigation measure (MM) WAT-3, which
concedes that Project operations could, notwithstanding that mitigation measure, for example, at
6| least cause short-term significant impacts, including pumping level declines in nearby wells to the
point of not only causing increased costs of pumping at greater depths by "Added Lift" to reach
8 lowered groundwater (id, Response to Comments, Response C-15), but also causing loss of
suction and dewatering of wells potentially resulting in the need to drill new wells or provide
10 replacement water. The mitigation measure also provides for installation of monitoring wells to
11 detect significant impacts. In addition to supplying the requisite substantial evidence of
12| reasonably possible significant impacts requiring preparation of an EIR, this mitigation highlights
13 some of the impacts that the EA/MND fails to evaluate including those associated with installing
14| new wells, providing replacement water, and the energy and associated impacts of well operators
15 having to use more energy to pump from greater depths. Moreover, the mitigation measures are
16 improper because they continue to defer formulation of mitigation, studies and protocols, and
17| because the SVWBA only may in its "discretion" decide to follow the advice or
18 "recommendations" of its hand-selected Technical Committee (if any) and minimize significant
19 adverse effects. Similarly, the EA/MND improperly uses Reclamation's 2008 WQ Policy as
20 mitigation, because among other deficiencies that policy does not include standards protective of
21 water quality for irrigation and Reclamation reserves the right to determine what constitutes
22 substantial degradation in the future without any performance standards.
23 (g) The EA/MND also attempts to justify not preparing an EIR by arguing that the
24 "overall" groundwater levels resulting from the Project will be higher or beneficial. (E.g.,
25 Response to Comments, C-11, p. C-19.) That, however, is an invalid argument because among
26

27 other deficiencies it ignores, contrary to CEQA, the Project's short-term potentially significant
impacts. (E.g., Neighbors for Smart Rail, supra. 57 Cal.4th 439, 455.) Clearly, groundwater
28 extraction may have significant impacts to adjacent wells and cause subsidence in recovery years

71364.002 - 22 -

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

or periods (e.g., drought years), even though "overall," depending on assumed hydrology, more
water might be deposited in than is withdrawn from the basin. (See memo by Dr. Kenneth D.
3 Schmidt dated December 15, 2017.) In addition, the SVWBA must also conduct an evaluation of
whether the Project risks exacerbating the condition of already existing subsidence - an
5 acknowledged severe hazard in the area of the Project. (Ibid.; California Bldg. Industry Assn. v.
6 Bay Area Air Quality Management Dist. (2015) 62 Cal.4th 369, 377-78.)

(h) The EA/MND also continues to refuse to conduct water quality anti-degradation
analysis, which will be required to obtain permits necessary to discharge non-CVP water, i.e.,
worse quality groundwater, into the high quality waters of the FKC, and evaluate the impacts
10 associated with providing others with degraded water including growers in Arvin-Edison Water
11 Storage District in Kern County. (Asociacion de Gente Unida por el Agua v. Central Valley
12 Regional Water Quality Control Bd. (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 1255, 1268; SWRCB Resolution No.
13 68-16.) The EA/MND essentially fails to do the required water quality study and analysis because
14 it says that the Project will comply with then-current Reclamation non-project pump-in standards
15 for the FKC, whatever they may be. There is no water degradation study, despite the fact that the
16 SVWBA has been provided comments that include a long list of projects that may contribute to
17 cumulative water quality impacts because they introduce non-project (i.e., non-CVP, groundwater,
18 California Aqueduct supply, etc.) into the FKC. While the Response to Comments claim that not
19 enough detail was provided, such response is basically a failure to hide behind the SVWBA's own
20 refusal to do the required study and obtain data. Furthermore, the EA/MND fails to discuss the
21 continuing controversy among FKC water contractors and users and Reclamation about whether
22 Reclamation's existing standards (Title 22) are sufficient to protect agricultural lands and water
23 users from significant impacts including salt loading a significant problem in Tulare Lake Basin.
24 (i) Moreover, the record is unduly limited due to failure to consider or evaluate certain
25 impacts, for example those that will be felt outside the Project area. An agency cannot hide
26 behind its own failure to gather data. There are likely many other potentially significant, inferable
27 environmental effects that have not been analyzed because of a decision to limit the analysis to the
28 Project area. The unduly truncated study area makes it even more likely that the SVWBA's

71364.002 - 23 -

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

failure to prepare an EIR violates CEQA. (See County Sanitation, supra, 127 Cal.App.4th at 1597
['"Deficiencies in the record may actually enlarge the scope of fair argument by lending a logical
3 plausibility a to a wider range of inferences."]).

Prejudicial Failure to Evaluate Project Alternatives and Mitigation

(a) The EA/MND does not evaluate a range of reasonable alternatives as required by
CEQA for an EIR. (CEQA Guidelines § 15126.6.) For example, the environmental document
does not consider alternative Project locations, recovery rates or amounts, pumping depths, or
water quality standards that could possibly avoid or mitigate potentially significant subsidence,
water level and water quality impacts. Moreover, the failure to adequately study the whole of the
10 action and associated impacts precluded SVWBA from considering alternatives or mitigation that
11 may reduce those unstudied impacts. In addition, the EA/MND improperly defers formulation of
12 mitigation and performance standards into the future, including Reclamation's future water quality
13 standards for discharge of non-project water into the FKC (if any), and improperly uses current
14 and prospective mitigation measures as a substitute for actual analysis of Project impacts including
15 impacts that will occur outside the Project area, contrary to the requirements of CEQA. (E.g., Pub.
16 Resources Code § 21060.5.)
17

181 Inadequate Cumulative Impact Analysis

19 (a) When assessing whether a cumulative effect requires an EIR, the lead agency shall

20 consider whether the cumulative impact is significant and whether the effects of the project are

21 cumulatively considerable. An EIR must be prepared if the cumulative impact may be significant

22l and the project's incremental effect, though individually limited, is cumulatively considerable.

23 "Cumulatively considerable" means that "the incremental effects of an individual project are

24 significant when viewed in connection with the effects of past projects, the effects of other current 25| projects, and the effects of probable future projects." (CEQA Guidelines § 15064(h).) The

26 EA/MND fails to follow these standards (at least for the whole of the action) and fails to consider

27 the cumulative impacts, including water quality, well drawdown and subsidence impacts, of past,

28 current and future probable projects, whether they may be significant, or whether the Project's

71364.002 - 24 -

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

contribution would be cumulatively considerable. The cursory two-paragraph discussion in the
2 CEQA Initial Study Checklist of the EA/MND (at Appendix A) is non-responsive to Checklist
3 question XVIII-(b) barely gives "lip service" related to the Checklist and is clearly analytically
inadequate. The only Project features specifically mentioned in the cumulative impact analysis are
recharge ponds, which the EA/MND itself admits are almost entirely passive and presumably less
6 likely to result in significant impacts that other Project components. The discussion fails to
adequately consider or evaluate the cumulative impacts of other less passive and likely more
8 impactful aspects of the Project such as groundwater pumping and cumulatively supplying FKC
9| users with worse quality replacement water (groundwater) over the course of decades. There is
10 also a failure to evaluate the Project's consistency with and contribution (or lack thereof) to
11 achievement of California's greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction goals and targets as described and
12 reflected in California's 2017 Climati Change Scoping Plan prepared by California Air Resources
13 Control Board, including the GHG reduction measures and amounts needed from the water sector
14 to achieve 2020, 2030 and 2050 reductions. (See, e.g., Cleveland National Forest Foundation v.
15 SANDAG (2017) 3 Cal.5th 497.) As provided above, these and other cumulative impacts must be
16 adequately studied in an EIR.
17 Prejudicial Failure to Recirculate the EA/MND and Extensive Response to Comments
18 for Public Review and Comment

19

201 (a) A lead agency is required to recirculate a negative declaration when it must be

21 substantially revised after public notice of its availability. (CEQA Guidelines § 15073.5(a).) The

22 final EA/MND augments the prior Second Draft EA/MND with substantial revisions, including
lengthy Responses to Comments (over 900 pages with comment letters). The Responses to
23

24 Comments admit that Mitigation Measure WAT-3 has been "refined and enhanced" to address

25 admittedly potentially significant intermittent and temporary well interference impacts. (Response

26 to Comments, Response C-4.) The Response to Comments also includes several pages of rather
extensive technical data and discussion relating to Dr. Schmidt and a memorandum prepared for
27

28 the "Apex Ranch Conjunctive Use Project," none of which were included in the EA/MND drafts

71364.002 - 25 -

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

made available during the statutorily-required public review and comment period. (Response to
Comments, pp. C-12 through C-14.) Without waiving Petitioner's position that an EIR is required
3 for the Project (CEQA Guidelines § 15073.5(d)), Petitioner contends that at a minimum the public
has the right to review and comment on these and other substantial revisions in the EA/MND and
5 the EA/MND, including Response to Comments and associated Staff Report, must be recirculated
6 for public review and comment. (CEQA Guidelines § 15073.5(b).)
(b) Respondent violated its duties under CEQA to prepare an EIR for any project it
8 intends to carry out that may have a significant adverse impact on the environment. Accordingly,
the approval of the EA/MND and the adoption of the Project must be set aside.

10 (c) Petitioner is informed and believes that Respondents and Real Parties in Interest are
11 threatening to carry out the Project in the near future and that the Project will irreparably harm the
12 environment by, among other things, adversely affecting agricultural resources including loss of
13 crops and Farmland, surface and groundwater quality, crops, alteration of the direction or rate of

14 flow of ground waters, reduction in groundwater levels, and causing further subsidence and
15| associated adverse environmental impacts. A temporary restraining order and preliminary and
16 permanent injunction should issue restraining Respondents and Real Parties in Interest from
17 carrying out the Project.
18 (d) Petitioner has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law
19 other than the relief sought in this petition.
20 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

24 (a) Petitioner repeats, re-alleges, and incorporates herein by reference each and every

25 allegation of paragraph 1 through 57, inclusive, of this Petition.

26 (b) An actual controversy exists between the parties. Petitioner contends that

27 Respondent and Real Parties in Interest have acted in violation of CEQA. Respondent and Real

Re: Notice of Commencement of Action Regarding Modifted Pixley
Groundwater Banking Project

Dear Mr. Brogan:
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that pursuant to California Public Resources Code section 21167.5 the Angiola Water District intends to commence an action by filing a Petition for Writ of Mandate ("Petition") in the Superior Court of Tulare County under the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code § 21000 ("CEQA") against the South Valley Water Banking Authority ("Respondent" or "Authority") as the CEQA lead agency with respect to its approval and/or adoption of a final Joint Final Environmental Assessment/Initial Study-Mitigated Negative Declaration (Mitigated Negative Declaration) (SCH # 2016031092) and approval of a project known as the Modified Pixley Groundwater Banking Project ("Project") on December 18, 2017, including adoption of Resolution No. 2017-02, all in violation of CEQA. The challenged actions are also described in a Notice of Determination filed with the Tulare County
Clerk by the Authority on December 19, 2017.
The Petition will allege, among other things, that the Authority failed to properly follow the procedures and requirements of CEQA in several ways including, but not limited to: failure to prepare an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the Project despite the existence of substantial evidence of a fair argument of one or more potentially significant environmental impacts (including but on limited to impacts from land subsidence, surface and groundwater quality impacts, and interference with surrounding wells); improper preparation of a Mitigated Negative Declaration; failure to analyze impacts outside of the Project area; and failure to adequately analyze cumulative impacts.
