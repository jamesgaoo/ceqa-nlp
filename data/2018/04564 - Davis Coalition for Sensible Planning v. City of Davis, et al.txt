Petitioner Davis Coalition for Sensible Planning (*Petitioner") seeks a writ of mandamus
2 against Respondent City of Davis ("City" or "Respondent") and alleges as follows:

3 INTRODUCTION

4 1. This petition challenges the City's February 6, 2018 decisions, and all subsequent
5 actions, in approving: an Addendum to a previously-certified Environmental Impact Report; a

6 General Plan Amendment; a Development Agreement; Prezoning and Preliminary Planned
7 Development; a Determination to place the project on the June 2018 ballot for voter
8 consideration under Measure R (Davis Municipal Code, §§ 41.01.010 et seq.); and other
9 associated entitlements (collectively "Entitlements"). These Entitlements purport to authorize a
10 revised development project known as the Nishi Residential Development Project' (the
11 "Revised Project"), which modified the previously-considered (and voter rejected) Nishi
12 Gateway Mixed-Use Innovation District (*Original Project"). The Revised Project includes
13 2,200 residential "beds" in approximately 700 two- and three-bedroom multifamily rental units,
14 up to 10,000 square feet of ancillary retail, and 700 vehicle spaces. The project site is located in
15 unincorporated Yolo County between the University of California at Davis and the Interstate 80,
16 and is approximately 47 acres of undeveloped land with an Agriculture land use designation (the
17 "Nishi Property").

18 2. Petitioner seeks a writ of mandamus invalidating the City's approval of the EIR
19 Addendum and invalidating and setting aside the Revised Project's Entitlements since, as more
20 fully set forth below, the City has violated the California Environmental Quality Act, the
21 Planning and Zoning law, the Davis Municipal Code, and other laws.
22 PARTIES

23 3. Petitioner Davis Coalition for Sensible Planning ("Petitioner') is an
24 unincorporated association whose members are residents of the City of Davis, California.
25 Petitioner's members include Susan Rainier, a Davis resident and California-licensed architect
26 with international design and construction experience. Ms. Rainier is Chair of AIA Central

9 Davis area, as well as for all residents in the County of Yolo, including all those who seek to

10 maintain sensible planning in the land use entitlement process.

11 Respondent the City of Davis ("City" or "Respondent") is a municipal

12 corporation, organized under the law of the state of California, and exercising local government

13 power. The City is the CEQA "lead agency" for the Project. As lead agency for the Project, the

14 City is responsible for preparation of an environmental document that describes the Revised

15 Project and its impacts, and, if necessary evaluates mitigation measures and/or alternatives to
lessen or avoid any significant environmental impacts. The Revised Project is within the City's
16 jurisdictional limits.

17 5.

18 Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Nishi Gateway,

19 LLC, named as a real party in interest ("Real Party"), is a California limited liability company
operating in California, to which the City granted some or all of the Project approvals.
20 Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Real Party holds all project
21 approvals granted by the City in this case.

22 6.

23 Petitioner is ignorant of the true names of respondents sued herein as Does 1

24 through 10, inclusive, and therefore sues them by those fictitious names. Petitioner will amend

25 the petition to alleged their true names and capacities if and when they are ascertained.

26 Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that each of these fictitiously-

27 named respondents is in some manner responsible for the wrongful conduct alleged in this
petition.

P JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2 7. The Court has jurisdiction over this matter in accordance with Code of Civil

3 Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5

4 8. Venue is proper in Yolo County in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure

5 section 394, subdivision (a), among others, because the Revised Project is located in Yolo

6 County.

7 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

8 9. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to this filing and participated in
9 the administrative process. Petitioner and its members actively participated in the administrative
10 process leading up to the City's approval of the Revised Project, and stated their objections to
11 the City's actions. (See Pub. Resources Code, § 21177, subd. (b).)
12 10. Petitioner and its members objected to Respondent's approval of the Revised
13 Project in writing prior to the City's approval of the Revised Project and adoption of the EIR
14 Addendum.

15 11. The grounds for noncompliance alleged in this Petition were presented to the City
16 orally and in writing prior to the close of the City's public hearing on the subject.
17 12. Respondent has taken final agency actions with respect to adopting the NOD and
18 approving the Revised Project.
19 13. Petitioner possesses no other remedy than to challenge the City's abuse of
20 discretion other than by means of this lawsuit.
21 STANDING

22 14. Respondent has mandatory duties to comply with CEQA before approving the
23 Project.

24 15. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because members
25 of Davis Coalition for Sensible Planning are residents of the City of Davis and have personal,
26 community and environmental interests that are directly and adversely affected by the City's
27 approval of the Revised Project and issuance of the Notice of Determination ("NOD"). As an
28 association composed of residents within the City, Petitioner is within the class of persons

beneficially interested in, and aggrieved by, the acts of Respondent as alleged below. Petitioner
2 and its members participated in the administrative processes herein, and exhausted their
3 remedies. Accordingly, Petitioner has standing to sue.

4 16. a Petitioner has a substantial interest in ensuring the Revised Project's impacts are
5 fully mitigated. Unless the relief requested herein is granted, Petitioner's environmental and

6 community interests will be adversely affected and injured by Respondent's failure to comply
7 with CEQA in approving the Revised Project.

8 17. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing this action, including
9 complying with the requirement of Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by providing notice
10 to the City that this action would be filed. (See Exhibit A attached.)

11 18. Petitioner will also serve a copy of this petition on the California Attorney General
12 as required by law.

13 IRREPARABLE HARM

14 19. The City's failures, set forth in this Petition, constitute a prejudicial abuse of
15 discretion within the meaning of the Code of Civil Procedure and CEQA. (See Code Civ. Proc.,
16 §§ 1085, 1094.5; Pub. Resources Code. §§ 21168, 21168.5.)
17 20. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.
18 If the City's actions regarding the Revised Project are effectuated, Petitioner and the

19 environment will be irreparably harmed. No money damages could adequately compensate for
20 that harm.

21 REQUEST TO PREPARE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD

22 21. Pursuant to Public Resources Code, section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2), Petitioner
23 elects to prepare the administrative record in this action.

24 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

25 22. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that the Nishi
26 Property has been maintained as agricultural land since at least 1870.
27 23. The Original Project proposed 1,920 "beds" in 650 multifamily residential units as
28 for-sale condominium units, 325,000 square feet of research and development or offices uses,

SOLURI 5
MESERVE
A LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE CORPORATION

1 and up to 20,000 square feet of accessory retail uses.

2 24. In 2015, the City had an Environmental Impact Report ("Original EIR") prepared

3 for the Original Project.

25. The Original EIR determined that the Original Project would have resulted in
5 significant and unavoidable environmental impacts to Agriculture, Air Quality, Greenhouse Gas

6 |Emissions, Noise, and Transportation.

7 26. The City certified the Original EIR on or about February 2016, and also approved

8 entitlements for the project including but not limited to a General Plan Amendment, Prezoning,

9 a Development Agreement, and a Determination to place the project on the ballot for voter
10 consideration under Measure R (Davis Municipal Code, §§ 41.01.010 et seq.).

11 27. Since the Original Project proposed to redesignate the Nishi Property from

12 Agriculture to a Mixed Use Innovation District land use designation, it required approval by an

13 affirmative majority vote of Davis voters under Measure R.

14 28. A majority of the Davis voters voted against the Original Project in June 2016,

15 which led to the entitlements being rescinded.

16 29. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on the basis alleges, that Real Party

17 revised the Original Project in 2017. The Revised Project omitted all 325,000 square feet of

18 research and development uses, increased the bed count associated with residential uses by
19 approximately 250, replaced the for-sale housing with rental units, and modified the site's
20 access such that primary access would be through a railroad undercrossing between UC Davis

21 and the Nishi Property.

22 30. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Real Party again

23 filed an application or applications that sought at least the following actions and approvals: (a)

24 an Addendum to the previously-certified EIR; (b) a General Plan Amendment redesignating the

25 Nishi Property from Agriculture to a Residential land use designation; (c) a Development

26 Agreement; (d) Prezoning and Preliminary Planned Development; (d) a Determination to place
27 the project on the June 2018 ballot for voter consideration under Measure R; and (e) other

28 approvals (collectively "Entitlements").

2 In January 2018, the City released the EIR Addendum (SCH # 201512066) in

3 which it determined that the Original EIR adequately assessed the impacts of the Revised

4 Project and that there were no changed circumstances or new information that would require

5 preparation of a subsequent or supplemental EIR, or recirculation of the Original EIR.
32.

6 Since the Original EIR was released, and prior to the release of the EIR

7 Addendum, new information became available and the circumstances surrounding the Revised

8 Project and under which the Revised Project would be implemented have changed, including but
not limited to:

9 a.

10 New related projects have been proposed that have the potential to

11 significantly impact Agricultural Resources in Davis and the County of Yolo.
b.

12 The addition of more residents to the Revised Project who would be

13 subjected to toxic air contaminants, diesel particulate matter, and ultrafine particulate matters in
levels that the Original EIR determined were significant.

14 C.

15 New information related to the inadequacy of Air Quality mitigation

16 measures since they do not require the installation of windows that cannot open.
d.

17 New information and changed circumstances with respect to Greenhouse

18 Gas Emissions, including but not limited to new California Supreme Court case law, new

19 statewide reductions targets imposed by the California Legislature, new statewide and regional
plans for achieving statewide targets, new natural disasters that impacts the state's ability to
20 achieve statewide targets, and new building code standards.
21 e.

22 New information and changed circumstances with respect to the Revised

23 Project's land use mix, which drastically alter the project's compliance with applicable plans,
including the City's General Plan and regional plans.
24 f.

25 New information and changed circumstances with respect to the Revised

26 Project's affordable housing proposal and the City's requirements on rental housing
development projects.

27 g.

28 The addition of more residents to the Revised Project that would be
subjected to noise disturbances in levels that the Original EIR determined were significant.

2 New information and changed circumstances with respect to Transportation

3 and Circulation, as the Revised Project now includes only one public vehicular access through
UC Davis, and the university is not legally bound to provide that access.

4 i. New information and changed circumstances with respect to new proposed
5 developments projects in Davis and Yolo County, which when considered in conjunction with

6

7 the Revised Project, have the potential to significantly impact all areas studied by the Original

EIR.

33. On January 24, 2018, the City's Planning Commission held a hearing a to consider
9 the Revised Project, and voted to recommend the City Council approve the Entitlements

10 requested by Real Party.

11 34.

12 On February 6, 2018, the City Council held a hearing to consider the Revised

13 Project, voted to approve the Entitlements, and acted to place the project on the June 2018 ballot
for voter consideration under Measure R.

14 35.

15 On or about February 7, 2018, the City filed a notice of determination stating that
on February 6, 2018, the City approved the Revised Project.

16 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

17

18 (Violation of CEQA: Failure to Prepare Supplemental or Subsequent EIR)

36.

19 Petitioner incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 35 above.

37. Public Resources Code section 21166 and CEQA Guidelines section 15162
20 provide that a supplemental or subsequent EIR must be prepared where: (i) the revised project
21

22 will create new significant impacts on the environment that were not previously identified, (ii)

23 the revised project will create a substantial increase in the severity of a previously identified

24 significant impact, or (iii) there is new information of substantial importance that was not

25 previously available, which shows a new significant impact, substantial increase in the severity

26 of previously identified significant impact, or mitigation measures that were not considered

27 would substantially reduce one or more significant effects on the environment.

38.

28 A lead agency's findings that a supplemental or subsequent EIR is unnecessary
must be supported by substantial evidence in the record.

MESERVE 8

A LAW
CORPORATION VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- 39.

2 The City's action in approving the EIR Addendum constitutes prejudicial abuse

3 of discretion in that the City failed to proceed in the manner required by law and failed to

4 support its decision with substantial evidence. Among other things, the City:

a.

5 Failed adequately to disclose, analyze, mitigate, and avoid the new

6 potentially significant impacts on Land Use and Planning and Transportation and Circulation,

7 which are a direct result of the changes made to the Revised Project.
b.

8 Failed adequately to disclose, analyze, mitigate, and avoid substantial

9 increases in the severity of previously identified significant impacts on Agriculture, Air Quality,

10 Greenhouse Gas Emissions, and Noise, which are a direct result of the changes made to the
Revised Project.

11 C.

12 Failed adequately to disclose, analyze, mitigate, and avoid new and

13 substantial increases in the severity of significant cumulative impacts on all areas based on new
information that was not previously available.

14 d.

15 Failed adequately to disclose and analyze new mitigation measures that

16 were not considered that would substantially reduce the severity of one or more significant

17 effects on the environment, including mitigation measures with respect to Air Quality.

e.

18 Failed to prepare and circulate a supplemental or subsequent EIR when

19 required under: Public Resources Code section 21166 and CEQA Guidelines section 15162,

20 which among other things deprived Petitioner and other interested individuals of their

21 opportunity to participate in formal public review and comment in accordance with CEQA

22 Guidelines sections 15162, subdivision (d) and 15163, subdivision (c).
40.

23 The City further violated CEQA by adopting findings that are inadequate as a

24 matter of law because they do not contain the findings required when approving a project based

25 on a supplemental or subsequent EIR, and because they are not supported by substantial
evidence in the record.

26 41. As a result of the foregoing defects, the City prejudicially abused its discretion by
27 proceeding with an EIR Addendum and approving the Revised Project in reliance thereon.
28 Accordingly, the City's determination that an EIR Addendum was appropriate, and approval of

SOLURI
MESERVE 9

CORPORATION VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 the Revised Project and all Revised Project approvals and Entitlements, which rely on the
defective EIR Addendum, must be set aside.

3 42.

4 Petitioner and other members of the general public will be irreparably harmed if

5 the relief requested herein is not granted and the Revised Project begins construction in the

6 absence of a supplemental or subsequent EIR and absent compliance with all other applicable
provisions of CEQA and other laws.

7 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

8 (Violation of Planning and Zoning Laws: General Plan Amendment and Consistency)
43.

10 44. Petitioner incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 42 above.

11 The City's General Plan is the constitution for all future development, and any

12 decision affecting land use and development must be consistent with it.
45. Actions inconsistent with the General Plan are void ab initio.

13 46.

14 The City prepared a General Plan consistency analysis for the Original Project

15 based on the project's then-proposed uses and project description.
47.

16 Real Party made substantial revisions to the Original Project such that the Revised

17 Project, for instance, omitted 325,000 square feet of research and developments uses, which
drastically revised the project's land uses.

18 48.

19 Real Party requested for the Revised Project a General Plan Amendment and other

20 entitlements and approvals that depend on General Plan consistency.
49.

21 The City did not adequately update its General Plan consistency analysis for the
Revised Project.

22 50.

23 The City approved the General Plan Amendment and other entitlements and
approvals that depend on General Plan consistency.
24 51.

25 By approving the Revised Project's General Plan Amendment and other

26 entitlements and approvals that depend on General Plan consistency without an updated and

27 adequate General Plan consistency analysis, the City acted arbitrarily, capriciously, and without
evidentiary support. Among other things:

28

SOLURI
MESERVE 10

CORPORATION VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 a. The Revised Project differs substantially from the Original Project and by
2 relying on an outdated consistency analysis, no substantial evidence supports any findings with
3 respect to General Plan consistency.
b. The Revised Project has specific mandatory and fundamental

5 inconsistencies with the policies of the General Plan that were not disclosed or analyzed.

6 C. The Revised Project does not implement or advance the goals of the

7 General Plan, which was not disclosed or analyzed.

8 52. For the foregoing reasons, the City has failed to proceed in accordance with law,
9 and Petitioner is entitled to issuance of a writ of mandate setting aside the General Plan
10 Amendment and all other entitlements and approvals that were issued in reliance on General

11 Plan consistency.

12 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

13 (Violation of the Affordable Housing Ordinance: Davis Municipal Code, § 18.05.060)
14 53. Petitioner incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 52 above.
15 54. Article 18.05 of the Davis Municipal Code provides the City's affordable housing
16 requirements (Davis Municipal Code, §§ 18.05.010-18.050-080, collectively "Existing
17 Affordable Ordinance").

18 55. Davis's Existing Affordable Ordinance provides that "General plan implementing
19 policies [] require that, to the extent feasible and subject to existing law, rental housing
20 developments ... with twenty or more units [provide] twenty-five percent of the units be
21 affordable to low income households and ten percent of the units be affordable to very low
22 income households . . . in perpetuity." (Davis Municipal Code, § 18.05.010, subdivision (g); see
23 also Davis Municipal Code, § 18.05.060 [requiring the same "to the maximum extent
24 feasible"].)

25 56. The Existing Affordable Ordinance does not permit affordable-housing-eligibility
26 restrictions based on whether an applicant is a student.

27 57. The first sentence of Davis Municipal Code section 18.05.060, subdivision (e),
28 provides that the "City acknowledges that the published appellate case of Palmer/Sixth Street

SOLURI 11
MESERVE
A LAW
CORPORATION VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 Properties, L.P. V. City of Los Angeles (2nd Dist. 2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1396 holds that the
Costa-Hawkins Act (Civil Code Section 1954.50 et seq.) precludes local governments from
3 requiring a developer to set affordable rent levels for private rental housing unless the developer
4

5 has agreed to such rental restrictions in exchange for financial assistance or other consideration
from the local government."

6 58.

7 However, the second sentence of Davis Municipal Code section 18.05.060,

8 subdivision (e), provides that "[t]his section shall be operative at such time that the Palmer case

9 is overturned, disapproved or depublished by a court of competent jurisdiction, or the state
legislature amends state law to authorize local

10 governments to require the development and

11 restriction of affordable rental units in the manner set forth in this section."
59. On September 29, 2017, Assembly Bill 1505 ("AB

12 1505") was signed into law,

13 and legislatively authorized local governments to require affordable housing units in new rental

14 housing developments, overturning the Palmer decision, with a January 1, 2018 effective date.
60.

15 Therefore, beginning on January 1, 2018, the first sentence of Davis Municipal

16 Code section 18.05.060, subdivision (e) (quoted in paragraph 57 above), became inapplicable,

17 and all provisions relating to rental housing in the Existing Housing Ordinance became binding
on "developer[s] of rental housing developments."

18 61.

19 Therefore, all provisions relating to rental housing in the Existing Affordable
Ordinance were operative and binding when the City Council considered and approved the
20 Revised Project on February 6, 2018.

21 62.

22 The Revised Project did not propose affordable housing consistent with the

23 requirements of the Existing Affordable Ordinance. When the City Council approved the

24 Revised Project, it did not require compliance with the Existing Affordable Ordinance.
63.

25 The Revised Project also restricted the proposed affordable housing to students
only. The City Council approved this restriction.

26 64.

27 Therefore, as approved, the Revised Project violates the Existing Affordable

28 Ordinance, and the City Council violated it when approving the project.

65. Although the Davis City Council considered an ordinance to amend Davis
2 Municipal Code section 18.050.060 ("Amended Affordable Ordinance") on February 6, 2018,
3 the Amended Affordable Ordinance did not have an effective date of and did not become

4 effective on February 6, 2018.

5 66. Accordingly, the Revised Project violated the affordable housing requirements of

6 the Davis Municipal Code, and the City has failed to proceed in accordance with law.

7 67. By approving the Entitlements and other approvals for the Revised Project without
8 affordable housing consistent with the Davis Municipal Code, the City acted arbitrarily,
9 capriciously, and without evidentiary support.

10 68. Petitioner is entitled to issuance of a writ of mandate setting aside all entitlements
11 and approvals that depend on the Revised Project providing affordable housing analysis
12 consistent with the Davis Municipal Code.

13 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

14 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as follows:

22 3. For injunctive relief enjoining Real Party and any successors in interest from

23 undertaking any construction of the Revised Project pursuant to the City's approval of the EIR
