PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA)

INTRODUCTION
2 1. Petitioner Golden State Environmental Justice Alliance, formerly SoCal

4 Environmental Justice Alliance, a California not for profit corporation ("Petitioner") challenges

5 the Moreno Valley Logistics Center ("Project"), located in the County of Riverside. The
proposed Project analyzed in the EIR calls for the development of 4 industrial buildings with a
6

7 combined floor area of approximately 1,736,180 square feet on 89.4 acres of land.

2.
8 The City of Moreno Valley ("Respondent") certified the Environmental Impact
Report ("EIR") for the Project.
9 3.
10 In approving the Project, the Respondent violated provisions of CEQA requiring

11 that the EIR adequately analyze significant adverse environmental impacts. The Respondent

12 further violated the requirement that it analyze a reasonable range of alternatives, and that it

13 adopt an environmentally superior alternative. Respondent failed to adopt all feasible mitigation

14 for project impacts, and the analysis of impacts and the planned mitigation measures is uncertain

15 and is unreasonably deferred. The level of review adopted by Respondent was insufficient and

16 therefore did not allow decision makers to intelligently consider the environmental consequences
of the Project.
17
4.
18 Respondent's Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations were

19 not supported by substantial evidence in the record. The Statement of Overriding Considerations

20 was improperly adopted when feasible mitigation measures and alternatives existed to lessen
significant project impacts.
21

22 JURISDICTION AND VENUE
23 5.
24 This Court has jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and
1094.5 and for declaratory relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 1060. The Court has
25 jurisdiction of CEQA matters pursuant to Pub. Resources Code sections 21168, 21168.5, and
26 21168.9.
27

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 2

1
6.
2 Venue is proper in this Court because the Respondent and Project are located in
Riverside County and the actions giving rise to the causes of action herein transpired in
3 Riverside County. See Code of Civil Procedure §§ 393 and 394.

7. This action is timely filed within 30 days of the posting of the Notice of
Determination under CEQA.
6
8.
7 Petitioner has exhausted its administrative remedies by commenting on the
Project prior to the close of the public hearing on the Project in compliance with Public
Resources Code section 21177(b).
9.
10 Petitioner has complied with CEQA by filing and serving with this Petition for

11 Writ of Mandate a Notice to the City of Intent to File pursuant to Pub. Resources Code section

12 21167.5, a Notice to Attorney General of Commencement of Action pursuant to Pub. Resources
Code section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388, and a Notice of Commencement
13 of Action to Responsible Agencies pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6.5.
14

15
PARTIES
16
10.
17 Petitioner Golden State Environmental Justice Alliance, formerly SoCal

18 Environmental Justice Alliance ("Petitioner") is a California not for profit corporation devoted to

19 the preservation of the environment as well as the promotion of safe and healthy communities. It

20 is a corporation formed and operating under the laws of the State of California. Members of

21 Petitioner are taxpayers who reside in or near the City of Moreno Valley and would be

22 irreparably harmed by the Project's environmental impacts and have an interest in ensuring open,
accountable, and responsive government and in protecting the region's environment. Petitioner
23

24 and its members submitted comments on the Project, bring this action on behalf of the public,

25 and are acting as private attorneys general conferring a significant benefit on the general public
or a large class of persons under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.
26 11.
27 Respondent City of Moreno Valley ("Respondent") is a municipal corporation

28 located in Riverside County and the lead agency for the Project under CEQA. Respondent is the

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 3

1
agency charged with regulating and administering land use and development within its territory
2 in compliance with the provisions of its General Plan and zoning ordinances as well as
3

4 applicable provisions of state law including CEQA. As the lead agency for the Project,

5 Respondent has the duty to ensure compliance with these applicable laws. Respondent is
authorized and required by law to hold public hearings, to determine whether CEQA applies to
6

7 development within its jurisdiction, to determine the adequacy of and certify environmental
documents prepared pursuant to CEQA, and to determine whether a project is compatible with
8 the objectives, policies, general land uses, and programs specified in the General Plan.
9
12.
10 Real Party in Interest Prologis LP is the applicant for the Project and is therefore

11 served as Real Party in Interest pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6.5(a).

12 Prologis LP is a Delaware limited partnership that is located and does business in the County of
Riverside, State of California.
13 13.
14 The true names and capacities of the Respondents and Defendants identified as

15 1 DOES 1 through 100, and of the Real Parties in Interest identified as DOES 101 through 200 are

16 unknown to Petitioner, who will seek the Court's permission to amend this pleading in order to

17 allege the true names and capacities as soon as they are ascertained. Petitioner is informed and

18 believes and on that basis alleges that the fictitiously named Respondents and Defendants
through 100 have jurisdiction by law over one or more aspects
19 of the Project that is the subject

20 of this proceeding; and that each of the fictitiously named Real Parties in Interest 101 through

21 200 either claims an ownership interest in the Project or has some cognizable interest in the
Project.
22

23 STATEMENT OF FACTS AND COMMON ALLEGATIONS
24
14.
25 Petitioner opposes the Project and challenges certain actions taken by

26 Respondent. In particular, Petitioner seeks to invalidate the approvals with respect to the Project

27 on the grounds that Respondent has violated CEQA, the Planning and Zoning Law, and other

laws.
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 4

1
15. Petitioner seeks review by and relief from this Court under Public Resources
2 Code Section 21168 or 21168.5 as applicable; and Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1060 et seq.
3 and 1084 et seq., among other provisions of law.
4
16. Petitioner has satisfied all exhaustion-of-remedies requirements to maintain this
5 proceeding. By way of example and without limitation, Petitioner submitted written opposition
6

7 to the Project during the administrative proceedings for the Project.

17. Alternatively, and additionally, neither Public Resources Code Section 21177(a)-
8 (b) nor any other exhaustion-of-remedies requirement may be applied to Petitioner.
9
18.
10 Respondent's conduct in approving the Project without complying with CEQA

11 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion because, as alleged in this pleading, it failed to

12 proceed in the manner required by law and made findings not supported by substantial evidence.

19.
13 Petitioner has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of

14 law, since its members and other members of the public will suffer irreparable harm as a result of

15 Respondent's violations of CEQA and other laws. Respondent's approval of the Project also
rests on the failure to satisfy a clear, present, ministerial duty to act in accordance with those
16

17 laws. Even when Respondent is permitted or required by law to exercise its discretion in

18 approving projects under those laws, it remains under a clear, present, a ministerial duty to
exercise its discretion within the limits of and in a manner consistent with those laws.
19

20 Respondent has had and continues to have the capacity and ability to approve the Project within

21 the time limits of and in a manner consistent with those laws, but Respondent has failed and
refused to do so and has exercised its discretion beyond the limits of and in a manner that a is not
22 consistent with those laws.
23 20. Petitioner has a beneficial a right and interest in Respondent's fulfillment of all its
24 legal duties as alleged in this pleading.
25

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 5

1 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
2 Failure to Prepare Adequate Environmental Impact Report
3 (Against all Respondents and Real Parties in Interest)
4
21. Paragraphs throug 20 are fully incorporated into this paragraph.
5
22. CEQA requires that every environmental impact report identify and analyze the
6

7 significant adverse environmental impacts of a proposed project, giving due consideration to
both short term and long term impacts, providing decision makers with enough information to
8 enable them to make an informed decision with full knowledge of the likely consequences of
9 their actions, and providing members of the public with enough information to participate
10 meaningfully in the project approval and environmental review process. CEQA also requires
11

12 that every environmental impact report identify and analyze a reasonable range of alternatives to

13 a proposed project. CEQA further requires that every environmental impact report identify and
analyze all reasonable mitigation measures for a proposed project 's significant adverse
14 environmental impacts. In each respect, CEQA mandates that the analyses contained in an
15 environmental impact report and all decisions of the lead agency based on the report be
16 supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record.
17
23. • The Project's EIR fails to provide adequate identification and analysis of the
18 significant adverse environmental impacts of the Project. Further, neither the analysis of impacts
19 in the Project's EIR nor Respondent's certification of the EIR in this respect is supported by
20 substantial evidence in the administrative record.
21
24. The EIR is inadequate in ways that include, but are not limited to, those described
22
below.
23 Diesel Particulate Matter Health Risk Emissions Inadequately Evaluated
24
25. The EIR uses the U.S. EPA's AERMOD software program to model emissions
25 and evaluate whether mobile source diesel particulate matter (DPM) emissions resulting from
26 Project construction and operation would pose a significant health risk to nearby sensitive
27

28 receptors (DEIR, p. 4-3-23). According to Table ES-3 in Appendix B-2, the calculated cancer

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 6

-

2 risk to nearby sensitive receptors from exposure to DPM emissions during Project construction

3 and operation for residential, worker, and school children receptors is 9.5 in one million, 0.31 in

4 one million, and 0.60 in one million, respectively, which is below the South Coast Air Quality

5 Management District's (SCAQMD) significance threshold of ten in one million (Appendix B-2,
Pp. 13).
6
26.
7 As result, EIR concludes that, "the Project will not cause a significant human

8 health or cancer risk" (Appendix B-2, p. 5). This conclusion, however, is incorrect. In February

9 2015, the California Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Environmental Health Hazard

10 Assessment (OEHHA) released updated health risk assessment guidelines that require risk

11 calculations for specific age groupings that incorporate several age specific factors in the cancer

12 risk calculation to adjust for carly in life exposure to carcinogens. According to the EIR,

13 "applicable ASFs and breathing rates consistent with 2015 OEHHA Guidelines were applied"* to

14 the Project's health risk assessment (HRA) (Appendix B-2, p. 39). Review of the Project's

15 HRA, however, demonstrates that not only did the EIR apply an incorrect age sensitivity factor

16 (ASF) when calculating the Project's total cancer risk, but it also failed to use age specific

17 breathing rates for the 3rd Trimester, infant, and child age groups. As a result, the potential

18 excess cancer risk posed to children and infants is not accurately represented and therefore, the

19 health risk assessment in the EIR should not be relied upon to determine Project significance.

20 Age Sensitivity Factors

27.
21 OEHHA was tasked with developing guidelines for conducting health risk

22 assessments under the Air Toxics Hot Spots Program (Health and Safety Code Section

23 43360(b)(2)). OEHHA initially developed Technical Support Documents (TSDs) in 1999-2000

24 in response to this statutory requirement. Since 2000, they have revised and adopted TSDs in an

25 effort to present updated methodologies that reflect scientific knowledge and techniques

26 developed since the previous guidelines were prepared; in particular, to explicitly include

27 consideration of possible differential effects on the health of infants, children and other sensitive

28 subpopulations, in accordance with the mandate of the Children's Environmental Health

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 7

1 Protection Act (Senate Bill 25, Escutia, Chapter 731, Statutes of 1999, Health and Safety Code
2 Sections 39669.5 et seq.).
3
28. In 2009, OEHHA assessed the impact of cancer potency on age of exposure and
4

5 concluded that, "the potency of carcinogens, and thus cancer risk, varies based on the lifestage at
exposure... accounting for effects of early-in- life exposure requires accounting for both the
6

7 increased potency of early in life exposure to carcinogens and the greater exposure on a per kg

8 body weight that occurs early in life due to behavioral and physiological differences between

9 infants and children, and adults.»l The guidance document continues on to explain that "in the

10 absence of chemical-specific data, OEHHA recommends a default ASF of 10 for the third

11 trimester to age 2 years, and an ASF of 3 for ages 2 through 15 years to account for potential
increased sensitivity to carcinogens during childhood.»2 To address this issue, OEHHA released
12

13 updated risk exposure guidelines requiring an Age Sensitivity Factors (ASF) to be applied to

14 early life exposures in the absence of chemical-specific data. These factors were incorporated

15 into OEHHA's most recent Risk Assessment Guidelines: Guidance Manual for Preparation of
Health Risk Assessments, which was formally adopted in March of 2015.
16
29. Therefore, to provide an appropriate analysis of the increased sensitivity to
17

18 carcinogens during early-in-life exposure, ASFs should have been applied to the Project's health
risk assessment at the time the analysis was conducted. Review of the EIR's HRA demonstrates
19

20 that instead of applying the appropriate ASFs to each age group, the EIR utilized a single

21 weighted ASF to calculate the lifetime residential cancer risk (Appendix B-2, pp. 29-59).

30.
22 As demonstrated above, the HRA relies upon a weighted age sensitivity factor of

23 2.6 to calculate the Project's total residential cancer risk. The EIR's use of a weighted ASF to

24 account for the health risk posed to infants and children, instead of applying the proper ASF to

25 each age group bin, however, is entirely incorrect. The use of age bins when estimating exposure

26

Ibid., p. 8-4
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 8

1 and the potential for developing cancer over a lifetime allows more refined exposure information
2

3 to be used. OEHHA recommends that the health risk impacts be calculated by each age group
and then summed to estimate the potential cancer risk over a lifetime. The method used by the
4
EIR significantly underestimates the residential lifetime cancer risk, as it fails to individually
5 assess the 3rd Trimester, infant, and child's health risk. Therefore, the EIR's application of a
6
weighted ASF is improper, and as a result, the potential excess cancer risk posed to children and
7 infants is not accurately represented. As such, prior to certification of the EIR, an updated health
8
risk assessment should be prepared to include these updated values.
9
Omission of Age-Specific Breathing Rates
10 31. Not only does the EIR's HRA fail to apply ASFs when estimating the total
11
residential cancer risk, but it also fails to use age-specific breathing rates for infants and children.
12 As previously stated, the EIR asserts that breathing rates consistent with 2015 OEHHA
13

14 Guidelines were applied to the Project's HRA (Appendix B-2, p. 39). Review of the EIR's

15 HRA, however, demonstrates that this is not the case. Rather, the HRA uses a breathing rate of
352 L/kg-day, which reflects the inhalation rate of an adult, in order to estimate the total
16

17 residential cancer risk. By doing this, the HRA fails to account for the variability in infant and

18 children breathing rates. As a result, Petitioner find the Project's health-related impact to be
misrepresented and should not be relied upon to determine Project significance.
19 32.
20 To provide an appropriate analysis of the health effects on infants and children,

21 the 95th percentile breathing rates for the 3rd Trimester, infants, and children should have been

22 applied at the time the analysis was conducted. Review of the EIR and associated appendices,

23 however, demonstrate that an 80th percentile breathing rate of 352 L/kg-day was used to
estimate the Project's health risk impacts, rather than the 95th percentile breathing rates
24

25 according to each age category, as outlined in the table above (Appendix B-2, p. 30). According
to OEHHA guidance, breathing rates for the inhalation pathway are used in order to avoid
26 underestimating the cancer risk to the public, specifically children. Therefore, by failing to use
27

28 age specific breathing rates when calculating the Project's total cancer risk, the Project's health

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 9

2 risk impact is underestimated. These age specific breathing rates should be applied in an updated
health risk assessment in an effort to accurately determine the potential cancer risk posed to
3 infants and children residing near the Project site. Until an updated HRA is prepared, the Project
4
should not be approved.
5
33. Additionally, and alternatively, the Project's EIR fails to provide adequate
6

7 identification and analysis of a reasonable range of alternatives to the Project. Neither the

8 analysis of alternatives in the EIR nor Respondent's certification of the EIR in this respect is
supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record.
9
34. CEQA requires that an EIR consider a "reasonable range of alternatives,"
10 Guidelines § 15126.6(a), and that the document must include a discussion of alternatives even if
11 to some degree they would limit accomplishment of the project's objectives, or would be more
12 costly. Guidelines § 15126.6(b).
13
35. Respondent failed to adequately identify, analyze, and consider alternatives that
14

15 lessened the Project's impacts. The CEQA Guidelines mandate that "The range of potential
alternatives to the proposed project shall include those that could feasibly accomplish most of the
16

17 basic objectives of the project and could avoid or substantially lessen one or more of the
significant effects." Guidelines 8 15126.6(c).
18
36.
19 Additionally, and alternatively, the Project's EIR fails to provide adequate

20 identification and analysis of measures to mitigate the Project's significant adverse

21 environmental impacts and fails to eliminate or substantially eliminate all such impacts. Neither
the analysis of mitigation measures nor Respondent's certification of the EIR in this respect is
22 supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record.
23 37. CEQA requires an agency to adopt feasible mitigation measures that will
24 substantially lessen or avoid the Project's potentially significant impacts and to describe those
25

26 mitigation measures in the EIR. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002, 21081(a), 21100(b)(3); Guidelines

27 15126.4. A lead agency may not conclude that an impact is significant and unavoidable
without requiring the imposition of all feasible mitigation measures to reduce impacts to less
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 10

than significant levels. Guidelines §§ 15126.4, 15091.
2
38. CEQA also requires that an agency must adopt a "statement of overriding

4 considerations" for any significant effects which have not been mitigated to a level of

5 insignificance by mitigation measures or the adoption of alternatives. The agency must find

6 "that specific overriding economic, legal, social, technological, or other benefits of the project

7 outweigh the significant effects on the environment." Pub. Res. Code § 21081(b). The
statement of overriding considerations must be based on substantial evidence in the record. Pub.
8
Res. Code 21081.5; Guidelines § 15093(b).
9
39.
10 Respondent adopted the statement of overriding considerations when feasible
mitigation measures and project alternatives existed, in violation of CEQA. Pub. Res. Code
11

12 § 21081; Guidelines § 15092. Respondent also failed to make all required written findings

13 regarding the Project's impacts. Respondent also approved the Project based on one or more

14 written findings that there exist considerations outweighing the Project's significant adverse

15 environmental impacts, but there is not substantial evidence in the administrative record to
support all such findings. Moreover, Respondent approved the Project based on one or more
16 non-written findings that such considerations exist.
17
40.
18 As a result of Respondent's violations of CEQA, Petitioner has been harmed in

19 that the decision makers who approved the Project were not fully informed about the impacts of

20 mitigation measures for and alternatives to the Project prior to its approval, and the Petitioner

21 and the public will have to endure significant, avoidable, unmitigated adverse environmental

22 impacts without there being any (or there being insufficient) benefits to outweigh such impacts.

23 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays
24
1.
25 For the Court's peremptory writ of mandate requiring the Respondent to set aside

26 its decision certifying the EIR for the Project (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168, 21168.5,
