FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

2 Petitioner TRUOJAI ("Petitioner" or "TRUOJAI") seeks a writ of mandate, declaratory
and injunctive relief against Respondent County of Ventura ("County" or "Respondent"), and
alleges as follows:

4 INTRODUCTION

1.

6 This Petition challenges the County's June 19, 2018 decision to adopt the ordinance
entitled, "County-Initiated Proposal to Amend Articles 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 14, and 18 of the Non-
Coastal Zoning Ordinance ("NCZO") (PL 17-0138) to Regulate Temporary Rental Units" ("TRU
Ordinance").

2. The TRU Ordinance puts into place strict compliance regulations (including

Butler & Mitchell uP 10  permitting requirements, inspections, occupancy limits, etc.) for Temporary Rental Units'

Jeffer Mangeis 11 ("TRUs") throughout the unincorporated areas of the County.
12 3. In addition to those strict compliance regulations, the TRU Ordinance entirely bans

-e NEWI 13 STRs in the Ojai Valley through an overlay zone, without any justification as to why the Ojai
14 Valley should be treated any differently than the rest of the County.

15 4. The record before the County in connection with its review and consideration of the
16 TRU Ordinance established that its regulations, including the ban on STRs in the entire Ojai
17 Valley, will result several significant environmental impacts, including, but not limited to: 1)
18 increased traffic and vehicle miles traveled, 2) increased greenhouse gas emissions as a result of
19 the additional vehicle trips, 3) adverse impacts to air quality, and 4) urban decay caused by
20 potentially devastating economic impacts of the TRU Ordinance. This is largely because, with the
21  lack of alternative short-term lodging in the area, banning STRs in the Ojai Valley-a popular
22 visitor serving destination adjacent to the tourist town of Ojai-will force Ojai and Ojai Valley
23 visitors to lodge in Ventura or other further away locations and drive to and from Ojai and the Ojai

24 Valley to enjoy its local charms and attributes. This in turn will result in more vehicle miles
25 traveled and more greenhouse gas and criteria contaminant emissions. Furthermore, the record
26 before the County also established that the loss in business revenue from tourists who are unable

27 TRUs is a term that includes both short-term rentals ("STR") as well as homeshares, under the 28 TRU Ordinance.

62380800v2 2
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

to secure alternative lodging and unwilling to make the long trek from areas where lodging is

2 available will cause distressing effects in the business community, which could lead to closures of

3 businesses and urban decay.

4 5. Prior to enacting the TRU Ordinance, the County was required to comply with the
California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") by studying and mitigating these significant or
6 potentially-significant environmental impacts and evaluating a range of feasible project
alternatives that would avoid these impacts altogether. The County, however, simply dispensed

8 with any CEQA review whatsoever, relying instead on the so-called."common sense exemption"

9 set forth in 14 California Code of Regulations, § 15061(b)(3) ("CEQA Guidelines"). This
10 exemption can only be employed to avoid CEQA review where. it is certain that there is no

Mangels etfecr larpebhl ue WEND 11 possibility a CEQA project under consideration may cause significant environmental impacts.
12 Importantly, the decision to proceed under CEQA Guidelines § 15061(b)(3) must be supported by
13 substantial record evidence, and the agency relying upon the exemption bears the burden of
14 proving its applicability.

15 6. The County's action fails to acknowledge the significant environmental impacts
16 that will arise from the passage and enforcement of the TRU Ordinance, and fails to comply with
17 the fundamental information and mitigation dictates of CEQA. The County cannot meet its
18 burden of proving that there is no possibility of significant environmental impacts here. Indeed,
19 the County failed to even conduct the necessary studies that would have analyzed whether or not
20 such environmental impacts exist, and by definition, there is no substantial record evidence
21 supporting the Notice of Exemption based upon CEQA Guidelines § 15061(b)(3).
22 7. The County's blatant disregard of its responsibilities under CEQA cannot stand.

23 8. In addition to the CEQA violation, the County also failed to comply with State
24 Planning and Zoning Law in connection with its adoption of the TRU Ordinance. Moreover, the
25 TRU Ordinance is facially void because it contravenes principles of equal protection, due process
26 (under both the state and federal constitutions), violates vested property rights, and constitutes a
27 regulatory taking of the distinct investment-backed expectations of those it effects.

28 9. The County also violated several provisions of the Brown Act (Govt. Code §§

62380800v2 3
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 54950, et seq.), as it did not provide the public with notice of key documents and actions that were
2 presented to and acted upon by the members of the Board of Supervisors.

3 10. A writ of mandate and declaratory and injunctive relief should be issued to stop the
4  enforcement and effectiveness of the TRU Ordinance, at least until the County fulfills its basic

5 CEQA duty of appropriately analyzing and mitigating the extensive significant environmental

6 impacts identified in the record by countless members of the public, through comment letters and
7 at public hearings.

8 THE PARTIES

11. Petitioner TRUOJAI, LLC is a California limited liability company and community
10 advocacy group composed of individuals and entities who own and operate real property and
dm leypaw gJapngT 11 improvements in the Ojai Valley area of the County and are concerned with the environmental

jeffer Mangels 12  impacts of the TRU Ordinance at issue in this Petition upon their properties and the surrounding
13 community.

WENE 14 12. Defendant County of Ventura is a county of the State of California existing under
15 the Constitution of the State of California with the capacity to sue and be sued. As used herein,
16 the term "County" includes, but is not limited to, the Board of Supervisors, the Planning
17 Commission, County employees, agents, officers, boards, commissions, departments, and their
18 members, all equally charged with complying with duties under the County Municipal Code, and
19 with the laws of the State.

20 13. Petitioner does not know the true names or capacities, whether individual,
21 corporate, associate or otherwise, of Respondent Does through 25, inclusive, and therefore sues
22 said Respondents under fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this Petition to show their true
23 names and capacities when and if the same have been ascertained.

24 JURISDICTION, VENUE AND EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

25 14. This Court has jurisdiction under Public Resources Code § 21168.5 and California
26 Code of Civil Procedure 8 1085.

27 15. Venue is proper in this Court because the causes of action alleged in this Petition
28 arose in Ventura County, and all parties are located or do business in Ventura County.

4 62380800v2
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

16. Petitioner complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code § 21167.5 and
California Code of Civil Procedure § 388 by serving on Respondent County written notice of
Petitioner's intention to commence this action on July 26, 2018. A copy of the proof of service is
attached hereto as Exhibit A.

17. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing the instant action, and
has exhausted any and  all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.
Petitioner appeared before the County prior to the adoption of the TRU Ordinance and objected

thereto.

18. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedies in the ordinary course of the
10 law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate and requires Respondent County to set

Mangels m pups, ops NENE 11  aside its adoption of the TRU Ordinance until appropriate CEQA review is undertaken.

12 THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT
upon the 13 19. CEQA, found at Public Resources Code § 21000, et seq., is based
14 principle that "the maintenance of a quality environment for the people of this state now and in the
15 future is matter of statewide concern." (Pub. Res. Code § 21000(a).)
16 20. In CEQA, the Legislature has established procedures designed to achieve these
17 goals-principally, the Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"). These procedures provide both for
18 the determination and for full public disclosure of the potential adverse effects on the environment
19 of discretionary projects that governmental agencies propose to approve, and require a description a
20 of feasible alternatives to such proposed projects and feasible mitigation measures to lessen their
21  environmental harm. (Pub. Res. Code § 21002.)

22 21. CEQA is not merely a procedural statute; it imposes clear and substantive
23 responsibilities on agencies that propose to approve projects, requiring that public agencies not
24 approve projects that harm the environment unless and until all feasible mitigation measures are
25 employed to minimize that harm. (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002, 21002.1(b).)
26 22. CEQA defines a project as "the whole of an action, which has a potential for
27 resulting in either a direct physical change to the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect
28 physical change in the environment." (CEQA Guidelines § 15378(a).) In this case, the project is

5 62380800v2
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 the passage of the TRU Ordinance.

2 23. Failure either to comply with the substantive requirements of CEQA or to carry out
3 the full CEQA procedures so that complete information as to a project's impacts is developed and

4 publicly disclosed constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion that requires invalidation of the
5 public agency action regardless of whether full compliance would have produced a different result.

6 (Pub. Res. Code § 21005.)

7 24. The CEQA Guidelines establish procedures for calculating the baseline
8 environmental conditions, including description of the physical environmental conditions in the

9 vicinity of the project, as they exist at the time the notice of preparation is published, or if no
10 notice of preparation is published, at the time of the environmental analysis is commenced.

NENI 11 (CEQA Guidelines § 15125(a).)

12 25. Agencies may not undertake actions that could potentially have a significant
13 adverse effect on the environment, or limit the choice of alternatives or mitigation measures,
14 before complying with CEQA. (CEQA Guidelines § 15004(b)(2).) The "lead agency," the public
15 agency that has the principal responsibility for carrying out the project, is responsible for
16 conducting an initial study to determine, in consultation with other relevant state and local
17 agencies, whether an environmental impact report, a negative declaration, or a mitigated negative
18 declaration will be prepared for a project. (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21067; 21080.1(a); 21083(a).)

19 26. "All phases of project • planning, implementation, and operation" must be

20 considered in the Initial Study for project. (CEQA Guidelines § 15063(a)(1).)
21 27. After an Initial Study, an EIR must be prepared "[i]f there is substantial evidence,
22 in light of the whole record before the lead agency, that the project may have a significant effect a

23 on the environment. . .." (Pub. Res. Code § 21080(d).) That is, an EIR must be prepared "if a lead
24 agency is presented with a fair argument that the project may have a significant effect on the

25 environment even though it may also be presented with other substantial evidence that the
26 project will not have a significant effect." (Guidelines § 15064(f)(1).)

27 28. The CEQA Guidelines charge public agencies with the responsibility of avoiding or
28 minimizing environmental damage where feasible. As part of this responsibility, public agencies

6 62380800v2
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

are required to balance various public objectives, including economic, environmental, and social
2 issues. CEQA review is integral to that process, informing decision-makers and the general public
what significant environmental effects a might result from a proposed project. In addition, the
process identifies possible means of mitigating any significant effects and presents reasonable
alternatives to the project.

29. In this case, the County has decided to forego the entire CEQA process that is
normally undertaken for a legislative action of this magnitude, and has instead purported to
implement the "common sense exemption" under CEQA Guidelines § 15061(b)(3). Under the

9 terms of the exemption, the evidence must support an agency determination that "it can be seen
10 with a certainty that there is no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant

• Mangels MN 11 effect on the environment." (Id.)

12 30. In other words, the County did not undertake an Initial Study to determine, in
13 consultation with other relevant state and local agencies, whether an environmental impact report,

As 14 a negative declaration, or a mitigated negative declaration will be prepared for the project.
15 such, the County also did not undertake any of those three environmental analysis options under
16 CEQA.

17 31. Rather, in spite of all of the evidence in the record regarding potential
18 environmental impacts relating to vehicle traffic, air quality, greenhouse gases, and urban decay,
19 the Count unlawfully issued a Notice of Exemption under the common sense exemption - boldly
20 ignoring the legal standard, which would require CEQA analysis even if there is a possibility of
21 significant effect on the environment.

22 FACTS COMMON TO ALL CAUSES OF ACTION

23 A. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

24 32. On July 28, 2015, the Board of Supervisors directed staff to study the issue of
25 TRUs in the unincorporated areas of the County. (March 1, 2018 Planning Commission Staff
26 Report for PL 17-0138, p. 2.)

27 33. From December 2015 to December 2016, the Board conducted 3 public workshops,
28 and in response to staff analysis and public testimony, the Board directed staff to develop options

62380800v2
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

for regulating TRUs based on three objectives, in order of priority: 1) quality of life in
2 neighborhoods must be maintained; 2) supply of housing for purchase and/or long-term rental
should not be significantly reduced; and 3) TRUs should enhance the local economy. (Id.)

34. Ultimately, the Board directed staff to prepare zoning ordinance amendments to
require the following: 1) Allow TRUs in residential zones with a ministerial permit subject to

6 regulations, and 2) in the Ojai Valley, prohibit TRUS except in historic properties, and phase out
existing Ojai Valley TRUs that are properly registered and paying transient occupancy taxes. (Id.
8 at p. 3.)

9 35. From the very beginning of the process, when the Board was first directing staff to
10 prepare the TRU Ordinance, it had already singled out the Ojai Valley for special disparate

11 treatment.
9 - & Mitchell - Mangels 12 36. In or around December 2017, the Ojai Area Municipal Advisory Committee

203 13 ("MAC") held a hearing in respect to the proposed TRU Ordinance. At the conclusion of the
" WIWT 14 hearing, the MAC Board recommended that STRs not be banned in the Ojai Valley as was being
15 proposed at the time.
16 37. County Planning staff eventually drafted the TRU Ordinance by March 1, 2018,
17 when it went before the Planning Commission for hearing. (Id.)
18 38. The following is a summary of some of the notable regulations and standards in the
19 TRU Ordinance:

20 Establishes definitions for "short-term rental" (rental of a home for under 30 days) and
21 "homeshare" (home where occupant is present, and rents out a portion of the home),
22 and identifies them as accessory uses to dwellings requiring a ministerial permit
23 Establishes ownership requirements and limitations (e.g. only one TRU per owner)

24 Defines ineligible dwellings (e.g. permitted accessory dwelling units)

25 Establishes an overlay zone over the Ojai Valley that effectively bans all STRs,

26 except those on historic landmark properties.

27 Establishes a 2 year amortization period (or grace period) for existing TRU uses

28 which do not meet eligibility requirements.

62380800v2 8
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

Limits permits to 1 year in duration
Sets overnight occupancy limits at 2 persons per bedroom, plus 2 others
Establishes on-site parking requirements and noise limitations

Prohibits on-site events

Specifies property management and complaint response requirements
Establishes a complete inspection, compliance, and enforcement program
(June 12, 2018 Board of Supervisors Staff Report, p. 4)

39. It is significant that all of the regulations imposed by the TRU Ordinance are of
general applicability to the County as a whole, except for the overlay zone banning STRs in the
10 Ojai Valley only (except for historical properties).
11 40. On March 1, 2018, when the TRU Ordinance was brought before the Planning leffec lapgacheilur fer Mangels : WEINE 12 Commission, there was ample discussion regarding the STR limitation in Ojai Valley and the
13 concentration of STRs in other areas of the unincorporated county. (Id. at p. 5.)
14 41. The Planning Commission preferred that there be some numeric or density-based
15 limit on STRs across the entire unincorporated area instead of a strict limit in the Ojai Valley and
16 no limit elsewhere in the County, as directed by the Board. (Id. at p. 5.)
17 42. The Planning Commission expressed significant discomfort with the recommended
18 STR limitations/prohibitions in the Ojai Valley and the lack of any numeric limitations in other
19 unincorporated areas of the County. (Id.)

20 43. The Planning Commission did not find that the information provided by staff
21 supported treating the Ojai Valley differently than the remainder of the unincorporated area, nor
•22 did they find that the impacts of high numbers of STRs on neighborhood character in other areas
23 were adequately addressed. (Id.)

24 44. a As a result, the Planning Commission directed Planning Division staff to conduct
25 additional analysis and develop alternate regulations for the Planning Commission's consideration
26 that include numeric and/or density-based limits for the STRs ("the Density Analysis") across the
27 unincorporated County. (Id.)

28 45. The issue of the Planning Commission's recommendation regarding the Density

9 62380800v2
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 Analysis went before the Board of Supervisors on May 1, 2018. (Id.)

46.

3 needed to conduct the Density Analysis. (May 1, 2018 Board of Supervisors Staff Report, p. 4.) 2 The staff report for the May 1, 2018 hearing explained that $25,000 to $30,000 was

47. The staff report also (mistakenly) explained that if the Board does not approve the
5 budget for the Density Analysis, then it could either 1) send the matter back to the Planning 4

6 Commission for a formal updated recommendation regarding the existing draft TRU Ordinance, or
7 2) skip that step and just direct the staff to schedule a public hearing for the Board's consideration
8 of the existing draft TRU Ordinance. (Id.).

48. The first alternative above - sending the matter back to the Planning Commission
10 for a formal recommendation was the only legal option available to the Board pursuant to 9

11 Government Code §65855. e IlyPUW g Jopng 49. The second alternative presented in the May 1, 2018 staff report is contrary to law, sjaBuew Jayal 13 because the Government Code §65855 provides: "After the hearing, the planning commission 12

NENI 14 shall render its decision in the form of a written recommendation to the legislative body.
15 Such recommendation shall include the reasons for the recommendation, the relationship of
16 the proposed ordinance or amendment to applicable general and specific plans, and shall be
17 transmitted to the legislative body in such and manner as may be specified by the legislative

50. The recommendation given by the Planning Commission after the March 1, 2018 18 body." (emphasis added.)

20 hearing did not contain many of the elements required by Government Code §65855, such as 1) an 19

21 actual recommendation regarding the TRU Ordinance itself, 2) reasons for the recommendation,
22 and 3) the relationship of the proposed ordinance or amendment to applicable general and specific
it 23 plans. Therefore, it was an absolute must that the matter go back to the Planning Commission for
24 a formal recommendation compliant with Government Code §65855.

25 51. At the May 1, 2018 Board meeting, the Board of Supervisors rejected the Density
26 Analysis, and chose to proceed with the illegal alternative presented by staff - bypass the legally
27 required formal recommendation from the Planning Commission, and proceed directly to a Board
28 of Supervisors hearing to approve the matter. (June 12, 2018 Board of Supervisors Staff Report, p.

10
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF 62380800v2

5)

2 52. Furthermore, in lieu of the Density Analysis, the Board directed staff to identify
other options for addressing concerns regarding the treatment of legal nonconforming TRUs. (Id.)

53.

6 The short 2 year amortization period had been identified in several comment letters
as a serious problem that would infringe on vested property rights of various TRU owners. As
such, the expansion of the amortization period to allow for a longer period of time for owners to
recoup their investment was seen as an alternative method by which a just result could be
8 achieved, without having to conduct the Density Analysis.

54.

10

er & Mitchell LLP As a result of this direction, staff drafted and presented 4 options to the Board, all

Mangels of which expanded the scope of the amortization period, and/or gave additional rights to non-
11 conforming TRUs ("Amortization Options"). (Id. at pp. 5-8.)

12 55.

L3 JMBM& 14 56. On June 12, 2018, the County set the TRU Ordinance for hearing, including the 4
13 Amortization Options. (Id.)

16 Dozens of members of the public spoke out at the June 12, 2018 urging the Board
15 to either adopt one of the Amortization Options, or vote against the adoption of the TRU

Ordinance.

17 57.

19 Public comments included various references to significant environmental impacts,
18 including: 1) traffic exacerbation and vehicle miles traveled (which leads to associated greenhouse
gas emissions and air quality issues), and 2) economic devastation of businesses that could lead to
20 urban decay.

21 58. The subject of environmental impacts, however, was not a factor a in the discussion
22 during the Board's deliberation period. Rather, the Board was focused on putting the final touches
23 on the TRU Ordinance draft in order to pass it as quickly as possible, including the Ojai Valley
24 overlay zone.

25 59.

27 At the June 12, 2018 hearing, Supervisor Bennett distributed to the other board
26 members a draft of amendments to the ordinance that he had proposed the day before (according

28 to his own public statement). (Video of June 12, 2018 meeting, available on the County website.)

60.

62380800v2 Those amendments were not made available to the public for review or comment

11
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

prior to the hearing.

2 61. At some point during the deliberations, the last minute changes from Supervisor
3 Bennett that were not available to the public sparked a comment from Supervisor Foy: "Do we
4 really have to go over this now, or just wait a week and let it all be written and put it in one? ... He
5 [Bennett] just keeps adding different things to it." (Video of June 12, 2018 meeting at 8:42:12,
6 available on the County website.)

7 62. The Board did not take action on June 12, 2018 on the TRU Ordinance, but rather,
8 continued the matter to June 19, 2018, but without reopening public comment.

9 63. Counsel for TRU OJAI sent a letter on June 14, 2018 advising the Board of
10 Supervisors of procedural irregularities described above, and the violations of due process and the

• Mangels r & Mitchell LLP 11 Brown Act that are implicated by deliberations on documents not provided to the public.
12 64. Yet, rather than making the document available to the public, and re-opening the

*oepes 13 matter for public comment (which would have been extremely easy to do, given the timing, and
"WNENE 14 given the fact that the Board had not taken action yet), the Board continued the matter to June 19,
15 2018 without giving the public an opportunity to comment on the secret last-minute draft
16 distributed by Supervisor Bennett.

17 65. Indeed, far be it from taking the opportunity to inform the public, the County
18 doubled down on the Brown Act violation a in a response letter on June 15, 2018, admitting that
19 "Supervisor Bennett thereafter created the document he distributed on June 12...so that his
20 proposed changes would be shown on the latest staff recommended version of the TRU
21 Ordinance."

22 66. The document distributed by Supervisor Bennett was not available to the public at
23 the June 12, 2018 hearing. Neither counsel for TRU OJAI, nor the dozens of members of TRU
24 OJAI, nor the public at large (all of whom were confused regarding what was happening in real
25 time when Supervisor Bennett was distributing documents to other Board members) had the
26 opportunity to see the document, or comment publicly upon it. Indeed, the Supervisor Bennet
27 distributed the document to the other Supervisors after the close of public comment, perhaps
28 specifically to avoid public comment on such procedural irregularities.

62380800v2 12
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

67. At the June 19, 2018 hearing, County Counsel announced at the beginning of the
2 hearing that the public comment period did not need to be re-opened per Government Code
3 54954.3 unless there was a substantial change made to the TRU Ordinance. Shortly after this
4 admonition, Supervisor Bennett, referring to an anonymous letter that had been submitted back on

5 June 8, 2018, decided to also strike "sites of merit"? from the properties that would be exempt from

6 the STR ban in Ojai Valley, tightening the chokehold on the Ojai Valley restriction on STRs.

68. Action was taken on June 19, 2018 to approve the TRU Ordinance, with no further

8 opportunity given to the public to comment on the eleventh hour amendments.

69. On June 19, 2018, the Board voted to adopt the TRU Ordinance.

10 70. Importantly, the TRU Ordinance was adopted without incorporation of any of the 4

sjaBuew WENS 11 Amortization Options. Recall that the Board of Supervisors discarded the Planning Commission's
12 recommendation for a Density Analysis, and instead asked the staff to set the TRU Ordinance for
13| hearing with 4 Amortization Options, in order to resolve some of those problems. Then, when it
14 came time for the vote, none of those 4 Amortization Options were adopted, and therefore, the
15 original problems that were identified by the Planning Commission (and a large contingent of the
16 general public) were never resolved.
17 71. On June 21, 2018, the County recorded the Notice of Exemption ("NOE") for the

18 project.

19 72. The NOE lists the exempt status as "Categorical Exemption."
20 73. The NOE provides that the justification for exemption is as follows: "Case No. PL
21 17-0138 is exempt from California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) review pursuant to CEQA
22 Guidelines § 15061(b)(3), because the amendments would not cause any physical change and
23 therefore could not have a significant effect on the environment."

24 B. THE COUNTY FAILED TO COMPLY WITH CEQA

25 74. There is an abundance of comments in the record (both orally, and in writing)
26 regarding citizens' concerns for the environmental impacts of the TRU Ordinance.

27 75. Comments even a included a traffic study from Associated Transportation Engineers
28 ("ATE Study", Exhibit 20 to the June 12 and June 19, 2018 staff reports) entitled "Short-Term

62380800v2 13 •
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

Rentals and Increased Traffic Is There a Connection?" The ATE Study "reviews the traffic

2 effects of providing short term rentals within residential neighborhoods in Ventura County, with a
specific focus on the Ojai Valley area."

4 76. The ATE Study concludes that STRs generate less traffic a than a traditional single

5 family unit, and that STRs generate significantly less peak hour traffic, and that the majority of
6 trips generated by STRs are local in nature (as opposed to residents who have to commute to work
7 during peak times).

77. The ATE Study, and the dozens of public commenters, raised the possibility that
there would be significant traffic impacts. Traffic impacts (including increased vehicle miles
10 traveled) also form the basis for other significant environmental impacts such as greenhouse gas
11
Butler & Mitchell up emissions, and air quality.

sjeBuey rayaf 12 78: Also, the economic impacts of the project are potentially devastating to local
13 businesses, which could cause the closing of businesses, which in turn, could create urban decay.
NEWS 14 79. Yet, these comments fell on deaf ears, and the Board illegally issued the NOE,
15 despite the fact that there is no way that they could meet the legal standard for the exemption that
16 they claimed: "where it is certain that there is no possibility the project may cause significant
17 environmental impacts." CEQA Guidelines § 15061(b)(3)

18 80. An ordinance of this magnitude requires CEQA analysis, starting with an Initial
19| Study, and leading to either a Negative Declaration, Mitigated Negative Declaration or an EIR.

20 81. Despite the substantial eyidence that was provided showing a possibility of
21 significant environmental impacts, the County summarily dismissed and bypassed all CEQA
22 obligations, in violation of CEQA Guidelines § 15061(b)(3), and c. 15004(b)(2), and Pub. Res.
23 Code §§ 21067; 21080.1(a); 21083(a).

24 82. Furthermore, the fact that the County passed the TRU Ordinance without
25 conducting the Density Analysis, by definition, means that there was not substantial evidence to
26 support the ban in the Ojai Valley overlay zone, as opposed to some other density-based metric
27 that could be employed on a County-wide basis (as recommended by the Planning Commission).

28 83. Finally, the three purported objectives of the TRU Ordinance, in order of priority,

62380800v2 14
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

are: 1) quality of life in neighborhoods must be maintained; 2) supply of housing for purchase
2 and/or long-term rental should not be significantly reduced; and 3) TRUs should enhance the local
3 economy. (March 1, 2018 Planning Commission Staff Report for PL 17-0138, p. 2.)

4 84. There is no evidence to support that the ban in Ojai Valley would accomplish any

5 of those objectives.

6 85. As to the first objective, the quality of life is addressed through the permitting,
7 monitoring, and enforcement mechanisms provided throughout the TRU Ordinance. The ban in
8 Ojai Valley is inapplicable to the quality of life.

86. As to the second objective, there is no evidence in the record (either by way of
10| analyses, studies, or other scientific means) that Ojai Valley STRs would "significantly reduce"

3 11 the supply of housing for purchase or rent.

Mangels tler & Mitchell 12 87. Third, the ban in Ojai Valley would actually go directly contrary to the goal of

*aps 13 enhancing the local economy. Countless STR operators, citizens and business owners noted the
WEINI 14 negative economic impacts that would come with a ban.
15 C. THE COUNTY FAILED TO COMPLY WITH GOVERNMENT CODE § 65855
16
88.
17 When the Planning Commission on March 1, 2018 directed that the Density

18 Analysis be conducted by planning staff, it did not undertake the exercise of making a

19 recommendation that complies with Government Code §65855. Rather, it simply directed staff to

20 undertake the Density Analysis. (June 12, 2018 staff report to Board of Supervisors, pp. 4-5.)

89.
21 Government Code §65855 provides: "After the hearing, the planning commission

22 shall render its decision in the form of a written recommendation to the legislative body. Such

23 recommendation shall include the reasons for the recommendation, the relationship of the

24 proposed ordinance or amendment to applicable general and specific plans, and shall be

25 transmitted to the legislative body in such and manner as may be specified by the legislative

26 body."

90.
27 The recommendation given by the Planning Commission after the March 1, 2018

28 hearing did not contain many of the elements required by Government Code $65855, such as 1) an

62380800v2 15
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

actual recommendation regarding the TRU Ordinance itself, 2) reasons for the recommendation,
2 and 3) the relationship of the proposed ordinance or amendment to applicable general and specific

3

4 plans. Therefore, it was an absolute must that the matter go back to the Planning Commission for
a formal recommendation compliant with Government Code §65855.

5 91.

6 At the May 1, 2018 Board meeting, the Board of Supervisors chose to bypass the
legally required formal recommendation from the Planning Commission, and proceed directly to a
Board of Supervisors hearing to approve
8 §65855. the matter, in direct violation of Government Code

9 D.

10 THE COUNTY VIOLATED COUNTY RESIDENTS' DUE PROCESS
RIGHTS

11 92. The California Constitution provides that, "a
m IPYP4N g Jap person may not be deprived of life,

Mangels 12 liberty, or property without due process of law or denied equal protection of the laws." (Cal.

13 Const. Art. 1, § 7(a).)

*
JMBM 14 93. The United States Constitution also provides that a state cannot "deprive any

15 .person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law." (United States Constitution,

16 amend. XIV, § 1.)

17 94. The County violated County residents' right to due process given the. procedural

18 irregularities that took place at the June 12, 2018 and June 19, 2018 hearings. Among other

19 things, Supervisor Bennett distributed a document that was not made available to the public in

20 advance of the hearing (or concurrently with the hearing).

21 95. The Board proceeded to deliberate regarding that newly-created and newly

22 distributed document, much to the confusion of everyone who was in the audience at the hearing,

23 who were therefore deprived of their due process rights to comment upon and address the

24 proposed ordinance revisions.

E.
25 THE COUNTY VIOLATED THE BROWN ACT

96.
26 § 54950 - the introductory section of the Brown Act - states:

27 In enacting this chapter, the Legislature finds and declares that the public

28 commissions, boards and councils and the other public agencies in this State exist to aid in the conduct of the people's business. It is the intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly.

62380800v2 16
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

2 The people of this State do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies which serve them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the

3 right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know. The people insist on remaining informed so that they may retain control

4 over the instruments they have created.

97.
5 Government Code § 54957.5 provides, in relevant part:

6 (a) Notwithstanding Section 6255 or any other law, agendas of public meetings and any other writings, when distributed to all, or a majority of all, of the members of a

7 legislative body of a local agency by any person in connection with a matter subject to discussion or consideration at an open meeting of the body, are disclosable

8 public records under the California Public Records Act [cite], and shall be made available upon request without delay. However, this section shall not include any

9 writing exempt from public disclosure under Section 6253.5, 6254, 6254.3, 6254.7, 6254.15, 6254.16, 6254.22, or 6254.26.

10 (b) (1) If a writing that is public record under subdivision (a), and that relates to

11
tler & Mitchell LLP an agenda item for an open session of a regular meeting of the legislative body of a

fer Mangels 12 local agency, is distributed less than 72 hours prior to that meeting, the writing shall be made available for public inspection pursuant to paragraph (2) at the time the writing is distributed to all, or a majority of all, of the members of the body.

13
e WaND 14 (c) Writings that are public records under subdivision (a) and that are distributed

15 during: public meeting shall be made available for public inspection at the meeting if prepared by the local agency or a member of its legislative body, or after the meeting if prepared by some other person. These writings shall be made available

16 in appropriate alternative formats upon request by a person with a disability, as required by Section 202 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C.

17 Sec. 12132), and the federal rules and regulations adopted in implementation thereof.

18 98. The draft of amendments to the ordinance that Supervisor Bennett proposed the day
19 before are a public record because it was "distributed to all, or a majority of all, of the members of
20 a legislative body." (Govt. Code § 54957.5(a).)
21 99. The record was "distributed less than 72 hours prior to that meeting" and should
22 have been made available to the public at the same time. (Govt. Code § 54957.5(b).)
23 100. Alternatively, the record was "distributed during a public meeting" and should have
24 been "made available for public inspection at the meeting" because it was "prepared by a member
25 of [the Board of Supervisors'] legislative body." (Govt. Code § 54957.5(c).)

26 101. Thus, regardless of whether or not the document was distributed to other board
27 members the day before, or at the meeting itself, a there is a violation of either Government Code
28 54957.5(b) or 54957.5(c) respectively.

62380800v2 17
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

I 102. The failure to distribute the proposed amendments constituted a failure to conduct
2 an open meeting of the legislative body under Government Code § 54953(a).

3 103. In addition, the County failed to agendize the discussion of the proposed
4l amendments under Government Code 8 54954.2, and ignored County Counsel's admonition to

5 reopen the public comment period under Government Code § 54954.3 when a substantial change

6 was made to the TRU Ordinance by the elimination of "sites of merit" from the exemption to the
7 STR ban in the Ojai Valley.

8 104. Government Code § 54960.1 provides that interested parties may commence an
9 action by mandamus or injunction under the Brown Act for the purpose of obtaining a judicial
10 determination that an action taken by a legislative body of a local agency in violation of the Brown

m jeypaNl g lopng 11 Act is null and void. Prior to such action, the party must make a demand of the legislative body to

e, WENI 12 cure or correct the action taken in violation of the Brown Act.

13 105. On July 19, 2018, counsel for Petitioner sent a cure and correct letter to the County,
14 setting forth the violations of the Brown Act, and demanding that the County "either cure or
15 correct the challenged action, or inform us of your decision not to do so. If you fail to cure or
16 correct as demanded, we will seek judicial invalidation of the action pursuant to Government Code
17 § 54960.1, including an award of court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to Section
18 54960.5."

19 106. Pursuant to Government Code con 54960.1, "If the legislative body takes no action

20 within the 30-day period, the inaction shall be deemed a decision not to cure or correct the
21 challenged action."

22 107. The County did not respond to the cure and correct letter within 30 days, and the
23 County has therefore failed to cure and correct the Brown Act violations stated above.

24 108. Therefore, Supervisor Bennett's distribution of documents to the other Board
25 members without making those same documents available to the public is a clear violation of
26 several provisions of the Brown Act, and the action taken on June 19, 2018 (approval of the TRU
27 Ordinance) should therefore be invalidated and declared null and void through this action.
28 F. THE TRU ORDINANCE VIOLATES EQUAL PROTECTION

18
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF 62380800v2

109. The California Constitution provides that, "a person may not be deprived of life,
2 liberty, or property without due process of law or denied equal protection of the laws." Cal.
Const. Art. 1, 7(a).

110. The U.S. Constitution also prohibits the denial of equal protection through the
fourteenth amendment. United States Constitution, amend. XIV, § 1, and 42 USC § 1983.
111. The County must have a rational basis for treating Ojai Valley differently than
other unincorporated areas of the County.

112. The rational basis test requires that the classification be a demonstrably effective
means for furthering some actual valid government interest. (E.g., City of Cleburne v. Cleburne
10 Living Center (1985) 473 U.S. 432, 440.)

Butler & Mitchell LLP 11 113.

Jeffer Mangels 12 upon Here, the Planning Commission understood that the County lacked a rational basis
which it could recommend singling out Ojai Valley in an overlay zone, and instead,

; INETNÍ 13 recommended that a Density a Study take place to treat everyone in the County equally, and make
14 regulations based on actual density data (as opposed to arbitrary lines).
15 114. Indeed, according to the County's own June 12, 2018 staff report, the Planning
16 Commission expressed "significant discomfort with the recommended STR

17 limitations/prohibitions in the Ojai Valley and the lack of any numeric limitations in other areas of
18 the County." (June 12, 2018 staff report to Board of Supervisors, p. 5.)

19 115. The Planning Commission "did not find that the information provided by staff
20 supported treating the Ojai Valley differently than the remainder of the unincorporated area, nor
21 | did they find that the impacts of high numbers of STRs on neighborhood character in other areas
22 were adequately addressed." (Id.)

23 116. Yet, despite. the express acknowledgement by the Planning Commission of these
24 equal protection concerns, the Board simply enacted the TRU Ordinance, including the overlay
25 zone in Ojai Valley (banning STRs in all but historically designated properties).
26 117. There is no rational basis for treating the Ojai Valley differently than other
27 similarly situated unincorporated areas of the County. Indeed, the Density Analysis was never

28 undertaken.

62380800v2 19
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

118. Because of the County's hasty decision to pass the TRU Ordinance without doing
2 the Density Analysis, by definition, it did not have any evidence to support its decision regarding
3 the ban on STRs in the Ojai Valley through the overlay zone.

6 G. THE TRU ORDINANCE 2-YEAR AMORTIZATION PERIOD VIOLATES
VESTED PROPERTY RIGHTS
7
119. Despite the ban on STRs in Ojai Valley, current STR property owners and 8

9 operators will retain constitutionally-protected rights to maintain the use. Legal nonconforming

10 uses-i.e., "grandfathered" usesare lawful uses that were in place prior to the adoption of the

11 current zoning ordinance. (See Bauer v. City of San Diego, 75 Cal. App. 4th 1281, 1292-93
• & Mitchell uuP (1999).)
Mangels 12
120. Governmental entities
13 may not apply newly-enacted zoning ordinances, such as the
epe proposed TRU ordinance, to close businesses lawfully operating or shutter properties lawfully
WENI 14

15 used at the time those ordinances became effective. (See id. at 1292; see also Hansen Brothers

16 Enters., Inc. v. Bd. of Supervisors, 12 Cal . 4th 533, 552 (1996); Livingston Rock and Gravel Co.

17 V. County of Los Angeles, 43 Cal. 2d 121, 127 (1954) ("The rights of the users of property as those

18 rights existed under prevailing zoning conditions are well recognized and have always been

19 protected.").)

20 121. Even the County's zoning ordinances protect lawfully-established uses against

21 changes in zoning regulations. NCZO § 8113-10.3(a) provides: If [a] use or structure affected [by

22 a a change in a zoning ordinance] is existing lawfully as a permitted or conditionally permitted use

23 or structure, the existing use or structure is hereby deemed to be conforming without any further

action."
24
122.
25 STR property owners and operators also have federally- and state-protected vested

26 rights to maintain currently-lawful uses of their property. Under Avco Community Developers,

27 Inc. v. South Coast Regional Comm'n, a 17 Cal. 3d 785 (1976), a property owner that has incurred

28 substantial liabilities establishing a lawful use of property obtains a vested right to continue the

62380800v2 20
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

- use despite a subsequent change in zoning law. This rule parallels the common law vested rights
2 doctrine. (See Halaco Engineering Co. v. South Central Coast Regional Comm'n, 42 Cal. 3d 52,

3 57 (1986) (recognizing vested rights to maintain non-conforming use without obtaining a permit to
4 do so from the Regional Commission); Calvert v. County of Yuba, 145 Cal. App. 4th 613, 623

5

6 (2006) (nonconforming uses provide the basis for vested rights as to such uses).)
123. A zoning ordinance that requires immediate discontinuance of. a vested,
7 nonconforming use existing when the ordinance was adopted is a deprivation of property without

8

9 due process of law. (Santa Barbara Patients' Collective Health Co-op. V. City of Santa Barbara,
911 F. Supp. 2d 884, 893 (C.D. Cal. 2012); McCaslin v. City of Monterey Park, 163 Cal. App. 2d
10 339 346 (1958).)

Butler & Mitchell LIP 11 124.

fer Mangels If the law effects an unreasonable interference with an existing use, or a planned
12 use for which a substantial investment in development costs has been made, the ordinance may

L "o NEINL 13 not be applied to that property unless compensation is paid. (See Hansen Bros., 12 Cal. 4th at
14 551-52.) For this reason, "[z]oning ordinances and other land-use regulations customarily exempt
15 existing uses to avoid questions as to the constitutionality of their application to those uses." (See
16  id. at 552; see also Calvert, 145 Cal. App. 4th at 623 (existing uses must be exempted or
17 amortized over time to avoid unconstitutional deprivations of vested rights).)

18 125. The TRU Ordinance does not exempt existing uses, but instead, contains an
19 unusual and unnecessarily aggressive "amortization period"2 requiring STR owners and operators
20 to cease STR use within 2 years. 2

21 126. An ordinance that provides an amortization period, rather than protecting or
22 grandfathering existing uses, is constitutionally suspect because it ultimately results in the
23 extinction of a vested property right. Thus, ordinances requiring amortization must be carefully
24 designed so that the period provided is both (1) adequate to ensure that affected property owners
25

26 may spread the loss of their present beneficial uses of property over time; and (2) flexible enough

27 The proposed TRU Ordinance refers to this as a "grace period." The appropriate term is "amortization period" because it is intended (and constitutionally compelled where existing uses are not "grandfathered") to allow a property owner to recoup his or her investment in a use that is 28 prohibited by a newly-adopted zoning regulation.

62380800v2 21
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

to account for individual circumstances. The TRU Ordinance is neither.

2 127. In particular, the TRÜ Ordinance bans STRs within the overlay zone, which

3 corresponds to the jurisdictional boundaries of the Ojai Valley Municipal Advisory Council, and
4 only allows 2 years to cease all STRs in that area.

5 128. There are no data or economic studies analyzing or justifying this hyper-aggressive

6 2-year amortization period. Indeed, the Board eschewed the Planning Commission's reasonable

7 request for the Density Analysis, and instead, adopted a 2-year amortization period, which appears

8 to have been arbitrarily chosen with no real consideration as to whether it would provide an
9 amortization period commensurate with the investments of current STR property owners.

10 129. What makes the 2-year amortization period truly unusual is that the NCZO already

er & Mitchell ULP 11 contains an amortization provision applicable to all nonconforming uses throughout the County.
Mangels 12 That provision is set forth in NCZO § 8113-5.4, which provides that nonconforming uses within

*epe 13 structures such as houses: "shall be amortized…based on the square footage of the structure at the
"WENS 14 time the use is rendered nonconforming, as follows: Ten (10) years for one thousand (1,000)
15 square feet, plus one and one-quarter (1.25) years for each additional one hundred (100) square
16 feet over one thousand (1,000) square feet; maximum sixty (60) years."
17 130. Thus, by contrast to the TRU Ordinance amortization period, which is applicable
18 only to STRs and provides a maximum 2-years, the County's normal (and much more typical)
19 amortization period for nonconforming uses within structures is a minimum of 10 years, and up
20 to 60 years. Amortization periods for nonconforming uses generally run much longer-indeed
21 orders of magnitude longer--than the 2-year period provided by the current draft ordinance.

22 131. There is no rationale that can justify a 10- to 60-year amortization period for non-
23 STR uses, including all of the conceivable nonconforming nuisance uses that may exist in the

24 County, and only a 2-year amortization period for STRs.

25 132. Amortization periods must be justified by the public need for the deprivation of
26 property interests they result in. Here, the justification for the proposed STR ban in Ojai Valley is
27 exceedingly thin, because the County recognizes that STRs are not inherently injurious to the
28 public welfare, as the TRU Ordinance continues to permit the use in most parts of the County and

62380800v2 22
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 singles out only Ojai Valley property owners for disparate treatment.

2 133. Also, no showing has been made as to why the supposed ills of STR use are not
3 entirely addressed by the robust permitting, inspection and enforcement regime imposed by the

4

5 proposed ordinance in the areas of the County where STR use would remain lawful.

134.

6 Unlike amortization ordinances that affect commercial or industrial uses operating

7 within incompatible zones, the TRU Ordinance has direct and immediate impacts on the ability of

8 Ventura County residents to useand in many circumstances keep-their own homes.

135. If no public interest is served by a particular application of an amortization period,
9 the provision is unconstitutional as applied to that particular property. As with any exercise of the
10 police power, a reasonable expectation of public benefit must outweigh the harm an amortization

tler & Mitchell LLP Mangels 11 ordinance causes an individual. Therefore, the owner of a nonconforming use must at least be
12 allowed a reasonable opportunity to recover the original cost of his or her investment.

13 136.
11 "WANÍ 14 The amortization period here is not sufficient in the vast majority of cases to permit
Ojai Valley property owners to recoup and protect their investments and will effect a taking of
15 their properties without just compensation. (See. e.g., City of La Mesa v. Tweed & Gambrell
16 Planning Mill, 146 Cal. App. 2d 762 (1956) (five-year amortization period applied to building
17 with estimated remaining economic life of twenty years invalid); see also National Advertising
•18 Co. v. Monterey County, Cal. 3d 875 (1970) (removal of nonconforming use must await
19 expiration of reasonable amortization period to permit property owner to recover original cost).)
20 137. What is more, recognizing that individual circumstances vary and that flexibility is
21 required to ensure that the necessary amortization period is commensurate with individual
22 investments, the NCZO currently contains a mechanism for a property owner to obtain an
23 administrative determination to lengthen an amortization period in individual cases. Thus, NCZO
24 § 8113-5.4 allows the County's Planning Division to issue a continuation permit where
25 continuation is "not detrimental to the public interest, health, safety, convenience, or welfare."

26 138. In contrast, the TRU Ordinance contains no similar mechanism for extending the
27 strict 2-year amortization period even where the period fails to a provide a property owner with
28 sufficient time to recoup an investment and where allowing the continued use would not be

62380800v2 23
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

detrimental to the public welfare. The proposed extinction of property rights requires, at a

2 minimum, that the targeted property owners be afforded some measure of due process in the form
3 of an administrative hearing. The proposed TRO ordinance provides none, leaving property
4 owners with only one recourse to obtain redress for the constitutional injury: the courts.

5

6 H. THE TRU ORDINANCE EFFECTUATES A REGULATORY TAKING

139. Under Penn Central Transportation Company V. City of New York (1978) 438 US

8 104, even if a governmental regulation does not cause a physical invasion or deprive a landowner
of all economically beneficial use, it may nonetheless go too far in placing what should be a public
10 burden on private shoulders.

11 140. Penn Central established an ad hoc, fact-based inquiry that addresses three factors dm ljaypaW gJaI type of regulatory taking has occurred: (1) the economic Mangels 12 to be used in determining whether this
13 | impact of the regulation on the claimant, (2) the extent to which the regulation has interfered with * T 14 distinct investment-backed expectations, and (3) the nature of the governmental action. (Id. at
15 124.)

16 141. As to the first factor, the ban on STRs in the Ojai Valley overlay zone means that
17 the economic impact of the regulation on the claimant is drastic. In all cases (but for the few
18 historically designated properties), 100% of the income obtained from the STR business

19 operations will be eliminated. This has devastating consequences for both homeowners operating
20 the STRs, as well as local businesses in the area who thrive off of tourism from homes being used
21 as STRs. As mentioned above, and in several comment letters, and during public comment at the
22 June 12, 2018 hearing, several property owners will actually lose their homes if unable to operate
23 TRUs in the Ojai Valley.

24 142.. As to the second factor, the investment-backed expectations of the owners and
25 operators of STRs in the Ojai Valley were that they would be able to operate STRs for the
26 foresecable future, as there had been no prior regulations in place prohibiting such a use. Indeed,
27 the Ojai Valley STR operators in particular, due to the more desirable location close to the City of
28 Ojai, had higher investment-backed expectations than in other unincorporated areas of the County.

24 62380800v2
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

The regulation interferes with these investment-backed expectations because the STR use must

2 now stop within 2 years, and there is not enough time for investors to recoup their investment, and
are investors are being deprived of their fundamental vested rights.

143. As to the third factor, the government action in this case specifically calls out Ojai
Valley for the ban, and there is an unexplained, irrational, arbitrary and capricious designation of
this one particular overlay zone to be discriminated against, violating equal protection rights.
7 Furthermore, the procedural irregularities described above deprived STR owners of due process.
144. The three factors of the Penn Central test are therefore easily satisfied, and the
9 TRU Ordinance effectuates regulatory taking upon Petitioner.

11 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION etter apscchel uo er Mangels JMBM& 12 (Petition for Writ of Mandate Under Public Resources Code § 21168.5 and

13 California Code of Civil Procedure § 1085 - Violation of CEQA)

14 145. Petitioner hereby incorporates by this reference the allegations of all previous
15 paragraphs of this Petition as though fully set forth herein.
16 146. In connection with its issuance of the Notice of Exemption claiming the common
17 sense exemption under CEQA Guidelines § 15061(b)(3), Respondent County abused its
18 discretion, did not proceed in the manner required by law, failed to make required findings, and

19 failed to act on the basis of substantial evidence. The County failed to conduct an adequate
20 environmental review process for the Project. Respondent's failures constitute violations of the
21 California Environmental Quality Act.

22 147. Significant or potentially-significant impacts arising from the Project were not
23 adequately identified, analyzed or mitigated. Respondent failed to appropriately analyze the

24 Project's potential environmental impacts.

25 148. Respondent failed to adequately respond to numerous public comments relating to
26 environmental concerns including traffic, greenhouse gases, air quality, and urban decay.
The so-called "common sense exemption" under CEQA, set forth in CEQA 27 149.

28 Guidelines § 15061(b)(3), may only be employed where it is certain that there is no possibility the

62380800v2 25
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 project may cause significant environmental impacts.

2 150. Importantly, the decision to proceed under CEQA Guidelines § 15061(b)(3) must
3 be supported by substantial record evidence. The agency relying upon the exemption bears the
4 burden of proving its applicability. See Davidon Homes v. City of San Jose, 54 Cal. App. 4th 106
5 (1997).

6 151. The County is unable to meet its burden that it is a certainty that there is no
7 possibility of significant environmental impacts.

8 152. There is substantial evidence in the record, including a traffic study prepared by

9 Associated Transportation Engineers (Exhibit 20 to June 19, 2018 hearing agenda for the TRU
10 Ordinance matter) showing the possibility for significant environmental impacts. Furthermore,

er Mangels I letfe lartechve uo INEINS 11 there are numerous comment letters in the record where members of the public urge the County to
12 conduct a CEQA analysis.

13 153. Not only was this evidence not taken into account, it was actively ignored and
•14 brushed aside with no regard for the environmental duties imposed upon the County under CEQA.
15 Indeed, the staff report for the June 12, 2018 hearing boldly proclaims (referring to the Exhibit 20
16 traffic study and related comments) that "these comments and data are not evidence that the
17 County's proposed TRU ordinances may have a significant traffic impact." (p. 9.) In fact, Exhibit
18 20 is exactly that: evidence that the County's proposed TRU ordinances may have a significant
19 traffic impact. That is also exactly what other comment letters have said. Just because the staff
20 report makes an inaccurate proclamation, that does not change the facts. Nor does it change the it
21 extremely stringent legal standard requiring no possibility of a significant environmental impact.
22 154. Furthermore, an ordinance of this magnitude requires a CEQA analysis, starting
23 with an Initial Study, and leading to either a Negative Declaration, Mitigated Negative Declaration
24 or an EIR (in order of magnitude).

25 155. Despite the substantial evidence that was provided showing a possibility of
26 significant environmental impacts, the County summarily dismissed and bypassed all CEQA
27 obligations (including the initial study), in violation of CEQA Guidelines § 15061(b)(3), and §
28 15004(b)(2), and Pub. Res. Code §§ 21067; 21080.1(a); 21083(a).

26 62380800v2
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

156. Petitioner as well as members of the general public will suffer irreparable harm if
2 the relief requested herein is not granted and the TRU Ordinance is allowed to go into effect in the
3 absence of a full and adequate CEQA analysis and absent compliance with all other applicable
provisions of CEQA.

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

(Petition for Writ of Mandate Under California Code of
Civil Procedure § 1085 - Violation of Government Code §65855)
157. Petitioner hereby incorporates by this reference the allegations of all previous

9 paragraphs of this Petition as though fully set forth herein.

10 158. Government Code §65855 provides: "After the hearing, the planning commission

Mangels mPpo C INEINI 11 shall render its decision in the form of a written recommendation to the legislative body. Such
12 recommendation shall include the reasons for the recommendation, the relationship of the
13 proposed ordinance or amendment to applicable general and specific plans, and shall be
14 transmitted to the legislative body in such and manner as may be specified by the legislative
15 body."

16 159. The recommendation given by the Planning Commission after the March 1, 2018
17 hearing did not contain many of the elements required by Government Code §65855, such as 1) an
18 actual recommendation regarding the TRU Ordinance itself, 2) reasons for the recommendation,
19 and 3) the relationship of the proposed ordinance or, amendment to applicable general and specific
20 plans. Therefore, it was an absolute must that the matter go back to the Planning Commission for
21 a formal recommendation compliant with Government Code §65855.

22 160. At the May 1, 2018 Board of Supervisors meeting, the Board of Supervisors chose
23 to bypass the legally required formal recommendation from the Planning Commission, and
24 proceed directly to a Board of Supervisors hearing to approve the matter, in direct violation of
25 Government Code §65855.

26 161. Petitioner as well as members of the general public will suffer irreparable harm if
27 the relief requested herein is not granted and the TRU Ordinance is allowed to go into effect in the
28 absence of a full and adequate CEQA analysis and absent compliance with all other applicable

27 62380800v2
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 provisions of CEQA.

2 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

3 (Declaratory Relief Under Code of Civil Procedure § 1060 -

4

5 Violation of Due Process, Equal Protection, Vested Property Rights, and

6 Regulatory Taking, under the California and United States Constitutions)
162.

7 Petitioner hereby incorporates by this reference the allegations of all previous
paragraphs of this Petition as though fully set forth herein.

8 163. Petitioner has exhausted all applicable nonjudicial remedies.
164. An actual and substantial controversy exists between Petitioner and the County
10 over the lawfulness of the County's TRU Ordinance.

9 11 165.

er & Mitchell Jeffer Mangels For the reasons previously stated, Petitioner asserts that the County's actions,
12 including adopting the TRU Ordinance: 1) violate CEQA, 2) violate Government Code §65855, 3)

Ce TAEINS 13 violate County residents' right to due process under the California and U.S. Constitutions, 4)
14 violate equal protection under the California and U.S. Constitutions, 5) violate vested property
15 rights under the California and U.S. Constitutions, and 6) constitute a regulatory taking under
16 Penn Central.

17 166. On information and belief, the County asserts that its actions, and the TRU
18 Ordinance, do not violate any of the above.

19 167. Therefore, declaratory relief is appropriate.
20 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

21 (Petition for Writ of Mandate Under California Code of

22

23 Civil Procedure 8 1085 - Violation of Government Code § 54950 et. seq.)
168. Petitioner hereby incorporates by this reference the allegations of all previous
24 paragraphs of this Petition as though fully set forth herein.

25 169. Supervisor Bennett produced a record at the hearing which was "distributed less
26 than 72 hours prior to that meeting" and should have been made available to the public at the same
27 time. (Govt. Code § 54957.5(b).)

28 170. Alternatively, the record was "distributed during a public meeting" and should have

62380800v2 28
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

been "made available for public inspection at the meeting" because it was "prepared by a member
2 of [the Board of Supervisors'] legislative body.". (Govt. Code § 54957.5(c).)

3 171. Thus, regardless of whether or not the document was distributed to other board
4 members the day before, or at the meeting itself, there is a violation of either Government Code
5 54957.5(b) or 54957.5(c) respectively.

6 172. The failure to distribute the proposed amendments constituted a failure to conduct

7 an open meeting of the legislative body under Government Code § 54953(a).

8 173. In addition, the County failed to agendize the discussion of the proposed
9 amendments under Government Code § 54954.2, and ignored County Counsel's admonition to

10 reopen the public comment period under Government Code 8 54954.3 when a substantial change
11 I Butier & Mitchell up W was made to the TRU Ordinance by the elimination of "sites of merit" from the exemption to the
12 STR ban in the Ojai Valley.
13 174. Government Code § 54960.1 provides that interested parties may commence an
14 action by mandamus or injunction under the Brown Act for the purpose of obtaining a judicial
15 determination that an action taken by a legislative body of a local agency in violation of the Brown
16 Act is null and void.

17

18 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

19 WHEREFORE, Petitioner pray for relief as follows:

20 1. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondent to set aside the Notice of
21 Exemption and to hold further required public hearings after giving public notice in the manner
22 required by law, in order to come into full compliance with CEQA;

23 2. For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent
24| injunction restraining Respondent and their respective agents, servants and employees from taking
25 any action to implement the TRU Ordinance pending full compliance with CEQA and other state
26 and local laws;

27 3. For a declaration that the County's actions, specifically in enacting the TRU

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

Petitioner TRUOJAI ("Petitioner" or "TRUOJAI") seeks a writ of mandate, declaratory
2 and injunctive relief against Respondent County of Ventura ("County" or "Respondent"), and
3 alleges as follows:

4 INTRODUCTION

5 1.

6 This Petition challenges the County's June 19, 2018 decision to adopt the ordinance

7 entitled, "County-Initiated Proposal to Amend Articles 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 14, and 18 of the Non-
Coastal Zoning Ordinance ("NCZO") (PL 17-0138) to Regulate Temporary Rental Units" (*TRU
8 I| Ordinance").

9 2. The TRU Ordinance puts into place strict compliance regulations (including
10 permitting requirements, inspections, occupancy limits, etc.) for Temporary Rental Units'

| Butler & Mitchell w "D Jeffer Mangels. 11 ("TRUs") throughout the unincorporated areas of the County.

12 3. In addition to those strict compliance regulations, the TRU Ordinance entirely bans

PWANI 13 STRs in the Ojai Valley through an overlay zone, without any justification as to why. the Ojai
14 Valley should be treated any differently than the rest of the County.

15 4. The record before the County in connection with its review and consideration of the
16 TRU Ordinance established that its regulations, including the ban on STRs in the entire Ojai
17 Valley, will result several significant environmental impacts, including, but not limited to: 1)
18 increased traffic and vehicle miles traveled, 2) increased greenhouse gas emissions as a result of
19 the additional vehicle trips, 3) adverse impacts to air quality, and 4) urban decay caused by
20 potentially devastating economic impacts of the TRU Ordinance. This is largely because, with the
21 lack of alternative short-term lodging in the area, banning STRs in the Ojai Valley-a popular
22 visitor serving destination adjacent to the tourist town of Ojai-will force Ojai and Ojai Valley
23 visitors to lodge in Ventura or other further away locations and drive to and from Ojai and the Ojai
24 Valley to enjoy its local charms and attributes. This in turn will result in more vehicle miles
25 traveled and more greenhouse gas and criteria contaminant emissions. Furthermore, the record
26 before the County also established that the loss in business revenue from tourists who are unable

27 1 TRUs is a term that includes both short-term rentals ("STR") as well as homeshares, under the 28 TRU Ordinance.

62254518vl 2
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

to secure alternative lodging and unwilling to make the long trek from areas where lodging is
2 available will cause distressing effects in the business community, which could lead to closures of

3 businesses and urban decay.

5. Prior to enacting the TRU Ordinance, the County was required to comply with the
5 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") by studying and mitigating these significant or
6 potentially-significant environmental impacts and evaluating a range of feasible project
7 alternatives that would avoid these impacts altogether. The County, however, simply dispensed
8 with any CEQA review whatsoever, relying instead on the so-called "common sense exemption"
9 set forth in 14 California Code of Regulations, Section § 15061(b)(3) ("CEQA Guidelines"). This

Pogps er & Mitchell LLP 10  exemption can only be employed to avoid CEQA review where it is certain that there is no

• Mangels 11 possibility a CEQA project under consideration may cause significant environmental impacts.
12 Importantly, the decision to proceed under CEQA Guidelines § 15061(b)(3) must be supported by

WEWI 13 substantial record evidence, and the agency relying upon the exemption bears the burden of
14 proving its applicability.

15 6. The County's action fails to acknowledge the significant environmental impacts
16 that will arise from the passage and enforcement of the TRU Ordinance, and fails to comply with
17 the fundamental information and mitigation dictates of CEQA. The County cannot meet its
18 burden of proving that there is no possibility of significant environmental impacts here. Indeed,
19 the County failed to even conduct the necessary studies that would have analyzed whether or not
20 such environmental impacts exist, and by definition, there is no substantial record evidence
21 supporting the Notice of Exemption based upon CEQA Guidelines § 15061(b)(3).

22 7.

23 8. The County's blatant disregard of its responsibilities under CEQA cannot stand.
In addition to the CEQA violation, the County also failed to comply with State
24 Planning and Zoning Law in connection with its adoption of the TRU Ordinance. Moreover, the
25 TRU Ordinance is facially void because it contravenes principles of equal protection, due process
26 (under both the state and federal constitutions), violates vested property rights, and constitutes a
27 regulatory taking of the distinct investment-backed expectations of those it effects.

28 9.

62254518v1 A writ of mandate and declaratory and injunctive relief should be issued to stop the

3
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

enforcement and effectiveness of the TRU Ordinance, at least until the County fulfills its basic
2 CEQA duty of appropriately analyzing and mitigating the extensive significant environmental

3 impacts identified in the record by countless members of the public, through comment letters and
4 at public hearings.

5 'HE PARTIES

6 10. Petitioner TRUOJAI, LLC is a California limited liability company and community
7 advocacy group composed of individuals and entities who own and operate real property and
8 improvements in the Ojai Valley area of the County and are concerned with the environmental

9 impacts of the TRU Ordinance at issue in this Petition upon their properties and the surrounding
10 community.

11 11. Defendant County of Ventura is a county of the State of California existing under 3 Butler & Mitchell sjeBuew Jayaf- 12 the Constitution of the State of California with the capacity to sue and be sued. As used herein,
13 the term "County" includes, but is not limited to, the Board of Supervisors, the Planning
TNES 14 Commission, County employees, agents, officers, boards, commissions, departments, and their
15 members, all equally charged with complying with duties under the County Municipal Code, and
16 with the laws of the State.

17 12. Petitioner does not know the true names or capacities, whether individual,
18 corporate, associate or otherwise, of Respondent Does 1 through 25, inclusive, and therefore sues
19 said Respondents under fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this Petition to show their true

20 names and capacities when and if the same have been ascertained.

21 JURISDICTION, VENUE AND EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

22 13. This Court has jurisdiction under Public Resources Code co. 21168.5 and California
23 Code of Civil Procedure § 1085.

24 14. Venue is proper in this Court because the causes of action alleged in this Petition
25 arose in Ventura County, and all parties are located or do business in Ventura County.

26 15. Petitioner complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code § 21167.5 and
27 California Code of Civil Procedure §-388 by serving on Respondent County written notice of
28 Petitioner's intention to commence this action on July 26, 2018. A copy of the proof of service is

4 62254518v1
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

attached hereto as Exhibit A.

16. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing the instant action, and

3 has exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.
Petitioner appeared before the County prior to the adoption of the TRU Ordinance and objected

thereto.

17. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedies in the ordinary course of the
law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate and requires Respondent County to set

8 aside its adoption of the TRU Ordinance until appropriate CEQA review is undertaken.
THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT

10 18. CEQA, found at Public Resources Code Section 21000, et seq., is based upon the
11 principle that "the maintenance of a quality environment for the people of this state now and in the dn jpupan g Jpng 3 NENE 12 future is a matter of statewide concern." (Pub. Res. Code § 21000(a).)
13 19. In CEQA, the Legislature has established procedures designed to achieve these
14 goals-principally, the Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"). These procedures provide both for
15 the determination and for full public disclosure of the potential adverse effects on the environment
16 of discretionary projects that governmental agencies propose to approve, and require a description
17 of feasible alternatives to such proposed projects and feasible mitigation measures to lessen their
18  environmental harm. (Pub. Res. Code § 21002.)

19 20. CEQA is not merely a procedural statute; it imposes clear and substantive
20 responsibilities on agencies that propose to approve projects, requiring that public agencies not
21 approve projects that harm the environment unless and until all feasible mitigation measures are

22 employed to minimize that harm. (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002, 21002.1(b).)

23 21. CEQA defines a project as "the whole of an action, which has a potential for
24 resulting in either a direct physical change to the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect

25 physical change in the environment." (CEQA Guidelines § 15378(a).) In this case, the project is
26 the passage of the TRU Ordinance.

27 22. Failure either to comply with the substantive requirements of CEQA or to carry out
28 the full CEQA procedures so that complete information as to a project's impacts is developed and

5 62254518v1
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 publicly disclosed constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion that requires invalidation of the

2 public agency action regardless of whether full compliance would have produced a different result.
3 (Pub. Res. Code § 21005.)

23. The CEQA Guidelines establish procedures for calculating the  baseline
4A environmental conditions, including a description of the physical environmental conditions in the 4

6 vicinity of the project, as they exist at the time the notice of preparation is published, or if no
analysis is commenced. 7 notice of preparation is published, at the time of the environmental
8 (CEQA Guidelines § 15125(a).)

24. Agencies may not undertake actions that could potentially have a. significant
10 adverse effect on the environment, or limit the choice of alternatives or mitigation measures,
before complying with CEQA. (CEQA Guidelines § 15004(b)(2).) The "lead agency," the public dt jjeypuw gJepna sjesuew Jaya- 12 agency that has the principal responsibility for carrying out the project, is responsible for 11

13 conducting an initial study to determine, in consultation with other relevant state and local
14 agencies, whether an environmental impact report, a negative declaration, or a mitigated negative

must be WaNS 15 declaration will be prepared for a project. (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21067; 21080.1(a); 21083(a).)
16 25. "All phases of project planning, implementation, and operation"
17  considered in the Initial Study for project. (CEQA Guidelines § 15063(a)(1).)

18 26. After an Initial Study, an EIR must be prepared "[i]f there is substantial evidence,
19 in light of the whole record before the lead agency, that the project may have a significant effect
20  on the environment. . . ." (Pub. Res. Code § 21080(d).) That is, an EIR must be prepared "if a lead
fair argument that the project may have a significant effect on the
22 environment even though it may also be presented with other substantial evidence that the 21 agency is presented with

25 minimizing environmental damage where feasible. As part of this responsibility, public agencies 24 The CEQA Guidelines charge public agencies with the responsibility of avoiding or

26 are required to balance various public objectives, including economic, environmental, and social
27 issues. CEQA review is integral to that process, informing decision-makers and the general public
28 what significant environmental effects might a result from a proposed project. In addition, the

2 alternatives to the project.

3 28. In this case, the County has decided to forego the entire CEQA process that is
4 normally undertaken -for a legislative action of this magnitude, and has instead purported to

5 implement the "common sense exemption" under CEQA Guidelines section 15061(b)(3). Under
6 the terms of the exemption, the evidence must support an agency determination that "it can be
7 seen with a certainty a that there is no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant

8 effect on the environment." (Id.)

29. In other words, the County did not undertake an Initial Study to determine, in

ler & Mitchell LLP 10 consultation with other relevant state and local agencies, whether an environmental impact report,

Mangels a negative declaration, or a mitigated negative declaration will be prepared for the project. As
12 such, the County also did not undertake any of those three environmental analysis options under

#3 13 CEQA.

15 environmental impacts relating to vehicle traffic, air quality, greenhouse gases, and urban decay,

17  ignoring the legal standard, which would require CEQA analysis even if there a is a possibility of
18 significant effect on the environment.

20 A. FACTS COMMON TO ALL CAUSES OF ACTION
PROCEDURAL HISTORY

21 31. On July 28, 2015, the Board of Supervisors directed staff to study the issue of
22 TRUs in the unincorporated areas of the County. (March 1, 2018 Planning Commission Staff

23 Report for PL 17-0138, p. 2.)

24 32.

25 and in From December 2015 to December 2016, the Board conducted 3 public workshops,

response to staff analysis and public testimony, the Board directed staff to develop options
26 for regulating TRUs based on. three objectives, in order of priority: 1) quality of life in
27 neighborhoods must be maintained; 2) supply of housing for purchase and/or long-term rental
28 should not be significantly reduced; and 3) TRUs should enhance the local economy. (Id.)

62254518v1 7
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

33. Ultimately, the Board directed staff to prepare zoning ordinance amendments to
2 require the following: 1) Allow TRUs in residential zones with a ministerial permit subject to

3 regulations, and 2) in the Ojai Valley, prohibit TRUs except in historic properties, and phase out

4 existing Ojai Valley TRUs that are properly registered and paying transient occupancy taxes, (Id.
5 at p. 3.)

6 34. From the very beginning of the process, when the Board was first directing staff to
7 prepare the TRU Ordinance, it had already singled out the Ojai Valley for special disparate

8 treatment.

9 35. In or around December 2017, the Ojai Area Municipal Advisory Committee
10 ("MAC") held a hearing in respect to the proposed TRU Ordinance: At the conclusion of the

IVL| Butler & Mitchell LILP 11 hearing, the MAC Board recommended that STRs not be banned in the Ojai Valley as was being
NEINL 12 proposed at the time.

13 36. County Planning staff eventually drafted the TRU Ordinance by March 1, 2018,
14 when it went before the Planning Commission for hearing. (Id.)

15 37. The following is a summary of some of the notable regulations and standards in the
16 TRU Ordinance:

17 Establishes definitions for "short-term rental" (rental of a home for under 30 days) and

18 "homeshare" (home where occupant is present, and rents out a portion of the home),

19 and identifies them as accessory uses to dwellings requiring a ministerial permit
20 Establishes ownership requirements and limitations (e.g. only one TRU per owner)

21 Defines ineligible dwellings (e.g. permitted accessory dwelling units)

22 Establishes an overlay zone over the Ojai Valley that effectively bans all STRs,

23 except those on historic landmark properties.

24 Establishes a 2 year amortization period (or grace period) for existing TRU uses
25 which do not meet eligibility requirements.

26 Limits permits to year in duration

27 Sets overnight occupancy limits at 2 persons per bedroom, plus 2 others

28 Establishes on-site parking requirements and noise limitations

. Prohibits on-site events

2 Specifies property management and complaint response requirements
Establishes a complete inspection, compliance, and enforcement program
(June 12, 2018 Board of Supervisors Staff Report, p. 4)

38. It is significant that all of the regulations imposed by the TRU Ordinance are of

6 general applicability to the County as a whole, except for the overlay zone banning STRs in the
Ojai Valley only (except for historical properties).

39. On March 1, 2018, when the TRU Ordinance was brought before the Planning
Commission, there was ample discussion regarding the STR limitation in Ojai Valley and the
10 concentration of STRs in other areas of the unincorporated county. (Id. at p. 5.)

11 40. The Planning Commission preferred that there be some numeric or density-based mn jjaupuw g Japng sjeBuey Jayaf 3 WENÍ 12 limit on STRs across the entire unincorporated area instead of a strict limit in the Ojai Valley and

13 no limit elsewhere in the County, as directed by the Board. (Id. at p. 5.)
14 41. The Planning Commission expressed significant discomfort with the recommended
15 STR limitations/prohibitions in the Ojai Valley and the lack of any numeric limitations in other
16 unincorporated areas of the County, (Id.)

17 42. The Planning Commission did not find that the information provided by staff
18 supported treating the Ojai Valley differently than the remainder of the unincorporated area, nor
19 did they find that the impacts of high numbers of STRs on neighborhood character in other areas
20 were adequately addressed. (Id.)

21 43. As result, the Planning Commission directed Planning Division staff to conduct
22 additional analysis and develop alternate regulations for the Planning Commission's consideration
23 that include numeric and/or density-based limits for the STRs ("the Density Analysis") across the
24 unincorporated County. (Id.)

25 44. The issue of the Planning Commission's recommendation regarding the Density
26 Analysis went before the Board of Supervisors on May 1, 2018. (Id.)

27 45. The staff report for the May 1, 2018 hearing explained that $25,000 to $30,000 was
28 needed to conduct the Density Analysis. (May 1, 2018 Board of Supervisors Staff Report, p. 4.)

9 62254518v1
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

46. The staff report also (mistakenly) explained that if the Board does not approve the
2 budget for the Density Analysis, then it could either 1) send the matter back to the Planning

3 Commission for a formal updated recommendation regarding the existing draft TRU Ordinance, or
4 2) skip that step and just direct the staff to schedule a public hearing for the Board's consideration
5 of the existing draft TRU Ordinance. (Id.)

6 47. The first alternative above - sending the matter back to the Planning Commission
was the only legal option available to the Board pursuant to 7 for a formal recommendation

8 Government Code §65855.

48. The second alternative presented in the May 1, 2018 staff report is contrary to law,
10 because the Government Code §65855 provides: "After the hearing, the planning commission
11 shall render its decision in the form of a written recommendation to the legislative body. dT 4paN g Japng TAT Od NEINI 12 Such recommendation shall include the reasons for the recommendation, the relationship of
13 the proposed ordinance or amendment to applicable general and specific plans, and shall be
14 transmitted to the legislative body in such and manner as may be specified by the legislative
15 body." (emphasis added.)

16 49. The recommendation given by the Planning Commission after the March 1, 2018
17 hearing did not contain many of the elements required by Government Code §65855, such as 1) an
18 actual recommendation regarding the TRU Ordinance itself, 2) reasons for the recommendation,
19 and-3) the relationship of the proposed ordinance or amendment to applicable general and specific
20 plans. Therefore, it was an absolute must that the matter go back to the Planning Commission for

21 formal recommendation compliant with Government Code §65855.

22 50. At the May 1, 2018 Board meeting, the Board of Supervisors rejected the Density
23 Analysis, and chose to proceed with the illegal alternative presented by staff - bypass the legally
24 required formal recommendation from the Planning Commission, and proceed directly to a Board
25 of Supervisors hearing to approve the matter. (June 12, 2018 Board of Supervisors Staff Report, p.
26 5)

27 51. Furthermore, in lieu of the Density Analysis, the Board directed staff to identify
28 other options for addressing concerns regarding the treatment of legal nonconforming TRUs. (ld.)

10 62254518v1
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

52. The short 2 year amortization period had been identified in several comment letters

As 2 as a serious problem that would infringe on vested property rights of various TRU owners.
such, the expansion of the amortization period to allow for a longer period of time for owners to
4 recoup their investment was seen as an alternative method by which a just result could be
achieved, without having to conduct the Density Analysis.

53. As a result of this direction, staff drafted and presented 4 options to the Board, all
of which expanded the scope of the amortization period, and/or gave additional rights to non-
8 conforming TRUs ("Amortization Options"). (Id. at pp. 5-8.)
54. On June 12, 2018, the County set the TRU Ordinance for hearing, including the 4
10 Amortization Options. (Id.)

11 55. Dozens of members of the public spoke out at the June 12, 2018 urging the Board m IpyPuW gapng | TAT NENI 12 to either adopt one of the Amortization Options, or vote against the adoption of the TRU

13 Ordinance.

14 56. Public comments included various references to significant environmental impacts,
15  including: 1) traffic exacerbation and vehicle miles traveled (which leads to associated greenhouse

16 gas emissions and air quality issues), and 2) economic devastation of businesses that could lead to
17 urban decay.

18 57. The subject of environmental impacts, however, was not a factor in the discussion
19 during the Board's deliberation period. Rather, the Board was focused on putting the final touches
20 on the TRU Ordinance draft in order to pass it as quickly as possible, including the Ojai Valley
21 overlay zone.

22 58. At the June 12, 2018 hearing, Supervisor Bennett distributed to the other board
23 members a draft of amendments to the ordinance that he had proposed the day before (according

24 to his own public statement). (Video of June 12, 2018 meeting, available on the County website.)

25 59. Those amendments were not made available to the public for review or comment
26 prior to the hearing.

27 60. At some point during the deliberations, the last minute changes from Supervisor
28 Bennett that were not available to the public sparked a comment from Supervisor Foy: "Do we

11 62254518v1
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

really have to go over this now, or just wait a week and let it all be written and put it in one? ... He

2 [Bennett] just keeps adding different things to it." (Video of June 12, 2018 meeting at 8:42:12,

3 available on the County website.)

61. The Board did not take action on June 12, 2018 on the TRU Ordinance, but rather,
5 continued the matter to June 19, 2018, but without reopening public comment.

6 62. Counsel for TRU OJAI sent a letter on June 14, 2018 advising the Board of
7 Supervisors of procedural irregularities described above, and the violations of due process and the

8 Brown Act2 that are implicated by deliberations on documents not provided to the public.
63. Yet, rather than making the document available to the public, and re-opening the
10 matter for public comment (which would have been extremely easy to do, given the timing, and

tler & Mitchell uLP 11 given the fact that the Board had not taken action yet), the Board continued the matter to June 19,
Jeffer Mangels 12 2018 without giving the public an opportunity to comment on the secret last-minute draft

4Poe 13 distributed by Supervisor Bennett.
-E  NEN 14 64. Indeed, far be it from taking the opportunity to inform the public, the County
15 doubled down on the Brown Act violation in a response letter on June 15, 2018, admitting that
16 "Supervisor Bennett thereafter created the document he distributed on June 12…so that his
17 proposed changes would be shown on the latest staff recommended version of the TRU
18 Ordinance."

19 65. The document distributed by Supervisor Bennett was not available to the public at
20 the June 12, 2018 hearing. Neither counsel for TRU OJAI, nor the dozens of members of TRU
21 OJAI, nor the public at large (all of whom were confused regarding what was happening in real
22 time when Supervisor Bennett was distributing documents to other Board members) had the
23 opportunity to see the document, or comment publicly upon it. Indeed, the Supervisor Bennet
24  distributed the document to the other Supervisors after the close of public comment, perhaps
25 specifically to avoid public comment on such procedural irregularities.

26 66. At the June 19, 2018 hearing, Supervisor Bennett, referring to an anonymous letter
27

28 Counsel for TRU OJAI has separately sent a cure and correct demand under the Brown Act.

62254518v1 12
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

P that had been submitted back on June 8, 2018, decided to also strike "sites of merit" from the
2 properties that would be exempt from the STR ban in Ojai Valley, tightening the chokehold on the
3 Ojai Valley restriction on STRs.

4 67. Action was taken on June 19, 2018 to approve the TRU Ordinance, with no further

5 opportunity given to the public to comment on the eleventh hour amendments.

6 68. On June 19, 2018, the Board voted to adopt the TRU Ordinance.

7 69. Importantly, the TRU Ordinance was adopted without incorporation of any of the 4
8 Amortization Options. Recall that the Board of Supervisors discarded the Planning Commission's
recommendation for a Density Analysis, and instead asked the staff to set the TRU Ordinance for
10 hearing 4 with 4 Amortization Options, in order to resolve some of those problems. Then, when it

Butler & Mitchell uip e 11 came time for the vote, none of those 4 Amortization Options were adopted, and therefore, the
12 original problems that were identified by the Planning Commission (and a large contingent of the
13 general public) were never resolved.

14 70. On June 21, 2018, the County recorded the Notice of Exemption ("NOE") for the
15  project.

16 71. The NOE lists the exempt status as "Categorical Exemption."

17 72. The NOE provides that the justification for exemption is as follows: "Case No. PL
18 17-0138 is exempt from California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) review pursuant to CEQA
19 Guidelines Section 15061(b)(3), because the amendments would not cause any physical change
20 and therefore could not have a significant effect on the environment."

21 B. THE COUNTY FAILED TO COMPLY WITH CEQA

22 73. There is an abundance of comments in the record (both orally, and in writing)
23| regarding citizens' concerns for the environmental impacts of the TRU Ordinance.

24 74. Comments even included a traffic study from Associated Transportation Engineers
25 (*ATE Study", Exhibit 20 to the June 12 and June 19, 2018 staff reports) entitled "Short-Term
26 Rentals and Increased Traffic -- Is There a Connection?" The ATE Study "reviews the traffic
27 effects of providing short term rentals within residential neighborhoods in Ventura County, with a
28 specific focus on the Ojai Valley area.'

13 62254518v1
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

pd 75. The ATE Study concludes that STRs generate less traffic than a traditional single
2 family unit, and that STRs generate significantly less peak hour traffic, and that the majority of
3 trips generated by STRs are local in nature (as opposed to residents who have to commute to work
4 during peak times).

5 76. The ATE Study, and the dozens of public commenters, raised the possibility that
6 there would be significant traffic impacts. Traffic impacts (including increased vehicle miles
7 traveled) also form the basis for other significant environmental impacts such as greenhouse gas
8 emissions, and air quality.

9 77. Also, the economic impacts of the project are potentially devastating to local

1l Butler & Mitchell LLP 10 businesses, which could cause the closing of businesses, which in turn, could create urban decay.

11 78.

WENI Yet, these comments fell on deaf ears, and the Board illegally issued the NOE,
12 despite the fact that there is no way that they could meet the legal standard for the exemption that
13 they claimed: "where it is certain that there is no possibility the project may cause significant
14 environmental impacts." CEQA Guidelines § 15061(b)(3)

15 79. An ordinance of this magnitude requires CEQA analysis, starting with an Initial
16 Study, and leading to either a Negative Declaration, Mitigated Negative Declaration or an EIR.

17 80. Despite the substantial eyidence that was provided showing a possibility of
18 significant environmental impacts, the County summarily dismissed and bypassed all CEQA
19 obligations, in violation of CEQA Guidelines § 15061(b)(3), and § 15004(b)(2), and Pub. Res.
20 Code §§ 21067; 21080.1(a); 21083(a).

21 81. Furthermore, the fact that the County passed the TRU Ordinance without
22 conducting the Density Analysis, by definition, means that there was not substantial evidence to
23 support the ban in the Ojai Valley overlay zone, as opposed to some other density-based metric
24 that could be a employed on a County-wide basis (as recommended by the Planning Commission).

25 82. Finally, the three purported objectives of the TRU Ordinance, in order of priority,
26 are: 1) quality of life in neighborhoods must be maintained; 2) supply of housing for purchase
27 and/or long-term rental should not be significantly reduced; and 3) TRUs should enhance the local
28 economy, (March 1, 2018 Planning Commission Staff Report for PL 17-0138, p. 2.)

62254518v1 14
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

support that the ban in Ojai Valley would accomplish any 83. There is no evidence to

2 of those objectives.

3 84. As to the first objective, the quality of life is addressed through the permitting,

4 monitoring, and enforcement mechanisms provided throughout the TRU Ordinance. The ban in
5 Ojai Valley is inapplicable to the quality of life.

of 0 85. As to the second objective, there is no evidence in the record (either by way

7 analyses, studies, or other scientific means) that Ojai Valley STRs would "significantly reduce"
8 the supply of housing for purchase or rent.

86. Third, the ban in Ojai Valley would actually go directly contrary to the goal of
10 enhancing the local economy. Countless STR operators, citizens and business owners noted the

sn Ieypaw gJepna 11 negative economic impacts that would come with a ban.
THE COUNTY FAILED TO COMPLY WITH GOVERNMENT CODE $ 65855 sje8uew Jayaf 12 C.

13 87. When the Planning Commission on March 1, 2018 directed that the Density
WENI 14 Analysis be conducted by planning staff, it did not undertake the exercise of making a
15 recommendation that complies with Government Code $65855. Rather, it simply directed staff to
16 undertake the Density Analysis. (June 12, 2018 staff report to Board of Supervisors, pp. 4-5.)

18 shall render its decision in the form of a written recommendation to the legislative body. Such 17 88. Government Code §65855 provides: "After the hearing, the planning commission

19 recommendation shall include the reasons for the recommendation, the relationship of the
20 proposed ordinance or amendment to applicable general and specific plans, and shall be
21 transmitted to the legislative body in such and manner as may be specified by the legislative
22 body."

24 hearing did not contain many of the elements required by Government Code §65855, such as 1) an 23 89. The recommendation given by the Planning Commission after the March 1, 2018

25 actual recommendation regarding the TRU Ordinance itself, 2) reasons for the recommendation,
26 and 3) the relationship of the proposed ordinance or amendment to applicable general and specific
27 plans. Therefore, it was an absolute must that the matter go back to the Planning Commission for
28 a formal recommendation compliant with Government Code §65855.

15 62254518v1
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

90. At the May 1, 2018 Board meeting, the Board of Supervisors chose to bypass the
legally required formal recommendation from the Planning Commission, and proceed directly to a
Board of Supervisors hearing to approve the matter, in direct violation of Government Code

4 §65855.

6 D. THE COUNTY VIOLATED COUNTY RESIDENTS' DUE PROCESS RIGHTS

91. The California Constitution provides that, "a person may not be deprived of life,

8 liberty, or property without due process of law or denied equal protection of the laws." (Cal.
Const. Art. 1, § 7(a).)

10 92. The United States Constitution also provides that a state cannot "deprive any

9 11 person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law." (United States Constitution,
• Mangels IPpt3, ooe WAT 12 amend. XIV, § 1.)

13 93. 'The County violated County residents' right to due process given the procedural
14 irregularities that took place at the June 12, 2018 and June 19, 2018 hearings. Among other
15 things, Supervisor Bennett distributed a document that was not made available to the public in
16 advance of the hearing (or concurrently with the hearing).
17 94. The Board proceeded to deliberate regarding that newly-created and newly.
18 distributed document, much to the confusion of everyone who was in the audience at the hearing,

19 who were therefore deprived of their due process rights to comment upon and address the
20 proposed ordinance revisions.

21 E. THE TRU ORDINANCE VIOLATES EQUAL PROTECTION

22 95. The California Constitution provides that, "a person may not be deprived of life,
23 liberty, or property without due process of law or denied equal protection of the laws." Cal.
24 Const. Art. 1, § 7(a).

25 96. The U.S. Constitution also prohibits the denial of equal protection through the
26 fourteenth amendment. United States Constitution, amend. XIV, § 1, and 42 USC section 1983.

27 97. The County must have a rational basis for treating Ojai Valley differently than
28 other unincorporated areas of the County.

62254518vl 16
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

98. The rational basis test requires that the classification be a demonstrably effective
2 means for furthering some actual valid government interest. (E.g., City of Cleburne v. Cleburne
Living Center (1985) 473 U.S. 432, 440.)

99. Here, the Planning Commission understood that the County lacked a rational basis a

upon which it could recommend singling out Ojai Valley in an overlay zone, and instead,

6 recommended that a Density Study take place to treat everyone in the County equally, and make
regulations based on actual density data (as opposed to arbitrary lines).

100. Indeed, according to the County's own June 12, 2018 staff report, the Planning
expressed "significant discomfort with the recommended STR Commission

10 limitations/prohibitions in the Ojai Valley and the lack of any numeric limitations in other areas of

, NEINL 11 the County." (June 12, 2018 staff report to Board of Supervisors, p. 5.)
12 101. The Planning Commission "did not find that the information provided by staff
13 supported treating the Ojai Valley differently than the remainder of the unincorporated area, nor
14 did they find that the impacts of high numbers of STRs on neighborhood character in other areas
15 were adequately addressed." (Id.)

16 102. Yet, despite the express acknowledgement by the Planning Commission of these
17 equal protection concerns, the Board simply enacted the TRU Ordinance, including the overlay
18 zone in Ojai Valley (banning STRs in all but historically designated properties).

19 103. There is no rational basis for treating the Ojai Valley differently than other
20 similarly situated unincorporated areas of the County. Indeed, the Density Analysis was never
21 undertaken.

22 104. Because of the County's hasty decision to pass the TRU Ordinance without doing
23 the Density Analysis, by definition, it did not have any evidence to support its decision regarding
24 the ban on STRs in the Ojai Valley through the overlay zone.

25 F. THE TRU ORDINANCE 2-YEAR AMORTIZATION PERIOD VIOLATES
26 VESTED PROPERTY RIGHTS

27 105. Despite the ban on STRs in Ojai Valley, current STR property owners and

28 operators will retain constitutionally-protected rights to maintain the use. Legal nonconforming

62254518v1 17
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 usesi.e., "grandfathered" uses-are lawful uses that were in place prior to the adoption of the
2 current zoning ordinance. (See Bauer V. City of San Diego, 75 Cal. App. 4th 1281, 1292-93
3 (1999).)

4 106. Governmental entities may not apply newly-enacted zoning ordinances, such as the
5 proposed TRU ordinance, to close businesses lawfully operating or shutter properties lawfully
6 used at the time those ordinances became effective. (See id. at 1292; see also Hansen Brothers

7

8 Enters., Inc. v. Bd. of Supervisors, 12 Cal . 4th 533, 552 (1996); Livingston Rock and Gravel Co.

9 y. County of Los Angeles, 43.Cal. 2d 121, 127 (1954) ("The rights of the users of property as those
rights existed under prevailing zoning conditions are well recognized and have always been
10 protected.").)

dT jeypaw g Japng 11 107.

Jeffer Mangels Even the County's zoning ordinances protect lawfully-established uses against
12 changes in zoning regulations. NCZO § 8113-10.3(a) provides: If [a] use or structure affected [by

13

JMBM 14 change in a zoning ordinance] is existing lawfully as a permitted or conditionally permitted use
or structure, the existing use or structure is hereby deemed to be conforming without any further
15 action."

16 108. STR property owners and operators also have federally- and state-protected vested
17 rights to maintain currently-lawful uses of their property. Under Avco Community Developers,
18 Inc. V. South Coast Regional Comm 'n, 17 Cal. 3d 785 (1976), a property owner that has incurred
19 substantial liabilities establishing a lawful use of property obtains a vested right to continue the
20 use despite a subsequent change in zoning law. This rule parallels the common law vested rights
21 doctrine. (See Halaco Engineering Co. v. South Central Coast Regional Comm'n. 42 Cal. 3d 52,
22 57 (1986) (recognizing vested rights to maintain non-conforming use without obtaining a permit to
23 do so from the Regional Commission); Calvert v. County of Yuba, 145 Cal. App. 4th 613, 623
24 (2006) (nonconforming uses provide the basis for vested rights as to such uses).)

25 109. A zoning ordinance that requires immediate discontinuance of a vested,
26 nonconforming use existing when the ordinance was adopted is a deprivation of property without
27 due process of law. (Santa Barbara Patients' Collective Health Co-op. v. City of Santa Barbara,
28  911 F. Supp. 2d 884, 893 (C.D. Cal. 2012); McCaslin v. City of Monterey Park, 163 Cal. App. 2d

62254518vl 18
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 339 346 (1958).)

2 110. If the law effects an unreasonable interference with an existing use, or a planned

3 use for which a substantial investment in development costs has been made, the ordinance may
4 not be applied to that property unless compensation is paid. (See Hansen Bros., 12 Cal. 4th at
5 551-52.) For this reason, "[z]oning ordinances and other land-use regulations customarily exempt

6 existing uses to avoid questions as to the constitutionality of their application to those uses." (See

7 id. at 552; see also Calvert, 145 Cal. App. 4th at 623 (existing uses must be exempted or
8 amortized over time to avoid unconstitutional deprivations of vested rights).)

111. The TRU Ordinance does not exempt existing uses, but instead, contains an
10  unusual and unnecessarily aggressive "amortization period") requiring STR owners and operators

er Mangels - & Mitchell u *epe 3 NENE 11 to cease STR use within 2 years.

12 112. An ordinance that provides an amortization period, rather than protecting or
13 grandfathering existing uses, is constitutionally suspect because it ultimately results in the
14 extinction of a vested propcrty right. Thus, ordinances requiring amortization must be carefully
15 designed so that the period provided is both (1) adequate to ensure that affected property owners
16 may spread the loss of their present beneficial uses of property over time; and (2) flexible enough
17 to account for individual circumstances. The TRU Ordinance is neither.

18 113. In particular, the TRU Ordinance bans STRs within the overlay zone, which
19 corresponds to the jurisdictional boundaries of the Ojai Valley Municipal Advisory Council, and
20 only allows 2 years to cease all STRs in that area.

21 114. There are no data or economic studies analyzing or justifying this hyper-aggressive
22 2-year amortization period. Indeed, the Board eschewed the Planning Commission's reasonable
23 request for the Density Analysis, and instead, adopted a 2-year amortization period, which appears
24 to have been arbitrarily chosen with no real consideration as to whether it would provide an
25 amortization period commensurate with the investments of current STR property owners.

26 The proposed TRU Ordinance refers to this as a "grace period." The appropriate term is 27 "amortization period" because it is intended (and constitutionally compelled where existing uses are not "grandfathered") to allow a property owner to recoup his or her investment in a use that is 28| prohibited by newly-adopted zoning regulation.

62254518v1 19
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

115. What makes the 2-year amortization period truly unusual is that the NCZO already
contains an amortization provision applicable to all nonconforming uses throughout the County.

3 That provision is set forth in NCZO § 8113-5.4, which provides that nonconforming uses within

4 structures such as houses: "shall be amortized…based on the square footage of the structure at the

5 time the use is rendered nonconforming, as follows: Ten (10) years for one thousand (1,000)
6 square feet, plus one and one-quarter (1.25) years for each additional one hundred (100) square

7 feet over one thousand (1,000) square feet; maximum sixty (60) years."

8 116. Thus, by contrast to the TRU Ordinance amortization period, which is applicable
only to STRs and provides maximum 2-years, the County's normal (and much more typical)
10  amortization period for nonconforming uses within structures is a minimum of 10 years, and up
11 E lPl3, ope Jeffer Mangels 3I INEIND to 60 years. Amortization periods for nonconforming uses generally run much longer-indeed
12 orders of magnitude longer-than the 2-year period provided by the current draft ordinance.
13 117. There is no rationale that can justify a 10- to 60-year amortization period for non-
14 STR uses, including all of the conceivable nonconforming nuisance uses that may exist in the
15 County, and only a 2-year amortization period for STRs.

16 118. Amortization periods must be justified by the public need for the deprivation of
17 property interests they result in. Here, the justification for the proposed STR ban in Ojai Valley is
18 exceedingly thin, because the County recognizes that STRs are not inherently injurious to the
19 public welfare, as the TRU Ordinance continues to permit the use in most parts of the County and
20 singles out only Ojai Valley property owners for disparate treatment.

21 119. Also, no showing has been made as to why the supposed ills of STR use are not
22 entirely addressed by the robust permitting, inspection and enforcement regime imposed by the

23 proposed ordinance in the areas of the County where STR use would remain lawful.

24 120. Unlike amortization ordinances that affect commercial or industrial uses operating
25 within incompatible zones, the TRU Ordinance has direct and immediate impacts on the ability of
26 Ventura County residents to use-and in many circumstances keep-their own homes.
27 121. If no public interest is served by a particular application of an amortization period,
28 the provision is unconstitutional as applied to that particular property. As with any exercise of the

62254518v1 20
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 police power, a reasonable expectation of public benefit must outweigh the harm an amortization
2 ordinance causes an individual. Therefore, the owner of a nonconforming use must at least be
3 allowed a reasonable opportunity to recover the original cost of his or her investment.

4 122. The amortization period here is not sufficient in the vast majority of cases to permit
5 Ojai Valley property owners to recoup and protect their investments and will effect a taking of

6 their properties without just compensation. (See. e.g., City of La Mesa v. Tweed & Gambrell

7 Planning Mill, 146 Cal. App. 2d 762 (1956) (five-year amortization period applied to building
8 with estimated remaining economic life of twenty years invalid); see also National Advertising
Co. v. Monterey County, 1 Cal. 3d 875 (1970) (removal of nonconforming use must await
10 expiration of reasonable amortization period to permit property owner to recover original cost).)

11 123. What is more, recognizing that individual circumstances vary and that flexibility is Mangels m lpapklt, ooys WENE 12 required to ensure that the necessary amortization period is commensurate with individual
13 investments, the NCZO currently contains a mechanism for a property owner to obtain an
14 administrative determination to lengthen an amortization period in individual cases. Thus, NCZO

15 8113-5.4 allows the County's Planning Division to issue a continuation permit where
16 continuation is "not is detrimental to the public interest, health, safety, convenience, or welfare."

17 124. In contrast, the TRU Ordinance contains no similar mechanism for extending the
18 strict 2-year amortization period even where the period fails to provide a property owner with
19 sufficient time to recoup an investment and where allowing the continued use would not be
20 || detrimental to the public welfare. The proposed extinction of property rights requires, at a
21 minimum, that the targeted property owners be afforded some measure of due process in the form

22 of an administrative hearing. The proposed TRO ordinance provides none, leaving property

23 owners with only one recourse to obtain redress for the constitutional injury: the courts.

24 F. THE TRU ORDINANCE EFFECTUATES A REGULATORY TAKING

25 125. Under Penn Central Transportation Company V. City of New York (1978) 438 US
26 104, even if a governmental regulation does not cause a physical invasion or deprive a landowner
27 of all economically beneficial use, it may nonetheless go too far in placing what should be a public
28 burden on private shoulders.

21 62254518vI
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

126. Penn Central established an ad hoc, fact-based inquiry that addresses three factors
to be used in determining whether this type of regulatory taking has occurred: (1) the economic

3 impact of the regulation on the claimant, (2) the extent to which the regulation has interfered with

4 distinct investment-backed expectations, and (3) the nature of the governmental action. (Id. at

5 124.)

127. As to the first factor, the ban on STRs in the Ojai Valley overlay zone means that

7 the economic impact of the regulation on the claimant is drastic. In all cases (but for the few
8 historically designated properties), 100% of the income obtained from the STR business
operations will be eliminated. This has devastating consequences for both homeowners operating
10 the STRs, as well as local businesses in the area who thrive off of tourism from homes being used

11 as STRs. As mentioned above, and in several comment letters, and during public comment at the WENI 12 June 12, 2018 hearing, several property owners will actually lose their homes if unable to operate
13 TRUs in the Ojai Valley.

14 128. As to the second factor, the investment-backed expectations of the owners and
15 operators of STRs in the Ojai Valley were that they would be able to operate STRs for the
16 foreseeable future, as there had been no prior regulations in place prohibiting such a use. Indeed, a
17 the Ojai Valley STR operators in particular, due to the more desirable location close to the City of
18 Ojai, had higher investment-backed expectations than in other unincorporated areas of the County.
19 The regulation interferes with these investment-backed expectations because the STR use must
20 now stop within 2 years, and there is not enough time for investors to recoup their investment, and
21 are investors are being deprived of their fundamental vested rights.

22 129. As to the third factor, the government action in this case specifically calls out Ojai
23 Valley for the ban, and there is an unexplained, irrational, arbitrary and capricious designation of
24 this one particular overlay zone to be discriminated against, violating equal protection rights.
25 Furthermore, the procedural irregularities described above deprived STR owners of due process.

26 130. The three factors of the Penn Central test are therefore easily satisfied, and the
27 TRU Ordinance effectuates a regulatory taking upon Petitioner.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

(Petition for Writ of Mandate Under Public Resources Code § 21168.5 and

3 California Code of Civil Procedure § 1085 - Violation of CEQA)

4 131. Petitioner hereby incorporates by this reference the allegations of all previous

5 paragraphs of this Petition as though fully set forth herein.

132. In connection with its issuance of the Notice of Exemption claiming the common
7 sense exemption under CEQA Guidelines § 15061(b)(3), Respondent County abused its

8 discretion, did not proceed in the manner required by law, failed to make required findings, and
failed to act on the basis of substantial evidence. The County failed to conduct an adequate
10 environmental review process for the Project. Respondent's failures constitute violations of the
11| California Environmental Quality Act.
133. Significant or potentially-significant impacts arising from the Project were not sjeßuew sayaf Butler & Mitchell W NEIND 12

13 adequately identified, analyzed or mitigated. Respondent failed to appropriately analyze the
14 Project's potential environmental impacts.

15 134. Respondent failed to adequately respond to numerous public comments relating to
16 environmental concerns including traffic, greenhouse gases, air quality, and urban decay.
17 135. The so-called "common sense exemption" under CEQA, set forth in CEQA
18 Guidelines § 15061(b)(3), may only be employed where it is certain that there is no possibility the
19| project may cause significant environmental impacts.

20 136. Importantly, the decision to proceed under CEQA Guidelines § 15061(b)(3) must
21 be supported by substantial record evidence. The agency relying upon the exemption bears the
22 burden of proving its applicability. See Davidon Homes v. City of San Jose, 54 Cal. App. 4th 106
23 (1997).

24 137. The County is unable to meet its burden that it is a certainty that there is no
25 possibility of significant environmental impacts.

26 138. There is substantial evidence in the record, including a traffic study prepared by
27 Associated Transportation Engineers (Exhibit 20 to June 19, 2018 hearing agenda for the TRU
28 Ordinance matter) showing the possibility for significant environmental impacts. Furthermore,

23 62254518vl
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

there are numerous comment letters in the record where members of the public urge the County to
conduct a CEQA analysis.

139. Not only was this evidence not taken into account, it was actively ignored and
4 brushed aside with no regard for the environmental duties imposed upon the County under CEQA.
Indeed, the staff report for the June 12, 2018 hearing boldly proclaims (referring to the Exhibit 20
6 traffic study and related comments) that "these comments and data are not evidence that the
7 County's proposed TRU ordinances may have a significant traffic impact." (p. 9.) In fact, Exhibit

8 20 is exactly that: evidence that the County's proposed TRU ordinances may have a significant
9 traffic impact. That is also exactly what other comment letters have said. Just because the staff

10 report makes an inaccurate proclamation, that does not change the facts. Nor does it change the

m naypaw g 11 extremely stringent legal standard requiring no possibility of a significant environmental impact.

Mangels 12 140. Furthermore, an ordinance of this magnitude requires a CEQA. analysis, starting
13 with an Initial Study, and leading to either a Negative Declaration, Mitigated Negative Declaration p NENI 14 or an EIR (in order of magnitude).
15 141. Despite the substantial evidence that was provided showing a possibility of
16 significant environmental impacts, the County summarily dismissed and bypassed all CEQA
17 obligations (including the initial study), in violation of CEQA Guidelines § 15061(b)(3), and §
18 15004(b)(2), and Pub. Res. Code §§ 21067; 21080.1(a); 21083(a).

19 142. Petitioner as well as members of the general public will suffer irreparable harm if
20. the relief requested herein is not granted and the TRU Ordinance is allowed to go into effect in the

21 absence of a full and adequate CEQA analysis and absent compliance with all other applicable
22  provisions of CEQA.
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION 23

24 (Petition for Writ of Mandate Under California Code of

25 Civil Procedure § 1085 - Violation of Government Code §65855)

26 143. Petitioner hereby inçorporates by this reference the allegations of all previous
27 paragraphs of this Petition as though fully set forth herein.

28 144. Government Code §65855 provides: "After the hearing, the planning commission

24 62254518v1
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 shall render its decision in the form of a written recommendation to the legislative body. Such
2 Il recommendation shall include the reasons for the recommendation, the relationship of the
3 proposed ordinance or amendment to applicable general and specific plans, and shall be
4 transmitted to the legislative body in such and manner as may be specified by the legislative
5 body."

6 145. The recommendation given by the Planning Commission after the March 1, 2018
7 hearing did not contain many of the elements required by Government Code $65855, such as 1) an
8 actual recommendation regarding the TRU Ordinance itself, 2) reasons for the recommendation,
9 and 3) the relationship of the proposed ordinance or amendment to applicable general and specific

10 plans. Therefore, it was an absolute must that the matter go back to the Planning Commission for

11 mjjeupuw g apng TA a formal recommendation compliant with Government Code §65855.
2| Jeffer Mangels 12 146. At the May 1, 2018 Board of Supervisors meeting, the Board of Supervisors chose
13 to bypass the legally required formal recommendation from the Planning Commission, and
*CE WEND 14 proceed directly to a Board of Supervisors hearing to approve the matter, in direct violation® of

15 Government Code §65855.

16 147. Petitioner as well as members of the general public will suffer irreparable harm if
17 the relief requested herein is not granted and the TRU Ordinance is allowed to go into effect in the
18 absence of a full and adequate CEQA analysis and absent compliance with all other applicable
19 provisions of CEQA.

20

21 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

22 (Declaratory Relief Under Code of Civil Procedure 8 1060 -

23 Violation of Due Process, Equal Protection, Vested Property Rights, and

24 Regulatory Taking, under the California and United States Constitutions)

25 148. Petitioner hereby incorporates by this reference the allegations of all previous
26 paragraphs of this Petition as though fully set forth herein.

27 149. Petitioner has exhausted all applicable nonjudicial remedies.

28 150. An actual and substantial controversy exists between Petitioner and the County

62254518v1 25
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

over the lawfulness of the County's TRU Ordinance.
151. For the reasons previously stated, Petitioner asserts that the County's actions,.
3 including adopting the TRU Ordinance: 1) violate CEQA, 2) violate Government Code §65855, 3)

4 violate County residents' right to due process under the California and U.S. Constitutions, 4)

5 violate equal protection under the California and U.S. Constitutions, 5) violate vested property
6 rights under the California and U.S. Constitutions, and 6) constitute a regulatory taking under
7 Penn Central.

8 152. On information and belief, the County asserts that its actions, and the TRU

9 Ordinance, do not violate any of the above.

10 153. Therefore, declaratory relief is appropriate.

17 2. For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent
18 injunction restraining Respondent and their respective agents, servants and employees from taking
19 any action to implement the TRU Ordinance pending full compliance with CEQA and other state
