2 INTRODUCTION

3 1. On June 27, 2018, the City of Eastvale, by and through its City Council,
(collectively referred to herein as "Respondents"), adopted a series of resolutions and

5 ordinances that approved General Plan Amendments, Zone Changes, Major Development

6 Reviews, Conditional Use Permits, and Tentative Parcel Map No. 37492, for the Lewis Retail

7 Project, Project Nos. PLN17-20029 and PLN27-20015 (collectively "Project"), and certified
8 the Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the Project. The Project proposes a variety of non-
9 residential land uses over two sites totaling 24.38 acres. Respondents described the Project as
10 construction of a variety of commercial and civic uses, including two gas stations with markets

11 (and one car wash), a 3,500 square-foot fast food restaurant with a drive-through, a 2,000
12 square-foot coffee shop with drive-through, 4,000 and 6,000 square-foot restaurants, 4,000
13 square feet of retail, a 10,000 square-foot medical office, a 130-room hotel, a 40,000 square-
14 foot city hall, and a 25,000 square-foot public library. Project approvals include a General
15 Plan Amendment from Medium Density Residential to Commercial Retail, zone changes from
16 Watercourse, Watershed, and Conservation Areas (W-1) and Rural Residential (R-R) to
17 General Commercial (C-1/C-P), approval of a Tentative Parcel Map, Major Design Review,
18 Conditional Use Permits for the sale of alcohol and for drive-through operations, and
19 construction, grading, draining and encroachment permits.
20 2. Petitioners Louis Ontiveros and the Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters
21 (Petitioners) challenge the approval of the Project on the grounds that the Project does not
22 comply with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA--Pub. Resources Code §
23 21000 et seq.) because, inter alia, Respondents failed to provide an accurate and finite project
24 description, Respondents approved the Project despite the existence of a feasible alternative

25 that would reduce significant environmental impacts, the EIR's greenhouse gas analysis does
26 not utilize proper thresholds, and the EIR's cumulative impacts analysis regarding air quality
27 impacts and noise was insufficient to fulfill the informational purposes of CEQA.
28 Respondents' adoption of the EIR and approval of the Project constitutes an abuse of discretion

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
2

and must be reversed.

2 II

3 PARTIES

4 3. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 2 as if fully set
5 forth herein.

6 4. Louis Ontiveros is a taxpayer and resident of the City of Eastvale, California,
7 where the Project is located.

8 5. Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters is labor union representing 50,000
9 union carpenters in six states, including in Southern California, and has a strong interest in
10 addressing the environmental impacts of development projects, such as the Project. Members
11 of Petitioner Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters reside in the City of Eastvale and in
12 the County of Riverside, and include residents affected by the Project, whose interests will be
13 adversely affected by the violations of CEQA and approval of the Project. Southwest Regional
14 Council of Carpenters submitted three sets of comments on the Project that addressed the
15 inadequacies of Respondents' environmental review.
16 6. Respondent City of Eastvale, acting through Respondent City Council of the
17 City of Eastvale, is a municipal corporation in the County of Riverside. On June 27, 2018,
18 Respondents adopted a resolution in which they certified the EIR and Respondents also
19 approved a series of other resolutions and ordinances to approve the Project. On June 28,
20 2018, the Respondents filed a Notice of Determination with the County Clerk of the County of
21 Riverside.

22 7. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, or otherwise, of
23 Does through 15, are unknown to Petitioners who therefore sue said Respondents by such
24 fictitious names and will seek leave to amend this Petition for Writ of Mandamus when their

25 identities have been ascertained.

26 8. Petitioners are informed and believe that at all times herein alleged,
27 Respondents and each of them were the agents and employees of each of the remaining
28 Respondents and while doing the things herein alleged, were acting within the course and

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
3

scope of such agency and employment.

2 9. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that Real Party in
Interest Lewis Retail Partners (Real Party) is the listed recipient of the approvals at issue in this

4 action. Respondents' Notice of Determination lists the Project applicant as Lewis Retail
Partners. Pursuant to Public Resources Code § 21167.6.5, Petitioners are only required to

6 name as a Real Party in Interest the entity or entities listed as Project applicants in the

7 Respondents' Notice of Determination and effectuate service as to those parties. Petitioners
are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that Lewis Retail Partners is not, nor has it
9 ever been, registered with the California Secretary of State. On information and belief, Lewis
10 Retail Partners is not an entity that exists or is legally authorized to conduct business or

11 otherwise act in the State of California, including apply for or receive approvals from
12 Respondents, has not complied with the required formalities, and/or for other reasons did not

13 have the legal capacity to apply for or receive Project approvals when the applications were
14 submitted and approvals were made.
15 10. While the Notice of Determination identifies the Real Party as Lewis Retail
16 Partners, Respondents' other environmental review documents identify the Project applicant as
17 Lewis Development, LLC. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that
18 Lewis Development, LLC is not, nor has it ever have been, registered with the California

19 Secretary of State. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that Lewis
20 Development, LLC is not an entity legally authorized to conduct business or otherwise act in

21 the State of California, including apply for or receive approvals from Respondents, has not

22 complied with the required formalities, and/or for other reasons did not have the legal capacity
23 to apply for or receive Project approvals when the applications were submitted and approvals
24 were made. Further, pursuant to Public Resources Code § 21167.6.5, Lewis Development,

25 LLC was not listed in the Notice of Determination as a Project applicant.
26 11. Respondents' resolution approving the Project and certifying the EIR identifies
27 yet another entity, Lewis Land Developers, LLC, as the Project applicant. On information and

28 belief, Lewis Land Developers, LLC is a Limited Liability Company organized in the State of

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
4

Delaware and registered with the California Secretary of State. None of Respondents'
2 environmental review documents, including the Initial Study, Draft EIR, Final EIR or Notice
3 of Determination, identify Lewis Land Developers, LLC as the Project applicant. Pursuant to

4 Public Resources Code § 21167.6.5, Lewis Land Developers, LLC was not listed as a Project

5 applicant in the Notice of Determination.

6 12. To the extent any or all the above-named entities that are not listed as the
7 Project applicant in the Notice of Determination claim an ownership or some other legally
8 cognizable interest in the Project, or are doing business as Lewis Retail Partners, Petitioners
9 are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that the above-named entity or entities have
10 applied for and received Project approvals from Respondents, or otherwise qualify as Real

11 Parties in Interest for the Project.

12 13. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, or otherwise, of
13 Does 16 through 30, are unknown to Petitioners who therefore sue said Real Parties in Interest

14 by such fictitious names and will seek leave to amend this Petition for Writ of Mandamus

15 when their identities have been ascertained.

16 14. Petitioner is informed and believes that at all times herein alleged, Real Parties
17 in Interest and each of them were the agents and employees of each of the remaining Real
18 Parties in Interest and while doing the things herein alleged, were acting within the course and
19 scope of such agency and employment.

21 IUI

22 STANDING

23 15. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully
24 set forth herein.

25 16. Approval of the Project will adversely affect the interests of Petitioner Louis
26 Ontiveros. Petitioner Louis Ontiveros is an individual dedicated to protection of the
27 environment in the City of Eastvale and in the County of Riverside by participating in local
28 environmental and land use policy and decision making. Petitioner Louis Ontiveros is a

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
5

resident of the City of Eastvale and the County of Riverside and is affected by the Project, and
2 whose interests in preservation of the environmental integrity of the City of Eastvale and the
County of Riverside will be adversely affected by the lack of proper environmental review

4 under CEQA and approval of the Project. Petitioner Louis Ontiveros is also a member of

5 Petitioner Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters Petitioner is an "aggrieved person"

6 within the meaning of Public Resources Code § 21177.

7 17. Approval of the Project will adversely affect the interests of Petitioner
Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters and its members. Said organization is a labor union
9 that is dedicated to also preserving the environment for its members, including those in the
10 City of Eastvale and the County of Riverside. Approval of the Project and certification of the
11 EIR will adversely affect these interests of Petitioner Southwest Regional Council of

12 Carpenters and its members. Members or representatives of Petitioner Southwest Regional

13 Council of Carpenters, on behalf thereof, have submitted comments on and objections to the
14 lack of CEQA compliance during the administrative proceedings where the Project was
15 considered. Accordingly, Petitioner Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters is an
16 "aggrieved person" within the meaning of Public Resources Code § 21177. The claims

17 asserted and relief requested are broad-based, so that participation in the litigation by

18 individual members is not required.

19

20 IV

21 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

22 18. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 17 as if fully
23 set forth herein.

24 19. Petitioners have performed all conditions precedent to the filing of this Petition
25 by themselves or others, raising each and every issue known to them before Respondents, in
26 compliance with Public Resources Code § 21177, Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085 and

27 1094.5, and other applicable law.

28 20. Notice of the filing of this action as required by Public Resources Code §

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
6

21167.5 was mailed to Respondents on July 25, 2018. (Letter and Proof of Service are

2 attached hereto as Exhibit "A".)

V

JURISDICTION

21. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 20 as if fully

6 set forth herein.

7 22. Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to Public Resources Code § 21000
et seq., including Public Resources Code §§ 21167, 21168 and 21168.5, 14 Cal. Code Regs. §
9 15122 (hereinafter "CEQA Guidelines"), and Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085 and 1094.5, the
10 Constitution of the State of California, the Constitution of the United States, and all other
11 applicable laws.

12 VI

13 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

14 Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act
15 [Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.]

16 23. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 22 as if fully

17 set forth herein.

18 24. Respondents' approval of the EIR constitutes an abuse of discretion because,

19 inter alia, the EIR lacks an accurate and finite project description, Respondents approved the

20 Project despite the existence of a feasible alternative that would reduce significant

21 environmental impacts, the EIR's greenhouse gas analysis does not utilize proper thresholds,

22 the EIR's cumulative impacts analysis regarding air quality impacts and noise was insufficient

23 to fulfill the informational purposes of CEQA, and Respondents failed to recirculate the EIR

24 with the addition of new information the EIR was required by law to obtain. Furthermore,

25 Respondents failed to adequately respond to comments in the EIR. The responses were

26 incomplete, unresponsive, or deferred analysis. The evaluation and response to public

27 comments must contain a good faith, reasoned analysis. 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15088(b). Thus,

28 Respondents' failure to properly respond to comments on the EIR further constitutes a failure

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
7

to proceed in a manner required by law.

2 25. "An accurate, stable and finite project description is the sine qua non of an
informative and legally sufficient EIR." County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 710

4 Cal.App.3d 185. On one hand, Respondents assert the Project would develop nearly all of the
over 24 acres comprising sites and 2 of the Project, yet the EIR improperly limits its project

6 description to uses on only two (2) of 24 acres. The EIR lacked information on the lot

7 configurations and land use intensities of the remaining 22 acres. Furthermore, while
Respondents claimed a portion of the Project site would be devoted to civic uses, Respondents
9 rezoned the entirety of the Project to Commercial Retail. Thus, the EIR contained an
10| inaccurate project description and Respondents failed to proceed in a manner required by law.
11 26. In addition, Respondents failed to fully disclose or accurately describe one of

12 the central components of the Project approval. One of CEQA's core mandates requires that
13 no agency approval occur prior to certification of the EIR. Pub. Resources Code 21081;
14 CEQA Guidelines §15090(a). On information and belief, Respondents transferred the land

15 identified in the EIR as "Site 2" to Real Party prior to completing its environmental review. In
16 addition, in their EIR, Respondents admit they had already entered into an Exchange

17 Agreement with Real Party for Site 2 prior to certification of the EIR. Thus, Respondents

18 failed to accurately describe the Project.

19 27. CEQA requires that Respondents "not approve projects as proposed if there are

20 feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures available which would substantially lessen
21 the significant environmental effects of such projects ..." Pub. Resources Code § 21002. In

22 their response to comments, Respondents identified the Reduced Intensity Alternative as the

23 environmentally superior alternative, pursuant to CEQA Guidelines § 15126.6(e)(2).

24 Respondents did not make any determination as to whether this alternative was infeasible.

25 Thus, the Respondents failed to proceed in a manner required by law when they approved the

26 Project when there is a feasible alternative that would substantially lessen the environmental

27 impacts of the Project.

28 28. Respondents improperly relied on thresholds of significance they have not,

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
8

themselves, adopted. California law requiring the reduction of the State's contribution to

2 global greenhouse gas emissions requires Respondents to determine the contribution of the

3 Project on these emissions. State CEQA Guidelines allow an agency to determine the
4 significance of Project-level greenhouse gas impacts, for instance, by setting quantitative

5 emissions thresholds and by determining consistency with a Climate Action Plan, consisting of

6 regulations "adopted by the relevant public agency through a public a review process." CEQA
7 Guidelines § 15064.4(b). To be relied on as mitigation, this plan must actively "reduce or

8 mitigate the project's incremental contribution of greenhouse gas emissions." CEQA
9 Guidelines § 15064.4(b).

10 29. Respondents improperly used a quantitative significance threshold for

11 development projects and improperly relied on regional and state-level Climate Action Plans
12 that Respondents have not adopted. In their environmental review, Respondents evaluate the
13 consistency of the Project with, inter alia, the California Air Resources Board's AB 32
14 Scoping Plan (Scoping Plan) to conclude the Project-level impacts under this significance
15 threshold are less than significant prior to mitigation. The Scoping Plan is a statewide plan
16 designed to reduce certain categories of greenhouse gases consistent with the mandate of State
17 greenhouse gas laws. However, Center for Biological Diversity v. California Department of
18 Fish and Wildlife (2015) 620 Cal.4th 204, a recent landmark California Supreme Court

19 decision directly on point on this issue, noted that the Scoping Plan was not designed or
20  intended to be used at the Project-level. This case held that, to rely on the Scoping Plan, an
21 agency, such as Respondents, must provide analysis that adequately explains why application

22 of the Scoping Plan at the Project-level would be suitable under the circumstances.

23 Respondents provided no such analysis and, thus, Respondents' reliance on the Scoping Plan is
24| invalid. Respondents' reliance on this or any other plan not adopted by Respondents is
25 unlawful and erroneous. CEQA Guidelines § 15064.4(b). In addition, Respondents' use of the
26 Scoping Plan did not serve to "reduce or mitigate the project's incremental contribution of
27 greenhouse gas emissions," as required by law. CEQA Guidelines 15064.4(b). Accordingly,
28 Respondents' significance determination as measured against the Scoping Plan is without

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
9

1 merit.

2 30. Respondents disclosed that the Project would emit approximately 15,157.47

3 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2e) each year, well in excess of Respondents'

4 claimed emissions threshold of 3,000 MTCO2e. Respondents claimed they had limited ability
to mitigate the majority of Project emissions, as these emissions would occur offsite in the

6 form of mobile emissions. Respondents' proposed mitigation measures are a sham because the

7 measures do not require the Project applicant to actually reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.

8 Respondents failed to require other feasible mitigation measures, including, but not limited to,
9 installation of solar panels on business and gas station pump canopy roofs. Respondents failed

10 to proceed in a manner required by law when they failed to adopt all feasible mitigation

11 measures, as required by CEQA.

12 31. Respondents failed to provide an adequate cumulative air quality impacts
13 analysis. CEQA requires Respondents to consider direct, indirect and cumulative impacts.
14 Cumulative impacts include direct or indirect impacts caused by the Project that may be less

15 than significant at the Project-level but are significant when considered in conjunction with

16 other past, present and reasonably foreseeable future development. CEQA Guidelines 8 15355.

17 Respondents' analysis only considered emissions to be cumulatively significant if Respondents
18 determined these emissions would surpass direct and indirect Project-level significance
19 thresholds. Thus, Respondents failed to proceed in a manner required by law in failing to

20 consider impacts resulting from "individually minor but collectively significant projects," as

21 required by CEQA. CEQA Guidelines § 15355(b).

22 32. Respondents failed to adequately consider the cumulative noise impacts of the
23 Project. Respondents only evaluated two noise scenarios: existing and existing-plus-Project.
24 For the existing noise scenario, Respondents measured current noise levels in and surrounding
25 the Project sites. For the existing-plus-project scenario, Respondents modeled project noise

26 increases caused directly or indirectly by the Project and combined these noise outputs with the
27 "existing" noise scenario. However, Respondents entirely failed to consider the impacts of the

28 Project in conjunction with "past, present, and reasonably foreseeable probable future

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
10

development," despite clear evidence of probable future development that would impact future

2 noise levels. CEQA Guidelines § 15355(b) (emphasis added). Thus, Respondents failed to
proceed in a manner require by law because the noise analysis violates CEQA.

4 33. Notwithstanding all the above flaws in Respondents' environmental review, on
June 27, 2018, Respondents passed a resolution approving the Project and certifying the EIR,
which constitutes an abuse of discretion. Respondents must prepare an adequate EIR that
7 conforms with all of the procedural and substantive requirements set forth under CEQA.

8 Approval of the Project EIR, which lacked both procedural and substantive requirements under
CEQA constitutes a failure to proceed in a manner required by law.

10 VII

11 ATTORNEYS' FEES

12 34. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs through 33 as if fully
13 set forth herein.

14 35. In pursuing this action, Petitioners will confer a substantial benefit on the People
15 of the State of California and therefore are entitled to recover from Respondents and Real Parties
16 reasonable attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure § 1021.5, §
17 and other provisions of the law.

18

19 VIII

20 INJUNCTION

21 36. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 35 as if fully
22 set forth herein.

23 37. An actual controversy has arisen concerning Respondents' failure to comply
24 with CEQA (Pub. Resources Code § 21000 et seq.), as set forth above.

25 38. As result of the above-alleged violations of CEQA, Respondents have failed to
26 conduct adequate environmental review as required by law and, thus, have failed to proceed in
27 a manner required by law in approving the Project.
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
11

39. At all times mentioned herein, Respondents have been able to comply with

2 CEQA, prepare adequate environmental review, and comply with all relevant provisions of

3 law. Notwithstanding such ability, Respondents have failed and continue to fail to perform

4 their duty to comply with CEQA.

40. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that Real Parties

6 are threatening to proceed with development of the Project in the near future. Said
7 implementation of the Project will irreparably harm the environment and will result in
significant and unmitigated adverse environmental impacts.

41. Petitioners possess no speedy, adequate remedy at law, in that implementation
10 and development in connection with the Project will permanently and forever harm, injure,

11 degrade, and impact the environmental values of the City of Eastvale, the County of Riverside
12 and the State of California. Petitioners will suffer irreparable and permanent injuries if

13 Respondents' actions described herein are not set aside.

14 42. A stay and/or restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunction
15 should issue restraining Respondents and Real Party from proceeding with development of the

16 Project.

17 43. In order to preserve the status quo, a stay and/or restraining order and
18 preliminary and permanent injunction should issue staying Respondents' approval of the

19 Project and certification of the EIR.

20 PRAYER

21 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as follows:

22 1. For Alternative and Peremptory Writs of Mandate ordering Respondents to set

23 aside any and all Project approvals unless and until Respondents take all necessary steps to
24 bring their actions into compliance with CEQA, including, but not limited to, Respondents'
25 June 27, 2018 approval of Project Nos. PLN17-20029 and PLN27-20015 consisting of
26 approval of General Plan Amendments, Zone Changes, Major Development Reviews,
27 Conditional Use Permits, and Tentative Parcel Map No. 37492, certification of the EIR for the
28 Project.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
12

2. For an order staying Project applicants from engaging in any activity pursuant

2 to the Project, until the environmental review and the Project complies with California statutes

3 and regulations, including but not limited to the requirements of CEQA;

4 3. For reasonable attorneys' fees, pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure §

5 1021.5, and other provisions of the law;

6 4. For costs of suit; and

7 5. For such other and further relief as the Court may deem proper.

RE: Notice of Intent to Commence Litigation-Lewis Retail Project
Pursuant to the requirements of Public Resources Code Section 21167.5, this letter will serve as notice that Louis Ontiveros and Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters will commence litigation against the City of Eastvale and the City Council of the City of Eastvale
("City").

The litigation challenges the actions of the City to approve Project Nos. PLN17-20029 and PLN27-20015, including General Plan Amendments from Medium Density Residential to Commercial Retail, a zoning change from Watercourse, Watershed, and Conservation Areas (W-1) and Rural Residential (R-R) to General Commercial (C-1/C-P), approval of a Tentative Parcel Map, Major Design Review, Conditional Use Permits for the sale of alcohol and for
drive-through operations, construction, grading, draining and encroachment permits, and certification of an Environmental Impact Report. The City's Notice of Determination listed Lewis Retail Partners ("Real Party in Interest") and the City as Project applicants.
The litigation has been commenced because the actions listed in the preceding paragraph. do not comply with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code 21000 et seq.).

Very truly yours,
WITTWER PARKIN LLP W
