INTRODUCTION
27 l. Petitioners challenge the findings made by the County of Alameda, by and through its 28 Community Development Agency, Building Inspection Department, Planning Department,

FIRST AMENDED PETTTION FOR WRIS OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE DIBF 1

r

1 Public Works Agency, and Board of Supervisors ("the County") with respect to the structures
2 and alterations of land and water on properties commonly known as 3505 Morrison Canyon
3 Road, and 3163 Morrison Canyon Road, located in an unincorporated portion of Alameda
4 County near Fremont, California, which include the following:
5 a. The construction of a 12,000 square foot "barn";
6 b. The creation of a six million gallon lake and dam to alter the flow of the
7 watercourse in violation of Alameda County Municipal Code Section
8 13.12.090;

C. The creation of a white sand beach alongside the lake in violation of
10 Alameda County Municipal Code Section 13.12.090;
11 d. The construction of a 5,000 square foot "barn";
12 e. The construction of a 2,000 square foot greenhouse;
13 f. The construction of a large gazebo;
14 g. The construction of a mobile/manufactured home;
15 h. The excavation and grading of pastureland to create parking for up to 100

17 i The installation of a winery or brewery inside the 12,000 square foot
18 "barn" and the advertised production of beer on the properties;
19 • The construction of a plaza courtyard containing a water fall, fireplace,
20 retaining walls; and
21 k. The installation of a 500 feet gas line (collectively, "the George Ranch
22 Project").
23 2. Petitioners specifically challenge the County's decision(s) not to conduct a review
24 and prepare a report complying with the provisions set forth under the California Environmental
25 Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000, et seq. ("CEQA") with respect to the George
26 Ranch Project and/or any portions thereof, both permitted and non-permitted, including, but not
27 limited to, that are or were the subject(s) of a code and permit enforcement action in which the
28 County made the determination(s) that CEQA does not apply, despite overwhelming evidence to

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 2

1 the contrary. Petitioners also challenge the County's issuance of Building Permit Number
BLD2017-02969 on November 21, 2017, Building Permit Number BLD2018-01508, issued on

3 May 8, 2018, and all other permits the County issued for the George Ranch Project, without

4 complying with CEQA provisions.

5 3. Petitioners request this Court to vacate, set aside, rescind and void all of the

6 actions, resolutions, decisions and findings of the County that the George Ranch Project and/or

7 any portions thereof, are not subject to CEQA compliance, including rescinding any
8 authorizations to proceed with construction, and any findings that the George Ranch Project

9 and/or any portions thereof, are exempt from CEQA. Petitioners also request this Court order

10 the County to undertake a CEQA review of the George Ranch Project as a whole, including, but

11 not limited to, all the structures, alterations to land, and alterations to waterways listed in section

12 (1.) above.

13 4. The County has been investigating code and permit violations related to the

14 George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof since at least November 2017, and has stated that

15 decisions regarding CEQA review depends upon what their investigation uncovers. As of the

16 date of this filing, the County has not issued any Notice of Exemption or other public notice

17 related to the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof and the applicability of CEQA

18 review. Petitioners are informed and believe that any decisions or findings made by the County

19 as part of its ongoing investigation of the George Ranch Project, which includes the

20 applicability of CEQA compliance and any exemptions to the same, such decisions or findings
21 have been made in the last 180 days.

22 5. Petitioners are informed and believe the County will not issue a Notice of

23 Exemption or any type of public notice regarding their decisions related to the applicability of

24 CEQA compliance for the George Ranch Project as a part of their code and permit enforcement

25 action of both the permitted and non-permitted work.

26 6. The County issued Building Permit Number BLD2017-02969, for new

27 construction of a massive courtyard, complete with fireplace, waterfall, and retaining walls on
28 November 21, 2017, and Building Permit Number BLD2018-01508 on May 8, 2018 for a 500

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 3

1 feet long gas line, both for the George Ranch Project, without CEQA compliance. There are at

2 least 10 separate major alterations to land and structures that make up the George Ranch Project,
3 and all of them Petitioners are informed and believe are OT were the subjects of the County's

4 code and permit investigation and whether CEQA compliance is required. The County issued
5 permits for only one other structure or alteration for the George Ranch Project on or about
6 August 2014, and November 8, 2017, for a building known as the "Ag Barn" or the "mini palace
7 of Versailles", as dubbed by the County. Despite the issuance of the permits on the "mini palace
8 of Versailles", Petitioners are informed and believed this structure is or was one of the subjects

9 of the County's ongoing investigation and code enforcement action, and its determination of
10 whether CEQA review is or was required for the Ag Barn.
11 7. Petitioner seeks a Peremptory Writ of Mandate under California Code of Civil
12 Procedure § 1085, directing Respondents to vacate, rescind and set aside all George Ranch
13 Project approvals, including but not limited to all permits related to the "mini palace of
14 Versailles" and the plaza courtyard, to vacate, rescind and set aside all the County's
15 determinations and findings that CEQA compliance is not required for the George Ranch Project
16 and/or any portions thereof, to vacate, rescind and set aside all the County's determinations and
17 findings that the George Ranch Project and/or any portions thereof are categorically exempt from
18 CEQA compliance, and to order the County to require a CEQA review of the whole George
19 Ranch Project, including all portions thereof.

20 PARTIES

21 8. Petitioner MISSION PEAK CONSERVANCY is a neighborhood non-profit
22 membership organization dedicated to the preservation of the environment, protection and
23 enhancement of park access, and the construction of a network of bicycle and pedestrian trails in
24 southern Alameda County near Fremont, California, including the area in which the George
25 Project is located in Vargas Plateau near Fremont.

26 9. Petitioner KELLY ABREAU is an individual and is now, and at all times
27 mentioned in this Petition was, a resident of Fremont, in Alameda County, California.
28

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 4

1 10. Respondent County of Alameda is a government entity located in the State of
California.

11. Petitioners are persons beneficially interested in, and aggrieved by, the acts,

4 decisions, and omissions of Respondents as alleged in this petition. Petitioners have fundamental|

5 vested rights and interests which are adversely effected by the acts, decisions, and omissions of

6 respondent. Unmitigated environmental effects associated with the George Ranch Project will

7 adversely affect Petitioners as well as the public generally.

8 12. Respondents are charged with complying with applicable provisions of state law,

9 including CEQA. The Board of Supervisors is the duly constituted legislative body and highest

10 administrative body in the County and is charged with the duty of ensuring, among other things,

11 that all applicable, federal, state and county laws are fully and faithfully obeyed and

12 implemented. Respondents, through the Board of Supervisors, Community Development

13 Agency, Building Inspection Department, Fire Department, Department of Environmental

14 Health, and Public Works Agency, authorized construction of various portions of the George

15 Ranch Project without CEQA compliance. However, these permitted portions of the George

16 Ranch Project are currently the subject of Respondents' ongoing code and permit enforcement

17 action, which includes whether CEQA applies. Non-permitted structures and alterations
18 comprising the George Ranch Project are also the subject of Respondents' code and permit

19 enforcement actions, including whether CEQA applies. Petitioners are informed and believe and
20 thereon allege that Respondents have made their findings as to whether an exemption to CEQA
21 applies to the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof, but have not and will not notify the

22 public of said findings.

23 13. Real Parties in Interest Christopher George and Teresa George are individuals and

24 the owners of George Ranch, and the proponents of the George Ranch Project and any and all

25 portions thereof.

26 14. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Respondents sued herein

27 as DOES 1 through 20, inclusive, and Real Parties in Interest sued herein as DOES 20 through

28

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 5

1 40, inclusive and, therefore, sues these Respondents and Real Parties in Interest by such fictitious
2 names. Petitioners will seek leave to amend the Petition, if necessary, to allege the true names
3 and capacities when ascertained.

4 15. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that at all times material
5 hereto, each DOE Respondent named in this Petition was the agent and employee of each of the
6 other Respondents herein, and was at all times material thereto, acting within the course and

7 scope of the agencies and the employment and with the permission and consent of Respondents.
8 JURISDICTION, VENUE AND EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

9 16. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 1085 of the California
10 Code of Civil Procedure, and §§ 21168 and 21168.5 of the California Public Resources Code.
11 17. Venue is proper in Alameda County under §§ 394 and 305 of the California Code
12 of Civil Procedure as the County in which the real property in dispute is located and as a county
13 in which Respondents reside.

14 18. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of California Public Resources
15 Code section 21167.5 by sending a Notice of Commencement ("Notice") of this action to
16 Respondents prior to filing the original Petition for Writ of Mandate on or about May 18, 2018.
17 A true and correct copy of the Notice is attached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated herein by
18 this reference.

19 19. Respondents' findings that the George Ranch Project and/or any portions thereof
20 are not subject to CEQA compliance, and their actions in failing to conduct such CEQA review
21 of the George Ranch Project and/or any portions thereof, constitutes a prejudicial abuse of
2.2 discretion because, as alleged in this Petition, Respondents failed to proceed in the manner
23 required by law, failed to make mandatory findings, and/or made findings not supported by
24 substantial evidence. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, adequate remedy at law and, along with
25 members of the public, will suffer irreparable harm as a result of Respondents' violations of
26 CEQA as set forth herein.

27 20. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of California Public Resources
28

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 6

1 Code section 21167.7, and California Code of Civil Procedure section 388, by mailing a copy of

2 the original Petition for Writ of Mandate on or about May 18, 2018 to the State Attorney

3 General. A true and correct copy of the Service of the original Petition for Writ of Mandate and

4 copy of the Notice of Commencement of Action on the Attorney General, and a true and correct

5 Service of this Petition, is attached hereto as Exhibit B and C, respectively, and incorporated

6 herein by this reference.

7 21. California Code of Civil Procedure § 21177 regarding the exhaustion of remedies

8 requirement that must be satisfied in order to maintain this action does not apply to Petitioners in

9 accordance with subsection (e), which states "This section does not apply to any alleged grounds

10 for noncompliance with this division for which there was no public hearing or other opportunity

11 for members of the public to raise those objections orally or in writing prior to the approval of

12 the project, or if the public agency failed to give the notice required by law." (Code of Civil

13 Procedure § 21777(e).) Respondents have held no public hearings or issued any public notice
14 regarding CEQA review of the George Ranch Project and/or any portion thereof.

15 22. This pctition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section

16 21167 and Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations, section 15112. As a part of its code
17 and permit enforcement action regarding the George Ranch Project and/or any portions thereof

18 that has been ongoing since at least November 2017, Petitioners are informed and believe and

19 thereon alleges the County has made determinations, decisions and/or findings that the George

20 Ranch Project and/or portions thereof, both the unpermitted and permitted work, are exempt

21 from CEQA review, and that such determinations, decisions and/or findings have been made

22 within the past 180 days.

23 STANDING

24 23. Petitioners have standing as a party beneficially interested in the issuance of the
25 requested writ of mandate because the George Ranch Project, and/or portions thereof, as alleged

26 more specifically herein, will have significant adverse environmental impacts affecting the

27 individuals named herein as well as the general public. Petitioners have a beneficial interest in

28 Respondents' fulfillment of all their legal duties, as alleged in this pleading. The significant

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 7

1 adverse environmental impacts include, but are not limited to, increased traffic and safety issues,
2 habitat and waterway destruction, development of structures and parking on agricultural land,
3 and the exploitation of groundwater resources for gatherings, assemblies and the production of
4 beer or wine.

5 CEQA REQUIREMENTS

6 24. Respondents are subject to the requirements of CEQA when evaluating a project
7 that a may have a significant effect on the environment. The George Ranch Project is "project,'
8 and/or the portions thereof a part of a "project," as that term is defined by CEQA, such that it is
9 an "an activity which may cause either a direct physical change in the environment, or a
10 reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment", and which is "[a]n activity
11 that involves the issuance to a person of a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement
12 for use by one or more public agencies." (California Public Resources Code § 21065.)
13 25. CEQA requires governmental authorities, such as Respondents, to fully evaluate
14 potential environmental effects of projects, and to seek feasible means to reduce or avoid
15 significant environmental damage that otherwise could result from their actions. CEQA limits
16 agencies from approving projects with significant adverse impacts when feasible alternatives can
17 substantially lessen such impacts.
18 26. CEQA also requires governmental authorities, such as Respondents, to evaluate
19 the environmental impacts of The George Ranch Project of "the whole of an action". (California
20 Code of Regulations § 15378(A).) Under CEQA, Respondents must analyze the environmental
21 impacts of all reasonably foreseeable portions of the George Ranch Project and cannot separate a
22 larger project into smaller ones such that each individually has a lesser environmental impact
23 than the whole together, thus ignoring the impact of the George Ranch Project as a whole. a
24 27. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that Respondents, in
25 making their findings that CEQA review does not apply to the George Ranch Project and/or
26 portions thereof, have impermissibly and separately analyzed the 12,000 square foot "ag barn,"
27 the courtyard, the lake, the dam, the beach, the parking lot(s), the 5,000 square foot barn, and the
28 gazebo that make up the George Ranch Project, as separate individual projects.

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 8

1 28. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that Respondents have
2 determined that exemptions apply individually to each portion of the entire George Ranch
3 Project, versus determining whether CEQA applies to the George Ranch Project as a whole.
4 29. Had the County analyzed whether CEQA applies to the whole of the George
5 Ranch Project, substantial evidence would have led to the undeniable conclusion that replacing
6 barn with a "mini Palace of Versailles" complete with a plaza courtyard, expanding a cattle
7 stockpond into a lake with an artificial white-sand beach on the north side, damming the

8 watercourse (stream) to create the lake, grading the former rolling pastureland into parking lot(s)
9 with space for 100 cars, and erecting a barn with a brewery or a workshop and storage shed for
10 antique, steam-powered farm equipment, would create and has created significant and multiple
11 environmental impacts more than sufficient to trigger CEQA review and a report on the same.
12 30. The County has not undertaken legally mandated CEQA review to evaluate the
13 potential environmental effects of the George Ranch Project, has not prepared an environmental
14 impact report, or a negative declaration. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege
15 that the County has erroncously determined the George Ranch Project and/or the portions thereof
16 are exempt from CEQA review and reporting, despite the substantial evidence to the contrary.
17 31. Categorical exemptions to CEQA review, however, do not apply to the George
18 Ranch Project and/or any portion thereof.

19 32. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the County
20  determined the structures and alterations that make up the George Ranch Project are exempt
21 individually based on certain categorical exemptions, including, but not limited to:
22 California Code of Regulations § 15302 - "replacement or reconstruction of
23 existing structures and facilities where the new structure will be located on the

24 same site as the structure replaced and will have substantially the same purpose
25 and capacity as the structure replaced."

26 California Code of Regulations § 15304 - Class 4 "minor § public or private
27 alterations in the condition of land, water, and/or vegetation which do not involve
28

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR VRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 9

removal of healthy, mature, scenic trees except for forestry or agricultural
purposes."
California Code of Regulations § 15303 - Class 3 "construction and location of
limited numbers of new, small facilities or structures; installation of small new
equipment and facilities in small structures; and the conversion of existing small

6 structures from one use to another where only minor modifications are made in
the exterior of the structure."

8 33. The mini Versailles, although placed on the same space where the old barn was
located, does not have "substantially the same purpose and capacity as the structure replaced."
10 (California Code of Regulations § 15302.)

11 34. The lake, the dam, the parking lot and the beach are not "minor public or private
12 alterations in the condition of land, water, and/or vegetation which do not involve removal of
13 healthy, mature, scenic trees except for forestry or agricultural purposes." (California Code of
14 Regulations § 15304

15 35. The gazebo, the plaza courtyard and the 5,000 square foot barn are not "limited
16 numbers of new, small facilities or structures". (California Code of Regulations § 15303.)
17 36. Not only do the individual projects of the whole George Ranch Project meet the
18 requirements of any categorical exemptions, but when taken together with the whole of the

19 project as CEQA requires, the likelihood of a significant impact on the environment is patently
20 obvious.

21 37. Furthermore, there are exceptions to the categorical exemptions under CEQA.
22 California Code of Regulations § 15300.2(b) and (c), state:
23 (b) Cumulative Impact. All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the
24 cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is
25 significant.

26 (c) Significant Effect. A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where
27 there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the
28

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 10

1 environment due to unusual circumstances. (California Code of Regulations §
2 15300.2(b) and (c), emphasis added.)

3 38. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that if any exemptions do
4 apply to the George Ranch Project, which Petitioners deny, these exceptions to the exemptions
5 preclude the County from relying on the exemptions to foreclose CEQA review and reporting.
6 39. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that no exemptions under
7 CEQA apply to the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof, and challenge Respondents'
8 findings to the contrary.

9 THE GEORGE RANCH PROJECT

10 40. The George Ranch Project sits upon an approximate 700 acre spread of land in the
11 Sunol Hills east of Fremont, near the Vargus Plateau Regional Park owned by the East Bay
12 Regional Park District. This land was traditionally an agricultural area, and included a small and
13 seasonal cattle pond and stream, two barns, each over a hundred 100 years old, and a small
14 residential home. The road leading up to the George Ranch Project, Morrison Canyon Road, is a
15 narrow and hazardous road. Petitioners have complained to the County about the dangerous
16 condition of this road, especially when traffic volume is high to and from George Ranch.
17 41. Over the past 10-15 years, Mr. and Mrs. George, real parties in interest, have
18 made, are currently making, or intend to make substantial alterations to the land that may have or
19 a have had a significant effect on the environment, as well as the construction of many buildings,
20 a as a part of the George Ranch Project, including the following:
21 d. The construction of a 12,000 square foot "barn" which is an entertainment
22 facility that can accommodate large assemblies of people;
23 b. The creation of a six million gallon lake and dam to stop/alter the flow of
24 the watercourse in violation of Alameda County Municipal Code Section
25 13.12.090b;

26 C. The creation of a white-sand beach alongside the lake;
27 d. The construction of a 5,000 square foot barn;
28 e. The construction of a 2,000 square foot greenhouse;

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 11

1 f. The construction of a large gazebo;

2 g. The construction of a mobile/manufactured home;
3 h. The excavation and grading of a hill for parking for up to 100 cars;
4 i The installation of a winery or brewery inside the 5,000 square foot barn;
5 and the advertised production of beer on the properties
6 •- The construction of a plaza courtyard containing a water fall, fireplace,
7 and retaining walls.

8 k. The installation of a 500 feet gas line (collectively, "the George Ranch
Project").

10 42. Of all these sub-projects of the George Ranch Project, The County has issued
11 permits only for the construction of the 12,000 foot "barn,' also known as the "mini palace of
12 Versailles" per the County, for the plaza courtyard on the west side of it, and gas line installation.
13 Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege Mr. and Mrs. George did not seek or
14 obtain permits at the time of the construction and creation of the lake, the dam, the beach, the
15 parking lot, the brewery, the greenhouse, the gazebo or the other 5,000 square foot barn.
16 43. None of these sub-projects of the George Ranch Project have undergone any
17 CEQA review by the County, nor has the County held any public hearings or provided any
18 public notice as to any decision or findings it has made with regard to the applicability of CEQA
19 review of the George Ranch Project and/or any portions thereof.
20 44. The 12,000 square foot multi-story "barn" has a 2,000 square foot deck, radiant
21 in-floor heating, copper roofing, dormers and cupolas, 400 amp electrical service, a large septic
22 system, restrooms with disability access, an elevator, panic hardware on the exit doors suitable
23 for large gatherings of people, a sprinkler system, a groundwater treatment system for the
24 production of beer and wine, two walk-in refrigerators for the storage of kegs of beer and barrels
25 of wine, and class IV heavy-frame timber suitable for an entertainment facility that can
26 accommodate large groups of people. The barn this facility demolished and replaced was 100
27 years old, and appeared to a be a barn in the traditional sense of the word - typical size and typical
28 appearance of a barn.

AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 12 FIRST

1 45. The cattle stockpond was expanded into the six-million gallon lake, replete with
2 the white sand beach and a large gazebo with masonry/stone exterior. The watercourse leading

3 to the stockpond was cut off completely by the earthen embankment dam in violation of
4 Alameda County Municipal Code Section 13.12.090, which prohibits such work absent a permit

5 approved by the Director of Public Works for the County. This sections states:

6 "No person shall commit or cause to be committed any of the

7 following acts, unless a written permit has first been obtained from

8 the director of public works:

9 A. Discharge into or connect any pipe or channel to a watercourse;
10 B. Modify the natural flow of water in a watercourse;

11 C. Carry out development within a setback, as defined in Article V

12 of this chapter;

13 D. Deposit in, plant in, or remove any material from a watercourse

14 including its banks, except as required for necessary maintenance;

15 E. Construct, alter, enlarge, connect to, change, or remove any
16 structure in a watercourse; or

17 F. Place any loose or unconsolidated material along the side of or
18 a within a watercourse or so close to the side as to cause a diversion

19 of the flow, or to cause a probability of such material being carried

20 away by stormwaters passing through said watercourse."
21 (Alameda County Municipal Code Section 13.12.090)
22 Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege Mr. and Mrs. George violated
23 sections B, D, E, and F of the above ordinance, and Respondents violated CEQA in failing to
24 order CEQA compliance for the dam, lake and beach as a part of its code and permit
25 enforcement action.

26 46. A low hill in between the 12,000 square foot "barn" and the lake was graded and
27 excavated a to a flat surface that provides parking for up to 100 cars, and displaced approximately
28 1,200 cubic yards of earth.

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 13

1 47. The 5,000 square foot barn is not a barn in the traditional sense, but Petitioners
2 are informed and believe and thereon allege it is or has been used for brewing beer and restoring,
3 repairing, and storing antique steam-powered farm equipment and tractors. Mr. George
4 announced and advertised that beer had been produced at the George Ranch as of 2013-2015.
5 48. Petitioners are informed and believe that the courtyard plaza with its waterfall,
6 fireplace and 13-foot high retaining walls, is currently being built on the west side of the 12,000
7 square foot "mini palace of Versailles".

8 49. All in all, the George Ranch Project is transforming the formerly traditional ranch
9 and farm property into a large resort-style entertainment and event facility, all done without any
10 CEQA review, with almost no permits issued, with almost no planning review, with no zoning
11 review nor zoning adjustment by the East County Board of Zoning Adjustment, and with no
12 consideration of the traffic and safety issues it presents on Morrison Canyon Road.
13 50. Ironically, Mr. George shared or shares Petitioners' concerns with traffic and
14 safety on Morrison Canyon Road, and raised the same in two lawsuits he filed in 2008 and 2016
15 against the East Bay Regional Park District ("EBRPD") for CEQA violations with respect to a
16 park located next to (west of) the George Ranch and accessed via Morrison Canyon Road and
17 Vargas Rd.

18 51. In the first lawsuit, Mr. George described Morrison Canyon Road as "a steep,
19 rural residential one-lane road that ranges in width from 10 to 12 feet with no shoulder on what
20 the EBRPD calls Upper Morrison Canyon Road and which contains areas less than 9 feet in
21 width on what the EBRPD calls Lower Morrison Canyon Road. Vargas Road, a portion of which
22 iS owned and maintained by the City of Fremont and another portion of which is owned and
23 maintained by the County of Alameda, is a rural residential road, varying in width from
24 approximately 12 to 18 feet. Both roads have sharp horizontal curves and at least one sharp
25 vertical curve, with limited sight distance, and are below City of Fremont standards for
26 residential roads. It has been acknowledged by both EBRPD and the City of Fremont that these
27 roads are substandard." (First Amended Verified Complaint for Petition for Writ of Mandate,

1 Alameda County Superior Court Case No. HG08385193, Jack Balch and Christopher George V.

East Bay Regional Parks District (the "George Petition").)
52. The George Petition alleged in part:

4 "4 In addition, EBRPD also violated CEQA by:
(A) Failing to assess the environmental effects and related safety issues along
Vargas Road and Morrison Canyon Road generated from the Larger Project and
7 the phasing of the Larger Project, including Phase I and any limited opening of
8 the Park to the public in summer 2008.

9 (B) Failing to adequately assess the traffic and resulting adverse
10 environmental impacts and related safety issues along Vargas Road and Morrison
11 Canyon Road from the Larger Project and the phasing of the Larger Project,
12 including any limited opening of the Park to the public in summer 2008.
13 (C) Failing to adequately assess the parking needs generated by the Larger
14 Project and the phasing of the Larger Project, including any limited opening of the
15 Park to the public in summer 2008.
16 (D) Failing to undertake a traffic study of Vargas Road and Morrison Canyon
17 Road and instead relying merely on a traffic count on Vargas Road prior to
18 approving the Initial Study and Mitigated Negative Declaration and Land Use
19 Plan.

20 (E) Delegating to the City of Fremont implementation of unspecified
21 mitigation measures and failing entirely to assess the adverse impacts on County
22 owned portions of Vargas Road and how those will be mitigated.
23 (F) a Failing to adopt a monitoring plan to ensure implementation of mitigation
24 measures.

25 (G) Failing to respond to ongoing comments by resident neighbors concerning
26 the conditions of Vargas and Morrison Canyon Roads and mitigation necessary to
27 accommodate additional traffic."

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.- 15

1 53. The George Petition also complained about the parking lot that EBRPD intended
2 to construct at the park, one with 25 spaces and the other with 40 to 60 spaces.
54. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege a settlement was reached
in 2012 in which the EBRPD was required to make certain improvements to Morrison Canyon
Road and limit the parking lot to 25 spaces, but Mr. George and Mr. Balch filed a second lawsuit
6 in 2016, Balch v. East Bay Regional Park District, Case No. RG16814952, Alameda County of
Superior Court, alleging the road improvements were not performed in accordance with the
8 settlement agreement. An April 2017 settlement was reached in the 2016 lawsuit, which called
9 for more road improvements.

10 55. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege the improvements to
11 Morrison Canyon Road made as a result of these lawsuits and settlement agreements amounted
12 to $300,000-$400,000, hardly sufficient to address the multiple, serious substandard road
13 deficiencies and safety hazards alleged by the George Petition, and shared by Petitioners.
14 56. The George Ranch Project also has a parking lot that may accommodate up to 100
15 cars, four times the number of spaces that Mr. George insisted the EBRPD limit its lot.
16 57. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege George Ranch has hosted
17 events with over 40 cars in attendance on multiple occasions in recent years.

18 58. Despite the fact that Morrison Canyon Road and Vargas Roads remain
19 substandard as they were at the time of the filing of the George Petition, Mr. George and the
20 County have claimed and/or determined that CEQA review for the George Ranch Project and/or
21 portions thereof is not required when George Ranch is essentially a park, resort, event facility,
22 brewery and/or winery that is nearly comparable in area, and with many more peak hourly
23 visitors, if not more, than the adjacent East Bay Regional Park he shut down for some of the very
24 same concerns alleged in this Petition, not to mention that the George Ranch has a much larger
25 parking lot. (George Ranch has 700 acres and Vargus Plateau Regional Park has approximately
26 1200 acres.) In other words, the park is subject to vigorous CEQA review, but Mr. George's
27 own "park" is not.

28

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 16

THE CODE AND PERMIT ENFORCEMENT ACTION INTO THE GEORGE RANCH

2 PROJECT AND DETERMINATION OF THE APPLICATION OF CEQA
59. The County first issued permit number BLD2014-02739 for the foundation of the
4 12,000 square foot "barn" on or about February 6, 2015, and BLD2014-01654 for the
5 construction of the same on or about November 5. 2015. The County issued permit number
6 BLD2014-02024 on or about August 29, 2014 for retaining walls.
7 60. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege, based on a journalistic
8 investigation arising out of the 2014-2015 Report of the Alameda County Grand Jury, that the
9 permits for the "mini palace of Versailles" were fast-tracked in a highly irregular manner. Prior
10 to their issuance, a qualified professional on the staff of the County Planning Department wrote
11 the following assessment of the George Ranch Project in an email communication dated July 14,
12 2014: "Please do not issue any permits at this time. It's part of a much larger project that does
13 require CEQA and rezoning." Regardless, Respondents authorized the construction of the "mini
14 palace of Versailles," which is not intended for an agricultural purpose, to bypass building
15 review and failed to undertake the CEQA review that is required by law.
16 61. Albert Lopez, Planning Department Director for the County, states in a July 11,
17 2017 internal email, "it came in as cl "barn" structure that looked more like a mini palace of
18 Versailles. It was clearly being planned to be something else than a barn, so we sent a letter
19 saying if the use changes to something that is not ag related we would send code enforcement. It
20 was the best we could do at the time since the "barn" was legal land use-wise. The structure
21 itself was permitted by BID [Building Inspection Dept] and we signed off on it. We went back
22 and forth on the CEQA process and ultimately determined that since it was being built to replace
23 an existing barn over disturbed area, we exempted it from CEQA."
24 62. The County did in fact engage in a code enforcement action based on "use
25 changes to something not ag related" with respect to the "mini Versailles," which, as of
26 November 14, 2017, was ongoing.

27.

28

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 1.7

1 63. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon alleges that the County did not
2 a issue a Notice of Exemption or other public notice regarding its finding as stated in the
November 14, 2017 that the "mini-Versailles" was exempt from CEQA.
64. On or about November 8, 2017, the County issued permit BLD2017-03666 to
5 complete the construction of the 12,000 square foot barn, even though it admitted the "barn" was
6 no barn, but a "mini palace of Versailles" only four months earlier. On or about November 21,
7 2017, the County issued permit BLD2017-02969 for new construction of a large courtyard with a
8 waterfall, deck, retaining walls, storage area, gas fire place, and stairs. None of these
9 authorizations for work and/or construction underwent a CEQA review.
10 65. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege Mr. and Mrs. George did
11 not seek or obtain permits at the time of the construction and creation of the lake, the dam, the
12 beach, the parking lot, the brewery, the greenhouse, the gazebo or the 5,000 square foot "barn".
13 None of these projects underwent a CEQA review.

14 66. Since 2016, Petitioners have complained to the County regarding the George
15 Ranch Project and portions thereof, the use of George Ranch being something other than
16 agricultural, and their potential and actual significant negative effects on the environment,
17 including traffic and public safety, and habitat and waterway destruction. Petitioners have
18 demanded CEQA compliance, but to date, Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege
19 that the County has not engaged in CEQA compliance with respect to the George Ranch Project.
20 67. In light of the numerous complaints Petitioners have made regarding the George
21 Ranch Project and its use for purposes other than agricultural, the County engaged in a code and
22 permit enforcement action of the George Ranch Project and portions thereof, including "the
23 ongoing construction of the barn facility as well as discuss [sic] the overall use of the property
24 and any other permits that may need to have been secured by the property owner", according
25 to a November 14, 2017 email to Lawrence Edelson, a member of the Petitioner Mission Peak
26 Conservancy, Shawn Wilson and Chris Bazar, Director of the Community Development
27 Association.

28

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 18

1 68. Mr. Lopez stated in this email that "based on the complaints that we have

2 received, other structures on the property are being looked at as well, and the property owner

3 has met several times with the building department to discuss what he needs to do to bring

4 some of those structures into compliance. This is an ongoing code enforcement case and
5 naturally we are working towards resolution and getting all the buildings on the parcel
6 permitted and up to county code."
7 69. Thus, the 12,000 square foot "barn" had received its initial construction permit in

8 2015 and again on November 8, 2017. But, as of November 14, 2017, only six days later, the
County advises Petitioners that it is involved in a code and it permit enforcement action regarding
10 the structure it had already permitted, and those unpermitted structures as well, and to determine
11 whether CEQA review is required of the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof.
12 70. Mr. Lopez stated that "no discretionary permits have been required so far based
13 On the proposed use, and if through the code enforcement process this remuins true, then the
14 CEQA process will not be necessary. We have forwarded the concerns related to biological
15 habitat to the appropriate State officials, and are awaiting their response."
16 71. Again, even though the County allegedly determined CEQA was not applicable to
17 the 12,000 square foot "mini Versailles" as an existing structure exemption, the County, not later
18 than November 14, 2017, began anew the process to determine whether CEQA applies to said
19 structure as well as the other structures and changes.

20 72. According to this November 14, 2017 email, the County was holding off on any
21 final decisions regarding the applicability of CEQA review of the George Ranch Project and
22 portions thereof, including the "mini-Versailles," pending the results of the code enforcement
23 and permit action and responses from the appropriate State officials. That was approximately six
24 months ago, and Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that any findings made
25 by the County regarding the applicability of CEQA review to the George Ranch Project through
26 its code and permit enforcement action against the same have been made within the past 180
27 days.

28

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 19

1 73. At no time has the County issued a Notice of Exemption or any public notice
2 regarding any findings it has made regarding CEQA review of the George Ranch Project or any
3 portions thereof as a result of their investigation into the same that began no later than November
4 14, 2017. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege the County has determined not
5 to require or conduct a CEQA review of the George Ranch project and any portions thereof,
6 including but not limited to:

7 a, The ongoing construction of a 12,000 square foot "barn";
8 b. The creation of a six million gallon lake and dam to stop flow of the
9 stream;

10 C. The creation of a white sand beach alongside the lake;

11 d. The construction of a 5,000 square foot "barn";
12 e. The construction of a 2,000 square foot greenhouse;
13 f. The construction of a large gazebo;
14 g. The construction of a mobile/manufactured home;
15 h. The excavation and grading of pastureland for parking for up to 100 cars,
16 -. The installation of a brewery and/or a workshop and storage facility for
17 antique steam-powered agricultural equipment inside the 5,000 square foot
18 barn; and

19 • The construction of a plaza courtyard containing a water fall, fireplace,
20 and retaining walls.

21 k. The installation of a 500 feet gas line.

22 Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the County has determined
23 that the George Ranch Project, and/or portions of the same as listed above, are exempt from
24 CEQA review, or do not qualify a as a project under CEQA, within the past 180 days.
25 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

26 Failure to Direct CEQA Review of the George Ranch Project
27 The George Ranch Project is a "Project" and No Exemptions Apply
28

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 20

1 74. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in
2 paragraphs 1 through 73 as though fully stated herein.

3 75. Respondents are subject to the requirements of CEQA when evaluating a project
4 that may have a significant effect on the environment. The George Ranch Project is a "project,"
5 and/or the portions thereof a part of a "project," as that term is defined by CEQA, and has caused

6 and may cause direct physical changes in the environment, and carries the risk of reasonably
7 foreseeable indirect physical changes in the environment. The George Ranch Project and/or any
8 portions thereof involves or is legally required to involve the County's issuance of permits, the
9 enforcement of permits, and the enforcement of code violations.

10 76. Unless an exemption applies, or the activity does not meet the definition of a
11 project, CEQA requires governmental authorities, such as Respondents, to fully evaluate
12 potential environmental effects of projects like the George Ranch Project, and to seek feasible
13 means to reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that otherwise could result from
14 their actions. CEQA limits the County from approving projects with significant adverse impacts
15 when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen such impacts.
16 77. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege the County violated
17 CEQA because it failed to require and direct CEQA review and reporting for the George Ranch
18 Project and/or portions thereof, based on certain exemptions, and/or under the false premise and
19 unsupported assertion that the George Ranch Project does not meet the definition of a "project"
20 under CEQA.

21 78. Categorical exemptions to CEQA review, however, do not apply to the George
22 Ranch Project and/or any portion thereof, as fully described in this Petition, and the George
23 Ranch Project and/or portions thereof, meet the definition of a "project".
24 79. CEQA requires Respondents to evaluate the environmental impacts of the George
25 Ranch Project of "the whole of an action". (California Code of Regulations § 15378(A).)
26 Respondents must analyze the environmental impacts of all reasonably foreseeable portions of
27 the George Ranch Project and cannot separate this larger project into smaller ones such that each
28 || individually has a lesser environmental impact than the whole together, thus ignoring the impact

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 21

1 of the George Ranch Project as a whole. (Laurel Heights Improvement Association V. Regents

2 of the University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 396.)

80. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that Respondents, in

4 making their findings that CEQA review does not apply to the George Ranch Project and/or
5 portions thereof, violated CEQA and have impermissibly and separately analyzed the 12,000
6 square foot "ag barn," the courtyard, the lake, the dam, the beach, the parking lot(s), the 5,000
7 square foot barn, and the gazebo that make up the George Ranch Project, as separate individual
8 projects.

9 81. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that Respondents have
10 violated CEQA and determined that exemptions apply individually to each portion of the entire
11 George Ranch Project, versus determining whether CEQA applies to the George Ranch Project
12 as a whole, and/or determined that each individual portion of the George Ranch Project are not a
13 "project" subject to CEQA review, as opposed to the George Ranch Project as a whole.
14 82. Had the County analyzed whether CEQA applies to the whole of the George
15 Ranch Project as an official with Planning Dept proposed in July 2014, substantial evidence
16 would have led to the undeniable conclusion that replacing an old barn with a "mini Palace of
17 a Versailles" complete with a courtyard plaza, expanding a cattle stockpond into a lake with an
18 artificial white-sand beach on the north side, damming the watercourse (stream) to create the
19 lake, grading the former rolling pastureland into parking lot(s) with space for 100 cars, and
20 erecting a barn a with a brewery or a workshop and storage shed for antique, steam-powered farm
21 equipment, would create and has created significant and multiple environmental impacts more
22 than sufficient to meet the definition of a project to trigger CEQA a review and a report on the
23 same.

24 83. Furthermore, there are exceptions to the categorical exemptions under CEQA.
25 California Code of Regulations 15300.2(b) and (c), state:
26 (b) Cumulative Impact. All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the
27 cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is
28 significant.

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 22

(c) Significant Effect. A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where
there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the
environment due to unusual circumstances. (California Code of Regulations §
15300.2(b) and (c), emphasis added.)

5 84. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that if any exemptions do
apply to the George Ranch Project, which Petitioners deny, these exceptions to the exemptions
preclude the County from relying on the exemptions to foreclose CEQA review and reporting.
8 85. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the George Ranch
9 Project and/or portions of the same, both permitted and non-permitted work, are the subject of
10 the County's ongoing code and permit enforcement action (as of November 14, 2017), and the
11 County's determination as to whether CEQA applies.
12 86. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the County violated
13 CEQA and made unlawful findings that the George Ranch Project and/or any portions thereof
14 are not subject to CEQA compliance because of certain exemptions, or because it does not meet
15 the definition of a "project" under CEQA, as a part a of its code and permit enforcement action at
16 the George Ranch Project.

17 87. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that no exemptions under
18 CEQA apply to the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof, and challenge Respondents'
19 findings to the contrary as unlawful.

20 88. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the George Ranch
21 Project and all portions thereof, is a "project" under CEQA, and challenge Respondents' findings
22 to the contrary as unlawful.

23 89. Petitioners seek a writ of mandate revoking, rescinding, or voiding any and all
24 decisions, determinations and/or findings of the County that the George Ranch Project, and any
25 portions thereof, are exempt from CEQA compliance.
26 90. Petitioners seek a writ of mandate revoking, rescinding, or voiding any and all
27 decisions, determinations and/or findings of the County that the George Ranch Project, and any
28 portions thereof, do not meet the definition of a "project" under CEQA.

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 23

1 91. Petitioners seek a writ of mandate revoking, rescinding, or voiding any and all
2 authorizations for construction of the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof issued by the
3 County in reliance on the County's unlawful findings that CEQA compliance is not required.
4 92. Petitioners are entitled to recover attorneys' fees as provided in Code of Civil
5 Procedure section 1021.5 if they prevail in this action and the Court finds a significant benefit
6 has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons, and that the necessity and
7 burden of private enforcement is such as to make an award of fees appropriate.
8 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

9 Failure to Conduct CEQA Review of the George Ranch Project

10 93. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in
11 paragraphs 1 through 92 as though fully stated herein.
12 94. Respondents are subject to the requirements of CEQA when evaluating a project
13 that may have a significant effect on the environment. The George Ranch Project a is a "project,"
14 and/or the portions thereof a part of a "project," as that term is defined by CEQA, and has caused
15 and may cause dircot physical changes in the environment, and carries the risk of reasonably
16 foreseeable indirect physical changes in the environment. The George Ranch Project and/or any
17 portions thereof involves the County's issuance of permits, the enforcement of permits, and the
18 enforcement of code violations.

19 95. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that as a result of
20 Respondents' unlawful findings that the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof are
21 exempt from CEQA and/or are not a "project" under CEQA, Respondents further violated
22 CEQA by failing to conduct and/or prepare an Initial Study and a report on the same.
23 96. Petitioners seek a writ of mandate directing Respondents to comply with CEQA
24 with respect to the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof, and ordering Respondents to
25 prepare and complete an Initial Study under CEQA.
26 97. Petitioners are entitled to recover attorneys' fees as provided in Code of Civil
27 Procedure section 1021.5 if it prevails in this action and the Court finds a significant benefit has

2 burden of private enforcement is such as to make an award of fees appropriate.

3 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

4 Declaratory Relief

5 98. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in
paragraphs 1 through 97 as though fully stated herein.

7 99. A dispute and an actual controversy exists between Petitioners and Respondents

8 concerning their rights and duties in that Petitioners contend, and Respondents deny, the

9 following:

10 a. That the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof is a "project" under
11 CEQA;

12 b. That no exemptions apply to permit the County to forgo CEQA review of the
13 George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof, including but not limited to, conducting an Initial
14 Study and preparing a report of the same;

15 C. That CEQA review of the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof,
16 including but not limited to, conducting an Initial Study and preparing a report of the same is
17 required;

18 d. That Petitioners fundamental rights have been violated.

19 100. Petitioners desire a judicial determination of the respective rights and duties of
20 Petitioners and Respondents with respect to CEQA applicability to the George Ranch Project
21 and/or portions thereof

22 101. Such declarations are necessary and appropriate at this time in order that
23 Petitioners and Respondents may ascertain Respondents obligations under CEQA with respect to
24 the George Ranch Project and Petitioners rights.
25 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

26 Injunctive Relief

27 102. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in
28 paragraphs 1 through 101 as though fully stated herein.

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 25

1 103. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege Respondents have
2 unlawfully issued authorizations for construction of the George Ranch Project and/or portions
3 thereof in violation of CEQA, and have determined, despite an ongoing investigation into both
4 the permitted and unpermitted work on the George Ranch Project, that CEQA does not apply.
5 Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege the County unlawfully determined the

6 George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof are exempt from CEQA or do not qualify as a
7 "project".

8 104. Construction of the mini Versailles continues unabated, as does the plaza.

9 Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege the brewing activities continue, and large
10 events continue to be held on regular basis, using Morrison Canyon Road as access.
11 105. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege large events, such as
12 weddings, are set to be held at George Ranch this summer.
13 106. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege the damage done to the
14 environment already and in the future as a result of the George Ranch Project and/or portions
15 thereof and the illegal uses of the same, will continue unmitigated unless the County and Real
16 Parties in Interest are ordered to halt construction pending a judgment by this Court that CEQA
17 review and reporting is required, to suspend the issuance of any permits for the George Ranch
18 Project and any portion thereof pending judgment by this Court that CEQA review and
19 reporting is required, and to restrict event use of George Ranch.
20 107. Petitioners demanded and requested that Respondents and Real Parties in Interest
21 refrain from the conduct alleged herein and sought CEQA compliance, but Respondents failed
22 and refused the requests and, unless restrained by an order of this court, will continue
23 construction of the George Ranch Project, and continue to authorize construction and
24 impermissible uses of George Ranch.

25 108. By reason of the wrongful and unlawful acts, Petitioners have and will sustain

26 great and irreparable injury as described herein with respect to habitat and waterway alteration
27 and/or destruction and increased traffic and the safety issues presented due to the condition of
28

4 preliminary and permanent injunctions restraining Real Parties in Interest and Respondents, their

5 agents, employees, officers, and representatives from undertaking any construction, grading,

6 excavation, order or delivery of construction materials, installation or development, issuing any

2 California.

3 11. Petitioners are persons beneficially interested in, and aggrieved by, the acts,

4 decisions, and omissions of Respondents as alleged in this petition. Petitioners have fundamental
vested rights and interests which are adversely effected by the acts, decisions, and omissions of

6 respondent. Unmitigated environmental effects associated with the George Ranch Project will
adversely affect Petitioners as well as the public generally.
12. Respondents are charged with complying with applicable provisions of state law,
including CEQA. The Board of Supervisors is the duly constituted legislative body and highest
10 administrative body in the County and is charged with the duty of ensuring, among other things,
11 that all applicable, federal, state and county laws are fully and faithfully obeyed and
12 implemented. Respondents, through the Board of Supervisors, Community Development
13 Agency, Building Inspection Department, Fire Department, Department of Environmental
14 Health, and Public Works Agency, authorized construction of various portions of the George
15 Ranch Project without CEQA compliance. However, these permitted portions of the George
16 Ranch Project are currently the subject of Respondents' ongoing code and permit enforcement
17 action, which includes whether CEQA applies. Non-permitted structures and alterations

18 comprising the George Ranch Project are also the subject of Respondents' code and permit
19 enforcement actions, including whether CEQA applies. Petitioners are informed and believe and
20 thereon allege that Respondents have made their findings as to whether an exemption to CEQA
21 applies to the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof, but have not and will not notify the
22 public of said findings.

23 13. Real Parties in Interest Christopher George and Teresa George are individuals and
24 the owners of George Ranch, and the proponents of the George Ranch Project and any and all
25 portions thereof.

26 14. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Respondents sued herein
27 as DOES 1 through 20, inclusive, and Real Parties in Interest sued herein as DOES 20 through
28

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 5

1 40, inclusive and, therefore, sues these Respondents and Real Parties in Interest by such fictitious

2. names. Petitioners will seek leave to amend the Petition, if necessary, to allege the true names

3 and capacities when ascertained.

4 15. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that at all times material

5 hereto, each DOE Respondent named in this Petition was the agent and employee of each of the

6 other Respondents herein, and was at all times material thereto, acting within the course and

7 scope of the agencies and the employment and with the permission and consent of Respondents.

8 JURISDICTION. VENUE AND EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

9 16. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to § 1085 of the California

10 Code of Civil Procedure, and §§ 21168 and 21168.5 of the California Public Resources Code.

11 17. Venue is proper in Alameda County under §§ 394 and 305 of the California Code

12 of Civil Procedure as the County in which the real property in dispute is located and as a county

13 in which Respondents reside.

14 18. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of California Public Resources

15 Code section 21167.5 by sending a Notice of Commencement ("Notice") of this action to

16 Respondents prior to filing the original Petition for Writ of Mandate on or about May 18, 2018.

17 A true and correct copy of the Notice is attached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated herein by

18 this reference.

19 19. Respondents' findings that the George Ranch Project and/or any portions thereof

20 are not subject to CEQA compliance, and their actions in failing to conduct such CEQA review
21  of the George Ranch Project and/or any portions thereof, constitutes a prejudicial abuse of
22 discretion because, as alleged in this Petition, Respondents failed to proceed in the manner

23 required by law, failed to make mandatory findings, and/or made findings not supported by

24 substantial evidence. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, adequate remedy at law and, along with

25 members of the public, will suffer irreparable harm as a result of Respondents' violations of

26 CEQA as set forth herein.

27 20. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of California Public Resources

28

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 6

Code section 21167.7, and California Code of Civil Procedure section 388, by mailing a copy of
2 the original Petition for Writ of Mandate on or about May 18, 2018 to the State Attorney
General. A true and correct copy of the Service of the original Petition for Writ of Mandate and

4 Notice of Commencement of Action on the Attorney General, and a true and correct copy of the
5 Service of this Petition, is attached hereto as Exhibit B and C, respectively, and incorporated
6 herein by this reference.

21. California Code of Civil Procedure § 21177 regarding the exhaustion of remedies
8 requirement that must be satisfied in order to maintain this action does not apply to Petitioners in
accordance with subsection (e), which states "This section does not apply to any alleged grounds
10 for noncompliance with this division for which there was no public hearing or other opportunity
11 for members of the public to raise those objections orally or in writing prior to the approval of
12 the project, or if the public agency failed to give the notice required by law." (Code of Civil
13 Procedure § 21777(e).) Respondents have held no public hearings or issued any public notice
14 regarding CEQA review of the George Ranch Project and/or any portion thereof.
15 22. This petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section
16 21167 and Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations, section 15112. As: part of its code
17 and permit enforcement action regarding the George Ranch Project and/or any portions thereof
18 that has been ongoing since at least November 2017, Petitioners are informed and believe and
19 thereon alleges the County has made determinations, decisions and/or findings that the George
20 Ranch Project and/or portions thereof, both the unpermitted and permitted work, are exempt
21 from CEQA review, and that such determinations, decisions and/or findings have been made
22 within the past 180 days.
23 STANDING

24 23. Petitioners have standing a as a party beneficially interested in the issuance of the
25 requested writ of mandate because the George Ranch Project, and/or portions thereof, as alleged
26 more specifically herein, will have significant adverse environmental impacts affecting the
27 individuals named herein as well as the general public. Petitioners have a beneficial interest in
28 Respondents' fulfillment of all their legal duties, as alleged in this pleading. The significant

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 7

1 adverse environmental impacts include, but are not limited to, increased traffic and safety issues,
2 habitat and waterway destruction, development of structures and parking on agricultural land,

3 and the exploitation of groundwater resources for gatherings, assemblies and the production of

4 beer or wine.

5 CEQA REQUIREMENTS

6 24. Respondents are subject to the requirements of CEQA when evaluating a project

7 that may have a significant effect on the environment. The George Ranch Project is a "project,'
8 and/or the portions thereof a part of a "project," as that term is defined by CEQA, such that it is

9 an "an activity which may cause either a direct physical change in the environment, or a
10 reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment", and which is "[a]n activity
11 that involves the issuance to a person of lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement

12 for use by one or more public agencies." (California Public Resources Code § 21065.)
13 25. CEQA requires governmental authorities, such as Respondents, to fully evaluate
14 potential environmental effects of projects, and to seek feasible means to reduce or avoid
15 significant environmental damage that otherwise could result from their actions. CEQA limits
16 agencies from approving projects with significant adverse impacts when feasible alternatives can
17 substantially lessen such impacts.

18 26. CEQA also requires governmental authorities, such as Respondents, to evaluate
19 the environmental impacts of The George Ranch Project of "the whole of an action". (California!
20 Code of Regulations § 15378(A).) Under CEQA, Respondents must analyze the environmental
21 impacts of all reasonably foreseeable portions of the George Ranch Project and cannot separate a
22 larger project into smaller ones such that each individually has a lesser environmental impact
23 than the whole together, thus ignoring the impact of the George Ranch Project as a whole.
24 27. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that Respondents, in
25 making their findings that CEQA review does not apply to the George Ranch Project and/or
26 portions thereof, have impermissibly and separately analyzed the 12,000 square foot "ag barn,"
27 the courtyard, the lake, the dam, the beach, the parking lot(s), the 5,000 square foot barn, and the
28 gazebo that make up the George Ranch Project, as separate individual projects.

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 8

1 28. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that Respondents have
2 determined that exemptions apply individually to each portion of the entire George Ranch
3 Project, versus determining whether CEQA applies to the George Ranch Project as a whole.
4 29. Had the County analyzed whether CEQA applies to the whole of the George
5 Ranch Project, substantial evidence would have led to the undeniable conclusion that replacing a

6 barn with a "mini Palace of Versailles" complete with a plaza courtyard, expanding a cattle a
7 a stockpond into a lake with an artificial white-sand beach on the north side, damming the
8 watercourse (stream) to create the lake, grading the former rolling pastureland into parking lot(s)|
9 with space for 100 cars, and erecting barn with a brewery or a workshop and storage shed for
10 antique, steam-powered farm equipment, would create and has created significant and multiple
11 environmental impacts more than sufficient to trigger CEQA review and a report on the same.
12 30. The County has not undertaken a legally mandated CEQA review to evaluate the
13 potential environmental effects of the George Ranch Project, has not prepared an environmental
14 impact report, or a negative declaration. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege
15 that the County has erroneously determined the George Ranch Project and/or the portions thereof
16 are exempt from CEQA review and reporting, despite the substantial evidence to the contrary.
17 31. Categorical exemptions to CEQA review, however, do not apply to the George
18 Ranch Project and/or any portion thereof.

19 32. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the County
20 determined the structures and alterations that make up the George Ranch Project are exempt
21 individually based on certain categorical exemptions, including, but not limited to:
22 California Code of Regulations § 15302 - "replacement or reconstruction of
23 existing structures and facilities where the new structure will be located on the

24 same site as the structure replaced and will have substantially the same purpose
25 and capacity as the structure replaced."

26 California Code of Regulations § 15304 - Class 4 "minor public or private
27 alterations in the condition of land, water, and/or vegetation which do not involve
28

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 9

removal of healthy, mature, scenic trees except for forestry or agricultural
purposes."
California Code of Regulations § 15303 Class 3 "construction and location of

4 limited numbers of new, small facilities or structures; installation of small new

5 equipment and facilities in small structures; and the conversion of existing small

6 structures from one use to another where only minor modifications are made in
the exterior of the structure."

8 33. The mini Versailles, although placed on the same space where the old barn was
9 located, does not have "substantially the same purpose and capacity as the structure replaced."
10 (California Code of Regulations § 15302.)

11 34. The lake, the dam, the parking lot and the beach are not "minor public or private
12 alterations in the condition of land, water, and/or vegetation which do not involve removal of
13 healthy, mature, scenic trees except for forestry or agricultural purposes." (California Code of
14 Regulations § 15304

15 35. The gazebo, the plaza courtyard and the 5,000 square foot barn are not "limited
16 numbers of new, small facilities or structures". (California Code of Regulations § 15303.)
17 36. Not only do the individual projects of the whole George Ranch Project meet the
18 requirements of any categorical exemptions, but when taken together with the whole of the
19 project as CEQA requires, the likelihood of a significant impact on the environment is patently
20 obvious.

21 37. Furthermore, there are exceptions to the categorical exemptions under CEQA.
22 California Code of Regulations § 15300.2(b) and (c), state:
23 (b) Cumulative Impact. All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the
24 cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is
25 significant.

26 (c) Significant Effect. A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where
27 there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the
28

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 10

1 environment due to unusual circumstances. (California Code of Regulations §

2 15300.2(b) and (c), emphasis added.)

3 38. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that if any exemptions do

4 apply to the George Ranch Project, which Petitioners deny, these exceptions to the exemptions

5 preclude the County from relying on the exemptions to foreclose CEQA review and reporting.

6 39. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that no exemptions under
7 CEQA apply to the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof, and challenge Respondents'

8 findings to the contrary.

9 THE GEORGE RANCH PROJECT

10 40. The George Ranch Project sits upon an approximate 700 acre spread of land in the
11 Sunol Hills east of Fremont, near the Vargus Plateau Regional Park owned by the East Bay
12 Regional Park District. This land was traditionally an agricultural area, and included a small and
13 seasonal cattle pond and stream, two barns, each over a hundred 100 years old, and a small
14 residential home. The road leading up to the George Ranch Project, Morrison Canyon Road, is a
15 narrow and hazardous road. Petitioners have complained to the County about the dangerous
16 condition of this road, especially when traffic volume is high to and from George Ranch.
17 41. Over the past 10-15 years, Mr. and Mrs. George, real parties in interest, have
18 made, are currently making, or intend to make substantial alterations to the land that may have or
19 have had a significant effect on the environment, as well as the construction of many buildings,
20 as a part of the George Ranch Project, including the following:
21 a. The construction of a 12,000 square foot "barn" which is an entertainment
22 facility that can accommodate large assemblies of people;
23 b. The creation of a six million gallon lake and dam to stop/alter the flow of
24 the watercourse in violation of Alameda County Municipal Code Section
25 13.12.090b;

26 C. The creation of a white-sand beach alongside the lake;
27 d. The construction of a 5,000 square foot barn;
28 C. The construction of a 2,000 square foot greenhouse;

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 11

1 f. The construction of a large gazebo;

2 g. The construction of a mobile/manufactured home;

3 h. The excavation and grading of a hill for parking for up to 100 cars;
4 i. The installation of a winery or brewery inside the 5,000 square foot barn;
5 and the advertised production of beer on the properties

6 •- The construction of a plaza courtyard containing a water fall, fireplace,
7 and retaining walls.

8 k. The installation of a 500 feet gas line (collectively, "the George Ranch

9 Project").

10 42. Of all these sub-projects of the George Ranch Project, The County has issued
11 permits only for the construction of the 12,000 foot "barn," also known as the "mini palace of
12 Versailles" per the County, for the plaza courtyard on the west side of it, and gas line installation.
13 Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege Mr. and Mrs. George did not seek or
14 obtain permits at the time of the construction and creation of the lake, the dam, the beach, the
15 parking lot, the brewery, the greenhouse, the gazebo or the other 5,000 square foot barn.
16 43. None of these sub-projects of the George Ranch Project have undergone any
17 CEQA review by the County, nor has the County held any public hearings or provided any
18 public notice as to any decision or findings it has made with regard to the applicability of CEQA
19 review of the George Ranch Project and/or any portions thereof.
20 44. The 12,000 square foot multi-story "barn" has a 2,000 square foot deck, radiant
21 in-floor heating, copper roofing, dormers and cupolas, 400 amp electrical service, a large septic
22 system, restrooms with disability access, an elevator, panic hardware on the exit doors suitable

23 for large gatherings of people, a sprinkler system, a groundwater treatment system for the
24 production of beer and wine, two walk-in refrigerators for the storage of kegs of beer and barrels
25 of wine, and class IV heavy-frame timber suitable for an entertainment facility that can
26 accommodate large groups of people. The barn this facility demolished and replaced was 100
27 years old, and appeared to be a barn in the traditional sense of the word - typical size and typical
28 appearance of a barn.

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 12

1 45. The cattle stockpond was expanded into the six-million gallon lake, replete with

2 the white sand beach and a large gazebo with a masonry/stone exterior. The watercourse leading

3 to the stockpond was cut off completely by the earthen embankment dam in violation of

4 Alameda County Municipal Code Section 13.12.090, which prohibits such work absent a permit

5 approved by the Director of Public Works for the County. This sections states:

6 "No person shall commit or cause to be committed any of the

7 following acts, unless a written permit has first been obtained from

8 the director of public works:

9 A. Discharge into or connect any pipe or channel to a watercourse;
10 B. Modify the natural flow of water in a watercourse;

11 C. Carry out development within a setback, as defined in Article V
12 of this chapter;

13 D. Deposit in, plant in, or remove any material from a watercourse
14 including its banks, except as required for necessary maintenance;

15 E. Construct, alter, enlarge, connect to, change, or remove any

16 structure in a watercourse; or

17 F. Place any loose or unconsolidated material along the side of or

18 within a watercourse or so close to the side as to cause a diversion

19 of the flow, or to cause a probability of such material being carried
20 away by stormwaters passing through said watercourse."

21 (Alameda County Municipal Code Section 13.12.090)

22 Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege Mr. and Mrs. George violated

23 F sections B, D, E, and F of the above ordinance, and Respondents violated CEQA in failing to

24 order CEQA compliance for the dam, lake and beach as a part of its code and permit

25 enforcement action.

26 46. A low hill in between the 12,000 square foot "barn" and the lake was graded and

27 excavated to a flat surface that provides parking for up to 100 cars, and displaced approximately

28 1,200 cubic yards of earth.

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 13

1 47. The 5,000 square foot barn is not a barn in the traditional sense, but Petitioners
2 are informed and believe and thereon allege it is or has been used for brewing beer and restoring,

3 repairing, and storing antique steam-powered farm equipment and tractors. Mr. George

4 announced and advertised that beer had been produced at the George Ranch as of 2013-2015.
5 48. Petitioners are informed and believe that the courtyard plaza with its waterfall,

6 fireplace and 13-foot high retaining walls, is currently being built on the west side of the 12,000

7 square foot "mini palace of Versailles".

8 49. All in all, the George Ranch Project is transforming the formerly traditional ranch

9 and farm property into a large resort-style entertainment and event facility, all done without any
10 CEQA review, with almost no permits issued, with almost no planning review, with no zoning
11 review nor zoning adjustment by the East County Board of Zoning Adjustment, and with no
12 consideration of the traffic and safety issues it presents on Morrison Canyon Road.
13 50. Ironically, Mr. George shared or shares Petitioners' concerns with traffic and

14 safety on Morrison Canyon Road, and raised the same in two lawsuits he filed in 2008 and 2016
15 against the East Bay Regional Park District ("EBRPD") for CEQA violations with respect to a
16 park located next to (west of) the George Ranch and accessed via Morrison Canyon Road and
17 Vargas Rd.

18 51. In the first lawsuit, Mr. George described Morrison Canyon Road as "a steep,

19 rural residential one-lane road that ranges in width from 10 to 12 feet with no shoulder on what

20 the EBRPD calls Upper Morrison Canyon Road and which contains areas less than 9 feet in
21 width on what the EBRPD calls Lower Morrison Canyon Road. Vargas Road, a portion of which
22 is owned and maintained by the City of Fremont and another portion of which is owned and
23 maintained by the County of Alameda, is a rural residential road, varying in width from
24 approximately 12 to 18 feet. Both roads have sharp horizontal curves and at least one sharp
25 vertical curve, with limited sight distance, and are below City of Fremont standards for
26 residential roads. It has been acknowledged by both EBRPD and the City of Fremont that these
27 roads are substandard." (First Amended Verified Complaint for Petition for Writ of Mandate,

1 Alameda County Superior Court Case No. HG08385193, Jack Balch and Christopher George V.
2 East Bay Regional Parks District (the "George Petition").)

3 52. The George Petition alleged in part:

4 "4. In addition, EBRPD also violated CEQA by:

5 (A) Failing to assess the environmental effects and related safety issues along
Vargas Road and Morrison Canyon Road generated from the Larger Project and
7 the phasing of the Larger Project, including Phase I and I any limited opening of

8 the Park to the public in summer 2008.

9 (B) Failing to adequately assess the traffic and resulting adverse
10 environmental impacts and related safety issues along Vargas Road and Morrison
11 Canyon Road from the Larger Project and the phasing of the Larger Project,
12 including any limited opening of the Park to the public in summer 2008.
13 (C) Failing to adequately assess the parking needs generated by the Larger
14 Project and the phasing of the Larger Project, including any limited opening of the
15 Park to the public in summer 2008.

16 (D) Failing to undertake a traffic study of Vargas Road and Morrison Canyon
17 Road and instead relying merely on a traffic count on Vargas Road prior to
18 approving the Initial Study and Mitigated Negative Declaration and Land Use
19 Plan.

20 (E) Delegating to the City of Fremont implementation of unspecified
21 mitigation measures and failing entirely to assess the adverse impacts on County
22 owned portions of Vargas Road and how those will be mitigated.
23 (F) a Failing to adopt a monitoring plan to ensure implementation of mitigation
24 measures.

25 (G) Failing to respond to ongoing comments by resident neighbors concerning
26 the conditions of Vargas and Morrison Canyon Roads and mitigation necessary to
27 accommodate additional traffic."

28

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.- 15

1 53. The George Petition also complained about the parking lot that EBRPD intended

2 to construct at the park, one with 25 spaces and the other with 40 to 60 spaces.

3 54. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege a settlement was reached

4 in 2012 in which the EBRPD was required to make certain improvements to Morrison Canyon

5 Road and limit the parking lot to 25 spaces, but Mr. George and Mr. Balch filed a second lawsuit a

6 in 2016, Balch v. East Bay Regional Park District, Case No. RG16814952, Alameda County of

7 Superior Court, alleging the road improvements were not performed in accordance with the

8 settlement agreement. An April 2017 settlement was reached in the 2016 lawsuit, which called

9 for more road improvements.

10 55. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege the improvements to
11 Morrison Canyon Road made as result of these lawsuits and settlement agreements amounted

12 to $300,000-$400,000, hardly sufficient to address the multiple, serious substandard road
13 deficiencies and safety hazards alleged by the George Petition, and shared by Petitioners.

14 56. The George Ranch Project also has a parking lot that may accommodate up to 100
15 cars, four times the number of spaces that Mr. George insisted the EBRPD limit its lot.
16 57. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege George Ranch has hosted
17 events with over 40 cars in attendance on multiple occasions in recent years.

18 58. Despite the fact that Morrison Canyon Road and Vargas Roads remain
19 substandard as they were at the time of the filing of the George Petition, Mr. George and the
20 County have claimed and/or determined that CEQA review for the George Ranch Project and/or
21 portions thereof is not required when George Ranch is essentially a park, resort, event facility,
22 brewery and/or winery that is nearly comparable in area, and with many more peak hourly
23 visitors, if not more, than the adjacent East Bay Regional Park he shut down for some of the very
24 same concerns alleged in this Petition, not to mention that the George Ranch has a much larger
25 parking lot. (George Ranch has 700 acres and Vargus Plateau Regional Park has approximately
26 1200 acres.) In other words, the park is subject to vigorous CEQA review, but Mr. George's
27 own "park" is not.

28

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 16

THE CODE AND PERMIT ENFORCEMENT ACTION INTO THE GEORGE RANCH

2 PROJECT AND DETERMINATION OF THE APPLICATION OF CEQA

3 59. The County first issued permit number BLD2014-02739 for the foundation of the

4 12,000 square foot "barn" on or about February 6, 2015, and BLD2014-01654 for the
5 construction of the same on or about November 5, 2015. The County issued permit number
6 BLD2014-02024 on or about August 29, 2014 for retaining walls.

7 60. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege, based on a journalistic

8 investigation arising out of the 2014-2015 Report of the Alameda County Grand Jury, that the

9 permits for the "mini palace of Versailles" were fast-tracked in a highly irregular manner. Prior
10 to their issuance, a qualified professional on the staff of the County Planning Department wrote
11 the following assessment of the George Ranch Project in an email communication dated July 14,
12 2014: "Please do not issue any permits at this time. It's part of a much larger project that does
13 require CEQA and rezoning." Regardless, Respondents authorized the construction of the "mini
14 palace of Versailles," which is not intended for an agricultural purpose, to bypass building
15 review and failed to undertake the CEQA review that is required by law.
16 61. Albert Lopez, Planning Department Director for the County, states in a July 11,
17 2017 internal email, "it came in as Cl. "barn" structure that looked more like a mini palace of
18 Versailles. It was clearly being planned to be something else than a barn, SO we sent a letter
19 saying if the use changes to something that is not ag related we would send code enforcement. It
20 was the best we could do at the time since the "barn" was legal land use-wise. The structure
21 itself was permitted by BID [Building Inspection Dept] and we signed off on it. We went back
22 and forth on the CEQA process and ultimately determined that since it was being built to replace
23 an existing barn over disturbed area, we exempted it from CEQA."
24 62. The County did in fact engage in a code enforcement action based on "use
25 changes to something not ag related" with respect to the "mini Versailles," which, as of
26 November 14, 2017, was ongoing.

27

28

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 17

1 63. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon alleges that the County did not
2 issue a Notice of Exemption or other public notice regarding its finding as stated in the
3 November 14, 2017 that the "mini-Versailles" was exempt from CEQA.

4 64. On or about November 8, 2017, the County issued permit BLD2017-03666 to
5 complete the construction of the 12,000 square foot barn, even though it admitted the "barn" was
6 no barn, but a "mini palace of Versailles" only four months earlier. On or about November 21,
7 2017, the County issued permit BLD2017-02969 for new construction of a large courtyard with
8 waterfall, deck, retaining walls, storage area, gas fire place, and stairs. None of these

9 authorizations for work and/or construction underwent a CEQA review.

10 65. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege Mr. and Mrs. George did
11 not seek or obtain permits at the time of the construction and creation of the lake, the dam, the
12 beach, the parking lot, the brewery, the greenhouse, the gazebo or the 5,000 square foot "barn".
13 None of these projects underwent a CEQA review.

14 66. Since 2016, Petitioners have complained to the County regarding the George
15 Ranch Project and portions thereof, the use of Goorge Ranch being something other than
16 agricultural, and their potential and actual significant negative effects on the environment,
17 including traffic and public safety, and habitat and waterway destruction. Petitioners have
18 demanded CEQA compliance, but to date, Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege
19 that the County has not engaged in CEQA compliance with respect to the George Ranch Project.
20 67. In light of the numerous complaints Petitioners have made regarding the George
21 Ranch Project and its use for purposes other than agricultural, the County engaged in a code and
22 permit enforcement action of the George Ranch Project and portions thereof, including "the
23 ongoing construction of the barn facility as well as discuss [sic] the overall use of the property
24 and any other permits that may need to have been secured by the property owner", according
25 to a November 14, 2017 email to Lawrence Edelson, a member of the Petitioner Mission Peak
26 Conservancy, Shawn Wilson and Chris Bazar, Director of the Community Development
27 Association.

28

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 18

1 68. Mr. Lopez stated in this email that "based on the complaints that we have
2 received, other structures on the property are being looked at as well, and the property owner
3 has met several times with the building department to discuss what he needs to do to bring

4 some of those structures into compliance. This is an ongoing code enforcement case and
5 naturally we are working towards resolution and getting all the buildings on the parcel
6 permitted and up to county code."

7 69. Thus, the 12,000 square foot "barn" had received its initial construction permit in
8 2015 and again on November 8, 2017. But, as of November 14, 2017, only six days later, the

9 County advises Petitioners that it is involved in a code and permit enforcement action regarding
10 the structure it had already permitted, and those unpermitted structures as well, and to determine

11 whether CEQA review is required of the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof.
12 70. Mr. Lopez stated that "no discretionary permits have been required so far based
13 on the proposed use, and if through the code enforcement process this remains true, then the
14 CEQA process will not be necessary. We have forwarded the concerns related to biological
15 habitat to the appropriate State officials, and are awaiting their response."
16 71. Again, even though the County allegedly determined CEQA was not applicable to
17 the 12,000 square foot "mini Versailles" as an existing structure exemption, the County, not later
18 than November 14, 2017, began anew the process to determine whether CEQA applies to said
19 structure as well as the other structures and changes.
20 72. According to this November 14, 2017 email, the County was holding off on any
21 final decisions regarding the applicability of CEQA review of the George Ranch Project and
22 portions thereof, including the "mini-Versailles," pending the results of the code enforcement
23 and permit action and responses from the appropriate State officials. That was approximately six
24 months ago, and Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that any findings made
25 by the County regarding the applicability of CEQA review to the George Ranch Project through
26 its code and permit enforcement action against the same have been made within the past 180
27 days.

28

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 19

73.

2 At no time has the County issued a Notice of Exemption or any public notice

3 regarding any findings it has made regarding CEQA review. of the George Ranch Project or any

4 portions thereof as a result of their investigation into the same that began no later than Novemberl

5 14, 2017. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege the County has determined not

6 to require or conduct a CEQA review of the George Ranch project and any portions thereof,
including but not limited to:

7 a.

8 The ongoing construction of a 12,000 square foot "barn";
b.

9 The creation of a six million gallon lake and dam to stop flow of the

stream;

10 C.

11 The creation of a white sand beach alongside the lake;

d.

12 The construction of a 5,000 square foot "barn";

e.

13 The construction of a 2,000 square foot greenhouse;
f

14 The construction of a large gazebo;

g.

15 The construction of a mobile/manufactured home;

16 i The excavation and grading of pastureland for parking for up to 100 cars;

17 The installation of a brewery and/or a workshop and storage facility for

18 antique steam-powered agricultural equipment inside the 5,000 square foot
barn; and

19 -

20 The construction of a plaza courtyard containing a water fall, fireplace,
and retaining walls.

21 k.

22 The installation of a 500 feet gas line.

23 Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the County has determined

24 that the George Ranch Project, and/or portions of the same as listed above, are exempt
CEQA review, or do not qualify as a project a under CEQA, within the past 180 days. from

25

26 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

27 Failure to Direct CEQA Review of the George Ranch Project

28 The George Ranch Project is a "Project" and No Exemptions Apply

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 20

1 74. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in
2 paragraphs 1 through 73 as though fully stated herein.

3 75. Respondents are subject to the requirements of CEQA when evaluating a project

4 that may have a significant effect on the environment. The George Ranch Project is a "project,"

5 and/or the portions thereof a part of a "project," as that term is defined by CEQA, and has caused

6 and may cause direct physical changes in the environment, and carries the risk of reasonably
7 foreseeable indirect physical changes in the environment. The George Ranch Project and/or any
8 portions thereof involves or is legally required to involve the County's issuance of permits, the
9 enforcement of permits, and the enforcement of code violations.

10 76. Unless an exemption applies, or the activity does not meet the definition of a
11 project, CEQA requires governmental authorities, such as Respondents, to fully evaluate
12 potential environmental effects of projects like the George Ranch Project, and to seek feasible
13 means to reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that otherwise could result from

14 their actions. CEQA limits the County from approving projects with significant adverse impacts
15 when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen such impacts.
16 77. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege the County violated
17 CEQA because it failed to require and direct CEQA review and reporting for the George Ranch
18 Project and/or portions thereof, based on certain exemptions, and/or under the false premise and
19 unsupported assertion that the George Ranch Project does not meet the definition of a "project"
20 under CEQA.

21 78. Categorical exemptions to CEQA review, however, do not apply to the George
22 Ranch Project and/or any portion thereof, as fully described in this Petition, and the George
23 Ranch Project and/or portions thereof, meet the definition of a "project".

24 79. CEQA requires Respondents to evaluate the environmental impacts of the George
25 Ranch Project of "the whole of an action". (California Code of Regulations § 15378(A).)
26 Respondents must analyze the environmental impacts of all reasonably foreseeable portions of
27 the George Ranch Project and cannot separate this larger project into smaller ones such that each
28 individually has a lesser environmental impact than the whole together, thus ignoring the impact

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 21

1 of the George Ranch Project as a whole. (Laurel Heights Improvement Association V. Regents
2 of the University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 396.)

3 80. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that Respondents, in

4 making their findings that CEQA review does not apply to the George Ranch Project and/or
portions thereof, violated CEQA and have impermissibly and separately analyzed the 12,000
6 square foot "ag barn," the courtyard, the lake, the dam, the beach, the parking lot(s), the 5,000
square foot barn, and the gazebo that make up the George Ranch Project, as separate individual
8 projects.

81. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that Respondents have
10 violated CEQA and determined that exemptions apply individually to each portion of the entire
11 George Ranch Project, versus determining whether CEQA applies to the George Ranch Project
12 as a whole, and/or determined that each individual portion of the George Ranch Project are not a
13 "project" subject to CEQA review, as opposed to the George Ranch Project as a whole.
14 82. Had the County analyzed whether CEQA applies to the whole of the George
15 Ranch Project as an official with Planning Dept proposed in July 2014, substantial evidence
16 would have led to the undeniable conclusion that replacing an old barn with a "mini Palace of
17 a Versailles" complete with a courtyard plaza, expanding a cattle stockpond into a lake with an
18 artificial white-sand beach on the north side, damming the watercourse (stream) to create the
19 lake, grading the former rolling pastureland into parking lot(s) with space for 100 cars, and
20 erecting a barn with a brewery or a workshop and storage shed for antique, steam-powered farm
21 equipment, would create and has created significant and multiple environmental impacts more
22 than sufficient to meet the definition of a project to trigger CEQA review a and a report on the
23 same.

24 83. Furthermore, there are exceptions to the categorical exemptions under CEQA.
25 California Code of Regulations § 15300.2(b) and (c), state:
26 (b) Cumulative Impact. All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the
27 cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is
28 significant.

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPJAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 22

1. (c) Significant Effect. A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where
2. there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the

3 environment due to unusual circumstances. (California Code of Regulations §

4 15300.2(b) and (c), emphasis added.)

5 84. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that if any exemptions do

6 apply to the George Ranch Project, which Petitioners deny, these exceptions to the exemptions

7 preclude the County from relying on the exemptions to foreclose CEQA review and reporting.
8 85. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the George Ranch
9 Project and/or portions of the same, both permitted and non-permitted work, are the subject of
10 the County's ongoing code and permit enforcement action (as of November 14, 2017), and the
11 County's determination as to whether CEQA applies.
12 86. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the County violated
13 CEQA and made unlawful findings that the George Ranch Project and/or any portions thereof
14 are not subject to CEQA compliance because of certain exemptions, or because it does not meet
15 the definition of a "project" under CEQA, as a part of its code and permit enforcement action at
16 the George Ranch Project.

17 87. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that no exemptions under
18 CEQA apply to the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof, and challenge Respondents'
19 findings to the contrary as unlawful.
20 88. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the George Ranch
21 Project and all a portions thereof, is a "project" under CEQA, and challenge Respondents' findings
22 to the contrary as unlawful.

23 89. Petitioners seek a writ of mandate revoking, rescinding, or voiding any and all
24 decisions, determinations and/or findings of the County that the George Ranch Project, and any
25 portions thereof, are exempt from CEQA compliance.
26 90. Petitioners seek a writ of mandate revoking, rescinding, or voiding any and all
27 decisions, determinations and/or findings of the County that the George Ranch Project, and any
28 portions thereof, do not meet the definition of a "project" under CEQA.

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 23

1 91. Petitioners seek a writ of mandate revoking, rescinding, or voiding any and all
2 authorizations for construction of the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof issued by the

3 County in reliance on the County's unlawful findings that CEQA compliance is not required.

4 92. Petitioners are entitled to recover attorneys' fees as provided in Code of Civil

S Procedure section 1021.5 if they prevail in this action and the Court finds a significant benefit
6 has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons, and that the necessity and
7 burden of private enforcement is such as to make an award of fees appropriate.

8 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

g Failure to Conduct CEQA Review of the George Ranch Project

10 93. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in
11 paragraphs 1 through 92 as though fully stated herein.
12 94. Respondents are subject to the requirements of CEQA when evaluating a project
13 a that may have a significant effect on the environment. The George Ranch Project is a "project,"
14 and/or the portions thereof a part of a "project," as that term is defined by CEQA, and has causedl
15 and may cause direct physical changes in the environment, and carries the risk of reasonably
16 foreseeable indirect physical changes in the environment. The George Ranch Project and/or any
17 portions thereof involves the County's issuance of permits, the enforcement of permits, and the
18 enforcement of code violations.

19 95. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that as a result of
20 Respondents' unlawful findings that the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof are
21 exempt from CEQA and/or are not a "project" under CEQA, Respondents further violated
22 CEQA by failing to conduct and/or prepare an Initial Study and a report on the same.
23 96. Petitioners seek a writ of mandate directing Respondents to comply with CEQA
24 with respect to the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof, and ordering Respondents to
25 prepare and complete an Initial Study under CEQA.

26 97. Petitioners are entitled to recover attorneys' fees as provided in Code of Civil
27 Procedure section 1021.5 if it prevails in this action and the Court finds a significant benefit has
28

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 24

1 been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons, and that the necessity and
2 burden of private enforcement is such as to make an award of fees appropriate.

3 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

4 Declaratory Relief

5 98. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in
6 paragraphs through 97 as though fully stated herein.

7 99. A dispute and an actual controversy exists between Petitioners and Respondents
8 concerning their rights and duties in that Petitioners contend, and Respondents deny, the
9 following:

10 a. That the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof is "project" under
11 CEQA;

12 b. That no exemptions apply to permit the County to forgo CEQA review of the
13 George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof, including but not limited to, conducting an Initial
14 Study and preparing a report of the same,

15 C. That CEQA review of the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof,
16 including but not limited to, conducting an Initial Study and preparing a report of the same is
17 required;

18 d That Petitioners fundamental rights have been violated.
19 100. Petitioners desire a judicial determination of the respective rights and duties of
20 Petitioners and Respondents with respect to CEQA applicability to the George Ranch Project
21 and/or portions thereof

22 101. Such declarations are necessary and appropriate at this time in order that
23 Petitioners and Respondents may ascertain Respondents obligations under CEQA with respect to
24 the George Ranch Project and Petitioners rights.
25 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

26 Injunctive Relief

27 102. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in
28 1 paragraphs 1 through 101 as though fully stated herein.

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 25

103. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege Respondents have
2 unlawfully issued authorizations for construction of the George Ranch Project and/or portions
3 thereof in violation of CEQA, and have determined, despite an ongoing investigation into both

4 the permitted and unpermitted work on the George Ranch Project, that CEQA does not apply.
5 Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege the County unlawfully determined the

6 George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof are exempt from CEQA or do not qualify as a
7 "project".

8 104. Construction of the mini Versailles continues unabated, as does the plaza.
9 Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege the brewing activities continue, and large
10 events continue to be held on a regular basis, using Morrison Canyon Road as access.
11 105. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege large events, such as
12 weddings, are set to be held at George Ranch this summer.
13 106. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege the damage done to the
14 environment already and in the future as a result of the George Ranch Project and/or portions
15 thereof and the illegal uses of the same, will continue unmitigated unless the County and Real
16 Parties in Interest are ordered to halt construction pending a judgment by this Court that CEQA
17 review and reporting is required, to suspend the issuance of any permits for the George Ranch
18 Project and any portion thereof pending a judgment by this Court that CEQA review and
19 reporting is required, and to restrict event use of George Ranch.
20 107. Petitioners demanded and requested that Respondents and Real Parties in Interest
21 refrain from the conduct alleged herein and sought CEQA compliance, but Respondents failed
22 and refused the requests and, unless restrained by an order of this court, will continue
23 construction of the George Ranch Project, and continue to authorize construction and
2.4 impermissible uses of George Ranch.

25 108. By reason of the wrongful and unlawful acts, Petitioners have and will sustain
26 great and irreparable injury as described herein with respect to habitat and waterway alteration
27 and/or destruction and increased traffic and the safety issues presented due to the condition of
28

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 26

1 Morrison Canyon Road. It will be impossible for Petitioners to obtain adequate relief by way of
money damages, and therefore, is without an adequate remedy at law.
109. Petitioners seek temporary stay order, temporary restraining order, and
preliminary and permanent injunctions restraining Real Parties in Interest and Respondents, their
5 agents, employees, officers, and representatives from undertaking any construction, grading,
excavation, order or delivery of construction materials, installation or development, issuing any
construction or development approvals or permits, making any contracts, allowing or sponsoring
8 any large gatherings or assemblies whether for public use or private enjoyment in the
9 "agricultural barn" or on other portions of the George Ranch Project, or taking any other action
10 to implement in any way the George Ranch Project and any portion thereof pending judgment of
11 this Court and/or compliance with EQA.

12 WHEREFORE, Petitioners request judgment against Respondents as follows:
13 1. For a writ of mandate directing Respondents to set aside the claimed exemption(s)
14 from CEQA and/or that the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof are not a "project"
15 subject to CEQA;

16 2. a For a writ of mandate directing Respondents to comply with CEQA with respect
17 to the George Ranch Project and ordering Respondents to prepare and complete an Initial Study
18 under CEQA and applicable reporting;

19 3. A judgment declaring that a fundamental vested right a of the Petitioners is
20 adversely affected.

21 4. For a temporary stay order, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and
22 permanent injunctions restraining Real Parties in Interest and Respondents, their agents,
23 employees, officers, and representatives from undertaking any construction, grading, excavation, l
24 order or delivery of construction materials, installation or development, issuing any construction

To Alameda County Board of Supervisors:

Please take notice that on May 18, 2018, Petitioners Kelly Abreau and the Mission Peak Conservancy will file a Petition for Writ of Mandate in Alameda County Superior Court challenging actions of the County of Alameda, by and through its Community Development Agency, Building Inspection Department, Planning Department, Public Works Agency, and Board of Supervisors ("the County") with respect to the structures and alterations of land and
water on properties commonly known as 3505 Morrison Canyon Road, and 3163 Morrison Canyon Road, located in an unincorporated portion of Alameda County near Fremont,
California, known as the George Ranch Project.

Petitioners specifically challenge the County's decision(s) not to conduct a review and prepare a report complying with the provisions set forth under the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000, et seq. ("CEQA") with respect to the George
Ranch Project and/or any portions thereof, both permitted and non-permitted, including, but not
limited to, those that are or were the subject(s) of a code and permit enforcement action in which
the County made the determination(s) that CEQA does not apply, despite overwhelming
evidence to the contrary.

Petitioners also challenge the County's issuance of Building Permit Number BLD2017.
02969 on November 21, 2017, Building Permit Number BLD2018-01508, issued on May 8,
2018, and all other permits the County issued for the George Ranch Project, without complying

20 Plaintiff and Petitioner UNIVERSITY CITY COMMUNITY FOUNDATION ("Petitioner")
21 alleges as follows:
22 Parties

23 1. Petitioner is a non-profit organization formed and operating under the laws of the State

24 of California. At least one of Petitioner's members resides in, or near, the University City community
25 of City of San Diego, California, and has an interest in, among other things, ensuring open, accountable,
26 and responsive government and in protecting University City's quality of life.
27 2. Defendant and Respondent CITY OF SAN DIEGO ("CITY') is a "public agency" a
28 under Section 21063 of the Public Resources Code and a "local government" under Section 30109 of

10. Petitioner exhausted administrative remedies to the extent required by law; by way of

2 example and without limitation, one or more of Petitioner's members submitted written comments to

3 the Respondents prior to the close of the public meeting on the Project.

4 11. Respondents' conduct in approving this Project without complying with CEQA and

5 other applicable laws constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion becausc, as alleged in this pleading,

0 they failed to proceed in a manner required by law,
12. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course oflaw, since
its members and other members of the public will suffer irreparable harm as a result of Respondents'
violations of CEQA and other applicable laws, Respondents' approval of the Project also rests on their

10 failure to satisfy a clear, present, ministerial duty to act in accordance with the applicable laws. Even
11 when Respondents are permitted or required by law to exercise their discretion in approving projects
12 under those laws, they remain under a clear, present, ministerial duty to exercise their discretion within
13 the limits of and in a manner consistent with those laws. Respondents have had and continue to have
14 the capacity and ability to approve the Project within the time limits of and in a manner consistent with
15 those laws, but Respondents have failed and refused to do so and have exercised their discretion beyond
16 the limits of and in a manner that is not consistent with those laws.

17 13. Petitioner has a beneficial right and interest in Respondents' fulfillment of all their legal
18 duties, as alleged in this pleading.

19 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION:

20 Illegal Approval and Adoption of Project (Against Äll Respondents and Real Parties in Interest)
21 14. Paragraphs through 13 are fully incorporated into this paragraph.

22 15. The Project does not comply with all applicable laws. By way of example and not

23 limitation (including alternative theories of liability):
24 A. The Project violates CEQA. In particular:

25 i. CEQA requires that every environmental impact report ("EIR.") identify

26 and analyze the significant adverse environmental impacts of a proposed project, giving due
27 consideration to both short-term and long-term impacts, providing decision-makers with enough

28 information to enable them to make an informed decision with full knowledge of the likely

VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ETC. Page 3

vii. Respondents approved the Project based on one or more written findings
2 that there exist considerations outweighing the Project's significant adverse environmental impacts, but
3 there is not substantial evidence in the administrative record to support all such findings. Additionally

4 and alternatively, Respondents approved the Project based on one or more non-written findings that

5 such considerations exist. Respondents also failed to make all required written findings regarding the
6 Project's impacts as required by CEQA.
viii. Respondents' approval of the Project based on one or more written

8 findings unsupported by evidence in the administrative record and their failure to make all written

9 findings required regarding the Project's impacts constitute multiple violations of CEQA.

10 ix. As a result of Respondents's violations of CEQA, Petitioner, its members,

11 and the general public have been harmed insofar as the responsible decision-makers were not fully
12 informed about the potential adverse environmental impacts of the Project, and insofar as Petitioner,
13 its members, and the general public did not have an opportunity to participate meaningfully in the
14 analysis of such impacts prior to approval of the Project.
15 16. There is currently a dispute between Petitioner and Respondents over the Project's legal
16 force and effect. Petitioner contends that the Project has no legal force or effect because it violates
17 CEQA and/or one or more other applicable laws. Respondents dispute Petitioner's contention. The
18 parties therefore require a judicial determination of the Project's legal force and effect (if any).
19 Prayer

20 FOR ALL THESE REASONS, Petitioner respectfully prays for the following relief against
21 Respondents (and any and all other parties who may oppose Petitioner in this proceeding):
22 A. A judgment or other appropriate order determining or declaring that Respondents failed

23 to fully comply with CEQA and/or one or more other applicable laws as they relate to the Project and

24 that there must be full compliance therewith before final approval and implementation of the Project

25 may occur;
26 B. A judgment or other appropriate order determining or declaring that Respondents failed
27 to comply with CEQA and/or one or more other applicable laws as they relate to the Project and that
