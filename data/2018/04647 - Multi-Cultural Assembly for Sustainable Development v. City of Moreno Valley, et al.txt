INTRODUCTION 19
25 br4 1. This action
26 challenges the approval by the City of Moreno Valley on or about June
19, 2018 of the Rancho Belago Phase II/Moreno Valley Ranch Golf Course 27 Apartments Project, which proposes the development of a 417-unit residential 28
a housing complex on vacant golf course site at the southeasterly intersection of John

-1-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

F. Kennedy Drive and Moreno Beach Drive in the eastern area of the City. Petitioner, |
Multi-Cultural Assembly For Sustainable Development, opposes the Project because
in its current form the Project brings adverse, unmitigated environmental impacts to
4 the surrounding single-family community including aesthetic, noise, and traffic
impacts, among others.

6 2. The California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") (Public Resources Code con
7 21000 et seq.) requires an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for any project that
8 a may have a significant adverse effect on the environment. Despite reasoned
9 comments in the record regarding the Project's significant environmental effects, the
10 City of Moreno Valley declined to prepare an EIR for the Project, instead relying
11 upon a lesser level of CEQA review, a Mitigated Negative Declaration, which was in
12 error.

13 3. As a result of the CEQA violations, Petitioner respectfully requests issuance of a
14 peremptory writ of mandate setting aside the approvals of the Project including:
15 approval of a Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND"'), a General Plan Amendment,
16 a Specific Plan Amendment, a Zone Change, a Tentative Parcel Map, a Plot Plan, and
17 all associated approvals (collectively, the "Project").
18 4. By this verified petition, Petitioner alleges the following:
19 PARTIES

20 5. Petitioner, MULTI-CULTURAL ASSEMBLY FOR SUSTAINABLE
21 DEVELOPMENT, is an unincorporated association of residents of the City of
22 Moreno Valley created because of concerns about land use, the environment, and
23 quality of life issues in the City of Moreno Valley. Petitioner includes individuals
24 who own property in and/or reside in the City of Moreno Valley in proximity to the
25 Project site. Members of Petitioner and Petitioner's counsel submitted comments
26 opposing approval of the Project to the City, which has discretionary approval
27 authority over the Project.
28

-2-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 6. Respondent, CITY OF MORENO VALLEY, is a political subdivision of the State of
Nm t. California. The City is a local governmental agency charged with the authority of
regulating and administering local land use and development within its territory in
compliance with the provisions of its general plan and zoning ordinances as well as
applicable provisions of State law, including CEQA. The City is the lead agency for
6 the Project and is therefore charged with the duty of ensuring compliance with
7 applicable laws.
8 7. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that Real Party in Interest,
9 ROC III CA BELAGO, LLC, is the applicant for the Project, has an ownership
10 interest in the property, and/or claims an interest in the Project approvals at the
11 subject of this lawsuit.

12 8. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that Real Party in Interest,
13 ROC III CA RESERVE RANCHO BELAGO, LLC, is the applicant for the Project,
14 has an ownership interest in the property, and/or claims an interest in the Project
15 approvals at the subject of this lawsuit.
16 9. DOES 1 through 100 are individuals or entities that may have an ownership interest in
17 the property, were project applicants, or claim an interest in approvals at the subject of
18 this lawsuit. Petitioner is unaware of the true names or capacities of the Real Parties in
19 Interest identified herein under the fictitious names DOES 1 through 100 inclusive.
20 STATEMENT OF FACTS

21 The Project

22 10. The Project will develop a multi-family residential apartment complex comprising
23 417 units within eighteen buildings on an approximately 22-acre irregularly shaped
24 site. The vacant site was previously used as a driving range for the Moreno Valley
25 Ranch Golf Course, which closed in 2015. The entire golf course site comprises more
26 than two hundred acres, of which the Project will develop approximately 22 acres.
27 11. The Project also entails the construction of a club house, recreational facilities,
28

-3-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

- Nmto parking, landscaping, outdoor lighting of parking areas, common open space, street
improvements and other ancillary facilities. The Project also includes an agreement
between the City and the developer for partial and temporary re-opening of the golf
course in some capacity in conjunction with the development of the Project's
residential uses.

6 12. Nine of the Project buildings will be four-stories, up to at least 50 feet in height.
7 13. The Project will generate 3,559 daily vehicle trips, 224 during the morning peak hour
8 and 286 during the evening peak hour according to the Project's traffic study. The
9 Project's "main entry" is Moreno Beach Drive. A secondary access at Championship
10 Drive is for emergency vehicles only. The traffic study states there will be a third
11 access point to the north from John F. Kennedy Drive, but this is a shared driveway
12 with the existing golf course clubhouse. This third access point will pass through the
13 golf course parking lot.
14 14. The Project site is surrounded on three sides by single-family detached residential
15 homes.

16 15. The Project site abuts the Mount Russell area directly to the south. The City
17 considers the Mount Russell area to be a scenic view.

18 16. The Project site is within the planning area of the Moreno Valley Ranch Specific Plan
19 which was originally approved on July 25, 1985.
20 17. The Project includes the following approvals and entitlements:
21 a, Certification of a Mitigated Negative Declaration and adoption of a
22 Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program;
23 b. A General Plan Amendment to modify the current General Plan Land Use
24 Map to change the Project site's land use designation from Open Space
25 (OS) to Residential 20 multi-family (R20);
26 C. A Specific Plan Amendment to the Moreno Valley Ranch Specific Plan to
27 change approximately 22 acres of Open Space land currently designated for

"golf course" use to "multi-family" High Density Residential land use to
N 0 T0O0 allow residential density of 17 to 20 dwelling units per acre as well as text
revisions to the Specific Plan to "articulate the desired character, quality,
infrastructure, and phasing of the proposed residential component as well as
the necessary improvements to the remaining portions of the former
operating golf course";
d. Tentative Parcel Map No. 37189 to subdivide one parcel into four parcels

8 for residential and golf course purposes;
9 e. A Zone Change to change the site's zoning designation from SP193 Golf
10 Course to SP193 High Density Residential;
11 f. A Plot Plan for a 417 unit residential apartment project subject to
12 Conditions of Approval;
13 Administrative Process

14 18. On or about March 16, 2018, the City prepared an Initial Study for the Project
15 pursuant to CEQA, and on or about March 22, 2018, the City published notice of the
16 availability of the Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration stating that the public
17 comment period on the Mitigated Negative Declaration closes on April 23, 2018.
18 19.On April 12, 2018, prior to the close of the public comment period on the Mitigated
19 Negative Declaration, the City's Planning Commission held a public hearing on the
20 Project and voted to recommend that the City Council approve the Project including
21 adoption of the Mitigated Negative Declaration.
22 20. On June 19, 2018, the City of Moreno Valley City Council held a public hearing on
23 the Project. After taking public comment, the City Council approved the Project
24 including "certification" of the Mitigated Negative Declaration.
25 21. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges that, the City filed and posted
26 the Project's Notice of Determination pursuant to CEQA on or about June 20, 2018.
27 22. The maintenance of this action is for the purpose of enforcing important public
28

-5-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 policies of the State of California with respect to the protection of the environment
2 under CEQA and conformance with state law. The maintenance and prosecution of
3 this action will confer a substantial benefit upon the public by protecting the public
4 from environmental and other harms alleged in this Petition. Petitioner is acting as a
5 private attorney general to enforce these public policies and prevent such harm.
6 23. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing the action by complying
7 with the requirements of Public Resources Code section 21167.5, in notifying
8 Respondent of the filing of this action (attached hereto as Exhibit "A"), and by
9 complying with the requirements of Public Resources Code section 21167.6, in

10 notifying Respondent of Petitioner's election to prepare the record of proceedings in
11 connection with this action (attached hereto as Exhibit "B").
12 24. The City's approval of the Project will cause Petitioner irreparable injury for which
13 Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law. Petitioner and its members will be
14 irreparably harmed by the City's actions in approving the Project. Petitioner is
15 harmed by, among other things, the failure of the City to require the preparation of a
16 EIR to adequately evaluate the potential impacts of the Project, and by the City's
17 approval of the Project without providing adequate and effective mitigation measures
18 contrary to the requirements of State law.

19 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES
20| 25. Members of Petitioner and counsel for Petitioner commented that the CEQA review
21 was inadequate in that the Initial Study fails to properly disclose and evaluate impacts
22 and/or support its conclusions with evidence; that the Project would have potentially
23 significant impacts to/from the following: aesthetics, air quality, biology, greenhouse
24 gas emissions, noise, and traffic; and that the City did not adopt adequate mitigation
25 for these potential effects or adopt all feasible mitigation.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 26. Members of Petitioner and Petitioner's counsel raised written and verbal objections to
2 the City Council prior to the close of the public hearing and the posting of the Notice
3 of Determination for the Project.

4 27. Accordingly, Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges that, Petitioner
5 exhausted its administrative remedies pursuant to the requirements of Public

6 Resources Code § 21177.

7 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

8 28. This Court has jurisdiction to issue writs of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure

9 Section 1094.5.

10 29. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Sections 393 and
11 394 as the Project is located in, and the relevant events occurred in, Riverside County,
12 and because the City is located in Riverside County.
13

14 CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (WRIT OF MANDATE- VIOLATIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA

16 ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT, AS TO ALL PARTIES)

17 a. The City wrongly adopted : Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Project when there was substantial evidence of a fair argument of significant
18 environmental impacts as a result of the Project.
19 30. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 29 above as though

20 set forth in full herein.

21 31. As the lead agency, Respondent City is charged with the duty to fully and accurately

22 consider the environmental consequences of the Project through the preparation of an

23 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"). (Public Resources Code, § 21080 (d).)
24 32. The EIR requirement is the "heart of CEQA." (Cal. Code of Regs., Tit. 14 "State

25 CEQA Guidelines," § 15003(a).)
26 33. An EIR is required for any proposed project that may have a significant effect on the

27 environment. (Public Resources Code, § 21100 (a).)

28

-7.
VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 34. If a lead agency is presented with a "fair argument" based on substantial evidence in
2 the record that a proposed project may have a significant effect on the environment,
3 the lead agency shall prepare an EIR even though it may be presented with other
4 substantial evidence that the proposed project will not have a significant effect. (State
5 CEQA Guidelines, § 15064(f)(1).)
6 35.A lead agency may prepare a mitigated negative declaration for a project only when:
7 (1) revisions in the project would avoid or mitigate the potentially significant project
8 effects to a point where clearly no significant effects would occur; and (2) there is no
9 substantial evidence in light of the whole record that the project as revised may have a

10 significant effect on the environment. (State CEQA Guidelines, § 15070 (b).)
11 36. The City was presented with substantial evidence of a fair argument that the Project
12 may significantly affect the environment within the meanings of CEQA for impacts
13 to/from, but not limited to, aesthetics, air quality, biology, greenhouse gas emissions,
14 noise, and traffic.
15 37. Petitioner submitted comments to the City based on substantial evidence that the
16 Project may result in significant environmental impacts that were not adequately
17 evaluated and/or mitigated, for example:
18 a. Petitioner submitted comments that the record supports a fair argument of
19 significant aesthetic impacts. Residences to the north of the Project site
20 currently have views of open space and the scenic Mount Russell area
21 across the Project site. The Project replaces this natural view with
22 numerous four-story, 50-foot buildings. This represents an adverse change
23 to the physical environment, and, therefore, a significant aesthetic impact.
24 (State CEQA Guidelines, § 15382.)

25 b. Petitioner submitted comments that the record supports fair argument of
26 significant air quality impacts. In particular, air quality mitigation is not
27 shown to reduce significant operational NO% impacts below significance
28

-8-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

I

Ja0 A0 N thresholds where the purported air quality mitigation measures are not
reasonably related to mobile emissions - the primary source of NOx
emissions.

C. Petitioner submitted comments that the record supports a fair argument
with respect to Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHGs). The Mitigated
Negative Declaration states that GHG emissions are reduced below the

8 applicable threshold of significance as a result of Project mitigation

9 measures AQ-2 through AQ-5. But these measures are not shown through

10 evidence to reduce GHG emissions; nor are these measures even reasonably

11 related to the primary sources of GHG emissions due the Project - namely

12 mobile sources or energy demand.

13 d. Petitioner submitted comments in the record that the record supports fair

14 argument of significant biological impacts. The Project's biological report

15 states that the on-site riparian area "may be subject to regulation as

16 jurisdictional waters. Prior to any work in these areas, consultation with the

17 U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, [RWQCB]-Santa Ana Region, and

18 California Department of Fish and Wildlife is recommended." The

19 Mitigated Negative Declaration was apparently not sent to these resource

20 agencies for review and/or resource agencies recommended further analysis

21 and mitigation which was not done or adopted. Also, for instance, with

22 respect to the Los Angeles Pocket Mouse, a state-threatened species, the

23 biological study recommends "further surveys for this species to confirm

24 the presence of LAPM in the project area." However, these further surveys
were not performed.
25 38. By adopting a Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Project where there is
26

27 substantial evidence supporting a fair argument that the Project may result in

28 significant environmental effects, the City committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion

-9-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

I and the Project approvals must be set aside. (Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085,

2 1094.5; Pub. Res. Code, § 21168.)

3 b. The Initial Study Fails as an Informational Document.
4 39. The purposes of the CEQA Initial Study are to "[p]rovide the Lead Agency with
10. information to use as the basis for deciding whether to prepare an EIR or a Negative
Declaration" and "[p]rovide documentation of the factual basis for the finding in a
7 Negative Declaration that a project will not have a significant effect on the

8 environment." (emphasis added)
9 40. Under CEQA, a prejudicial abuse of discretion may occur when relevant information
10 is not presented to the public agency. "When the informational requirements of
11 CEQA are not complied with, an agency has failed to proceed in 'a manner required
12 by law' and has therefore abused its discretion." (Lighthouse Field Beach Rescue v.
13 City of Santa Cruz (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 1170, 1200.) "The failure to comply with
14 the law subverts the purposes of CEQA if it omits material necessary to informed

15 decisionmaking and informed public participation." (Lighthouse, supra, 131
16 Cal.App.4th at 1201.)
17 41. CEQA also requires that the lead agency investigate impacts. "CEQA places the
18 burden of environmental investigation on government rather than the public." (Gentry
19 V. City of Murrieta (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 1359, 1379.) "Where an agency ... fails to
20 gather information and undertake an adequate environmental analysis in its initial
21 study, a negative declaration is inappropriate. (City of Redlands v. County of San
22 Bernardino (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 398, 406-408.)
23 42. Petitioner and others commented that the Initial Study fails to substantiate the
24 conclusions of less-than-significant. For example, there is no noise study or other
25 evidence to support the conclusion of less-than-significant noise impacts. The Initial
26 Study fails to discuss relevant noise thresholds, e.g., there is no discussion of the City
27 of Moreno Valley Municipal Code which regulates residential noise So that noise shall
28

-I0-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 not exceed 60 dBA daytime and 55 dBA nighttime (Municipal Code § 11.80.030(C));

3 and there is no discussion of Section 11.80.030 in terms of short-term (construction),

4 impulsive (construction) or maximum sound levels (operational noise).

5 43.By adopting Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Project where there is a lack of

6 information and evidence supporting the conclusions of the Initial Study, the City

7 committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and the Project approvals must be set

8 aside. (Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085, 1094.5; Pub. Res. Code, § 21168.)

c.

9 Mitigation Measures are Uncertain, Unenforceable, and Improperly Deferred,

10 44. CEQA requires that a public agency ensure that mitigation measures are fully

11 enforceable, certain to occur, and not improperly deferred. (Public Resources Code, c0
21081.6 (b); State CEQA Guidelines, § 15097.)
12 45. The City approved the Project where mitigation measures are uncertain to occur, are
13

14 unenforceable and/or deferred. For instance, traffic mitigation measure CIR-5 is

15 uncertain where it calls for the applicant to "participate" in the "phased construction

16 of off-site traffic signals" through "payment of traffic signal mitigation fees." So-

17 called fair share mitigation based on a project's contribution to a cumulative impact is

18 appropriate when the payment is tied to an actual plan of mitigation, when the amount

19 of funding is identified, and when there is some reasonable indication that the

20 mitigation measure (the subject of the funds) will be implemented. The Project's

21 traffic mitigation program does not meet these legal standards.

22 46. The Project's Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program states that the

23 "Applicant/Developer" is wholly responsible for mitigation compliance, which is not

24 consistent with CEQA. State CEQA Guidelines § 15097 provides that the lead

25 agency remains responsible for ensuring that implementation of mitigation measures

26 occurs in accordance with the adopted mitigation program.

27

28

-11-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 47. By approving the Project when mitigation measures are not fully enforceable, the City
2 committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion for which the Project approvals must be
3 set aside. (Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085, 1094.5; Public Resources Code, §

4 21168.)
5 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for the following relief on all causes of action:

6 48. For the Court's peremptory writ of mandate requiring Respondent, City of Moreno
7 Valley, to set aside its decision approving the Mitigated Negative Declaration for the

8 Project. (Public Resources Code, §§ 21168, 21168.9; Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1094.5,
9 1085)

10 49. For the Court's peremptory writ of mandate requiring Respondent, City of Moreno
11 Valley, to set aside all Project approvals. (Public Resources Code, §§ 21168, 21168.9,
12 Code Civ. Proc., $§ 1094.5, 1085.)
13 50. For the Court's peremptory writ of mandate requiring Respondent, City of Moreno
14 Valley, to fully comply with the requirements of CEQA prior to any future approval
15 of the Project. (Public Resources Code, §§ 21168, 21168.9, Code Civ. Proc., §§
16 1094.5, 1085.)

17 51. For costs of this suit, including attorney's fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, §
18 1021.5 and other provisions of law.

19 52. For such other and further relief, including a stay or preliminary and permanent
20 injunctive relief, in the event that the Real Parties in Interest, or their agents or
21 instrumentalities, intend to commence construction on the site. (Code of Civil
22 Procedure § 526.)
