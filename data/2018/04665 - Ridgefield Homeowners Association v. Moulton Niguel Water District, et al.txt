21 INTRODUCTION

22 1. In this action, Petitioner, Ridgefield Homeowners Association challenges:
23 Respondents', Moulton Niguel Water District and Board of Directors of Moulton Niguel Water
24 District (collectively "MNWD"), approval of: the Moulton Niguel Water District Operations

25 Center and Site Consolidation Project (the "Project"); Certification and adoption of a Final

26 Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND") for the Project; and Adoption of a Mitigation
27 Monitoring and Reporting Program ("MMRP").

28 2. The Project site is located at 26161 Gordon Road in the city of Laguna Hills and

F Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 consists of 11.33 acres. The site is currently used for MNWD operations and includes eight
2 structures primarily located on the eastern portion of the site. These structures include and
3 perform the following functions: gas pumps and underground storage, warehouse storage,
4 electrical shop, pipe storage shed, meter maintenance shop, telemetry, vehicle maintenance and
5 field operations. The western portion of the site previously included two water features which
6 functioned as habitat for variety of birds and wildlife. These features were drained by MNWD
7 in 2015 and are now proposed for development. MNWD administrative activities are housed at a
8 separate location at 27500 La Paz Road in the city of Laguna Niguel.

3. The Project proposes to consolidate MNWD's administrative and operational
10 functions currently located at two separate locations onto the Project site. Proposed construction
11 includes: construction of a two-story operations center on the western portion of the project site,
12 consisting of 46,257 square feet; construction of two one-story buildings housing shop uses and
13 fleet uses totaling 18,407 square feet; installation of gas pumps and construction of fuel storage
14 for 20,000 gallons; renovation of two warehouse buildings consisting of 21,735 square feet; and
15 extensive parking for personnel and associated site uses.
16 4. Personnel and administrative functions at the existing administration building at
17 27500 La Paz Road will be relocated to the Project site. MNWD proposes no use or plans for
18 reuse at this location and the MND includes no environmental review of impacts of leaving the
19 location vacant or future uses for the site.
20 5. As the designated "Lead Agency" (Pub. Res. Code § 21067) for the Project,
21 MNWD filed a Notice of Determination for the MND on or about July 13, 2018. MNWD
22 certified and adopted the MND despite serious concerns expressed by citizens (including
23 Petitioner) and experts regarding the MND's omissions and errors, the Project's significant
24 environmental impacts, the adequacy of review and analysis of these impacts in the MND, and
25 the adequacy of mitigation measures or alternatives proposed to reduce or mitigate these impacts.
26 Members of the public, including Petitioner, expressed concern about and identified the
27 Project's: use of an improper baseline when analyzing biological impacts; inconsistency with the
28

2 Petition for Writ of Mandate

applicable land use plan and zoning and resulting unmitigated significant impacts; cumulative
2 growth inducement from proposed city-wide zoning changes; unmitigated significant noise and
3 aesthetic impacts; unanalyzed and unmitigated geology and soils impacts; unmitigated and
4 unanalyzed hazards and hazardous materials impacts; and impermissible deferral of mitigation,
5 among others.
6 6. As approved, there is substantial evidence that the Project may have significant
7 unmitigated environmental impacts including but not limited to impacts in the areas of light and
8 glare, geology and soils, hazards & hazardous materials, land use/planning, growth inducement
9 and noise and mitigation is impermissibly deferred in impact areas. An Environmental Impact
10 Report ("EIR") is required and contrary evidence is not adequate to support MNWD's decision
11 to dispense with preparation of an EIR.
12 7. In approving the Project, MNWD has failed to comply with the California
13 Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Res. Code 21000 et seq., herein "CEQA"). Petitioner
14 therefore petitions this Court for a writ of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085 and
15 1094.5 directing Respondent MNWD to vacate and set aside its approval of the Project and
16 adoption and certification of the MND and MMRP for the Project. These claims are based on
17 the following allegations:
18 JURISDICTION AND VENUE
19 8. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to §§ 1085, 1094.5, and 187
20 of the California Code of Civil Procedure and §§ 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources
21 Code.
22 9. Venue for this action properly lies in the Orange County Superior Court because
23 Respondents and the proposed site of the Project are located in Orange County.
24 THE PARTIES
25 10. Petitioner RIDGEFIELD HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION ("RIDGEFIELD") is
26 a California Nonprofit Mutual Benefit Corporation. Ridgefield and its homeowner members will
27 be impacted by the Project's light and glare, geology and soils, hazards and hazardous materials,
28

m Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 land use/planning, growth inducement and noise as its members live adjacent to the Project site,
2 use their property for residential, recreational and open space uses and intend to continue these
3 uses. Ridgefield submitted timely comments on the Project, the Project's impacts, the
4 inadequacy of the Draft and Final MND and its representatives testified at hearings on the
5 Project before MNWD. Ridgefield and its members are directly, adversely and irreparably
6 affected, and will continue to be prejudiced by the Project and its components, as described
7 herein, until and unless this Court provides the relief prayed for in this petition. The
8 maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a substantial benefit on the public by
9 protecting the public from the environmental and other harms alleged herein.
10 11. Petitioner has a direct and beneficial interest in Respondents' compliance with
11 CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, State Planning and Zoning Law and the General Plan and Zoning
12 Code of the City of Laguna Hills. These interests will be directly and adversely affected by the
13 Project, which violates provisions of law as set forth in this Petition and which would cause
14 irreversible harm to the natural environment.
15 12. Respondent MNWD is California water district, organized pursuant to the
16 California Water District Law, Water Code section 34000 et seq., subject at all times to the
17 obligations and limitations of all applicable state, federal, and other laws, including CEQA, the
18 CEQA Guidelines and California Planning and Zoning Law. As the CEQA Lead Agency for the
19 Project, MNWD adopted and certified the MND and approved the Project.
20 13. Respondent BOARD OF DIRECTOR OF MNWD ("BOARD") is the decision
21 making and legislative body of MNWD, subject at all times to the obligations and limitations of
22 all applicable state, federal, and other laws, including CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines and
23 California Planning and Zoning Law. As the decision making and legislative body of the CEQA
24 Lead Agency for the Project, BOARD adopted and certified the MND and approved the Project.
25 14. Petitioner is currently unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents,
26 Does 1 through 20, inclusive, and therefore sue those parties by such fictitious names. Does -
27 through 20, inclusive, are agents of MNWD, state, or federal government who are responsible in
28

4 Petition for Writ of Mandate

I some manner for the conduct described in this petition, or other persons or entities presently
2 unknown to Petitioner who claim some legal or equitable interest in the Project that is the subject
3 of this action. Petitioner will amend this petition to show the true names and capacities of Does
4 through 20 when such names and capacities become known.
5 15. Petitioner is currently unaware of the true names and capacities of Real Parties in
6 Interest, Does 21 through 50, inclusive. Does 21 through 50, inclusive, are persons or entities
7 presently unknown to Petitioner who are agents of MNWD, state, or federal government who are
8 responsible in some manner for the conduct described in this petition, claim some legal or
9 equitable interest in the Project that is the subject of this action. Petitioner will amend this
10 petition to show the true names and capacities of Does 21 through 50 when such names and
11 capacities become known.
12 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY
13 16. The Project proposes construction of 96,714 square feet, substantial grading
14 (41,115 cubic yards of cut and 31,987 cubic yard of fill) to establish a consolidated operations
15 center for MNWD,
16 17. On March 20, 2018, MNWD issued a Draft Initial Study/MND for the Project.
17 Petitioner and other members of the public submitted written comments on the Draft MND and
18 requested preparation of an EIR due to the existence of substantial evidence that the Project
19 would have significant unmitigated project impacts.
20 18. On or about June 25, 2018, MNWD issued a revised Final Initial Study/MND.
21 Petitioner submitted additional comments on the final document and unmitigated Project impacts
22 and continued to press for an EIR.
23 19. On July 13, 2018, a public hearing on the Project was held before Respondent
24 BOARD.
25 20. Petitioner and other members of the public submitted written comments and
26 testimony on the inadequacy of the MND; the need for an EIR; the failure of MNWD to comply
27 with provisions of the City of Laguna Hills General Plan and Zoning and Development Code
28

Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 and state law; and unmitigated Project impacts relating to light and glare, geology and soils,
2 hazards and hazardous materials, land use/planning, growth inducement and noise, among other
3 issues.
4 21. On or about July 13, 2018, MNWD filed and recorded a Notice of Determination
5 for the MND for the Project.
6 22. As a result of Respondents' approvals, Petitioner and its members will suffer
7 great and irreparable environmental harm as described herein. Respondents' errors and failures
8 to comply with CEQA, Planning and Zoning Law, the City of Laguna Hills General Plan and
Zoning and Development Code as described herein were prejudicial and Petitioner has suffered
10 substantial injury as a result of such errors. Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law for this
11 irreparable harm.
12 23. Petitioner has exhausted all administrative remedies by submitting written
13 comments and testimony to MNWD prior to Project approval, requesting compliance with
14 CEQA and the completion of full and adequate environmental review and compliance with all
15 relevant state and local laws. All issues raised in this petition were raised in a timely manner
16 before MNWD by Petitioner, other members of the public, experts or public agencies.
17 24. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code § 21167.5 by prior service of
18 a notice upon MNWD indicating its intent to file this petition. Proof of Service of this
19 notification, with the notification attached, is attached as Exhibit A.
20 25. This petition is timely filed in accordance with Pub. Res. Code § 21167, Code
21 § Civ. Proc. § 1094.6(b), Gov. Code § 65009(c) and 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15112.
22 26. MNWD has abused its discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by
23 law in the following ways:
24
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
25 Violation of CEQA (Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.)

26 Failure to Proceed in a Manner Required by Law
(By Petitioner Against Respondents MNWD)
27

28

6 Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 27. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth
2 above.
3 28. CEQA requires that a Lead Agency prepare a legally adequate EIR prior to
4 approving any discretionary project that may have a significant environmental effect. The EIR
5 must fully disclose and analyze the project's potentially significant environmental effects. The
6 Lead Agency is also required pursuant to CEQA to consider mitigation measures and alternatives
7 that would reduce or avoid the project's significant environmental effects; to adopt all feasible
8 mitigation measures and/or alternatives; and to determine that proposed mitigation measures will
9 or will not be effective in avoiding or substantially lessening the project's significant
10 environmental impacts.
11 29. CEQA requires that an EIR provide a complete and accurate description of both
12 the project and the project's environmental setting.
13 30. The EIR must provide sufficient environmental analysis such that decision-
14 makers can intelligently consider environmental consequences when acting on proposed projects.
15 Mitigation measures adopted for a project's significant environmental effects must be specific,
16 enforceable and not impermissibly deferred.
17 31. In approving the Project and certifying an EIR, CEQA requires that the Lead
18 Agency must find either (1) that the project's significant environmental effects have been
19 mitigated or avoided or (2) that the unmitigated impacts are outweighed by specific overriding
20 economic, legal, social, technological, or other benefits of the project. The Lead Agency may
21 reach the latter conclusion and adopt a Statement of Overriding Considerations only if it finds
22 that there are no feasible mitigation measures or alternatives to avoid or substantially lessen the
23 remaining significant environmental effects of the project.
24 32. As the Lead Agency, MNWD has a clear, present, and mandatory duty to analyze
25 and adopt all feasible mitigation measures as well as consider a reasonable range of alternatives
26 and adopt any feasible alternative that would substantially lessen the significant environmental
27 effects of the Project.
28

7 Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 33. Petitioner and other members of the public presented substantial evidence that
2 the Project may have significant unmitigated environmental impacts including but not limited
3 to impacts in the areas of light and glare, geology and soils, hazards and hazardous materials,
4 land use/planning, growth inducement and noise and that mitigation has been impermissibly
5 deferred.

6 34. An EIR is required when there is substantial evidence in the record that any
7 aspect of the project, either individually or cumulatively, may have a significant effect on the
8 environment regardless of whether the overall effect of the project is adverse or beneficial
9 (CEQA Guidelines §§ 15063 and 15064).
10 35. A negative declaration is inappropriate if it can be fairly argued that the
11 project will cause significant environmental impacts. "A trial court…reviews an agency's
12 decision to adopt a negative declaration using the fair argument test. Under this test, the
13 agency must prepare an EIR whenever substantial evidence in the record supports a fair
14 argument that a proposed project may have a significant effect on the environment.
15 [Citations.] If such evidence is found, it cannot be overcome by substantial evidence to the
16 contrary." "Under this standard, deference to the agency's determination is not appropriate
17 and its decision not to require an EIR can be upheld only when there is no credible evidence
18 to the contrary..." Baldwin v. City of Los Angeles (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 819, 841-842.
19 36. MNWD violated CEQA by failing to require an EIR for the Project when
20 Petitioner and members of the public submitted substantial evidence supporting a fair argument
21 that the Project may have significant effect on the environment, and by adopting and certifying
22 an MND for the Project that is inadequate and fails to comply with CEQA in the following ways,
23 among others.
24 Noise Impacts
25 37. Petitioner and members of the public presented substantial evidence that the
26 Project may have significant unmitigated noise impacts including increased objectionable levels
27 of noise rendering outdoor uses unviable for residents; interior noise levels interfering with sleep,
28

8 Petition for Writ of Mandate

watching television, talking on the phone etc.; inadequate noise reduction measures which will
2 not mitigate significant noise impacts to levels of insignificance; inappropriate and excessive
3 noise criterion and significance thresholds; and a demonstrated need for acoustical analysis,
4 monitoring and reporting.
5 Land Use/Planning Impacts
6 38. Petitioner and members of the public presented substantial evidence that the
7 Project may have significant unmitigated land use/planning and growth inducement impacts.
8 39. The MND acknowledges that the Project is inconsistent with the City of Laguna
9 Hills' Zoning and Development Code and will require a city-wide Zone Text Amendment
10 ("ZTA") and Zoning Variance. However, the MND fails to acknowledge that due to this
11 inconsistency, under CEQA, that Land Use/Planning is an environmental factor potentially
12 affected by the project. Likewise, section 4.10 of the MND is overtly misleading in indicating
13 "No Impact" under this impact category.
14 40. A land use inconsistency or conflict as identified in Appendix G to the CEQA
15 Guidelines is normally considered to have a significant effect on the environment. The MND
16 cannot avoid identifying in the initial study checklist or the body of the MND the patent conflict
17 by reliance on a potential ZTA or variance. Neither of these actions would be needed in the
18 absence of the patent conflict.
19 41. The CEQA mandated MND analysis is to identify the potential impact and then
20 examine how to avoid or mitigate the impact. The MND does neither. It simply proceeds with a
21 discussion of proposed zoning amendments necessary to facilitate the Project.
22 42. The Project site is a "Governmental use" within the City Community/Private
23 Institution zoning district classification. The City's zoning code concerning Governmental uses
24 requires a minimum of 25 % open space for properties with this land use designation (Table 9-
25 32.0404 of the Laguna Hills Municipal Code ("LHMC*).) The City also requires that the project
26 have 25% landscaped area. Taken together, the LHMC requires that 50% of a parcel with a
27

28

9 Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 Governmental use in a Community/Private Institution zoning district be open space and
2 landscaped area.
3 43. The MND acknowledges that the Project does not meet these requirements. While
4 the landscaped area, including the detention basin, constitutes 25.2% of the site, the remaining
5 areas, consisting of parking, materials storage, and the detention basin, do not meet the City's
6

7 definition of open space. The MND also double counts the detention basin in both the
landscaped area and the remaining area resulting in potentially inaccurate and inappropriate
8 percentage totals for landscaped area versus other areas.
9 44. The MND understates and minimizes the Project's patent land use inconsistency
10 by relying on open space areas which are not part of the Project site on the slopes to the north
11 and southeast of the site as well as the nearby Mandeville Park to the east. The presence of
12 adjacent open space demonstrates the incompatibility of the proposed overdevelopment and
13 intensification of use on the Project site and the Project's failure to be consistent with its
14 surroundings in failing to meet minimum open space requirements. Open space on other parcels
15 cannot be relied on to avoid the Project's non-compliance with City mandated open space
16 I requirements.
17 45. To resolve the patent inconsistency with the LHMC, the MND proposes to
18 request that the City, a responsible agency under CEQA, amend the code to "remove the 25%
19 open space requirement for Governmental uses through a ZTA". This ZTA would apply
20 throughout the City such that any property with a Governmental use would no longer be required
21 to maintain 25% of the parcel in open space. Petitioner is informed and believes that
22 approximately 12 properties in the City have the Governmental use classification and open space
23 requirements are applicable to these parcels in the City of Laguna Hills.
24 46. The MND must, but does not, identify the potential city-wide effects of such a
25 ZTA, including cumulative, growth-inducing effects on other similarly situated parcels. The
26 MND must, but does not, analyze growth inducing impacts likely to result from Governmental
27 uses no longer being required to have 50% of the parcel in open space and landscaped areas. An
28

10 Petition for Writ of Mandate

additional 25% of such parcels would now be subject to development or expansion of the sites in
2 question resulting in a multitude of potential significant impacts.
3 47. The City's rationale for requiring 50% landscape and open space for parcels with
4 Governmental uses should have been but was not identified and examined in the MND in order
5 for the ultimate decision-makers in the City as a responsible agency to determine the propriety of
6 the ZTA request and whether it fulfills the reasons behind the open space requirements or the
7 necessary showing or findings for a ZTA.
8 48. The City's General Plan sets forth a uniform and cohesive set of open space
9 protection policies which cannot be reconciled with the project's ZTA proposal to do away with
10 open space requirements.
11 49. The MND fails to analyze the proposed ZTA's and the Project's inconsistency
12 with the City's open space policies.
13 50. The proposed ZTA will require findings supported by substantial evidence by the
14 City (See LHMC 9-92.080 A.). The MND does not identify or analyze the Project in connection
15 with these requisite findings. The MND lacks evidence in support of the necessary findings or
16 an articulated basis for the ZTA consistent with the required findings.
17 51. The MND fails to analyze City wide cumulative impacts from proposed changes
18 to section 9-32.050 of the LHMC to allow Outdoor Storage facilities and section 9.32-0606 to
19 allow an 8 foot fence when proposed as part of Governmental uses.
20 52. The MND acknowledges that the Project will require a Conditional Use Permit
21 from the City. In order for the City to approve a Conditional Use Permit, City staff must
22 conclude that all necessary findings can be made for the project. As proposed, the MND lacks
23 substantial evidence in support of these findings. The Project is not presently consistent with the
24 zoning code; all required development standards prescribed by the LHMC cannot be achieved.
25 The site is not adequate in size and shape to accommodate the proposed use and integrate it with
26 existing [residential and open space] uses in the vicinity as it cannot include the requisite 50%
27 combination of open space and landscaped area.
28

11 Petition for Writ of Mandate

H 53.
2 The MND fails to provide adequate information, analysis and mitigation for the

3 identified Land Use/Planning impacts and is legally insufficient for the City to perform its duties

4 as a Responsible Agency to: (1) reach its own conclusions on whether to approve the ZTA, the

5 zoning variance and CUP for the Project; (2) find feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation

6 measures within its powers that would substantially lessen or avoid any significant effect the

7 Project would have on the environment (Guidelines § 15096(g)(2)); (3) deny the Project in order

8 to avoid direct or indirect environmental effects of that part of the Project which the Responsible

9 Agency would be called on to carry out or approve (Guidelines § 15042); (4) require preparation

10 of a subsequent/supplemental environmental document to fully analyze impacts of the land use

11 approvals proposed by the Project; and (5) make its own findings required under CEQA

12 supported by substantial evidence.

13 Geology and Soils/Hazard and Hazardous Materials Impacts
54.
14 Petitioner, experts and members of the public presented substantial evidence that

15 the Project may have geology and soils and hazards and hazardous materials impacts.
55.
16 The Geotechnical Investigation Reports and their accompanying logs contained

17 inconsistent information and measurements rendering conclusions unsupported.
56.
18 The Geotechnical Investigation Reports and the MND contain inconsistent

19 compliance indicia rendering their conclusions unsupported.

57.
20 The Geotechnical Investigation Reports fail to include warranted, necessary

21 liquefaction analysis.

58.
22 The Phase I Environmental Site Assessment ("ESA") and MND rely upon

23 database containing erroneous information. The ESA failed to consider readily available

24 documents regarding treatment and disposal of contaminated soil on the Project site. ESA

25 conclusions are unsupported.

59.
26 The Project site has a documented history of hazardous materials releases and use,

27 unauthorized releases from underground fuel storage tanks, notice of violation for volatile

28 organic compound emissions, Vapor Encroachment Condition beneath the site, contaminated

12 Petition for Writ of Mandate

H

2 soils, unknown, unidentified and unanalyzed volumes of sewage sludge and cesspool deposits,

3 shallow groundwater and current use of underground storage tanks with integrity issues.

60.
4 The MND and its technical reports fail to include adequate evaluation of

5 contamination conditions including baseline soil, soil gas and groundwater assessment that

6 include testing for all potential contaminants, including methyl tert-butyl ether ("MTBE") and

7 benzene vapor a and a sensitive receptor survey.
61.
8 Project grading and dust generated from soil disturbing activities may release

9 hazardous contaminated materials adversely affecting residents and construction personnel. The

10 MND fails to adequately analyze, identify or mitigate these impacts.

62.
11 The MND fails to identify, analyze and mitigate for all Recognized

12 Environmental Conditions at the site including sewage sludge and cesspool deposits on site since

1968.
13 63.
14 Significance conclusions concerning contaminants and hazardous materials are
unsupported and unsubstantiated.
15 64.
16 MND conclusions are based on an outdated, unauthorized hazardous release case

17 and conclusions reached therein, antiquated regulatory protocol and limited data, improper and

18 inadequate soil remediation and unassessed petroleum hydrocarbon contaminants. Impact and

19 mitigation conclusions in these areas are unsupported.

65.
20 Groundwater testing via test pits and exploratory borings during environmental

21 and geotechnical investigations were done during a protracted drought.

66.
22 Expert opinion indicates a potentially significant impact from proposed 10,000

23 gallon hazardous materials storage in addition to existing 10,000 gallon hazardous material

storage.
24 67.
25 The MND was not circulated to all potentially Responsible and Trustee Agencies

26 including but not limited to County of Orange Health Care Agency, Public Health Services,

27 Environmental Health Division, Hazardous Materials Mitigation Division.

28 Heat, Light, Glare and Aesthetic Impacts

13 Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 68. Petitioners and members of the public presented substantial evidence that the
2 Project may have significant unmitigated heat, light and glare impacts.
3 69. The MND fails to identify baseline condition of property and resulting increased
4 heat, light and glare impacts from altering large portions of the Project site from current dirt
5 surface to paved parking lot.
6 70. The MND's light and glare mitigation/project design requires that: "All lighting
7 would be hooded or shielded to focus the light downward and prevent light spillage onto
8 adjacent properties." However, the MND also inconsistently includes luminaires which are not
9 fully shielded and impacts remain significant and unmitigated.
10 71. The photometric lighting study is incomplete, is not legible for the public, experts
11 and decision makers to see or test its information and does not include off-site light trespass
12 calculations critical to its mitigation conclusions.
13 72. The MND fails to meet LHMC requirements concerning lighting measures.
14 73. The MND fails to include all reasonable mitigation measures for heat, light and
15 glare and other aesthetic impacts.
16 74. Under the foregoing circumstances, an EIR is required and contrary evidence is
17 not adequate to support the City's decision to dispense with an EIR.
18 Mitigation is Impermissibly Deferred
19 75. The MND impermissibly defers mitigation.
20 76. "Impermissible deferral of mitigation measures occurs when an EIR puts off
21 analysis or orders a report without either setting standards or demonstrating how the impact can
22 be mitigated in the manner described in the EIR." Clover Valley Foundation v. City of Rocklin
23 (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 200, 236.
24 77. "An EIR is inadequate if '[t]he success or failure of mitigation efforts ... may
25 largely depend upon management plans that have not yet been formulated, and have not been
26 subject to analysis and review within the EIR.™" Communities for a Better Environment v. City of
27 Richmond (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 70, 92, quoting San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Center v. County
28

14 Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 of Merced (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 645, 670. See also Laurel Heights (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376,
2 394 (when post-approval environmental review is allowed, EIRs become nothing more than post
3 hoc rationalizations to support action already taken"). These mitigation requirements are also
4 applicable to MNDs (Pub. Resources Code §21081.6).
5 78. Formulation of a comprehensive lighting plan and final photometric plan is
6 impermissibly deferred until after project approval and grading. See AES-2. The MND fails to
7 show that providing specific mitigation measures is impractical or infeasible. Preserve Wild
8 Santee v. City of Santee (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 260, 280 ("Preserve Wild Santee").
9 79. The MND impermissibly defers analysis of potential impacts to jurisdictional
10 resources until after project approval. Consultation with responsible/trustee agencies (RWQCB
11 and CDFW) is deferred until after project approval. Analysis of potential impacts is likewise
12 deferred as is formulation of any mitigation. See BIO-1.
13 80. The MND impermissibly defers analysis and pre-demolition surveys for asbestos,
14 lead-based paints and PCBs until after project approval. See HAZ-1. These materials threaten
15 human health and have potential to impact surrounding residents if improperly removed or
16 disposed of. Their presence should be identified in the MND so the public has an opportunity to
17 review and comment upon removal, handling and disposal before project approval. The MND
18 fails to identify why it is impractical or infeasible to conduct sampling and analysis of the
19 structures to be demolished prior to project approval.
20 81. Mitigation measur HAZ-2 impermissibly defers analysis and formulation of a
21 Soil Management Plan and Health and Safety Plan.
22 82. The stated goal of the Soil Management Plan is to minimize risks to owners,
23 developers and human health and the environment by providing a pre-approved plan for
24 disturbing known or suspected contaminated areas at a site. Pre-project approval preparation of
25 this plan and public vetting is critical in view of the proximity of sensitive receptor residences to
26 the Project site, the errors identified in the database used in the ESA, identified inconsistencies
27 between the Geotechnical Investigation Reports and their accompanying logs, inconsistencies
28

15 Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 between the Geotechnical Investigation Reports and the MND, the Geotechnical Investigation's
2 failure to perform liquefaction analysis, the documented history of hazardous materials releases
3 and use on the Project site, the inadequacy of the outdated, unauthorized release case and
4 conclusions reached therein, antiquated regulatory protocol and limited data and unassessed
5 petroleum hydrocarbon, sewage sludge and cesspool contaminants present on site. Under
6 CEQA, this plan should be part of the MND, subject to public participation and comment and not
7 deferred until after project approval.
8 83. The Health and Safety Plan describes the process for identifying the physical and
health hazards that could harm workers, procedures to prevent accidents and steps to take when
10 accidents occur. Pre-project approval preparation of this plan and public vetting is critical in
11 view of the proximity of sensitive receptor residences to the Project site, the errors identified in
12 the database used in the ESA, identified inconsistencies between the Geotechnical Investigation
13 Reports and their accompanying logs, inconsistencies between the Geotechnical Investigation
14 Reports and the MND, the Geotechnical Investigation's failure to perform liquefaction analysis,
15 the documented history of hazardous materials releases and use on the Project site, the
16 inadequacy of the outdated, unauthorized release case and conclusions reached therein,
17 antiquated regulatory protocol and limited data and unassessed petroleum hydrocarbon, sewage
18 sludge and cesspool contaminants present on site. Under CEQA, this plan should be part of the
19 MND, subject to public participation and comment and not deferred until after project approval.
20 The MND is Inadequate as an Informational Document
21 84. The MND and MNWD's processing of same fail to comply with CEQA
22 requirements and informational policies in the following respects: use of an improper baseline in
23 identifying biological and aesthetic impacts by using the post-drained condition of the on-site
24 pond habitat; failure to properly and fully identify and analyze aesthetic impacts; failure to
25 identify feasible alternatives, including an alternate site or conduct alternatives analysis; failure
26 to properly analyze and mitigate significant light and glare, geology and soils, hazards and
27

28

16 Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 hazardous materials, land use/planning, growth inducement and noise impacts; and failure to
2 provide adequate Responses to Comments,
3 81. MNWD has failed to proceed as required by CEQA in multiple respects and its
4 approvals of the Project must be set aside.
5
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
6 Violation of CEQA (Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.)

7 Findings Are Not Supported By Substantial Evidence (By Petitioner Against Respondents MNWD)
8

9 82. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference cach and every allegation set forth

10 above.

11 83. No substantial evidence supports MNWD's findings adopted pursuant to CEQA,

12 including the findings that the Project's impacts have been mitigated to less than significant

13 levels.

14 84. As a result of the failure to identify, analyze and mitigate significant Project

15 impacts, findings under CEQA are not supported in impact areas of light and glare, geology and

16 soils, hazards and hazardous materials, land use/planning, growth inducement and noise and

17 findings regarding the adequacy of the MND and mitigation thereunder are not supported.

18 85. Findings in connection with the MND, incorporation by reference of the MND

19 and referencing the MND's conclusions do not provide requisite review or consideration of or

20 findings on the MND, are not supported by substantial evidence, are incomplete and are not

21 compliant with CEQA or City of Laguna Hills Municipal (Zoning and Development) Code

22 provisions.

23 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

25 For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate, commanding Respondents MNWD and
