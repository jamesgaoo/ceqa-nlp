25 Civil Procedure section 446, Petitioner and Plaintiff CITY OF HAYWARD alleges as follows:

26 INTRODUCTION

27 1. Petitioner City of Hayward ("City") brings this Petition for Writ of Mandate and

28 Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief in the public interest directed to the

82452.00002\30620045.2 - 1 -

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY and the BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE

2 CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY (collectively referred to as "CSU"). City challenges

3 CSU's January 31, 2018 approval of the Campus Master Plan for California State University,
4 East Bay and CSU's certification of the Partial Recirculated Final EIR ("PRFEIR") for the Master

5 Plan Revision (including the Pioneer Heights Phase IV dormitory project, collectively with the

6 Master Plan Revision referred to herein as the "Project"). CSU approved the Project and certified
7 the PRFEIR in violation of the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act
8 ("CEQA") (Public Resources Code §§ 21000 et seq.).

9 2. The California State University, East Bay ("University" or "CSUEB") main
10 campus is located within the City of Hayward. The City provides fire and other emergency

11 services for the University and its students, faculty, staff, and visitors. The City has a direct and

12 beneficial interest in the University due to, among other reasons, the City's provision of services
13 to the University. An addition to the campus of students, faculty, and staff would create impacts

14 to the City and its residents, including increasing traffic.

15 3. The PRFEIR, however, does not adequately analyze the impact of the additional

16 CSUEB population on the City's parks and uses flawed analytical tools to determine that the

17 Project would not have a significant effect on parkland. The PRFEIR also did not reanalyze the
18 proposed mitigation measures for traffic impacts. Rather, the CSU Board of Trustees decided to
19 contribute approximately $2.3 million to off-campus traffic impacts and to agree to enter into a
20 Memorandum of Understanding with the City despite the fact that the City and the University
21 have agreed to neither the specific mitigation amount nor the specific improvements to be funded
22 by CSU. This action was premature and does not constitute feasible mitigation under CEQA.
23 PARTIES

24 4. City is a duly incorporated charter city in the County of Alameda. The City and its
25 residents have a direct and beneficial interest in the University's plans for future growth on and
26 around the campus within the City limits. The City and its residents have an interest in the

27 protection and preservation of the environment. The City is responsible for regulating land use
28 within its borders and is charged with protecting the public health and safety and promoting the
82452.00002\30620045.2 - 2-

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATOR Y AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

general welfare and quality of life of its residents.

2 5. City has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law within

3 the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure section 1086, in that CSU's approvals of the Project and
4 its PRFEIR is not otherwise reviewable in a manner that provides an adequate remedy.
5 6. City has performed any and all conditions precedent to the filing of this Petition
6 and Complaint, has participated in all phases of the administrative and environmental review

7 processes, and has fully exhausted its administrative remedies.

8 7. California State University East Bay is one of 23 California State University
9 campuses and is governed by Respondent and Defendant Board of Trustees of the California

10 State University.

11 8. Respondents and Defendant Board of Trustees is the board that governs the CSU

12 system. The CSU Board has full powers of organization and governance over the CSUEB campus
13 and, therefore, has the principal responsibility for approving the Project.

14 9. Respondent and Defendant California State University is a public agency of the
15 State of California and owns and operates the California State University system.

16 10. Respondent and Defendant CSU is the Lead Agency responsible under CEQA for
17 evaluating the environmental impacts of the Master Plan with final approval and certification of
18 the PRFEIR resting with the CSU Board of Trustees.

19 11. CSU has taken final agency actions with respect to adopting and certifying the
20 PRFEIR and approving the Project. CSU a has a mandatory duty to comply with applicable state
21 and federal laws, including, but not limited to, CEQA, prior to undertaking the discretionary
22 approvals at issue in this lawsuit.

23 12. The true names and capacities of Respondents and Defendants Does 1-10,
24 inclusive, are unknown to City, who sued said Respondents by such fictitious names pursuant to
25 Code of Civil Procedure section 474. City will seek leave of Court to amend this petition and

26 complaint when the true names and capacities have been ascertained.

27 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

28 13. City brings this action as a petition for writ of mandate pursuant to Code of Civil
82452.00002\30620045.2 - 3 -
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, as a complaint for injunctive relief pursuant to Code of Civil

2 Procedure section 526 et seq., and as a complaint for declaratory a relief pursuant to Code of Civil

3 Procedure section 1060.

4 14. Venue is proper in Alameda County pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure

5 section 395.

6 FACTS

A 0 15. The University's main campus is in Hayward, which is the focus of the
University's Master Plan.

9 16. The University's Master Plan process began in 2006. The Master Plan outlines all

10 aspects of the physical development and planned land uses to support the Hayward campus'

11 enrollment and academic goals through 2030. The Master Plan assumes the campus would have

12 18,000 full time equivalent students, or approximately 25,000 individual students, as well as

13 additional faculty and staff.

14 17. The University published the Draft EIR in November 2008, and the Trustees

15 certified the Final EIR in September 2009. The City and two other interested parties challenged

16 the adequacy of the Final EIR (Alameda County Superior Court Case No. RG09-480852).

17 18. The City's primary concern in that lawsuit was that the Hayward Fire Department

18 provides fire and emergency response service to the CSU campus but that the EIR did not find the

19 need for 11 additional firefighters to be a significant impact on the environment. Accordingly,
20 CSU concluded it did not have to mitigate that impact. The trial court agreed with the City, but

21 the First District Court of Appeal reversed the trial court, concluding that the obligation to

22 provide additional fire protection services was the City's responsibility.

23 19. The EIR also concluded that the Master Plan would result in significant impacts to

24 off-campus intersections, and the University estimated its fair share cost to mitigate those impacts

25 at approximately $2.3 million. However, the CSU Trustees adopted a resolution directing the

26 University's chancellor to request the needed funds from the Governor and Legislature. But

27 because that funding could not be guaranteed, the Trustees also concluded that given the

28 uncertain funding, it could not actually guarantee mitigation. Thus, the Trustees concluded that
82452.00002\30620045.2 , 4 .

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATOR Y AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

the off-site traffic impacts were significant, could not be adequately mitigated given the uncertain

2 funding, and that overriding considerations justified adopting the EIR for the Master Plan despite

3 the lack of mitigation. The City argued that the Trustees could not simply ask the Governor and
4 Legislature for additional funds and that CEQA required actual mitigation, not mitigation

5 dependent on funding from the Legislature. The First District Court of Appeal initially ruled in

6 favor of CSU on this issue as well.

7 20. The City sought California Supreme Court review, which was granted. The

8 California Supreme Court held the case pending its decision in City of San Diego V. Board of

9 Trustees of California State University, 61 Cal. 4th 945 (2015), which also involved CSU's

10 position that mitigation for off-campus impacts was only feasible if the Legislature provided

11 funding. The Supreme Court disagreed with CSU and concluded that CEQA does not condition

12 the duty of a state agency to mitigate environmental effects on the Legislature's appropriation of

13 funds for such mitigation. The Court emphasized that CEQA requires each public agency in the

14 State of California to mitigate or avoid significant environmental effects from its projects

15 whenever it is feasible to do so.

16 21. Following the City of San Diego decision, the California Supreme Court remanded

17 the Hayward case to the First District Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal then received

18 additional briefs. CSU stated in its brief that it was working on ensuring that CSU projects would

19 be consistent with the Supreme Court's San Diego decision.

•20 22. The Court of Appeal issued a new opinion, City of Hayward v. Trustees of the

21 California State University, 242 Cal. App. 4th 833 (2015). The court ruled that the FEIR did not

22 consider the specific impacts of the Master Plan's growth on two neighboring parks and did not

23 provide factual support to support CSU's statement that new students would make the same use

24 of the parks as existing students.

25 23. The First District noted that the City of San Diego case provided additional clarity

26 regarding the feasibility of funding off-site mitigation. The Court appeared to take CSU at its

27 word that it would comply with the City of San Diego case and stated at page 857 that "in view of

28 the clarification provided by City of San Diego and the scope and public importance of the project
|l 82452.00002\30620045.2 - 5 -

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 in question, it is appropriate for the Trustees to heed the Supreme Court's guidance with respect

2 to this project.. 66 Thus, the Trustees were required to revise some of the analysis in the FEIR

3 before approving the Master Plan project and certifying the EIR in its entirety.

4 24. In March of 2017, CSU issued its Partial Recirculated Draft Environmental Impact

5 Report ("PRDEIR") for the Cal State East Bay Hayward Campus Master Plan, including the

6 Pioneer Heights Phase IV Student Housing project. The PRDEIR presented a revised parklands

7 impact analysis, which again did not show a significant impact on the environment. CSU

8 requested that any comments be limited to the parkland topic addressed in the PRDEIR. Nowhere
9 in the PRDEIR did CSU address mitigation for off-campus impacts consistent with the San Diego

10 decision.

11 25. The City submitted written comments on the PRDEIR to CSU on May 11, 2017.

12 The City noted the absence of analysis regarding the off-campus environmental impacts. The City

13 asked that the PRDEIR be revised to include such information and that the PRDEIR be

14 recirculated for additional public review and comment. The City also requested that should CSU

15 choose instead to address the issue only in a resolution adopting the PRFEIR, that an actual

16 analysis be completed and provided in that resolution. The City also requested receiving a copy of

17 any findings in advance of the Trustees' consideration of them.

18 26. The City also commented in its May 2017 letter that the parkland analysis was

19 inadequate in that it did it not properly analyze the use of parks by additional students anticipated to

20 use the parks. In particular, the City noted that the study analyzed park usage at times when it

21 would be unlikely that students would actually be using the park, such as on a Sunday morning.

22 27. CSU released the Partial Recirculated Final EIR in January 2018. In response to

23 the City's comment regarding traffic mitigation, CSU responded that the City's request exceeds

24 the scope of the courts' orders and that the only remaining issue was the feasibility of funding for

25 the campus' fair share contributions for off-campus intersection improvements. The response also

26 stated that the Trustees would consider its conclusions regarding feasibility of funding in new

27 findings (presumably to be adopted in a resolution or similar document) rather than in the

28 PRFEIR or other environmental document.

82452.00002\30620045.2 - 6 -

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

28. The PRFEIR also responded to the City's comments regarding parks and stated

2 that the surveys were conducted during times when CSU believed that there would be more
students on campus.

4 29. CSU scheduled approval of the PRFEIR and the Master Plan for January 31, 2018.

5 The report prepared for this item stated that the Court of Appeal upheld the Trustees' calculation

6 of CSU's calculation for traffic mitigation at off-site intersections. This statement is untrue as the

7 Court of Appeal noted that while the University had calculated its fair share contribution at

8 approximately $2.3 million, CSU had engaged in lengthy and unsuccessful negotiations with the

9 City "to calculate the estimated mitigation expenses." Thus, the amount needed to adequately

10 mitigate off-campus traffic impacts has not been resolved or agreed to when the issue was

11 considered by the courts and remains unresolved. The City does not agree with the value assigned

12 to the mitigation.

13 30. On January 30, 2018, the City sent a letter to CSU regarding the PRFEIR. The

14 City responded to CSU's response to its comment letter that CSU's fair share contribution for

15 off-site traffic mitigations remains unresolved. The City also noted that CSU did not provide any

16 supporting documentation regarding the valuation of the mitigation or explain how any values

17 were assigned to a particular mitigation measure. In short, none of the environmental documents

18 prepared by CSU included a calculation or analysis that supported the amount CSU claimed had

19 been upheld by the courts.

20 31. The City also noted in its comments that it has been working with the campus to

21 resolve the valuation issue but that a final agreement had not been reached. CSU stated in its

22 report that a part of the approval process involved entering into a Memorandum of Understanding

23 ("MOU"). But the parties had not yet agreed to any terms, so it was not possible to enter into such

24 an agreement. Further, the City noted that even if the City had agreed that the valuation number

25 used by CSU was correct, CSU first proposed the number in 2009 and had never adjusted it for

26 inflation. Quite simply, CSU has been using the same figure since 2009 and in almost 10 years

27 never adjusted it upward for inflation or rising construction costs. The City stated that

28 continuation of the item would be appropriate as approval would be premature as the City and
82452.00002\30620045.2 - 7-

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATOR Y AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

CSU had not resolved a key issue of the value of CSU's off-site mitigation.

2 32. On January 31, 2018, the Board of Trustees set aside and vacated its September
2009 approval of the Master Plan, decertified the 2009 Final Environmental Impact Report,
4 certified the Final Environmental Impact Report prepared in 2009 as modified by the PRFEIR,
5 approved the Master Plan, and approved funding for future off-site fair share mitigation in the
6 amount of $2,331,618, the same amount initially proposed by CSU in 2009.
33. CSU filed a Notice of Determination on February 1, 2018 with the State
8 Clearinghouse.

34. The City has fully exhausted all of its administrative remedies to the extent

10 required by law. City and others have submitted comments on the Project and the PRDEIR and

11 raised the legal deficiencies asserted in this Petition prior to CSU's final action on the PRFEIR

12 and Project.

13 35. On February 28, 2018, City sent to CSU by email and U.S. mail a letter stating the

14 City planned to file the Petition and complaint seeking to invalidate CSU'S certification of the
15 PRFEIR and approving the Project. With this action, City complied with Public Resources Code

16 section 21167.5. A copy of that notice with proof of service is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

17 36. City provided the Attorney General of the State of California with a notice and

18 copy of the Petition and Complaint in compliance with Public Resources Code section 21167.6

19 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388. A copy of the notice to the Attorney General is attached

20 hereto as Exhibit B.

21 37. City has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.6 by concurrently

22 filing a request for preparation of the administrative record relating to this action.
23 38. This petition is timely. The applicable statute of limitations for filing a CEQA
24 petition is 30 days from the filing of a Notice of Determination. City is informed and believes that

25 the Notice of Determination was filed with the State of California Governor's Office of Planning

26 and Research on February 1, 2018.

L FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2

3 39. Peremptory Writ of Mandate Against Respondents

4 City realleges and incorporates the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through
38 of this Petition as if fully set forth herein.

5 40.

6 CSU's actions in approving and certifying the PRFEIR, reapproving the Master

7 Plan, making findings under CEQA, and adopting a statement of overriding considerations

8 constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion in that CSU failed to proceed in the manner required
by law and/or its decisions were not supported by substantial evidence,

9 forth herein below. as more particularly set

10 41.

11 An Environmental Impact Report identifies the significant effects a proposed

12 project may have on the environment and identifies the feasible mitigation measures that could
avoid or substantially lessen those environmental effects.

13 42.

14 The initial FEIR concluded that the Project would create traffic impacts. It also

15 stated that the City and University should work together on the mitigation. Neither the initial

16 FEIR nor the PRFEIR obligate CSU to pay for its fair share of traffic improvements.
43.

17 In the report prepared for the January 31, 2018 Trustees' meeting, CSU noted that

18 the process of determining the impacted intersections and improvements began with holding

19 meetings with the City and CSU agreeing to contribute its fair share cost for the intersections and

20 improvements. This process would ultimately be documented in an MOU between the City and

21 CSU. The Board of Trustees had previously determined that its fair share obligation was
$2,331,618.

22 44.

23 CSU notes in its report that the City and CSU have been unable to agree on the

24 MOU's terms despite holding meetings regarding both the amount and process for CSU's

25 payments for off-site traffic mitigation measures. Instead, the Board of Trustees appears to have

26 adopted a process regarding CSU's off-campus mitigation requirements whereby CSU will

27 deposit the approximately $2 million into a restricted account, and the funds would be released to

28 the City when the City is ready to proceed with the traffic improvement. That process would also
be documented in a MOU.

82452,00002\30620045.2 - 9-

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 45. According to CSU, this mitigation process for off-campus traffic improvement

2 purportedly satisfied the requirements of Mitigation Measures TRANS-1a and TRANS-5 in the

3 initial FEIR. Mitigation Measure TRANS-1a requires CSU to prepare a comprehensive
t Transportation Demand Management (TDM) Plan to plan for, fund, implement, and monitor the

5 effectiveness in the Master Plan TDM section. TRANS-5 states that the City should review traffic

6 and circulation networks within the City "and prepare a deficiency plan to address further

7 projected deficiencies" and that CSU would "cooperate with the City in developing measures to

8 address future deficiencies, including the measures" set forth in Mitigation Measure TRANS-1.

9 46. These two mitigation measures do not obligate CSU to mitigate the traffic impacts

10 to the greatest extent feasible. They do not commit CSU to fund the mitigation measures in an

11 amount that will actually mitigate environmental impacts. Neither measure was updated or

12 otherwise amended in the PRDEIR in response to the ongoing litigation and the San Diego case.
13 47. Instead, CSU chose to rely on an almost ten-year old figure and to include in its
14 resolution adopting the Project that it would enter into an MOU with the City despite the fact that,

15 by its own admission, CSU had not yet even come to an agreement with the City about the

16 fundamental terms of an MOU. The resolution does not allow the mitigation funding to be

17 adjusted in the future if additional funds are needed. It does not provide any information

18 regarding whether CSU's funding obligation for off-campus mitigation will continue until all of

19 the mitigation measures have been implemented. Rather, it a sets a ceiling for the amount of funds

20 CSU will contribute with no explanation for how or whether the funds actually correspond to

21 traffic improvements or projects.

22 48. CSU's mitigation measures remain illusory and lack specificity. CSU has not

23 demonstrated that it will be able to mitigate any of the off-campus traffic impacts its Project will

24 cause.

25 49. In addition to its illusory mitigation measures, the parkland analysis in the

26 PRFEIR remains flawed. It does not properly analyze the impact on parkland that would be

27 caused by the additional students, including by the additional 600 students who would be housed

28 on campus.
82452.00002\30620045.2 10 -

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 50. CSU's studies of park usage in 2012 and 2014 also examined park usage during

2 times when it was likely that fewer students and other members of the campus community would

3 be using the parks. For example, no survey evaluated park usage during the evening hours. The

4 PRDEIR should have had a complete and accurate analysis of park impacts and must be redrafted

5 and recirculated for additional review and comment under CEQA.

6 51. For these reasons, CSU failed to a proceed in a manner required by law and abused

7 its discretion by adopting the Project and recertifying the EIR and certifying the PRFEIR.

8 WHEREFORE, City prays for judgment as hereinafter set forth.

9 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

10 Declaratory Relief Against Respondents

11 52. City realleges and incorporates by reference each of the allegations of paragraphs

12 through 51 as if fully set forth herein full.

13 53. An actual controversy exists between the parties in that City contends that CSU

14 has violated CEQA and must vacate its certification of the PRFEIR and prepare, circulate, and

15 consider a legally adequate EIR. A judicial resolution of this controversy is necessary and

16 appropriate.

17 WHEREFORE, City prays for judgment as hereinafter set forth.

18 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

19 Injunctive Relief Against Respondents

20 54. City realleges and incorporates by reference each of the allegations of paragraphs

21 through 53 as if fully set forth herein full.

22 55. City has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law. Unless enjoined, CSU will

23 implement the Project and proceed with its illusory mitigation measure despite its lack of

24 compliance with CEQA and the San Diego decision. City will suffer irreparable harm by CSU's

25 failure to take the required steps to adequately protect the environment.
