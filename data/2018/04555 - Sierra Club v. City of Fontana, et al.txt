28 (CEQA) challenging the approval by the City of Fontana ("City") of the Southwest

-1-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Fontana Logistics Center Project ("the Project"). The Petition For Writ of Mandate is
2 transmitted herewith.

3 The Project would develop an industrial warehouse logistics complex totaling
4 approximately 1.6 million square feet in predominately residential area of the City of

5 Fontana and immediately south of a high school. The buildings will operate as high

6 cube warehouse logistics centers, meaning that diesel trucks will bring cargo to the

7 Project buildings for storage and sorting for transport on other trucks to destinations in

8 and outside California. These operations will occur 24 hours per day, seven days per
9 week. The City anticipates that the Project will generate nearly 3,000 diesel truck trips
10 |per day.

11 The Environmental Impact Report ("'EIR") fails to comply with CEQA in a
12 number of meaningful ways including that there is insufficient support for the EIR's
13 conclusions with respect to air quality, energy, greenhouse gas, land use, and noise

14 impacts. Furthermore, the City failed to adopt patently feasible mitigation to lessen
15 significant impacts, and the City failed to adopt alternatives that would substantially
16 lessen impacts to adjacent single-family residential and school uses.

17 For these and the other reasons alleged in the Verified Petition for Peremptory
18 Writ of Mandate, the decision approving the Project must be overturned.

24 INTRODUCTION

25 1. This action challenges the approval by Respondent,

26 or about January 23, 2018, City of Fontana ("City"), on

27 of the Southwest Fontana Logistics Center project, including certification of a Final Environmental

28 2018-004), General Plan Amendment No. Impact Report (Resolution No.

Zone Change No. 16-003 (Ordinance No. 1771), Specific Plan Amendment No.
N m t 16-002 (Ordinance No. 1772), Tentative Parcel Map No. 19711, Design Review
Project No. 15-017 (Resolution No. 2018-006), Development Agreement No.
16-005 (Ordinance No. 1773), and all related land use approvals (collectively,

5 "the Project").
6 2. The Southwest Fontana Logistics Center project concerns the development of
7 two industrial warehouse buildings totaling approximately 1.6 million square

8 feet on 73.3 acres of vacant and semi-improved land in the City of Fontana. The
9 buildings will operate as high cube warehouse logistics centers, meaning that
10 diesel trucks will bring cargo to the buildings for storage and sorting for
11 transport on other trucks to destinations in and outside California. These
12 operations will occur 24 hours per day, seven days per week. The Project's
~† Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") anticipates that the Project will generate
5,938 daily vehicle trips including 2,319 diesel truck trips. The Project site is
15 surrounded by existing residential uses-in fact, two single-family homes will
16 be located within 15 feet of Project operations. In addition, a school - Citrus
17 High School - is located to the immediate north of the site. Yet the admittedly
18 adverse and significant impacts associated with the Project have not been

19 adequately evaluated and/or mitigated in violation of the California

20 Environmental Quality ("CEQA") (Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.).
21 3. The City of Fontana's certification of the Final EIR for the Project must be

22 vacated because the record lacks substantial evidence in support of the EIR's
23 conclusions, and because the EIR fails to adequately describe or disclose
24 relevant information. Also, the EIR concludes that the Project results in
25 significant and unavoidable impacts but the City failed to adopt all feasible

26 mitigation and adopted mitigation is ineffective to reduce significant impacts.
27 Additionally, the City failed to evaluate a reasonable alternative to the proposed
28

-2-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Project and improperly rejected alternatives that would lessen or avoid some of
2 the Project's harmful effects.
3 4. During the Project's administrative review process, interested parties notified the
4 City that there was need for further analysis and mitigation due to the Project's
5 adverse effects including that the City should consider additional mitigation
6 measures for significant air quality and greenhouse gas emission impacts as well
7 as alternatives to the proposed project. In spite of these reasoned comments in

8 the record, the City approved the Project and certified the EIR.
9 5. By this verified petition, Petitioner alleges the following:
10 PARTIES
11 6. Petitioner, SIERRA CLUB, is a national environmental organization of 829,913
12 members, of which 182,402 members reside in California. The San Gorgonio
13 Chapter of the Sierra Club encompasses San Bernardino County and has
14 membership of 7,439 individuals. Sierra Club's goals include protecting
15 California's lands, waters, air and wildlife. Local members of the San Gorgonio
16 Chapter of the Sierra Club reside in the general vicinity of the Project site and
17 are concerned with the Project's impacts to the local and regional environment.
18 Sierra Club submitted comments opposing approval of the Project to the County.
19 7. Respondent, CITY OF FONTANA, is a political subdivision of the State of
20 California. The City is a local governmental agency charged with the authority
21 of regulating and administering local land use and development within its
22 territory in compliance with the provisions of its general plan and zoning
23 ordinances as well as applicable provisions of State law, including CEQA. The
24 City is the lead agency for the Project and is therefore charged with the duty of
25 ensuring compliance with applicable State and local laws.

- 8. Real Party in Interest, GLC FONTANA II LLC, is identified in the record as the
2 applicant for the Project, has an ownership interest in the property, and/or claims
40o A U an interest in the Project approvals at the subject of this lawsuit.
9. DOES 1 through 100 are individuals or entities that may have an ownership
interest in the property, were project applicants, or claim an interest in the
approvals at the subject of this lawsuit. Petitioner is unaware of the true names

7 or capacities of the Real Parties in Interest identified herein under the fictitious

8 names DOES 1 through 100 inclusive.

9 STATEMENT OF FACTS

10 The Project

11 10. The Southwest Fontana Logistics Center project is a proposal for the

12 construction and operation of two industrial warehouse logistics buildings,
13 totaling 1,628,936 square feet, on 73.3 vacant and semi-improved acres in the

14 southern area of the City of Fontana.

15 11. The Project site is bounded by Santa Ana Avenue to the north, Jurupa Avenue to
16 the south, and Cyprus Avenue to the east.

17 12. The Project will function as logistics facilities for warehousing, distribution, and

18 goods-movement.

19 13. The Project's Building 1 will occupy the northern portion of the site along Santa

20 Ana Avenue and consist of approximately 540,564 square feet of warehouse use
21 and 20,000 square feet of office use. Building 2 will occupy the southern portion
22 of the site and consist of approximately 1,048,372 square feet of warehouse use
23 and 20,000 square feet of office use. Buildings 1 and 2 may be up to 60 feet in
24 height per the Project's site plan.

25 14. The Project includes tentative parcel map to consolidate 22 separate parcels
26 into two separate parcels for the two proposed warehouse buildings. The

27 Project's map excludes two, contiguous residential properties that are located at

28

-4-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 the northwest corner of Jurupa and Cypress Avenue. These homes will be
2 located within 15 feet of Project operations. The Project's Building 2 will
3 operate 76 truck loading docks in immediate proximity to these existing
4 residences.

5 15. The Project site is otherwise surrounded by a residential community to the south;
6 undeveloped land, a church and residential properties to the east; residential
7 properties to the west, and a high school (Citrus High School) and low density
8 residential uses to the north.
9 16. The Project's Building 1 will operate 39 truck loading docks in immediate
10 proximity of the low density residential uses as well as Citrus High School, in
11 particular the school's outdoor recreational/sports fields. Also, heavy duty
12 trucks will access the Project site (Building 1) from Santa Ana Avenue, adjacent
13 to these homes and the high school.
14 17. The Project includes a General Plan Amendment to amend the City of Fontana
15 General Plan land use map from Residential Planning Community (R-PC) to
16 General Industrial (I-G) and a Zoning Change from Residential Planned

17 Community (R-PC) to Southwest Industrial Park Specific Plan (SWIP).
18 18. The Project purports to include a "future public (City) park" on a non-contiguous
19 17.45 site on the eastern side of Cypress Avenue. The EIR includes the park in
20 the description of the proposed project and claims that the park is evaluated by
21 the EIR on a "programmatic level".

22 CEQA Review and Project Approval

23 19. The City circulated a Notice of Preparation of Draft Environmental Impact
24 Report pursuant to CEQA on September 23, 2016.
25 20. The Draft EIR was circulated for public comment on September 5, 2017.

26 21. The Project's Final EIR was completed on or about November 21, 2017.
27 22.0n November 7, 2017, December 5, 2017, and December 19, 2017, the City

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

vo to A W N Planning Commission held public hearings on the Project. At the public hearing
on December 19, 2017, the Planning Commission voted to approve the Project
including a Resolution recommending approval of the Project including
certification of the Final EIR to the City Council.
23. On January 23, 2018, the City Council held a public hearing on the Project and

7 voted 3-1-1 to approve the Project including certification of the Final EIR, and

8 adoption of a Statement of Overriding Considerations and CEQA Findings of
Fact.

9

10 24. The Final EIR concludes that the Project will result in significant and
unavoidable environmental impacts with respect to air quality, greenhouse gas

12 emissions, noise and traffic.

13 25. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the CEQA Notice

14 of Determination was posted on January 24, 2018.

15 26. The City's approval of the Project will cause Petitioner irreparable injury

16 for which Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law. Petitioner and its members

17 will be irreparably harmed by the City's actions in approving the Project, among

18 other things, the failure of the City in its certification of the EIR to adequately

19 evaluate the potential impacts of the Project, and the City's approval of the

20 Project without providing adequate and effective mitigation measures contrary to
the requirements of State law.
21

22 27. The maintenance of this action is for the purpose of enforcing important public

23 policies of the State of California with respect to the protection of the

24 environment under CEQA and conformance with state law and local law. The

25 maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a substantial benefit upon

26 the public by protecting the public from environmental and other harms alleged

27 in this Petition. Petitioner is acting a as a private attorney general to enforce these
public policies and prevent such harm.

28

-6-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- JURISDICTION AND VENUE
N mto o 28. This Court has jurisdiction to issue writs of mandate under Code of Civil
Procedure Section 1094.5.
29. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
Sections 393 and 394 as the Project is located in, and the relevant events
occurred in, San Bernardino County.

7 30. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing the action by
8 complying with the requirements of Public Resources Code § 21167.5, in
9 notifying Respondent of the filing of this action (attached hereto as Exhibit "A"),
10 and by complying with the requirements of Public Resources Code § 21167.6, in
11 notifying Respondent of Petitioner's election to prepare the record of
12 Respondent proceedings in connection with this action (attached hereto as
13 Exhibit "B").

14 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

15 31. During the EIR's administrative review process, and at the public hearings on
16 the Project, members of Petitioner commented orally and in writing that the
17 Project would result in potentially significant impacts to/from including, but not
18 limited to: air quality, energy, greenhouse gases, land use, noise, traffic and
19 others. Members of Petitioner commented that the EIR was legally inadequate;
20 that further mitigation was required; and that project alternatives were feasible.
21 32. As a result of these comments in the record, Petitioner exhausted its
22 administrative remedies within the meaning of Cal. Public Resources Code §
23 21177.
24 CAUSE OF ACTION
25 (Writ of Mandate)
26 (All parties did not comply with the requirements of CEQA.)

27

28

-7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

,- 6 t n 33. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 32 above as
though set forth in full herein.
34. The California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") (Public Resources Code §
21100 et seq.), enacted in 1971, requires government agencies to consider the
environmental consequences of their actions before approving projects subject to

6 CEQA's provisions.

7 35. The Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") is considered "the heart" of CEQA.

8 To effectuate the Legislature's goals of environmental protection, CEQA
9 provides that an adequate EIR must evaluate all potentially significant
10 environmental impacts of a proposed project including both direct and indirect
11 impacts as well as cumulative impacts. State CEQA Guidelines "Guidelines",

12 002 15126, 15126.2 (a), 15130.
13 36. An EIR must also accurately describe the project it analyzes. Guidelines §
14 15124. An inaccurate or incomplete project description undermines CEQA's

15 purposes, particularly where it minimizes the project's environmental impacts.

16 "An accurate, stable, and finite project description is the sine qua non of an

17 informative and legally sufficient EIR." County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles

18 (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 192-93.

agency to 19 37. CEQA further establishes a substantive mandate on the part of the lead

20 mitigate the significant environmental impacts of a project. Public Resources
21 Code §§ 21002, 21002.1; Guidelines, § 15021 (a). A lead agency may not
22 approve a project for which there are significant environmental impacts unless
23 the agency makes findings that: (a) mitigation measures have been required of

24 the project which avoid or substantially lessen the significant environmental

25 impacts, or (b) mitigation measures are found to be infeasible based on

26 substantial evidence. Public Resources Code §§ 21081, 21081.5; Guidelines, §§

27 15091 (a)(b), 15092 (b).

28

-8-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

P 38. CEQA additionally provides that adopted mitigation measures must be certain

2 and enforceable. Public Resources Code § 21081.6(b); Guidelines, §

3 15126.6(a)(2). The lead agency must ensure that mitigation measures are
4 required by or incorporated into the project to ensure that the measures are
5 actually carried out. Public Resources Code § 21081.6 (a), (b).
6 39. CEQA's finally mandates that the lead agency evaluate alternatives to the

7 proposed project, or the location of the project, which would attain most of the

8 basic objectives of the project but would avoid or substantially lessen any of the
9 project's significant environmental effects. Guidelines § 15126.6 (a). The lead

10 agency has a duty to adopt a project alternative if it is feasible. Public Resources

11 Code § 21002. A lead agency may not reject an alternative unless the agency
12 makes findings supported by substantial evidence showing that the alternative is

13 infeasible. Public Resources Code §§ 21081, 21081.5; Guidelines §§ 15091 (a)
14 (3), 15092.

15 40. Petitioner and others commented that the EIR's Project Description was

16 inadequate as a matter of law because the EIR describes the Project as including

17 a 17.45-acre park, when a park is not actually a component of the proposed

18 Project. The City Council Staff Report acknowledges that "no specific

19 improvements for facilities are proposed for the park at this time," and the

20 "application does not include the development or layout of the park." Moreover,
21 the Project Description is confusing where the EIR purports to evaluate the

22 proposed Project on a project-level basis and the park on a

23 "programmatic" basis.

24 41. Petitioner and others commented that the EIR failed to adequately evaluate

25 impacts to/from including, but not limited to, air quality, energy, greenhouse gas

26 emissions, land use, noise, and traffic. By way of example, Petitioner and others

27 commented that:

28

-9-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

I a) The EIR's analysis of the Project's energy impacts is inadequate in terms
2 of State CEQA Guidelines, Appendix F. The City failed to require
3 sufficient analysis of the Project's energy consumption, transportation
4 energy impacts, and to demonstrate that the Project is taking steps to
5 reduce dependency on fossil fuels. For instance, the City failed to
6 evaluate or demonstrate how the Project "increases reliance on renewable

7 energy sources." Moreover, the City failed to adopt feasible mitigation
measures relative to energy impacts such as requiring that the Project
9 utilize any solar energy.
10 b) Contrary to the EIR's conclusions, there are significant land use impacts
11 due to the Project's conflicts with the City's General Plan including
12 policies relative to noise protections for residential uses and energy
13 conservation.

14 c) The EIR concludes that noise impacts during construction and operational
15 phases are less than significant, but this is not demonstrated based on

16 substantial evidence in the record. For instance, the EIR's noise analysis
17 indicates that construction noise levels are well above ambient conditions

18 at the nearest homes to the Project site; accordingly, the Project results in
19 "a substantial temporary increase in ambient noise conditions," i.e., the

20 Project exceeds an adopted threshold of significance.
21 42. Petitioner and others commented that not all feasible mitigation was required of
22 this Project, and Petitioner and others proposed feasible mitigation that has not
23 been shown to be infeasible based on substantial evidence in the record.

24 a) For instance, Petitioner proposed mitigation with respect to the Project's
25 significant air quality (NOx) impacts, such as requiring that the Project
26 incorporate the phase-in of electric, hybrid electric, hydrogen electric, or
27 battery operated (i.e., non diesel) trucks. In addition, Petitioner
28

-10-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

repeatedly urged the City to require that the Project be conditioned such
N m t n a that only 2010 model year trucks have permission to access the Project
site. The City declined to adopt these and other feasible mitigation
measures to address significant air quality as well as greenhouse gas
emission impacts, and the City failed to make findings supported by
substantial evidence that the measures are infeasible.

7 b) Also for instance, Petitioner commented that the Project should be limited

8 to the assumptions of the air quality study in terms of truck trips (number
9 and trip length) in order to ensure that significant impacts (NOx) are not
10 more severe than assumed by the EIR. Again the City declined to adopt
feasible mitigation to address significant impacts, and the City failed to
12 make findings supported by substantial evidence that the measure is c? infeasible.
14 c) Again for instance, Petitioner commented that the Project shall be
15 required to install solar panels sufficient to achieve "net zero", i.e., handle
16 the peak energy demands of the Project, or at a minimum require that the

17 Project construct and utilize solar energy infrastructure for some
18 reasonable portion of the Project's energy needs. The City declined to
19 adopt feasible mitigation to address significant impacts, and the City

20 failed to make findings supported by substantial evidence that the
21 measure is infeasible.

22 43. Petitioner and others commented that proposed mitigation measures were

23 uncertain, unenforceable, ineffective and/or deferred in violation of CEQA. By

24 way of example, Petitioner commented that the mitigation measure stating that
25 the Project "shall encourage all fleet vehicles to conform to 2010 air quality
26 standards or better" is inadequate. As written, this measure is entirely
27

28

-11-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

4N mv permissive in violation of CEQA's requirement that mitigation measures shall be
fully enforceable.
44. Petitioner and others commented that the EIR fails to adequately consider
alternatives to the proposed project, consistent with the mandate of Guidelines §
15126.6 (a). By way of example, the EIR discusses a development option-
o "Option A"- which would develop an optional site plan with 1,272,150 square

7 feet in a single warehouse building with a 17.35-acre park just north of the

8 warehouse development. Option A would substantially reduce the Project's
9 adverse environmental effects in particular relative to the residential and school
10 uses to the north of the Project site. Also, it is known that Option A would result
11 in 22% fewer vehicle trips than the proposed Project. Yet the EIR. does not
12 evaluate Option A as an alternative to the proposed project in violation of
13 CEQA. Furthermore, the City did not make findings that Option A is infeasible
14 based on substantial evidence in the record, contrary to CEQA.
15 45.For these reasons, the City violated CEQA and the Project approvals must be set
16 aside. Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1085, 1094.5; Public Resources Code § 21168.
PRAYER FOR RELIEF 17

18 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays the following relief on all causes of action:
19 a) For the Court's peremptory writ of mandate requiring Respondent, City of
