00 N O UT A CD Petitioners, Westwood History and Architecture Association and Steven D. Sann,
allege:

Introduction
1. By this action, Petitioners, Westwood History and Architecture Association and
Steven D. Sann, challenge the unlawful actions of the Regents of the University of
California (the Regents) and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA;

10 collectively, the University) in approving an enormous dormitory expansion

11 plan on the UCLA campus. That plan is described in Amendment #6 of the

12 UCLA 2002 Long Range Development Plan for Additional On-Campus Student

13 Housing, also known as the Long Range Development Plan Amendment (2017)

14 and Student Housing Projects (the Project). It includes amendments to the

15 existing long-range development plan to allow an additional 1,500,000 gross

16 square feet of developable space for student housing, and proposes student-

17 housing developments on five sites in different land-use zones of the UCLA

18 campus, with a total projected 6,900 new student-housing beds in approximately
1,715,000 gross square feet of new building space.

19 2.

20 The Project includes a new dormitory building on a site close to the landmark

21 Fox Westwood Village Theater (the Theater), a renowned and significant

22 historical resource in Westwood Village and a City of Los Angeles Historic-

23 Cultural Monument. The Project's impacts on Westwood Village and the Fox

24 Theater include negatively affecting focal views of the Theater, whose tower has

25 been the iconic symbol of Westwood since 1931, and the views of the historic

26 skyline of Westwood Village against the Santa Monica Mountains.

27
28 3. The Project will adversely affect cultural and aesthetic resources in the vicinity of

29 the UCLA campus, in violation of the California Environmental Quality Act

30 (CEQA). The environmental analysis for the Project also improperly and

31 inadequately considered Project alternatives, in further violation of CEQA.

.32 4. The Environmental Impact Report the University prepared for the Project is a

33 subsequent EIR to an EIR prepared in 2009 which, in turn, is a subsequent EIR to

34 an EIR prepared in support of the 2002 long range development plan. Several

35 initial studies and mitigated negative declarations were prepared for amendments
to the 2009 long range development plan. Mitigation measures were required by

1-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

most or all of these CEQA documents, most of which remain in effect. All of
2 these CEQA environmental documents are applicable now, and together
3 constitute the University's analysis of its development plans, with the result that
4 the overall CEQA documentation of the current plan violates CEQA by being
5 confusing and difficult for the public and the decision-makers to understand.
6

7 5. The deficiencies in the environmental analysis for the Project require that the

8 Project's environmental impact report and approval be set aside.

10

11 Parties

12 6. Petitioner Westwood History and Architecture Association (WHAA) is an
13 unincorporated association whose purpose is to advocate for protection,
14 conservation, preservation, and appreciation of important historical and
15 architectural resources in the Westwood area of Los Angeles, California.
16 WHAA's members include individuals residing and working in the vicinity of the
17 Project, and individuals interested in Westwood area history and architecture,
18 who would be detrimentally affected by the Project's impacts. WHAA brings this
19 action on its own behalf and on behalf of the public. Members of WHAA reside
20 in, work in, or often visit Westwood and therefore have a strong beneficial
21 interest in protecting the historical, cultural, and architectural resources in
22 Westwood, and in this case because the actions being taken by UCLA and the
23 Regents, and challenged in this case, affect them directly as neighbors of the
24 Project and members of the public at large.
25

26 7. Petitioner Steven D. Sann is a member of WHAA and a longtime member of the

27 Westwood-Holmby Historical Society. He has lived, worked, and studied in

28 Westwood for more than four decades, and is a recognized historic-preservation

29 advocate, author, and expert. He has contributed to published works on the

30 historic architecture and history of Westwood and Westwood Village. Mr. Sann

31 has strong beneficial interest in protecting the historical resources in

32 Westwood, and in this case because the actions being taken by UCLA and the

33 Regents, and challenged in this case, affect him directly and detrimentally as a

34 resident of Westwood and as a member of WHAA. Mr. Sann submitted

N comments during the Project's environmental review process and testified at the
public hearing on the Project.

8. Respondent Board of Regents of the University of California (Regents) is a
corporation established by the California Constitution and empowered to

1O 0 N administer the several campuses of the University of California system, including
UCLA.

9. Respondent University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) is a public entity

10 created under the laws of the State of California, and a campus of the University
of California.
11
12
13 10. Petitioners are currently unaware of the true names and capacities of respondents

14 and defendants Does 1 through 10, and therefore sues those parties by such

15 fictitious names. Does 1 through 10 are agents of Respondent Regents or of

16 Respondent UCLA who are responsible in some manner for the conduct

A92S described in this petition, or other persons or entities who claim some legal or
equitable interest in the subject matter of this action. Petitioners will amend this
petition to show the true names and capacities of Does 1 through 10 when such

20 names and capacities become known.

21
22 Jurisdiction and Venue

23
24 11. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this petition under Code

25 of Civil Procedure (CCP) $$1085 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code
§ 21167.
26
27 12. This case is properly classified as an unlimited civil case, and therefore within the

28 jurisdiction of this Court, because it is not one of the types of cases listed as

29 limited civil cases in CCP S$ 86, 86.1, or 87.

30
31 13. Venue is proper in this Court under CCP $ 393 because the Respondents are

32 public officers, and the causes of action arose in Los Angeles County, which is

33 where the Project's environmental effects will be felt.

34 14. Petitioners have performed all conditions precedent to filing this action,

35 including exhaustion of all available administrative remedies.

2 General Allegations

G.
4 15. UCLA has proposed to develop additional on-campus student housing at five

5 separate sites. Campus planning is conducted by means of long-range

6 development plans. Because the existing long-range development plan did not

7 include the proposed housing development, UCLA has undertaken an

8 amendment to that plan to add 1,500,000 gross square feet (gsf) of student

9 housing. The proposed Project consists of the proposed housing developments

10 and the associated proposed amendment to the existing long range development
plan.

11
12
13 Long-Range Development Plan and Environmental Impact Report

14 16. UCLA prepared updated Long Range Development Plans (LRDPs) in 1983 and
1990. It also prepared an environmental impact report (EIR) for each of those
LRDPs.
15

16
17 17. UCLA first developed the currently operative Long Range Development Plan

18 (LRDP) in 2002 (the 2002 LRDP).

19

20 18. An LRDP is meant to be a comprehensive land-use plan that guides physical

21 development of the UCLA campus. The 2002 LRDP aimed to plan for increased

22 enrollment beyond projections included in the prior LRDP, adopted in 1990 (the

23 1990 LRDP). Because of the projected enrollment increases, UCLA planned to

24 address increased demand for student housing through the Student Housing

25 Master Plan, dated March 2001. The 2002 LRDP did not increase proposed new

26 development beyond the amount of unused development capacity remaining
from the 1990 LRDP (1.71 million gsf).

27

28 19. An environmental impact report was prepared for the 2002 LRDP (the 2002

29 LRDP EIR). The 2002 LRDP EIR is a program-level environmental assessment

30 that describes the effect of implementation of the entire 2002 LRDP.

31

32 20. The 2002 LRDP contemplated that future development proposals would undergo
environmental analysis tiered from the 2002 LRDP EIR.

33
34 21. The 2002 LRDP was amended multiple times. Amendment #1 to the 2002 LRDP

35 updated the campus population projections by extending the LRDP horizon year
from 2010-2011 to 2013. It also increased the total development allocation from

. 4 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1.71 million gsf in the 2002 LRDP to 1.87 million square feet. That amendment to
N the 2002 LRDP resulted in what UCLA terms the Existing LRDP.
22. UCLA completed an environmental impact report in relation to that
amendment, titled the UCLA 2008 Northwest Housing Infill Project and Long
Range Development Plan Amendment Final Environmental Impact Report DN 00 (March 2009 LRDP Amendment Final EIR).

23. Four later amendments to the LRDP transferred allocations of square footage
between campus land-use zones. For each of these amendments, UCLA
10 completed an initial study and a negative declaration or mitigated negative
= declaration.
12 13 24. In 2017, UCLA initiated a process to amend the 2002 LRDP a sixth time, to add
14 1,500,000 gsf for housing developments.
15 25. In August 2017, UCLA released a Draft Subsequent Environmental Impact
16 Report for the UCLA Long Range Development Plan Amendment (2017) and
17 g Student Housing Projects (2017 LRDP Amendment DSEIR or DSEIR)
According to the DSEIR, it tiers from the March 2009 LRDP Amendment Final 19 EIR.
20
21 26, In January 2018, UCLA completed and issued a Final Subsequent Environmental

22 Impact Report for the UCLA Long Range Development Plan Amendment (2017)

23 and Student Housing Projects (2017 LRDP Amendment FSEIR or FSEIR). The
2017 LRDP Amendment DSEIR and 2017 LRDP Amendment FSEIR together 24
25 comprise the UCLA Long Range Development Plan Amendment (2017) and

26 Student Housing Projects Subsequent Environmental Impact Report (2017
LRDP Amendment SEIR or SEIR). 27
28 27. The mitigation measures in the Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program
29 adopted with the March 2009 LRDP Amendment Final EIR apply to the Project,
30 with some modifications. Project-specific mitigation measures have also been
31 developed for the Project.
32
33 28. The SEIR concluded that even with implementation of mitigation measures,

34 significant and unavoidable impacts would result from the Project, requiring a
Statement of Overriding Considerations. These impacts include but are not 35

5-

limited to historical resources impacts (demolition of Warren Hall), air quality
2 impacts, and construction-related noise and traffic impacts.
3
4 Proposed Student Housing Development Under the Project
5 29. UCLA proposed to develop on-campus student housing on five sites: the
6 University Extension (UNEX), Lot 15, Warren Hall, Bradley, and Drake Stadium
7 sites. UCLA has identified a potential to develop up to 6,900 beds on those sites.
8
9 30. The 2017 LRDP Amendment DSEIR identified the maximum number of beds at

10 each site and the square footage, height, and massing of potential structures at

11 those sites. After the DSEIR was completed, schematic designs for the proposed
12 developments at the UNEX, Lot 15, and Warren sites were prepared, each
13 representing a reduction in gross square feet and bed count compared to the
14 amounts identified in the DSEIR.

15 31. The UNEX site is located at the corner of Le Conte Avenue and Gayley Avenue.
16 The site is within the "Bridge" campus land-use zone, in the southern area of the
17 UCLA campus. The Bridge zone is a narrow ribbon of land, situated between the
18 residential neighborhood to the northwest, the main UCLA campus to the
19 northeast, the UCLA West campus to the west, and Westwood Village to the
20 south. The UNEX site is occupied is by the UNEX building, which houses the
21 UCLA University Extension Program, and a parking lot, The UNEX site falls
22 within the City of Los Angeles Northwest Specific Plan area, which limits the
23 height of buildings to 45 feet. The UNEX site is also adjacent to the Westwood
24 Village Specific Plan area, which has a height limit of 40 feet. The existing UNEX
25 building, which was constructed in 1971 and is 98,304 gsf, would be demolished.
26
27 32. The proposed housing project at the UNEX site is often referred to is as the 10995

28 Le Conte Apartments.

29 33. The originally proposed housing development on the UNEX site would
30 accommodate up to 1,350 student-housing beds in a building of 350,000 gsf, with
31 9 and 20 levels (medium- and high-rise, respectively).
32

33 34. After modification of the proposed development, the Project now proposes

34 constructing a 302,000 gsf apartment building with approximately 190 units of

35

- 6 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

OONOMAMN on-campus apartment-style housing and 1,159 student housing beds. The
previously proposed 20-level building has been reduced to 17 levels (stories).

35. The Lot 15 site is in the campus's Northwest Zone. The site was used for parking
in the past. Existing structures onsite include the Ornamental Horticultural
buildings. Existing buildings at the site would be demolished.
36. As part of the Project, the site was originally proposed to be developed to provide
up to 1,800 beds in two buildings of 8 to 10 levels, with a total of approximately

10 353,000 gsf. This development would require modification of the 1978 Stipulated

11 Agreement of Compromise and Order resolving litigation filed against the

12 Regents by the Westwood Hills Property Owners Association, which limits uses

13 in the area of the Northwest Zone including the Lot 15 Site to "benign uses."

14
15 37. After modification of the proposed development at the Lot 15 site, the Project

16 proposes to construct a total of 343,600 gsf with 1,781 beds in two buildings of 8
levels.

17
18 38. The Warren Hall site is in the campus's Southwest Zone at 900 Weyburn Place

19 North. The site is currently occupied by Warren Hall, housing office uses and

20 research facilities, the Hillblom Islet Research Center, and surface parking. These

21 buildings would be demolished.

22
23 39. Warren Hall was constructed in 1961 and is 102,205 gsf. The building is eligible

24 for listing in the National Register of Historic Places and California Register of
Historical Resources.

25
26 40. As identified in the DSEIR, the Project proposed to develop three mid-rise

27 buildings of 8 and 10 levels at the Warren Hall Site, with a total of up to 2,350

28 beds and 650,000 gsf. After modification, the FSEIR identified the proposed

29 development as up to 2,350 beds and 591,100 gsf.

30
31 41. The proposed housing project at the Warren Hall site is often referred to as the
Southwest Campus Apartments.

32
33 42. The Bradley site is in the campus's Northwest Zone and is undeveloped. It is

34 surrounded by on-campus uses to the north, east, and south, and off-campus

35 residential uses to the west. The Project would include development of two mid-

- 7 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

OONOAMI rise buildings of 7 and 8 levels on the site, with approximately 122,000 gsf and up
to 600 beds.

43. The Drake Stadium site is in the Central zone of the campus. The stadium is used
for soccer and track-and-field teams. Drake Stadium was constructed in 1969 and
is 12,260 gsf. The proposed housing structure would be developed in the area
over and surrounding the existing concourse. It would accommodate up to 800
beds in a mid-rise building of up to 9 levels and approximately 240,000 gsf. The

10 middle third of the building is "cut away" and reduced to two stories in height.

11 This "cut away" section is designed to preserve the historic and iconic views

12 across the UCLA campus, including historic Royce Hall, Powell Library, and
Janss Steps, when viewed from the west, and to

13 the UCLA campus. respect the scale and character of

14
15 Westwood Village and Fox Westwood Village Theater

16

17 44. The area around the Bridge zone, in which the UNEX site is located, includes on-
campus and off-campus uses. There are residential uses to the north and west,

18
19 part of the UCLA campus to the east, and the Westwood Village commercial area
to the south.

20

21 45. The skyline of the Westwood Village commercial area, which lies directly south

22 of the UNEX site, is characterized by low- and mid-rise buildings meeting the

23 Westwood Village Specific Plan general height limit of 45 feet.

24 46. The Westwood Village skyline is dominated by the Fox Westwood Village

25

26 Theater, a 1931 Spanish Colonial Revival movie theater, located approximately
one block southeast of the UNEX site. The Fox Theater features an iconic 170-

27 foot-tall tower, which is a tapered cylindrical shape topped by a spire and

28

29 illuminated "Fox" sign. The 2017 LRDP Amendment FSEIR recognized that the
Theater tower "is a distinctive, character-defining feature of the historic

30 building."

31

32 47. The Fox Theater is an internationally recognized symbol of Westwood Village.

33 The cultural, architectural, and historical significance of the Theater is directly

34 tied to the history and development of Westwood Village. The Fox Theater's

35 tower is a prominent and highly significant feature in views of Westwood Village.

8 -

+2y

1 Many iconic views of Westwood Village show the tower against the backdrop of
2 the Santa Monica Mountains and the sky.
3
4 48. The Fox Theater was declared City of Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument

5 #362 in 1988, and has been found eligible for listing on both the California

6 Register of Historic Resources and the National Register of Historic Places.

7 49. The existing mid-rise UNEX Building, approximately 120 feet in height, does not
8 obscure or feature prominently in views in which the Theater's tower are a
9 prominent feature. When viewed from the entrance of Westwood Village, at the
10 intersection of Wilshire Boulevard and Westwood Boulevard, the existing UNEX
11 building was designed to sit just below the mountain ridge skyline of the Santa
12 Monica Mountains. The UNEX Building is increasingly less prominent or not
13 visible from many vantage points. For example, it is minimally visible from the
14 epicenter of Westwood Village, at the intersection of Weyburn Avenue and
15 Brockton Avenue.
16

17 50. The proposed 17-story dormitory for the UNEX site would be significantly taller

18 than buildings in its vicinity, and would obscure landmark views and focal views

19 of the Fox Theatre tower. It would be incompatible with surrounding buildings

20 and completely out of proportion for its location. Its size will destroy the skyline

21 in Westwood Village, where the Fox Westwood Village Theater is the most

22 prominent and iconic landmark on the skyline. The new building at the UNEX

23 site will obscure landmark views of the Theater tower.

24 Project Approval Process
25
26 51. UCLA held a public hearing for the UCLA LRDP Amendment and Student

27 Housing Projects DSEIR on September 26, 2017. More than 33 individuals spoke

28 at the public hearing, including Petitioner Steven D. Sann.

29 52. On January 25, 2018, the Regents held a public meeting at which it certified the
30 2017 LRDP Amendment SEIR, and adopted the CEQA Findings, Statement of
31 Overriding Considerations and Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Plan
32 (collectively, the CEQA Approvals). The Regents approved Amendment #6 to
33 the UCLA 2002 LRDP, and approved budget, external financing, and design for
34 Lot 15 Residence Hall, 10995 Le Conte Apartments (the new development on the
35

UNEX site), and Southwest Campus Apartments (the new development on the
2 Warren Hall site).
3

4 53. On January 30, 2018, the University of California submitted to the Office of

5 Planning and Research four Notices of Determination for the UCLA Long Range

6 Development Plan Amendment (2017) and Housing Projects, with the following

7 alternate titles: (1) Amendment #6 to the UCLA 2002 Long Range Development

17 First Cause of Action

18 Violation of CEQA

19 54. WHAA incorporates 99 1-53 as though set forth here.
20

21 55, In certifying the SEIR, the University violated the California Environmental

22 Quality Act, Public Resources Code $$ 21000-21189.3 (CEQA) and the CEQA

23 Guidelines (14 Cal. Code Regs. $5 15000-15387 plus appendices) in significant

24 ways, some of which are described in the following paragraphs.

25 56. The University has failed to disclose, analyze, and mitigate the Project's
26 significant impacts to aesthetic and cultural resources.
27
28 57. Where mitigation measures are included, they are vague, deferred, or inadequate

29 to truly mitigate the Project's impacts.

30 58. The analysis of Project alternatives is deficient and in violation of CEQA.
31
32 59. The University has failed to prepare a legally adequate SEIR because the SEIR

33 tiers from or is based on, or related to, several other Environmental Impact

34 Reports and Mitigated Negative Declarations going back to 2002, most of which

35 apply directly or indirectly to the Project. It is difficult for the public or the

N decision-makers to synthesize the current state of analysis and mitigation from

document. this number of documents, causing the SEIR to fail in its role as an informational

Aesthetic Impacts

O 0 - 10 60. The proposed development at the UNEX site, increasing from the current

11 building's 8-story height to a 17 stories and approximately 170 feet in height, will

to its visual quality.

33 degrade the visual environment of the area and cause significant adverse impacts

13
14 61. The proposed development would be incompatible with surrounding buildings

15 and completely out of proportion for its location. The UNEX development is too

16 tall, too dense, and too imposing in relation to the neighboring community. It

17
N8c will dwarf neighboring properties and overshadow the community. Its building
mass and form is wholly out of character with neighboring sites.
62. An increase in height from 8 stories to 17 stories for the proposed dormitory on
the UNEX site would be massively disruptive to the existing skyline, as seen from

22 many vantage points around Westwood. As acknowledged in the DSEIR, the new

23 building would become: focal point of the viewshed, permanently destroying

24 existing views in the vicinity. The building would mar the historic viewshed of

25 the Westwood Village skyline as set against the Santa Monica Mountains, rising
significantly above the skyline of the Santa Monica Mountains.

26 63. Its height, bulk, massing, and size would destroy the skyline in Westwood

28 Village, and obliterate many "focal views" of the 170-foot tower of the landmark

29
30 Fox Westwood Village Theater, the most prominent and iconic landmark on the
skyline. The new development would destroy this focal view as seen from

31 prominent southerly points including the intersection of Wilshire and Westwood

32 Boulevards. A high-rise building in this location will become the most dominant

33 and prominent building on the skyline from several important vantage points,

34 and would permanently damage the historic Westwood Village skyline when
viewed against the Santa Monica Mountains.

64. The Fox Westwood Village Theater, built in 1931, is a renowned historical
2 resource in Westwood Village. Views of the Theater, a Historic Cultural
3 Monument, will be significantly and negatively impacted.
4

5 65. The University failed to adequately analyze aesthetic impacts, in part because it

6 wrongly determined Public Resources Code $ 21099(d) applies, despite the

7 statutory limitation on the scope of $ 21099(d) contained in $ 21099(e) with

8 respect to impacts on historical and cultural resources. The SEIR analysis

9 inappropriately compares the proposed 17-story UNEX dormitory tower to

10 buildings located at a great distance from the UNEX site, rather than comparing

11 its height to buildings located in the vicinity. The Regents have adopted CEQA

12 Guidelines for aesthetic impacts under which the Project's impacts are

13 significant.

14 66. The 2017 LRDP Amendment SEIR failed to properly analyze the potentially
15 significant impacts to aesthetic resources, including those enumerated above, 16 thereby violating CEQA.
17
18 67. The University's conclusion that the proposed housing project at the UNEX site
19 would not have any significant visual or aesthetic impacts, including as related to

20 historical resources, is utterly unsupported by adequate analysis. For instance, the
21 SEIR improperly restricted its analysis to questions listed in Appendix G to the

22 CEQA Guidelines, although potential impacts that are not listed in the appendix

23 must also be considered under CEQA. Additionally, the analysis of scenic vistas
24 was improperly limited to on-campus focal views and improperly relied on the

25 March 2009 LRDP Amendment Final EIR.

26 68. There is no substantial evidence in the record to support the University's finding 27 that aesthetic impacts from the Project would be less than significant, and there is
28 no substantial evidence to support the finding that no mitigation is required for
29 aesthetic impacts.
30

31 69. The University failed to adequately respond to comments raising concerns about

32 impacts on visual and aesthetic impacts.

33 70. The Project's aesthetic impacts are significant, and cannot be mitigated into
34 insignificance without further redesign, so the SEIR must be set aside.

Cultural Resources
2 71. The Project will have significant, unmitigated adverse effects on cultural
3 resources, including the Fox Westwood Village Theater.
4

5 72. The proposed development at the UNEX site, increasing from the current

6 building's 8-story height to 17 stories and approximately 170 feet in height, will

7 cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of the Fox Westwood

8 Village Theater, a historical resource under CEQA Guidelines $ 15064.5. The

9 impacts of the development include that it will alter the immediate surroundings

10 of the Theater, resulting in material impairment of its significance.
11 73. The University failed to properly analyze the potentially significant impacts to
12 historical resources, including those enumerated above, thereby violating CEQA.
13
14 74. The University's conclusion that the proposed housing project at the UNEX site

15 would not materially impair the integrity of the Fox Westwood Village Theater is

16 unsupported by adequate analysis or substantial evidence.
17 75. There is no substantial evidence in the record to support the University's finding
18 that impacts to historical and cultural resources from the Project, including
19 development at the UNEX site, would be less than significant, and there is no
20 substantial evidence to support the finding that no mitigation is required for such
21 impacts.
22
23 76. The University failed to adequately respond to comments raising concerns about
24 impacts on cultural impacts.

25 77. The Project's impacts on cultural resources are significant, and cannot be
26
27 mitigated into insignificance without a redesign, so the SEIR must be set aside.

28 Public Services

29 78. The SEIR failed to properly analyze the impacts of the Project on emergency
30 vehicular access to the emergency room of the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical
31 Center, given the high degree of traffic congestion already present at the Medical
32 Center.

2 Analysis of Project Alternatives

3

4 79. During the public comment period on the DSEIR, comments were submitted

5 requesting the University to consider an alternative for the Project that would

6 reduce the height, massing, and bed count of the new development at the UNEX

7 site by approximately 50 percent, redistributing the beds eliminated at that site to

00 the Warren Hall, Bradley, and/or Drake Stadium sites. The proposed alternative

9 would result in a mid-rise tower at the UNEX site that would be consistent with

10 the predominant height, scale, and character of the Westwood Village Specific

11 Plan area and the North Westwood Village Specific Plan area.

12 80. In the 2017 LRDP Amendment FSEIR, UCLA responded by referring to sections

13 of the FSEIR discussing the current design for the UNEX site, noting the

14
15 recommendation would be forwarded for consideration by decisionmakers, and
stating, "significant and unavoidable impacts resulting from the proposed

16 housing project at the UNEX site are cumulative in nature or related to

17
18 construction activities that would occur with development at the UNEX site in
combination with other sites and would not be avoided if the UNEX site were

19 developed with a smaller building and remaining beds distributed to other sites.

20
21 Therefore, any such alternative would not avoid or eliminate the project impacts identified in the Draft SEIR and further analysis of this suggested alternative is
not required."
22
23
24 81. The SEIR failed to present a reasonable range of alternatives, including by failing

25 to consider an alternative such as the one proposed during the public comment
period.

26
27 82. The SEIR's alternatives analysis should have included an alternative with a

28 reduced-height dormitory building on the UNEX site, with redesign of

29 development at other sites to compensate for the reduced beds at that site. It

30 should have also considered an alternative utilizing the site directly across the

31 street from the UNEX site at the corner of Gayley and LeConte Avenues. Such

32 alternatives would have avoided or substantially lessened significant

33

34 environmental impacts of the Project while attaining most of the Project's basic
objectives. Significant impacts that could have been avoided or substantially

35 lessened include impacts to aesthetic and cultural resources.

2 83. The FSEIR's response to comments proposing a reduced-height alternative

3 design for the UNEX site was inadequate, including in that it failed to

4 acknowledge the significant environmental impacts of the Project that could have

5 been avoided or substantially lessened by adopting the proposed alternative.

6 SEIR Fails as an Informational Document

7
8 84. The UCLA Long Range Development Plan, issued originally in 2002, has become

9 a confusing hodge-podge, with 5 amendments and a panoply of related

10 environmental documentation. The Environmental Impact Report for this

11 project tiers from the EIR for the 2009 LRDP amendment which itself tiers from

12 the 2002 LRDP Amendment EIR. Several Mitigated Negative Declarations for

13 LRDP amendments tier off the EIRs adding analysis and mitigation measures to

14 the mix. Figuring out what the EIRs and MNDs say on a particular issue requires

15 consulting several documents and determining how they relate with respect to

16 that issue. That makes it difficult for the public and decision-makers to

17 understand the EIR for this Project, so they can provide intelligent input and

18 make an informed decision. The SEIR therefore violates CEQA by failing to serve

19 as the "meaningful and useful" document required by Pub. Res. Code § 21103(b).

Re: Westwood History and Architecture Association v. Board of Regents of the University of
California Case # BS172479

To the Attorney General of the State of California:
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that on February 28, 2018, this firm, on behalf of its client, Westwood History and Architecture Association, filed a petition for writ of mandate against the Regents of the University of California in Los Angeles County Superior Court. This letter provides the notice of that
lawsuit required by Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388.
The petition alleges that the Regents violated the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code 6$ 21000 et seq. (CEQA) by approving a project with substantial adverse effects on the environment without the environmental review required by CEQA. The project at issue is an
enormous dormitory expansion plan on the UCLA campus.
A copy of the petition is included with this notice.
