22 By this verified petition, Petitioner and Plaintiff Discovery Builders ("Discovery,"
23 "Plaintiff," or "Petitioner") alleges as follows:
24

25 INTRODUCTION

1. Discovery seeks a declaration by this Court that Respondent and
26 Defendant City of Antioch ("City") must fully comply with the requirements of the
27 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Pub. Resources Code §§ 21000 et seq.,

14270179.3 28 in connection with its review and approval of the Wildflower Station Project, and the City
VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 must complete a CEQA-compliant, public environmental review process before approving
2 the Wildflower Station Project.

2. The City improperly piecemealed the environmental impact analysis for the
4 Wildflower Station Project into at least three segments: the Wildflower Station Project, the

5 General Plan Land Use Element Update ("Land Use Element Update"), and the
6 Downtown Specific Plan. These projects must be evaluated together due to the linkage
7 between them. CEQA mandates that activities that are integral parts of the same project
8 be analyzed and evaluated together to ensure environmental impacts are properly
9 identified and considered. (Tuolumne County Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. V.
10 City of Sonora (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 1214, 1228.)

11 3. Further, the City abused its discretion by certifying the Wildflower Station
12 Project Initial Study 1 Mitigated Negative Declaration ("Wildflower Station IS/MND"),
13 because there is substantial evidence that the IS/MND will result in new significant
14 impacts to the environment that were not identified, analyzed, or mitigated in the IS/MND.

15 4. The City also abused its discretion and failed to proceed in a manner
16 required by law because the City did not adequately respond to Discovery's comments to
17 the Wildflower Station IS/MND, in violation of CEQA public participation and information
18 disclosure provisions.

19 5. The City improperly prepared and certified the Wildflower Station IS/MND,
20 | because it failed to comply with procedural requirements of CEQA, including but not
21 l limited to the following:

22 a. Despite substantial revisions to the Wildflower Station IS/MND and

23 Wildflower Station Project Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting

24 Program ("Wildflower Station MMRP"), the Wildflower Station

25 IS/MND and Wildflower Station Mitigation Program were not

26 recirculated.

27 b. The Wildflower MMRP was not circulated for public review before the

28 City's certification of the Wildflower Station IS/MND.

VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND
14270179.3 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

C. The City failed to consult with and/or provide transportation

2 information to the relevant regional transportation planning agency.

3 6 Accordingly, Discovery seeks a peremptory writ of mandate pursuant to
4 Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 and/or section 1094.5 setting aside the certification

5 of the City's Wildflower Station IS/MND and its approval of the Wildflower Station Project,
6and ordering the City to prepare an EIR that fully analyzes all significant impacts of the
7 Wildflower Station Project in conjunction with the Land Use Element Update and
8 Downtown Specific Plan before approving the Wildflower Station Project.

9 7. Discovery seeks a declaration by this Court that the City must fully comply

10 with the requirements of CEQA in its review of the Wildflower Station Project, and that the
11 City must prepare a CEQA-compliant EIR before approving the Wildflower Station
12 || Project.

13 8. Discovery seeks injunctive relief by this Court enjoining the City from
14 implementing the Wildflower Station Project, which was approved in violation of CEQA.

15 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

16 9. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to CEQA, Public Resources Code
17 I sections 21167, 21168, and 21168.5, and Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and

18 1094.5.

19 10. The City of Antioch is located within Contra Costa County, and venue is
20 proper in Contra Costa County pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 394(a).

21 PARTIES

22 11. Petitioner and Plaintiff Discovery Builders, Inc. is a California corporation

23 and home builder with its principal place of business in Contra Costa County. Discovery
24 owns property near the Wildflower Station Project and conducts business in Contra Costa
25 County and the City of Antioch.

26 12. The City of Antioch is a municipality incorporated in 1872 and the lead
27| agency under CEQA for the Wildflower Station Project. On February 27, 2018, the

28 Antioch City Council certified the Wildflower Station IS/MND and approved the Wildflower
-3-
VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND
14270179.3 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Station Project. On March 6. 2018, the City filed a Notice of Determination for the
2 | Wildflower Station Project with the Contra Costa County Clerk.

3 13. DeNova Homes, Inc. ("DeNova") is a California corporation and a developer
4 with its principal place of business in Contra Costa County. DeNova is the project
5 proponent for the Wildflower Station Project.

6 STANDING

7 14. Petitioner and Plaintiff Discovery has standing to bring this petition and
complaint because it is the owner of real property located near the Wildflower Station
9 Project. Therefore, Discovery's property interests have a geographical nexus to the
10 Wildflower Station Project and will be affected by the Wildflower Station Project's
11 environmental impacts.

12 15. Discovery has exhausted its administrative remedies, by objections
13| interposed in writing during the administrative proceedings leading to the approval of the
14 Wildflower Station Project, including without limitation written comments submitted to the
15 City's Mayor and City Councilmembers on February 13, 2018 and February 27, 2018.

16 16. Discovery has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by
17 previously serving by mail a Notice of Commencement of Action described in California
18 Public Resources Code section 21167 upon the City. The Notice and Proof of Service of
19 the Notice have been filed with this petition.

20 FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

21 A. The Wildflower Station Project

22 17. Discovery and its affiliated entities are the owners and developers of
23 significant real property holdings in the City of Antioch, and as a property owner,
24 Discovery maintains both a beneficial and public interest in ensuring sound land use
25 planning within the City, including an interest in ensuring that the City properly identify,

26 analyze, and mitigate potentially significant impacts within its jurisdiction.

27 18. The City adopted the 2003 General Plan on November 24, 2003. The City
28 prepared the General Plan EIR (State Clearinghouse No. 2003072140) in July 2003,

-4-

14270179.3 VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 which was certified by the City Council on November 24, 2003. The General Plan

2 designated the Wildflower Station Project area for commercial uses and zoned the area

3 as Planned Development District (PD 81-8) and Neighborhood/Community Commercial

4 (C-2). (Wildflower Station IS/MND, p. 2)

5 19. In or around February 2015, DeNova Homes submitted a preliminary
6 development application (PDP-15-01) to the City of Antioch for preliminary review of the
7 Hillcrest/Wildflower Mixed Use Project, a project to a develop approximately 23 acres of
8 vacant land at the northeast corner of the intersection of Hillcrest Avenue and Wildflower

9 Drive (APN 053-140-002), located within the PD/C-2 (Planned Development;
10 Neighborhood/Community Commercial) Zoning District, which does not allow residential
11 uses. As initially proposed, the development was to include approximately 100 apartment

12 units, 24 single family lots, and approximately 9.52 acres of commercial development.

13 20. Following the submission of the preliminary development application, the
14 Planning Commission conducted a preliminary review of the proposal. In response to
15 public comments that expressed concerns about the effects of the Preliminary
16 Development Plan, including concerns about traffic, speeds, and congestion, the

17 Planning Commission provided comments to. DeNova that included a' request a for a traffic
18 study and recommendations regarding improved access to the multi-family use, the
19 inclusion of amenities, and the design of commercial uses. (Staff Report to City Council

20 for Feb. 13, 2018 City Council Meeting, p. 4)

21 21. Subsequently, DeNova refined its proposed development to propose a
22 | residential and commercial mixed-use project of approximately 23 acres with three
23 components: (a) Single Family Residential development on the hilltop/eastern portion of
24 the site comprised of open space, a private road, and number parcels 1 through 22 for
25  home sites; (b) Multi-Family/Condominium development in the middle of the site, to
26  include four residential buildings with 98 condominium units; and (c) Commercial
27 development adjacent to Hillcrest Avenue for nine new commercial buildings totaling
28 89,422 square feet (the "Wildflower Station Project").

VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND
14270179.3 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 22. On August 19, 2015, DeNova presented the Wildflower Station Preliminary
2 Development Plan (PDP) application to the Planning Commission. The application sought
3 approval of the Wildflower Station Project, including a General Plan Amendment from
4 Neighborhood Community Commercial (NC) to Mixed-Use (MU) (GP-16-01), a Rezone
5 from Planned Development I District (PD) and Neighborhood/Community Commercial (C-

6 2) to Planned Development District (PD), a Planned Development (PD) ordinance that
7 specifies allowed uses and development standards (PD-16-03), a Vesting Tentative Map
8 to subdivide the site into commercial, multi-family and single family lots (PW-460-4), a
9 Final Development Plan (AR-16-04), and a Use Permit to allow Project construction and
10 a proposed drive-thru use (UP-16-08).

11 23. By notice dated August 29, 2017, the City issued a Notice of Intent to Adopt

12 an Initial Study and Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Wildflower Station IS/MND. On
13 September 12, 2017, the City released to the public the Wildflower Station Initial Study
14 and Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Wildflower Station Project ("Wildflower Station
15 IS/MND"). The Wildflower Station IS/MND was circulated for public review on September

16 12, 2017.

17 24. The Wildflower Station IS/MND includes and relies upon outdated technical
18 studies, including a Cultural Resources study prepared in 2014, presumably for the

19 project that was initially proposed, and a Biological Resources study that was prepared in
20 2015, prior to the identification of a Swainson's Hawk nest in the vicinity of the Project

21 Site. The IS/MND's greenhouse gas emissions analysis similarly relies on outdated
22 thresholds of significance adopted by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District in
23 2009. In addition, because the Wildflower Station IS/MND did not include as attachments
24 referenced documents including the 2015 biological resources analysis, a 2014 wetland
25 delineation, a residential nationwide section 404 permit, and a certified arborist report,
26 meaningful review of the Project's potential impacts was not possible.

27 25. By letter dated September 9, 2017, the California Department of
28 Transportation ("Caltrans") submitted comments requesting details on project phases and
-6-

14270179.3 VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 suggesting that the City work in conjunction with local transit providers to improve

2 regional accessibility, given the number of users the Project would add to state routes.
3 Caltrans noted that failure to accommodate for anticipated demand will lead to further
4 congestion and greenhouse gas emissions for the region. Caltrans also encouraged the
5 development of Travel Demand Management ("TDM") policies to encourage the use of
6 the nearest public transit lines and reduce vehicle trips on the State Transportation
7  Network and requested that the City identify Project-generated travel demand, estimate
8 the costs of public transportation improvements necessitated for the proposed Project,
9 and identify viable funding sources such as development and/or transportation impact
10 fees, with a sufficient allocation of fair share contributions toward multi-modal and
11 regional transit improvements to fully mitigate cumulative impacts to regional
12 transportation. The City made no changes to the Wildflower Station IS/MND in response

13 to the comment letter from Caltrans.

14 26. By email dated October 18, 2017, the California Department of Fish and
15 Wildlife ("CDFW") submitted comments requesting compensatory mitigation for the
habitat for Swainson's hawk. The commented noted that after 16 potential loss of foraging
17 the preparation of the biological resources study, the California Natural Diversity
18 Database was updated with an active Swainson's hawk nest occurrence within 1/4-mile
19 of the Project Site. In response to this comment letter, mitigation measure MM 4.8 to
20 require compensatory mitigation for Swainson's hawk foraging habitat was added to the
21 Wildflower Station MMRP.

22 27. On January 17, 2018, the Planning Commission adopted four resolutions
23 recommending the City Council's approval of the Wildflower Station Project:

24 (a) Resolution No. 2018-03, recommending adoption of the Wildflower Station IS/MND
25 and MMRP; (b) Resolution No. 2018-04, recommending approval of the Wildflower
26 Station General Plan Amendment (GP-16-01) changing the land use designation from
27 Neighborhood Community Commercial to Mixed Use; (c) Resolution No. 2018-05,

28 recommending approval of an ordinance for a zoning map amendment from Planned
-7-

14270179.3 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Development District and Neighborhood/Community Commercial (C-2) to Planned
2 Development District (PD-16-03); and (d) Resolution No. 2018-06, recommending
3 approval of a Vesting Tentative Map/Final Development Plan, Use Permit and Design

4 Review subject to conditions of approval (PW-460-4, UP-16-08, AR-16-04).

5 28. By letter dated January 24, 2018, counsel for Discovery submitted a
6 request for copies of the City's records relating to the Wildflower Station Project, pursuant

7 to the California Public Records Act, Government Code Sections 6250, et seq. (the "PRA
8 Request"). By letter dated January 30, 2018 and transmitted by email on February 2,
9 |2018. the City indicated that additional time was needed to respond to the PRA Request
10 due to the breadth of scope and time period of the request. On February 7, 2018, the City
11 indicated by telephone that the responsive records were anticipated to be made available
12 the week of February 26, 2018, more than a month after the PRA Request was
13 submitted. On March 2, 2018, the City made available for review and duplication, a
14 | portion of the documents responsive to the PRA Request comprised of hard copy
15 records. On March 16, 2018, the City made available electronic documents responsive to
16 the PRA Request. In the meantime, the City Council had conducted a public hearing on

17 and approved the Wildflower Station Project and adopted the Wildflower Station IS/MND,

18 as detailed further below.

19 29. By letter to the City Council dated February 13, 2018, Discovery submitted
20 detailed comments to the City regarding the Project, describing the legal inadequacy of
21 the Wildflower Station IS/MND, and requesting a continuance to allow Discovery and
22 members of the public a meaningful opportunity to review documents responsive to the
23 PRA Request, which again, the City had not yet made available. In its letter, Discovery
24 argued that the Wildflower Station IS/MND required recirculation due to substantial
25 revisions made following the close of the prior public review period, and that there was
26 substantial evidence showing that the Wildflower Station Project could have a number of
27 potentially significant impacts on the environment, particularly in the areas of Cultural
28 Resources, Biological Resources, and Greenhouse Gas Emissions, which were not
-8-
VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND
14270179.3 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

property identified, analyzed, or mitigated in the Wildflower Station IS/MND and that must
2 be properly considered in an environmental impact report. Discovery also asserted that

3 the City's proposed reliance on the Wildflower Station IS/MND was improper because the
4 required General Plan Amendment was one of several land use updates, discussed
5 below, that the City had improperly segmented for purposes of avoiding full disclosure of
6 environmental impacts. Discovery further explained that the City's concurrent preparation

7 of multiple addenda to the City's 2003 General Plan EIR resulted in improper

8 piecemealing or segmentation.

9 B. Related Projects with Significant Environmental Impacts

10 30. At its January 23, 2018 meeting, the City Council adopted Resolution No.
11 2018/15, amending the Land Use Element of the General Plan ("Land Use Element

12 Update") and Resolution No. 2018/14 approving an Addendum to the City's 2003 General
13 Plan EIR, which was adopted by the City on November 24, 2003.

14 31. The Land Use Element Update eliminated the policies for the Downtown
15 area that had been components of the Land Use Element, and replaced them with a
16 reference to the Downtown Specific Plan, which was separately adopted and for which a
17 separate addendum was prepared. On January 23, 2018, the City Council adopted
18 Resolution No. 2018/16 approving an Addendum to the 2003 General Plan EIR for the
19 City's Downtown Specific Plan. Upon second reading on February 13, 2018, the City
20 adopted Ordinance No. 2135-C-S, adopting the Downtown Specific Plan.

21 32. Because of the strong linkage between the Downtown Specific Plan, the
22 General Plan Land Use Update, and the Wildflower Station Project and the General Plan
23 Amendment required for the Project, CEQA required these actions to be evaluated

24 together with other integral projects to ensure the environmental impacts of the activities
25| were properly identified and considered. As a result of the City's practice of segmenting
26 its environmental impact analysis, the Wildflower Station IS/MND failed to property
27  identify, analyze, and mitigate the Project's potentially significant cumulative impacts.

28

14270179.3 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

r C. Approval of the Wildflower Station Project

2 33. On February 13, 2018, the Wildflower Station Project came on for public
3 hearing before the City Council. At the hearing, the City Council approved the following

4 resolutions: (a) Resolution No. 2018/18 adopting the Wildflower Station IS/MND and

5 MMRP; (b) Resolution No. 2018/19 approving the Wildflower Station General Plan
6 Amendment (GP-16-01) changing the land use designation from Neighborhood
7 Community Commercial to Mixed Use; and (c) Resolution No. 2018/20 approving a
8. Vesting Tentative Map/Final Development Plan, Use Permit, and Design Review subject
g to conditions of approval (PW 460-4, UP-16-08, AR-16-04). The City Council introduced
10 the ordinance for a zoning map amendment from Planned Development District and
11 Neighborhood/Community Commercial (C-2) to Planned Development District (PD-16-
12 03).

13 34. By letter to the City Council dated February 27, 2018, Discovery submitted
14 I comments to the City regarding the Project and objected to the City's reliance on the
15 Wildflower Station IS/MND for the approval of the Project. Discovery reiterated that the
16 City could not approve the Project in reliance upon the IS/MND, pointed out that the City
17 had failed to provide any response to the concerns described in its February 13, 2018
18 letter, and noted that the City had still not provided the documents responsive to the PRA
19 Request.

20 35. On February 27, 2018, the City Council adopted, upon a second reading,
21 Ordinance No. 2136-C-S approving the rezone from Planned Development District and
22 Neighborhood/Community Commercial (C-2) to Planned Development (PD-16-03).

23 36. On March 6. 2018, the City filed a Notice of Determination for the City's

24 approval of the Wildflower Station Project pursuant to CEQA Section 21152.

25 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

26 [Writ of Mandate - Violation of CEQA]

27 37. Discovery refers to and herein incorporates by reference Paragraphs
28 through 36, as if stated in full herein.
-10-
VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR DECLÄRATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND
14270179.3 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 A. The City Improperly Segmented Environmental Analysis of the

2 Wildflower Station Project.

3 38. CEQA requires that an environmental impact analysis must evaluate
4 I activities that are a "reasonably foreseeable consequence" of a proposed project to make

5 sure that an environmental document examines the full impacts that will result from

6 project approval. (Banning Ranch Conservancy v City of Newport Bcach (2012) 211
7 Cal.App.4th 1209, 1224.) CEQA prohibits the "piecemealing" of single large projects into
8| smaller projects that fail to consider the cumulative impacts of the project as a whole. (Id.)
9A lead agency cannot avoid its obligation to prepare an EIR by segmenting projects into
10 smaller pieces which, considered individually, may be found to have no significant impact

11 on the environment. (Tuolumne County Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. v City of
12 | Sonora (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 1214; Association for a Cleaner Envt. v Yosemite
13 Community College Dist. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 629, 638.)

14 39. The Wildflower Station Project must be evaluated in connection with other
15 changes to land use in and around the City of Antioch, including but not limited to the
16 || Land Use Element Update, as well as development in the Downtown Specific Plan. The

17 Wildflower Station Project is part of a larger series of land use updates to the City's
18 General Plan and area-specific development projects.

19 40. The City abused its discretion, and failed to proceed as required by law, in
20 failing to examine the potential impacts of the Wildflower Station Project, Land Use

2.1 Element Update, and Downtown Specific Plan together, unlawfully segmenting and
22 deferring analysis of cumulative impacts of these projects.

23 B. The City Failed to Adequately Examine Potentially Significant Impacts

24 of the Project Despite a Fair Argument, Based on Substantial Evidence, That the Wildflower Station Project May Have Significant

25 Impacts

26 41. Pursuant if to CEQA, if an agency determines there is substantial evidence
27 | that any aspect of the project, individually or cumulatively, may cause a significant effect
28|on the environment, the lead agency must (1) prepare an EIR, (2) use a previously
-11-
VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND
14270179.3 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 prepared EIR which adequately analyzes the relevant project, or (3) determine which
2 effects were adequately examined by an earlier EIR or negative declaration pursuant to
3 an appropriate CEQA process, and which effects must be analyzed in a subsequent EIR

4 or negative declaration. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15063(b)(1).) Substantial evidence

5 means there is enough relevant information and reasonable inferences from the
6 information presented to the agency that a fair argument can be made to support a a

7 conclusion. (ld. § 15384.) An EIR is required whenever "substantial evidence in the
8 I record supports a 'fair argument' that significant impacts or effects may occur." (City of

9 Arcadia v. State Water Resources Control Board (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 1392, 1421.)

10 42. A "mitigated negative declaration" is permissible only in certain limited
11 I circumstances: (1) if the initial study shows there is no substantial evidence the project
12 may have a significant effect on the environment, or (2) the initial study identifies
13 || potentially significant effects-as herebut (a) revisions can be made to the project
14 | before public release of the negative declaration and initial study which avoid or mitigate
15 the potentially significant effects, and (b) there is no substantial evidence in light of the
16 whole record that the a project may have a significant effect on the environment. (Pub.
17 Resources Code, § 21064.5; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15070.) The City's certification of
18 || the Wildflower Station IS/MND was an impermissible abuse of discretion, because there
19 was substantial evidence to support a fair argument, based on the entire record, that the
20 Wildflower Station Project may have significant environmental effects. (See Laurel
21 Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of California (1993) 6 Cal.4th 1112,
22 1123.)

23 43. The City abused its discretion, and failed to proceed as required by law, by
24 failing to recognize substantial evidence that there are fair arguments the Wildflower
25 Station Project may cause potentially significant impacts to the environment. The
26| Wildflower Station IS/MND identifies numerous potentially significant impacts in the areas

27 of Biological Resources, Cultural Resources, and Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

28 44. There is substantial evidence in the record that the Wildflower Station
-12-
VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND'INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND
14270179.3 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Project will cause potentially significant impacts, contrary to the findings made by the
2 City. These impacts include, but are not limited to, the following:

3 a. Biological Resources: The Biological Resources analysis indicates
that the Wildflower Station Project area was inadequately assessed
from the ground level. The Biological Resources analysis fails to

6 identify grassland habitats for nesting. Mitigation measures

7 pertaining to nesting are also inadequate to mitigate potentially

8 significant impacts to species. In addition, the Biological Resources

Q analysis does not contain a wetlands delineation or relevant section

10 404 permitting, rendering it impossible to determine whether

11 wetlands were properly evaluated. Finally, the analysis relies on

12 numerous documents that are referenced but not included in the

13 record, including but not limited to a 2015 analysis conducted by

14 Monk & Associates; a 2015 biological resources analysis; a 2014

15 wetland delineation purportedly verified by the United State Army

16 Corps of Engineers; a residential nationwide section 404 permit; and

17 a certified arborist report. Accordingly, Discovery and other members

18 of the public were unable to meaningfully review the adequacy of the

19 Biological Resources analysis.

20 b. Cultural Resources: The Wildflower Station IS/MND relies on an

21 outdated 2014 cultural resources study. The IS/MND indicates the

22 Wildflower Station Project may cause a substantial change in an

23 archaeological resource, could disturb human remains, and may

24 destroy a unique paleontological resource. The mitigation measure

25 proposed, for the project applicant or contractor to avoid resources,

26 is flawed, vague, and unenforceable. Moreover, Discovery presented

27 evidence that its consulting archaeologist identified additional cultural

28 resources within the Wildflower Station Project area that are not
-13-
VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND
14270179.3 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-3

2

to assessed in the Wildflower Station IS/MND, as required by CEQA.

4 Finally, the Wildflower Station Project does not identify lead federal

mn agencies for environmental permitting, and does not identify or

C. describe an area of Potential Effects.

6

7 Greenhouse Gas Emissions: The Wildflower Station IS/MND's

8 analysis of greenhouse gas emissions improperly utilizes outdated,

O legally invalid thresholds of significant adopted by the Bay Area Air

10 Quality Management District in 2009. The adoption of these

11 thresholds is not supported by substantial evidence that the City

12 properly considered the appropriate threshold of significant, as

d. required by CEQA Guidelines Section 15064.7.

13

14 Cumulative Impacts: The Wildflower Station IS/MND fails to satisfy

15 the a requirements of a cumulative impacts analysis, failing to mention

16 potential cumulative impacts in the areas of Aesthetics, Agriculture

17 and Forestry Resources, Biological Resources, Geology and Soils,

18 Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Hydrology and Water Quality, Land

19 Use and Planning, Mineral Resources, Population and Housing,

20 Public Services, and Tribal Cultural Resources, although the

21 Wildflower Station Project and Wildflower Station IS/MND identifies

22 potential impacts to these areas. Moreover, the Wildflower Station

23 IS/MND incorrectly assumes that impacts associated with the project

24 are minor, and therefore cannot result in any cumulative impacts.

25 Additionally, because the City improperly segmented the Wildflower

26 Station Project from other integral parts of the project, including the

27 45. Land Use Element Update and Downtown Specific Plan, the

28 Wildflower IS/MND fails to adequately analyze cumulative impacts.
The City dismissed Discovery's comments, noting simply in the February

14270179.3 13, 2018 City Council meeting minutes that "City Clerk Simonsen announced the City
- 14-
VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

received a letter regarding Consent Calendar Item 1F received late this afternoon from
2 HansenBridgett [sic] and copies were provided to Council and available for the public in
3 Council Chambers this evening." (February 13, 2018 City Council Meeting Minutes.)
4 There was no discussion of the merit of Discovery's comments.

5 46. Because substantial evidence in the record supports a fair argument that

6 the Wildflower Station Project may have significant environmental impacts or effects, as

7 described above, the City abused its discretion in approving the Project without preparing

8 an EIR.

9 C. The City Failed to Comply with Public Participation and Information Disclosure Provisions of CEQA.
10

11 47. CEQA mandates that agencies "solicit and respond to comments from the
12  public and from other agencies concerned with the project." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, §

13 15002(j).) The policy purpose of environmental review under CEQA is to demonstrate to
14 the public that an agency has analyzed and considered the environmental implications of
15  its action. (ld. § 15003(d).)

16 48. The City has failed to respond to Discovery's comments regarding the
17 Wildflower Station Project and Wildflower Station IS/MND. Although Discovery submitted
18 written comments to the City on February 13 and February 27, 2018 regarding the
19 |inadequacy of the Wildflower Station IS/MND, the City did not address, in the February

20 13, 2018 City Council meeting recommending certification of the Wildflower Station
21 IS/MND and approval of the Wildflower Station Project, or elsewhere, Discovery's
22 substantive comments. The meeting minutes for the February 13, 2018 City Council
23 meeting state simply that "City Clerk Simonsen announced the City received a letter
24 regarding Consent Calendar Item 1F received late this afternoon from HansenBridgett
25 [sic] and copies were provided to Council and available for the public in Council
26 Chambers this evening." (February 13, 2018 City Council Meeting Minutes.)

27 49. The City prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to act in a manner
28 required by law by insufficiently responding to Discovery's comments and objections to
-15-
VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND
14270179.3 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 the Wildflower Station Project and Wildflower Station IS/MND.

2 D. The City Failed to Comply With Procedural Requirements for

3 Certifying the Wildflower Station IS/MND.

4 50. CEQA mandates that a lead agency must recirculate a negative declaration

5 if it is substantially revised after public notice has been given and before certification. 14
6 Cal. Code Regs., § 15073.5(a). A "substantial revision" includes a scenario a in which
"new, avoidable significant effect is identified and mitigation measures or project revisions
8 must be added in order to reduce the effect to insignificance. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14, §

Q 15073.5(b)(2)

10 51. On October 18, 2017, CDFW submitted comments identifying a Swainson's

11 hawk habitat and requested a new mitigation measure to address the potential loss of
12 foraging habitat for Swainson's hawk. Following consultation with CDFW, the City added

13 Mitigation Measure 4.8 to the Wildflower Station MMRP.

14 52. The City prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to act in a manner
15 required by law by failing to recirculate the Wildflower Station IS/MND after it was
16 substantially revised by the addition of Mitigation Measure 4.8 after the public comment
17 period closed.

18 53. A mitigation monitoring and reporting program is a mandatory requirement
19 of CEQA that must be considered and approved prior to project approval. (Pub.
20 Resources Code, § 21081.6; 14 Cal. Code Regs., § 15074(d).) A lead agency must

21 circulate for public review and comment a mitigation monitoring and reporting program
22 before project approval.

23 54. The February 13, 2018 City Council staff report recommending approval of
24 the Wildfiower Station IS/MND and MMRP did not include a copy of the MMRP itself,
25 despite stating otherwise. (See Attachment A1 to February 13, 2018 City Council
26 Agenda.) Despite its failure to circulate the Wildflower Station MMRP to the public, the
27 City approved Resolution No. 2018/18 adopting the Wildflower Station IS/MND and

28 MMRP at the February 13, 2018 City Council meeting.
-16-
VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND
14270179.3 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 55. Additionally, CEQA specifies that a lead agency consult with transportation
2 planning agencies and public agencies with transportation facilities that could be affected

3 by a project, for the purpose of obtaining information about a project's effects on major

4 local arterials, public transit, freeways, highways, overpasses, on-ramps, off-ramps, and

5 rail transit service. Moreover, to the extent that transportation information is contained in

6 a mandatory reporting or monitoring program, such information must be submitted to the
7 relevant transportation planning agency in the region.

8 56. There is no evidence in staff reports or other public documents that any
9 consultation with the regional transportation planning agency took place. In addition,

10 although the Wildflower Station IS/MND proposed mitigation measures to address
11 transportation impacts, the City did not provide any related transportation information to
12 the regional transportation planning agency.

13 57. The City therefore prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to act in a
14 manner required by law by failing to recirculate the Wildflower Station MMRP for public
15 review and comment before certifying the Wildflower Station IS/MND and approving the
16 Wildflower Station Project, and by failing to consult with and/or provide required
17 information to the regional transportation planning agency.

18 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

19 [Declaratory Relief]

20 58. Discovery refers to and herein incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1
21 through 57, as if stated in full herein.

22 59. An actual controversy exists between Discovery and the City in that

23 Discovery contends that the City improperly segmented the Wildflower Station Project
24 from other integral parts of the project, including the Land Use Element Update and
25 Downtown Specific Plan, and that these projects must be evaluated together in
26 compliance with CEQA, whereas the City contends it met its legal obligations pursuant to

27 CEQA.

28 60. An actual controversy exists between Discovery and the City in that
-17-
VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND
14270179.3 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Discovery contends that the City did not prepare and certify the Wildflower Station

2 IS/MND in compliance with CEQA, and that an EIR is required to evaluate significant
environmental impacts of the Wildflower Station Project, whereas the City contends it met

4 its legal obligations pursuant to CEQA.

5 61. Discovery desires a declaration from this Court pursuant to California Code

6 of Civil Procedure section 1060 et seq. that the City must comply with all requirements of

7 CEQA, Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq., and related regulations, and must

8 prepare an EIR for the Wildflower Station Project before approving the Wildflower Station
9 Project.

10 62. Such a declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time in order for
11 Discovery to ascertain its rights, and the City's obligations, duties, and legal
12 responsibilities with respect to its CEQA obligations for the Wildflower Station Project.

13 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

14 [Injunctive Relief]

15 63. Discovery refers to and herein incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1
16 through 62, as if stated in full herein.

17 64. Discovery owns land near the Wildflower Station Project. Discovery's
18 property in the area will be adversely affected due to the environmental impacts of the
19 approval of the Wildflower Station Project as a direct result of the City's acts, omissions,

20 and failures to comply with CEQA as alleged herein, including but not limited to the City's
21  failure to adequately examine significant impacts of the Wildflower Station Project.

22 65. Such conduct by the City is wrongful and violates California law as
23 previously alleged herein.

24 66. Unless and until enjoined from violating CEQA and implementing the

25 approved Wildflower Station Project, the City will continue its wrongful and harmful
26 conduct, and the City's conduct will cause Discovery irreparable injury.

27 67. Monetary compensation alone would not provide adequate relief, and
28 Discovery has no adequate remedy at law for the damages to be sustained if the City
-18-
VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND
14270179.3 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

continues its wrongful act of implementing the Wildflower Station Project.

2 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

14. Station Project.

15 D. For a declaratory judgment that the City must comply with all requirements
16 of CEQA, Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq., and its implementing regulations,
17 including but not limited to the requirement to prepare a CEQA-compliant EIR, before
18 approving the Wildflower Station Project.

19 E. For the issuance of preliminary and permanent injunctions in favor of
20 Discovery restraining the City, and its agents, employees, officers, and representatives
21 from taking or authorizing any action to implement the Wildflower Station Project pending
22 full compliance with CEQA.
23 F. For judgment in favor of Discovery and against the City, enjoining the City
24 and its agents, employees, officers, and representatives, preliminarily and permanently,
25 from implementing any Wildflower Station Project that is legally insufficient and inadequate
