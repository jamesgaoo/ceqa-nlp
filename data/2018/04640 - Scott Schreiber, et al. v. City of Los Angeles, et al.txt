20 INTRODUCTION

21 1. Petitioners Scott Schreiber and Jessica Sabbah-Mani (hereinafter,
22 I "Petitioners") hereby petition this Court, pursuant to, inter alia, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code §§

23 1085, 1094.5 & 1094.6 and Cal. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168 & 21168.5 (the California
24 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA")) for a writ of mandate directed to respondents to

25 vacate and annul the "Letter of Determination" of the City Planning Commission of the
26 City of Los Angeles (the "Planning Commission") dated March 16, 2018, in Case No.

27 |CPC-2016-2203-DB and CEQA No. ENV-2016-2204-CE, approving plans for the

28 I construction of a 75 foot tall luxury apartment development at 488-498 San Vicente

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Boulevard, Los Angeles, California 90048 (the "Project"), and to compel the Planning
2 Commission to consider approval of the Project in the manner required by law.

3 2. The developer of the Project, in return for five (5) deed-restricted affordable
4 units, seeks to construct the Project 30 feet and four stories higher than local zoning law
5 allows while also benefitting from numerous other "off-menu" concessions. The Project is

6 an abuse of the City's density bonus ordinance (Los Angeles Municipal Code, ch. 1, art. 2,

7 sec. 12.22, sub-sec. A.25, hereinafter, "L.A.M.C. 12.22 A.25"), which only permits "off-

8 menu" zoning concessions (i.e. those not mandated by state law) when they are needed to

9 make the construction of deed-restricted, affordable housing economically feasible. The

10 developer's requested variances from local zoning laws bear no relation whatsoever to

11 what is needed to feasibly include affordable housing in the Project. Rather, the

12 construction of the five units of affordable housing is being parlayed into an opportunity to

13 generate windfall profit. The developer's windfall is the local neighborhood's loss, and,

14 more pertinently, it violates state and local law.
3. In its findings approving the Project, the Planning Commission erred in its
15 interpretation and application of the law and otherwise overstepped the bounds of its
16 discretion. If the Planning Commission had properly identified and construed the relevant
17 legal standards and considered the relevant evidence, it would have been forced to
18 acknowledge that approval of the Project was without legal basis and beyond its
19 jurisdiction. The Court exercises de novo independent judgment on review of the Planning
20 Commission's incorrect interpretation of the relevant law and should vacate the Planning
21 Commission's decision on this basis.
22 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

23 4. This Court has jurisdiction under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 1085 and Cal. Pub.
24 Res. Code § 21168.9.

25 5. Venue is proper in this Court because the acts and omissions complained of
26 herein occurred in Los Angeles County (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 393). Respondent, the
27 City of Los Angeles (*Respondent") is situated in Los Angeles County (Cal. Civ. Proc.
28 Code § 394(a)). The real properties that are the subject of this petition are situated in Los

3054674.1 -2-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Angeles County (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 392(a)).

2 PARTIES

3 6. Petitioners reside in a single family, residential home at 6706 Drexel

4 Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90064, approximately 100 feet east of the Project that is
5 the subject of this petition.

6 7. Respondent is a California charter city and a "local agency" as defined in
7 Cal. Gov't Code § 54591(a)) with responsibility for planning, building and safety and
8 related administrative functions in connection with the construction of new and infill

9 development within its boundaries, as well as for enforcing local, state and federal law in
10 connection with same.

11 8. Respondent delegates certain executive functions during the planning and
12 permitting process to the Planning Commission.
13 9. Respondent Kiwi Neman is an individual, who upon information and belief
14 resides in the County of Los Angeles, and is an applicant for and recipient of approvals in
15 connection with the Project, and is therefore real party in interest to this Petition.

16 10. Respondent 488 San Vicente, LLC is a California limited liability company
17 with its principal place of business in the County of Los Angeles, and is an applicant for
18 and recipient of approvals in connection with the Project, and is therefore a real party in
19 interest to this Petition.

20 11. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of respondents sued
21 herein as Does 1 through 10, inclusive, and therefore sues these respondents by such
22 fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this petition to allege their true names and
23 capacities when ascertained. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that
24 each of these fictitiously imed respondents is responsible in some manner for the acts and
25 omissions herein alleged.

26 STATUTORY BACKGROUND

27 12. California's Density Bonus Law (Cal. Gov't Code §§ 65915-65918), which
28 mandates that every city and county adopt a density bonus ordinance consistent with it,

3054674.1
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 was first enacted in 1979. In recent years it has been modified in almost every legislative
2 session. The overall purpose of the law, which is laudable, is to encourage construction of
3 affordable housing by requiring local governments to increase the number of allowable
4 residential units and provide additional concessions and incentives to builders. However,
5 due to the complexity of the law, the constant flux of the law's text in recent years, and

6 because the law provides for an award of attorneys' fees and costs against a local authority
7 that refuses to grant an application that complies with the law, municipalities are
themselves incentivized to err on the side of approval of any project that contains any

9 affordable housing. The Project at issue is an example of that. The Planning Commission
10 has approved construction that violates local zoning laws and ignores local democratic
11 controls even though the state law does not compel such an approval. The state law
12 overrides certain zoning controls and development standards, but it does not shred them
13 all.

14 13. Some of the key requirements and provisions of the state law, as relevant to
15 this petition, can be summarized as follows:

16 (a) The City is required to grant a density bonus according to a specified
17 formula to qualified applicants that incorporate affordable housing into their development
18  projects (Cal. Gov't Code § 65915(b)(1));
19 (b) In the case of the Project, the developer qualified for a density bonus of
20 35% because 11% of the proposed development consists of "Very Low Income" housing
21 units (Cal. Gov't Code § 65915(f)(2));

22 (c) "The granting of a density bonus shall not require, or be interpreted, in
23 and of itself, to require a general plan amendment, local coastal plan amendment, zoning
24 change, or other discretionary approval" (Cal. Gov't Code § 65915(f)(5));
25 (d) "Except as [otherwise] provided. .. the granting of a density bonus shall
26 not require or be interpreted to require the waiver of a local ordinance or provisions of a
27 local ordinance unrelated to development standards" (Cal. Gov't Code § 65915(j)(2);

28

3054674.1
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- (e) The City is required to grant, under another formula, a specified number
2 of "incentives and concessions". (Cal. Gov't Code § 65915(b)(1), (d).) Significantly for
3 this case, the State density bonus statute prescribes by definition a that a "concession or
4 incentive" may be granted only if it will reduce development costs. (Cal. Gov't Code §
5 65915(k));

6 (f) In the case of the Project, the developer is entitled to two (2) concessions
7 or incentives because at least 10% of the total units in the proposed development consist of

8 "Very Low Income" housing units (Cal. Gov't Code § 65915(d)(2)(B));

9 (g) "The granting of a concession or incentive shall not require or be
10 interpreted, in and of itself, to require a general plan amendment, local coastal plan
11 amendment, zoning change, study, or other discretionary approval." (Cal. Gov't Code §
12 65915()(1);

13 (h) Additionally, a local authority is not permitted to apply any development
14 standard that will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a
15 development meeting the requirements of the state law at the densities or with the
16 concessions or incentives required by the state law, unless waiver or reduction of the
17 development standard would have a specific, adverse impact on health, safety or the
18 physical environment for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or
19 avoid the specific adverse impact (Cal. Gov't Code § 65915(e) (emphasis added)).
20 THE CITY'S DENSITY BONUS ORDINANCE

21 14. Respondent has adopted a density bonus ordinance, with the stated purpose
22 of establishing procedures for implementing state density bonus requirements. (L.A.M.C.
23 12.22 A.25(a).)

24 15. Some of the key portions of the local ordinance can be summarized as
25 follows:

26 (a) L.A.M.C. 12.22 A.25(c)(1) incorporates the state law's formula for
27 density bonuses, including subsection (f)(2)'s 35% density bonus for developments with
28 11% of "Very Low Income" housing units;

3054674.1 -5-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

(b) L.A.M.C. 12.22 A.25(e)(1) incorporates the state law's formula for
2 concessions and incentives, including subsection (d)(2)(B)'s requirement to provide two

3 (2) incentives and concessions to developments with 10% or more of units restricted for
4  "Very Low Income" housing. The City's ordinance then sets forth a "Menu of
5 Incentives," which the developer may choose from (L.A.M.C. 12.22 A.25(f));

6 (c) L.A.M.C. 12.22 A.25(g)(3) makes further provision for "off-menu"
concessions and incentives. Specifically, a developer may request "a waiver or
modification of any development standard(s) that is not included on the Menu of

9 Incentives." Such a request
10 shall include a pro forma or other documentation to show that

11 the waiver or modification of any development standard(s) are needed in order to make the Restricted Affordable Units

12 economically feasible

13 L.A.M.C. 12.22 A.25(g)(2)c.(i) & (3)(i)a (emphasis added). The request shall be approved
14 unless the decision-maker, based upon substantial evidence, makes a finding that

15 The Incentive is not required in order to provide for
16 affordable housing costs

17 L.A.M.C. 12.22 A.25(g)(2)c.(i) & (3)(ii)c (emphasis added).
18 16. Petitioners are informed and believe, and based on such information and
19 belief allege, that the applicant Respondents never submitted the required proforma or
20 other documentation required for an off-menu incentive, and that the City's Planning
21 Commission had no such proforma or documentation before it when it approved the
22 application. The record before the Planning Commission was devoid of substantial
23 evidence that the requested incentives were needed to make the Restricted Affordable
24 Units economically feasible, and indeed the only substantial evidence in the record
25 concerning economic feasibility demonstrates that the additional four stories of height and
26 other incentives were not physically or economically necessary for the affordable units,
27 and indeed make the project much more expensive to build.
28

3054674.1 -6-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

17. At the Planning Commission hearing on this project on March 8, 2018, City
2 staff stated that economic feasibility could not legally be considered. Several of the

3 Planning Commissioners remarked prior to voting on the motion to approve that their
4 "hands were tied" by state law, and there was no legal basis for them to deny any of the
requested incentives.

6 THE INCENTIVES AND CONCESSIONS REQUESTED FOR THE PROJECT

16. The developer requested four "off-menu" waivers and modifications under
8 L.A.M.C. 12.22 A.25(g) for which a heightened showing of necessity was required. These

9 were:

10 (a) an off-menu request to allow a maximum Floor Area Ratio of 4.1 to in

11 lieu of the otherwise permitted 1.5 to - in the local zoning code;

12 (b) an off-menu request to allow a maximum height of 75 feet and seven
13 stories in lieu of other otherwise permitted 45 feet and three stories in the local zoning
14 code;

15 (c) an off-menu request to waive the transitional height requirements of the
16 local zoning code, which exist to prevent structures that tower over adjacent properties that
17 are zoned for single family real estate; and
18 (d) an off-menu request to modify the Project's rear-yard setback®
19 requirements.
20 THE PLANNING COMMISSION MISAPPLIED LOCAL LAW

21 17. Discussing the State Density Bonus Law in the "Project Analysis" section of
22 the report to the Planning Commission, the City Planner stated as follows:

23 Public commenters stated that the density bonus off-menu

24 requests violate State law and the City's zoning code, and that the project should seek a zone change or other legislative

25 entitlement to develop a building of the proposed scale. Members of the public have taken issue with the fact that the

26 project is requesting waivers and modifications of development standards outside the menu of incentives recognized within

27 Senate Bill 1818 (SB 1818) and Los Angeles Municipal Code Section 12.22-A,25.

28 With Senate Bill 1818 (2004), state law created a requirement

3054674.1 --
VBRIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

that local jurisdictions approve a density bonus and up to three "concessions or incentives" for projects that include defined 2 levels of affordable housing in their projects. In response to this requirement, the City of Los Angeles created an ordinance. 3 that included a menu of incentives (referred to as "on-menu" incentives) comprised of eight zoning adjustments that meet
4 the definition of concessions or incentives in state law (California Government Code Section 65915). In addition, 5 pursuant to Government Code Section 65915(e)(1), the State Density Bonus Law states that a projcct may request other 6 "waiver[s] or reduction[s] of development standards that will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a 7 development meeting the [affordable set-aside percentage] criteria of subdivision (b) at the densities or with the cc concessions or incentives permitted under [State Density , Bonus Law], creating the avenue for developments to seek
9 deviations from development standards outside the menu of concessions or incentives. The process for seeking off-menu 10 waivers and modifications has been codified under LAMC Section 12.22-A,25(g)(3), and such request(s) shall be granted 11 unless the decision-making body finds that:

12 1. The Incentive is not required in order to provide for affordable housing costs as defined in California Health and 13 Safety Code Section 50052.5, or Section 50053 for rents for the affordable units; or 14
2. The Incentive will have a Specific Adverse Impact upon 15 public health and safety or the physical environment or on any real property that is listed in the California Register of 16 Historical Resources and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate 07 avoid the Specific Adverse Impact 17 without rendering the development unaffordable to Very Low, Low and Moderate Income households. Inconsistency with the 18 zoning ordinance or general plan land use designation shall not constitule a specific, adverse impact upon the public health 19 Or safety.

20 As detailed in Finding Nos. 1 and 2 for the request herein, neither was found to be the case. Thus, there would be no
21 violation of state or local laws in approving the requested density bonus and off-menu requests for waivers and 22 modifications of development standards.
23 (Emphasis in original)

24 18. The findings made by the City were not supported by substantial evidence in
25 the record. Specifically, the City Planner composed the following finding, which the
26 Planning Commission adopted:

27 Pursuant to Section 12.22 A.25(c) of the LAMC and Government Code Section 65915, the Director shall approve a 28 density bonus and requested incentive(s) unless the director

3054674.1 -8-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

L

2 finds that the incentives do not result in identifiable and

W actual cost reductions to provide for affordable housing costs as defined in California Health and Safety Code Section 50052.5, or Section 50053 for rents for the affordable units.

The record does not contain substantial evidence that would allow the City Planning Commission to make a finding that the requested Off-Menu waivers and modifications do not result in identifiable and actual cost reduction to provide for affordable housing costs per State

7 Law. The California Health & Safety Code Sections 50052.5 and 50053 define formulas for calculating affordable housing

8 costs for Very Low, Low, and Moderate Income Households. Section 50052.5 addresses owner-occupied housing and

9 Section 50053 addresses rental households, Affordable housing costs are a calculation of residential rent or ownership pricing

10 not to exceed 25 percent gross income based on arca median income thresholds dependent on affordability levels.

11 The off-menu requests for an increase in Floor Arca Ratio,

12 increase in height and stories, waiver of transitional height requirements, and reduction in the required rear yard setback

13 are not expressed in the Menu of Incentives per LAMC Section 12.22-A,25(f) and, as such, are subject to LAMC Section

14 12.22-A,25(g)(3). Granting of the off-menu requests would result in a building design or construction efficiencies that

15 provide for affordable housing costs. The off-meny requests allow the developer to expand the building envelope so that

16 additional affordable units can be constructed and the overall space dedicated to residential uses is increased. The increased

17 building envelope also ensures that all dwelling units are of a habitable size, while providing a variety of unit types. These

18 incentives support the applicant's decision to set aside five dwelling units for Very Low Income households for 55 years

19 as well as provide an additional five units for Moderate Íncome households. (emphasis added)

20 19.

21 The findings that the height increase, reduced setback, etc. will "allow the

22 developer to expand the building envelope" and will increase the "overall space dedicated

23 to residential use" are meaningless tautologies that say nothing about whether the

24 incentives are necessary to physically or economically provide the five deed-restricted

25 affordable units. Similarly, findings that the incentives "ensures that all dwelling units are

26 of a habitable size while providing a variety of unit types" is completely without
evidentiary support in this record.

27

28 20. Neither the City's ordinance nor state law provides that an applicant who
incorporates a certain number of affordable units is entitled to build at unlimited height and

3054674.1 -9-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 bulk without any regard for applicable zoning and general plan standards. If that were the
2 standard intended by the State legislature and the City Council in enacting the density
3 bonus law and ordinance, local planning and zoning would be meaningless as to such
4 projects. The state law does not erode local democratic controls so dramatically.

5 20. The record was devoid of any financial proforma, or other substantial

6 evidence regarding the financial impacts of the requested concessions and incentives.
7 Indeed, the only evidence regarding costs was the evidence introduced by Petitioners of
8 published data indicating that construction costs escalate sharply as building heights

9 increase above two stories and again above five stories.

10 THE PROJECT'S ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT

11 21. The Planning Commission determined that an Environmental Impact Report
12 was not required for the Project because the Project is categorically exempt under Section
13 15332 of the CEQA Guidelines (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14, § 15332) as an infill development.
14 To be exempt under this Section, an infill development must, among other things:

15 -be consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable
16 general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and regulations;

17 -be within city limits on a project site of no more than five acres substantially
18 surrounded by urban uses;

19 -be without value as habitat for endangered, rare or threatened species;

20 -not result in any significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water
21 quality.

22 -be adequately served by all required utilities and public services.

23 22. The Planning Commission abused its discretion in finding that the Project
24 met the conditions for this categorical exemption. The Project is: (1) inconsistent with the
25 neighborhood protection provisions of the Wilshire Community Plan and with several
26 height, Floor Area Ratio, setback and parking standards of the Zoning Ordinance; and (2)
27 substantially surrounded by one and two-story single-family detached homes to the
28 northeast, east, southeast and west, characteristic of a low density suburban community.

3054674.1 -10-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

23. Additionally, public commenters, including Petitioners, identified unusual
2 circumstances that make use of a categorical exemption inappropriate and unlawful.
3 Specifically, the Project is uniquely situated abutting an R1 neighborhood and uniquely out
4 of proportion with the general plan and zoning limits. The Planning Commission
apparently found that unusual circumstances were present, but found that these unusual

6 circumstances did not prevent a categorical exemption because, according to the City
7 Planner, the "project will be required to adhere to any and all building code requirements
intended to reduce environmental impacts to less than significant levels." This was a

9 prejudicial abuse of discretion.

10 24. In addition to violating CEQA, the Planning Commission's disregard for the
11 Project's environmental impacts was a violation of the aforementioned state and local
12 density bonus legislation, each of which requires the refusal of all density bonuses,
13 incentives, concessions and other waivers if granting them would result in a "Specific
14  Adverse Impact upon public health and safety or the physical environment... and for
15 which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the Specific Adverse
16 Impact without rendering the development unaffordable."L.A.M.C. 12.22 A.25(g)(2)c.(i),
17 and Cal. Gov't Code § 65915(d)(1)(B).

18 25. The Project exceeds (by more than 100% in the 33" transitional zone) the
19 transitional height standards, and it encroaches upon the protected R1 airspace in violation
20 of the Community Plan goals. This constitutes a Specific Adverse Impact which deprives
21 local residents of their privacy, light, air and quiet enjoyment of their property. There are
22 numerous ways in which these impacts could have been feasibly and satisfactorily
23 mitigated without rendering the development unaffordable. These options range from
24 reducing the expensive design features, to reduction in unit sizes, elimination of the ground
25 floor retail space, and lowering the 15' ceiling height of the ground floor to match the
26 standard 10' heights of the floors above. Indeed, the fact that the developer has proposed
27 to voluntarily restrict rents on five additional units to make them affordable to moderate-
28

3054674.1 -11-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

income households constitutes an admission that the Project will have surplus revenue
2 beyond what is necessary to maintain affordability on the five very-low income units.

8 27. On or about March 16, 2018, Respondent issued a Letter of Determination
9 memorializing the Project approval. A true and correct copy of the Letter of
10 Determination is attached to this Petition as Exhibit A.

11 28. Prior to the Letter of Determination, Petitioners, among other public
12 commenters, wrote to the Planning Commission and explained that approval of the Project
13  violated state and local law and was in excess of the Planning Commission's jurisdiction.
14 A true and correct copy of Petitioners' March 5, 2018, written submission to the
15 Commission is attached to this Petition as Exhibit B and incorporated herein by reference.
16 Petitioners also attended the meeting of the Planning Commission at which the Project was
17 approved and argued against its approval.
18 29. In issuing the Letter of Determination, Respondent City has misinterpreted

19 and misapplied state and local density bonus laws (Cal. Gov't Code cop 69515; L.A.M.C.
20| 12.22 A.25), abused its discretion by failing to obtain and consider relevant financial
21 evidence, and otherwise abused its discretion.

22 30. The foregoing discussion contains illustrative, not exhaustive, examples of
23 the manner in which the oject violates state and local law, and the Letter of
24 Determination constitutes an abuse of discretion. Petitioners will amend this Petition as
25 necessary to allege additional violations and errors and fully brief the Court regarding
26 same at the appropriate juncture.
27 31. Petitioners have no plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course
28 of law other than the relief sought in this petition.

14 36. Petitioners incorporato by reference the preceding paragraphs of this petition,
15 as though fully set forth herein.

16 37. As a result of its misinterpretation of state and local density bonus
17 legislation, Respondent has proceeded without, or in excess of, its jurisdiction in issuing
18 the Letter of Determination and approving the Project.

19 38. Respondent has prejudicially abused its discretion in issuing the Letter of
20 Determination and approving the Project because it has not proceeded in the manner
21 required by law, and because the decision to approve the Project is not supported by the
22 findings, and the findings are not supported by the evidence.
23 39. An administrative writ of mandate should issue commanding Respondent to

12 because the decision to apply a categorical exemption is not supported by the findings, and
13 the findings are not supported by the evidence.

14 44. An administrative writ of mandate should issue commanding Respondent to
15 set aside the Letter of Determination and decision applying a categorical CEQA exemption
16 and approving the Project density bonus and incentives, and further commanding the
17 Planning Commission to require an environmental impact report for the Project.

FINDINGS

Density Bonus/Affordable Housing Incentives Compliance Findings

1. Pursuant to Section 12.22 A.25(c) of the LAMC and Government Code Section 65915, the Director shall approve a density bonus and requested incentive(s) unless the director finds that the Incentives do not result in identifiable and actual cost reductions to provide for affordable housing costs as defined in California Health and Safety Code Section 50052.5, or Section 50053 for rents for the affordable units.
The record does not contain substantial evidence that would allow the City Planning Commission to make a finding that the requested Off-Menu waivers and modifications do not result in identifiable and actual cost reduction to provide for affordable housing costs per State Law. The California Health & Safety Code Sections 50052.5 and 50053 define formulas for calculating affordable housing costs for Very Low, Low, and Moderate Income Households. Section 50052.5 addresses owner-occupled housing and Section 50053 addresses rental households. Affordable housing costs are a celculation of residential rent or ownership pricing not to exceed 25 percent gross income based on area median income thresholds dependent on affordability levels.

The off-menu requests for an increase in Floor Area Ratio, increase in height and stories, waiver of transitional height requirements, and reduction in the required rear yard setback are not expressed in the Menu of Incentives per LAMC Section 12.22-A,25(f) and, as such, are subject to LAMC Section 12.22-A,25(g)(3). Granting of the off-menu requests would result in a building design or construction efficiencies that provide for affordable housing costs. The off-menu requests allow the developer to expand the building envelope sO that additional affordable units can be constructed and the overall space dedicated to residential uses is increased. The increased building envelope also ensures that all dwelling units are of a habitable size, while providing a variety of unit types. These incentives support the applicant's decision to set aside five dwelling units for Very Low Income households for 55 years as well as provide an additional five units for Moderate Income households.

2, Pursuant to Section 12.22 A.25(g)(3) of the LAMC, the decision-maker shall approve a density bonus and requested waiver or modification of any development standard unless the decision-maker, based upon substantial evidence, finds that the incentive will have a specific adverse impact upon public health and safety or the physical environment, or on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources and for which there are no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avold the Specific Adverse Impact without rendering the development unaffordable to Very Low, Low and Moderate Income households. Inconsistency with the zoning ordinance or the general plan land use designation shall not constitute a specific, adverse impact upon the public health or safety.
There is no evidence that the proposed incentives will have a specific adverse impact. A "specific adverse Impact" is defined as, "a significant, quantifiable, direct and unavoidable impact, based on objective, identified written public health or safety standards, policies, or conditions as they existed on the date the application was deemed complete" (LAMC Section 12.22.A.25(b)). The project does not Involve a contributing structure in a designated Historic Preservation Overlay Zone or on the City of Los Angeles list of Historic-Cultural Monuments. It is also not located on a substandard street In a Hillside area or Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone. Finally, the project and potential impacts were analyzed in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)

Case No. CPC-2016-2203-DB F-2

Guidelines and the City's L.A. CEQA Thresholds Guide. These two documents establish guidelines and threshoids of significant impact, and provide the data for determining whether or not the impacts of a proposed project reach or exceed those thresholds. Analysis of the proposed project determined that it is Categorically Exempt from environmental review pursuant to Article 19, Class 32 of the CEQA Guidelines. Therefore, there is no substantial evidence that the proposed project will have a specific adverse impact on the physical environment, on public health and safety.
Environmental Findings

3. Environmental Finding, Pursuant to State CEQA Guidelines and City of Los Angeles CEQA Guidelines, a Categorical Exemption (ENV-2016-2204-CE) was prepared for the proposed project. Pursuant to Section 21084 of the California Public Resources Code, the above-referenced project has been determined not to have a significant effect on the environment and which shall, therefore, be exempt from the provisions of CEQA. On January 3, 2018, staff issued Categorical Exemption, Class 32 for the proposed project.
A project qualifies for a Class 32 Categorical Exemption under State CEQA Guidelines Section 15322 if it is developed on an infill development project and meets the following
criteria:

(a) The project is consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable general plan policies as well as
designation and regulations: with applicable zoning

The project site is located within the Wilshire Community Plan and designated for General Commercial land uses corresponding to the C1.5, C2, C4, RAS3, and RAS4 Zones. The site is zoned C2-1VL-O and is thus consistent with the existing land use designation. The site Is located within an "O" Oil Drilling Supplemental Use District where the drilling of oil wells or the production from the wells of oil, gases, or other hydrocarbon substances is permitted pursuant to LAMC Section 13.01. However, neither the existing or proposed use Involves oil drilling or production. As such, the provisions of said Code section do not apply to the proposed project and requested entitlement. The site is located within a City of Los Angeles Transit Priority Area; it is not located within any specific plan, community design overlay, or Interim control ordinance.
The project proposes the construction, use, and maintenance of a new, seven- story, 75-foot high, mixed-use building consisting of 54 residential dwelling units and approximately 5,651 square feet of commercial retail space. One of the stated residential goals of the Wilshire Community Plan is to "Provide a safe, secure, and high quality residential environment for all economic, age, and ethnic segments of the Wilshire Community." Objective 1-1 states, "Provide for the preservation of existing quality housing, and for the development of new housing to meet the diverse economic and physical needs of the existing residents and expected new residents in the Wilshire Community Plan Area to the year 2010." Further, policies have been established to "Provide for adequate Multiple Family residential development" (Policy 1-1.3) and "Provide for housing along mixed-use boulevards where appropriate" (Policy 1-1.4). The project will meet the residential goals, objectives, and policies of the Community Plan by developing an underutilized site along San Vicente Boulevard with new mixed-income housing. The project will not displace any existing residents from the site. Furthermore, as a mixed-use development, the project will meet the Community Pian goal and policy of encouraging strong and competitive commercial sectors by providing additional

Case No. CPC-2016-2203-DB F-3

opportunities for new commercial development and services along an established commercial boulevard.

The project is also consistent with the existing C2 zoning of the project site. The C2 Zone allows retail and residential uses as proposed. In accordance with State Density Bonus laws and LAMC Section 12.22-A,25(g)(3), the applicant requests a waiver of development standards to allow for deviations relating to floor area, height, and setbacks in exchange for providing a minimum amount of affordable housing as part of the proposed development. With approval of the waiver of development standards, the project will be consistent with the applicable zoning designation and regulations.

(b) The proposed development occurs within city limits on a project site of no more than five acres substantially surrounded by urban uses:
The project site is located in the Wilshire Community Plan area within the city limits of Los Angeles. The project site ls approximately 14,470 square feet in size (approximately 0.33 acre). In addition, the project will be located on a site previously developed with commercial uses and is surrounded by other urban uses, including single- and multi-family residential and commercial developments. Property directly north of the subject site are zoned C2-1VL-O and developed with a one-story commercial buildings. Further north, across Drexel Avenue, is an approximately 11-story medical office building. Property to the south across 5th Street is zoned C2-1VL-O and developed with a surface parking lot for an adjacent commercial building. Properties east of the subject site across the 20-foot alley are zoned R1-1-O-RFA and developed a with a grouping of single-family homes.

(c) The project site has no value as habitat for endangered, rare or threatened species:
The project site is located in a dense urban environment that is fully developed with a wide range of urban uses, structures, and pavement. The site itself is currently developed with single-story commercial structures. Existing development covers the majority of the lot. Furthermore, although shrubs and trees are located on the project site; these shrubs and trees would not afford habitat for sensitive species, and there are no protected species as defined under Los Angeles Municipal Ordinance 177,404 and as detailed in the Tree Report prepared by Harmony Gardens dated March 3, 2017 on the project site. Therefore, the proposed project site has no value as habitat for endangered, rare or threatened species.

(d) Approval of the project would not result in any significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality:
The project site is currently developed with single-story commercial structures containing neighborhood-serving commercial uses and medical offices. The project involves the construction of a new, seven-story, 75-foot high, mixed-use building consisting of 54 residential dwelling units and approximately 5,651 square feet of commercial space. All construction-related impacts would be temporary in nature, No permanent significant impacts are anticipated to occur.
Traffic. In a letter dated November 6, 2017, the Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT) concurred with the transportation analysis prepared by Gibson Transportation Consulting, dated May 31, 2017, which determined that the proposed development ls not anticipated to result in any significant traffic impacts

Case No. CPC-2016-2203-DB F-4

at the two studled intersections: Orlando Avenue and 3rd Street and Orlando Avenue / Gale Street and San Vicente Boulevard. Therefore, the project will not cause a significant or substantial increase in traffic and traffic impacts will be less- than-significant and no mitigation is required.
Noise. As discussed in the Noise and Vibration Impact Report prepared by CAJA Environmental Services, LLC, potential construction and operational noise impacis were found to be less than significant or have no impact. The project must comply with the City of Los Angeles Noise Ordinance No. 144,331 and 161,574 and any subsequent ordinances, which prohibit the emission or creation of noise beyond certain levels. The Ordinances cover both operational noise levels (i.e. post- construction), as well as any noise impact during construction. Section 41.40 of the LAMC regulates noise from demolition and construction activities. Section 41.40 prohibits construction activity (Including demolition) and repair work, where the use of any power tool, device, or equipment would disturb persons occupying sleeping quarters in any dwelling hotel, apartment, or other place of residence, between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and . 7:00 a.m. Monday through Friday, and between 6:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. on Saturdays and holidays. All such activities are also prohibited on Sundays. Sectlon 112.05 of the LAMC also specifies the maximum noise level of construction machinery that can be generated in any residential zone of the city or within 500 feet thereof. As a result of the project being required to comply with the above ordinances and regulations, it can be found that the project would not result in any significant noise impacts. All construction-related noise impacts would be less than significant and temporary in nature. No permanent significant impacts are anticipated to occur.
Air Quallty. As discussed in the Air Quality and Greenhouse Gases Impact Report prepared by CAJA Environmental Services, LLC, potential air quality impacts were found to be less than significant. The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) is the agency primarily responsible for comprehensive air pollution control in the South Coast Air Basin and reducing emissions from area and point stationary, mobile, and indirect sources. SCAQMD prepared the 2012 Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP) to meet federal and state ambient air quality standards. A significant air quality impact may occur if a project is inconsistent with the AQMP or would in some way represent a substantial hindrance to employing the pollcies or obtaining the goals of that plan. The proposed project will result in the construction of 54 residential units and 5,651 square feet of commercial space and is not expected to conflict with or obstruct the implementation of the AQMP and SCAQMD rules. Therefore, project impacts related to air quality will be less than significant.
During construction, appropriate dust control measures would be Implemented as part of the proposed project, as required by SCAQMD Rule 403 - Fugitive Dust. Specifically, Rule 403 control requirements include, but are not limited to, applying water in sufficient quantities to prevent the generation of visible dust plumes, applying soil binders to uncovered areas, reestablishing ground cover as quickly as possible, utilizing a wheel washing system to remove bulk material from tires and vehicle undercarriages before vehicles exit the Project Site, and maintaining
effective cover over exposed areas.

Best Management Practices (BMP) will be implemented that would include (but not be limited to) the following:

Case No. CPC-2016-2203-DB F-5

Unpaved demolition and construction areas shall be wetted at least three times daily during excavation and construction, and temporary dust covers shail be used to reduce emissions and meets SCAQMD Rule 403; All dirt/soil loads shall be secured by trimming, watering or other appropriate means to prevent spillage and dust; • General cantractors shall maintain and operate construction equipment to
minimize exhaust emissions; and
• Trucks shall not idle but be turned off.

All construction-related impacts would be less than significant and temporary in nature. No permanent significant impacts are anticipated to occur.
Water Quality. The project is not adjacent to any water sources and construction of the project will not create any impact to water quality, Construction activities would not involve any significant excavation near an identified water source. Furthermore, the project will comply with the City's stormwater management provisions per LAMC 64.70 and Best Management Practices (BMP) would be required during general operation of the project to ensure that storm water runoff meets the established water quality standards and waste discharge requirements. Therefore, development of the proposed project would not degrade the quality of stormwater runoff from the site and would not result in any significant effects
relating to water quality,

(e) The site can be adequately served by all required utilities and public services:

The project would be located in an existing highly urban area served by existing public utilities and services. A substantial increase in demand for services or utilities would not be anticipated with implementation of the proposed project. The City of Los Angeles provides water, sewer, and solid waste collection services to the existing residential buildings and would continue to provide these services to the proposed project. Other services, including gas and electricity, would also continue to be provided to the proposed project by existing service providers.
The site is currently and adequately served by the City's Department of Water and Power, the City's Bureau of Sanitation, the Southern California (SoCal) Gas Company, the Los Angeles Police Department (Wilshire Division), the Los Angeles Fire Department (South Bureau), Los Angeles Unified School District, Los Angeles Public Library, and other public services. The proposed project would not require the expansion of public services (fire, police, schools, parks, and librarles) or existing water, wastewater or stormwater drainage facilities; and the City would have sufficient water supplies and landfill capacity for the proposed project. Therefore, the site can be adequately served by all required utilities and public
services.

EXCEPTIONS TO CATEGORICAL EXEMPTIONS
Planning staff evaluated the exceptions to the use of Categorical Exemptions for the proposed ordinance listed in "CEQA Guidelines" Section 15300.2 and determined that none of the exceptions apply to the proposed project:

Case No. CPC-2016-2203-DB F-6

(a) Location. Classes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 11 are qualified by consideration of where the project is to be located - a project that is ordinarily insignificant in its impact on the environment may in a particularly sensitive environment be significant. Therefore, these classes are considered to apply all instances,
except where the project may impact on an environmental resource of hazardous or critical concern where designated, precisely mapped, and officially adopted pursuant to law by federal, state, or local agencies.
The project qualifies for a Class 32 Categorical Exemption. Because the proposed
Project is not defined as a Class 3, 4, 5, 6 or 11 project, this exception is
inapplicable. The project site is not located in a particularly sensitive environment
and would not be located on a site containing wetlands, endangered species, or wildlife habitats The requested project will not impact an environmental resource of hazardous or critical concern where designated, precisely mapped, and officially
adopted pursuant to law by federal, state, or local agencies.

(b) Cumulative Impact. All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the cumulative Impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is significant.
The proposed project involves the construction, use, and maintenance of a new, seven-story, 75-foot high, mixed-use building consisting of 54 residential dwelling units and approximately 5,651 square feet of commercial space. The project will set aside five units (11 percent of the base density) for Very Low Income
Households and will set aside an additional five units for Moderate Income
Households. The project will provide 79 automobile parking spaces located within three subterranean parking levels. Under LAMC Section 12.22-A,25, the requested entitlement for a Density Bonus allows for the applicant to request certain
deviations from the code (in this case, deviations relating to density, parking, floor area, height, and setbacks) in exchange for providing a minimum amount of affordable housing as part of the proposed development, subject to certain
findings.

The development of the project site with 54 dwelling units is consistent with the zone and land use designation of the site, as designated by the Wilshire Community Plan, and as permitted by the City's Density Bonus Ordinance (LAMC Section 12.22-A,25). A successive project of the same type and nature would reflect a development that is consistent with the underlying land use designation and Los Angeles Municipal Code. Any such project would be subject to Regulatory Compllance Measures (RCMs), which require compliance with the City of Los Angeles Noise Ordinance; pollutant discharge, building code and regulated construction methods, dewatering, stormwater mitigations; and Best Management
Practices for stormwater runoff. These RCMs will mitigate environmental impacts
for an individual project and not create a cumulative impact.

Case No. CPC-2016-2203-DB F-7

(c) Significant Effect. A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant
effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances.

The project proposes the construction of a seven story, approximately 59,403
square-foot building in a full developed urban setting. The project will be required to adhere to any and all building code requirements intended to reduce environmental impacts to less than significant levels. Thus, the project will not result in activity that will have a significant effect on the environment due to
unusual circumstances,

(d) Scenic Highways. A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may result in damage to scenic resources, including but not limited to,
trees, historic bulldings, rock outcroppings, or similar resources, within a highway officially designated as a state scenic highway. This does not apply to improvements which are required as mitigation by an adopted negative
declaration or certified EIR.

According to the California Scenic Highway Mapping System, the project site is not located on or near a portion of a highway that is either eligible or officially designated as a state scenic highway. As such, this exception does not apply to
the proposed project.

(e) Hazardous Waste Sites. A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project located on a site which is included on any list compiled pursuant to
Section 65962.5 of the Government Code.

The project site is not located within a Methane Zone or Methane Buffer Zone, nor is it located in a Hazardous Waste/Border Zone Properties area as designated by
the City of Los Angeles. There are no oils, elevators, in-ground hydrologic systems, monitoring or water supply wells, or above- or below-ground storage tanks, or potentially fluid-filled electrical equipment on or immediately adjacent to the project site. No industrial wastewater is generated on the project site and sanitary wastewater is discharged to the City Bureau of Sanitation.
Western Environmental Engineers Co. performed a Phase Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) in general conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM E 1527-13 for the subject property. Based on the findings of the Phase I ESA, evidence of recognized environmental conditions in connection with the subject property have not been identified.

(f) Historical Resources. A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a
historical resource.

Development of the project would involve the demolition of an existing commercial buildings and construction of a new mixed-use development containing 54 residential dwelling units and 5,651 square feet of commercial space. The existing building is not historic, there are no nationally or locally designated historic

Case No. CPC-2016-2203-DB F-8

buildings on the project site, and the project is not located in a historic district. As
such, the project will have no impact to historic resources.

CONCLUSION

Therefore, based on the facts herein, it can be found that the project meets the qualifications of the Class 32 Categorical Exemption and the Categorical Exemption reflects the Lead Agency's independent judgment and analysis. The records upon which this decision is based are with the Environmental Review Section of the Planning Department in Room 750, 200 North Spring Street.

4. Flood Insurance. The National Flood Insurance Program rate maps, which are a part of the Flood Hazard Management Specific Plan adopted by the City Council by Ordinance No. 172,081, have been reviewed and it has been determined that this project is located in Zone X, areas determined to be outside the 500-year flood plain.

Re: Case No. CPC-2016-2203-DB (488-498 South San Vicente Boulevard)
Agenda Item # 9 on March 8,2018 Agenda

Dear Commissioners,

This firm is legal counsel for Scott Schreiber and Jessica Sabbah-Mani, co-owners and residents of the
single-family home at 6706 Drexel Avenue, approximately 100' east of the subject property. On behalf
of my clients, I am submitting these objections and hereby request that the discretionary density bonus
application before you be denied.
This case presents an egregious and illegal misuse of the density bonus ordinance to attempt to insert a
towering 7-story luxury apartment building immediately adjacent to a quiet R1 neighborhood. Along
with several other legal defects outlined below, the application misinterprets and perverts the use of "off-menu concessions and incentives" to eviscerate all applicable Community Plan and zoning controls.
The absurd result sought by the applicant is that a 35% density bonus would end up increasing the
allowable height of the building by almost 75% (from 45 feet to 75 feet) and increasing the F.A.R. by
more than 200% (from 1.5 to 4.1). While the five deed-restricted affordable units (out of 54 total units)
may provide a laudable social benefit, they do not entitle the developer a free pass to disregard all
zoning and development standards designed to insure compatibility with the adjacent R1 neighborhood.

1. THE REQUESTED OFF-MENU CONCESSIONS AND INCENTIVES ARE NOT LAWFUL OR
WARRANTED

The flawed rationale behind this application seems to be a mistaken assumption that there is effectively
no limit to "off-menu" concessions and incentives. That assumption is expressly contrary to state law,
which limits all density bonus concessions and incentives only to those "that result in identiflable and actual cost reductions to provide for . rents for the targeted units to be set as specifled ... ." (Cal.
Gov't Code §65915(k).) In other words, there must be a well-documented showing that each concession
or incentive is necessary to make the project pencil out financially with the affordable units.

This requirement to show financial necessity applies equally under the City's Density Bonus Ordinance, the express purpose of which is to "implement State Density Bonus requirements, as set forth in
California Government Code Sections 65915 [et seq.]." (LAMC 12.22 A.25(a).)

4348 Hayman Avenue
La Cañada Flintridge, CA 91011

The City's application requirements emphasize the need for financial justification of concessions and
incentives, Under the City's ordinance, a developer applying for an off-menu concession or incentive
need only submit two things, one being a completed application form and the other being financial
justification for the concession and incentive:

"The request [for off-menu concessions and incentives] shall be made on a form provided by the
Department of City Planning, accompanied by applicable fees, and shall include a pro forma or
other documentation to show that the waiver or modification of any development standard(s)
are needed in order to make the Restricted Affordable Units economically feasible." (LAMC
12.22 A.25(g)(3)(i)a. (emphasis added).)

This showing of financial justification is not a mere formality of the application process, but rather is the
very heart of the matter in this case. The only discretionary decision before you at the upcoming
hearing is whether or not to approve the requested off-menu concessions and incentives along with the
density bonus. And according to your ordinance, the only criteria for your exercise of that discretion are
whether the incentive or concession is (i) "required in order to provide for affordable ... rents for the
affordable units"; or (Il) (as discussed further below) the incentive or concession "will have a Specific
Adverse Impact upon public health and safety or the physical environment or on any [registered historic
resourcel and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the Specific
Adverse Impact without rendering the development unaffordable to Very Low, Low and Moderate
Income households." (LAMC 12.22 A,25(g)(3)(i)c., incorporating by reference Subparagraph (g)(2)(i)c.
(emphasis added).)

Given the centrality of such financial considerations, it is quite surprising that the 491-page agenda
package for the upcoming hearing contains no financial proforma or documentation or analysis
whatsoever concerning the financial necessity for the requested concessions and incentives. The
agenda materials include no information, for example, on whether any of the requested code waivers
even meets the state law criteria for concessions that can lawfully be granted as part of a density bonus,
namely that they provide "identifiable and actual cost reductions" that make the affordable rents
financially feasible. Indeed, it is doubtful that any of the requested incentives actually reduces costs.
Does an increase in allowable building height reduce costs? To the contrary, published data indicates
that construction costs escalate sharply as building heights increase above two stories, and again over
five stories, thereby requiring much higher rents for the project to pencil financially,'
Similarly, no data or analysis suggests that the reduction in yards and setbacks provides any reduction in cost or is necessary to achieve the affordable rents required for five of the 54 total units. Again,
construction data cited in the footnote along with common sense would suggest that a smaller building
with smaller units would generally be more affordable than a larger building with larger units. Floor plans for this project show that some of the units exceed 1,300 s.f., which is larger even than many
detached single-family homes in this City. Undoubtedly costs could be brought down by reducing the
size of some or all of the units, and this would not only reduce the number of concessions and incentives
(if any) required for the project but also reduce the impacts of this outsized project on its R1 neighbors.

1 #Under current market conditions, for example, development of garden apartments (two-story structures with
surface parking) require apartment rents of at least $1.00-$1.20 per square foot. Mid-rise apartment construction (five story buildings with structured parking) require rents in the $1.70-$2.10 per square foot range. And high-rise
constructlon (greater than 5 stories, often requiring steel construction and underground parking) require rents in the $2.70-$2.90 per square foot range." Density at Any Cost (Mildner 2014), Center for Real Estate, Portland State
University, https://www.pdx.edu/realestate/sites/www.pdx.edu.realestate/files/Mildner UGR article 3.pdf

2

In fact, of all the requested incentives and concessions, only the reduction in required parking qualifies as a cost-reducing measure. Even the parking incentive, however, fails to meet the second prong of the legal test, namely whether the incentive is necessary to provide the five very-low income units.

Furthermore, the plans and renderings show the project includes many expensive design features and
finishes, such as concrete floors, varying floorplate sizes, floor to ceiling plate glass, a solid cantilevered roof canopy, and other features that substantially increase construction costs. It will be impossible to
show that the requested additional height and bulk of the building are necessary to make the five rent-
restricted units affordable, given such expensive design choices were made for the building.

Lastly, the fact that the applicant has proposed to voluntarily restrict rents on five additional units to make them affordable to moderate-income households constitutes an admission that the project will
have surplus revenue beyond what is necessary to maintain affordability on the five very-low income
units. Moderate-income rental units do not qualify for a density bonus under state law or the City's
ordinance, and consequently the proposed project conditions do not require them to be deed restricted. They are purely voluntary and do not trigger any legal right to a concession or incentive. However
beneficial and laudable these moderate-income units may be, the applicant's willingness to voluntarily
reduce rents to moderate-income levels on five units means that the financial proforma must have
additional "fat" beyond that needed to support very-low income rents an the density bonus units.

This case, as currently presented, exemplifles the dangerous precedent that would be created where
the financial justification requirement is ignored. As defined In state law, a "concession or incentive" must (I) reduce costs; and (1l) be necessary to provide for the deed-restricted rents. Failure by the City
to enforce those criteria opens the barn door wide to virtually unlimited height and bulk. If you could approve 75' and seven storles in a zone that allows only 45, what would prevent the next developer from proposing 95' and nine stories? To take it to the extreme, what would prevent approval of a building design on this site with 54 units bullt with only one unit per floor, to a helght of 540 feet? Please let me know what would prevent this under the applicant's skewed Interpretation of what
qualifies as an off-menu incentive.

Given that the financial analysis -- which by law must the central focus of your decision -- has not been included in the agenda material and has not been given to the public in advance with adequate time for review, the applicant and City staff have therefore not met the state law and City ordinance requirements, and have not provided basic due process for even bringing this matter forward for your
consideration. Any approval of the requested concessions and incentives at this week's hearing will be
utterly without foundation and therefore void.

2. THE REQUESTED INCENTIVES AND CONCESSIONS WILL HAVE SPECIFIC ADVERSE IMPACTS
UPON PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY AND THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

A second and independent basis for denying the requested concessions and incentives is that they will
"will have a Specific Adverse Impact upon public health and safety or the physical environment or on any [registered historic resource]." (LAMC 12.22 A.25(g)(3)(i)c., incorporating by reference
Subparagraph (g)(2)(i)c.)

As defined in the LAMC, a "Specific Adverse Impact" means: "a significant, quantifiable, direct, and unavoidable impact, based on objective, identified written public health or safety standards, policies, or conditions as they existed on the date the application was deemed complete." (LAMC 12.22 A.25(b).)

3

Two of the most obvious objective, written health and safety standards and policies that will be violated by this project with resulting direct impact on my clients will be: (I) the neighborhood protection policies of the Wilshire Community Plan; and (il) the transitional height rules in the Zoning Ordinance designed
to protect adjacent R1 neighborhoods.

As part of the City's General Plan, the Wilshire Community Plan establishes goals, objectives and policies
specifically tailored to the needs of this portion of the City. One of the "three fundamental premises" of the Community plan with respect to residential development is as follows: "A general limitation of residential densities in various neighborhoods to the prevailing existing density of development within these neighborhoods." (Community Plan, p. IlI-1.) With respect to residential development, the Plan
establishes a wide range of housing densities for specific parcels and neighborhoods. Policy 1-1.1,of the Community Plan specifically provides: "Protect existing stable single family and low density residential neighborhoods from encroachment by higher density residential uses and other uses that are
incompatible as to scale and character, or would otherwise diminish quality of life."

Consistent with the Community Plan policies for protection of low-density neighborhoods, the Zoning
Ordinance (LAMC 12.21.1 A) establishes a specific transitional height standard applicable to
developments in a Cor M zone abutting an R1 zone or other low-density neighborhood, as follows:

Distance from R1 Zone Helght Limit
to 49 feet 25 feet
50 to 99 feet 33 feet
100 to 199 feet 61 feet

The subject property is located in a "C" is zone and is located only 20 feet from the R1 zone where my
clients reside, Almost all of the proposed seven-story building lies within 100 feet of the R1 Zone, and
would therefore be limited to at most 33-feet tall under the transitional height standard. The current
agenda report presents a misleading picture of the transitional height requirement in Figure 4, which |
have marked up to show the transitional height limit (red) and the 45' 1VL height district limit (blue):
2P

4vh g
H5 E LMLE

Gh 6E

Figure 4. Transitional Height Diagram

Nothing in the lengthy agenda report suggests that the project, likely even with 54 units, could not be built within the transitional height envelope (or something close to it) through a combination of design changes that could include, among others, reduction in unit sizes, elimination of the ground floor retail space, and lowering the 15' ceiling height of the ground floor to match the standard 10' heights of the floors above.

The chief goal and essence of good zoning and planning is to regulate the size, height and location of
uses so as to promote the harmonious interaction of uses and minimize adverse environmental impacts.
As Justice Sutherland observed in the most famous and seminal zoning case of all time, Village of Euclid
v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U.S. 365 (1926), the fundamental legal justification for zoning laws is the is
protection of neighboring properties:

"No serious difference of opinion exists in respect of the validity of laws and regulations fixing
the height of buildings within reasonable limits, the character of materials and methods of construction, and the adjoining area which must be left open in order to minimize the danger of
fire or collapse, the evils of over-crowding, and the like, and excluding from residential sections
offensive trades, industries, and structures likely to create nuisances." (272 U.S. at 388,
emphasis added.)

The proposed project exceeds (by more than 100% in the 33' transitional zone) the transitional height
standards, and it encroaches upon the protected R1 airspace in violation of the Community Plan goals.
This constitutes a Specific Adverse Impact which deprives my clients and their neighbors of their privacy,
light, air and quiet enjoyment of their property. This impact cannot be satisfactorily mitigated by
limiting hours for the roof terrace, or by the minor terracing back of upper floors as shown in Figure 4,
which eliminates less than a third of the total building mass above the applicable zoning limits. As the
agenda report acknowledges (p. A-9), although there are other tall buildings in the general vicinity, most
notably the Goodson Cedar Sinai medical office tower, "the project site is relatively unique in its proximity to single-family uses." Indeed, the proposed project is only half the distance from my client's
residence as the Goodson tower, and there is a substantial difference in terms of loss of privacy
between having your back yard and bedroom overlooked on the one hand, by a primarily daytime use
such as a medical office building, and, on the other hand, an apartment tower with balconies and
evening activities going on day and night.

These conditions clearly establish a Significant Adverse Impact that supports denial of the proposed
concessions and incentives.

3. A CLASS 32 CEQA EXEMPTION IS NOT APPLICABLE TO THIS PROJECT

For CEQA clearance, the project is relying on a Class 32 categorical exemption applicable to certain
urban infill projects. No Class 32 exemption or other CEQA exemption applies to this case, however,
because, among other things:

a) The Class 32 exemption applies only if the project is consistent with "all applicable general plan
policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and regulations." (State CEQA Guidelines
§15332(a).) As discussed above, the project is not consistent with the neighborhood protection
provisions of the Wilshire Community Pian and with several height, F.A.R., setback and parking
standards of the Zoning Ordinance.

b) Another requirement for use of the Class 32 exemption is that the subject property be
"substantially surrounded by urban uses", (State CEQA Guidelines §15332(b).) In this case, the

5

site is substantially surrounded by one and two-story single-family detached homes to the NE,
East, SE and West (at the corner of N. Hamilton and San Vicente) characteristic of a low density
suburban community,

c) A Class 32 exemption or other categorical exemption may not be used where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to
unusual circumstances. (State CEQA Guidelines 515300.2.) Unusual circumstances exist "where
the circumstances of a particular project (i) differ from the general circumstances of the projects
covered by a particularized categorical exemption, and (Ii) those circumstances create an
environmental risk that does not exist for the general class of exempt projects." (Azusa Land
Reclamation Co. v. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster (52 Cal.App.4th 1165, 1207.) As
discussed above, the project is uniquely situated abutting an R1 neighborhood and uniquely out
of proportion with the general plan and zoning limits (e.g, more than twice the 33' transitional
height limit and more than twice the 1.5 F.A.R. limit), and these extreme circumstances create a
Specific Adverse Impact on my clients and their neighbors,

For all the foregoing reasons, the proposed density bonus concessions and incentives should be denled,
and the Commission should make appropriate denial findings incorporating the content of this letter,
citing the project's Specific Adverse Impacts, the unlawful nature of the requested concessions or
incentives, the lack of any information concerning cost reduction or necessity for the concessions, and
the need for additional CEQA revlew.

Sincerely,

Alnedes

STIPULATION - EARLY ORGANIZATIONAL MEETING CASE NUMBER:

This stipulation is intended to encourage cooperation among the parties at an early stage in the litigation and to assist the parties in efficient case resolution.
The parties agree that:

1. The parties commit to conduct an initial conference (in-person or via teleconference or via videoconference) within 15 days from the date this stipulation is signed, to discuss and consider whether there can be agreement on the following:

a. Are motions to challenge the pleadings necessary? If the issue can be resolved by amendment as of right, or if the Court would allow leave to amend, could an amended complaint resolve most or all of the issues a demurrer might otherwise raise? If so, the parties agree to work through pleading issues SO that a demurrer need only raise issues they cannot resolve. Is the issue that the defendant seeks to raise amenable to resolution on demurrer, or would some other type of motion be preferable? Could a voluntary targeted exchange of documents or information by any party cure an uncertainty in the pleadings?

b. Initial mutual exchanges of documents at the "core" of the litigation. (For example, in an employment case, the employment records, personnel file and documents relating to the conduct in question could be considered "core." In a personal injury case, an incident or police report, medical records, and repair or maintenance récords could be considered "core.");

C. Exchange of names and contact information of witnesses;

d. Any insurance agreement that may be available to satisfy part or all of a judgment, or to indemnify or reimburse for payments made to satisfy a judgment;

e. Exchange of any other information that might be helpful to facilitate understanding, handling, or resolution of the case in a manner that preserves objections or privileges by agreement;

f Controlling issues of law that, if resolved early, will promote efficiency and economy in other phases of the case. Also, when and how such issues can be presented to the Court;

g Whether or when the case should be scheduled with a settlement officer, what discovery or court ruling on legal issues is reasonably required to make settlement discussions meaningful, and whether the parties wish to use a sitting judge or a private imediator or other options as

STIPULATION AND ORDER - MOTIONS IN LIMINE CASE NUMBER:

This stipulation is intended to provide fast and informal resolution of evidentiary issues through diligent efforts to define and discuss such issues and limit paperwork.

The parties agree that:
1. At least days before the final status conference, each party will provide all other parties with a list containing a one paragraph explanation of each proposed motion in limine. Each one paragraph explanation must identify the substance of a single proposed motion in limine and the grounds for the proposed motion.
2. The parties thereafter will meet and confer, either in person or via teleconference or
videoconference, concerning all proposed motions in limine. In that meet and confer, the parties will determine:

a. Whether the parties can stipulate to any of the proposed motions. If the parties so stipulate, they may file a stipulation and proposed order with the Court.
b. Whether any of the proposed motions can be briefed and submitted by means of a short joint statement of issues. For each motion which can be addressed by a short
joint statement of issues, a short joint statement of issues must be filed with the Court 10 days prior to the final status conference. Each side's portion of the short joint statement of issues may not exceed three pages. The parties will meet and confer to
agree on a date and manner for exchanging the parties' respective portions of the short joint statement of issues and the process for filing the short joint statement of
issues.

3. All proposed motions in limine that are not either the subject of a stipulation or briefed via
a short joint statement of issues will be briefed and filed in accordance with the California Rules of Court and the Los Angeles Superior Court Rules.

§ COURT
ezans ANOF LOS

ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR)
INFORMATION PACKET

The person who files a civil lawsuit (plaintiff) must include the ADR information
Packet with the complaint when serving the defendant. Cross-complainants must
serve the ADR Information Packet on any new parties named to the action
together with the cross-complaint.
There are a number of ways to resolve civil disputes without having to sue
someone. These alternatives to a lawsuit are known as alternative dispute
resolution (ADR).
In ADR, trained, impartial persons decide disputes or help parties decide disputes
themselves. These persons are called neutrals. For example, in mediations, the
neutral is the mediator. Neutrals normally are chosen by the disputing parties or by
the court. Neutrals can help resolve disputes without having to go to court.

LAADR 005 (Rev. 03/17)
LASC Adopted 10-03
Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.221

Advantages of ADR

9 Often faster than going to trial
Often less expensive, saving the litigants court costs, attorney's fees and expert fees.
May permit more participation, allowing parties to have more control over the outcome.
Allows for flexibility in choice of ADR processes and resolution of the dispute.
Fosters cooperation by allowing parties to work together with the neutral to resolve the dispute and
mutually agree to remedy. There are fewer, if any, court appearances. Because ADR can be faster and save money, it can reduce
stress.

Disadvantages of ADR - ADR may not be suitable for every dispute.
If ADR is binding, the parties normally give up most court protections, including a decision by a judge or jury under formal rules of evidence and procedure, and review for legal error by an appellate court. ADR may not be effective if it takes place before the parties have sufficient information to resolve the
dispute.
The neutral may charge a fee for his or her services.
If the dispute is not resolved through ADR, the parties may then have to face the usual and traditional
costs of trial, such as attorney's fees and expert fees.

The Most Common Types of ADR

Mediation

In mediation, a neutral (the mediator) assists the parties in reaching a mutually acceptable resolution of their dispute. Unlike lawsuits or some other types of ADR, the parties, rather than the mediator,
decide how the dispute is to is be resolved.

Mediation is particularly effective when the parties have a continuing relationship, like a neighbors or business people. Mediation is also very effective where personal feelings are
getting in the way of a resolution. This is because mediation normally gives the parties a chance
to express their feelings and find out how the other sees things.

Mediation may not be effective when one party is unwilling to cooperate or compromise or
when one of the a parties has a significant advantage in power over the other. Therefore, it may not be a good choice if the parties have a history of abuse or victimization.

N Arbitration

In arbitration, a neutral person called an "arbitrator" hears arguments and evidence from each
side and then decides the outcome of the dispute. Arbitration is typically less formal than a trial, and the rules of evidence may be relaxed. Arbitration may be either "binding" or "non- binding." Binding arbitration means the parties waive their right to a trial and agree to accept the arbitrator's decision as final. Non-binding arbitration means that the parties are free to
request a trial if they reject the arbitrator's decision.

Arbitration is best for cases where the parties want another person to decide the outcome of
their dispute for them but would like to avoid the formality, time, and expense of a trial. It may
also be appropriate for complex matters where the parties want a decision-maker who has
training or experience in the subject matter of the dispute.

Mandatory Settlement Conference (MSC)

Settlement Conferences are appropriate in any case where settlement is an option. is
Mandatory Settlement Conferences are ordered by the Court and are often held near the date
a case is set for trial. The parties and their attorneys meet with a judge who devotes his or her
time exclusively to preside over the MSC. The judge does not make a decision in the case but assists the parties in evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the case and in negotiating a
settlement.

The Los Angeles Superior Court Mandatory Settlement Conference (MSC) program is free of charge and staffed by experienced sitting civil judges who devote their time exclusively to presiding over MSCs. The judges participating in the judicial MSC program and their locations are identified in the List of Settlement Officers found on the Los Angeles Superior Court website
at http://www.lacourt.org/.This program is available in general jurisdiction cases with
represented parties from independent calendar (IC) and Central Civil West (CCW) courtrooms.
in addition, on an ad hoc basis, personal injury cases may be referred to the program on the eve of trial by the personal injury master calendar courts in the Stanley Mosk Courthouse or the
asbestos calendar court in CCW.

In order to access the Los Angeles Superior Court MSC Program the judge in the IC courtroom, the CCW Courtroom or the personal injury master calendar courtroom must refer the parties to
the program. Further, all parties must complete the information requested in the Settlement
Conference Intake Form and email the completed form to mscdept18@lacourt.org.
