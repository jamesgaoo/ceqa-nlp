22 Petitioner SCALE hereby alleges as follows:
23 INTRODUCTION

24 1. Petitioner SCALE brings this action to challenge the decision by Respondent CITY OF
25 TEMECULA ("Temecula") approving the Altair Specific Plan project ("Project"), including a
26 General Plan Amendment, a Specific Plan, a Tentative Tract Map, and a Development Agreement
27 (Planning Application Nos. PA14-0158, PA14-0159, PA14-0160 and PA14-0161), as well as the
28 adoption of a resolution certifying an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") and adopting Findings of

Verified Petitión for Writ of Mandate (SCALE v. City of Temecula [Ambient Communities, LLC])

Fact, a Statement of Overriding Considerations, and a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program

2 for the Project pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (State Clearinghouse No.

3 2014111029).

4 2. Temecula's decision approving the Project violates the California Environmental

5 Quality Act, Public Resources Code §§ 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"), as well as the "Guidelines for

6 Implementation of the California Environmental Quality Act," California Code of Regulations, Title

7 14, §§ 15000 et seq. ("CEQA Guidelines") because the Final EIR fails to, among other things,

8 properly disclose, analyze and mitigate fire hazard impacts and impacts to biological resources, water

9 supplies and traffic conditions occurring on and in proximity to the Project site.

10 3. Temecula's certification of an EIR which is legally deficient with respect to fire hazard
11 impacts and impacts to biological resources, water supplies and traffic conditions damages SCALE

12 and the general public by causing environmental harm which was neither properly disclosed, properly
13 analyzed, nor adequately mitigated.

14 4. SCALE seeks this Court's peremptory writ of mandate directing Temecula to vacate
15 and set aside its decision approving the Project, and remanding the Project to Temecula for
16 reconsideration after preparation and certification of a new, legally sufficient EIR.
17 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

18 5. The Court has jurisdiction of this matter pursuant to Public Resources Code $ 21167.
19 6. Venue of this action is proper in the Riverside County Superior Court pursuant to Code
20 of Civil Procedure § 394 because Temecula is a local agency situated in the County of Riverside.
21 Venue of this action is proper in the Riverside Historic Courthouse pursuant to the local Complex
22 Litigation Rules of Riverside County requiring that all cases brought under CEQA are to be heard in
23 either Departments 05 or 10 of the Riverside Historic Courthouse.

24 PARTIES

25 7. Petitioner SCALE is an unincorporated association composed of members who are

26 citizens of the state of California residing in the communities of Lake Elsinore, Mead Valley,
27 Menifee, Murrieta, Perris, Temecula, Tustin and Wildomar. Members of SCALE are concerned with

28 land use, planning and environmental issues affecting their communities and the region.

15 THE PROJECT

16 11. In November of 2014, Ambient Communities submitted the Project consisting of a
17 General Plan Amendment (PA14-0158), a Specific Plan (PA14-0159), a Tentative Tract Map (PA14-
18 0160), and a Development Agreement (PA14-0161).

19 12. The Project permits development of up to 1,750 residential units, commercial,
20 civic/institutional uses, elementary school, parks, and open space within a 270-acre area in the
21 southwesterly portion of the City of Temecula, west of what is commonly known as Temecula Old
22 Town. The proposed Project will be built from north to south in four main phases; 1) north phase, 2)
23 central phase, 3) south phase, and 4) civic phase.

24 13. The Project site consists of 16 parcels (Assessor Parcel Nos. 922-210-049, 940-310-

25 013, 940-310-015, 940-310-016, 940-310-044 through 940-310-048, and 940-320-001 through 940-

26 320-007). All of the aforementioned land parcels are located within the Murrieta Creck and Santa
27 Rosa Plateau Subunits of the Riverside County Multi-Species Habitat Conservation Plan (MSHCP)
28 Southwest Area Plan.

3

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate (SCALE v. Citv of Temecula [Ambient Communities. IT.C.N

14. The proposed Project would additionally construct a major traffic arterial, the Western

2 Bypass, which would link two existing roadways, Temecula Parkway with Diaz Road. The Project

3 also proposes to widen nearby Vincent Moraga Road.

4 ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS

5 15. Temecula determined that an EIR would be required for the proposed Project and

6 issued an Initial Study/Notice of Preparation on November 13, 2014. The public review period

7 extended through December 15, 2014.

8 16. On December 3, 2014, Temecula sponsored a public scoping meeting to obtain
9 comments from interested parties as to the scope of a Draft EIR.

10 17. On May 2, 2016, Temecula released for public review the Draft EIR for the Project.
11 Following a 45-day review period, the public review and comment period on the Draft EIR closed on

12 June 17, 2016. Twenty-six comment letters were received on the proposed Project.
13 18. On February 14, 2017, the Temecula City Council conducted a public hearing resulting
14 from a request by City staff for City Council direction on future uses and/or activities on the 55-acre

15 South Parcel of the Project. The City Council announced during the public hearing that it intended to
16 designate the South Parcel for development as an "interpretive center" with an option to develop the
17 South Parcel with a more intensive use such as a hospital, college, or other civic usage in the event a
18 lawsuit was later filed against the Project.

19 19. On November 3, 2017, Temecula released its Final EIR.

20 20. On November 15, 2017, the Temecula Planning Commission conducted a public
21 hearing on the Project.

22 21. On November 29, 2017, a meeting was held between the Temecula Mayor, Planning
23 Staff, a representative for the Project applicant, and representatives of state and federal Wildlife
24 Agencies and the Regional Conservation Agency regarding the South Parcel.
25 22. On December 7, 2017, the Regional Conservation Agency (RCA) submitted a letter
26 stating it had previously found that the Project was inconsistent with the MSHCP, but that if 12 listed
27 measures were incorporated as conditions of approval for the Project, then the RCA would find the
28 Project consistent with the MSHCP. Although the 12 listed measures in the December 7, 2017 RCA
4

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate (SCALE v. City of Temecula [Ambient Communities. LLCI)

Letter included additional measures not contained in the Final EIR, the December 7, 2017 Letter did

2 not require Temecula or Ambient Communities to comply fully with the MSHCP's Criteria
Refinement process, a significant aspect of the regional environmental preservation plan.

4 23. On December 8, 2017, Temecula posted a document titled "Addition to Final EIR."

5 Temecula did not release revised version of the Final EIR as would have been required by CEQA,

6 nor did the City indicate which portions, if any, of the Final EIR were superseded by the "Addition to

7 the Final EIR."

8 24. On December 12, 2017, the Temecula City Council conducted a public hearing on the

9 proposed Project, voting 4 to to approve the Project.

10 25. Also on December 12, 2017, Ambient Community's consultant Helix Environmental
11 Planning finalized a "Functional Equivalency Analysis for the Western Bypass and Altair Specific
12 Plan Amendment Development Footprint and approximately 66 acres of land proposed for
13 conservation on Assessor Parcel Numbers 918-080-008 and 918-080-009 under the Multiple Species
14 Habitat Conservation Plan and Standards for an Additional 100 Acres" (the "FEA"). The FEA was not
15 released to the public until after Temecula's approval of the Project earlier the same day.
16 26. On December 13, 2017, Temecula filed a Notice of Determination for the Project with
17 the Riverside County Clerk.

18 CEQA LITIGATION NOTICES

19 27. SCALE has performed the condition precedent to the filing of this lawsuit in
20 compliance with Public Resources Code § 21167.5 by providing Temecula with notice of this action
21 prior to the filing of this pleading, and by filing proof of service of the same concurrently with the
22 filing of this Petition. (A copy of that notice is attached hereto as Exhibit "A.")
23 28. Concurrently with the filing of this action, in compliance with Public Resources Code
24 § 21167.6, SCALE has filed a request that Temecula prepare the record of proceedings relating to the
25 Project subject of this action. That request, together with this Petition, will be served personally upon
26 Temecula not later than 10 business days from the date this action is filed. SCALE reserves the right
27 to elect to prepare the record of proceedings under Public Resources Code § 21167.6(b)(2) and within
28 the time limit specified in Public Resources Code § 21167.6(b)(1).
5

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate (SCALE v. City of Temecula [Ambient Communities, LLCI)

29. SCALE will perform the condition precedent to the granting of temporary or
2 permanent relief in this lawsuit in compliance with Public Resources Code § 21167.7 and Code of
3 Civil Procedure § 388 by providing the California Attorney General with a copy a of this pleading
4 within 10 days after the filing thereof.

5 30. Not later than 20 business days following service of the petition on Temecula, SCALE

6 will serve each Real Party in Interest, Project Applicants Ambient and West Village with a copy of
7 this Petition by personal service, mail, facsimile, or any other method permitted by law, pursuant to

8 Public Resources Code § 21167.6.5(a).
9 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

10 31. SCALE has complied with the applicable statute of limitations set forth under

11 subdivision (c) of Public Resources Code § 21167, and subdivision (c)(1) of CEQA Guidelines §
12 15112. Temecula has approved an EIR, followed by the filing of a Notice of Determination for the
13 Project with the Riverside County Clerk on December 13, 2017. The filing of this proceeding within
14 30 days following Temecula's filing of the Notice of Determination was accomplished in timely
15 fashion pursuant to the applicable statute of limitations.
16 INTERESTS OF PETITIONER

17 32. SCALE has standing as a beneficially interested party to assert the claims being raised
18 in this action because SCALE membership's environmental interests are directly and adversely
19 affected by Temecula's failure to conduct necessary environmental review under CEQA relative to its
20 decision approving the Project. Additionally, SCALE members reside in geographical nexus to the
21 Project site and will be subjected to environmental harm as a result of Project approval a by Temecula.
22 33. SCALE has standing to sue under the public interest exception to the beneficial interest
23 requirement to standing, as its membership is composed of citizens interested in having the law
24 followed by seeing that there is no breach to CEQA.

25 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

26 34. SCALE has exhausted any and all available and necessary administrative remedies
27 through submission of timely written comments involving the subject matter of this litigation to
28 Temecula prior to close of the public hearing on the Project held December 12, 2017. To the extent
6

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate (SCAT P v Citv of Temarula lAmbiant Cammunitias TT M

1 this action raises issues not discussed in written comments submitted by SCALE, such issues were

2 raised by timely written comments of other commenters to the Draft and/or Final EIR, and have thus

3 been adequately exhausted in the CEQA administrative review process.

4 NO OTHER REMEDY AT LAW

5 35. SCALE has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law other
6 than the relief sought in this petition. SCALE is therefore entitled to the issuance of this Court's

7 peremptory writ of mandate.

8 ENTITLEMENT TO ATTORNEY'S FEES

9 36. SCALE is entitled to attorney's fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 1021.5 in
10 that the successful disposition of this lawsuit will result in the enforcement of important rights
11 affecting the public interest and will confer significant benefits upon the public or a large class of
12 persons. SCALE seeks to enforce important provisions of state and local environmental laws for the
13 benefit of the public, and to rectify certain procedural improprieties which will benefit all future

14 participants in the decision making process employed by Temecula. The necessity and financial
15 burden of private enforcement are such as to make the award appropriate, and such fees will not be

16 paid out of any recovery.

17 EIR POLICIES

18 37. An EIR is an informational document intended to inform agency decision-makers and
19 the public of the significant environmental effects of a project and minimize those significant effects

20 through the implementation of mitigation measures or project alternatives. (Pub. Res. Code § 21061;
21 CEQA Guidelines § 15121.)

22 38. CEQA requires that an EIR be adequate, complete, and evidence a good faith effort at
23 full disclosure. (CEQA Guidelines § 15003(i).) An adequate EIR must include enough relevant
24 information to permit full assessment of significant environmental impacts by the public and

25 reviewing agencies. (CEQA Guidelines § 15147.)

26 39. An EIR must identify and focus on the possible significant environmental effects of a
27 proposed project. Only effects which are clearly insignificant or unlikely to occur need not be

28 discussed in the EIR. (Pub. Res. Code § 21100; CEQA Guidelines § § 15126, 15126.2, and 15143.)
7

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate (SCAT.R v Citv of Temecuia [Amhiant Communitiec ITON

40. An adequate EIR must evaluate all potentially significant environmental impacts of a

2 proposed project, including both direct and indirect impacts, short-term and long-term impacts, local

3 and regional impacts, and cumulative impacts. (CEQA Guidelines § § 15126, 15126.2, and 15130.)

4 41. CEQA provides that the failure to comply with CEQA's information disclosure
5 provisions can result in a prejudicial abuse of discretion regardless of whether a different outcome

6 would have been reached if the agency had complied. (Pub. Res. Code § 21005(a).)

7 42. In order to assure that the mitigation measures and project revisions identified in the

8 EIR are implemented, the public agency must adopt a program for monitoring or reporting on the

9 revisions which it has required in the project and the measures it has imposed to mitigate or avoid
10 significant environmental effects. (CEQA Guidelines §§ 15091(d) and 15097(a).)
11 43. A lead agency is required to recirculate an EIR when significant new information is

12 added to the EIR after public notice is given of the availability of the draft EIR for public review but
13 before certification. (CEQA Guidelines 15088.5; Pub. Res. Code § 21092.1)

14 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

15 Violation of CEOA

16 A. Failure of EIR to Adequately Disclose, Analyze and Mitigate Fire Hazard Impacts
17 44. SCALE hereby restates and incorporates by reference each allegation set forth in
18 Paragraphs 1 through 43, inclusive, as though fully set forth verbatim herein.
19 45. The Draft EIR. fails to adequately disclose, analyze or mitigate the significant impacts
20 of the Project's fuel modification plans. The Center for Biological Diversity, the Sierra Club, and the
21 Cougar Connection submitted a joint letter commenting that the Draft EIR states the Project is "near"
22 a "High Fire Hazard Area," but never discloses where this area is in relation to the Project. Such
23 omission fails to inform the public as to the fire dangers associated with the Project. The EIR
24 accordingly fails as an informational document.

25 46. The Center for Biological Diversity, the Sierra Club, and the Cougar Connection
26 jointly commented that MM-HAZ-1 states that the applicant will prepare a "fuel modification plan"
27 prior to issuance of building permits in order to mitigate Project location "near" a "High Fire Hazard
28 Area." According to the County's Fire Department, fuel modification plans involve replacing native
8

Verified Petition for Wrif of Mandate (SCAT .F v Citv of Tempcula lAmhient Communitias ITCN

plants with drought resistant alternatives. As such, it is reasonable to assume that these fuel

2 modification plans would result in significant impacts on plants, wildlife, and other biological
resources. Nonetheless, the DEIR does not provide any information regarding the specifics of these

4 fuel modification plans; nor does the DEIR analyze the environmental impacts on biological resources

5 of implementing these plans. The DEIR should include areas impacted by fuel modification plans as

6 part of the development "footprint" of the Project, and be analyzed as such. Moreover, no fire

7 clearance/thinning activities should occur within the boundaries of any federally designated critical
8 habitat, open-space, natural area or wildlife movement corridor. Finally, fuel modification plans must

9 ensure that no invasive species are planted as part of the plans. Failure of the Project to properly
10 analyze and mitigate impacts related to Project location "near" a "High Fire Hazard Area" constitutes
11 a violation of CEQA.

12 47. SCALE notes in comments submitted December 12, 2017 that despite the Draft EIR's
13 discussion of fire hazard mitigation through MM-HAZ-1, the Mitigation Monitoring & Reporting
14 Program for the Project nonetheless omits any mitigation measures for fire hazards, even though
15 mitigation through a "fuel modification plan" is conceded as necessary based on Project location
16 "near" a "High Fire Hazard Area." The Project accordingly violates the CEQA requirement that
17 every necessary mitigation measure be monitored and enforced through a mitigation monitoring &
18 reporting program.

19 48. SCALE commented in a letter dated December 12, 2017 that, although conceding the
20 Project location is "near" a "High Fire Hazard Area," the Draft EIR paints an incomplete picture of
21 the actual fire hazards posed by the Project, and accordingly fails to properly analyze and mitigate all
22 associated fire hazards. This is so because the Project is in fact located entirely within a Very High
23 Fire Hazard Severity Zone in a Local Responsibility Area, as identified by the California Department
24 of Forestry and Fire Protection.

25 49. Government Code §§ 51175-51189 directs the California Department of Forestry and
26 Fire Protection ("Cal Fire") to identify areas of Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones (*VHFHSZs")
27 within Local Responsibility Areas ("LRA"). Cal Fire has published maps of VHFHSZs within an
28 LRA, and the most current map for the City of Temecula is map entitled "Very High Fire Hazard
9

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate (SCALE v. City of Temecula [Ambient Communities, LLCI)

Severity Zones in LRA" for the City of Temecula. Temecula adopted this map through Ordinance

2 No. 16-14 § 1, and codified it con at § 4904.3 of the Temecula Municipal Code.

3 50. Effective in 2008, the California Building Commission adopted California Building
4 Code Chapter 7A requiring new buildings in VHFHSZs to use ignition resistant construction methods

5 and materials. These new codes include provisions to improve the ignition resistance of buildings,

6 especially from firebrands. The code provisions applicable for buildings within VHFHSZs include the
7 California Building Code Chapter 7A, California Residential Code Section R337, California

8 Referenced Standards Code Chapter 12- 7A, and California Fire Code Chapter 49. (Cal. Fire Code §
9 4905.2) To comply with CEQA, all of these foregoing code sections must be imposed as enforceable
10 mitigation measures for the Project.

11 51. Despite the fact that all 16 parcels composing the Project site lie squarely within the
12 VHFHSZ for the LRA in Temecula, the EIR fails to disclose, analyze or mitigate any of the
13 associated Fire Hazard impacts. Temecula's errant refusal to do so is a violation of CEQA.
14 B. Failure of EIR to Adequately Disclose, Analyze and Mitigate Impacts to
15 Biological Communities, Water Supply and Traffic Circulation Either Adjacent to or
16 Coterminous with the Project.

17 52. SCALE hereby restates and incorporates by reference each allegation set forth in
18 Paragraphs through 51, inclusive, as though fully set forth verbatim herein.
19 53. On February 14, 2017, the Temecula City Council conducted a public hearing arising
20 from a request from City staff for direction from the City Council on future uses and/or activities on
21 the 55-acre South Parcel of the Project. During the hearing, representatives from several
22 organizations devoted to environmental conservation presented oral comments requesting that
23 Temecula require the Project to include the South Parcel as undeveloped open space to reduce
24 scientifically predicted impacts of the Project on the Santa Ana mountain lions and other wildlife.
25 54. Prior to the hearing on February 14, 2017, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
26 ("USFWS"), the California Department of Fish and 17 Wildlife ("CDFW") (collectively, the "Wildlife
27 Agencies") submitted a letter explaining that the South Parcel, located at the confluence of two
28 wildlife linkages, would not be an environmentally suitable site for the Project's proposed interpretive
10

v. Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate (SCALE v. City of Temecula [Ambient Communities, LLCJ)

center. The Wildlife Agencies opined that wildlife corridors are not appropriate locations for the

2 proposed trail system and resulting human occupancy. The Wildlife Agencies letter further stated that

3 development of the South Parcel would interfere with the functionality of two MSHCP wildlife

4 corridors, whose width and distance from human activity are critical for the mountain lion population

5 in the Santa Ana Mountains.

6 55. In spite of the overwhelming opposition to the Project's proposed uses of the South
7 Parcel, the City Council announced during its February 14, 2017 public hearing that it intended to

8 designate the South Parcel for development as part of the Project as an "interpretive center" with an
9 optional more intensively developed usage of the South Parcel (e.g. as a hospital, college, or other
10 civic building) in the event a future lawsuit would be filed against the Project.
11 56. In a December 2, 2017 letter, multiple conservation/environmental organizations (e.g. Center
12 for Biological Diversity, Sierra Club, etc.) (collectively "NGOs") detailed the many deficiencies of
13 the draft EIR which continued unresolved in the Final EIR. The letter also pointed out that the Final
14 EIR and associated project approval documents did not comply with CEQA and suffered from
15 numerous other inconsistencies with applicable laws and policies.
16 57. On the evening of Friday, December 8, 2017, the City posted the staff agenda materials
17 for the December 12, 2017 meeting of the City Council. The staff agenda materials included a letter
18 from the RCA dated December 7, 2017, which stated that while RCA had previously found that the
19 Project was inconsistent with the MSHCP, if 12 listed measures were incorporated as conditions of
20 approval for the Project, then the RCA would find the Project consistent with the MSHCP. Measure
21 No. 1 in the December 7, 2017 RCA Letter stated: "Final EIR, Chapter 2 will acknowledge the RCA
22 and Wildlife Agencies' require that the method for determining MSHCP consistency is at the
23 individual Criteria Cell level pursuant to the MSHCP." Although the 12 listed measures in the
24 December 7, 2017 RCA Letter included additional measures not contained in the Final EIR, the
25 December 7, 2017 RA Letter did not require the City or Ambient to fully comply with the Criteria
26 Refinement process.

27 58. In further violation of CEQA, none of the 12 listed measures contained in the
28 December 7, 2017 RCA Letter were made part of, or even mentioned in the Mitigation Monitoring &
1I

Reporting Program for the Project.

2 59. On December 12, 2017, Temecula conducted its last public hearing on the proposed
3 Project and Final EIR, specifically to determine whether to certify the Final EIR. Members of the
4 public, including Petitioner, the Wildlife Agencies, the NGOs and other experts in various aspects of
5 environmental science (e.g. mountain lion expert Dr. Winston Vickers) attended the public hearing
6 and opposed the certification of the Final EIR and approval of the Project as then-currently proposed.
7 The overwhelming majority of the public commenters again requested that Temecula designate the

8 South Parcel as open space so that it could continue to function as a viable wildlife corridor.

60. At the December 12, 2017 EIR certification public hearing, the Wildlife Agencies and
10 Environmental NGOs requested that the City delay approval of the Final EIR until the project
11 approval documents were revised to show consistency with the MSHCP and address other
12 inadequacies with the Project. Despite the request, Temecula's city council approved the Project and
13 certified the Final EIR at the conclusion of the December 12, 2017 public hearing.
14 61. The Project location is a biologically sensitive area and is home to many special status
15 species, including but not limited to: the western pond turtle, San Diego ambrosia, paniculate tarplant,
16 burrowing owl, California gnatcatcher, yellow warbler, Cooper's hawk, northern harrier, white-tailed
17 kite, and California horned lark, California red-legged frog, mountain yellow-legged frog, and arroyo
18 toad, among other species. The Project area also contains wildlife corridors of regional significance
19 for mountain lions and other wildlife.

20 62. The Project footprint is within Criteria Cells of the MSHCP. Criteria Cells describe

21 areas where MSHCP conservation will be focused. Compliance with the MSHCP reserve assembly is
22 required if any project is located within Criteria Cells. The Project is also located at the confluence
23 of the MSHCP's Proposed Constrained Linkage 13 along the Murrieta Creek, Proposed Linkage 10
24 between the foothills of the Santa Ana Mountains, and Proposed Constrained Linkage 14 along the
25 Temecula Creek and the Santa Margarita River. A "Constrained Linkage" is defined in the MSHCP
26 as a "constricted connection expected to provide for movement of identified Planning Species
27 between Core Areas, where options for assembly of the connection are limited due to existing patterns
28 of use."

12

Verified Detition for Wrif of Mandata (CCAT E u Citu of Tamanila lAmbiant Camminitiaa:

63. The EIR did not adequately disclose, analyze and/or mitigate the Project's significant

2 and cumulative impacts to biological resources, including numerous animal and plant species affected

3 by the Project. Those species include, but are not limited to, the western pond turtle, San Diego

4 ambrosia, paniculate tarplant, burrowing owl, California gnatcatcher, yellow warbler, Cooper's hawk,

5 northern harrier, white-tailed kite, and California horned lark, California red-legged frog, mountain

6 yellow-legged frog, and arroyo toad. The EIR's biological resources analysis is inadequate because,
7 among other things, the EIR's mitigation measures related to such matters are vague, deferred, and/or

8 unenforceable.

9 64. Of particular importance, the EIR fails to analyze, disclose, and/or mitigate the direct,
10 indirect, and cumulative impacts of the Project on mountain lions, including the Santa Ana mountain
11 lion population. CEQA defines an impact as significant if the Project may substantially reduce the
12 habitat of a wildlife species a or threaten to eliminate a plant or animal community. The Project would
13 threaten to eliminate the Santa Ana population of mountain lions by substantially degrading the
14 wildlife corridors that are critical for the continued survival of the population.

15 65. An additional biological concern was voiced by a public educational institution, San
16 Diego State University ("SDSU") in a letter dated June 27, 2016 submitted to Temecula in response
17 to the Draft EIR. The core message of the comment letter was that any usage of the proposed civic of

18 the Project's South Parcel could produce significant impacts to the nearby Santa Margarita Ecological
19 Reserve ("SMER"), an access-limited area managed by SDSU. In addition to its importance as a

20 biological and botanical habitat resource conservation site, SMER is utilized for scientific and

21 educational purposes by SDSU.

22 66. As stated above, the EIR also does not adequately disclose, analyze and/or mitigate the
23 Project's significant local water supplies impacts and cumulative traffic circulation impacts. Both
24 issues were raised in numerous comment letters and oral testimony at the public hearings on the
25 project.

26 67. Temecula committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in a
27 manner required by law by relying on an EIR that fails to meet the requirements of CEQA for
28 disclosure, analysis, and mitigation of significant project impacts on biological resources, water
13

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate (SCAT P v Citu of Temerula lAmbient Cammunitias IT0N

1 supplies and traffic circulation.

2 C. The EIR Fails to Adequately Address Project Alternatives.

3 68. SCALE hereby restates and incorporates by reference each allegation set forth in

4 Paragraphs 1 through 67, inclusive, as though fully set forth verbatim herein.

5 69. The EIR fails to provide a selection and discussion of alternatives that foster informed

6 decision-making and informed public participation under the auspices of CEQA. Specifically, the

7 EIR's analysis of Project alternatives does not meet the statutory and regulatory requirement of a

8 reasonable range of alternatives which could eliminate or reduce to insignificance the Project's
9 significant environmental impacts. Nor does the EIR focus on the alternatives that could either
10 eliminate the Project's adverse environmental impacts without unreasonably impeding the Project's
11 stated objectives, as required by CEQA.

12 70. Temecula's responses to comments in the Final EIR fail generally for two principle
13 reasons. First, the responses fail to adequately dispose of all the issues raised in public comments.
14 Second, Temecula does not provide its specific rationale for rejecting the public's suggested Project
15 changes, mitigation measures, or alternatives.

16 71. CEQA requires that the lead agency evaluate and respond to all environmental
17 comments on the Draft EIR that it receives during the public review period. The responses must
18 describe the disposition of the issues raised and must specifically explain the agency's reasons for
19 rejecting public suggestions and for proceeding without incorporating the suggestions. As such,

20 Temecula's responses to comments in its Final EIR fail to satisfy the requirements of CEQA.
21 D. Temecula's Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations Are
22 Fatally Deficient as a Matter of Law.

23 72. SCALE hereby restates and incorporates by reference each allegation set forth in
24 Paragraphs 1 through 71, inclusive, as though fully set forth verbatim herein.
25 73. CEQA requires that substantial evidence in the administrative record support all of an
26 agency's findings and conclusions contained in an EIR. The agency must also explain how the
27 evidence in the administrative record supports the conclusions the agency has reached in the EIR.
28 74. Respondent's Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations violate the
14

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate (SCAL.R v Citv of Temecula lAmhient Commnnitiac IICN

requirements of the CEQA Guidelines. Among other things, the Findings of Fact fail to identify the

2 changes or alterations that are required to avoid or substantially lessen the Project's significant

3 environmental effects. (CEQA Guidelines § 15091(a)(1).)

4 75. Additionally, the purported benefits of the Project cited in the Statement of Overriding

5 Considerations do not outweigh the substantial costs of the Project on the environment and public

6 health. The Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations are not supported by substantial

7 evidence. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15091(b).)

8 76. Where mitigation measures and alternatives to a project are not adopted, the CEQA

9 findings must identify specific economic, legal, social and technological and other important

10 considerations which make infeasible the adoption of mitigation measures or alternatives for a project.

11 Under CEQA, all factual findings must be supported by substantial evidence in the record and

12 disclose the analytical process by which approval of the Project is justified.

13 78. The findings regarding the impacts, mitigation measures, and alternatives relied upon

14 by Temecula's approval of the Project are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, and its

15 analytical connections between evidence and conclusions are insufficiently explained to be of benefit
16 to the members of the general public and other stakeholders.

17 79. The EIR's extensive nonconformity to the substantive and procedural requirements of
18 CEQA renders it a legally insufficient document which does not, per se, serve its fundamental

19 purpose of informing the public and other stakeholders of the true extent of the biological and other

20 impacts of Ambient's Project.

21 E. Temecula's Failure to Recirculate the EIR Violates CEQA.

22 80. SCALE hereby restates and incorporates by reference each allegation set forth in

23 Paragraphs 1 through 79, inclusive, as though fully set forth verbatim herein.

24 81. CEQA requires that if significant new information is added to an EIR after a draft EIR

25 is prepared before certification of the final EIR, an amended EIR must be recirculated for public
26 review and comment by the lead agency.

27 82. The December 7, 2017 RCA Letter, the December 8, 2017 "Addition to Final EIR"
28 (posted for the first time in the Agenda for the public hearing), and the December 12, 2017 FEA by

10

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate (SCAT.R v Citv of Temecala [Ambient Communities TICN

1 Helix Environmental Planning (not released to the public for the first time until after Project

2 approval), among other items, together constitute significant new information necessitating

3 recirculation of the EIR.

4 83. Despite these changes, Temecula did not recirculate the EIR or any portion of the EIR

5 as required CEQA. Nor did Respondents update the text of the Final EIR to reflect the proposed

6 changes in the December 7, 2017 RCA Letter, the "Addition to Final EIR" or the FEA by Helix

7 Environmental Planning. As a result of Temecula's failure to recirculate the EIR, the public and other

8 public agencies were deprived of any meaningful opportunity to review and comment on the approved

9 Project, its substantial adverse environmental consequences, and the new information regarding other

10 unanalyzed environmental effects of the Project.

11 84. By failing to amend and recirculate the EIR, Temecula committed a prejudicial abuse

12 of discretion when it failed to proceed in the manner required by law.
13 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

14 WHEREFORE, based upon the foregoing allegations, SCALE prays for relief as follows:

15 1. For this Court's peremptory writ of mandate directing Temecula to vacate and set aside

16 the Altair Specific Plan Project approved on December 12, 2017 for violation of CEQA;
17 2. For this Court's peremptory writ of mandate remanding the Altair Specific Plan Project

18 approved on December 12, 2017 to Temecula for reconsideration after proper environmental review is

19 conducted through preparation and certification of a legally sufficient EIR in compliance with CEQA;
20 3. For all costs associated with the prosecution of this action;

21 4. For attorney's fees incurred in the prosecution of this action under the private attorney
22 general doctrine pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, section 1021.5;

23 5. For such other and further equitable or legal relief as this Court deems just and fit.
