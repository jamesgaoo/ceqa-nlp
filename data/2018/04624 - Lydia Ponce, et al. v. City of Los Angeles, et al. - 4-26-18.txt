JURISDICTION AND VENUE

11 17. Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and section 1085 and

12 Public Resources Code sections 21168, 21168.5 and 21168.9, this Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ

13 of mandate to set aside Respondents' decision to certify the Project's environmental impact report and
purported approval of the Project.
14 18.

15 Venue is proper in this Court because the Project lies entirely within the County of Los

16 Angeles and the environmental impacts of the Project will be acutely felt in this County. The cause

17 alleged in this Petition, or some part of that cause, arise in this county. (Code Civ. Proc. ("CCP") § 393;

18 Cal. State Parks Foundation V. Super. Ct. (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 826.) Venue is also proper in this
Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 394 (actions against city, county or local agency)

19 and 395 (actions generally), since the City of Los Angeles is in the County of Los Angeles.
19.
20 The petition initiating this action was timely filed within 30 days after Respondent's

21 decision to issue a Notice of Determination in accordance with Public Resources Code sections
21167(a).
22 20.

23 Petitioners provided written notice to Respondents of their intention to file the petition in

24 compliance with Public Resources Code section 21167.5. The notice and proof of service are attached
hereto as Exhibit A.

25 21.

26 Petitioners have caused a copy of this pleading to be served on the Attorney General not

27 more than ten days after the commencement of this proceeding, as required by Public Resources Code
Section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure Section 388. A true and correct copy of the notice is

28 attached to this pleading as Exhibit "B."

-4-
[PROPOSED] THIRD AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

22. Petitioner has filed request for hearing in compliance with PRC section 21167.4,

2 a true and correct copy of which request is attached hereto as Exhibit C.

3 23. Petitioners performed all conditions precedent to filing this instant action and exhausted

4 Iadministrative remedies to the extent required by law under Public Resources Code section 21177.

5 Petitioners and/or other agencies and individuals raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in the
petition orally or in writing during the Respondents' decision-making process.
6 24. The violations by Respondents alleged herein have affected the beneficial interests of
7 Petitioners and/or their supporting members. The relief sought by way of this Petition will redress these

8 beneficial interests and the likelihood of future injury and interference with Petitioners' interests, and

9 those of their supporting members.

10 25. Petitioners have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy under ordinary law unless this

11 Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside the certification of the

12 Project and supporting environmental documents. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents'

13 decisions will remain in effect in violation of state law and injurious to Petitioners.
STATUTORY FRAMEWORK
14 California Environmental Quality Act
15 26. CEQA requires state and local agencies to identify the potentially significant
16 environmental impacts of their actions, and then to avoid or mitigate those impacts if feasible.

17 27. CEQA requires that an agency analyze the potential environmental impacts of its

18 proposed actions in an environmental impact report (except in certain limited circumstances). (See, e.g.,

19 PRC § 21100, et seq. The EIR is the very heart of CEQA. Dunn-Edwards v. BAAQMD (1992) 9

20 Cal.App.4th 644, 652.) "The 'foremost principle' in interpreting CEQA is that the Legislature intended

21 the act to be read so as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable

22 scope of the statutory language." (Cmtys. for a Better Env't v. Cal. Resources Agency (2002) 103
Cal.App.4th 98, 109.)
23 28. CEQA has two primary purposes. First, CEQA is designed to inform decision makers
24 and the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of a project. (14 Cal. Code Reg.
25 ("CEQA Guidelines") § 15002(a)(1).) "Its purpose is to inform the public and its responsible officials

26 of the environmental consequences of their decisions before they are made. Thus, the EIR protects not

27 only the environment but also informed self-government.'" (Citizens of Goleta Valley V. Bd. of

28 Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564). The EIR has been described as "an environmental 'alarm bell'

-5-
[PROPOSED] THIRD AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- whose purpose it is to alert the public and its responsible officials to environmental changes before they

2 have reached ecological points of no return."(Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay v. Bd. of Port Comrs.

3 (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1354 ("Berkeley Jets").)
29.
4 Second, CEQA requires public agencies to avoid or reduce environmental damage when

5 "feasible" by requiring "environmentally superior" alternatives and all feasible mitigation measures. (14

6 CCR 15002(a)(2) and (3); Citizens of Goleta Valley, supra, 52 Cal.3d at 564.) The EIR serves to

7 provide agencies and the public with information about the environmental impacts of a proposed project

8 and to "identify ways that environmental damage can be avoided or significantly reduced." (CEQA
Guidelines 15002(a)(2).).

9 30. Finally, CEQA requires public agencies to consider the environmental effects of a Project

10 prior to approving a Project as part of a public agency's decision-making process. Section 21002.1(d) of

11 the Cal. Public Resources Code requires a public agency to "consider[] the effects, both individual and

12 collective, of all activities involved in a project." a
31.
13 a CEQA requires that a public agency considers approval of a Project is required

14 concurrently with the public agency's decision as to whether to approve or disapprove a specific project.

15 Section 21003(a) of the Cal. Public Resources Code specifically requires that [l]ocal agencies integrate

16 the requirements of this division with planning and environmental review procedures otherwise required

17 by law or by local practice so that all those procedures, to the maximum feasible extent, run
concurrently, rather than consecutively.

18 32. Consistent with the mandate that the CEQA process runs concurrently with a public

19 agency's decision as to whether to approve or disapprove a specific project, CEQA requires that a public

20 agency considers a project's environmental impacts when "determining whether to approve the project"

21 CEQA Guidelines § 15093(a).
33.
22 A project is approved for the purposes of CEQA when public agency commits "to a

23 definite course of action . . . [including an] entitlement for use of the project." (CEQA Guidelines
15352).

24 34.

25 A CEQA determination cannot be finalized prior to approval of 1 project. (Cty. of Amador)

26 V. El Dorado Cty. Water Agency, 76 Cal. App. 4th 931, 965 (1999) (citing CEQA Guidelines § 15352(a);
Coalition for Clean Air v. City of Visalia (2012) 209 Cal. App. 4th 408, 423.)

27 35. Similarly, a CEQA determination cannot be adopted after a project has been approved.

28 Save Tara v. City of West Hollywood (2008) 45 Cal. 4th 116, 127, 132 (finding that subsequent
"preparation and certification of an EIR" does not render a lawsuit moot and that "an agency has no
-6-
[PROPOSED] THIRD AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- discretion to define approval so as to make its commitment to a project precede the required preparation
of an EIR."). 2
36. CEQA requires that public agency allow the public to appeal a CEQA determination to a
3 public "agency's elected decision making body." (PRC § 21151(c)). A CEQA determination and project
4 approval is not "final" until "the final adjudicatory administrative decision." (Hensler v. City of
5 Glendale (1994) 8 Cal. 4th 1, 22).

6 37. The required CEQA environmental review involves both substantive and procedural

7 steps. Public participation plays an important and protected role in the CEQA process. (Laurel Heights

8 Improvement Association v. Regents of the University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392 ("The

9 EIR process protects not only the environment but also informed self government."); Concerned

10 Citizens of Costa Mesa, Inc. V. 32nd District Agricultural Association (1986) 42 Cal.3d 929, 936

11 (members of the public have a "privileged position" in the CEQA process)), "Each public agency should
include provisions in its CEQA procedures for wide public involvement, formal and informal, consistent
12 with its existing activities and procedures, in order to receive and evaluate public reactions to
13 environmental issues related to the agency's activities." (CEQA Guidelines§ 15201). The lead agency
14 must consider all "comments a it receives on a draft environmental impact report, proposed negative

15 declaration, or proposed mitigated declaration." (PRC § 21091(d)(1); CEQA Guidelines § 15074(b)).

16 38. Procedurally, a lead agency may not approve a project until the public has been given a

17 full and adequate opportunity to participate and comment on the project.

18 39. CEQA also disallows approval of a project that fails to comply with other laws. A lead

19 agency may not approve a project with significant unavoidable impacts unless it is "otherwise
permissible under applicable laws and regulations." (PRC § 21002.1(c).) 20 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL
21 40. This proceeding involves enforcement of important rights affecting the public interest.
22 Issuance of the relief requested in this First Amended Petition will confer a substantial benefit on the
23 public, including citizens, residents, businesses and taxpayers of the City, and will result in the

24 enforcement of important public rights by requiring Respondents to comply with CEQA and other legal
25 requirements applicable to the proposed Project; by voiding the Project approvals and prohibiting

26 Respondents and Real Parties in Interest from taking further actions with respect to the Project until it

27 has complied with those legal requirements; and by prohibiting the Respondents from undertaking any

28 portion of the Project until they have fully complied with these legal requirements
41. Petitioners are entitled to recover attorneys' fees as provided in Code of Civil Procedure
-7-
[PROPOSED] THIRD AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

P section 1021.5 if they prevail in this action. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement of these

2 public rights entitle Petitioners to an awarc of reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to that section.

3 STATEMENT OF FACTS
42.
4 In February of 2013, Real Party submitted applications to the City to redevelop the

5 Project Site ("Project Applications"). The Real Party applied for a subdivision of the Project Site from

6 one 562,314 net square-foot parcel into four lots, Case No. AA-2012-919-PMLA, as well as for a Site

7 Plan Review for the construction, use, and maintenance of four new industrial buildings, Case No. DIR-
2013-887-SPR.

8 43. The Project Site is located at 4051 South Alameda Street, 1700-1838 East Martin Luther

9 King Jr. Boulevard, 1708-1835 East 40th Place, 1707-1843 East 41st Street, and 4014 and 4066 South

10 Long Beach in the City of Los Angeles. The Project Site is legally described as EAST JEFFERSON

11 STREET TRACT NO 1 EX OF ST LOT 106 AND ALL OF LOTS 107 THRU 115, also known as APN
No. 5117021020.
12 44.
13 In May of 2013, the City circulated an Initial Study Mitigated Negative Declaration

14 environmental document on the Project. The environmental documentation for the Project were assigned

15 Case Nos. ENV-2012-920-EIR by the City and SCH No.2014061030 by the State Clearinghouse.
45.

16 After receiving numerous comments on the Initial Study Mitigated Negative

17 Declaration for the Project, the City opted to prepare a full environmental impact report.
46.

18 The Draft Environmental Impact Report for the Project was circulated to the public for
public comment between January 22, 2015, and March 9, 2015.

19 47.

48. The Final Environmental Impact Report for the Project was released on June 16, 2016.

20 On July 6, 2016, the City's Deputy Advisory Agency and Planning Department

21 conducted a public hearing on the Project.
49.
22 On September 23, 2016, the City's Deputy Advisory Agency and Planning Department

23 approved the Project and findings related to the Project, including approval of the subdivision for the

24 Project (AA-2012-919-PMLA) and the Site Plan Review (DIR-2013-887-SPR) for the Project, as well

25 as certifying the Project's environmental impact report and adopting a statement of overriding

26 considerations (ENV-2012-920-EIR, SCH No. 2014061030). (*Deputy Advisory Agency's September
23, 2016 decision").

27 50. On October 11, 2016, Mr. Tezozomoc of South Central Farmers appealed the September

28 23, 2016, decision to the City's Planning Commission in its entirety including the subdivision for the
Project (AA-2012-919-PMLA), the Site Plan Review (DIR-2013-887-SPR), as well as the Project's
-8-
[PROPOSED] THIRD AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- environmental impact report and statement of overriding considerations (ENV-2012-920-EIR, SCH No.

2 2014061030) (*October 11, 2016 appeal").
51.
3 On November 10, 2016, the City Planning Commission conducted a public hearing on

4 the Project, approved the Project, and denied Mr. Tezozomoc's October 11, 2016, appeal, sustaining and

5 adopting the findings of the Deputy Advisory Agency's September 23, 2016, decision which included

6 the subdivision for the Project (AA-2012-919-PMLA), the Site Plan Review (DIR-2013-887-SPR), and

7 the Project's environmental impact report and statement of overriding considerations (ENV-2012-920-

8 EIR, SCH No. 2014061030 ("Planning Commission's November 10, 2016 decision").

52.

0 On December 15, 2016, Mr. Tezozomoc of South Central Farmers appealed the Planning

10 Commission's November 10, 2016, decision to the City Council in its entirety, including the subdivision
for the Project (AA-2012-919-PMLA) ("Subdivision"), the Site Plan Review (DIR-2013-887-SPR)

11 ("Site Plan Review"), and the Project's environmental impact report and statement of overriding

12 considerations (ENV-2012-920-EIR, SCH No. 2014061030) ("CEQA Determination" or collectively

13 with the Subdivision and Site Plan Review as "December 15, 2016 appeal"). However, the City only

14 accepted the appeal of the Project's CEQA Determination, taking the position that the Subdivision and

15 Site Plan Review were final as of the Planning Commission's November 10, 2016 decision to approve
the Project and certify the EIR.

16 53.

17 On March 7, 2017, the City Planning and Land Use Management Committee, a

18 subcommittee of the City Council ("PLUM"'), conducted a public hearing on the Project, recommending
that the City Council deny Mr. Tezozomoc's December 15, 2016, appeal, and upheld the Planning

19 Commission's November 10, 2016, decision. ("PLUM's March 7, 2017 decision").
54.
20 On March 21, 2017, the City Council conducted a hearing on the Project and denied the

21 Mr. Tezozomoc's December 15, 2016, appeal and upheld PLUM's March 7, 2017 decision.

22 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

23 55. (Violations of CEQA; EIR Does Not Comply With CEQA)

24 herein. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate all the above paragraphs as if fully set forth

25 56.

26 CEQA requires the lead agency for a project to prepare an EIR that complies with the

27 requirements of the statute. The lead agency also must provide for public review and comment on the
project and associated environmental documentation. An EIR must provide an adequate project

28 description and sufficient environmental analysis such that decision-makers can intelligently consider
environmental consequences when acting on the proposed project.
-9-
[PROPOSED] THIRD AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

57. Respondents violated CEQA by certifying a Final EIR that fails to adequately analyze

2 and mitigate for the Project's environmental impacts, including but not limited to:

a. Failure to consider a reasonable range of alternatives by rejecting reasonable
3 alternatives including a community garden alterative.
+n b. Failure to provide an adequate range of project objectives by limiting project
objective to objectives related to utilizing the Project Site as an industrial park,
6 prematurely foreclosing potential alternatives such as utilizing the Project Site as

7 a urban farm..

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Violations of CEQA; Failure to Substantially Support Factual Findings and Overriding
Considerations)
3 59. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate all the above paragraphs as if fully set forth
4 herein.

5 60. CEQA requires that a lead agency's findings for the approval of a project be supported by

6 substantial evidence in the administrative record. CEQA further requires that a lead agency provide an

7 explanation of how evidence in the record supports the conclusions it has reached.

8 61. Respondents violated CEQA by adopting findings and a Statement of Overriding

9 Considerations that are inadequate as a matter a of law as they are not supported by substantial evidence

10 in the record, including but not limited to the following:

a.
11 The determinations that certain environmental impacts would be less than
significant or that adopted mitigation measures would avoid or lessen the
12 Project's significant effects on the environment.
13 b. The determinations that alternatives to the Project and proposed mitigation
14 measures that would have avoided or lessened the significant impacts of the

15 Project were infeasible, including but not limited to the no-Project alternative and

16 the other alternatives examined in the EIR; and

17 C. The determinations that other environmental impact were significant and

18 unavoidable and had been mitigated to the extent feasible.
62.
19 a As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by

20 making determinations or adopting findings and a Statement of Overriding Considerations that do not
comply with the requirements of CEQA and approving the Project in reliance thereon. Accordingly,
21 Respondents' certification of the Final EIR and purported approval of the Project must be set aside.
22 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

23 (Violations of CEQA; Certifying An EIR After Project Approval)
24 63. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate all the above paragraphs as if fully set forth

25 herein.

26 64. CEQA requires that a lead agency prepare and certify an EIR for a Project concurrently

27 with approval of a project to allow the environmental effects of a project to be considered as part of a

28 public agency's decision-making process.

-12-
[PROPOSED] THIRD AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

P 65. CEQA requires that a full public process be conducted, including requiring local agencies

2 to allow an appeal of both the project approvals and EIR certification to an elected decision-making

3 body, as part of CEQA's mandate that the public be given a full and adequate opportunity to participate

4 and comment on a project and for a lead agency to fully consider the public reactions to a project's
environmental impacts.
5 66.

6 Respondents violated CEQA by declaring the Planning Commission's November 10,
2016 decision to approve

7 the Project as final and not allowing the project approvals and EIR

8 certification to be appealed to City Council, even though the Project's EIR was not certified until March
21, 2016 when the City Council denied Mr. Tezozomoc's appeal.

9 67.

10 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

11 WHEREFORE, Petitioner pray for judgment as set forth below:

A. For

12 writ of mandate commanding Respondent to vacate and withdraw the certification
of the EIR and any purported approvals of the Project, to require Respondents to complete the CEQA
