VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

INTRODUCTION

2 1. The Center for Biological Diversity ("Petitioner") hereby petitions this Court for a

3 Writ of Mandate pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and California

4 Public Resources Code section declaring that Respondents Monterey County Board of

5 Supervisors and Monterey County (collectively, the "County") violated the California

6 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), California Public Resources Code §§ 21000 et seq., in

7 approving a Conditional Use Permit (PLN160146) for four exploratory wells in Monterey County
8 (the "Project") on April 3, 2018.

9 2. The project applicant, Trio Petroleum, LLC (*Trio" or the "Applicant") proposed
10 to drill four new exploratory wells in the Hames Valley area of Monterey County with the
11 expectation that those wells would produce commercially profitable amounts of oil. Each new

12 well would be located on a separate worksite.

13 3. The aim of the Project is to turn Hames Valley into a new area for commercially
14 viable oil production by drilling dozens of new wells to pump petroleum from the subsurface and
15 transport the product to refineries. The Project will utilize numerous hazardous chemicals in
16 support of drilling, well completion and maintenance, and production. Initiating oil production
17 activities will also increase traffic, air and water pollution, and noise and light disturbance.
18 4. These activities jeopardize the area's groundwater, surface water, air quality,
19 climate, and habitat, which support dozens of special status species, including fully protected

20 species under state law.

21 5. Though Petitioner and the Monterey County Planning Commission raised such

22 concerns, these foreseeable impacts were omitted in the incomplete and inadequate Initial Study

23 of the environmental impacts associated with the Project and were ignored by the Board of
24 Supervisors when it approved the Project.

25 6. The County and the Initial Study improperly isolate the impact from the four

26 "exploratory" wells from the reasonably foresecable impacts from future wells drilled on those
27 sites. This sort of "piecemealing" artificially minimizes the environmental impacts of the Project
28

- 2 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 by willfully ignoring the harm that may result if and when Trio's exploratory wells confirm

2 commercially producible volumes of petroleum, prompting the addition of dozens more wells in

3 the area that has been heretofore undisturbed by oil and gas activity.

4 7. Given the infrastructure investment necessary for the Project and the explicit
5 "testing" purpose of the Project, the County's approval of the first phase Conditional Use Permit

6 will create irreversible momentum for expanded long-term production. Because future phases of

7 the project are probable and reasonably foreseeable, CEQA requires that the County analyze the

8 Project's potential cumulative environmental impacts from future development. In particular,
9 long-term production would likely involve the drilling of numerous additional wells, the repeated
10 use of acid washing, and the production of a significant amount of oil. The County's failures to
11 identify, disclose, and evaluate impacts from those reasonably foreseeable future activities is

12 contrary to CEQA.
13 8. In approving the Project under these circumstances, the County violated the

14 requirements of CEQA and California Code of Regulations, tit.14, sections 15000 et seq.
15 (hereinafter "CEQA Guidelines"), which provide that the County must prepare, consider, and

16 certify an environmental impact report ("EIR") prior to the approval of any project that may have
17 a significant impact on the environment. CEQA requires the preparation of an EIR whenever

18 there is a "fair argument" that the project may have significant direct, indirect, and cumulative
19 impacts on the environment. The County's failure to prepare an EIR prior to its approval of Trio's
20 Project, despite the existence of substantial evidence that the Project may have significant adverse
21 effects on the environment, including on air resources, water resources, human health and safety,

22 and wildlife, constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

23 9. Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law for the County's failure to discharge its
24 clear legal duties under CEQA. Accordingly, Petitioner seeks a peremptory writ of mandate

25 setting aside the County's certification of the Mitigated Negative Declaration and approval of the
26 Conditional Use Permit for the Project and enjoining any activity pursuant to the Project approval
27 until the County prepares, considers, and certifies a legally adequate EIR. Issuance of the
28

- 3 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

requested relief will confer a significant benefit on the public and will result in the enforcement of

2 important public rights, including the public's right to disclosure of the potentially significant

3 direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts from the Project and the public's right to ensure that the

4 County only approve projects that are consistent with the state's environmental laws.

5 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

6 10. This Court has jurisdiction under section 1094.5 of the California Code of Civil

7 Procedure and section 21168 of the California Public Resources Code.

8 11. Venue is proper under section 393 of the Civil Code of Procedure because the

9 cause of this action arose in Monterey County and direct effects of the County's action will occur
10 in Monterey County.
11 PARTIES

12 12. Petitioner CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY ("the Center") is a

13 nonprofit, public interest environmental organization dedicated to the protection of native species
14 and their habitats through science, policy, and environmental law. The Center's Climate Law
15 Institute works to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other air pollutants to protect biological

16 diversity, the environment, and public health. Specific objectives include ensuring that the
17 impacts of oil and gas operations - encompassing the climate, environmental, and public health
18 impacts of operations themselves, as well as the combustion of the produced oil and gas - are
19 accurately accounted for, considered, and mitigated if approved in accordance with science and
20 applicable law. The Center has more than 40,000 members, including members who reside in

21 Monterey County. Center members have recreational, scientific, and educational interests in the

22 region at issue, and are particularly interested in protecting the native, imperiled, and sensitive
23 species and their habitats that the Project may affect. The Center's members therefore will be

24 directly and adversely affected by the County's approval of the Project, issuance of a conditional
25 use permit, and adoption of the Initial Study and Mitigated Negative Declaration. Also, the Center

26 participated extensively in the administrative process resulting in the County's approval of the
27 Project, submitting multiple comment letters, appealing the Planning Commission's approval of

5 California and is responsible for the approval of the Conditional Use Permit and adoption of the
Mitigated Negative Declaration.

7 Respondent BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OF MONTEREY COUNTY is the

8 body that supervises the operation of the Monterey County government and is responsible for the

10 Real Party in Interest TRIO PETROLEUM LLC is an oil and gas company

11 headquartered in Bakersfield, California and is the Project applicant and proposed operator, as

12 well as the and designated permittee under the Conditional Use Permit.

BACKGROUND

13 16.

14 On July 1, 2016, Trio submitted an application for a conditional use permit to the

15 Monterey County Planning Commission seeking approval to drill four (4) new exploratory wells
in Hames Valley, each well requiring its own well site.
16 The Project Area

17 17.

18 The four prosed well sites are located on land zoned as Farmlands or Permanent
Grazing in southern Monterey County.
19 18.

20 The Project area contains non-native grasslands as well as oak woodland. An

21 ephemeral stream is present 50 feet from one of the proposed well sites. The San Antonio River is
located 0.3 miles south of the Project site.

22 19.

23 The area serves as habitat for a wide variety of plant and animal species. A total of

24 41 special status plant species and 18 special status wildlife species are known to or have the

25 potential to occur within the vicinity of the Project sites.

20.

26 One such species is the golden eagle, a fully protected species under state law. A

27 golden eagle was sighted at the project location, yet the biological opinion relied upon by the
County does not contain this information.

28

- 5 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 21. The Project is within the North Central Coast Air Basin (NCCAB). The NCCAB is

2 designated in nonattainment-transitional for the state ozone standard, and nonattainment for the

3 state coarse particulate matter (PM10) standard.

4 The Proposed Project

5 22. According to Trio's application, each exploratory well site would contain a drilling

6 rig over 100 feet tall, an open pit to collect drilling fluid and drill cuttings, and other apparatuses
7 necessary to drill the wells.

8 23. Each site would require over 450 hours of continuous drilling and involve the
9 transportation, storage, use, and disposal of hazardous chemicals, many of which are unknown.

10 24. Trio anticipates that the four exploratory wells will lead to more wells and
11 expanded oil and gas activity. At the December 13, 2017 Planning Commission hearing, the
12 representative for Trio stated, "these sites are probably going to be housing maybe 3 to 6 wells
13 each…and those wells will be going to different places in that anticline."l He added, "We are
14 going to locate multiple wells on those sites in the development situation.... That will be the end
15 result, hopefully.2

16 25. Trio has estimated that the area may contain "hundreds of millions of barrels of
17 recoverable oil and significant recoverable natural gas."

18 26. Trio plans to use hazardous materials to aid in the drilling process, and will store

19 these chemicals on site. Trio's Project will also utilize "acid wash" as part of the Project.
20 27. Wastewater from the Project, which contains harmful chemicals, would be

21 collected and trucked to a separate disposal site.

22 The Initial Study and Mitigated Negative Declaration

23 28. In response to the Trio's application for a conditional use permit, the Planning

24 Commission staff prepared an Initial Study of the environmental impacts and a Mitigated
25 Negative Declaration (IS-MND) that asserted that after certain mitigation measures were

1 implemented, there would be no significant impacts as a result of Trio's proposed project.

2 29. The IS-MND analyzed the environmental impact only from the 4 proposed wells.

3 It asserted that further production was too "speculative" to analyze. This critical omission renders

4 the IS-MND deeply flawed and fundamentally unreliable as an information document.

5 30. Expanded oil and gas production in Hames Valley will result in significant impacts

6 for water quality, air quality, biological resources, and greenhouse gas emissions. Such expansion
7 is not speculative, but instead, is highly probable and constitutes the stated intent and purpose of
8 the Project. Trio has made statements to the Planning Commission that it anticipates expanded oil

9 production in the area after the exploratory wells are completed. Thus, the approval of the
10 Conditional Use Permit at issue here is the key decision point, creating irreversible momentum

11 for long-term commercial oil production and necessitating consideration of the environmental

12 impacts that may accompany such probable future project activities.
13 31. The County also failed to consider the greenhouse gas emissions that will result
14 from the refining and combustion of the heavy oil that will likely be produced and sold by the
15 Project (in addition to oil produced as part of long-term commercial production).
16 32. The IS-MND also provides inadequate analysis of the foreseeable impacts that
17 would result from using harmful chemicals in the oil drilling and production products. While it

18 mentions that hazardous materials will be stored and used as part of the operations, there is
19 neither a comprehensive list of chemicals, nor disclosure of their adverse health impacts.

'20 33. The IS-MND also omits analysis of the cumulative impacts of the proposed wells
21 in Hames Valley when combined with the thousands of existing oil and gas wells in the county.
22 34. The IS-MND erroneously concluded that Trio's project would result in less than

23 significant impacts for, inter alia, aesthetics, agricultural and forest resources, geology/soils,
24 greenhouse gas emissions, hazardous materials, hydrology/water quality, land use/planning,
25 noise, and transportation/traffic. The IS-MND also stated incorrectly that impacts to air quality
26 and biological resources would be less than significant after mitigation measures.
27 35. For example, while disclosing that acid washing will occur, the IS-MND contains
28

- 7-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

no analysis of how these operations will impact air or water quality.

2 36. The Project is also likely impact water quality because the wastewater produced

3 with oil contains chemicals harmful to human health. The IS-MND does not analyze the impacts
4 of wastewater disposal. The application only mentions that wastewater will be trucked to a
separate facility. There is no acknowledgement of the risk of spills and accidents that come with

6 storing and transporting this toxic-laden waste fluid. There is also no assessment of the impacts
on water once this fluid is disposed of.

37. The IS-MND's conclusion that the impacts to biological resources will be less than
significant is not supported by the evidence. While the well pads may only constitute a

10 disturbance of 5.8 acres, noise, light, vibration, air, and water pollution do not stop at the
11 boundary of the worksite. There is also inadequate evidence to support the conclusion that the

12 golden eagle will not be harmed. While the Planning Commission staff noted the golden eagle
13 sighting, the IS-MND lacks an adequate analysis of the potential impacts of this Project on the
14 golden eagle population in the area.

15 The Planning Commission Denial

16 38. The Planning Commission held a hearing on the proposed Project on December
17 13, 2017. The Planning Commission found the Project to be not in the interests of Monterey

-18 County, and ordered the staff to prepare a resolution denying the application and prepare findings

19 that accurately reflect the threats to public health and safety and the environment posed by Trio's
20 proposed Project.

21 39. On January 30, 2018, Petitioner submitted comments urging the Planning

22 Commission to adopt the revised resolution denying the Application.
23 40. On January 31, 2018, after hearing comments from Trio and the public, the

24 Planning Commission found, inter alia, that oil and gas activities were injurious to the public
25 welfare, including groundwater quality and climate, and there were no counterbalancing benefits
26 of the Project that would offset the adverse impacts. The Planning Commission voted 6-3 to deny
27 the Application and adopt Resolution No. 18-008 and its findings to support its decision.

41. On February 13, Trio appealed the Planning Commission's denial.

2 The County's Approval

3 42. On April 3, 2018, the Board of Supervisors held a hearing on Trio's appeal of the
4 Planning Commission decision.

5 43. Petitioners again submitted comments opposing the Project highlighting the legal

6 deficiencies of approving the project without adequate environmental review. Petitioners also

7 spoke at the hearing, urging the Board not to overturn the Planning Commission's decision.

8 44. Ultimately, the Board voted to reverse the Planning Commission's decision,

9 approve the project, adopt the IS-MND, and issue a conditional use permit to Trio.
10 45. Following the County's issuance of a Notice of Determination for the Project,
11 Petitioners filed this timely petition.

12 Notices to the Attorney General and County
13 46. Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.7 by filing a
14 copy of this petitioner with the California Attorney General's Office. A copy of that notice is
15 attached as Exhibit A.

16 47. Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by
17 providing the County with notice of intention to commence the action. A copy of that notice is
18 attached as Exhibit B.

19 48. Petitioners elect to exercise their right to prepare the administrative record for this
20 action. A copy of that election is attached as Exhibit C.
21 CLAIM FOR RELIEF

22 49. Petitioners incorporate all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.
23 50. The Project is project within the meaning of CEQA.

24 51. The County's approval of the Conditional Use Permit for the Project was a
25 discretionary action subject to CEQA.
26 52. CEQA requires the County, in considering whether to prepare an EIR, to assess the
27 environmental effects of all reasonably foreseeable probable phases of a project and to include in
28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

its analysis, among other things, a description of the project and the environmental setting; an

2 evaluation and disclosure of the direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental effects of the

3 project; and reasonable mitigation measures to avoid or minimize the project's significant

4 environmental effects. Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15063.

5 53. The County must prepare an EIR if a fair argument can be made on the basis of

6 substantial evidence in the record that the Project may have a significant adverse environmental

7 impact. The County must prepare an EIR under such circumstances even if evidence also exists to

8 the contrary.

54. Furthermore, the existence of serious public controversy concerning the

10 environmental effect of a project in itself indicates that preparation of an EIR is needed.
11 Numerous members of the public voiced opposition to the Project and called for the need for
12 environmental review.

13 55. The adequacy of the County's review in preparing the Initial Study and Mitigated
14 Negative Declaration is reviewed for abuse of discretion. Abuse of discretion is established if the

15 agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law, the decision is not supported by the
16 findings, or the findings are not supported by substantial evidence in the record. Code Civ. Proc.
17 1094.5(b).

18 56. The County abused its discretion by segmenting the project and preparing an
19 Initial Study and Mitigated Negative Declaration, rather than an EIR, for approval of the
20 Conditional Use Permit that did not fulfill the requirements of CEQA. In particular, the Initial
21 Study and Mitigated Negative Declaration did not evaluate and disclose the reasonably
22 foreseeable direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental effects of the Project and of probable
23 future phases of the Project as required by CEQA, including as follows:
24 a. Failure to Consider All Phases of the Project: the record demonstrates that
25 the County abused its discretion by improperly piecemealing the stages of the
26 Project and failing to consider and evaluate the reasonably foreseeable
27 environmental impacts of expanded oil and gas development in and around

6 Failure to Disclose and Explain Environmental Effects. The County abused

7 its discretion by failing to adequately disclose and evaluate the Project's

9 ii. Biological resources;

10 iii. Greenhouse gas emissions;
11 iv. Water quality;

21 The County violated CEQA by not analyzing these impacts because a fair

22 argument can be made that the Project may result in significant impacts in each of these areas.

58.

23 Respondents' failure to comply with its legal obligations under CEQA constitutes

24 a prejudicial abuse of discretion actionable under California Public Resources Code section

21168 and California Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5.
