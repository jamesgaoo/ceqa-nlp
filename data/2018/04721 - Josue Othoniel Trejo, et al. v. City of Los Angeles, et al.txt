1 I. INTRODUCTION

2 1. On November 6, 2018, the City of Los Angeles, by and through its Advisory
3 Agency and Hearing Officer (*Respondent") approved Vesting Tentative Tract Map Number
4 VTT-74200 to construct a mixed-use development project comprising 725 residential units and
51,600 square feet of ground floor commercial uses for a total floor area of 618,580 square feet

6 on a 4.92-acre site at 129-135 W. College Street and 924 N. Spring Street (Project).

7 Respondent also certified Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") Number ENV-2012-2055-EIR
8 for the Project and adopted findings for the EIR and a Mitigation Monitoring Program.
9 2. Petitioners Josue Othoniel Trejo and the Southwest Regional Council of
10 Carpenters (collectively referred to herein as "Petitioners") challenge the approval of the
11 Project and certification of the EIR on the grounds that the Project does not comply with the
12 California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA-Pub. Resources Code ยง 21000 et seq.) because,
13 inter alia, the EIR fails to provide a stable and finite project description, the EIR's discussion
14 of greenhouse gases, air quality impacts, hazardous materials, and cumulative impacts is
15 | inadequate, and the EIR fails to provide a proper description of the environmental setting. In
16 addition, Petitioners challenge the approval of the Project for being inconsistent with the

17 General Plan in effect at the time of Project approval, in violation of planning and zoning laws
18 and the Subdivision Map Act. Respondent's certification of the EIR and approval of the
19 Project constitutes an abuse of discretion and must be reversed.

20 3. On November 12, 2018, Southwest Carpenters appealed the decision of
21 Respondent, by and through its Advisory Agency and Hearing Officer. However, the
22 a Respondent filed a Notice of Determination, and, pursuant to Public Resources Code Section
23 21167, this action was filed within 30 days thereof out of an abundance of caution.
24 II. PARTIES

25 4. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference Paragraphs 1 through 3 as if fully

26 set forth herein.

27 5. Josue Othoniel Trejo is taxpayer and resident of the City of Los Angeles,
28 where the Project is located.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

6. Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters is a labor union representing 50,000
2 union carpenters in six states, including in southern California, and has a strong interest in well
3 ordered land use planning and addressing the environmental impacts of development projects, 4 such as the Project. Members of Petitioner Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters reside in the City and in the County of Los Angeles, and include residents affected by the Project, whose 6 interests will be adversely affected by the violations of CEQA and approval of the Project in
7 violation of planning and zoning laws and the Subdivision Map Act. Southwest Regional 8 Council of Carpenters submitted comments on the Project that addressed the inadequacies of Respondent's environmental review and violations of planning and zoning laws and the
10 Subdivision Map Act.
11 7. Respondent City of Los Angeles, acting by and through its Advisory Agency 12 and Hearing Officer, is a charter city. On November 6, 2018, Respondent issued a Letter of
13 Determination memorializing its actions at its September 26, 2018 hearing on the Project. On 14 November 15, 2018, a Notice of Determination was filed with the County Clerk of the County 15 of Los Angeles for Respondent's certification of the EIR. While Petitioners properly requested 16 notification, Respondent failed to notify Petitioners of the filing of the Notice of Determination,
17 as required by law.

18 8. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, or otherwise, of 19 Does through 15, are unknown to Petitioners who therefore sue said Respondents by such 20 fictitious names and will seek leave to amend this Petition for Writ of Mandamus when their
21 identities have been ascertained.

22 9. Petitioners are informed and believe that at all times herein alleged,
23 Respondents and each of them were the agents and employees of each of the remaining
24 Respondents and while doing the things herein alleged, were acting within the course and
25 scope of such agency and employment.
26 10. Real Party in Interest Atlas Capital Group LLC is listed on the Notice of 27 Determination as the Project applicant and Real Party in Interest. On information and belief, 28 and on this basis, Petitioners allege, Atlas Capital Group LLC applied for and received

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 approvals from Respondent for the Project.

2 11. Real Party in Interest Chinatown Station Owner LLC is identified as the Project

3 applicant in the EIR for the Project. While not required to name Chinatown Station Owner

4 LLC as a Real Party in Interest (see Pub. Resources Code ยง 21167.6.5), on information and

5 belief, and on this basis, Petitioners allege, Chinatown Station Owner LLC applied for and

6 received approvals for the Project from Respondent.

7 12. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, or otherwise, of
8 Does 16 through 30, are unknown to Petitioners who therefore sue said Real Parties in Interest

9 by such fictitious names and will seek leave to amend this Petition for Writ of Mandamus

10 when their identities have been ascertained.

11 13. Petitioners are informed and believe that at all times herein alleged, Real Parties
12 in Interest and each of them were the agents and employees of each of the remaining Real

13 Parties in Interest and while doing the things herein alleged, were acting within the course and

14 scope of such agency and employment.

15 III. STANDING

16 14. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs through 13 as if fully

17 set forth herein.

18 15. Approval of the Project will adversely affect the interests of Petitioner Josue

19 Othoniel Trejo. Petitioner Josue Othoniel Trejo is an individual dedicated to the protection of

20 the environment and orderly land use planning in the City and in the County of Los Angeles by

21 participating in local environmental and land use policy decision making. Petitioner Josue

22 Othoniel Trejo is a resident in the City of Los Angeles and is affected by the Project, and

23 whose interests in preservation of the environmental integrity of, and land use planning within,

24 the County will be adversely affected by the lack of proper environmental review under CEQA

25 and approval of the Project. Petitioner is also a member of Petitioner Southwest Regional

26 Council of Carpenters. Petitioner is an "aggrieved person" within the meaning of Public

27 Resources Code ยง 21177.

28 16. Approval of the Project will adversely affect the interests of Petitioner

P Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters and its members. Said organization is a labor union 2 that is dedicated to also preserving the quality of the environment and ensuring orderly land use planning for its members, including those residing in the County of Los Angeles. 4 Approval of the Project and certification of the EIR will adversely affect these interests of 5 Petitioner Southwest Regional council of Carpenters and its members. Members and 6 representatives of Petitioner Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters, on behalf thereof, 7 have submitted comments on and objections to the lack of compliance with CEQA and land 8 use laws during the administrative proceedings where the Project was considered. Accordingly, 9 Petitioner Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters is an "aggrieved person" within the 10| meaning of Public Resources Code ยง 21177. The claims asserted and relief requested are 11 broad-based, so that participation in the litigation by individual members is not required. 12 17. Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to California Code of Civil 13 Procedure ยงยง 1085 and 1094.5; California Public Resources Code ยง 21167; CEQA Guidelines 14|ยง 15112; the Constitution of the State of California; the Constitution of the United States; and 15 other applicable laws and regulations.
16 IV. EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES
17 18. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 17 as if fully 18 set forth herein.

19 19. Petitioners have performed all conditions precedent to the filing of this Petition 20 by themselves or others, raising each and every issue known to them before Respondent, in compliance with Public Resources Code ยง 21177, Code of Civil Procedure ยงยง 1085 and 1094.5, 21

22 and other applicable laws.

23 20. Notice of the filing of this action as required by Public Resources Code ยง 24 21167.5 was mailed to Respondent on December 13, 2018. (Letter and Proof of Service are

1 V. FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION Violation 2 of the California Environmental Quality Act [Public Resources Code ยง 21000 et seq-] 3 21. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 20 as if fully 4 set forth herein.
5 22. Respondent's approval of the EIR constitutes an abuse of discretion because, 6 inter alia, the EIR fails to provide a stable and finite project description, the EIR's discussion 7 of greenhouse gases, air quality impacts, hazardous materials, and cumulative impacts is inadequate, and the EIR fails to provide a proper description of the environmental setting. 9 23. The EIR must contain an accurate and stable project description in order to be 10 considered adequate as an informational document. (14 Cal. Code Regs. ยง 15124.) Failure to 11 provide a stable and finite project description defeats the informational purposes of CEQA and 12 invalidates the EIR. (County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 192- 13 193.) Here, the EIR for the Project does not contain a stable and finite project description, in 14 violation of CEQA.
15 24. An EIR must "include a description of the physical environmental conditions in 16 the vicinity of the project, as they exist at the time the notice of preparation is published." (14 17 Cal. Code Regs. ยง 15125(a).) Respondent did not adequately evaluate, disclose, or describe 18 baseline environmental conditions in regard to a variety of resource categories, including 19 hazards and hazardous materials.
20 25. Respondent improperly relied on thresholds of significance they have not 21 themselves adopted. California law requires Respondent to determine the Project's 22 contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. CEQA Guidelines allow an agency to determine the 23 significance of Project-level greenhouse gas impacts, for instance, by setting quantitative 24 emissions thresholds and by determining consistency with a Climate Action Plan, consisting of 25 regulations "adopted by the relevant public agency through a public review process." (14 Cal. 26 Code Regs. ยง 15064.4(b).) To be relied on as mitigation, this plan must actively "reduce or 27 mitigate the project's incremental contribution of greenhouse gas emissions." (14 Cal. Code 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

Regs. ยง 15064.4(b).)

2 26: Respondent evaluates the consistency of the Project with, inter alia, the
3 California Air Resources Board's AB 32 Scoping Plan ("Scoping Plan") to conclude Project-
4 level impacts under this significance threshold are less than significant prior to mitigation. The
5 Scoping Plan is a statewide plan designed to reduce certain categories of greenhouse gases
6 consistent with the mandate of the State greenhouse gas laws. However, Center for Biological
7 Diversity V. California Department of Fish and Wildlife (2015) 620 Cal.4th 204, noted that the
Scoping Plan was not designed or intended to be used at the Project-level. That case held that,
9 to rely on the Scoping Plan, an agency, such as Respondent, must provide analysis that
10 adequately explains why application of the Scoping Plan at the Project-level would be suitable
11 under the circumstances. Respondent provided no such analysis and, thus, Respondent's use of
12 the Scoping Plan is erroneous. (14 Cal. Code Regs. ยง 15064.4(b).) In addition, Respondent's
13 use of the Scoping Plan did not serve to "reduce or mitigate the project's incremental
14 contribution of greenhouse gas emissions,' as required by law. (14 Cal. Code Regs. con
15 15064.4(b).)

16 27. Further, Respondent's evaluation of consistency with plans not adopted by
17 Respondent for the purpose of reducing greenhouse gas impacts at the Project level was
18 confusing and failed to serve the informational purposes of CEQA. Respondent's failure to
19 consider a quantified greenhouse gas emissions threshold cannot be seen as a good faith effort
20 at disclosing the significance of Project-related greenhouse gas impacts. (14 Cal. Code Regs. ยง
21 15064.4(a).)

22 28. Respondent failed to provide an adequate discussion of Project-related impacts
23 and mitigation measures, including cumulative impacts. CEQA requires Respondent to
24 consider the direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental impacts of the Project, and to adopt
25 all feasible mitigation needed to reduce Project-related impacts. (14 Cal. Code Regs. ยงยง
26 15126.2; 15130.) The analysis in the EIR failed to accurately disclose the significant
27 environmental effect of the Project, including its direct, indirect, and cumulative effects.
28 Furthermore, Respondent failed to accurately describe and implement all feasible mitigation

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

measures.

2 29. Respondent must prepare an adequate EIR that conforms with all of the
3 procedural and substantive requirements set forth under CEQA. Approval of the Project EIR, 4 which lacked both procedural and substantive requirements under CEQA, constitutes an abuse of discretion and a failure to proceed in a manner required by law.
6 VI. SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
7 Violation of Planning and Zoning Laws and the Subdivision Map Aet
30. oo Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 29 as if fully

9 set forth herein.

31. The 10 State planning and zoning laws require that land use decisions made by
11 Respondent must be consistent with Respondent's General Plan. The Project violates these
12 requirements. The Project is inconsistent with the City of Los Angeles Central City North

13 Community Plan, which is part of the General Plan. The General Plan Land Use Map
14 currently in effect for the Project site mandates the following:
For residential and mixed-use projects, the first 1.5:1 FAR of residential use shall be 15 permitted to be market rate units. Residential uses with FARS 1.5:1 to 3:1 shall set
in 16 aside 20% of their units for affordable housing. Residential projects with FARS excess of 3:1 shall set aside 100% of the units above the 3:1 threshold as affordable 17 units.

18 32. Because the Project would have a floor-area ratio (FAR) of between 2.7:1 and
19 as affordable housing units. 3:1, it is required to set aside twenty percent of all Project units
20 The Project would construct and set aside no affordable housing units, in violation of the clear
21 language of the General Plan. While the Draft EIR originally described a Development
22 Agreement and General Plan Amendment that would have conformed the Project to be
23 consistent with the General Plan, Respondent ultimately removed the General Plan
24 Amendment and Development Agreement from the Project. The resulting Project approval is 25 inconsistent with the General Plan.

26 33. In addition, Respondent erroneously approved the Vesting Tentative Tract Map
27 for the Project. The Subdivision Map Act requires Respondent to disapprove a Vesting
28 Tentative Tract Map if this map is inconsistent with the General Plan. (Gov. Code ยงยง

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 66473(a); 66474.60; 66474.61(a).) Respondent's Subdivision Map Act findings that the 2 Project is consistent with the General Plan and other planning and zoning laws are unsupported 3 by substantial evidence. (Gov. Code 66474.61(a).) Approval of a Vesting Tentative Tract 4 Map that is inconsistent with the General Plan constitutes an abuse of discretion and a failure 5 to proceed in a manner required by law and is a violation of planning and zoning laws and the 6 Subdivision Map Act.

7 VII. ATTORNEYS' FEES
8 34. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 33 as if fully set forth herein.

10 35. In pursuing this action, Petitioners will confer a substantial benefit on the
11 People of the State of California and therefore are entitled to recover from Respondent and
12 Real Parties reasonable attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to California Code of Civil
13 Procedure 8 1021.5 and other provisions of the law.
14 VIII. INJUNCTION
15 36. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 35 as if fully
16 set forth herein.

17 37. An actual controversy has arisen concerning Respondent's failure to comply
18 with CEQA (Pub. Resources Code $ 21000 et seq.) and planning and zoning laws and the 19 Subdivision Map Act, as set forth above.

20 38: As a result of the above-alleged violations of CEQA and planning and zoning 21 laws, Respondent has failed to adhere to the mandates of planning and zoning laws and the
22 Subdivision Map Act and conduct adequate environmental review as required by law and, thus,
23 has failed to a proceed in a manner required by law in approving the Project.
24 39. At all times mentioned herein, Respondent has been able to comply with CEQA,
25 prepare adequate environmental review, and comply with all relevant provisions of law. 26 Notwithstanding such an ability, Respondent has failed and continues to fail to perform its duty
27 to comply with CEQA, planning and zoning laws and the Subdivision Map Act, and all other 28 relevant provisions of law.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 0

40. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that Respondent is
2 threatening to proceed with development of the Project in the near future. Said implementation

3 of the Project will irreparably harm the environment and will result in significant and

4 unmitigated adverse environmental impacts.

41. Petitioners possess no speedy, adequate remedy at law, in that implementation

6 and development in connection with the Project will permanently and forever harm, injure,

7 degrade, and impact the environmental values of the City, the County of Los Angeles, and the
8 State of California. Petitioners will suffer irreparable and permanent injuries if Respondent's
actions described herein are not set aside.

10 42. A stay and/or restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunction

11 should issue restraining Respondent from proceeding with development of the Project.

12 43. In order to preserve the status quo, a stay and/or restraining order and

13 preliminary and permanent injunction should issue staying Respondent's approval of the

14 Project and certification of the EIR.

15 PRAYER

16 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as follows:

17 1. For Alternative and Peremptory Writs of Mandate ordering Respondent to set

18 aside any and all Project approvals including, but not limited to the approval of Vesting
19 Tentative Tract Map Number VTT-74200 for the merger and re-subdivision of a 4.92-acre site

20 into one master lot in conjunction with the construction of the Project and certification of EIR

21 Number ENV-2012-2055-EIR, unless and until Respondent takes all necessary steps to bring

22 its actions into compliance with CEQA.

23 2. For an order staying Respondent or other Project applicants from engaging in

24 any activity pursuant to the Project until the environmental review and the Project complies

25 with California statutes and regulations, including but not limited to the requirements of CEQA,

26 and until Respondent abides by the procedural requirements set forth in all relevant State and
27 local planning and zoning laws.
