COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO - HALL OF JUSTICE

11 SAN DIEGANS FOR OPEN GOVERNMENT, CASENO.

12 Plaintiff and Petitioner, VERIFIED COMPLAINT DECLARATORY RELIEF FOR
AND
13 VS. PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE UNDER THE CALIFORNIA
14 CITY OF SAN DIEGO; and DOES 1 through 100, ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT AND OTHER LAWS
15 Defendants and Respondents;

16 DOES 101 through 1,000,

17 Defendants and Real Parties in Interest.

18

19 Plaintiff and Petitioner SAN DIEGANS FOR OPEN GOVERNMENT ('Petitioner") alleges as

20| follows:

21 Parties

22 1. Petitioner is a non-profit organization formed and operating under the laws of the State

23 of California. At least one of Petitioner's members resides in, or near, the City of San Diego,

24 California, and has an interest in, among other things, ensuring open, accountable, and responsive
25 government and in protecting the City's quality of life.

26 2. Defendant and Respondent CITY OF SAN DIEGO ("CITY") is a "public agency" under
27 Section 21063 of the Public Resources Code and a "local government" under Section 30109 of the
28 Public Resources Code. As a "public agency," CITY is required to comply with California

seq. As a "local Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code Section 21000 et
2 government," CITY is also required to comply with the California Coastal Act ("Coastal Act"), Public
3 Resources Code Section 30000 et seq.

3. The true names and capacities of the Defendants/Respondents/Real Parties in Interest

5 identified as DOES 1 through 1,000 are unknown to Petitioner, who will seek the Court's permission
6 to amend this pleading in order to allege the true names and capacities as soon as they are ascertained.
Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that each of the fictitiously named DOES

8 through 100 has jurisdiction by law over one or more aspects of the proposed project that is the
9 subject of this proceeding and DOES 101 through 1,000 has some other cognizable interest in the
10. subject matter of this lawsuit.
11 Background Information

12 4. CITY implements and administers a local coastal program ("LCP") that was certified
13 by the California Coastal Commission as being consistent with the Coastal Act. Generally speaking,
I4 the LCP applies to all development and land uses in CITY's portion of the "coastal zone" as defined
15 by Public Resources Code Section 30103.
16 5. CITY's LCP includes the Mission Bay Park Master Plan ("Master Plan"). The Master
17 Plan was adopted by CITY's city council in 1994, approved by the California Coastal Commission
18 thercafter, subsequently subjected to judicial review, approved with modifications by the Commission
19 in 1996, which modifications were adopted by CIT'Y's city council in 1997. The modifications included
20 but were not limited to the insertion of the words "Retain Gleason Road" on Figure 12 (depicting the
21 Bahia Point Development Area) of the Master Plan.
22 6. On or about October 3, 2018, CITY exercised its discretion and made an "administrative
23 correction" to Figure 12 in the Master Plan by deleting the words "Retain Gleason Road" (*Project").
24 The Project was approved unilaterally by CITY's director of the planning department (and not by the
25. city council) without any prior public notice, public input, or the posting of a Notice of Right to Appeal
26 Environmental Determination ("NORA") as mandated by San Diego Municipal Code Section
27 112.0310(a). As a result, the Master Plan no longer requires CITY or any developer to maintain the
28 public's access to Mission Bay via Gleason Road, contrary to decisions made more than 20 ycars ago.

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ETC. Page 2

...

1 7. Petitioner opposes the Project based on CITY's lack of transparency and failure to abide
2 by all applicable laws. The Project violates CITY's LCP and/or effectively amends it (without approval

3

4 from the California Coastal Commission) by substantially curtailing public access to coastal resources
on Mission Bay and without compliance with CEQA.

5

8. Notice Requirements and Time Limitations
This procceding is being commenced not more than 35 days after the notice described

8 in Public Resources Code Section 21167(d) was filed with the county clerk (if such a notice was filed).

9. Petitioner has caused a Notice of Commencement of Action to be served on
9 Defendants/Respondents, as required by Public Resources Code Section 21167.5. A true and correct
10 copy of the Notice of Commencement of Action is attached to this pleading as Exhibit "A."

11 10.

12 Petitioner will have caused a copy of this pleading to be served on the Attorney General
not more than 10 days after the commencement of this lawsuit, as required by Public Resources Code
13 Section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure Section 388.

14

15 Jurisdiction and Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies

11. Petitioner seeks review by and relief from this Court under Public Resources Code
16 Sections 21168, 21168.5, and/or 30802, as applicable, and Code of Civil Procedure Sections 526a, 1060
17 et seq., and 1084 et seq., among other provisions of law.

18 12. Petitioner was not required to exhaust administrative remedies because CITY failed to
19 provide any public notice or hearing prior to approving the Project.

20 13. Defendants/Respondents' conduct in approving the Project without complying with
21 CEQA, the Coastal Act, and the San Diego Municipal Code ("SDMC") constitutes a prejudicial abuse
22

23 of discretion because, as alleged in this pleading, they failed to proceed in a manner required by law.
14. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, since
24| its members and other members of the public will suffer irreparable harm as a result of
25 Defendants/Respondents' violations of CEQA, the Coastal Act, and other applicable laws.
26 Defendants/Respondents' approval of the Project also rests on their failure to satisfy a clear, present,

27 ministerial duty to act in accordance with the applicable laws. Even when Defendants/Respondents are
28 permitted or required by law to exercise their discretion in approving projects under those laws, they

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RBLIBF ETC. Page 3

remain under a clear, present, ministerial duty to exercise their discretion within the limits of and in a
2 manner consistent with those laws. Defendants/Respondents have had and continue to have the capacity

3 and ability to approve the Project within the time limits of and in a manner consistent with those laws,
but Defendants/Respondents have failed and refused to do so and have exercised their discretion beyond
the limits of and in a manner that is not consistent with those laws.

15. Petitioner has a beneficial right and interest in Defendants/Respondents' fulfillment of
all their legal duties, as alleged in this pleading.

8 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION:

9 Illegal Approval of Project (Against All Defendants/Respondents and Real Parties in Interest)

10 16. Paragraphs through 15 are fully incorporated into this paragraph.
11 17. The Project does not comply with all applicable laws. By way of example and not
12| limitation (including alternative theories of liability):
13 A. The Project violates CEQA. In particular:
14 i. CEQA applies to every discretionary project proposed to be carried out

15 or approved by a public agency, unless the project is exempt from CEQA. Generally speaking, the
16 public agency must review the potentially significant environmental impacts of every discretionary
17 project subject to CEQA review that the agency proposes to carry out or approve. Such review involves
18 determining whether the proposal is exempt, should be the subject of a negative declaration, or should
19 | be the subject of an environmental impact report.

20 ii. The use of a CEQA exemption is inappropriate when a project may have

21 significant environmental impacts or when there are potentially significant environmental impacts due
22 to unusual circumstances.

23 iii. The Project constitutes a "project" under CEQA because its approval
24 involved the exercise of discretion and has the potential to cause significant direct, indirect, or
25 cumulative adverse impacts (if not all such impacts) on the environment, including but not limited to

26 conflicts in Defendants/Respondents' land-use and zoning regulations.
27

28

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ETC. Page 4

1 iv. These significant direct, indirect, or cumulative adverse impacts on the
2 environment give rise to Defendants/Respondents' legal obligation to subject the Project to CEQA

3 review.

4 V. Defendants/Respondents' refusal to apply CEQA to the Project and

5 subject it to environmental review constitutes a violation of CEQA.

.. 6 vi. As a result of Defendants/Respondents' violation of CEQA, Petitioner
1 .0 ...m has been harmed insofar as Petitioner, its members, other members of the public, and the responsible
8 decision-makers were not fully informed about the potential adverse environmental impacts of the
.... . . 9 Project, and insofar as Petitioner, its members, and other members of the public did not have an

10 opportunity to participate meaningfully in the analysis of such impacts prior to approval of the Project.
.......1 11 B. The Project violates the Coastal Act. In particular:

12 i. Public Resources Code Section 30512(a) provides in part as follows: "The
.â€¢
13 land use plan of a proposed local coastal program shall be submitted to the commission. The
..- -.. ... a.m 14 commission shall, within 90 days after the submittal, after public hearing, either certify or refuse
15 certification, in whole or in part, the land use plan pursuant to the following procedure. . . ."

16 ii. Public Resources Code Section 30514(a) provides as follows: "A certified

17 local coastal program and all local implementing ordinances, regulations, and other actions may be
18 amended by the appropriate local government, but no such amendment shall take effect until it has been
19 certified by the commission."

20 iti. The Project has never been submitted to the California Coastal
21 Commission, has not been certified by the Commission, and thus has no legal force or effect even

22 though Defendants/Respondents insist that it does have legal force and effect.

23 iv. As a result of Defendants/Respondents' violation of the Coastal Act,

24 Petitioner has been harmed insofar as Petitioner, its members, other members of the public have not
25 received the protection of California Coastal Commission oversight of the Project to ensure that it
26 complies with the public-access and other policies of the Coastal Act.
27

28

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ETC. Page 5

1 C. The Project violates the SDMC. In particular:

2 i. CITY was required by the SDMC to determine whether CEQA applies
3 to the Project. The determination entitles anyone who disagrees with it to appeal to CITY's city

4 council.

5 ii. CEQA failed to make the requisite determination as to CEQA's

6 applicability to the Project.
iii. As a result of Defendants/Respondents' violation of the SDMC, Petitioner
8 has been harmed insofar as Petitioner, its members, other members of the public have not received the

9 protection afforded through compliance with the SDMC.
18. There is currently dispute between Petitioner and Defendants/Respondents over the
11 Project's legal force and effect, Petitioner contends that the Project has no legal force or effect because
12 it violates CEQA, the Coastal Act, the SDMC, and/or one or more other applicable laws.

13 Defendants/Respondents dispute Petitioner's contention. The parties therefore require a judicial
14 determination of the Project's legal force and effect (if any).

15 Prayer

16 FOR ALL THESE REASONS, Petitioner respectfully prays for the following relief against

17 Defendants/Respondents (and any and all other parties who may oppose Petitioner in this proceeding):
18 A. A judgment or other appropriate order determining or declaring that

19 Defendants/Respondents failed to fully comply with CEQA, the Coastal Act, the SDMC, and/or one
20 or more other applicable laws as they relate to the Project and that there must be full compliance
21 therewith before final approval and implementation of the Project may occur;
22 B. A judgment or other appropriate order determining or declaring that
23 Defendants/Respondents failed to comply with CEQA, the Coastal Act, the SDMC, and/or one or more
24| other applicable laws as they relate to the Project and that its approval and implementation was illegal
25 in at least some respect, rendering the approval and implementation null and void;
26 C. Injunctive relief prohibiting Defendants/Respondents (and any and all persons acting at
27 the request of, in concert with, or for the benefit of one or more of them) from taking any action on any
28

1

2 aspect of, in furtherance of, or otherwise based on the Project unless and until Defendants/Respondents

3 comply with CEQA, the Coastal Act, SDMC, and all other applicable laws, as determined by the Court;
D.

4 Any and all other relief that may be authorized by CEQA, the Coastal Act, the SDMC,
or other applicable laws, or any combination of them, but is not explicitly or specifically requested
5 elsewhere in this Prayer;

6 E. Any and all legal fees and other expenses incurred by Petitioner in connection with this
proceeding, including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees as authorized by the Code of Civil
8 Procedure; and
Lo F.

10 Any and all further relief that this Court may deem appropriate.
Date: November 1, 2018.
