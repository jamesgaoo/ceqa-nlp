13 NH3, LLC'; JAMES MERRITT; and GRANNUS, LLC, (collectively, "Calamco,"
14 "Applicant," or "Real Parties"). Petitioners challenge: the Air District's November 21, 2017
15 approval of Authority to Construct (S-8943-1-0) ("ATC") for the Applicant's anhydrous
16 ammonia manufacturing facility and cogeneration power plant, No. N-1163737 ("Project");
17

18 the Air District's November 21, 2017 Permit Exemption Determination, exempting the

19 ammonia loop purge vent, ammonia plant stack vent, acid gas removal system/CO2 vent, and

20 flare components of the Project from permitting ("Permit Exemption Determination"); the

21 Air District's November 22, 2017 Notice of Determination, SCH No. 1991122017 ("NOD");

22 the Air District's February 28, 2018 decision to deny Petitioners' appeal to the Hearing

23 Board and to uphold the Air District's approvals of the ATC and Permit Exemption

24 Determination; and the Air District's decision to withhold emissions data from public
disclosure.

25 2.

26 The Project is a new anhydrous ammonia manufacturing facility with an

27 integrated combined-cycle gas turbine ("CCGT") cogeneration power plant (*cogen") and

28 CALAMCO NH3, LLC filed a name change to Taft Ammonia Company, LLC on November 17, 2017 in the state of Delaware.

1 associated, required components, including, but not limited to, the ammonia loop purge vent,

2 ammonia plant stack vent, acid gas removal system/CO2 vent, and flare. On information and

3 belief, the Project also includes an air separation unit ("ASU"), which would physically

4 separate oxygen and nitrogen from atmospheric air and supply these gases to the ammonia

5 manufacturing plant, and a new 6-mile natural a gas pipeline, which would supply natural gas

6 as feedstock to the ammonia manufacturing plant and as fuel supply to the cogen.

7 3. The Project would be located at the South Kern Industrial Center, also

8 referred to as the South Kern Industrial Complex ("SKIC") located near the intersection of

9 Santiago and Lake Roads in unincorporated Kern County, California (Section 13, T32S,

10 R25E, MDBM Vesting Tentative Parcel Map No. 12149), with the exception of the

11 aforementioned pipeline, which would run lateral from the Kern River Pipeline to the Project

12 site.

13 4. Respondents' approval of the ATC, issuance of the Permit Exemption

14 Determination, and issuance and filing of the NOD (collectively, "Project Approvals")
15 constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failure to proceed in a manner required by a

16 law, in violation of the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code

17 (*PRC"') section 21000, et seq., California Environmental Quality Act Guidelines, Title 14,

18 California Code of Regulations ("CCR"), § 15000 et seq. (collectively, "CEQA), California

19 Health and Safety Code ("H&S Code") section 39000, et seq. and the Air District's rules and
20 regulations.

21 5. The Air District violater CEQA by (1) failing to provide notice of the Permit

22 Exemption Determination, (2) failing to provide environmental analysis or findings for the

23 Permit Exemption Determination, (3) unlawfully segmenting the Project, (4) failing to

24 include the "whole of an action" in the NOD, (5) failing to mail the NOD, (6) failing to

25 make the record available, (7) failing to make findings, adopt a statement of overriding
26 considerations, apply feasible mitigation measures or feasible alternatives; (8) and, in the

27 alternative, failing to support its findings and statement of overriding consideration with

28 2

substantial evidence.

2 6. The Air District violated the H&S Code by failing to act in accordance with

3 its rules when it exempted the it Project's flare from permitting requirements.

4 7. The Air District also violated the California Public Records Act, Government

5 Code section 6250, et seq., by improperly withholding Project emissions data from public

6 disclosure.

7 8. Petitioners seek a writ of mandate requiring the Air District to rescind the

8 ATC, Permit Exemption Determination, and NOD, to require the Air District to fully comply

9 with CEQA, the H&S Code and the Air District's rules and regulations before issuing any
10 permits, exemptions and/or other actions for the Project, and to comply with the Public
11 Records Act by disclosing Project emissions data.

12 PARTIES

13 Petitioners and Plaintiffs

14 9. Petitioner and Plaintiff KERN COUNTY CITIZENS FOR RESPONSIBLE
15 DEVELOPMENT ("Citizens") is an unincorporated association of residents and labor

16 organizations that are concerned about public and worker health, safety risks, and

17 environmental impacts from industrial development in the region where Citizens' members
18 and their families live, work and recreate. Members of Citizens will be adversely affected by
19 the Project. Citizens includes Taft, Kern County, residents David Carnahan and Justin

20 Callison and California Unions for Reliable Energy, its participating organizations, and the
21 organizations' members and their families, as well as other individuals who live, work and/or

22 recreate in South Kern County and other areas of Kern County.

23 10. Citizens and its members are beneficially interested in this proceeding.
24 Citizens' members include residents of Taft and South Kern County near the Project site.
25 Citizens' members appreciate the region's environmental qualities, rich biological diversity,
26 delicate water resources, and safe working facilities and opportunities in the agricultural,
27 commercial, and industrial sectors. Their interests in public health and safety, property and
28 3
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR

4108-029acp INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 property values, safe roadways, air quality, water quality and availability, and biological

2 resources, among other interests, will be adversely affected if the Project is developed

3 without proper disclosure of emissions data, and without proper analysis and mitigation of its

4 environmental impacts. Additionally, their interests in public health and safety, property and

5 property values, safe roadways, air quality, water quality and availability, and biological

6 resources, among other interests, will be adversely affected if the Project avoids adequate

7 environmental review under CEQA or adequate permitting under the H&S Code and the Air

8 District's rules and regulations.

0 11. Citizens was formed to advocate for responsible, safe, and sustainable

10 development in Kern County to help ensure the long-term health and safety of the region's

11 residents, environment, and economy, while at the same time protecting the areas where its

12 members and their families live, work and recreate. Members of Citizens live, work,

13 recreate, and commute near the SKIC. Citizens' members may also suffer adverse health,

14 economic, and environmental impacts caused by the Project's impacts.

15 12. Citizens participated in the ATC approval process on the matters being

16 challenged in this Petition and Complaint to the extent notice was provided and such
17 participation was permitted and not futile, and are beneficially interested in this proceeding.

18 Citizens wanted to participate in an administrative process, pursuant to the H&S Code and

19 the Air District's rules and regulations, and CEQA review process for the Project and Project

20 Approvals so that they could review the Project's compliance with laws, environmental

21 impacts and mitigation measures.

23 interest in tax-funded public works, including roads near the SKIC, and the public resources

24 present in Kern County's natural areas, including, but not limited to, the air and water

25 resources and rare and protected species therein. Citizens and its members' interests in

26 lawful, orderly, consistent, and environmentally sound project approvals by the Air District

27 will be adversely affected if the Air District's approvals related to the Project are allowed to

28 4
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR

to protect in this proceeding are germane to its purposes.

4 14. Petitioner and Plaintiff CALIFORNIA UNIONS FOR RELIABLE ENERGY

5 ("CURE") is a member of Citizens. CURE is a coalition of labor organizations whose

6 members construct, operate, and maintain power plants and other industrial facilities
throughout California. CURE encourages sustainable development of California's energy

8 and natural resources. Environmental degradation destroys cultural and wildlife areas,

( consumes limited fresh water resources, causes air and water pollution, and imposes other
10 stresses on people and the environmental carrying capacity of the State. This in turn

11 jeopardizes future development by causing construction moratoriums and otherwise reducing
12 future employment opportunities for CURE's participating organizations and their members.

13 15. CURE and its participating organizations and their members participated in

14 the ATC approval process on the matters being challenged in this Petition and Complaint to
15 the extent notice was provided and such participation was permitted and not futile, and are

16 beneficially interested in this proceeding. CURE and its participating organizations and their

22 members possess an ownership interest in tax-funded public works, including roads near the

23 SKIC, and the public resources present in Kern County's natural areas, including but not
24 limited to, the air and water resources and rare and protected species therein. CURE and its
25 participating organizations and their members' interests in lawful, orderly, consistent, and

26 environmentally sound project approvals by the Air District will be adversely affected if the
27 Air District's approvals related to the Project are allowed to proceed as approved without

17 interest in the Air District's compliance with the laws bearing upon approval of the Project.

18 Mr. Carnahan has been and will be directly and adversely affected by the Air District's

19 approval of the Project and the significant, unmitigated environmental impacts resulting from

20 the approvals that violate planning, zoning and land use laws, CEQA, H&S Code, the Air

21 District's rules and regulations, and Public Records Act. As a resident, worker and
22 recreationalist of the region impacted by the Project, Mr. Carnahan is within the class of

23 persons to whom the Air District owes such duties. Furthermore, Mr. Carnahan will suffer

24 direct injury in the form of diminished quality of life as a result of the adverse environmental
25 impacts the Project will generate.

18 Records Act. As a resident, worker and recreationalist of the region impacted by the Project,

19 Mr. Callison is within the class of persons to whom the Air District owes such duties.

20 complying with the requirements of PRC section 21167.6.5 by naming real parties in interest.

21 IRREPARABLE HARM

22 41. Petitioners have 110 plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary

23 law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside
24 the ATC, Permit Exemption Determination, and NOD. In the absence of such remedies,

25 Respondents' actions will remain in effect, in violation of state law. If Real Parties in

26 Interest construct the Project, pursuant to Respondents' flawed approvals, Petitioners, the

27 environment and the general public will be irreparably harmed. No money damages could

28 13
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF
4108-029acp

adequately compensate for that harm. A temporary restraining order and preliminary and

2 permanent injunctions should issue restraining Respondents and Real Parties in Interest from
3 proceeding with the Project.

4 STATEMENT OF FACTS

5 42. In 1992, the County of Kern ("County") approved the South Kern Industrial

6 Center ("SKIC") Specific Plan and an Environmental Impact Report ("1992 EIR") for the

7 plan that identified significant environmental impacts and required mitigation measures. The

8 1992 EIR also identified significant unavoidable impacts for which the County by law was

9 required to make findings and adopt a statement of overriding considerations.

10 43. In 2002, an organic waste recycling facility was proposed to be constructed in

11 the SKIC. The County of Kern certified and adopted a Supplemental EIR ("2002 SEIR") to

12 revise the SKIC Specific Plan and approved a Conditional Use Permit for the organic waste

13 recycling facility, SCH No. 1991122017. Like the 1992 EIR, the 2002 SEIR identified

14 significant environmental impacts and required mitigation measures. The 2002 SEIR also

15 identified significant unavoidable impacts for which the County made a statement of
16 overriding considerations. One of those significant unavoidable impacts was on air quality.

17 44. The Applicant intends to construct and operate an anhydrous ammonia
18 manufacturing facility and cogeneration power plant that would be located at the SKIC. On
19 information and belief, the Project would also require construction of an air separation unit

20 ("ASU") and 6-mile pipeline.

21 45. On or about February 9, 2016, the Applicant submitted a pre-application

22 Emissions Report for the Project. On or about June 16, 2016, the Applicant submitted a pre-

23 application Combined Cycle Gas Turbine Plant Emission Report for the Project. On or about

24 December 9, 2016, the Applicant submitted a pre-application Combined Cycle Start-up

25 Emissions Report for the Project. On or about December 12, 2016, the Applicant submitted

26 an ATC application for the Project.

46. On July 20, 2016, CURE sent a letter to Mr. Sadredin, Executive Director, and

2 Michelle Franco, Clerk of the Board, requesting mailed notice of any and all CEQA actions

3 and public hearings related to the Project. The letter was written pursuant to PRC sections

4 21092.2, 21080.4, 21083.9, 21092, 21108 and 21152 and Government Code section 65092,

5 requiring local agencies to mail such notices to any person who has filed a written request for

6 them with the clerk of the agency's government board.

7 47. Petitioners' also signed up for all Air District permitting notices

8 at http://www.valleyair.org/busind/pto/Permitting_Notification.htm.Petitionershave

9 received notices from the Air District about various projects since February 24, 2016 and as

10 recently as December 1, 2017.

11 48. On February 10, 2017, Petitioners submitted a letter to the Air District based

12 on the available records and the highly redacted emissions data that were provided to
13 Petitioners, stating that the Project's fertilizer plant, cogen, ASU and pipeline must be
14 permitted as one stationary source, that the flare does not qualify for an exemption from
15 permitting requirements as a Low Emitting Unit ("LEU"), and that the emissions data in the
16 public record were not sufficient to support the Air District's proposed permitting decision.

17 49. The Air District then prepared an analysis of the Project's flare emissions. Its
18 August 11, 2017 analysis showed that the flare's oxides of nitrogen ("NOx") emissions from

19 pilots (continuous) and sweep gas flaring (continuous) would be 1 lb/day and 363 lb/year.
20 The analysis excluded emergency flaring emissions.

21 50. The Air District's September 25, 2017 Authority to Construct Application

22 Review for the Electric Power Generation System Serving Ammonia Plant ("Application
23 Review") acknowledged that "there may be situations when intermittent/emergency flaring
24 may be necessary." The Air District determined in the Application Review that the flare's
25 potential NOx emissions from one, 20-minute emergency flaring event would be 5.8 lb/day,
26 which exceeds the Air District's LEU threshold of 2 lb/day.

27 51. The Air District's own evidence showed that the flare's emergency flaring
28 15
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF 4108-029acp

emissions would put the flare over the LEU threshold, but the Air District did not include the

2 emergency flaring emissions in the flare's potential uncontrolled emissions when
3  determining whether an ATC was required for the flare.

4 52. On information and belief, Mr. Sadredin and Mr. Marjollet issued the ATC on

5 November 21, 2017, without any prior public comment period or public hearing.

6 53. On November 21, 2017, Mr. Sadredin and Mr. Marjollet issued ATC S-8943-

7 1-0 for:

13 PILOT/PURGE BURNER SERVED BY SELECTIVE CATALYTIC REDUCTION
(SCR) SYSTEM AND CO CATALYST
14

15 54. On information and belief, the Air District's Governing Board did not issue

16 the ATC.

17 55. On or about November 21, 2017, Mr. Marjollet and Mr. Scandura issued the

18 Permit Exemption Determination without any prior public comment period or public hearing.

19 The Permit Exemption Determination exempts the Project's ammonia loop purge vent,

20 ammónia plant stack vent, acid gas removal system/CO2 vent, and flare from ATC permit S-

21 8943-1-0.

22 56. On or about November 22, 2017, Arnaud Marjollet and Brian Clements issued

23 and filed the NOD for the Project without any prior public comment period or public hearing.

24 57. The Air District's Governing Board did not issue the NOD for the Project.

25 58. On information and belief, the Project Approvals will contribute to the SKIC's

26 significant air quality impact.

27

28 16
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF
4108-029acp

1 59. On information and belief, the Project Approvals will contribute to the SKIC's

2 NOx, oxides of sulfur ("SOx"), PM10, Carbon Monoxide ("CO"), and Volatile Organic

3 Compound ("VOC") emissions.

4 60. In particular, the Permit Exemption Determination provides the emissions

5 estimates for the ammonia loop purge vent, ammonia plant stack vent, acid gas removal

6 system/CO2 vent, and flare. For example, the ammonia plant stack vent's potential emissions

7 (uncontrolled) are 61 pounds/year of NOx. The Acid Gas Removal System/CO2 Vent's

8 potential emissions (uncontrolled) are 642 pounds/year of CO.

9 61. The expected SKIC Specific Plan Total Estimated Emissions at Buildout

10 would be 459.8 tons/year of CO and 322.6 of NOx. 2002 SEIR, section 4.3-22. These

11 emissions numbers did not reflect the additional emissions' contribution from the organic

12 waste recycling facility. See id.

13 62. On November 17, 2017 and November 27, 2017, Petitioners submitted two

14 Public Records Act requests to the Air District.

15 63. The November 17, 2017 request sought copies of any and all records related
16 to the Project since Petitioners' May 2, 2017 request. The Air District identified Petitioners'

17 request as Public Records Request C-2017-11-62.

18 64. The November 27, 2017 request was for immediate access to any and all

19 records related to the Project since Petitioners' November 17, 2017 request. The Air District

20 identified Petitioners' request as Public Records Request C-2017-11-80. Petitioners
21 attempted to set up an appointment on Wednesday, November 29, 2017 to inspect the

22 records. On November 28, 2017, the Air District's Public Records Request Coordinator,
23 Noemi Calderon, responded that the records would not be ready for disclosure on the 29th

24 and that the Air District would provide responsive records no later than December 21, 2017.
25 On December 21, the Air District provided some documents responsive to our requests,

26 including the email from Kelly Merritt to Homero Ramirez and others on August 8, 2017 at

27 2:12 AM. Subsequently, while Petitioners prepared the administrative record for this case,

28 17
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR

4108-029acp INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

- the Air District claimed that the record contained confidential information and redacted the

2

3 emissions data, among other information. In addition, the Air District provided Petitioners

4 with highly redacted Emissions Reports, including the February 2016 Emissions Report for

5 the Bridging Phase (Rev. C), the April 21, 2016 Emissions Report (Rev. E), the June 13,

6 2016 Combined Cycle Gas Turbine Plant Emission Report (Rev. B)*, and the December 9,

7 2016 Combined Cycle Start-up Emissions Report (Rev. E) that the Air District stated should

8 be included in the administrative record. The latter two reports were initially provided in

unredacted form.

9 65.

10 On December 20, 2017, Petitioners filed with the Air District's Hearing

11 Board a petition for hearing and appeal of the District staff's issuance of the ATC, Permit

12 Exemption Determination and NOD. Petitioners petitioned for a hearing and appeal on the

13 grounds that: (1) the Project's cogen, fertilizer plant emission units, ASU, and pipeline must

14 be permitted as one stationary source; (2) the flare was improperly exempted from the ATC;

15 (3) substantial evidence based on expert opinion shows that the flare is not a Low Emitting

16 Unit, pursuant to Air District Rule 2020, must have been included in the ATC, and that the

17 Permit Exemption Determination was flawed for having included it; (4) the Air District

18 failed to account for all emissions; and, (5) the Air District violated CEQA as set forth in this
Petition and Complaint.

19 66. In particular, Petitioners concluded that the flare would emit 359.81

20

21 pounds/year of NOx and 515.35 pounds/year of CO. These emissions are higher than the

22 potential emissions (uncontrolled) in the Air District's Permit Exemption Determination for

the flare.

23 67.

24 On February 13, 2018, Petitioners provided to the Air District refined

25 calculations of the flare's potential uncontrolled emissions based on (1) additional

26 information from the Air District and (2) the Air District's standard practice for calculating

27 flare emissions, which includes emissions from emergency flaring. Petitioners showed that

28 The Emission Report indicates it is Rev. A, however, the Air District refers to this document as "CCGT Plant
Emission Report - Rev B Redact."
18
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR

the flare's potential to emit for NOx, PM10, CO and VOC from emergency flaring exceeds

2 the Air District's daily and annual LEU thresholds of 2 lb/day and 75 Ib/year, and, therefore,

3 could not be exempted from the Air District's permit requirements. Consequently the flare

4 needed its own ATC under the Air District's rules.

5 68. On February 14, 2018, the Hearing Board held a hearing on Petitioners' a

6 appeal challenging the Air District's decision to exempt the fertilizer plant flare from

7 permitting requirements as a LEU. Petitioners showed that the flare requires an ATC because

8 the Air District's own rules required the Air District to include emergency flaring emissions

9 in calculating total potential uncontrolled emissions from the flare. The Air District refused.

10 On February 28, 2018, the Air District Hearing Board issued a decision denying Petitioners'
11 appeal and upholding the Air District's issuance of the ATC and Permit Exemption

12 Determination ("Order").

13 69. The Order stated that the flare was properly exempted from permitting
14 requirements because the Air District was not required to include emergency flaring

15 emissions when determining whether the flare is a LEU.

16 70. The Air District provided no substantial evidence for its conclusion that the

17 Air District was not required to include emergency flaring emissions when determining
18 whether the flare is a LEU. a

19 71. On March 1, 2018, the Hearing Board mailed the February 28, 2018 Order to
20 Petitioners.

21 72. On December 21, 2017, Petitioners appealed to the Air District's Governing
22 Board, challenging Air District staff's issuance of the ATC, Permit Exemption

23 Determination, and NOD. As of March 30, 2018, the Air District Governing Board had not

24 responded to Petitioners' appeal.

25 73. Petitioners have performed all conditions precedent to this filing and have
26 participated in the administrative process to the extent notice was provided and such

27

28 19
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF 4108-029acp

participation was permitted and not futile, and thus have fully exhausted their administrative

2 remedies.

3 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

4 Violations of CEQA

5 (Public Resources Code $ 21000 et seq.)

6 74. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate all of the above paragraphs as if fully set

7 forth herein.

8 75. Respondents were at all times under mandatory duty to comply with all

9 requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines. Respondents failed and refused to
10 perform that duty.

11 76. Respondents failed to comply with the requirements of CEQA and the CEQA

12 Guidelines by approving the ATC, issuing the Permit Exemption Determination, and filing

13 the NOD.

14 77. CEQA declares that "the maintenance of a quality environment for the people

15 of this state and in the future is a matter of statewide concern." PRC § 21000(a). CEQA's

16 two basic purposes are to inform the public and governmental decision makers of the
17 environmental consequences of government action and to require public agencies to reduce

18 and avoid harm to the environment. 14 CCR § 15002(a)(1); Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay

19 v. Bd. of Port Comrs. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1354; Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of

20 Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564.

21 78. A Responsible Agency complies with CEQA by considering an EIR prepared

22 by the Lead Agency and by reaching its own conclusions on whether and how to approve the

23 project involved. 14 CCR § 15096(a). Prior to reaching a decision on the project, the
24 Responsible Agency must consider the environmental effects of the project as shown in the

25 EIR. 14 CCR § 15096(f). A Responsible Agency shall not approve the project as proposed if

26 the agency finds any feasible alternative or feasible mitigation measures within its powers

27 that would substantially lessen or avoid any significant effect the project would have on the

28 20
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF
4108-029acp

P environment. 14 CCR § 15096(g)(2). It also shall make findings required by CEQA

2 Guidelines section 15091 for each significant effect of the project, and shall make the

3 findings in CEQA Guidelines section 15093, if necessary. 14 CCR § 15096(h). Finally, the

4 Responsible Agency should file a Notice of Determination in the same manner as a Lead

5 Agency under CEQA Guidelines section 15094. 14 CCR § 15096(g).

6 79. CEQA requires the Court to establish whether an agency abused its discretion

7 by determining whether an agency failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and/or

8 whether the agency's decision is not supported by substantial evidence. PRC$§ 21168;

9 21168.5.

10 80. Based on these legal standards, Respondents abused their discretion,

11 exceeded their jurisdiction and proceeded in a manner a contrary to law and without the
12 support of substantial evidence in the record by committing the following violations:

13 Inadequate Notice for the Permit Exemption Determination

14 81. The Air District's Permit Exemption Determination, which includes
15 conditions of approval, is a "project" within the meaning of Public Resources Code section
16 21065 and was approved by a discretionary decision of the Air District. PRC § 21080(a). §
17 82. The Air District's approval of the Project constitutes a prejudicial abuse of
18 discretion in that the Air District failed to proceed in the manner required by law and its
19 decision is not supported by substantial evidence.

20 83. CEQA requires the Air District to provide legally adequate notice to the
21 general public regarding proposed projects having a potential environmental effect, SO the

22 public can meaningfully participate in a local agency's decision to approve or disapprove a
23 proposed project. PRC § 21002.1(e).

24 84. The Air District did not provide the public with notice of its Permit
25 Exemption Determination at any time. No public notification or acknowledgement regarding
26 environmental review, and, in particular, compliance with CEQA was provided.

27 85. Following issuance of the Permit Exemption Determination, the Air District

28 21
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF 4108-029acp

failed to issue any notifications pursuant to CEQA.

2 No Environmental Analysis or Findings for the Permit Exemption Determination
3 86. Exempting units from Air District permitting requirements is an action that
4

5 may cause a direct or indirect change in the physical environment. The Permit Exemption

6 Determination is a discretionary approval of a project within the meaning of CEQA because

7 the Air District's imposition of conditions on the emissions units to ensure compliance with

8 the exemption and the Air District's regulatory scheme is a discretionary act involving the

9 exercise of judgment.
10 87. The Permit Exemption Determination is an approval within the meaning of
11 CEQA because it authorized construction and operation of emissions units and was the 12

13 "essential step in a chain of events leading to an ultimate environmental impact." County of

14 Amador v. City of Plymouth (3d Dist. 2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 1089, 1105 (citing Kaufman &

15 Broad-South Bay, Inc. V. Morgan Hill Unified School Dist. (6th Dist. 1992) 9 Cal.App.4th

16 464, 474; see also Save Tara v. City of West Hollywood (2008) 45 Cal.4th 115.

17
88.
18 CEQA imposes upon the Air District a clear, present, and mandatory duty to

19 prepare an initial study and consider a negative declaration, a mitigated negative declaration
or an environmental impact report to determine whether its Permit Exemption Determination 20

21 may cause a significant effect on the environment. PRC §§ 21080(a), 21080(c)-(f).

89.
22 The Air District unlawfully approved the exemption without first preparing an

23 initial study and considering the type of environmental document required by CEQA. 14

24 CCR §§ 15060, 15063. The Air District must analyze the potential environmental effects of

25 the Project and make certain findings as to the significance of those effects. PRC § 21080.

90.
26 The Permit Exemption Determination also improperly conflates required

27 mitigation measures into the Project without conducting any analysis of impacts in order to

28 require enforceable mitigation. In Lotus v. Dept. of Transportation (2013) 223 Cal.App.4th
22
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF
4108-029acp

650, the court held that "avoidance, minimization and/or mitigation measures," are not "part

2 of the project." Id. at 656. Rather, they are mitigation measures designed to reduce or

3 eliminate environmental impacts of the project, and must be treated as such.

4 91. The Air District's conditions of approval in the Permit Exemption

5 Determination, such as the requirement that the total flaring capacity not exceed 193 scf/hr,

6 or that the concentration of pollutions in the vent is not to exceed those described in the

7 Applicant's application, indicate that exempting fertilizer plant equipment from Air District

8 I permitting requirements is a discretionary action that requires mitigation.

9. 92. With respect to the flare, Petitioners provided substantial evidence based on

10 expert opinion, pursuant to CEQA Guidelines, section 15064(f)(5), that the flare did not

11 qualify as a Low Emitting Unit and required an ATC. By exempting the flare from permitting
12 requirements, the Air District failed to satisfy its obligations under CEQA to determine if the

13 flare would contribute to the SKIC's significant and unavoidable air quality impacts, and to

14 require feasible mitigation measures or Project alternatives. 14 CCR 15096(g). The Air
15 District's failure to identify required mitigation measures, performn any independent analysis

16 of the Project's potential effects, or to make the required findings, is prejudicial abuse of

17 discretion in that the Air District failed to proceed in the manner required by law.

18 Unlawful Segmentation of the Project
19 93. The Air District violated CEQA by excluding the ammonia loop purge vent,

20 ammonia plant stack vent, acid gas removal system/C02 vent, and flare from the Project.

21 94. A public agency may not segment a large project into two or more smaller

22 projects in order to mask serious environmental consequences. CEQA prohibits such a

23 "piecemeal" approach and requires review of a project's impacts as a whole. 14 CCR

24 15378(a); Burbank- Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority V. Hensler (1991) 233 Cal.App.3d
25 577, 592. CEQA mandates "that environmental considerations do not become submerged by

26 chopping a large project into many little ones - each with a minimal potential impact on the

27

28 23
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF
4108-029acp

environment - which cumulatively may have disastrous consequences." Bozung v. Local

2 Agency Formation Commission (1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 283-84.

3 95. The ATC and NOD do not mention the ammonia loop purge vent, ammonia

4 plant stack vent, acid gas removal system/CO2 vent, or flare, which are components of the

5 Project addressed by the separate Permit Exemption Determination. The Air District abused

6 its discretion and failed to comply with CEQA when it "submerged" environmental impacts

7 by chopping up Project components into separate Air District decisions each with lesser

8 impacts on the environment which together may have significant impacts. As a result, the

9 Air District unlawfully piecemealed the Project.

10 96. The Air District's issuance of the NOD for the ATC constitutes a prejudicial

11 abuse of discretion in that the District failed to proceed in the manner required by law.

12 Failure to Include the Whole of an Action in the NOD

13 97. The Air District violated CEQA by failing to analyze the whole Project,

14 including the ASU and pipeline.

15 98. Under CEQA "project" means "the whole of an action, which has a potential

16 for resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably

17 foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment." 14 CCR § 15378. "The term

18 'project' refers to the activity which is being approved and which may be subject to several
19 discretionary approvals by governmental agencies. The term 'project' does not mean each

20 separate governmental approval." Id. An EIR must treat activities as part of the project if

21 they are "a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the initial project and the future expansion

22 or action will be significant in that it will likely change the scope or nature of the initial

23 project or its environmental effects." Laurel Heights Improvement Association v. Regents of

1 100. The Air District abused its discretion and failed to comply with CEQA when

2 did not consider the pipeline and ASU as part of the "whole of an action" in approving the
3 Project.

4 Failure to Mail the NOD

5 101. The Air District failed to mail the NOD to Petitioners within five working

6 days as required under Public Resources Code, section 21092.2. The November 22, 2017

7 NOD included a cover letter to the County Clerk/Recorder of Kern County that stated that
8 the Air District "is filing the enclosed Notice of Determination for the project pursuant to
9 CEQA § 21152(a), and CEQA Guidelines, § 15096(i)."

10 102. Section 21092.2 requires public agencies to mail notices pursuant to Public
11 Resources Code, sections 21080.4, 21083.9, 21092, 21108, 21152, and 21161 to every

12 person who has filed a written request for notices with either the clerk of the governing body

13 or, if there is no governing body, the director of the agency.

14 103. Petitioners submitted a request for mailed notices, pursuant to Public

15 Resources Code, section 21092.2., on July 20, 2016. Petitioners' request was mailed and
16 emailed to the Mr. Sadredin, the Executive Director, and Ms. Franco, the Clerk of the Board.

17 However, despite making a determination pursuant to Public Resources Code, section 21152,
18 the Petitioners did not receive the NOD in the mail.

19 104. Petitioners also requested notice through the Air District's online portal. The

20 Air District has been sending notices to Petitioners since February 24, 2016 and as recently
21 as December 1, 2017.

22 105. Respondents abused their discretion and proceeded in a manner contrary to

23 law by failing to mail the NOD.

24 Failure to Make Record Available

25 106. CEQA Guidelines, section 15091 states a that a "public agency shall specify the

26 location and custodian of the documents or other material which constitute the record of
27 proceedings upon which its decision based.' The NOD indicated that the Air District's

28 25
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF 4108-029acp

1 "record of project approval" is available to the "General Public." The Air District failed to

2 comply with its NOD and CEQA Guidelines when it failed to make the record available to

3 Petitioners.

4 107. On November 28, 2017, the Air District's Public Records Request

5 Coordinator, Noemi Calderon, responded to Petitioners' request for records, explaining that

6 the Air District would provide documents responsive to Petitioners' November 17, 2017 and

7 November 27, 2017 Public Records Requests no later than December 21, 2017. The email

8 from Ms. Calderon stated: "Your Public Records Requests of 11/17/17 and 11/27/17 seck

9 documents that are both exempt and non-exempt from public disclosure. This requires that

10 the District gather the documents, review them, and prepare any necessary redactions. The

11 District will provide you with documents responsive to both requests no later than December

12 21, 2017, and can do so electronically. Accordingly, it is not necessary for you to send a

13 copy service to the District office tomorrow, as the records will not be ready for disclosure.

14 We will provide you with the documents as soon as possible."

15 108. Therefore, the Air District abused its discretion and proceeded in a manner

16 contrary to law by failing to have the record of proceedings upon which its decision is based

17 available for public review. Respondents must set aside the NOD, ATC, and Permit

18 Exemption Determination until the Respondents have complied with CEQA.

19 Failure to Make Findings, Adopt Statement of Overriding Considerations, Apply

20 Feasible Mitigation Measures or Feasible Alternatives

21 109. The Air District did not make available with the "record of project approval" or

22 the "record of proceedings" described in the NOD.

23 110. On information and belief, the Air District has no record that the APCO made

24 findings, adopted a statement of overriding considerations, or determined whether feasible

25 mitigation measures or feasible alternatives within the Air District's powers are available that

26 would substantially lessen or avoid any significant effect.

111.A Responsible Agency under CEQA is required to independently consider the

2 Lead Agency's EIR, and adopt its own independent CEQA findings and statement of
3 overriding considerations. 14 CCR §§ 15096(a) and (h), 15091, 15093.

4 112. With respect to findings, no Responsible Agency can approve or carry out a
project for which an EIR has been certified which identifies one or more significant

6 environmental effects of the project unless the public agency makes one or more written

7 findings for each of those significant effects, accompanied by a brief explanation of the

8 rationale for each finding. The possible findings are:

9 (1) Changes or alterations have been required in, or incorporated into, the
10 project which avoid or substantially lessen the significant
11 environmental effect as identified in the final EIR.

12 (2) Such changes or alterations are within the responsibility and
13 jurisdiction of another public agency and not the agency making the
14 finding. Such changes have been adopted by such other agency or can
15 and should be adopted by such other agency.

16 (3) Specific economic, legal, social, technological, or other considerations,
17 including provision of employment opportunities for highly trained
18 workers, make infeasible the mitigation measures or project
19 alternatives identified in the final EIR.

20 14 CCR §15091(a).

21 113. Additionally, the finding in subdivision (a)(3), supra, must describe the
22 specific reasons for rejecting identified mitigation measures and project alternatives. 14 CCR

23 coa 15091(c). When making the findings required in subdivision (a)(1), supra, the agency shall
24 also adopt a program for reporting on or monitoring the changes which it has either required
25 in the project or made a condition of approval to avoid or substantially lessen significant
26 environmental effects. 14 CCR § 15091(d). These measures must be fully enforceable
27 through permit conditions, agreements, or other measures. Id.

1 114. CEQA requires Respondents to make findings required by 14 CCR § 15091

2 for each significant effect of the project and shall make findings in 14 CCR § 15093 if

3 necessary. 14 § CCR § 15096(h).

4 115. A statement of overriding considerations made pursuant to 14 CCR § 15093 §

5 does not substitute for the findings required by 14 CCR § 15091. 14 CCR §§ 15091(f),

6 15093(c).

7 116. A Responsible Agency under CEQA is required to adopt its own statement of

8 overriding considerations. 14 CCR §§ 15096(h). "CEQA requires the decision-making

9 agency to balance, as applicable, the economic, legal, social, technological, or other benefits,

10 including region-wide or statewide environmental benefits, of a proposed project against its

11 unavoidable environmental risks when determining whether to approve the project." 14 CCR

12 cpp 15093(a). "If the specific economic, legal, social, technological, or other benefits, including

13 region-wide or statewide environmental benefits, of a proposed project outweigh the

14 unavoidable adverse environmental effects, the adverse environmental effects may be

15 considered 'acceptable.'" 14 CCR § 15093(a).

16 117. "When the lead agency approves a project which will result in the occurrence

17 of significant effects which are identified in the final EIR but are not avoided or substantially

18 lessened, the agency shall state in writing the specific reasons to support its action based on

19 the final EIR and/or other information in the record. The statement of overriding

20 considerations shall be supported by substantial evidence in the record." 14 CCR 15093(b).

21 118. The Responsible Agency shall not approve the project as proposed if the

22 agency finds any feasible alternative or feasible mitigation measures within its powers that

23 would substantially lessen or avoid any significant effect the project would have on the
24 environment. 14 CCR § 15096(g)(2), PRC § 21081. A Responsible Agency has

1 119. According to section 3.2.3 of the Air District's Environmental Review

2 Guidelines: Procedures for Implementing the California Environmental Quality Act (August
3 2000), the decision-making body may not delegate the following functions, in accordance

4 with CEQA Guidelines, section 15025(b): "reviewing and considering a final EIR or
5 approving a Negative Declaration prior to approving a project and making of findings

6 required by [CEQA Guidelines sections] 15091 and 15093. These findings relate to

7 mitigation of significant impacts and to statements of overriding consideration when impacts

8 cannot be mitigated but the project will be approved." On information and belief, the Air

9 District abused its discretion and failed to comply with CEQA when it failed to determine
10 whether feasible mitigation measures or feasible alternatives within the Air District's powers
11 would substantially lessen or avoid any significant effect the Project would have on the

12 environment, as necessary.

13 120. On information and belief, the Project Approvals require findings and a
14 statement of overriding considerations, pursuant to CEQA Guidelines, sections 15091 and
15 15093, respectively.

16 121. On information and belief, the Air District abused its discretion and failed to

17 comply with CEQA when it failed to carry out its duty as a Responsible Agency to make
18 findings and adopt a statement of overriding considerations.
19 122. On information and belief, the Air District abused its discretion and failed to

20 comply with CEQA when the Governing Board failed to carry out its duty as a decision-
21 making body of the Responsible Agency to make findings and adopt a statement of
22 overriding considerations.

23 123. On information and belief, the Air District's decision-making body for the
24 Project Approvals, is required to make one or more written findings for each significant.
25 impact, accompanied by a brief explanation of the rationale for each finding. The Air
26 District's possible findings are: changes or alternatives have been required in, or incorporated
27 into, the project which avoid or substantially lessen the significant environmental effect as
28 29
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR

identified in the final EIR. Such changes or alterations are within the responsibility and

2 jurisdiction of another public agency and not the agency making the finding. Such changes

3 have been adopted by such other agency or can and should be adopted by such other agency.

4 And, specific economic, legal, social, technological, or other considerations, including

5 provision of employment opportunities for highly trained workers, make infeasible the

6 mitigation measures or project alternatives identified in the final EIR. The Air District is

7 required to support its findings with substantial evidence in the record. 14 CCR § 15091.

8 124. On information and belief, the Air District's decision-making body for the

9 Project Approvals is required to adopt a statement of overriding considerations if the Air

10 District determines that the Project will result in the occurrence of significant effects which

11 are identified in the final EIR but are not avoided or substantially lessened. The Air District

12 is required to supports its statement of overriding considerations with substantial evidence in

13 the record. 14 CCR $ 15093. §

14 125. In the alternative, on information and belief, the Air District abused its

15 discretion and failed to comply with CEQA when the APCO, Mr. Sadredin, failed to carry

16 out his duty as the decision-making body of the Responsible Agency to make findings and

17 adopt a statement of overriding considerations.

18 Alternatively, Failure to Support its Findings and Statement of Overriding with

19 Substantial Evidence

22 127. CEQA requires that the findings be supported by substantial evidence in the

23 record. 14 CCR § 15091(b). §

24 128. The Air District abused their discretion, and violated CEQA, in failing to

25 support its findings, if any, with substantial evidence for each significant environmental

26 effect of the Project. 14 CCR § 15091, 15096(h).

4 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

5 Violations of Health and Safety Code

6 (H&S Code con 39000 et seq:)

7 130. Petitioners' re-allege and incorporate all of the above paragraphs as if fully set

8 forth herein.

131. Respondents were at all times under a mandatory duty to comply with all

10 requirements of the Health and Safety Code and Air District rules and regulations.

11 Respondents failed and refused to perform that duty.

12 132. Respondents failed to comply with the requirements of the H&S Code and Air

13 District rules by exempting the flare from permitting requirements as a LEU and not
14 requiring an ATC for the flare.

15 133. H&S Code section 40001 requires air pollution control districts to "adopt and
16 enforce rules and regulations to achieve and maintain the state and federal ambient air quality

17 standards in all areas affected by emission sources under their jurisdiction." H&S Code, §

18 40001. The Hearing Board will hear challenges to the Air District's decision to issue a permit
19 and will determine if the permit was "properly issued." H&S Code, § 42302.1.

20 134. Pursuant to the H&S Code, the Air District adopted its own rules and

21 regulations, including Air District Rules 2020 and 2201, to implement its air quality
22 attainment plan.

23 135. Under Rule 2020, an emissions unit is exempt from permitting requirements
24 as an LEU if its uncontrolled emissions rate of each air contaminant is below 2 lb/day and, if

25 greater than 2 lb/day, then less than or equal to 75 lb/yr. Rule 2020, §§ 3.10, 6.19.

26

27

28 Unless specifically noted, all rules refer to the Air District's adopted rules and regulations.
31
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF 4108-029acp

1 136. Rule 2020 and Rule 2201 define "emissions unit" as "an identifiable operation

2 or piece of process equipment such as a source operation which emits, may emit, or results in

3 the emissions of any affected pollutant directly or as fugitive emissions." Rule 2020, § 3.4;

4 Rule 2201, § 3.17 (emphasis added).

5 137. An emissions unit's potential emissions (i.e., the emissions it may emit)

6 inform the Air District if the unit may be exempt from permitting requirements. See
7 Application Review, pdf pp. 11-13, Order pp. 5-6 ("the flare therefore meets the definition of

8 a Low Emitting Unit because the daily potential emissions for each pollutant are less than 2

9 pounds per day." [emphasis added]).

10 138. An emissions unit's potential to emit is the maximum amount the unit can

11 emit under its physical and operational design, unless there is a physical or operational

12 limitation or an enforceable permit condition that limits how much the unit can emit. See

13 Rule 2201, § 3.27 (defining potential to emit); see also, e.g., Eastern Kern Air Pollution

14 Control District, Rule 202 (exempting sources if the potential to emit any uncontrolled

15 affected pollutant is less than or equal to 2 pounds per day); Sacramento Metropolitan Air

16 Quality Management District Rule 122 (exempting equipment if it would emit less than two

17 pounds per day of any pollutants without the benefit of air pollution control devices).

18 139. Therefore, the Air District must include emergency flaring emissions in the

19 flare's potential emissions unless the emergency flaring emissions are limited by the flare's

20 physical or operational design or by enforceable permit conditions.

21 140. The fertilizer plant flare's design does not limit emergency flaring emissions

22 to below the LEU threshold. Indeed, the Air District's own numbers demonstrate that if there

23 IS one 20-minute flaring event per year, then the flare exceeds LEU thresholds. Additionally,

24 the fertilizer plant flare has no permit; therefore, no enforceable permit conditions exist

25 which would limit its emissions to below LEU thresholds. Rather, the fertilizer plant flare's

26 potential emissions exceed the thresholds set forth in the Air District's own rules and

27 regulations, and the Air District was therefore required to issue an ATC for the flare.

28 32
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF
4108-029acp

141. The Air District's arbitrary and capricious decision to exempt the flare from

2 permitting requirements as a LEU and not require an ATC is an abuse of discretion and a

3 failure to proceed in a manner required by the law. H&S Code, §§ 40001, 40600; Rule 2020,

4 2201.

5 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

6 Violations of Government Code

7 (Govt. Code § 6250 et seq.)

8 142. Petitioners' re-allege and incorporate all of the above paragraphs as if fully set
9 forth herein.

10 143. Respondents were at all times under a mandatory duty to comply with all
11 requirements of the Public Records Act, Government Code sections 6250 et seq.
12 Respondents failed and refused to perform that duty.

13 144. Respondents failed to comply with the requirements of the Public Records Act
14 by withholding emissions data from public disclosure.

15 145. The Public Records Act requires agencies to make non-exempt public records
16 available to the public for inspection and/or copying upon request. Govt. Code §
17 6253(a) (c).

18 145. The Public Records Act exempts from disclosure certain records, including
19 for example, records that are trade secrets. Govt. Code § 6254.7(d). Air pollution emissions
20 data, including emissions data which constitute trade secrets, however, are public records and
21 cannot be exempt from public disclosure. Govt. Code § 6254.7(e).

22 146. The Air District withheld from public disclosure portions of records
23 containing emissions data and, therefore, failed to proceed in a manner required by law.

24 Govt. Code §§ 6253, 6254.7(e).

25 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code ("PRC") section 21000, et seq. and Title 14, California Code of Regulations ("CCR"), § 15000 et seq. (collectively, "CEQA"), in Kern County Superior Court challenging the unlawful November 22, 2017 Notice of Determination (State Clearinghouse Number: 1991122017) for Calamco NH3, LLC's project N-1163737 ("NOD"), approval of Calamco NH3, LLC's Authority to Construct (S-8943-1-0) for project N-1163737 ("ATC") and issuance of the November 21, 2017 letter to Kelly Merritt, 1 Calamco NH3 LLC, regarding Permit Exemption Determination for Certain Low Emitting Units at Ammonia Manufacturing Facility (S-8943) Project: 8-11637372 ("Permit Exemption Letter") and all related approvals (collectively, "Project") by San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District, its Hearing Board, its Governing Board, its Executive Director/Air Pollution Control Officer, Seyed Sadredin, its Director of Permit Services, Arnaud Marjollet, its Permit Services Manager, Leonard Scandura, and its Program Manager, Brian Clements, (collectively, "Air District" or "Respondents"),
The NOD describes the Project as installing a 7.9 MW electric power generation system (combined cycle configuration) consisting of a natural gas-fired gas turbine engine with heat recovery steam generator with 151 MMBtu/hr waste fuel-fired duct burner and 1.39 MMBtu/hr pilot, selective catalytic reduction ("SCR") and carbon monoxide ("CO") catalysts. According to the NOD, the electric power generation system is proposed to provide electrical power and steam to its anhydrous ammonia manufacturing equipment located at the same site at the South Kern Industrial Center in Kern County,
The ATC is for a 7.9 MW electric power generation system (combined cycle configuration), consisting of a 85.9 MMBtu/hr natural gas-fired solar Taurus model 70 gas turbine engine (or equivalent) with dry low nitrogen oxides ("NOx") combustors, CO catalyst, heat recovery steam generator with 151 MMBtu/hr waste gas-fired pilot/purge burner served by the SCR system and CO catalyst.
The Permit Exemption Letter exempts the ammonia loop purge vent, ammonia plant stack vent, acid gas removal system/CO2 vent, and flare from the Project's ATC permit (S-8943-1-0),

1 On information and belief Kelly Merritt is the eame individual as James Merritt who is identified as the Project Applicant on the CEQA Transmittal Memorandum Gled an Nov. 22, 2017 in addition to the NOD.
On information and belief, S-1163737 is the same project as N-1163737. 3540-0G0ncp

Our clients may be willing to forego this lawsuit if the Air District promptly contacts us to set forth its plan for tolling any alleged statute of limitations, and rescinding its NOD, ATC and Permit Exemption Letter until a legally adequate permit and CEQA document is prepared and circulated for public review, or proposing alternative, potential terms of settlement acceptable to our clients.

Re: Notice to Attorney General of Verified First Amended Petition and Complaint for Violations of CEQA, H&S Code, and Govt. Code
Calamco NH3, LLC Project

Dear Mr. Becerra:

This letter is provided to you in accordance with notice under Public Resources Code § 21167.7 and Code § of Civil Procedure § 388, that on December 21, 2017, Kern County Citizens for Responsible Development ("Citizens"), David Carnahan, Justin Callison and California Unions for Reliable Energy (collectively "Petitioners") filed a Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief ("Petition and Complaint") against Respondents and Defendants San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District; its Governing Board; its Hearing Board; its Executive Director/Air Pollution Control

CALAMCO NH3, LLC filed a name change to Taft Ammonia Company, LLC on November 17, 2017 in the state of Delaware.

On March 30, 2018, Petitioners amended the Petition and Complaint. In the Verified First Amended Petition and Complaint, Petitioners challenge: the Air District's November 21, 2017 approval of Authority to Construct (S-8943-1-0) ("ATC") for the Applicant's anhydrous ammonia manufacturing facility and cogeneration power plant, No. N-1163737 ("Project"); the Air District's November 21, 2017 Permit Exemption Determination, exempting the ammonia loop purge vent, ammonia plant stack vent, acid gas removal system/CO2 vent, and flare components of the Project from permitting ("Permit Exemption Determination"); the Air District's November 22, 2017 Notice of Determination, SCH No. 1991122017
("NOD"); the Air District's February 28, 2018 decision to deny Petitioners' appeal to the Hearing Board and to uphold the Air District's approvals of the ATC and Permit Exemption Determination; and the Air District's decision to withhold emissions
data from public disclosure.

Respondents' approval of the ATC, issuance of the Permit Exemption Determination, and issuance and filing of the NOD (collectively, "Project Approvals") constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failure to proceed in a manner required by law, in violation of the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code ("PRC") section 21000, et seq., California Environmental Quality Act Guidelines, Title 14, California Code of Regulations ("CCR"), § 15000 et seq. (collectively, "CEQA), California Health and Safety Code ("H&S Code") section 39000, et seq. and the Air District's rules and regulations.

The Verified First Amended Petition and Complaint alleges that Respondents
abused their discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law, in
violation of CEQA by (1) failing to provide notice of the Permit Exemption
Determination, (2) by failing to provide environmental analysis or findings for the Permit Exemption Determination, (3) by unlawfully segmenting the Project, (4) by failing to include the "whole of an action" in the NOD, (5) by failing to mail the NOD, (6) by failing to make the record available, (7) by failing to make findings, adopt a statement of overriding considerations, apply feasible mitigation measures or feasible alternatives; (8) and, in the alternative, failing to support its findings and statement of overriding consideration with substantial evidence.
The Verified First Amended Petition and Complaint also alleges that Respondents violated the H&S Code and Air District's rules and regulations when it exempted the Project's flare from permitting requirements and failed to issue an ATC for the flare. The Air District also violated the California Public Records Act,
