FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT.

Introduction

2 1. This action seeks to correct the ultra vires actions the City of Los Angeles ("City") took

3 in settling Sunset Ranch Hollywood Stables, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, et al. (LASC Case No.

4 BC576506). That settlement did the following:

5 Permanently closed pedestrian access to a public trailhead (the Hollyridge Trail) at a
public park (Griffith Park);
6

7 Channeled massive amounts of vehicular and pedestrian traffic to another neighborhood
and another section of the park;

8

=50 Transferred the use of a new gate and secured-entry system, a public resource paid for
with taxpayer funds, to Sunset Ranch, a private party.
Purported to transfer the public's rights of way to a private party, Sunset Ranch.

12 Effectively gave Sunset Ranch a Conditional Use Permit, a variance, a or a license, to
operate exclusively on publicly owned land, to the detriment of public access, and

13
2. exempted Sunset Ranch from a variety of municipal ordinances.

14 Municipal officials cannot by settlement take actions in excess of their authority or ones

15 that violate state law or municipal ordinances. Thus, this settlement was ultra vires or outright

16 unlawful, for the following reasons:

17 It purported to make a legislative, administrative, or regulatory decision about Griffith

18 Park access points. Such decisions can only be made by a majority vote by the Los

19 Angeles Recreation and Park Commission and/or the Los Angeles City Council, in a
noticed, public hearing.

20 The settlement abrogated the Hollywoodland Specific Plan and a Historic-Cultural

21 designation and contravened other municipal zoning provisions and designations, which

22 cannot be done without noticed, public hearings.

23 It gifted-public funds and public resources to a private party.

24 It violated several Los Angeles Municipal Code zoning provisions for the issuance of

25. variances, conditional-use permits, and licenses.

26 The City Attorney acted in excess of his authority.

27 The stipulation, by taking legislative actions that require public meetings - but then

28 3. making such decisions in private - violated open-meeting laws.
Petitioners bring this public-interest suit, to preserve public access to Griffith Park, to
represent the interests of taxpayers, to protect the environment, and to vindicate the public's open-

-1-
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

meeting rights.

2 Parties

4.
3 Petitioner and Plaintiff Friends of Griffith Park ("Friends") is a California non-profit
corporation dedicated to preserving and protecting Griffith Park's natural habitat, biodiversity, and
4 historic features, for current and future generations. Friends is committed to ensuring that Griffith Park
5 remains open, natural, and free to all citizens of Los Angeles. In addition to conducting graffiti
6 removals and cleanups of the Park, Friends has funded surveys of the Park's unique biological
7 resources, spearheaded efforts to restore Fern Dell, and is currently planning an enhancement of a

8 segment of the Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail that runs through the Griffith Park. The

9 decision to end pedestrian access to Griffith Park from Beachwood Canyon strikes at the heart of

10 Friends' principles for open access. In addition to its longstanding mission of protecting Griffith Park,

11 many of Friend's members reside in and pay property taxes within Los Angeles, and have an interest in

12 ensuring open, accountable, responsive government and in protecting the region's environment and the
public's environmental and other quality-of-life amenities. Additionally, Friends' members regularly
13 used the now-closed Beachwood Canyon entrance to Griffith Park to hike to the Hollywood Sign and to
14 hike in Griffith Park, and now cannot do so. Friends is suing on its own behalf and for the benefit of
15 itself and its members, all persons similarly situated, and taxpayers within the jurisdiction of Los
16 Angeles.

17 5. Petitioner and Plaintiff Griffith J. Griffith Charitable Trust ("Griffith Trust") a is a private

18 family trust established to administer the estate and the heir's interests in the estate of Colonel Griffith

19 J. Griffith, who donated the land for and is the namesake of Griffith Park. Griffith Trust has

20 reversionary rights to Griffith Park if the City violates the terms of the original grant, which requires
that Griffith Park be used as a public park. Public access to the park is a part of its core mission. When
21 the park expanded to the west, the trustees fought to ensure public access from Western Avenue. The
22 Griffith Trust famously objected when the City attempted to institute a fee for driving automobiles into
23 the park. Today, it is supporting a much more basic issue: the right of pedestrians to access one of the
24 park's trailheads, which gives hikers access to the park's entire network of trails. Griffith Trust is suing

25 on its own behalf and for the benefit of itself and its members, all persons similarly situated, and

26 taxpayers within the jurisdiction of Los Angeles.

27 6. Petitioner and Plaintiff Los Feliz Oaks Homeowners Association ("Oaks" or collectively

28 with Friends and Griffith Park Trust as "Petitioners") is California non-profit corporation which
represents homeowners adjacent to Griffith Park. Oaks' members reside in and pay real-property taxes

-2-
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

within Los Angeles and have an interest in ensuring open, accountable, responsive government and in

2 protecting the region's environment and the public's quality-of-life amenities. As a result of the

3 closure of the Beachwood Canyon entrance to Griffith Park, the City has redirected traffic through
Oaks' jurisdiction, severely affecting the area. Oaks is suing on its own behalf and for the benefit .of
4 itself and its members, all persons similarly situated, and taxpayers within the jurisdiction of Los
5 Angeles.

6 7. Respondent and Defendant City of Los Angeles ("City" or "Respondent") is a charter
7 city organized under California law and located within Los Angeles County. The City owns Griffith

8 Park, located at 4730 Crystal Springs Drive in Los Angeles.

9 8. The true names of and capacities of Respondents and Defendants Does 1-10 inclusive

10 are unknown to plaintiffs at this time. Petitioners sue these defendants by fictitious names. Petitioners

11 will seek leave to amend this complaint to insert the true names and capacities of the fictitiously named
defendants when plaintiffs ascertain that information: Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon
12 allege that each of defendants designated as Doe herein is responsible in some manner for the acts,
13 occurrences, omissions, and liabilities herein charged.
14 9. Real Party in Interest Sunset Ranch Hollywood Stables, Inc. ("Sunset Ranch") is a
15 Nevada corporation doing business in the city of Los Angeles. Plaintiffs believe that in its absence,
16 complete relief cannot be accorded. Further, Sunset Ranch claims an interest relating to the subject of

17 the action; the disposition of the action in its absence may impair or impede its ability to protect that

18 interest.

10.
19 The true names of and capacities of Real Parties in Interest Roes 1-10 inclusive are

20 unknown to plaintiffs at this time. Petitioners sue these defendants by fictitious names. Petitioners will
seek leave to amend this complaint to insert the true names and capacities of the fictitiously named
21 defendants when plaintiffs ascertain that information. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon
22 allege that each of defendants designated as Roe herein is responsible in some manner for the acts,
23 occurrences, omissions, and liabilities herein charged.

24 Jurisdiction, Venue, and Exhaustion of Remedies

25 11. Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1094.5 and 1085, and

26 Government Code sections 549560 and 549560.1, this Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandate

27 to set aside Respondent's actions.
12.
28 Venue is proper in this Court because Griffith Park lies entirely within Los Angeles
County and the environmental impacts of the closure of pedestrian access through Beachwood Canyon

-3-
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

will be acutely felt in this county. The causes of action in this Petition, or some part of those causes,
arise in this
2 county. Venue is also proper in this Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections

3 394 (actions against a city, county or local agency), and 395 (actions generally), since the City of Los
Angeles is in the County of Los Angeles.
4 13. Petitioners were not required to exhaust administrative remedies prior to filing this
5. action. Alternatively, petitioners have exhausted all applicable administrative remedies prior to filing

6 this action. Alternatively, exhausting administrative remedies would be futile.

7 14. There is no adequate remedy other than the relief requested, for righting the wrongs

8 detailed in this complaint.

9 Factual Background

10 15. Griffith Park was created in 1896, when Colonel Griffith J. Griffith and his wife Mary

11 Agnes Christine donated 3,000 acres to the City of Los Angeles, "to be used as a public park for
purposes of recreation, health, and pleasure, for the use and benefit of inhabitants of the said City of
12 Los Angeles, forever." In his original gift of 3,015 acres to the City on 16 December 1896, Griffith J.
13 Griffith showed concern that his park should remain freely accessible to everyone. Over time,
14 additional grants of land became part of Griffith Park, and all of those grants were accepted by the City
15 as part of Griffith Park and tied together with Griffith Park by law, deed, or prescription.

16 16. Griffith Park is the largest municipal park with urban wilderness in the United States and

17. includes a number of notable landmarks, including the world famous Hollywood Sign, the Los Angeles

18 Zoo, and the Greek Theatre.
17.
19 In 2009, the City designated Griffith Park as Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument

20 No. 942, protecting the Park under state and local historic-protection laws. The designation specifically
includes the Beachwood Canyon entrance to Griffith Park as a historically significant feature,
21 describing it as the beginning of the iconic Hollyridge Trail.
22 18. The Beachwood Canyon gate, formerly a single-swing style gate, has for most of the
23 Park's history served as an access point for pedestrians and vehicles into the Park.
24 19. Sunset Ranch, a business offering horse rides and lodging holds an access easement for

25 its customers, boarders, and employees on the paved road accessed through the Beachwood Canyon

26 Gate.

27 20. Until the City closed the Beachwood Canyon Gate on 18 April 2017 (except during the

28 construction period), pedestrians have always been able to enter Griffith Park and the Sunset Ranch
Stables via the paved road at the end of Beachwood Canyon. It is furthermore undisputed that the

-4-
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

public used this route and the various paths thereon before 1972, so an implied dedication may have

2 occurred, with the public further acquiring prescriptive rights over relevant stretches.'
21.
3 In 2001, the City improved pedestrian access from the Beachwood Canyon Gate,
building an access trail connecting the Hollyridge Trail directly to the paved road leading into Griffith
4 Park and Sunset Ranch.
5 22. 5 On 5 March 2014, the City's Recreation and Parks Board (Board") voted to improve
6 the Beachwood Canyon Gate by removing the existing single-swing gate and installing new fencing,
7 gates, and sidewalks. This action included installation of a brand-new, 4-feet-wide by 8-feet-high,

8 tubular-steel single pedestrian gate, and an 8-feet-high by 23-feet-wide, tubular-steel vehicular gate,

9 and a secured-access system, all paid for using taxpayer funds.

10 23. The new Beachwood Canyon Gate was reopened for hikers and pedestrians in January

11 of 2015 and allowed public access, as well as vehicular access for customers, vendors, boarders, and
employees of Sunset Ranch.
12 24. The City is enmeshed in litigation with Sunset Ranch over its easement through the
13 Beachwood Canyon Gate. See Sunset Ranch Hollywood Stables, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, et al.
14 (LASC Case No. BC576506). In that case, Sunset Ranch sought injunctive relief and seeks monetary
15 damages against the city for pedestrians burdening parts of its easement.

16 25. After bench trial, the court ruled that the right-of-way agreement did not give Sunset

17 Ranch exclusive use of the easement, but the court found that the City had unreasonably and unduly

18 interfered with it. The court granted in part Sunset Ranch's request for an injunction, ruling that "[t]he

19 City of Los Angeles is preliminarily enjoined and ordered to provide public pedestrian access to the

20 Hollyridge Trail, at a location as closest [sie] to the start of the subject easement (i.e., the location

21 of the Beachwood gate, ...) or at the pre-2001 access point (from Hollyridge Drive), as is
practicable." (emphasis added).
22 26. After failing to prevail at this phase of the trial, the City rushed to settle the case. It and
23 Sunset Ranch filed a document entitled, "Joint Stipulation for Order Re Request and Compliance with
24 Court Ruling" (Stipulation). In the Stipulation, instead of providing the public access to the Hollyridge

25 Trail as close as possible to the easement (which the court had ordered, and which could have easily

26 been done), the parties agreed to close all pedestrian access through the Beachwood Canyon gate

27 permanently, and to channel traffic through another neighborhood.
27.
28 The Stipulation contained a long list of demonstrable falsehoods and omissions,
including false statements about the closest access point and its distance from the Beachwood Gate,

-5-
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

misstatements and mischaracterizations about previous municipal actions regarding the gate,

2 misleading statements about the capacity and impacts at the next available access point, and a variety of
other troubling errors and omissions.
28. After becoming aware of this collusive and misleading stipulation, the Petitioners here
4 sought to intervene in the existing proceeding. At oral argument, the Honorable Elizabeth Feffer
5 several times expressed dismay at the above seriousness of the facts and allegations. However, she
6 suggested the Petitioners file this mandamus action instead of being granted the right to intervene, since

7 their presence could delay the upcoming damages phase in the existing case.

8 29. Sunset Ranch now posts a guard at the Beachwood Gate, just like the city used to -- and

9 controls and operates the physical gate infrastructure, which was paid for by public funds. It turns

10 away certain cars, just like the city used to. It causes the rest to queue up for long periods on a public a

11 street, in violation of traffic laws. It allows its guests to stay in the park after park closing hours, and

12 then to exit the park in violation of city law. Municipal law does not allow these actions, and it is
therefore clear the City has contracted away its police powers, improperly exempting Sunset Ranch
13 from the law.
14 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
15 (Violation of the City Charter)
16 (California Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085 or 1094.5)

17 30. Petitioners reallege and incorporate all of the above paragraphs as if fully set forth

18 herein.

31.
19 Los Angeles City Charter section 591(a) exclusively grants the City's Board of

20 Recreation and Park Commissioners the power "to control all recreation and park sites."
32.
21 Charter section 594(c) states that "All lands heretofore or hereafter set apart or dedicated
as a public park shall forever remain for the use of the public inviolate."
22 33. Griffith Park and the Beachwood Canyon Gate are recreation and park sites.
23 34. The City's closure of pedestrian access to Griffith Park through the Beachwood Canyon
24 Gate is inconsistent with the Board's March 5, 2014, decision to improve the Beachwood Canyon Gate

25 with a 4-feet-wide by 8-feet-high, tubular steel single pedestrian gate, and is inconsistent with prior

26 actions of the Board.

27 35. Any action to determine access points to Griffith Park is legislative in character and

28 requires action by the Board in a noticed, public meeting- which did not occur here.
36. Moreover, the park land on which the Beachwood entrance is located was previously set

-6-
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- apart and dedicated to the public, for public use. The City's action violates section 594(c) of the

2 Charter.

3 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

4 (Violations of the City General Plan, Hollywoodland Specific Plan, etc.)

5 37. (California Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085 or 1094.5)

6 herein. Petitioners reallege and incorporate all of the above paragraphs as if fully set forth

7 38.

8 The City's General Plan's Framework Element, Health & Wellness Element, Open

9 Space Element, Conservation Element, Hollywood Community Plan, Hollywoodland Specific Plan and
other portions apply to Griffith Park.

10 39. The Hollywoodland Specific Plan, Los Angeles City Ordinance No. 168,121, is a

11 governing land-use document adopted by the City to regulate land use and development decisions in

12 and around the Hollywoodland area in the City.
40.
13 The Hollywoodland Specific Plan (and hundreds of thousands of city-issued maps)

14 specifically depict Beachwood Canyon and the Hollyridge Trail as access points to Griffith Park, open
to the public.
15 41. The City's decision to close pedestrian access through the Beachwood Canyon Gate is
16 inconsistent with the Hollywoodland Specific Plan's designation of Hollywoodland as an access to

17 Griffith Park and is inconsistent with the city's General Plan.

18 42. Amending a plan requires the City to follow the process set forth in the Los Angeles

19 Municipal Code. It was not followed here.

20 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

21 (Violation of City's Historic Preservation Ordinances)

22 43. (California Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085 or 1094.5)

23 | herein. Petitioners reallegé and incorporate all of the above paragraphs as if fully set forth

24 44.

25 Section 22.171.14 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code requires that no Los Angeles

26 Historic-Cultural Monument will be substantially altered without approval and findings of fact from the
City's Cultural Heritage Commission.

27 45. Griffith Park is designated by the City as Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument No.

28 942 ("Historic Designation").

-7-
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

46. The Historic Designation specifically delineates pedestrian access through the

2 Beachwood Canyon Gate as an historic feature of Griffith Park.
47. Pedestrian access through the Beachwood Canyon Gate was closed without approval 3 from the City's Cultural Heritage Commission, in violation of the Los Angeles Municipal Code.
4 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
w (Gift of Public Funds; Violation of the California Constitution and Municipal Provisions
6 Prohibiting the Same)

7 (Cal. Code of Civil Procedure §§§ 526(a), 1085, or 1094.5)

8 48. Petitioners reallege and incorporate all of the above paragraphs as if fully set forth

9 herein.

49. 10 Article XVI, section 6 of the California Constitution, and other provisions in state and

11 local law prohibit the giving or lending of public funds.
50. Code of Civil Procedure section 526(a) allows any taxpayer to enforce these principles 12 in a representative capacity. Petitioners are doing so.
13 51. In permanently halting pedestrian access from Beachwood Canyon, the City has made a
14 gift of public funds to Sunset Ranch. The gate and the right of way now do not serve a public purpose
15 and provide no public benefit. Moreover, Sunset Ranch is actually operating the gate city property,

16 paid for by taxpayer funds - for its exclusive use and its exclusive benefit.

17 52. This was also an improper gift of Quimby Act funds under California Government Code

18 §66477 et seq. Such funds must be expended to serve the recreational needs of the residents within a

19 two-mile radius. The closure of a popular trailhead is the opposite of serving these recreational needs.
FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION
20 (Improper Transfer of Municipal Land, in Violation of the Los Angeles City Charter and
21 Administrative Code)
22 (Cal. Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085 or 1094.5)
23 53. Petitioners reallege and incorporate all -of the above paragraphs as if fully set forth
24 herein.

25 54. The Los Angeles City Charter prohibits the use of parkland for any purpose other than

26 public use. Los Angeles City Charter § 594(d) states that "[n]o sites under the management and control

27 of the department shall be devoted or transferred to any other purpose in whole or in part, except in

28 compliance with all of the following:" and then details a long list of criteria and procedures that were
not followed or even attempted here.

-8-
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

55. Los Angeles City Charter section 385 governs transfers of real property. Generally, such

2 transfers must be approved by the City Council.
56.
3 The Los Angeles Administrative Code sections 7.21 - 7.27, among others, list the
requirements that must be followed by the city when ceding control over even small pieces of
4 municipal property, also known as remnant properties. This includes obtaining an appraisal and
5 offering the property first to other city departments.
6 57. The City has ceded public rights of way and pieces of a public park, however small, to a
7 private entity. But the City did not follow any of the applicable legal requirements to do so.

8 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

9 (Violation of Los Angeles Municipal Code Provisions on Land Use and Park Use)

10 (Cal. Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085 or 1094.5)
58.
11 Petitioners reallege and incorporate all of the above paragraphs as if fully set forth
herein.
12 59. Zoning provisions exist to delineate the zones and uses permissible in and at designated
13 areas and sites within a city. Changing those zones and uses requires a process. Sections 12.24 and
14 12.27 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code and various other code provisions set forth the requirements
15 for the city granting conditional-use permits and variances.

16 60. Other municipal code provisions specify the procedures for allowing concessionaires

17 and licensees to operate on city land or to expand said operations.

18 61. The City's actions changed the use and effectively re-zoned the land in and around the

19 Beachwood Canyon Gate and Hollyridge trailhead from "parkland" to "commercial."
62.
20 Furthermore, allowing a private party to act as a gatekeeper, or to operate city equipment
(including a gate and security features) on city property is akin to a conditional use, a variance, or a
21 concession agreement.
22 63. Authorizing Sunset Ranch to change its business model and to exclude the public,
23 despite the public's long-established explicit and prescriptive rights, is also akin to a change in use or

24 variance, or a change to Sunset Ranch's license.

25 64. LAMC sections 63.44 B. 14(a) and K. 5 (and other sections) prohibit anyone from.

26 staying in a public park after designated hours or entering a public park with a parking lot through

27 prohibited entrances. By ceding authority and control to Sunset Ranch to except itself and its invitees

28 from these provisions, the City has issued an improper variance of binding laws.

-9-
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 65. The City did not follow any of the procedures set forth in the code that governs the

2 above actions.
SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION
3 (Violation of City Charter, Ultra Vires Acts by the City Attorney)
4 (Cal. Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085 or 1094.5)
5 66. Petitioners reallege and incorporate all of the above paragraphs as if fully set forth
6 herein.

7 67. Section 271 of the City Charter outlines the powers and duties of the City Attorney. It

8 does not grant him the powers exercised by the Stipulation.

9 68. Sections 272 and 273 of the City Charter set forth the principles governing settlements

10 of matters being litigated. Section 272(a) requires the approval of the full council as a client in matters, a

11 like here, involving land use. Section 273(c) states that the Council shall have the authority to settle
litigated matters only by a public vote, after the people of the city of Los Angeles have an opportunity 12 to make their voices heard.
13 69. The City's closure of pedestrian access to Griffith Park through Beachwood Canyon
14 exceeded the authority of the City Attorney and did not receive approval from the City Council.
15 70. In any event, the City Attorney has no authority to exempt the City or a private party

16 from state law or the municipal code, has no authority to make legislative determinations, and has no

17 authority to bypass public-meeting requirements.

18 71. Therefore, the City's actions were ultra vires, outside of the authority of the City

19 Attorney, inconsistent with the City Charter and state law.
EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION
20 (Violation of the Ralph M. Brown Act, California Government §§ 54950, et seq, and local open- 21 meeting rules)
22 (California Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085 or 1094.5)
23 72. Petitioners reallege and incorporate all of the above paragraphs as if fully set forth
24 herein.

25 73. The Ralph M. Brown Act, Cal. Government Code §§ 54950, et seq, requires noticed,

26 open meetings for most major legislative or quasi-legislative actions.

27 74. The City's closure of pedestrian access to Griffith Park from Beachwood Canyon, its

28 decisions to channel traffic to other access points, and its actions that affect land use, zoning, and
planning, were all legislative in character.

-10-

17.
11 Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and section 1085 and

12 of mandate to set aside Respondents' decision to certify the Project's environmental impact report and
13 purported approval of the Project.
14 18. Venue is proper in this Court because the Project lies entirely within the County of Los
15 Angeles and the environmental impacts of the Project will be acutely felt in this County. The cause

16 alleged in this Petition, or some part of that cause, arise in this county. (Code Civ. Proc. ("CCP") § 393;

17 Cal. State Parks Foundation v. Super. Ct. (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 826.) Venue is also proper in this

18 Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 394 (actions against a city, county or local agency)

19 and 395 (actions generally), since the City of Los Angeles is in the County of Los Angeles.
19.
20 The petition initiating this action was timely filed within 30 days after Respondent's
I decision to issue a Notice of Determination in accordance with Public Resources Code sections
21 21167(a).

26 more than ten days after the commencement of this proceeding, as required by Public Resources Code

27 Section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure Section 388. A true and correct copy of the notice is

28 attached to this pleading as Exhibit "B."

-4-
[PROPOSED] THIRD AMENDED VER PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

22. Petitioner has filed a request for hearing in compliance with PRC section 21167.4,

2 a true and correct copy of which request is attached hereto as Exhibit C.

3 23. Petitioners performed all conditions precedent to filing this instant action and exhausted

4 administrative remedies to the extent required by law under Public Resources Code section 21177.

5 Petitioners and/or other agencies and individuals raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in the
petition orally or in writing during the Respondents' decision-making process.
6 24. The violations by Respondents alleged herein have affected the beneficial interests of
7 Petitioners and/or their supporting members. The relief sought by way of this Petition will redress these
8 beneficial interests and the likelihood of future injury and interference with Petitioners' interests, and

9 those of their supporting members.

10 25. Petitioners have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy under ordinary law unless this

11 Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside the certification of the

12 Project and supporting environmental documents. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents'

13 decisions will remain in effect in violation of state law and injurious to Petitioners.
STATUTORY FRAMEWORK
14 California Environmental Quality Act
15 26. CEQA requires state and local agencies to identify the potentially significant
16 environmental impacts of their actions, and then to avoid or mitigate those impacts if feasible.
17 27: CEQA requires that an agency analyze the potential environmental impacts of its

18 proposed actions in an environmental impact report (except in certain limited circumstances). (See, e.g.,

19 PRC § 21100, et seq. The EIR is the very heart of CEQA. Dunn-Edwards v. BAAQMD (1992) 9

20 Cal.App.4th 644, 652.) "The 'foremost principle' in interpreting CEQA is that the Legislature intended

21 the act to be read so as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable

22 scope of the statutory language." (Cmtys. for a Better Env't v. Cal. Resources Agency (2002) 103
Cal.App.4th 98, 109.)
23 28. CEQA has two primary purposes. First, CEQA is designed to inform decision makers
24 and the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of a project. (14 Cal. Code Reg.
25 ("CEQA Guidelines") § 15002(a)(1).) "Its purpose is to inform the public and its responsible officials
26 of the environmental consequences of their decisions before they are made. Thus, the EIR "protects not

27 only the environment but also informed self-government." (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of

28 Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564). The EIR has been described as "an environmental. 'alarm bell'

-5-
[PROPOSED] THIRD AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

whose purpose it is to alert the public and its responsible officials to environmental changes before they

2 ha've reached ecological points of no return." (Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay v. Bd. of Port Comrs.

3 (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1354 ("Berkeley Jets").)
29. Second, CEQA requires public agencies to avoid or reduce environmental damage when
4 "feasible" by requiring "environmentally superior" alternatives and all feasible mitigation measures. (14
5 CCR § 15002(a)(2) and (3); Citizens of Goleta Valley, supra, 52 Cal.3d at 564.) The EIR serves to
6 provide agencies and the public with information about the environmental impacts of a proposed project
7 and to "identify ways that environmental damage can be avoided or significantly reduced." (CEQA

8 Guidelines § 15002(a)(2).).

9 30. Finally, CEQA requires public agencies to consider the environmental effects of a Project

10 prior to approving a Project as part of a public agency's decision-making process. Section 21002.1(d) of

11 the Cal. Public Resources Code requires a public agency to "consider[] the effects, both individual and
collective, of all activities involved in a project."
12 31. CEQA requires that a public agency considers approval of a Project is required
13 concurrently with the public agency's decision as to whether to approve or disapprove a specific project.
14 Section 21003(a) of the Cal. Public Resources Code specifically requires that [l]ocal agencies integrate
15 the requirements of this division with planning and environmental review procedures otherwise required
16 by law or by local practice so that all those procedures, to the maximum feasible extent, run

17 concurrently, rather than consecutively.

18 32. Consistent with the mandate that the CEQA process runs concurrently with a public

19 agency's decision as to whether to approve or disapprove a specific project, CEQA requires that a public

20 agency considers a project's environmental impacts when "determining whether to approve the project"
CEQA Guidelines § 15093(a).
21 33.
22 A project is approved for the purposes of CEQA when a public agency commits "to a
definite course of action . . . [including an] entitlement for use of the project." (CEQA Guidelines §
23 15352).

24 34. A CEQA determination cannot be finalized prior to approval of a project. (Cty. of Amador
25 v. El Dorado Cty. Water Agency, 76 Cal. App. 4th 931, 965 (1999) (citing CEQA Guidelines § 15352(a);

26 Coalition for Clean Air v. City of Visalia (2012) 209 Cal. App. 4th 408, 423.)
35.
27 Similarly, a CEQA determination cannot be adopted after a project has been approved.

28 Save Tara V. City of West Hollywood (2008) 45 Cal. 4th 116, 127, 132 (finding that subsequent
"preparation and certification of an EIR" does not render a lawsuit moot and that "an agency has no
-6-
[PROPOSED] THIRD AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

discretion to define approval so as to make its commitment to a project precede the required preparation

2 of an EIR.").
36.
3 CEQA requires that public agency allow the public to appeal a CEQA determination to a

4 public "agency's elected decision making body." (PRC § 21151(c)). A CEQA determination and project
approval is not "final" until "the final adjudicatory administrative decision." (Hensler v. City of
5 Glendale (1994) 8 Cal. 4th 1, 22).

6 37. The required CEQA environmental review involves both substantive and procedural
steps. Public participation plays an important and protected role in the CEQA process. (Laurel Heights

8 Improvement Association v. Regents of the University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392 ("The
EIR process protects not only the environment but also informed self government."); Concerned

10 Citizens of Costa Mesa, Inc. v. 32nd District Agricultural Association (1986) 42 Cal.3d 929, 936

11 (members of the public have a "privileged position" in the CEQA process)), "Each public agency should|
include provisions in its CEQA procedures for wide public involvement, formal and informal, consistent
12 with its existing activities and procedures, in order to receive and evaluate public reactions to
13 environmental issues related to the agency's activities." (CEQA Guidelines§ 15201). The lead agency
14 must consider all "comments it receives on a draft environmental impact report, proposed negative
15 declaration, or proposed mitigated declaration." (PRC § 21091(d)(1); CEQA Guidelines 15074(b)).

16 38. Procedurally, a lead agency may not approve project until the public has been given a

17 full and adequate opportunity to participate and comment on the project.

18 39. CEQA also disallows approval of a project that fails to comply with other laws. A lead

19 agency may not approve a project with significant unavoidable impacts unless it is "otherwise

20 permissible under applicable laws and regulations." (PRC § 21002.1(c).)
PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL
21 40. This proceeding involves enforcement of important rights affecting the public interest.
22 Issuance of the relief requested in this First Amended Petition will confer a substantial benefit on the
23 public, including citizens, residents, businesses and taxpayers of the City, and will result in the
24 enforcement of important public rights by requiring Respondents to comply with CEQA and other legal

25 requirements applicable to the proposed Project; by voiding the Project approvals and prohibiting.

26 Respondents and Real Parties in Interest from taking further actions with respect to the Project until it

27 has complied with those legal requirements; and by prohibiting the Respondents from undertaking any

28 portion of the Project until they have fully complied with these legal requirements
41. Petitioners are entitled to recover attorneys' fees as provided in Code of Civil Procedure
-7-
[PROPOSED] THIRD AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

section 1021.5 if they prevail in this action. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement of these

2 public rights entitle Petitioners to an award of reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to that section.
STATEMENT OF FACTS
42. In February of 2013, Real Party submitted applications to the City to redevelop the
4 Project Site ("Project Applications"). The Real Party applied for a subdivision of the Project Site from
:: 5 one 562,314 net square-foot parcel into four lots, Case No. AA-2012-919-PMLA, as well as for a Site

7 2013-887-SPR.

8 43. The Project Site is located at 4051 South Alameda Street, 1700-1838 East Martin Luther

9 King Jr. Boulevard, 1708-1835 East 40th Place, 1707-1843 East 41st Street, and 4014 and 4066 South

10 Long Beach in the City of Los Angeles. The Project Site is legally described as EAST JEFFERSON

11 STREET TRACT NO EX OF ST LOT 106 AND ALL OF LOTS 107 THRU 115, also known as APN
No. 5117021020.
12 44. In May of 2013, the City circulated an Initial Study 'Mitigated Negative Declaration
13 environmental document on the Project. The environmental documentation for the Project were assigned
14 Case Nos. ENV-2012-920-EIR by the City and SCH No.2014061030 by the State Clearinghouse.
15 45. After receiving numerous comments on the Initial Study / Mitigated Negative
16 Declaration for the Project, the City opted to prepare a full environmental impact report.

17 46. The Draft Environmental Impact Report for the Project was circulated to the public for

18 public comment between January 22, 2015, and March 9, 2015.

19 47. The Final Environmental Impact Report for the Project was released on June 16, 2016.
48.
20 On July 6, 2016, the City's Deputy Advisory Agency and Planning Department
conducted a public hearing on the Project.
21 49. On September 23, 2016, the City's Deputy Advisory Agency and Planning Department
22 approved the Project and findings related to the Project, including approval of the subdivision for the
23 Project (AA-2012-919-PMLA) and the Site Plan Review (DIR-2013-887-SPR) for the Project, as well
24 as certifying the Project's environmental impact report and adopting a statement of overriding
25 considerations (ENV-2012-920-EIR, SCH No. 2014061030). (Deputy Advisory Agency's September

26 23, 2016 decision").

27 50. On October 11, 2016, Mr. Tezozomoc of South Central Farmers appealed the September

28 23, 2016, decision to the City's Planning Commission in its entirety including the subdivision for the
Project (AA-2012-919-PMLA), the Site Plan Review (DIR-2013-887-SPR), as well as the Project's

environmental impact report and statement of overriding considerations (ENV-2012-920-EIR, SCH No.

2 2014061030) ("October 11, 2016 appeal").
51. On November 10, 2016, the City Planning Commission conducted a public hearing on
the Project, approved the Project, and denied Mr. Tezozomoc's October 11, 2016, appeal, sustaining and
4 adopting the findings of the Deputy Advisory Agency's September 23, 2016, decision which included
5 the subdivision for the Project (AA-2012-919-PMLA), the Site Plan Review (DIR-2013-887-SPR), and
6 the Project's environmental impact report and statement of overriding considerations (ENV-2012-920-
7 EIR, SCH No. 2014061030 ("Planning Commission's November 10, 2016 decision"),

8 52. On December 15, 2016, Mr. Tezozomoc of South Central Farmers appealed the Planning

9 Commission's November 10, 2016, decision to the City Council in its entirety, including the subdivision

10 for the Project (AA-2012-919-PMLA) ("Subdivision"), the Site Plan Review (DIR-2013-887-SPR)

11 ("Site Plan Review"), and the Project's environmental impact report and statement of overriding

12 considerations (ENV-2012-920-EIR, SCH No. 2014061030) ("CEQA Determination" or collectively
with the Subdivision and Site Plan Review as "December 15, 2016 appeal"). However, the City only
13 accepted the appeal of the Project's CEQA Determination, taking the position that the Subdivision and
14 Site Plan Review were final as of the Planning Commission's November 10, 2016 decision to approve
15 the Project and certify the EIR.

16 53. On March 7, 2017, the City Planning and Land Use Management Committee, a
17° subcommittee of the City Council ("PLUM"), conducted a public hearing on the Project, recommending

18 that the City Council deny Mr. Tezozomoc's December 15, 2016, appeal, and upheld the Planning

19 Commission's November 10, 2016, decision. (*PLUM's March 7, 2017 decision").
54.
20 On March 21, 2017, the City Council conducted a hearing on the Project and denied the

21 Mr. Tezozomoc's December 15, 2016, appeal and upheld PLUM's March 7, 2017 decision.

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Violations of CEQA; Failure to Substantially Support Factual Findings and Overriding

3 Considerations)
59.
4 Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate all the above paragraphs as if fully set forth
herein.
5 60. CEQA requires that a lead agency's findings for the approval of a project be supported by

12 significant or that adopted mitigation measures would avoid or lessen the
Project's significant effects on the environment.
13 b. The determinations that alternatives to the Project and proposed mitigation
14 measures that would have avoided or lessened the significant impacts of the
15 Project were infeasible, including but not limited to the no-Project alternative and

16 the other alternatives examined in the EIR; and

17 C. The determinations that other environmental impact were significant and

18 unavoidable and had been mitigated to the extent feasible.
62.
19 As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by

20 making determinations or adopting findings and a Statement of Overriding Considerations that do not

21 comply with the requirements of CEQA and approving the Project in reliance thereon. Accordingly,

3 body, as part of CEQA's mandate that the public be given a full and adequate opportunity to participate
and comment on a project and for lead agency to fully consider the public reactions to a project's 4 environmental impacts.
5 66. Respondents violated CEQA by declaring the Planning Commission's November 10,
6 2016 decision to approve the Project as final and not allowing the project approvals and EIR
7 certification to be appealed to City Council, even though the Project's EIR was not certified until March

8 21, 2016 when the City Council denied Mr. Tezozomoc's appeal.
