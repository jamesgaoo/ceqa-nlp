Writ Petition

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. This action challenges the approvals by Respondent City of Encinitas ("City" or

3 "Respondent") of the North Coast Highway 101 Streetscape Project ("Project"), and the related failure

4 to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Pub. Res. Code ยง 21000, et seq.,

5 the Coastal Act, the City's General Plan, Local Coastal Plan, North 101 Corridor Specific Plan, and the

6 Public Trust.

7 2. The Project involves reductions in the number of travel lanes along scenic and historic

8 Coast Highway 101 and the construction of roundabouts and other streetscape modifications within the

9 Leucadia community in the City.

10 3. Among other things, the City failed to adequately consider the environmental and

11 cumulative impacts associated with the Project, failed to adequately prepare, circulate, and consider

12 required environmental analysis, failed to consider and adopt feasible alternatives, and failed to

13 provide meaningful and measurable mitigation measures. The City also violated its General Plan,

14 Local Coastal Plan, the Encinitas North 101 Corridor Specific Plan, and the California Coastal Act. It

15 also violated public easement rights and the Public Trust in approving the Project.

16 4. Petitioner seeks alternative and peremptory writs of mandate declaring the City's approvals
17 invalid, and enjoining the City from taking steps to implement the approvals.

18 PARTIES

19 5. Petitioner Encinitas Residents Coalition is an unincorporated association of residents and

20 neighbors in Encinitas created after approval of the Project. Petitioner's goal is to carefully address all
21 development and growth issues in the City of Encinitas for the protection and well-being of its citizens,

22 unique community character and environment. Petitioner seeks to protect the environment, community

23 character, public health, safety, and scenic viewshed in the North Coast Highway 101 Corridor, and to

24 hold its public officials accountable to the citizens of Encinitas and the State of California. Petitioner and

25 its members have been injured as a result of Respondent's actions. Petitioner and its members use, enjoy

26 and benefit from the resources affected by Respondent's actions. Respondent's actions adversely affect

27 the health, safety, social, recreational, vocational, aesthetic, scientific, and environmental interests of

28

Encinitas Residents Coalition V. City of Encinitas Page 2
Writ Petition

1 Petitioner and of Petitioner's members. The interests of Petitioner and Petitioner's members have been

2 and will continue to be adversely affected by Respondent's unlawful actions. The relief sought in this

3 Petition would redress Petitioner's and Petitioner's members' injuries.

4 6. Respondent City of Encinitas is a political subdivision of the State of California and a body

5 corporate and politic exercising local government powers, as specified by the Constitution and the laws of

6 the State of California.

7 7. Petitioner does not know the true names or capacities of the persons or entities sued herein as

8 Does 1 through 5, and therefore sue these respondents by such fictitious names. Petitioner will amend the

9 Petition to set forth the names and capacities of said respondents along with appropriate charging
10 allegations when the same have been ascertained.

11 PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND HISTORY

12 8. The Project involves a 2.5-mile segment of North Coast Highway 101 between La Costa

13 Avenue at the north end and A Street at the south end, in the community of Leucadia within the City of

14 Encinitas.

15 9. The Circulation Element of the City's General Plan designates this portion of North Coast

16 Highway 101 as a 4-lane Major Arterial.

17 10. Currently, the Project Corridor is a scenic and historic 4-lane roadway between A Street

18 and Leucadia Boulevard. Between Leucadia Boulevard and La Costa Avenue it provides one

19 "through" vehicle lane and a bike lane in the northbound direction, and it provides: it "through" vehicle

20 land and a shared vehicle/bicycle lane in the southbound direction.

21 11. The corridor is a portion of one of the most heavily traveled routes anywhere in the City.

22 Drivers are experiencing increased traffic congestion and neighboring residents are experiencing

23 increased cut-through traffic onto residential streets adjacent to the Coast Highway.

24 12. This segment of the Coast Highway is the primary ingress and egress corridor for residents

25 living on the west side of the highway, as they travel to destinations north, south and east. It is also

26 used by visitors to the area seeking to access the beaches and coastline.

27

28

Encinitas Residents Coalition v. City of Encinitas
Writ Petition Page 3

13. Signalized intersections occur at Leucadia Boulevard and at La Costa Avenue. An all-way

2 stop-controlled intersection occurs at Marcheta Street near the south end of the corridor. All remaining

3 side streets intersecting the corridor are stop controlled.

4 14. There has been historic and continued use of the unimproved NTD right of way for parking

5 along the east side of the North Coast Highway 101 through the corridor. On-street parallel parking is

6 available along the west side of the corridor. There are no public parking lots within the corridor.

7 15. Drainage problems have been frequent along many portions of the corridor, with excessive

8 ponding and flooding in several areas.

9 16. Fire Department Emergency response times to the Northwest portion of the City, located
10 within the Project Corridor, have often not been able to meet the requisite standards for emergency

11 service response within 5 minutes 80% of the time.

12 17. The corridor contains several mature trees, many of which surround and provide enclosure

13 over the streets and walkways. There is a center median that provides landscaped buffer through

14 much of the corridor. Many of the trees date back to the early settlers of the region, are over 100 years

15 old, and provide an important role in defining the unique community character along the corridor.

16 18. On the west side of the Leucadia Boulevard intersection, Leucadia Roadside Park provides

17 an open space area with a lawn and trees.

18 19. The corridor generally contains the North Coast Transit District railroad right-of-way on its

19 east side and several mainly one- and two-story businesses, restaurants, hotels and other commercial
20  establishments on its west side. Collectively, the structures, many of which date back to the mid-

21 1900s, form an eclectic blend of architecture that is distinctively "Leucadia."

22 20. All properties along the side streets to the west of the corridor support residential land uses.

23 The neighborhood residential side streets are generally formed into a street grid pattern or terminate at

24 Neptune Avenue, which extends north-south atop the bluff edge to the Pacific Ocean.

25 21. The railroad tracks run along the east end of the corridor and Vulcan Avenue, a two-lane

26 Collector Street, runs parallel to the corridor east of the train tracks. Land uses are primarily

27 residential along Vulcan Avenue, although there are some commercial businesses and Paul Ecke

28 Elementary School.

4 22. A Coast Rail Trail is planned for pedestrian and bicycle pathways within the NCTD right-

5 of-way, directly east and adjacent to the Coast Highway Project Corridor.

6 23. The Project includes the reduction in the number of lanes in each direction, the addition of

7 bike lanes on both sides of the roadway, six new roundabouts, crosswalks, a new median, bus turnout

8 bays along the east side of Highway 101, improvements to the existing sidewalk on the west side of

9 Coast Highway 101, new landscaping, stormwater improvements and other revisions to existing on and

10 off street parking along Highway 101.

11 24. In early 2008 the City initiated the Leucadia Streetscape project to create a concept plan.

12 25. At a January 13, 2010 City Council meeting, staff presented an overview of a design and

13 process, including plan alternatives, design and traffic calming concepts, and traffic analysis. The City

14 Council directed staff to move forward with "Alternative 4A Concept Plan."

15 26. At a December 15, 2010 City Council meeting, the City Council directed staff to move

16 forward with implementation of "Refined Phase 1" of the plan.

17 27. On September 11, 2013, the City Council authorized the Director of Public Works to enter

18 into an agreement with a consultant to provide design services for "Refined Phase 1.3

19 28. On April 8, 2015, staff updated the City Council to present the changes that occurred

20 between the 2010 4A Concept Plan and the refined 4A30% Design Plan.

21 29. On or about December 2, 2016, a Draft EIR regarding the Project was made available for

22 public review. The City subsequently amended a portion of the Draft EIR, which was recirculated on

23 or about March 14, 2017.

24 30. The City received numerous comment letters on the Draft EIR and the recirculated Draft

25 EIR, including from Petitioner's members. Additional comments were submitted after the close of the

26 comment period on the draft EIR.

27 31. Comments noted the Project's impacts, including impacts to community character, traffic

28 and circulation, safety, parking, noise, lighting, public services, and other issues.

Encinitas Residents Coalition V. City of Encinitas Writ Petition Page 5

:

1 32. Commenters also noted that the EIR had failed to consider impacts to intersections and

2 roadways adjacent to the Project area. The City defined the "Project area" too narrowly, thereby

3 ignoring impacts in locations just outside of the Project corridor.

4 33. Commenters also noted the City had adequately failed to analyze and pursue an

5 environmentally superior alternative.

6 34. On March 1, 2018, the Planning Commission considered the Project and EIR. Testimony

7 was received. The Planning Commission voted to recommend approval of the Project and EIR, as well

8 as to recommend adoption of amendments to the General Plan, Local Coastal Plan and North 101

9 Corridor Specific Plan.

10 35. On March 21, 2018, the City Council met to consider the Project and EIR. Testimony,

11 including from Petitioner's members, was received regarding several concerns. Again, concerns about
12 the methodologies of traffic assessments, cut through traffic onto neighboring residential streets,
13 emergency response times, and environmental impacts were expressed, as well as other concerns.

14 Despite these concerns, the City Council voted to approve the Project and EIR. Approvals included
15 approving: (1) Resolution No. 2018-35, approving the EIR, findings, a Statement of Overriding

16 Considerations, and a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program; (2) Resolution No. 2018-34,

17 approving a Design Review Permit and e Coastal Development Permit; and (3) the first reading of

18 Ordinance No. 2018-05, amending the General Plan, North 101 Corridor Specific Plan, and Local Coastal

19 Program.

20 36. On April 18, 2018, the City Council met to consider the second reading of Ordinance No.
21 2018-05. Again, Petitioner's members expressed concerns about the Project and its impacts. The City

22 Council approved the second reading of Ordinance No. 2018-05.

23 37. Notices of Determination were filed on March 28, 2018 and April 19, 2018.

24 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

25 AND INADEQUATE REMEDIES AT LAW

26 38. Petitioner exhausted all available administrative remedies, and objections to the Project

27 have been presented orally and in writing to the City, as required by Public Resources Code Section

28

Encinitas Residents Coalition v. City of Encinitas Writ Petition Page 6

1 21177. These include, but are not limited to, letters and oral comments presented during public
2 hearings.

3 39. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code Section 21167.5

4 by mailing a written notice of commencement of this action to the City. A true and correct copy of

5 that notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.

6 40. Petitioner has advised the City that Petitioner has elected to prepare the record of

7 proceedings relevant to the approval of the Project, pursuant to Public Resources Code Section

8 21167.6. A true and correct copy of that notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.

9 41. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code Section 21167.7 by filing a copy of

10 the original petition with the California Attorney General. A true and correct copy of the notification

11 is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.

12 42. Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law unless the Court grants the requested writ of

13 mandate requiring the City to set aside its approval of the Project and the FEIR. In the absence of such

14 remedy, the City's approvals will remain in effect in violation of State law, and Petitioner will suffer

15 irreparable harm because of the significant adverse environmental impacts generated by the Project.

16 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

17 (FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH CEQA PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS)

18 43. Petitioner incorporates by reference each of the allegations set forth in this Petition as if set

5 49. Petitioner incorporates by reference each of the allegations set forth in this Petition as if set

6 forth herein in full.

7 50. Respondents' approval of the FEIR constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion in that the

8 FEIR is not in accord with CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, and case law, but rather is legally inadequate

18 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

19 (FAILURE TO ADOPT FEASIBLE MITIGATION MEASURES AND ALTERNATIVES REQUIRED BY CEQA)

20 52. Petitioner incorporates by reference each of the allegations set forth in this Petition as if set

21 forth herein in full.

22 53. Respondents failed to consider and adopt feasible alternatives, including but not limited to,

23 alternatives requiring less impacts that meet some or all of the Project objectives.

24 54. Respondents defined the Project and its objections too narrowly, resulting in a narrowing of

25 the consideration of alternatives.

26 55. Respondents failed to adopt the environmentally superior alternative.

27

28

Encinitas Residents Coalition v. City of Encinitas Page 12

1 56. Respondents failed to consider and adopt feasible mitigation measures, failed to mitigate for

2 each environmental effect, illegally deferred mitigation, and failed to provide for effective and enforceable

3 mitigation.

4

5 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION (FAILURE TO ADOPT FINDINGS THAT ARE SUPPORTED BY EVIDENCE IN THE

6 RECORD)

7 57. Petitioner incorporates by reference each of the allegations set forth in this Petition as if set
forth herein in full.
8

9 58. Respondents failed to adopt findings that are supported by substantial evidence in the

10 record. Among other things, the findings assert that the Project's mitigation measures adequately

11 reduce impacts below a level of significance without adequate evidence in the record to support such

12 findings, and the findings assert that the Project will be consistent with General Plan and other

13 requirements where there is insufficient evidence to support such consistency findings.

14 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION
(FAILURE TO ADOPT A STATEMENT OF OVERRIDING CONSIDERATIONS THAT IS

15 SUPPORTED BY EVIDENCE IN THE RECORD)

16 59. Petitioner incorporates by reference each of the allegations set forth in this Petition as if set
forth herein in full.
17

18 60. Respondents failed to adopt a Statement of Overriding Considerations that is supported by

19 substantial evidence in the record despite the Project's significant environmental impacts.
SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION
20 (VIOLATION OF GENERAL PLAN AND OTHER POLICY REQUIREMENTS)

21

22 61. Petitioner incorporates by reference each of the allegations set forth in this Petition as if set
forth herein in full.
23

24 62. The Project violates and is inconsistent with the City's General Plan and Local Coastal Plan,

25 including but not limited to Land Use Element Policies 2.10, 6.5 and 7.8, Circulation Element Policies

26 1.12, 2.7, 3.4, and 3.11, and Resource Management Element Goal 6.

27 63. The Project violates and is inconsistent with the Public Safety Element of the General Plan

28 for a number of reasons including, Highway 101 is an emergency evacuation route and the project

Encinitas Residents Coalition V. City of Encinitas Writ Petition Page 13

1 would impact that route, and the impacts on traffic from the Project would slow response time for

2 emergency vehicles.

3 64. The Project also violates the North 101 Corridor Specific Plan. The Project violates and is

4 inconsistent with the North Corridor 101 Specific Plan (Specific Plan) including but not limited to

5 provisions related to Circulation Plan ยง 5, Public Facilities and Infrastructure ยงยง 6.0-6.3, Resource

6 Management ยง 9.5, Circulation ยง 9.3, and Noise 8 9.7.

7 65. Section 6.1 of the Specific Plan specifically provides that "Police and fire services will not

8 be negatively impacted by the land use changes in the specific plan." It further reiterates that "Public

9 services are citywide services provided for the protection, health and safety of the community's

10 individuals," (Specific Plan, ยง 6.2.1) and that implementation "will not specifically impact the fire

11 services in the area." (Specific Plan ยง 6.2.2). The Project violates these provisions.

12 66. Furthermore, the Resource Management provisions of the Specific Plan provide that

13 "[m}ature trees shall not be removed or disturbed to provide public right -of-way improvements if such

14 improvements can be deferred, redesigned, or eliminated." (Specific Plan ยง 9.5, Policy 3.2). The
15 Project violates this provision by including tree removal.

16 67. The Project violates and is inconsistent with the City's Design Guidelines.

17 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

18 (VIOLATION OF THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL ACT)

19 68. Petitioner incorporates by reference each of the allegations set forth in this Petition as if set
forth herein in full.
20

21 69. The Project violates and is inconsistent with the California Coastal Act. Public access and

22 availability is a major tenant of both the Coastal Act and the City's certified Local Coastal Program.

23 Rather than maximize public access to and along the coast as required by the Coastal Act, the Project

24 would degrade and limit coastal access in a variety of ways.

25 70. Among other things, the Project impacts the public's ability to access the beach or enjoy a

26 recreational drive along the coast on the historic Coast Highway. The Project would also increase the

27 time it takes to travel on Highway 101 which could deter the public from traveling to the beach.

28

Encinitas Residents Coalition v. City of Encinitas Writ Petition Page 14

71. Additionally, the EIR for the Project fails to analyze weekend and summer traffic condition,
2 which also effects beach access. These traffic conditions limit public access to and along the coast and
3 public recreational opportunities in violation of the Coastal Act.

4 72. The City also failed to fully analyze historic public parking. The Project would eliminate
5 the ability for the public to continue parking in the informal dirt parking arca that the public has used

6 for many years and that serves as an important public access resource. The loss of this public parking
7 limits public access to and along the coast and public recreational opportunities in violation of the

8 Coastal Act.

9 73. Furthermore, the piecemeal development violates the Coastal Act. A complete EIR for all
10 related public works projects currently planned in the same corridor should be done.

11 EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION

12 (VIOLATION OF EASEMENT RIGHTS, AND PUBLIC TRUST)

13 74. Petitioner incorporates by reference each of the allegations set forth in this Petition as if set
forth herein in full.
14

15 75. Members of the public have utilized portions of the Project Property for many years as a

16 public parking area. This consistent and consecutive use for the requisite period had ripened into an

17 implied dedication of the property for use as a public parking area, and the public has gained easement

18 rights to the property.

19 76. As a result of the longstanding public parking use a public trust has been created.

20 77. The approval of the Project violated the public trust by allowing for a use of the restricted
