28 -1-

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

F Public Financing Authority, (collectively "City" or "Respondents") in approving land use,

2 building and other permits ("Approvals") for an aggregate intermodal terminal owned, leased or

4 PI BELL PARCEL III, LLC; PI BELL PARCEL IV, LLC; PI BELL PARCEL V, LLC; PD

7 Development Agreement 2013-1 "Scope of Development," "Conditions of Approval,"

8 "Development Standards," "List of Permitted Uses," of the Calfornia Environmental Quality Act

9 ("CEQA") including the Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program ("MMRP") for the Site.

10 This First Amended Petition amends the original Petition filed Janaury 22, 2018

11 JURISDICTION

12 2. This Court has jurisdiction under Code. Civ. Proc. § 1085 (mandamus actions).

13 The parties and the Project Site are located in the County of Los Angeles. A notice of intent to

14 sue was mail served January 19, 2018 and is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

15 PARTIES

16 3. Petitioner East Yard Communities for Environmental Justice ("East Yard") is a

17 non-profit corporation located at 2317 Atlantic Bl., Commerce CA 90040 whose members

18 include affected individuals who have a beneficial interest in the matters set forth in this Petition.

19 Petitioner's mission is to ensure environmentally sustainable development in the I-710 corridor

20 and informed decisionmaking by public officials with regard to consistency with development

21 plans for the Site. East Yard sent a letter dated January 13, 2018 to the City raising concerns

22 about the issues herein. Petitioner Lopez is a member.

23 4. Petitioner Mark Lopez frequents the location, the intersections at and in the

24 vicinity of the Project regularly, and will be affected by the Respondents' failure to follow the

25 substantive and procedural requirements of its zoning laws and CEQA. He wrote the letter dated

26 January 13, 2018 to the City raising concerns about the issues herein. His interests will be

27 directly affected until Respondents comply with governing laws in connection with the Project.

28 -2-

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 5. Respondent City of Bell and its Public Finance Authority is California municipal

2 corporation chartered under the Constitution and laws of the State of California and located in the
County of Los Angeles, California that permits the Project and enforces the governing

4 Development Agreement 2013-1 "Scope of Development," "Conditions of Approval,"

5 "Development Standards" or "List of Permitted Uses" and EIR for the Site.

6 6. Real Parties PI BELL, LLC; PI BELL PARCEL I, LLC; PI BELL PARCEL II,

7 LLC; PI BELL PARCEL III, LLC; PI BELL PARCEL IV, LLC; PI BELL PARCEL V, LLC are

8 Delaware limited liability companies believed to be the Project applicant and recipient of the

9 Development Agreement 2013-1.

10 7. Real Party in Interest PD Development, Inc. a is a California company believed to

11 be the lessee of the Site and building the Project.

12 8. Real Party in Interest CEMEX Construction Materials Pacific, LLC is a Delaware a

13 LLC believed to be the sublessee of the Site and building the Project.

14 9. The true names, capacities, corporate, associate or otherwise of Respondents and

15 Real Parties named herein as DOES 1 through 5 8 and 8 and 10, inclusive, are unknown to

16 Petitioners who, therefore, sue said Respondents and Real Parties by fictitious names. Petitioners

17 will amend this Petition to show the true names and capacities when they have been ascertained.

18 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

19 10. Petitioners have long history of working towards environmentally sustainable

20 development at this specific Site, including successful CEQA litigation against the City and

21 BNSF in 2008. East Yard Communities v. Bell Public Financing Authority, LASC Case No.

22 BS111726. Bast Yard also participated extensively in the "Bell Business Center" environmental

23 impact report ("EIR" SCH # 2013041035) process for the Site in 2013.

24 11. On November 30, 2017, pursuant to their November 13, 2017 Public Records Act

25 request, Petitioners were provided documents about the proposed Project at the Site and upon

26 review discovered for the first time that it appears to be an open-air transfer terminal for rock,

27 sand, dirt, and gravel unloaded by the rail spur at the Site. Petitioners sued within 90 days of

28 -3-

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 learning of the Project. Project Approvals include but are not limited to land use and building

2 permits issued December 15, 2016 and March 15, 2018 including up to the present. No CEQA

3 Notice of Determination was filed for the Project Approvals.

4 12. The Site EIR states "the intent of the proposed project is to construct sufficient

5 building area to allow all uses to be conducted in an enclosed building" (p. 3.9-9). In fact, all

6 proposed Site plans in the EIR show an enclosed building at the Site. Nothing like this Project

7 was ever contemplated or studied for the Site.

13. Moreover, the governing Development Agreement 2013-1 "Scope of

9 Development," "Conditions of Approval," "Development Standards" or "List of Permitted Uses"

10 state that "[g]round mounted machinery and utilities shall be enclosed." Also the Project is

11 impermissibly using K Street to access Parcel A, which was supposed to be discontinued.

12 Petitioners believe that there are a host of zoning conditions from the governing Development

13 Agreement 2013-1 and MMRP that cannot be satisfied for an open-air gravel terminal. This

14 Project will have aesthetic, hydrology, air quality, land use impacts, etc. not analyzed in the EIR.

15 14. Petitioners believe that the Project was approved without compliance with

16 procedural requirements of Development Agreement 2013-1, including approval of design plans

17 by a Design Review Board with a more transparent and accountable public process involving

18 elected and appointed official(s) that would have given Petitioners sooner notice of this Project.

19 15. Petitioners understand that gravel and concrete are needed for economic growth in

20 our region. And that they can be transported and stored in many cases in environmentally

21 sensitive ways. However, it is Petitioners' position that this open-air gravel terminal Project does

22 not comply with the governing environmental and land use conditions or procedures for this Site.

23 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

24 (Writ of Mandate and Declaratory Relief- Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1060 and 1085 Violations of Applicable Procedural Land Use Conditions)
25 16. Petitioners restate and reallege Paragraphs 1-15 as if fully set forth herein.
26 17. Petitioners are informed and believe that granting the Project Approvals
27 constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion by Respondents by failing to proceed in the manner
28 -4.

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

required by law as required under the governing Development Agreement 2013-1. This cause of

2 action if for Respondents' failure to follow the procedural requirements and exceeding the

3 exercise of power granted to staff in the governing Development Agreement 2013-1 including but
4 not limited to by issuing the Approvals unlawfully by City staff without prior proper Design

5 Review Board consent under the Cal. Gov. Code and City Municipal Code. As a result, the

6 ninety day limitations period of Gov. Code 65009 does not apply. People ex. rel. Brown v.

7 Tehama County (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 422, 431-432.

8 18. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law other than the relief

9 sought in this Petition. If the Real Parties are not enjoined or stayed from undertaking acts in

10 furtherance of the Project, Petitioners and the public will suffer irreparable harm from which there

11 is no adequate remedy at law in that the Project will be built, operations commence and

12 significant adverse impacts that would occur, contrary to State and local law. Petitioners request

13 a judicial determination of the partie: rights and duties, and the meaning of the terms of the

14 governing Development Agreement 2013-1

15 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

16 (Writ of Mandate and Declaratory Relief- Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1060 and 1085 Violations of Applicable Substantive Land Use Conditions)
17 19. Petitioners restate and reallege Paragraphs 1-18 as if fully set forth herein.
18 20. Petitioners are informed and believe that granting the Project Approvals
19 constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion by Respondents by failing to proceed in the manner
20 required by law as required under the governing Development Agreement 2013-1 "Scope of
21 Development," "Conditions of Approval," "Development Standards" or "List of Permitted Uses."
22 This Project and its construction do not substantially conform to the governing Development
23 Agreement 2013-1 "Scope of Development," "Conditions of Approval," "Development
24 Standards" or "List of Permitted Uses" that fundamentally require, inter alia, one enclosed
25 building at the Site that does not use K Street for its main access. Each new day of failure to
26 enforce the land use conditions for Site development is a continuing violation.

27

28 -5-

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

21. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law other than the relief

2 sought in this Petition. If the Real Parties are not enjoined or stayed from undertaking acts in
furtherance of the Project, Petitioners and the public will suffer irreparable harm from which there

4 is no adequate remedy at law in that the Project will be built, operations commence and

5 significant adverse impacts that would occur, contrary to State and local law. Petitioners request

6 a judicial determination of the parties' rights and duties, and the meaning of the terms of the

7 governing Development Agreement 2013-1.

8 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

9 (Writ of Mandate Mandamus - Code Civ. Proc. § 1085
Violations of CEQA - Additional Environmental Review Needed)
10 22. Petitioners restate and reallege Paragraphs 1-21 as if fully set forth herein.
11 23. The Project Approvals violate the EIR for the Bell Business Center. This is a
12 different project than described and studied in the EIR, All proposed Site plans in the EIR show a
13 covered building at the Site. Nothing like this Project was ever described or studied for the Site.
14 This Project will have significant aesthetic, hydrology, air quality, land use impacts, etc. not
15 analyzed in the EIR. Supplemental environmental review is needed.
16 24. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law other than the relief
17 sought in this Petition. If the Real Parties are not enjoined or stayed from undertaking acts in
18 furtherance of the Project, Petitioners and the public will suffer irreparable harm from which there
19 is no adequate remedy at law in that the Project will be built, operations commence and
20 significant adverse impacts that would occur, contrary to State and local law.

21 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

22 (Writ of Mandate Mandamus • Code Civ. Proc. § 1085
Violations of CEQA - Failure to Follow MMRP Conditions)
23 25. The Project Approvals and Site construction violate the MMRP for the Bell
24 Business Center. The MMRP is not being enforced or implemented for this Project with regard to
25 mitigations including but not limited to air quality, climate/greenhouse gas, job quality, or
26 transportation. Each new day of failure to enforce the MMRP is continuing violation.

RE: CEMEX Project, 5091 Rickenbacker Rd. Bell, CA NOTICE OF INTENT TO SUE

Dear Mayor, Clerk, City Manager and City Engineer:
On behalf of East Yard Communities for Environmental Justice, I respectfully am submitting this second letter to challenge the referenced CEMEX project in the City of Bell.
We wrote on January 13, 2018 requesting a meeting by January 18, 2018 but got no response at all. at
Let this letter notify you under Pub, Res. Code 21167.5 that East Yard and therefore intend to sue the City and its Public Financing Authority for failure to comply with the California Environmental connection with the project. Quality Act in

The project fails to comply with the "Bell Business Center" environmental impact report ("EIR" SCH # 2013041035), its mitigation monitoring reporting program ("MMRP") the applicable Site Development Standards or land use conditions. The EIR clearly states "the intent of the proposed project is to construct sufficient building area to allow all uses to be conducted in an enclosed building" (p. 3.9-9). In fact, all proposed site plans in the EIR show a covered building at the site. Nothing like this project was ever contemplated or studied for the site. Moreover, the applicable Site Development Standards clearly state that "[g]round mounted machinery and utilities shall be enclosed." This project from whal we have recently learned plainly violates that condition. Our position is also supported by the project Development Agreement with PI Bell, LLC Section 4.3 that states that any zoning inconsistency in the documents is governed is first by the EIR. This project will have aesthetic, hydrology, air quality, land use impacts, etc. not analyzed in the EIR. Furthermore, the MMRP is not being enforced or implemented for this Project with regard to mitigations for air quality, climate/greenhouse gas, noise, or transportation. Each new day of failure to enforce the MMRP is a continuing violation.
The lawsuit will seek a writ of mandate and injunctive relief, as well as other relief that the Superior Court deems proper.
