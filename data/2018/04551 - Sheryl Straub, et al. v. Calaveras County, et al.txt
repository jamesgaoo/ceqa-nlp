16 January 10, 2018.

17 4. 1 Petitioners sue respondents DOES 1 through 100, inclusive by fictitious names.
18 Petitioners do so because they are presently unaware of the true names or capacities of DOES
19 through 100 or, alternatively, are presently unaware of what roles such respondents may have
20| played in carrying the wrongdoing described herein. When the true names, capacitics or facts
21| establishing the fictitiously named respondents' culpability are ascertained, Petitioners will
22 amend this Petition to so specify. For now, Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereon
23| alleges, each fictitiously named respondent is responsible in some manner for the conduct
24 described herein. Petitioners conduct each fictitiously named respondent proximately caused or
25| materially contributed to the proximate cause of Petitioners' damages as herein alleged.
26 5. At all times mentioned herein, each of the respondents was and is the agent,
27 servant, and employee of each of the other respondents, and all of the things alleged to have been
28| done by said respondents were done in the capacity of and as agent of the other respondents, in

Petitioners contend this Court has personal jurisdiction over the Respondents and subject matter
10 jurisdiction over the claims asserted in this Petition.
11 7. Petitioners are informed and believe venue properly vests in this Court under
12 three bases. First, all or a substantial portion of the events underlying this Petition occurred in the
13 County, thus, rendering this Court the proper venue under Code of Civil Procedure section 393.

15| entitlement to venue under Code of Civil Procedure section 394. Lastly, Petitioners are informed
16 and believe that this Court has venue over this Petition under Code of Civil Procedure 395
17 because all the Respondents reside in the County.
18 FACTUAL BACKGROUND
19 A. THE COUNTY'S URGENCY ORDINANCE

20 8. Over two decades ago, California started systemically relaxing its onerous
21| limitations on cannabis cultivation and usage throughout the state. On November 5, 1996,
22 California voters passed Proposition 215, commonly referred to as the Compassionate Use Act,
23 which decriminalized the possession and use of cannabis for medical purposes ("CUA").
24 Codified in Health & Safety Code section 11362.5, the CUA authorized caregivers to prescribe,
25 and for seriously ill patients to use, cannabis. Seven years after the CUA's passage, the
26 California Legislature enacted the Medical Marijuana Program Act, expanding the CUA's
27 protections and conferring seriously ill patients and caregivers the right to cultivate medical
28 cannabis.

9. In September 2015, the California Legislature enacted the Medical Cannabis

2 Regulation and Safety Act ("MCRSA"), which decriminalized the commercial cultivation,
manufacture, retail sale, transport, distribution, delivery, and testing of medical cannabis. The
MCRSA created comprehensive state licensing system for commercial cannabis usage and

5 directed local governments to implement regulations governing the approval of cannabis licenses.
6 Two years later, California voters approved another ballot measure concerning cannabis,
Proposition 64, which is known as the California Marijuana Legalization Act (the "CMLA"), and
which is codified in Health & Safety Code section 11362.2(b)(2). The CMLA legalized the
personal use and cultivation of cannabis in California. California's liberalization of the cannabis
10| industry created enormous investment opportunities for commercial cannabis cultivation
11 throughout the state.

12 10. The County's optimal climate and abundance of inexpensive real property
13 resulting from the catastrophic Butte Fire made the County an attractive site for cannabis
14 cultivation. See County Code § 17.95.120(S). On May 10, 2016, the Board responded to the
15 County's perceived rise in cannabis cultivation by adopting an urgency ordinance - the Urgency
16 Ordinance Regulating Medical Cannabis Cultivation and Commercial Uses Involving Medical
17| Cannabis (the "Urgency Ordinance"). The Urgency Ordinance established restrictive land use
18 regulations governing the cultivation, manufacture, testing, distribution, transportation, which
19| constrained the County's cannabis industry's expansion efforts. The County intended to maintain
20 the Urgency Ordinance until it could complete its environmental review and replace the Urgency
21 Ordinance with permanent regulations on commercial cannabis cultivation. (See May 10, 2016,
22 Board of Supervisors "Medical Cannabis Cultivation and Commerce Urgency Ordinance").
23 11. Under the Urgency Ordinance, the County required all commercial cannabis
24 cultivators to register any proposed medical cannabis cultivation site with the County's Planning
25 Department by June 30, 2016. County Code § 17.95.165(A). The Urgency Ordinance also
26 imposed a deadline of May 10, 2016 forall applicants to have satisfied the conditions enumerated
27 in County Code section 17.95.165. County Code 17.95.165(A)(1)-(2). Specifically, the County
28 imposed such conditions to ensure each applicant had made demonstrable progress towards the

development of commercial medical cannabis cultivation site before the registration deadline. ld.
The Urgency Code directed the Planning Department to issue a one year "certificate of
registration" to all applicants who fulfilled the County's cannabis cultivation site registration
requirements and paid the applicable registration fee. County Code § 17.95.165(C).

6 PETITIONERS' REGISTRATION OF COMMERCIAL CANNABIS
CULTIVATION FACILITIES IN THE COUNTY

12. Petitioner Anna Lewis ("Lewis") timely submitted to the County's Planning

8 Department a complete commercial mixed light cannabis registration application covering a
canopy size of 22,000 square feet. Along with her application, Lewis paid the County's

10 applicable registration fee. On August 7, 2017, the County's Planning Department issued a

11 Certificate of Cannabis Cultivation Registration, concluding Lewis had satisfied the County's

12 cannabis cultivation registration requirements.

13 13.

TE Petitioner Sheryl Straub ("Straub") timely submitted to the County's Planning
Department a complete commercial mixed light cannabis registration application similarly
covering a canopy of 22,000 square feet. Along with her application, Straub paid the County's
16 applicable registration fee. On September 22, 2017, the County's Planning Department issued a
17 Certificate of Cannabis Cultivation Registration, concluding Straub had satisfied the County's 18| cannabis cultivation rogistration requirements.

24 In carly 2016, the Board directed the County staff to prepare an ordinance
establishing permanent land use regulations for the cultivation, manufacture, testing, distribution,
25| and storage of medical cannabis cultivation within the County, After drafting the Medical
26

27 Cannabis Cultivation and Commerce Ordinance (the "Regulatory Ordinance"), the County's

28 Planning Department made two critical findings. First, it concluded that the draft Regulatory

BUCHALTER
PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION
LoS AXGELES 4

BN 31894082v1 VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

Ordinance constituted a project under the California Environmental Quality Act (*CEQA") as an
activity that may cause either a direct or a reasonably foresecable indirect physical environmental
change. Pub. Res. Code § 21080(a); 14 Cal. Reg. Code § 15378(a). Second, it determined that
the Regulatory Ordinance may have a significant effect on the environment, thus, requiring it, as
the lead agency, to prepare an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"). 14 Cal. Reg. Code
§§ 15060(d), 15063(a); see Gilroy Citizens for Responsible Planning v. City of Gilroy, 140 Cal
7 App. 4th 911, 927 (2006) (noting that a lead agency need not conduct an initial study when it
8| decided to prepare an EIR).
15. On April 7, 2016, the County issued a Notice of Preparation ("NOP") informing
10 the general public and the required agencies entitled to notice under CEQA. The County's NOP
11 indicated it planned to prepare a draft EIR expounding three issues: (1) the project; (2) the
12 project's probable environmental impact; and (3) the feasible mitigation measures and feasible
13 alternatives to lessen the project's environmental impact. 14 Cal. Reg. Code § 15082(a).
14 16. On November 8, 2016, Calaveras County voters approved a second ordinance,
15 Measure C, requiring all persons engaged in commercial cannabis activity to pay a special
16| Commercial Cannabis Activity Tax ("Measure C Tax"). County Code 3.56.040. The County
17 earmarked taxes collected from the Measure C Tax for its general use fund to use for general
18| governmental purposes. County Code § 3.56.030(C).
19 17. On May 2017, the County posted its draft EIR on its website, provided it to the
20 County clerk, and issued a press release to the general public as directed under CEQA. Pub. Res.

21 Code 21092(b)(3)(A); 14 Cal. Reg. Code § 15087(a). The County's notices informed the general
22 public that its draft EIR was open for public review and comment until June 14, 2017.

23 18. The County's draft EIR identified the Regulatory Ordinance as the "proposed
24| project" and purported to analyze eight categories of environmental impacts. The County also
25 injected into the draft EIR a ban on commercial cannabis operations (the "Ban Ordinance"), 26 which the County misleadingly classified as a feasible alternative to the regulatory ordinance.
27 The Ban Ordinance prohibited new commercial cannabis cultivation, processing, and distribution
28 within the County. Relatedly, the Ban Ordinance required all authorized commercial cannabis

A PHOPESSIONAR CONPORATION 5
LOS ANGELKS VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT
BN 31894082vl

cultivators under the Urgency Ordinance to cease operations and restore their existing cultivation
sites to a suitable alternative use. Section 17.95.050 of the Ban Ordinance also obligated
individual property owners to remove any temporary cannabis cultivation structures and
undertake immediate remediation measures. Specifically, individual property owners were
required to prevent: (1) erosion and run-off; (2) visual blight; (3) illegal diversion of water
supply; (4) contamination of soil; (5) contamination of waters of the State from soil additives; (5)
improper keeping, storage, and disposal of rodenticides, fungicides, herbicides, and pesticides;
and (6) improper keeping, generation, storage, or disposal of hazardous materials which may
harm the public health or the environment. County Code § 17.95.050 (B). The Ban imposed nine
10 additional remediation measures on current owners of former cannabis cultivation sites to restore
11 the sites to suitable subsequent use within 24 months after the Ban became effective. County
12 Code § 17.95.050(C).
13 19. On September 5, 2017, the County issued a Final EIR on the project including
14 written and verbal comments to the draft EIR that the County received from agencies,
15 organizations and individuals and the County's responses to each comment. 14 Cal Reg. Code §
16 15132(b). The County Planning Commission held a public hearing on September 28, 2017, to
17 consider a recommendation to the Board. After the hearing, the County's Planning Commission
18 recommended the Board consider both the Ban ordinance and a stricter regulatory ordinance than
19 initially proposed under the Regulatory Ordinance.
20 20. On January 10, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. the Board convened a special meeting on
21| adopting an Ordinance to replace the County's Urgency Ordinance. According to the County's
22 Agcnda, the Board planned to consider three items: (1) banning or regulating cannabis
23| cultivation; (2) certifying the Final EIR and adopting its findings of fact; and (3) adopting the
24 Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Plan or finding that adopting the ordinance is exempt from
25 CEQA. (Ex. A, pg. 2.) The Board consists of five Supervisors: (1) Michael Oliveira; (2) Clapp;
26 (3) Dennis Mills; (4) Gary Tofanelli; and (5) John Garamendi. In a 3-2 vote, the Board voted to
27 replace the Urgency Ordinance with the Ban Ordinance and certify the final EIR with comments
28 and responses. Three Board members, Supervisors Clapp, Mills, and Tofanelli, voted in lock-step
BUCHALTER
PXOFESSIONAL COXPORATION 6
I.os ANGELES VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT
BN 31894082vl

1 to end commercial cannabis cultivation consistent with their vociferous historical opposition to
2 the County's prior adoption of the Urgency Ordinance. Supervisor Clapp's vote proved the
3 decisive swing vote at the meeting, using his influence to protect his blatant financial interest in
4 banning commercial cannabis cultivation as described in more detail below.

5 21. On January 11, 2018, the County's Planning Department submitted to the County
6| clerk a Notice of Determination noting that the Board approved the project entitled "Calaveras
7| County Medical Cannabis Cultivation and Commercial Ordinance" ("NOD"), (Ex. B, pg. 1.)
8| The County's slapdash NOD does not describe the project as banning commercial cannabis
cultivation consistent with the Board's vote. (Ex. B, pg. 1.) Instead, the County's Planning
10 Department noted the project represented "an ordinance regulating the cultivation and other
11| activities associated with medical cannabis." (Ex. B, pg. 1.) Equally problematic, the County's
12 NOD failed to indicate whether the "project" approved by the Board will have a significant effect
13 on the environment or whether the Board adopted mitigation measures. (Ex. B, pg. 1.)
14 22. Contemporaneous with this Petition, Petitioners will file proof of prior service
15 upon the Respondents of their written notice to commence a proceeding against them for
16 violating CEQA in approving the Ban Ordinance. By serving this notice, Petitioners have
17| complied with Public Resources Code section 2167.5. A copy of the notice, together with the
18 proof of service, is attached to this Petition as Exhibit C and incorporated herein.
19 23. Petitioners will send copy of the Petition to the California Attorney General
20| concurrently with this filing, thereby satisfying the requirements of Public Resources Code
21 section 21167.6.

22 24. Petitioners have no administrative remedy and have no plain, specdy, or adequate
23| remedy at law unless this Court grants this Petition.
24 FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF
25 (Code of Civil Procedure 1094.5: Petition for Writ of Administrative Mandate)

26 25. Petitioners incorporate and re-allege all allegations above as if fully set forth

27 herein.

28 26. Petitioners are entitled to a writ of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure section

BUCHALTER
PROVESSIOSAL 7

BN 31894082vl

1094.5 because: (a) the County proceeded without, or in excess of, its jurisdiction in adopting the
2 Ban Ordinance; (b) the County's proceedings below are based upon a prejudicial abuse of
3 discretion; and (c) the County did not proceed in the manner required by law.

A. THE COUNTY VIOLATED CEQA GUIDELINES IN ENACTING THE BAN
5 ORDINANCE

6 27. The County failed to proceed in a manner required under the CEQA guidelines in
enacting the Ban Ordinance. The County's draft EIR, which it readopted in its it final EIR, suffers

8 from multiple fatal flaws.

28. An agency may abuse its discretion under CEQA either because it failed to comply

10 with CEQA or because it reached factual conclusions unsupported by substantial evidence. Pub.

11 Res. Code § 21168.5; Banning Ranch Conservancy v. City of New Port Beach, 2 Cal. 5th 918,

12 935 (2017). The County's draft EIR. failed to meet CEQA's minimum requirements in approving

13 the Ban Ordinance.

14 a. The County's draft EIR Misleadingly Describes the Project

15 29. An EIR's project description must include: (1) the project location; (2) project

161 objectives; (3) project technical, economic, and environmental characteristics; and (4) intended

17 uses of the EIR. 14 Cal. Reg. Code § 15124. An accurate, stable, and finite project description

18 serves as the linchpin for an informative and legally sufficient EIR. "CEQA requires a lead

19 agency's draft EIR include an accurate and stable project description so that the public and

20 decision makers have enough information to ascertain the environmentally significant effects,

21 assess ways of mitigating them, and consider project alternatives." Sierra Club v. City of Orange,

22 168 Cal. App. 4th 523, 533 (2008). In addition to requiring the project description be accurate

23 and precise, CEQA also requires the project description be sufficiently comprehensive in scope

24 and complete. See County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles, 71 Cal. App. 3d 185, 192-93 (1977)

25 (finding the City of Los Angeles's draft EIR description of a groundwater extraction project

26 imprecise where it shifted in different parts of the EIR.)

27 30. Under Section 2 entitled "Project Description," the draft EIR describes the project

28 as the Regulatory Ordinance. The Regulatory Ordinance explores a comprehensive set of

BUCHALTER
A PHOPESSIONAL CORPORATION 8
LOs ANGELRS VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT
BN 31894082vl

permanent regulations concerning the cultivation, manufacture, testing, distribution,
transportation, and storage of medical marijuana within the County. Yet in the same paragraph,
3 the draft EIR switches its focus, explaining that the Board directed County Counsel and the
4 County Planning Department to prepare an ordinance banning commercial cannabis activity
5 within the County. The draft EIR then proclaims that it may serve as an appropriate CEQA
document for adoption of an ordinance banning such activity even though it identifies the
7 Regulatory Ordinance as the Project. This proclamation, thus, suggests the County effectively
8 substituted the Ban Ordinance as the applicable project. As such, the draft EIR's shifting
description of the "project" inadequately informed the public whether the applicable project being
10| evaluated was the Regulatory Ordinance or the Ban Ordinance.
11 b. The County's Draft EIR Fails to Disclose and Elucidate the Ban Ordinance's
12 Environmental Impacts

13 31. CEQA mandates that a lead agency's draft EIR to include adequate information to

14 ensure it made an informed decision about a project. 4 Cal. Reg. Code 15151. CEQA further

15 requires the lead agency to provide a reasonable, good faith disclosure and analysis of the

16 environmental impacts of the proposed project. 14 Cal. Reg. Code §§ 1544, 15151. The lead

17 agency must evaluate whether a proposed project will result in a significant environmental impact

18 based on substantial evidence. Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 47

19 Cal. 3d 376 (1988). Under Public Resources Code section 21082.2(c), substantial evidence

20 means "enough relevant information and reasonable inferences from this information that a fair

21 argument can be made to support a conclusion, even though other conclusions might also be

22 reached." 14 Cal. Reg. Code § 15384(a).

23 32. Section 1.2.1 identifies seven categories of effects the County found not to be

24 significant if the County were to adopt the Regulatory Ordinance. Those categories include: (1)

25 Agriculture and forestry resources; (2) Geology and Soils; (3) Hazards and Hazardous Materials;

26 (4) Mineral Resources; (5) Public Services; (6) Recreation; and (7) Utilities and Service Systems.

27 Although the County concluded that these seven categories would not produce any significant

28 environmental effect under the Regulatory Ordinance, the draft EIR offers no analysis supporting

BUCHALTER
A FROTESSIDNAL CORPORATION 9
I.OS ANCELES VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT
BN 31894082vl

the related conclusion that the same result would also occur under the Ban Ordinance. The draft

2 EIR omitted any discussion of these categories of potential impacts vis-a-vis the Ban Ordinance,
3 in violation of CEQA. See Banning Ranch Conservancy, 2 Cal. 5th at 935-37 (rejecting an EIR
ignoring consideration of a project's impacts on environmentally sensitive habit areas under the
5 Coastal Act.) The problems with County's dubious overall approach become pellucid when
6 analyzing its consideration of five of the seven identified categories:
7 a. Agriculture and Forestry Resources: The draft EIR fails to include any
8 estimates or analysis of the loss of agricultural or forestry resources due to
9 continued unregulated cannabis cultivation under the Ban Ordinance. Such
10 a activity is a clear and foresecable consequence of the Ban Ordinance
11 according to the draft EIR.
12 b. Geology and Soils: The draft EIR fails to include any analysis whatsoever
13 of the potential impact of continued unregulated cannabis cultivation
14 activities under the Ban Ordinance.

15 C. Hazards and Hazardous Materials: The Draft EIR provides no analysis of
16 hazardous materials-related impacts which may result from continued
17 unregulated cultivation activities under the Ban Ordinance.
18 d. Public Services: The Draft EIR does not analyze the demand for
19 government services or impacts to the provision of existing services which
20 may result from continued unregulated cannabis cultivation activities under
21 the Ban Ordinance. In this regard, the draft EIR does not evaluate the
22 secondary impacts associated with the Ban Ordinance based on the
23 reasonably foreseeable inability of the County to provide necessary
24 governmental services to address continued cannabis cultivation activities.
25 These impacts would be further exacerbated under the Ban Ordinance as a
26 result of the County's need to refund registration fees paid under the
27 Urgency Ordinance and the Measure C tax revenues already paid.
28 C. Utilities and Service Systems: The draft EIR does not include any analysis
BUCHALTER
A PROFESSIOXAL COXPORATION 10
1os AXCELES VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT
BN 31894082vl

1 of the demand for utilities and service systems or impacts to provision of
2 existing utilities which may result from continued unregulated cannabis
3 cultivation activities.

33. The County had sufficient information available in the public record to determine
5 that the effects found not to be significant in the draft EIR for the Regulatory Ordinance in fact
may be potentially significant under the Ban Ordinance. As such, the County's draft EIR lacked
sufficient information to give the public mcaningful review of the Ban Ordinance. CEQA, thus,
8 commanded the County to revise the EIR to evaluate all of the foreseeable impacts of the Ban
Ordinance and then to recirculate the EIR for additional comment before approving the Ban
10 Ordinance. The County's failure to do so violated CEQA.
11 C. The County's NOD Does not Comply with CEQA Guidelines
12 34. After deciding to approve a project for which an EIR has been approved, a lead
13 agency must file a Notice of Determination. Pub. Res. Code § 21108(a); 14 Cal. Reg. Code §
14 15097(g). CEQA directs leads agencies to include ten categories of information in a notice of
15 determination, three of which the County's NOD violated. First, the lead agency's notice of
16 determination must briefly describe the project. 14 Cal. Reg. Code § 15094(b)(2). Second, the
17| lead agency's notice of determination must indicate whether the project in its approved form will
18 have a significant effect on the environment. 14 Cal. Reg. Code § 15094(b)(4). Lastly, the lead
19 agency's notice of determination must indicate whether mitigation measures were made a
20 condition of the project's approval. 14 Cal. Reg. Code § 15094(b)(6).
21 35. The County's NOD violates all three requirements. Although the Board voted to
22 approve the Ban Ordinance, the County's NOD instead describes the approved project as "an
23| ordinance regulating the cultivation and other activities associated with medical cannabis." (Ex.
24| B, pg. 1.) This shorthand summary of the approved project appears to refer to the Regulatory
25 Ordinance, rather than Ban Ordinance. Moreover, the County's NOD leaves blank a line item
26| indicating whether the unclearly described project will have a significant effect on the
27 environment. (Ex. B, pg. 1.) Similarly, the County's NOD does not confirm whether it made
28 mitigation measures a condition of approval of the unclearly described project. (Ex. B, pg. 1.)
BUCHALTER
ORTOXATION 11
IOS ANGELES VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT
BN 31894082vl

The County's NOD presents yet another CEQA violation in its race to enact the Ban Ordinance.
2 36. Petitioners have exhausted all of their administrative remedies before bringing this
3 Petition. On June 9, 2017, Calaveras County Innovative Health ("CCIH") submitted a written
comment to the County's draft EIR raising the same objections that Petitioners reassert in this
5 Petition. Moreover, Petition registered their objections to the County approving the Ban
6 Ordinance. All issues raised in this Petition were timely raised to Respondents. (Pub. Res. Code
7 § 21177.)

8 SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF
9 (Code of Civil Procedure § 1085; Petition for Writ of Administrative Mandate)

10 37. Petitioners incorporate and re-allege all allegations above as if fully set forth

11 herein.

12 38. Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, subdivision (a) authorizes this Court to

13 issue a writ of mandate ordering the County to comply with applicable law, which enjoins the

14 County and the Board Supervisors from engaging in any act the law specifically bars. This

15 section specifically empowers this Court to mandate the Board of Supervisors to perform clear

16 and present ministerial duties imposed by law or to enjoin acts prohibited by law.

17 39. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy at law and are entitled to

18 mandamus relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 on two grounds.

19 A. THE COUNTY'S CERTIFICATION OF ITS FINAL EIR AND APPROVAL OF THE BAN ORDINANCE VIOLATED CEQA GUIDELINES
20 40. As noted above, CEQA guidelines obligated the County's Planning Department to
21 accurately, precisely, and comprehensively describe the proposed project, the Ban Ordinance, in
22 the County's draft EIR. 14 Cal. Reg. Code §§ 1544, 15151. In addition CEQA guidelines
23 directed the County's Planning Department to consider and disclose in the County's draft EIR all
241 the reasonably foreseeable environmental impacts of the County's Ban Ordinance. 14 Cal. Reg.
25 Code $§ 1544, 15151. The County's exclusion of all the reasonably foreseeable environmental
26 impacts of the County's Ban Ordinance impeded the public and the requisite public agency's
27 review of the County's draft EIR. 14 Cal. Reg. Code § 15088.5(a)(4). As such, CEQA mandated

the County's Planning Department to examine all the reasonably foreseeable environmental

4th 1112, 1129 (1993) [Laurel Heights II]. This Court may issue a writ under Code of Civil

7 Petroleum Assn. v. Superior Court, 9 Cal. 4th 559, 566 (1995).
8 B. SUPERVISOR CLAPP'S FAILURE TO ABSTAIN FROM VOTING ON THE
9 COUNTY'S BAN ORDINANCE AND FINAL EIR RENDERS THE BOARD'S
APPROVAL INVALID
10 41. On December 5, 2016, Supervisor Clapp was sworn in as a member of the
11 County's Board. On January 3, 2017, Supervisor Clapp filed a Statement of Economic Interests
12 (FPPC Form 700) with the Fair Political Practices Commission, disclosing his ownership of 11
13 parcels of Property within the County. When Supervisor Clapp filed this form, one of his parcels,
14 located at 1521 County View Drive in Valley Springs, California, abutted a registered
15 commercial cannabis farm. Since he commenced his term on the Board, Supervisor Clapp has
16 repeatedly fulminated against the commercial cannabis cultivation industry's negative impact on
17 real property in the County, including his own, at multiple Board meetings.
18 a. At a January 24, 2017 meeting, Supervisor Clapp stated, "I have
19 property right now that can't rent because of pot farms;"
20 b. At a January 31, 2017 meeting, after claiming the costs associated
21 with cannabis-related fires and criminal prosecutions were about $5 million, respectively,
22 Supervisor Clapp stated, "and we're probably going to lose almost the same on our tourist costs
23 and stuff to people like me who can't rent property and stuff because of it.;"
24 C. At a February 14, 2017 meeting, Supervisor Clapp reiterated that "I
25 do have [a commercial grow] next door to me," and later stated, "*commercial pot has no business
26 where live;" and
27 d. At a February 28, 2017 meeting, while discussing cannabis policy,
28

BUCHALTER
A PROPESSIOXAL CORPORATION 13
LOS ANGELES VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT
BN 31894082vl

Supervisor Clapp stated, "I don't like what's happened to my neighborhood. My neighborhood is
2 horrible the last 12 months."

42. In addition to Supervisor Clapp's public statements, he has voted in favor of
concrete steps to ban commercial cultivation in the County:

a. On January 31, 2017, Supervisor Clapp voted to direct County staff
to prepare a "total ban" ordinance;"

00 b. On April 18, 2017, Supervisor Clapp voted to dissolve an ad hoc
Committee of Supervisors that had been formed to study a permanent successor to the Urgency
Ordinance as an alternative to the ban;" and
10 C.

11 Ordinance. On January 10, 2018, Supervisor Clapp voted in favor of the Ban

12 43. California Code of Regulations section 87100 prohibits public officials from
13 participating in governmental decisions in which they have a financial interest. California Code
14 of Regulations section 81703 in turn expounds a public official's disqualifying financial interest.
15 Under this section, a public official has a financial interest in a decision if it is reasonably
16| foreseeable that the decision will have a material financial effect on the public official. This
17 section includes three examples of disqualifying financial interest, one of which applies here.
18| public official must abstain from voting on a decision, which may materially affect any real A

19 property in which the public official has a direct or indirect interest worth more than $2,000.
20 44. California Code of Regulations section 18701 precludes a public official from
21 participating in a governmental decision if it will have a reasonably foresecable financial effect.
22| A financial effect is reasonably foreseeable that it "can be recognized as a realistic possibility
23 more than hypothetical or theoretical." 2 Cal. Reg. Code § 18701(b).
24 45. Supervisor Clapp has publicly acknowledged at multiple Board meetings that the
25 County's existing commercial cannabis regulations have dissuaded prospective tenants from
26 renting his income-producing property. Based on his avowed criticism of commercial cannabis,
27 Supervisor Clapp's ability to impartially review and vote on the Ban Ordinance and certifying the

LoS ANGHGES 28 EIR were compromised before the January 10, 2018, Board meeting. His coordinated efforts to
14

BN 31894082vl VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

ban commercial cannabis cultivation aimed to enrich himself by improving the profitability of his
2 rental properties. His words and conduct support a reasonable inference that the Ban Ordinance

3 will have an impact on his financial interests. As such, Supervisor Clapp had a mandatory duty
under California Code of Regulations 18700 and 18700 to abstain from voting on the Ban
5 Ordinance and certifying the final EIR with its underlying factual findings.

46. Excluding Supervisor Clapp's vote, the Board's final vote on the Planning
Commission's recommendation to approve the Ban Ordinance and certify the County's final EIR
8 tallied 2-2. As such, the Planning Commission's recommendation should have been deemed
9 rejected by operation of law. Gov. Code § § 54952.6, 65857.

10 THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF
11 (Violation for California Constitution Article I, $ 7)

12 47. Petitioners incorporate and re-allege all allegations above as if fully set forth

13 herein.

14 48. Petitioners bring this cause of action pursuant to Article 1, section 7 of the

15 California Constitution, which provides that a person may not be deprived of life, liberty, or

16 property without due process. The County's actions, as outlined above and below, entitle

17 Petitioners to recover damages against the County for violation of their personal property rights

18 without due process of law.

19 49. The County was, at all times mentioned in this Petition herein, acting under and

20 under State law.

21 50. Petitioners were and are, at all times mentioned in this complaint, property owners

22 in Calaveras County and leased such properties to individuals or businesses that cultivated

23 cannabis pursuant to a license granted to Petitioners by the County for such activity. Under their

24 licenses, Petitioners, and their lessees, expended substantial sums to engage in the cannabis

25 cultivation industry.

26 51. Petitioners had a continuing and reasonable expectation that they would be

27 allowed to cultivate cannabis under the express terms of their license and the licensing scheme
28 imposed by the County. The County imposed strict requirements on Petitioners, to do, among

BUCHALTER
A PROFESSIONAR COMPORAFIOX 15
VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT
BN 31894082vl

other things, provide personal information about Petitioners such as driver's license numbers,
2 waivers of their Constitutional right to have their land free from search without cause by the
3 County, and consent to a criminal background check. If a Ban Ordinance was enacted, there was
4 no reasonable expectation that Petitioners would be required to expend substantial resources to
5 comply with the then non-existent Ban Ordinance without Due Process of law.

52. On January 10, 2018, the County's Board adopted the Ban Ordinance four months
after Petitioners obtained their licenses. The Ban Ordinance will terminate Petitioners licenses.

53. Petitioners are required to undertake nine onerous legislatively mandated
remediation measures until the County deems their properties suitable for subsequent use. The
101 Ban Ordinance's remediation mandates confer the County the right to control Petitioners
11 remediation efforts over their properties. Petitioners had no personal notice that such
12 Constitutional deprivation would occur as to them specifically, no opportunity to be heard or
13 present evidence as to their specific properties as to why such remediation is appropriate, or
14| otherwise be provided notice or heard regarding these remedial mandates.
15 54. The County's violation of Petitioners' Due Process Rights will cause Petitioners
16| substantial damages in an amount to proven at the time of trial.
17 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

18 WHEREFORE, Petitioners respectfully request that the Court enter judgment in their
19 favor as follows:

20| 1. For an Peremptory Writ of Mandate to be issued under Code of Civil Procedure
21 sections 1085 and 1094.5 ordering:

22 (a) The County, by and through the Board Supervisors, to immediately vacate
23  and set aside its approval of the Ban Ordinance;
24 (b) The County, by and through the Board Supervisors, to immediately vacate
25| and set aside its certification of the final EIR;

26 (c) The County, by through its Board Supervisors, to revise its draft EIR to
27 address of the potentially significant environmental impacts of the Ban Ordinance;
28 (d) The County, by and through its Board Supervisors to prepare and

in any subsequent action taken to approve the Ban Ordinance;

17.95.050 Remediation and Restoration of Former Cannabis Cultivation Sites

A. A "former cannabis cultivation site" for purposes of this section is that portion of a parcel on which cannabis cultivation or related activities have occurred within
twenty-four (24) months of the enactment date of this Chapter but no longer legally occurs, regardless of whether or not anyone is lawfully residing on the parcel and regardless of whether or not a previous cannabis cultivator retains physical or legal possession of the parcel.

B. The current legal owner(s) of a parcel containing a former cannabis cultivation site,
whether or not the site was registered under the County's prior medical cannabis
cultivation site registration system or had an "application pending" certificate, shall have a joint and several duty to take immediate steps to maintain the site in a
manner which prevents soil erosion and sediment run-off; visual blight; illegal diversion of water supply; contamination of soil; contamination of waters of the
State from soil additives such as soil and mulch, amendments, and fertilizers;
improper keeping, storage and/or disposal of rodenticides, fungicides, herbicides and pesticides; and improper keeping, generation, storage, or disposal of household waste, fuel and chemical containers, and/or other hazardous waste or materials
which may cause harm to public health or the environment.

C. The current owner(s) and former cultivator(s) of a parcel containing a former cannabis cultivation site shall additionally have a joint and several duty to take all of the following actions to remediate and restore the former cannabis cultivation site

within twenty-four (24) months of the effective date of the current version of this Chapter:

1. All preparation and/or development of the site for future cannabis
cultivation or related activities that are not permitted under this Chapter
shall cease, regardless of whether or not a grading permit, building permit, or
other similar permit has been issued for these activities.

2. To the extent an unexpired permit exists for earthmoving activity, water
diversion activity, waste discharge, timber harvesting, construction, or any other activity, and to the extent such unexpired permit imposes conditions for the site upon cessation of cannabis cultivation activity, these conditions shall be fully complied with.

3. To the extent that earthmoving activity, water diversion activity, timber
harvesting, construction, or any other activity occurred on the site which
requires a permit under local, state, or federal law, but for which a permit
was never applied for or received, a permit shall be applied for and received,
and its conditions shall be fully complied with, regardless of whether or not
the unpermitted activity has ceased.

4. All remediation and restoration activities shall be performed in compliance with all applicable local, state, and federal rules and regulations.
5. Best management practices shall be employed to control soil erosion and
protect water quality on the site.

6. Any unlawful diversion or use of water for cannabis cultivation on the site
shall cease, and both the site and the streambed(s) or waterway(s) impacted by the diversion shall be restored to their pre-diversion state in compliance
with all laws.

7. Soil and mulch, amendments, pesticides, herbicides, rodenticides, fungicides, fertilizers and other hazardous materials shall be properly
disposed of or stored as required by law.

8. All temporary structures placed on the site for purposes of cannabis
cultivation or related activities, including but not limited to hoop houses and
unpermitted greenhouses, recreational vehicles, outhouses, and
temporary fencing shall be removed and properly disposed of within 90
days of the effective date of this ordinance.

9. All waste, including but not limited to household, commercial, and agricultural waste, fuel and chemical containers, and any other hazardous waste shall be properly collected and removed from the site in accordance with all laws to
a prevent a nuisance and public health hazard.

These provisions do not require restoration of the site to its pre-cannabis cultivation
condition but require the site to be reclaimed pursuant to the above- stated
provisions to a condition that allows for suitable subsequent use of the property.

D. Any temporary permit issued pursuant to 17.95.165.N.14 of the version of this
Chapter adopted May 10, 2016 shall automatically terminate, and all removal of temporary facilities authorized by that permit shall be removed, within 90 days of the
effective date of this ordinance.

17.95.060 Enforcement; Fines; Liability to Pay Costs and Fines

A. To enforce the provisions of this Chapter, an Enforcement Official may, at a reasonable time, request inspection of any parcel known to be or suspected of
cultivating cannabis. If the person owning or occupying the parcel refuses the
request for an inspection, the Enforcement Official shall have recourse to pursue every remedy provided by law to secure entry, including but not limited to obtaining
an inspection warrant.
B. Whenever any Enforcement Official determines that a public nuisance as described in this Chapter exists within the unincorporated County, he or she is authorized to utilize the enforcement, abatement, cost recovery, and administrative hearing provisions described in Chapter 8.06 of the County Code, including, as necessary, the summary abatement provisions of that Chapter. The County shall also have the
right to utilize any injunction, enforcement, cost recovery, abatement or other administrative, criminal or civil remedy available to the County under applicable laws, including but not limited to the civil, criminal and administrative remedies

violation which persists for more than one day is deemed a continuing violation.
J. In addition to the actual abatement and/or administrative costs incurred by the
County in enforcing this Chapter, any person who has been issued a notice of violation and fails to abate such violation within the timeframes specified in the
notice, shall be assessed an administrative fine of one-thousand dollars
($1,000.00) per day. The administrative fine shall be assessed immediately upon the
expiration of the deadline specified in the notice of violation and shall continue to
accrue daily until the violation has been fully abated and verified by the Enforcement
Officer.

K. Any violation of this Chapter can be prosecuted as a misdemeanor.

L. A permittee shall provide to the planning director, upon request, written
evidence to the planning director's reasonable satisfaction, that the
permittee is not engaged in interstate commerce, as it relates to
cannabis.

SECTION 2: SEVERABILITY

If any part or subsection of this chapter is for any reason held to be invalid, unlawful, or
unconstitutional, such invalidity, unlawfulness, or unconstitutionality shall not affect the
validity, lawfulness, or constitutionality of any other part of this chapter.

SECTION 3: FINDINGS
The Board of Supervisors of the County of Calaveras finds and declares as follows:

A. The Federal Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. §§ 801 et seq., classifies cannabis (or marijuana) as a Schedule | Drug, which is defined as a drug or other substance that has a high potential for abuse, that has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and that has not been accepted as safe for use under medical supervision.

B. The Federal Controlled Substances Act makes it unlawful, under federal law, for any
person to cultivate, manufacture, distribute or dispense, or possess with intent to
manufacture, distribute or dispense, marijuana or cannabis. The Federal Controlled
Substances Act contains no exemption for the cultivation, manufacture,
distribution, dispensation, or possession of marijuana or cannabis for medical or
recreational purposes.

C. On October 19, 2009, then-Attorney General David W. Ogden issued a
memorandum directing federal prosecutors in states with medical cannabis
regulations to deprioritize the prosecution of compliant businesses and individuals.
Substantively similar memoranda were subsequently issued by then- Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole and became known collectively as "the Cole memos". The
Cole memo, while not providing a defense against potential federal enforcement,
professed tolerance of state schemes to regulate medical cannabis so long as they
were sufficiently stringent to protect against the types of cannabis-related activity
deemed a priority by the federal government. To date, the Cole memos have not
been rescinded or replaced.

D. On December 16, 2014, then-President Barack H. Obama signed the Consolidated
and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2015, containing language known as the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment, which prohibits the expenditure of federal funds to
prosecute cases against medical cannabis patients and providers, including
businesses, in states where medical cannabis use is legal. The Rohrabacher-Farr
Amendment has been repeatedly renewed and extended by both the former and current administrations and was extended most recently on December 22, 2017. There are, to
date, no federal policies protecting against federal enforcement of the Controlled
Substances Act in the recreational cannabis context.

E. In 1996, the voters of the State of California approved Proposition 215, "The Compassionate Use Act", (codified as Health and Safety Code Section 11362.5), which was intended to decriminalize cultivation and possession of medical cannabis by a seriously ill patient, or the patient's primary caregiver, for the patient's personal use, and to create a limited defense to the crimes of possessing or cultivating cannabis. The Act further provided that nothing in it shall be construed to supersede legislation prohibiting persons from engaging in conduct that endangers others, or to condone the diversion of cannabis for non- medical purposes.

F. The State enacted SB 420 in 2004 (known as the "Medical Marijuana Program Act",
codified as Health and Safety Code Section 11362.7 et seq.) to expand and clarify the
scope of The Compassionate Use Act of 1996 by creating the Medical Marijuana

Identification Card program, creating reasonable regulations for cultivating,
processing, transporting and administering cannabis, as well as limiting the amount of
cannabis a qualified individual may possess.

G. Health & Safety Code §11362.7 a defines a "primary caregiver" as an individual who is designated by a qualified patient or by a person with an identification card, and who
has consistently assumed responsibility for the housing, health, or safety of that patient or person and is further defined in the California Supreme Court decision
People v. Mentch (2008) 45 Cal.4th 274,

H. The State enacted the Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act (MMRSA) on
September 11, 2015 (SB 643, AB 266, and AB 243), instituting a comprehensive
state-level licensure and regulatory scheme for cultivation, manufacturing,
distribution, transportation, laboratory testing, and dispensing of medical cannabis
through numerous changes and additions to the Business & Professions Code and
the Health and Safety Code. MMRSA legalized and regulated for-profit
commercial activity related to medical cannabis in California. MMRSA has been
subsequently amended and renamed the Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety
Act (MCRSA).

I. While, prior to May 10, 2016, Calaveras County had never adopted a local
ordinance allowing or regulating cannabis cultivation within the County (or other
cannabis activities aside from medical cannabis dispensaries), there had been for
many years several hundred unregulated cannabis cultivation sites within the County. While these cultivation sites were unlawful under principles of permissive zoning
and County Code 17.04.010, some growers have argued they were legal because
they were not expressly banned. The adoption of this ordinance will serve to clarify
which cannabis cultivation activities the County expressly intends to allow and which
ones it expressly intends to prohibit.
J When MMRSA was originally enacted on January 1, 2016, it contained a provision
requiring local governments to either adopt a local regulatory scheme for medical cannabis activities by March 1, 2016 or the State would become "the sole licensing
authority" for these activities.

K. Throughout the State of California, many cities and counties, including cities and
counties surrounding Calaveras County, quickly adopted local urgency ordinances banning or severely restricting medical cannabis activities within their boundaries.

L. On February 3, 2016, the Governor of California signed Assembly Bill 21, removing the March 1st deadline for counties and cities to develop their own regulatory
schemes.

M. On February 16, 2016, the Board of Supervisors, at an open public meeting, directed the County Counsel's Office to draft an ordinance allowing but regulating medical cannabis cultivation and commercial uses involving medical cannabis within the jurisdictional boundaries of Calaveras County. This ordinance required the preparation of a programmatic environmental impact report before it could be adopted

and implemented, and this process had the potential to take more than a year to
complete.

N. Meanwhile, in the wake of the Board of Supervisor's February 16, 2016 directive to
prepare an ordinance allowing medical cannabis cultivation, Calaveras County experienced a marked influx of people who were escaping the new regulatory bans of medical cannabis cultivation in neighboring jurisdictions, purchasing and leasing
real estate within the County, and seeking to use these properties to cultivate
medical cannabis in anticipation of the County's new ordinance. There had also
been a steep rise in land speculation by existing local growers who were buying
inexpensive properties affected by the Butte Fire and seeking to move or expand
their cultivation sites beyond the ones they have already created. There was a concern that these trends were contributing to an unstudied, unregulated, and
potentially significant impact on the environment.

O Meanwhile, the County's geographic and climatic conditions, which include dense
forested areas with adequate precipitation and mild winters, provide conditions that are favorable to outdoor cannabis cultivation, allowing growers to achieve a high per- plant yield.

P. As a means of mitigating the impact of the influx of growers pending final adoption of
an Environmental Impact Report on the proposed permanent regulatory scheme for cannabis cultivation and commerce, the Board of Supervisors, on May 10, 2016, adopted an interim urgency ordinance authorizing temporary fee-based registrations for existing cannabis cultivation sites and requiring strict compliance
with local and state laws designed to protect the public and the environment
until a permanent ordinance was adopted. The applications were lengthy in order to capture the extensive compliance criteria, and the processing of each application
was, as a result, highly labor-intensive.

Q. As a result of 1) most neighboring jurisdictions having continued to ban or severely restrict commercial cannabis cultivation, 2) a sustained unusual availability of
inexpensive land for sale that was suitable for cannabis cultivation, and 3) the
approximately three-month gap between the day the regulatory scheme was publicly
announced and the May 10, 2016 cut-off date for having a prepared cultivation site
that could qualify for registration under it, the influx into the county of new growers
continued, and approximately three times the expected number of registration
applications were submitted to the Planning Department. Fewer than 300 were
expected, but approximately 900 were received.

R. Almost half of the registration applications thus far processed by the Planning
Department have resulted in a denial of the application after further investigation revealed disqualifying circumstances concerning the site or the grower. Thus, the
imposition of strict regulations and a three-month timeframe to comply did not
adequately disincentivize unqualified cannabis cultivators from paying the
registration fee and gambling that their disqualifying conditions would remain
unnoticed. The unexpected influx of additional growers, which included an influx of

unqualified growers, has been correlated with an increase in cannabis-related • crime,
including but not limited to robbery, assault, and murder.

S. This unexpected number of registration applications, some legitimate and some not, overwhelmed the County's ability to quickly process the applications to determine if the
sites met all of the qualification criteria of the urgency ordinance. The application burden far outpaced the ability of the Planning Department, Code Enforcement, and the Sheriff's Department, even with additional proceeds from registration fees, to hire, train, and retain an adequate number of new staff members to review applications, conduct background checks and inspect proposed sites while also continuing their other day-to-day duties.

T. A significant number of registration applications for the 2016 cultivation season remain unprocessed a to date, and now a second cannabis harvest has concluded.
U. The knowledge that County staff is overwhelmed by the application burden will likely
incentivize those whose sites or whose criminal background do not qualify for registration, but whose applications have not yet been processed, to continue growing
cannabis despite having substandard sites or disqualifying circumstances that would
negate the protections intended by the urgency ordinance.

V. On November 8, 2016, the voters of California adopted Proposition 64, "The
Control, Regulate and Tax Adult Use of Marijuana Act" (AUMA), which requires local jurisdictions to allow its residents to cultivate up to six cannabis plants indoors
non-commercially for recreational use. AUMA retained the right of local jurisdictions to impose reasonable regulations on recreational cultivation and imposes a
comprehensive statewide regulatory scheme on recreational cannabis use and
commerce.

W. On November 8. 2016 the voters of Calaveras County adopted a measure to tax commercial cannabis businesses within the County but rejected a voter initiative
seeking to establish a permanent regulatory ordinance that allowed more uses in more
zones than the existing urgency ordinance.

X. In January 2017, another County voter initiative, Measure B, qualified for the May 2017 ballot seeking to ban commercial cannabis within the County. The newly elected
Board of Supervisors called a special election to allow the people to vote on the
initiative.

Y. In February 2017, the Board of Supervisors directed staff to prepare a permanent
ordinance banning commercial cannabis cultivation and other commercial cannabis
uses within the County (other than medical cannabis dispensaries, which remain regulated under a separate chapter of the County Code). Meanwhile, the Board voted to extend the Urgency Ordinance as allowed by state law to provide the time required to a prepare and adopt a ban without existing regulations lapsing.

Z. On March 28, 2017, after a legal challenge was filed by a member of the public, the Calaveras County Superior Court ordered Measure B stricken from the ballot after finding some of its language to be impermissibly misleading,

AA. On June 27, 2017, the Medical and Adult Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (MAUCRSA) was enacted, intended to reconcile the differences between previously enacted state regulations. MAUCRSA was further amended on September 16, 2017. On November 16, 2017, the state adopted emergency regulations to implement MAUCRSA. Under the current state law cannabis regulatory scheme, counties are required to allow the indoor cultivation of at least six cannabis plants per residence, but counties are still permitted to impose regulations on this activity. BB. The rapid changes to cannabis-related state laws over the last two years; the concomitant transitioning of an illegal industry utilizing illegal cultivation and industry
practices to a legal industry adopting legal cultivation and industry practices; and the
uncertainty concerning federal enforcement policies, final state law requirements, and
the effectiveness of the state's implementation and enforcement of MAUCRSA further
justify the imposition of a ban on most commercial cannabis businesses within the
County.

CC. Children (minor under the age of 18) are particularly vulnerable to the effects of cannabis use and the presence of cannabis plants or products is an attractive nuisance for children, creating an unreasonable hazard in areas frequented by children (including schools, parks, and other similar locations). The cultivation of
cannabis, including non-commercial cannabis, at locations deemed "sensitive
uses" under Chapter 17.91 of the County Code creates unique risks that the cannabis plants may be observed by juveniles, and therefore, be especially
vulnerable to theft or recreational consumption by juveniles. Further, the potential
for criminal activities associated with the cultivation or distribution of cannabis in
the proximity of such locations poses heightened risks that juveniles will be involved
or endangered.

DD. The prohibition of commercial cannabis cultivation in the unincorporated area of
Calaveras County is necessary to protect the health, safety, and well-being of the County, its residents and its environment. Furthermore, comprehensive regulation of the premises used for non-commercial cannabis cultivation is necessary to protect the health, safety, and well-being of the County, its residents and environment by reducing risks associated with criminal activity, degradation of the natural
environment malodorous smells, and electrical fire hazards.

EE. As cannabis plants begin to flower, and for a period of approximately two months or more during the growing season, they produce an extremely strong odor that is offensive to many people and detectable well beyond property boundaries upon which they are grown. The strong odor of cannabis may create an attractive
nuisance, alerting individuals to the location of plants, thereby creating the risk of
potential crimes such as burglary, robbery, armed robbery, assault, attempted
murder, and murder.

FF. Comprehensive prohibition of commercial activities related to cannabis, including but not limited to the manufacture of cannabis products, distribution of cannabis, storage of cannabis, testing of cannabis, and commercial transport of cannabis, is proper to
address the risks and adverse impacts associated with such activities, which include

but are not limited to risks related to the concentration of large amounts of cannabis on a single premises, fire hazards, and toxin release hazards.
GG. Illegal, unregulated outdoor cannabis cultivation, especially within the
foothills, is negatively impacting California's surface and groundwater resources.
The State Water Resources Control Board, the North Coast Regional Water Quality
Control Board, the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board and the
Department of Fish and Wildlife have seen a dramatic increase in the number of
cannabis gardens, and corresponding increases in impacts to water supply and
water quality, including the discharge of sediments, pesticides, fertilizers, petroleum
hydrocarbons, trash and human waste. The sources of these impacts result from
unpermitted and unregulated timber clearing, road development, stream diversion for
irrigation, land grading, erosion of disturbed surfaces and stream banks, and
temporary human occupancy without proper sanitary facilities. Express prohibition of
outdoor cannabis cultivation is necessary to reduce the risks of these impacts.

HH. Il. The unregulated indoor cultivation of substantial amounts of cannabis poses
potential health and safety risks to those living in the residence, especially to children, and includes the increased risks of fire from grow light systems, exposure to fertilizers, pesticides, anti-fungus/mold agents, and exposure to potential property
crimes targeting the residence.

Il. The Federal Drug Enforcement Administration reports that various types of cannabis plants under certain planting conditions may yield an average of between ½ pound to nearly 2 pounds of cannabis. The Northern California Regional Intelligence Center estimates the "street value" of domestically produced high-grade cannabis sold illegally in California at $200-$2500 per pound, and an informal survey by the Sheriff's Department of cannabis dispensary prices in Northern California revealed retail prices ranging between roughly $2000 per pound to roughly $6000 per pound.

JJ. Large-scale unregulated cannabis cultivation has attracted crime and associated
violence in this and other counties, and grows may involve armed guards and/or
booby traps that threaten severe bodily harm or death to anyone who attempts to access the area of the grow. In 2011, there was an armed robbery and murder associated with an illegal grow in Amador County, and a robbery aftempt in this
County resulted in the shooting deaths of three men in late 2015.
KK. Calaveras County has a compelling interest in protecting the public health, safety, and welfare of its residents and businesses, in protecting the local environment and
local resources, in preserving the peace and quiet of the neighborhoods in which
large-scale cannabis cultivation operations• may exist, and in providing access to
cannabis for ill residents.

LL. The immunities from certain prosecution provided to qualified patients, their primary
caregivers, and medical and recreational users under State law to cultivate cannabis
plants does not confer the right to create or maintain a public nuisance. By adopting
the regulations contained in this Chapter, the County is hoping to minimize the risks
of and complaints regarding fire, odor, crime, environmental degradation, and

pollution caused or threatened by the unregulated cultivation of cannabis in the
unincorporated area of Calaveras County.

MM. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to allow the cultivation, distribution, or
consumption of cannabis that is otherwise illegal under State law; to allow the diversion
of medical cannabis into the non-medical market; or to allow the diversion of any cannabis into interstate commerce. No provision of this Chapter shall be deemed a defense or immunity to any action brought against any person by the County of
Calaveras, Calaveras County District Attorney, the Attorney General of the State of
California, or the United States of America.

NN. In Browne v. County of Tehama, 213 Cal. App. 4th 704 (2013), the California Court of Appeal stated that "Neither the Compassionate Use Act nor the Medical Cannabis Program grants...anyone.an unfettered right to cultivate cannabis for
medical purposes. Accordingly, the regulation of cultivation of medical cannabis does
not conflict with either statute." Similarly, in City of Riverside v. Inland Empire
Patients_Health & Wellness Center,_Inc., 56 Cal. 4th 729 (2013), the California
Supreme Court concurred that "Nothing in the CUA or the MMPA expressly or impliedly limits the inherent authority of a local jurisdiction, by its own ordinances, to regulate the use of its land..." Additionally, in Maral v. City of Live Oak (2013), 221
Cal.App. 4th 975, 983 (review denied), the same Court of Appeal held that "there is no right-and certainly no constitutional right-to cultivate medical cannabis..." The Court in Live Oak_affirmed the ability of a local governmental entity to prohibit the
cultivation of cannabis under its land use authority. These cases have not been overruled by the state's adoption of its new regulatory scheme.
OO. California Business and Professions Code §26200 expressly states that the division
added to the Business and Professions Code pursuant to MAUCRSA "shall not be
interpreted to supersede or limit the authority of a local jurisdiction to...completely prohibit the establishment or operation" of a commercial businesses licensed under MAUCRSA or to "supersede or limit existing local authority for law enforcement activity, enforcement of local zoning requirements or local ordinances, or
enforcement of local license, permit, or other authorization requirements".
PP. California Business and Professions® Code §26200 expressly states, "This division,
or any regulations promulgated there under, shall not be deemed to limit the authority
or remedies of a city, county, or city and county under any provision of law, including,
but not limited to, Section 7 of Article XI of the California Constitution."

QQ. While • California Health and Safety Code §11362.777 declares cannabis cultivation an "agricultural product" for purposes of the Department of Food and Agriculture's Medical Cannabis Cultivation Program and MCRSA, it also expressly
prohibits cannabis cultivation statewide in the absence of "a license, permit, or
other entitlement, specifically permitting cultivation pursuant to these provisions,
from the city, county, or city and county in which the cultivation will occur". State
law regulates cannabis differently than it does other agricultural products, and it
allows counties to do the same.

SECTION 4: CEQA FINDINGS
The Board of Supervisors of the County of Calaveras certifies that the Environmental Impact Report prepared for this ordinance has been completed in compliance with CEQA, that the Final Environmental Impact Report was presented to the Board of Supervisors and the Board of Supervisors has reviewed and considered the information contained in the Final EIR, and that the Final EIR reflects the County's independent judgment. Further, the Board of Supervisors hereby adopts the Findings of Fact, which are attached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated by reference.
SECTION 5: This ordinance, or a summary thereof including the vote of each Board member, shall be published within fifteen days after the date hereof in a newspaper of general circulation printed and published in the County of Calaveras, State of California, and shall become effective thirty days after the date hereof.
The foregoing ordinance was duly passed and adopted by the Board of Supervisors of the County of Calaveras at a regular meeting thereof, held on the 10th day of January, 2018, by the following vote:

ATTACHMENT A
CALAVERAS COUNTY BAN ON COMMERCIAL CANNABIS
OPERATIONS FINDINGS OF FACT
I. INTRODUCTION

The Calaveras County Board of Supervisors (Board), in the exercise of its independent judgment, makes and adopts the following findings regarding the Calaveras County Ban on
Commercial Cannabis Operations (the Ban Ordinance) in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.) (CEQA) and the CEQA Guidelines (Cal. Code Regs., Tit. 14, § 15000 et seq.).
II. STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS FOR FINDINGS
Public Resources Code section 21002 provides that "public agencies should not approve projects as proposed if there are feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures available which would substantially lessen the significant environmental effects of such projects[.J" The same section provides that the procedures required by CEQA "are intended to assist public agencies in systematically identifying both the significant effects of projects and the feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures which will avoid or substantially lessen such significant effects." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21002.) Section 21002 goes on to provide that "in the event [that] specific economic, social, or other conditions make infeasible such project alternatives or such mitigation measures, individual projects may be approved in spite of one
or more significant effects thereof:"
The mandate and principles announced in Public Resources Code section 21002 are
implemented, in part, through the requirement that agencies must adopt findings before approving projects for which EIRs are required. (See Pub. Resources Code, §21081, subd. (a);

CEQA Guidelines, §15091, subd. (a).) For each significant environmental effect identified in
an EIR for a project, the approving agency must issue a written finding reaching one or more
of three permissible conclusions:

(1) Changes or alterations have been required in, or incorporated into, the project which
avoid or substantially lessen the significant environmental effect as identified in the
final EIR.

(2) Such changes or alterations are within the responsibility and jurisdiction of another public agency and not the agency making the finding. Such changes have been adopted by such other agency or can and should be adopted by such other agency.
(3) Specific cconomic, legal, social, technological, or other considerations, including provision of employment opportunities for highly trained workers, make infeasible the mitigation measures or project alternatives identified in the final EIR.
(CEQA Guidelines, § 15091, subd. (a); Pub. Resources Code, § 21081, subd. (a).) Public Resources Code section 21061.1 defines "feasible" to mean "capable of being accomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable period of time, taking into account economic,
environmental, social, legal, and technological factors." (See also Citizens of Goleta Valley v.
Bd. of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 565.)
With respect to a project for which significant impacts are not avoided or substantially lessened, a public agency, after adopting proper findings, may nevertheless approve the project if the agency first adopts a Statement of Overriding Considerations setting forth the specific reasons why the agency found that the project's "benefits" rendered "acceptable" its "unavoidable adverse environmental effects." (CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15093, 15043, subd. (b);
see also Pub.
Resources Code, §21081, subd. (b).)
Here, as explained below and in the Final EIR, the Ban Ordinance would not result in any
significant environmental effects. Since there are no significant environmental effects, the
Board is not required to consider any mitigation measures or alternatives, and CEQA does not
require the Board to make any specific findings. Nevertheless, the Board issues these findings to document its independent judgment regarding the potential environmental effects analyzed in the Final EIR and to document its reasoning for approving the Ban Ordnance.

III. PROJECT BACKGROUND

Unregulated cannabis cultivation and related activities have been occurring in Calaveras County for decades. Even prior to the state's adoption of the Medical Marijuana Regulatory and Safety Act (MMRSA) in September, 2015, the Board and County staff were working to
develop an ordinance to regulate the cultivation of medical cannabis, but, for a time, were a unable to establish clear policy guidance.
In early 2016, the Board directed County staff to prepare an ordinance that would regulate
medical cannabis in the County. A draft regulatory ordinance was prepared and reviewed by the Board in February, 2016, and the County determined that an EIR would be necessary under

CEQA. The originally-proposed regulatory ordinance included measures that would establish land use regulations for the cultivation, manufacture, testing, distribution, and storage of medical marijuana within the County. A Notice of Preparation (NOP), the first step in preparing the EIR, was published by staff on April 5, 2016,
On May 10, 2016, the Board adopted an urgency ordinance---the Urgency Ordinance Regulating Medical Cannabis Cultivation and Commercial Uses Involving Medical Cannabis. The purpose of the urgency ordinance was to quickly establish land use regulations concerning
the cultivation, manufacture, testing, distribution, transportation, and storage of medical marijuana in the County. Adoption of the urgency ordinance was considered necessary to address conditions that were creating public nuisances related to location, types, and size of marijuana cultivation sites and commercial activities. Specifically, the urgency ordinance addressed the proximity of marijuana plants and products near schools, degradation of the natural environment, malodorous
smells, and indoor electrical fire hazards. Without further action by the Board, the urgency ordinance would have expired by its terms in February 2018.
In November 2016, California voters passed Proposition 64, the Adult Use of Marijuana Act (AUMA), an initiative that legalized recreational use of cannabis and limited the extent to which
local jurisdictions could restrict cultivation for personal use. This complicated the County's regulatory scheme since the urgency ordinance only dealt with medical cannabis, not
recreational cannabis.

In the meantime, in observation that cannabis cultivation was continuing to proliferate in the state, the County continued to consider its options for regulating cannabis. After new members were clected to the Board in November, 2016, the Board directed staff to prepare an ordinance that would ban cannabis cultivation and associated commercial activities in the County. A draft
of the Ban Ordinance was prepared and posted on the Planning Department's website on April 27, 2017. The Ban Ordinance was also included in the Draft EIR and analyzed as an alternative to the originally-proposed regulatory ordinance. Because the Ban Ordinance will preclude legal cannabis-related development and its associated physical environmental impacts, it was considered a reasonable alternative to reduce the potential physical environmental impacts associated with implementation of the originally-proposed ordinance. The Draft EIR. explained that it was intended to serve as the environmental clearance document necessary for the Board's approval of either the originally-proposed regulatory ordinance or the Ban Ordinance.
The state legislature subsequently approved Senate Bill 94, known as the Medical and Adult Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (MAUCRSA) which implemented Prop. 64 and significantly modified MCRSA with respect to both commercial cannabis regulation in general and to the addition of recreational use. This was signed into law by the Governor on June 27,
2017, and the Ban Ordinance was modified to conform to the new requirements.
Numerous other jurisdictions in California have considered or are considering similar bans on cannabis-related operations to the extent allowable under state law.

IV. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION

A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES

Recognizing the requirements of state and federal law related to the use and distribution of
cannabis, the primary objectives of the Ban Ordinance include the following:
1. Comprehensively regulate premises within the County used for marijuana cultivation or commercial activities related to marijuana or to prohibit those uses within the constraints of state law.

2. Maintain the health, safety, and well-being of the County, its residents, and environment.

3. Minimize risks of and complaints regarding fire, odor, and pollution caused by unregulated cultivation of marijuana within the County.

4. Protect the County's surface and groundwater resources by reducing the discharge of sediments, pesticides, fertilizers, petroleum hydrocarbons, trash, and human
waste.

B. PROJECT LOCATION
Calaveras County is located in California's central Sierra Nevada region, ranging from low- elevation oak-covered foothills to high-elevation pine forests. The Mokelumne, Stanislaus and Calaveras rivers flow through the County collecting water from rain and melting snow to fill
the County's numerous lakes and reservoirs. The majority of land within the County falls
within the regulatory jurisdiction of the County, with the exception of the City of Angels Camp, the only incorporated city within the county boundaries, and federal and state lands (approximate 13 percent of the land area of the County). Approximately 39,000 acres within the County are owned by the Bureau of Land Management with an additional 6,000 acres, associated with the Calaveras Big Trees State Park, owned by the State of California. The Ban Ordinance will apply countywide.
C. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Ban Ordinance is an amendment to Chapter 17.95 of the Calaveras County Code that, once in effect, will ban the cultivation of, and other commercial activities related to, cannabis
within the County to the extent allowable under state law. The Ordinance contains six
sections: a purpose and intent statement, definitions, provisions describing the relationship to other laws, a declaration that cultivation and all commercial activities relating to cannabis (except dispensaries and the minimum non-commercial cultivation protected under state law) are a nuisance and therefore prohibited, provisions for remediation of cultivation sites, and
enforcement provisions.
With the adoption of the Ban Ordinance, the County will implement a ban on commercial cannabis operations and cannabis cultivation, in general, except for up to six indoor cannabis plants (regardless of whether they are cultivated for medical or recreational use or both). Per Proposition 64, as approved on November 8, 2016 by California voters (California Health and Safety Code section 11362.2, subdivision (b)(2)), the County may not completely prohibit residents from growing marijuana indoors and must allow residents the ability to cultivate up
to six indoor plants (although reasonable regulations can be imposed).

Under the Ban Ordinance, no new commercial cannabis cultivation, processing, or distribution facilities will be allowed within the County. The Ban Ordinance will also require the cessation
of commercial cannabis operations currently allowed under the County's urgency ordinance
and will require the restoration of existing sites. Steps must be taken to prevent erosion and
run-off, properly dispose of or store agricultural chemicals, fuels, and other substances that
could be considered hazardous, and remove any temporary or unauthorized structures. The
responsibility, including all expenditures, for restoration, will be borne by the individual
property owners.

V. ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS
In accordance with Public Resources Code section 21092 and CEQA Guidelines section 15082, the County issued a notice of preparation (NOP) on April 7, 2016, to inform agencies and the general public that an EIR was being prepared and to invite comments on the scope and content of the document. The NOP was submitted to the State Clearinghouse; posted on the County's website (http://planning.calaverasgov.us); posted with the Calaveras County Clerk; and made available at the Calaveras County Planning Department as well as the San Andreas Central Library, In addition, the NOP was distributed directly to public agencies (including potential responsible and trustee agencies), interested parties, and individuals who
had previously requested such notices. Finally, a press release was issued by the County on April 5, 2016. The NOP was circulated through May 6, 2016, for a 30-day review period.
In accordance with Public Recourses Code section 21083.9 and CEQA Guidelines section
15082(c), a noticed scoping meeting for the EIR occurred on July 20, 2016, at the Calaveras
County Board of Supervisors Chambers in San Andreas, California.
On May 1, 2017, a Draft EIR was released for a 45-day public review and comment period
that ended on June 14, 2017.
The Draft EIR identified the Medical Cannabis Cultivation and Commerce Ordinance
(regulatory ordinance) as the "proposed project." At the direction of the Board, the Ban Ordinance was included in the Draft EIR and analyzed as an alternative to the proposed
project. The Draft EIR explained that the Board directed County Counsel and the County
Planning Department to prepare an ordinance banning the cultivation and other commercial activities related to cannabis to the extent allowable under state law and that the Draft EIR
could serve as the appropriate CEQA document for adoption of the Ban Ordinance. The Draft
EIR analyzed the potential environmental impacts of both the initially proposed regulatory ordinance and the Ban Ordnance, as well as two other alternatives. The level of impact varied by alternative, with only the Ban Ordnance having no impacts or less than significant
impacts. Accordingly, the Ban Ordinance was identified as the "environmentally superior
alternative."

The DEIR was submitted to the. State Clearinghouse; posted on the County's website (http://planning.calaverasgov.us);posted with the Calaveras County Clerk; and made available at the Calaveras County Planning Department as well as the San Andreas Central Library, A notice of availability was distributed by the County to the Calaveras Enterprise and a project-
specific mailing list.

The County held a public hearing on May 22, 2017, to receive input from agencies and the public on the Draft EIR. The hearing was held at the Calaveras County Board of Supervisors Chambers in San Andreas, California.
The County issued a Final EIR on September 5, 2017. The Final EIR includes the written and
verbal comments that the County received from agencies, organizations, and individuals on the content of the Draft EIR, and responses to those comments. The Final EIR also includes minor
revisions and clarifications, including an additional alternative and mitigation measure that were proposed during the comment period.
The Calaveras County Planning Commission held a public hearing on September 28, 2017, to consider a recommendation to the Board of Supervisors. The Planning Commission voted to recommend that the Board consider both the Ban Ordinance and a strict regulatory ordinance that would impose greater restrictions on cannabis cultivation than allowed under the
originally- proposed regulatory ordinance.

VI. RECIRCULATION
Under CEQA Guidelines section 15088.5, recirculation of an EIR is required when "significant new information" is added to the EIR after public notice is given of the availability of the Draft EIR for public review but prior to certification of the Final EIR. The term "information" can
include changes in the project or environmental setting, as well as additional data or other information. New information added to an EIR is not "significant," however, unless the EIR is changed in a way that deprives the public of a meaningful opportunity to comment upon a substantial adverse environmental effect of the project or a feasible way to mitigate or avoid such an effect (including a feasible project alternative) that the project's proponents have declined to implement. "Significant new information" requiring recirculation includes, for example, a disclosure showing that:
(1) A new significant environmental impact would result from the project or from a
new mitigation measure proposed to be implemented.

(2) A substantial increase in the severity of an environmental impact would result unless mitigation measures are adopted that reduce the impact to a level of insignificance.

(3) A feasible project alternative or mitigation measure considerably different from others previously analyzed would clearly lessen the significant environmental impacts of the project, but the project's proponents decline to adopt it.
(4) The DEIR was so fundamentally and basically inadequate and conclusory in nature
that meaningful public review and comment were precluded.
(CEQA Guidelines, § 15088.5, subd. (a).)
Recirculation is not required where the new information added to the EIR merely clarifies or amplifies or makes insignificant modifications in an adequate EIR. The above standard is "not intend[ed] to promote endless rounds of revision and recirculation of EIRs." (Laurel Heights

Improvement Assn. V, Regents of the Univ. of Cal. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 1112, 1132.) "Recirculation was intended to be an exception, rather than the general rule." (lbid.)
The Final EIR includes minor changes and revisions to the Draft EIR, including the addition of
a new alternative--Alternative 4--that was suggested during the public comment period. That alternative, however, is not considerably different from the others previously analyzed and would not clearly lessen the significant environmental impacts of either the originally- proposed regulatory ordinance or the Ban Ordinance. Alternative 4 is similar to Alternative 3, with minor differences mainly related to setbacks and restricting such activities to larger parcels. Alternative
4 would result in similar environmental impacts as Alternative 3, which was analyzed in the DEIR. Moreover, Alternative 4 would result in greater impacts than the Ban Ordnance approved by the Board, which was also analyzed in the Draft EIR. Accordingly, including Alternative 4 in the Final EIR did not require recirculation. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15088.5, subd. (a)(3); see also South County Citizens for Smart Growth v. County of Nevada (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 316, 330- 331.)
The Board finds that none of the changes and revisions in the Final EIR substantially affects the analysis or conclusions presented in the Draft EIR. Therefore, recirculation of the Draft EIR for additional public comments is not required. (CFQA Guidelines, § 15088.5, subd. (a).)

VII. RECORD OF PROCEEDINGS

VIII. FINDINGS FOR IMPACTS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN SIGNIFICANT OR NO IMPACT WITHOUT IMPLEMENTATION OF MITIGATION MEASURES
The Board has reviewed and considered the information in the Draft EIR and the Final EIR, addressing potential environmental effects, as well as the proposed mitigation measures, and alternati ves.

As explained in the Draft EIR and Final EIR, the analysis of the Ban Ordinance assumes full compliance with the terms of the Ordinance. As explained in the Final EIR, it is generally appropriate under CEQA to presume that a project will be implemented as proposed, that applicable regulations will be followed, and that applicants will operate their project legally. During the public comment period, however, some commenters claimed that the EIR should have assumed instead that people would not comply with the ordinance and that the EIR should have analyzed and quantified the environmental impacts that could potentially occur as a result of non-compliant, illegal cannabis operations that might occur in spite of the ban. That type of speculation, however, is not required under CEQA, and in fact, would be impossible. As acknowledged in the EIR, illegal cannabis activities are already occurring under existing "baseline" conditions and even if such activities were to continue after the Ban
Ordinance is implemented, those activities would not result in additional environmental impacts over baseline conditions. Moreover, the degree to which illegal activities might increase under the Ban Ordinance is entirely speculative since such activities would be expressly prohibited under the ordinance and any person who violates the ordinance is subject to penalties.
Nevertheless, the EIR's discussion of the Ban Ordinance acknowledges that illegal activities may persist to some degree in spite of the ban and generally discusses potential impacts related to that type of activity. It would have been too speculative, however, to assign significance determinations for those types of impacts (e.g., impacts that may result from illegal activities and non-compliance with the Ban Ordinance). Accordingly, the Board finds that the analysis of

the Ban Ordinance in the EIR is reasonable and includes sufficient information to allow the Board to make a fully informed decision. Further, the Board finds that there are no feasible mitigation measures available that would reduce the potential environmental impacts caused by illegal cannabis activities if such activities were to occur in spite of the ban. The Board, relying on the facts and analysis in the Draft EIR and Final EIR, which were presented to the Board and reviewed and considered prior to any approvals, concurs with the conclusions of the Draft EIR and Final EIR regarding the potential environmental effects of the Ban Ordinance.

The Board concurs with the conclusions in the Final EIR that the Ban Ordinance has no potential for significant environmental effects on the following resource categories: Agriculture and Forestry Resources; Geology and Soils; Hazards and Hazardous Materials; Mineral Resources; Public Services; Recreation; and Utilities and Service Systems.
The Board also concurs with the conclusions in the Final EIR that all of the following impacts will be less than significant or no impact:
Aesthetics

Impact 3.1-1: Have a substantial adverse effect on a scenic vista or substantially damage scenic resources.
Impact 3.1-2: Substantially degrade the existing visual character or quality of the project
area.

IX. PROJECT ALTERNATIVES

CEQA Guidelines section 15126.6 states that an EIR "shall describe range of reasonable alternatives to the project, or to the location of the project, which would feasibly attain most of the basic objectives of the project but would avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant
effects of the project, and evaluate the comparative merits of the alternatives. An EIR need not consider every conceivable alternative to a project."
The Final EIR analyzed the originally-proposed regulatory ordinance plus four alternatives. In addition to the Ban Ordinance (which was identified as Alternative 2), the Final EIR analyzed the following three alternatives:

Alternative 1 - No Project, which assumes no change in the County Code and continuation of the existing zoning ordinance. This alternative also assumes that the urgency ordinance would not be extended into the future;
Alternative 3 - Reduced Zoning Designations Available for Commercial Cannabis
Operations, which assumes a reduction in the zoning designations that would allow commercial cannabis operations. Under this alternative, Rural Residential (RR) would be removed from consideration as an acceptable zone within which commercial cannabis operations could occur.
Alternative 4 - Minimum Parcel Sizes and Further Reduced Zoning Designations Available for Commercial Cannabis Operations, which included a further restriction on the zoning designations available for commercial cannabis cultivation and related activities and would also
establish minimum parcel sizes for many of the allowable zones.
The Board finds that the alternatives analyzed in the EIR represent a "reasonable range" of alternatives and that the EIR included sufficient analysis to allow for informed decision making. (See San Joaquin Raptor/Wildlife Rescue Center v. County of Stanislaus (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 713, 735 ["discussion of alternatives must be 'meaningful' and must 'contain analysis sufficient to allow informed decision making'].) It bears mentioning, moreover, that the fact that the Ban Ordinance was analyzed as an alternative in the EIR rather than the "proposed project" is not an infirmity under CEQA. CEQA does not constrain agencies to only adopt a project as originally proposed in a Draft EIR, but instead provides agencies with flexibility to adopt any alternative, or even just a portion of an alternative, to satisfy their environmental concerns. (Sierra Club v. City of Orange (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 523, 533; Dusek v. Redevelopment Agency (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 1029, 1041; CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15002, subd. (a), (h), 15021, subd. (a); see Sequoyah Hills Homeowners Assn. V. City of Oakland (1993) 23 Cal.App.4th 704, 713 [upholding agencies approval of an alternative rather than the proposed project].) In fact, CEQA specifically directs agencies to choose an
alternative that lessens the significant environmental impacts of a project, whenever feasible. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21002, 21081; CEQA Guidelines, § 15002, subd. (h).)
Because the Board has determined that the potential impacts of the Ban Ordinance are less than significant, the Board is not required to consider the feasibility of any project alternatives. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21002; Laurel Hills Homeowners Association v. City Council (1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 515, 521 (Laurel Hills); see also Kings County Farm Bureau v. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 730-731; and Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of the University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 400-403.)
The Board notes, however, that the environmental superiority of the Ban Ordinance is alone a sufficient reason to adopt the Ban Ordinance rather than the other alternatives analyzed in the EIR. As explained previously, the purpose of an EIR is to identify ways to avoid or mitigate the significant environmental impacts of proposed project. Here, the Final EIR analyzed the originally-proposed regulatory ordinance, the Ban Ordinance, as well as three other alternatives. The originally-proposed regulatory ordinance would result in numerous environmental impacts and, while most of those impacts could be reduced to a less-than- significant level with mitigation, the regulatory ordinance would result in traffic and odor impacts that would remain significant and unavoidable even with the mitigation measures identified in the EIR. While the other alternatives would reduce those impacts to some degree,

the Ban Ordinance is the only alternative that would not result in any significant impacts and would not require mitigation.

SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA
COUNTY OF CALAVERAS
ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR) INFORMATION

SUMMARY OF CONTENTS. This ADR information package contains (a) general information about the principal ADR processes, (b) information about ADR processes available at the court, and (o) an ADR stipulation form.
GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT ADR. Did you know that most civil lawsuits settle without a trial? And did you know that there are a number of ways to resolve civil disputes without having to sue somebody?
These alternatives to a lawsult are know as altemative dispute resolution (ADR).
The most common forms of ADR are mediation, arbitration, and case evaluation. There are a number of other kinds of ADR as well. In ADR, trained, Impartial persons decide disputes or help parties decide disputes themselves. These persons are called "neutrals." For example, in mediation, the neutral is the mediator. Neutrals normally are chosen by the disputing parties or by the court. Neutrais can help parties resolve disputes without having to go to court. ADR is not new. ADR is available in many communities, through dispute resolution programs and private neutrals.
Advantages of ADR.- ADR can have a number of advantages over a lawsuit.
• ADR cari be speedier. A dispute often can be resolved in a matter or months, even weeks, through ADR, while a lawsuit can take years. ADR can save money. Court costs, attorneys fees, and expert fees can be saved. ADR can permit more participation. The parties may have more chances to tell their side of the story than in court and may have more control over the outcome. ADR can be flexible. The parties can choose the ADR process that is best for them. For example, in mediation the parties may decide how to resolve their dispute. ADR can be cooperative. This means that the partles having a dispute may work together with the neutral to resoive the dispute and agree to a remedy that makes sense to them, rather than work against each other. ADR can reduce stress. There are fewer, if any, court appearances. And because ADR can be speedier, and save money, and because the parties are normally cooperative, ADR is easier on the nerves. The parties don't have a lawsuit hanging over their heads for years. ADR can be more satisfying. For all the above reasons, many people have a reported a high degree of satlsfaction with ADR.

Because of these advantages, may parties choose ADR to resolve a dispute, instead of filing a lawsult. Even when a lawsuit has been filed, the court may refer the dispute to a neutral before the parties' positions harden and the lawsuit becomes costly. ADR has been used to resolve disputes even after a trial, when the result is appealed.
Disadvantages of ADR -ADR may not be suitable for every dispute. If ADR is binding, the parties normally give up most court protections, including a decision by judge or jury under formal rules of evidence and procedure, and review for legal error by an appellate court. There generally is less opportunity to find out about the other side's case with ADR than with litigation. ADR may not be effective if it takes place before the parties have suffloient information to resolve the dispute.

CRC 1580(b) defines "general civil cases" as pot including family, juvenile, or probate code actions.

CRC 1580 et. seq. ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR) INFORMATION Page 1 of 3

The neutral may charge a fee for his or her services. If a dispute is not resolved through ADR, the parties may have to put time and money into both ADR and a lawsuit.
Lawsuits must be brought within specified periods of time, known as statutes of limitation. Parties must be careful not to let a statute of limitations run out while a dispute is in an ADR process.
Three common Types of ADR - Following are the three most common ADR methods.

1 Mediation. In mediation, a neutral (the mediator) assists the parties in reaching a mutually acceptable resolution of their dispute. Unlike lawsults or some other types of ADR, the mediator does not decide how the dispute is to be resolved. The parties do.
Mediation is a cooperative process, in which the parties work together toward a resolution that fries to meet everyone's interests, instead of working against each other, where at least one party loses. Mediation normally leads to better relations between the parties and to resolutions that hold up. For example, mediation has been very successful in family disputes, particularly with child custody and visitation.
Mediation is particularly effective when the parties have a continuing relationship, like neighbors or business people. Mediation also is very effeotive where personal feelings are getting in the way of a resolution. This is because mediation normally gives the parties a chance to let out their feelings and find out how each other sees things.
Mediation may not be a good idea when one party is unwilling to discuss a resolution or when one party has been a victim of the other or cannot have enough bargaining power in mediation, However, mediation can be successful for victims seeking restitution from offenders. A mediator can meet with the parties separately when there has been violence between them.
2. Arbitration. In arbitration, a neutral (the arbitrator) reviews evidence, hears arguments, and makes a dedision (award) to resolve the dispute. This is very different from mediation, where the mediator helps the parties reach their own resolution. Arbitration normally ls more informal and much speedier and less expensive than a lawsuit. Because of the large number or cases awaiting trial in many courts, a dispute normally can be heard much more quiokly by an arbitrator than by a judge. Often a case that may take a week to try in court can. be heard by an arbitrator in a matter or hours, because evidence can be submitted by documents (like medical reports and bills and business records), rather than by testimony.
There are two kinds of arbitration in California. Private arbitration, by agreement of the parties involved in the dispute, takes place outside of the courts and, normally, is binding. in most cases "binding" means that the arbitrator's decision (award) is final and there will not be a trail or an appeat of that decision. By contrast, a decision by an arbitrator in a case referred by the courts, known as "judicial arbitration," is not binding, unless the parties agree to be bound. A party who does not like the award may file a request for trial with the court within a specified time. However, if that party does not do better in the trial than in arbitration, he or she may have to pay a penalty.
Arbitration Is best for cases where the parties want a decision without the expense of a trial, Arbitration may be better than mediation when the parties have no relationship except for the dispute. Arbitration may not be a good idea when the parties want to resolve their dispute by themselves, or with the aid of a neutral.

3. Case Evaluation. In case evaluation, a neutral (the evaluator) gives an opinion on. the strengths and weaknesses of each party's evidence and arguments, and makes an evaluation of the case. Each party gets a chance to present their case and hear the other side. This may lead to settlement, or at lease help the parties prepare to resolve the dispute later on.
Case evaluation, like mediation, can come early In the dispute and save time and money. Case evaluation is most effective when someone has an unrealistic view of the dispute or when the only real issue is what the case is worth, or when there are technical or scientific questions to be worked out.

CRC 1580 et. seq. ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR) INFORMATION Page 2 of 3

• Case evaluation may not be a good idea when it is too soon to tell what the case is worth or when the dispute Is about something besides money, like a neighbor playing loud music late at night.
Additional Information - There are other types of ADR beside mediation, arbitration, and case evaluation. Some of these are conciliation, settlement conterences, fact finding, mini-trials, and summary jury trials. Sometimes parties will try a combination of ADR types. The important thing is to try to find the type or types of ADR that are most likely to resolve your dispute.
The selection of a neutral is an important decision. There is no legal requirement that the neutral be licensed or hold any particular certificate. However, some programs have established qualification requirements for neutrals. You may wish to inquire about the qualifications of any neutral you are using.
Two widely used ADR services are the American Arbitration Association (www.adr.org) 800/778-7879 and Judicial Arbitration / Mediation Services (www.lamsadr.com) 916/921-5300. Both services offer experienced neutrals, often. retired judges or attorney specialists, who can help you set up your ADR process, agree to common rules and proceed to solving or limiting a dispute.
Agreements reached through ADR normally are put in writing by the neutral and, if the parties wish, may become binding contracts than can be enforced by a judge. You may wish to seek the advice of any attorney as to your legal rights and other matters relating to the dispute.
COURT SUPERVISED ADR. Calaveras County Superior Court expects all attoreys and litigants to seriously consider and evaluate ADR options to be implemented In each case. The Court prefers that the parties choose the ADR process that best fits the particular needs and facts of a given dispute.(CCP § 1280 et. seq, CRC 1617) Absent agreement by the parties, the Court requires certain cases to participate in judicial arbitration.
Court Ordered Judicial Arbitration - For applicable cases, judicial arbitration will be required as follows: Cases may be ordered into arbitration with or without agreement of the parties.(CCP § 1141.11, CRC 1600) Unless named in the stipulation, 3 arbitrators will be selected by the court.(CRC 1605) Within 10 days from the date the arbitrators are selected by the court, each party (or side) may reject one of the 3 proposed arbitrators, and the court shall appoint one of the remaining proposed arbitrators.(CRC 1606) Within 15 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed by the court, the arbitrator shall notify the parties and the court of the date, time and place for the arbitration hearing.(CRC 1605) No private (Ex Parte) communications with the arbitrator are allowed except as necessary for scheduling or requesting a continuance. (CRC 1609) Parties that settle the case, must notify the arbitrator at least 2 days prior to the hearing.(CRC 1618) Parties with authority to settle are required to be present at the arbitration hearing. (CRC 1634) The arbitration hearing shall be completed within 90 days of the appointment of the arbitrator, requests for continuances to extend the 90 days, require a court order after noticed motion.(CRC 1607 & 1611) Within 10 days after the arbitration hearing, the arbitrator shall serve and file the award.(CRC 1615) The arbitration award shall be final and binding unless a party files a request for trial within 30 days after the date the arbitration award was filed.(CCP 1141.20, CRC 1616) If a timely request for trial is filed the case will be set on the case management calendar.(CCP § 1141.20) If the judgment upon trial is not more favorable than the arbitration award for the party who rejected the award and requested the trial, that party may be assessed with the other side's nonrefundable attorneys fees and costs.(CCP § 1141.21)
