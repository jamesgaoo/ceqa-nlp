VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 Petitioner and Plaintiff Vermont Entertainment Village, LLC ("Petitioner")

2 respectfully petitions this Court for a writ of mandate and for further relief against

3 Respondents County of Los Angeles and County of Los Angeles Board of Supervisors

4 (collectively "County"), and by this Verified Petition and Complaint alleges:
INTRODUCTION 5

6 1. This case pertains to the County's exercise of eminent domain against

7 property owners (Petitioner Vermont Entertainment Village, LLC ("Petitioner"), and

8 related entities) concerning approximately two blocks of land located in South Los Angeles
(sometimes the "Property"). The County purportedly seeks to build an approximately

10 four-acre, mixed-use project presently called the "Vermont and Manchester Transit

11
+09I-L0ll6 vo 'euepesed 8 SOAW HESARAY AR H E SILVERSTEIN LAW FIRM, Priority Joint Development Project" (the "County Project" or "Project"), based upon a

12 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") exemption for a "Sustainable

13 Communities Project" ("SCP"). The County illegally approved a CEQA exemption for the

14 County Project under Public Resources Code §§ 21155 and 21155.1, and without proper

15 CEQA environmental review of the Project's impacts, and without the required actions and

16 approvals by the City of Los Angeles, including under Government Code §§ 25351 and

17 65402 governing the acquisition of real property and/or approval of construction of
18 buildings for use by the County.
19 2. Petitioner and related entities spent years planning, assembling, and vetting

20 their own project, the Vermont Entertainment Village, to be built on the Property owned by

21 Petitioner and related entities (the "VEV Site" or "VEV Project") before the City of Los

22 Angeles, including through CEQA review and approval pursuant to an Environmental

23 Impact Report ("EIR"), which included a public comment period and enforceable
24  mitigation measures under CEQA. On the cusp of acquiring the final three of 16 parcels

25 for the VEV Project, and then after Petitioner had acquired those final three parcels, the

26 County fast-tracked the County Project, including through the improper use of a CEQA

27 exemption, and then by instigating eminent domain proceedings.

28
- 1-

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 3. The County Project would adversely impact an entire community by

2 displacing the VEV Project, which would create urgently needed jobs, services and tax

3 revenue for the community. The details of the VEV Project have been publicly vetted and

4 supported by the community. By contrast, up until approximately early December 2017,

5 the surrounding community had not even heard of the County's phantom project. Making

6 matters worse, the County is improperly claiming sovereign immunity from the City of Los

7 Angeles' building and safety and land use planning authority over the County Project,

8 which is located within incorporated areas of the County, i.e., within the boundaries of the
9 City of Los Angeles.

10 4. Petitioner challenges the legality of the County's December 5, 2017 hearing
DOA HIES PTARAY OGHRSRAL ARION WHId MYT NIEISHJATIS : S 11 and decisions to: (1) approve the amorphous and still-vaguely defined County Project; (2)
POSI-LOLL6 12 approve a CEQA exemption for the County Project; and (3) adopt a Resolution of

8 13 Necessity (sometimes hereinafter "RON") authorizing the use of eminent domain to take
Pasadena, 14 private properties for the County Project, based upon numerous illegal actions, including,

15 inter alia, the County's approval of the CEQA exemption as described in this Petition, the
16 County's approval of the Project in violation of the required notices and processes under
17 Government Code §§ 25351 and 65402, and the County's commencement of acquisition of
18 property in furtherance of the County Project in violation of Education Code § 17211. In

19 reliance on the illegal approval of the CEQA exemption, and in further violation of the
20 above-referenced Government and Education Code statutes, the County has illegally

21 proceeded with the County Project by filing an eminent domain action (LASC Case No.
22 BC686141).

23 5. On or about December 8, 2017, the County commenced an action in the Los

24 Angeles County Superior Court to take Petitioner's properties and the VEV Site by

25 eminent domain, County of Los Angeles v. 8400 S. Vermont Avenue, L.P., et al. (Case No.

26 BC 686141). Petitioner alleges that the County's decisions and actions to take the VEV

27 Site by eminent domain are nvalid and illegal because, in addition to other constitutional

28 and statutory violations, they violated CEQA by, inter alia:

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

Hi a. Providing an unfixed, unstable, and illegally expandable County
2 Project description, including illegal "piecemealing" of the County
m t o N Project, and actively precluding a realistic and accurate assessment of
the application of the CEQA SCP exemption to the Project;
b. Failing to provide adequate notice and a meaningful hearing, as
required by Pub. Res. Code § 21155.1(a); and

C. Failing properly to make and support findings required in order for

8 the County Project to be entitled to the SCP exemption,
9 6. Petitioner also alleges that the County violated Petitioner's due process and

10 fair hearing rights, including by actively preventing Petitioner from accessing information
OdV WHIH MYI NIELSUIATIS 3HI 11 regarding the County Project reasonably in advance of the December 5, 2017 County
91101-1504 J00f pig 'anuaAy oBUaJeW YuoN 9Iz 12 hearing, and by preventing Petitioner from having an adequate opportunity to be heard.

8 13 7. Petitioner further alleges that the proposed construction of the County
Pasadena, 14 Project, the County Project itself, and the County's prosecution of the eminent domain

15 action based on the County Project approvals, constitute an actual and/or threatened illegal,
16 wasteful and/or fraudulent expenditure of public funds by the County, and as a result, is a

17 violation of Code of Civil Procedure 526a, in addition to a violation of the common law

18 prohibition against government expenditures and actions that are fraudulent, collusive,

19 ultra vires, or that involve failure by the governmental body to perform a duty specifically

20 enjoined.

21 8. Petitioner also alleges that the County's approval of the RON, and all other

22 approvals related to the Project, including approval of a CEQA exemption, are further

23 illegal and void ab initio because the County failed to fulfill a condition precedent: the
24 County failed to obtain from the City of Los Angeles ("City") a waiver of the 60-day

25 notice requirements imposed by Gov't Code § 25351, subdivision (b), prior to the

26 approvals of the County Project at issue herein and prior to the County's attempted

27 acquisition of the VEV Site's real property by eminent domain. Petitioner also alleges that

28 the County illegally authorized the County Project in violation of and without first

3 fulfilling the submission and reporting requirements of Gov't Code § 65402. As such, the §

a and a failure to act in accordance with law.

8 mandate, ordering Respondents to set aside and void the challenged decisions of December

9 5, 2017, and to scrupulously carry out their duties under CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, due

10 process and fair administrative trial requirements, and all other applicable federal, state and
local laws, before making further decisions on the County Project (or on any alternative
project on any or all of the VEV Site).

16 013-002, and 6032-013-003, which the County seeks to take by eminent domain for the

17 alleged County Project. The County Project would occupy the parcels owned by Petitioner

18 and related entities. Petitioner and related entities that own other parcels within the VEV
Site are taxpayers in Los Angeles County.

Pasadena 14 FACTUAL, PROCEDURAL AND REGULATORY BACKGROUND

#% 15 The VEV Site/Petitioner's Project.
16 16. On or about December 8, 2017, the County commenced an action in the Los

17 Angeles County Superior Court to take Petitioner's properties and the VEV Site by

18 eminent domain, County of Los Angeles v. 8400 S. Vermont Avenue, L.P., et al. (Case No.

19 BC 686141). The County seeks to acquire by eminent domain fee simple title to sixteen
20 (16) largely contiguous assessor's parcels, located on or about the 8400 and 8500 blocks of

21 South Vermont Avenue, for construction and operation of the County Project.

22 17. In approximately 2014-2015, the VEV Project received land use

23 entitlements from the City of Los Angeles for the VEV Site, as well as full approval under

24 CEQA. Building plans were submitted to the City of Los Angeles, and the VEV Project

25 has garnered tremendous interest from national retailers and restaurants.

26 18. The VEV Project would provide goods and services in an area of the City of

27 Los Angeles desperately needing such uses, and would be the first retail development of its
28 kind in South Los Angeles since the 1992 civil disturbances.

4 and act as a catalytic generator for improving the overall economic health and vitality of

5 the area.

6 20. In 2017, the VEV Project was close to being construction-ready upon

7 acquisition of three (3) remaining parcels out of sixteen (16) parcels sought. After years of

8 work, millions of dollars spent, and approvals received, on or about November 15, 2017,

13 21. On or about August 15, 2017, the County sent to Petitioner a "Notice of 8
euapesed 14 Intent to Appraise" regarding the potential use of eminent domain to take private

4 15 properties, the majority of which were owned by Petitioner and/or related entities as part of

16 the VEV Project.

17 22. a At a time when Petitioner was on the cusp of finalizing its site assemblage,

18 which site assemblage has since been completed, the County's notice was the first time the

19 County threatened to exercise the power of eminent domain for an alleged "public use," or

20 that the County announced it even had a project that it apparently intended to pursue.

21 23. Although the County's August 15, 2017 notice referred generically to a

22 "public use," the notice did not describe or detail the alleged "public use" it intended for

23 the Project site.

24 24. On August 23, 2017, Petitioner sent a California Public Records Act

25 ("CPRA") request to the County to determine what the County Project entailed and to learn

26 what alleged "public use" was intended for the parcels sought to be taken by eminent

27 domain.

4 that any and all documents the County possessed about the alleged public use of and for

5 the County Project were privileged and exempt from disclosure.

26.

6 Petitioner alleges that the County illegally withheld those documents from

7 Petitioner at all times up to and through the County's December 5, 2017 hearing.

27.

8 On or about September 29, 2017, the County sent an offer under threat of
eminent domain to some of the entities related to Petitioner, but not to Petitioner, to

28.

19 On or about October 9, 2017, the County sent to the City of Los Angeles a
"Notice of Acquisition of Real Property Within City Limits; Request for Time
20 Waiver." The notice states the County "is preparing to construct the Manchester/Vermont

21

22 Development Project" ('Project") - describing a still vague and somewhat different project

23 from the description contained in the September 29, 2017 notice - stating that the Project

24 "generally consists of a transit-oriented boarding school, a multi-purpose community

25 space, a mixed-use commercial retail and affordable housing development, and 1 parking
structure. The Project also currently includes other community serving uses, such as a

26 publicly accessible open space/park, and a public transit plaza." (Emphasis added.) The

4 Resolution of Necessity to authorize use of eminent domain, and of the County's intent to

5 exempt the County Project from normal environmental review, both scheduled to occur on

6 November 21, 2017. The County Project was now referred to as the "Vermont/Manchester

19 community serving uses, such as a publicly accessible open space/park, and a public transit

21 down entirely the August 27, 2017 Public Records Act request, and stated the County

22 would not further consider it.

24 County asking for details about what exactly the County Project is, requesting public

25 records about the County Project and the County's actions, and seeking more time before

26 any hearing would be held.

27 32. On or about November 7, 2017, County counsel responded, claiming the

28 County had "complied with all statutory notice requirements." The County also enclosed

5 retail and affordable housing development, and a parking structure. The Project

6 also currently includes a publicly accessible open space/park, and the ability to improve

7 access to public transit services." (Emphasis added.) The County provided a two-week
8 continuance to December 5, 2017 for the hearing, but refused any further time extensions.

9 33. On or about November 9, 2017, counsel for Petitioner sent a letter to the
10 County again asking for details of what exactly the County Project is, requesting public
Floor 11 records about the Project and the County's actions, and seeking more time before any
POGL-LOWL SOO MS SNRO A North Marengo Avenue, 3 12 hearing would be held. Requests were made including for all County planning and related

8 13 files, the draft Resolution of Necessity, and the environmental report on the exemption.
Pasadena, 14 This letter from Petitioner's counsel stated, inter alia: "Without the County's compliance

15 with our requests, there is no way for the public and my client to access information about
16 the Project prior to the December 5, 2017 hearing. The longer the delay, the more the lack

17 of a further continuance prejudices my client and prevents 'a full and fair record.' City of

25 34. On or about November 13, 2017, County counsel responded to the

26 November 3 and 9, 2017 letters. The County largely denied the Public Records Act

27 requests, and stated the Resolution of Necessity and environmental staff report "are still

28 being finalized" and would be provided on or before November 29, 2017. The County also

2 regarding the Project. That letter notified the City of (1) the County's intent to acquire the

3 Property; (2) the County's intent to develop the Project; and (3) the County's assertion of

4 sovereign immunity over the City." The County expressly incorporated by reference its

5 October 9, 2017 notice letter to the City. That October 9, 2017 notice letter, with reference

6 to the differently-named "Manchester/Vermont Development Project", restated a Project

7 description that "generally consists of a transit-oriented boarding school, a multi-purpose

13 to adopt a Resolution of Necessity to authorize eminent domain, and of its intent to

14 approve a CEQA exemption for the County Project, both scheduled to occur on December

15 5, 2017. The County Project was now referred to as the "Vermont and Manchester Transit

18 community spaces, a transit vocational training center, a public charter boarding school

19 a and a parking structure. The Project also currently includes other community serving uses,

20 such as a publicly accessible transit plaza and a bus transfer center."

22 County further objecting to the lack of a clear or stable Project description, and recounting

23 points from their November 14, 2017 telephone conversation, including County counsel's

24 statement that he did not know who the "charter boarding school" operator is, but would

25 provide counsel for Petitioner with that information. Counsel for Petitioner confirmed "the

26 ongoing failure of the County to provide the majority of the documents that have been

27 requested, the prejudice to my client, and the County's failure to articulate any urgency
28 that could possibly justify, much less necessitate, proceeding on the expedited, 'cram-

provide any other

4 domain in an incorporated city for a 'boarding school' or similar 'mixed use' project like

5 the instant project . .. since the state dissolved redevelopment agencies."
37.

6 On or about November 22, 2017, County counsel responded to the

7 November 17, 2017 letter. County counsel for the first time refers to the "Vermont and

8 Manchester Transit Priority Joint Development Project", but simultaneously references

9 the October 9, 2017 letter from the County to the City, which identified a differently-

° Floor --40116 Avenue 8 215 North Marengo named Project and different Project description. County counsel emphasized reducing
10 homelessness and alleged nuisance conditions as reasons for attempting to use eminent

11 domain. County counsel said nothing about a charter boarding school, provided no
12 information about its operator, and gave no other examples of the County using eminent

13

3 41. In the Staff Report and Checklist, the County for the first time publicly

4 provided the bases it would rely on for the claimed CEQA exemption.

5 42. Among other things, the Project description and site plan provided in the

6 Staff Report and Checklist demonstrated vague and unascertainable details of the County

7 Project.

8 43. For the first time to Petitioner, the County through the Staff Report and

9 Checklist divulged some, although still incomplete, details regarding proportions, square

22 the following vague statements were made about the County Project:

23 a. "The Project also currently includes other community serving uses,

24 such as a publicly accessible a transit plaza and a bus transfer center."

25 Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that the County's use of the

26 word "currently" indicates it is not a stable or a finite description, but rather one that can and

27 may change over time. "Other" is vague and indicates the ultimate uses of the County

28 Project could or will vary. "Such as" indicates that the transit plaza and bus transfer may

1 not in fact become the "community serving uses" for the County Project, if any.

2 b. "The proposed Project will include community serving uses,

3 including a career technical education center, neighborhood serving

4 retail, and a community space."

5 Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that it is unclear exactly

6 what the term "community serving uses" means, and the public cannot tell or know with

7 certainty. For example, the term "community space" is so general it could be a "space" for

8 any type of use. The term "including" indicates there might be other, unnamed and
9 undisclosed uses, which may or may not be "community serving," even assuming that term

10 were defined.

POGI-LOLL 12 Works at the completion of the proposed Project to determine the

13 proportion used for public transit. If the facility ceases to be used for 8
Pasadena, 14 public transit purposes. . . ."

15 Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that this statement
16 demonstrates the ability of the County to eliminate, or never include in the first place, the

17 unnamed public transit "purposes" of the County Project after County Project

18 "completion".

19 d. The proposed County Project is stated to include "50,000 square feet

20 for community-serving commercial retail in the mixed-use building,

21 and 175,170 square feet for the boarding school. The community-

22 serving commercial retail component consists of a career technical

23 education center, and potentially other community-serving

24 amenities."

25 Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that the use of the word

26 "potentially" yet again underscores the amorphousness of the Project and its lack of an

27 accurate, stable and finite Project description.

28 e. The proposed County Project is further stated to include

4 square feet."

5 At the hearing on the Resolution of Necessity, County staff instead described the County

6 Project as "a public charter boarding school for high-need middle and high-school

7 students." Prior to the hearing on the Resolution of Necessity, the County never provided

8 any information as to who would operate the proposed boarding school, nor was this
9 information disclosed at the hearing. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based

10 thereon alleges, that the inability of County staff to identify a proposed operator or to

15 CEQA Regulatory Background and SCP Exemption

16 46. Compliance with CEQA is mandatory before a public entity may use

17 eminent domain to take property for a proposed project. Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena

18 Airport Authority v. Hensler (1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 577, 595-596; City of San Jose v.

19 Great Oaks Water Co. (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1005, 1017-1018 & fn. 5.

20 47. CEQA was enacted to advance four related purposes: to (1) inform the
21 government and public about a proposed activity's potential environmental impacts; (2)

22 identify ways to reduce, or avoid, environmental damage; (3) prevent environmental

23 damage by requiring project changes via alternatives or mitigation measures when feasible;

24 and (4) disclose to the public the rationale for governmental approval of a project that may
25 significantly impact the environment. Pub. Res. Code § 21000, et seq.

26 48. To ensure that environmental considerations inform public entities'

27 decisions, CEQA establishes a multi-tiered process. The initial step of the process requires

28 the entity to "conduct a preliminary review in order to determine whether CEQA applies
- 14 -

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- to a proposed activity.3 Parker Shattuck Neighbors v. Berkeley City Council (2013) 222

2 Cal.App.4th 768, 776. As part of this review, the entity determines whether the activity is

3 a "project" for purposes of CEQA and, if it is, whether it falls under an exemption. Sunset

4 Sky Ranch Pilots Assn. v. County of Sacramento (2009) 47 Cal.4th 902, 907. If the

5 project is not exempt, the entity proceeds to the other tiers of the CEQA process, which

6 involve the preparation of an initial study and, if appropriate, an environmental impact

7 report ("EIR").

8 49. A CEQA exemption is provided for a special class of Transit Priority
9 Project ("TPP") determined to be a Sustainable Communities Project ("SCP") by the local
10 jurisdiction (hereinafter "SCP exemption'). Pub. Res. Code § 21155.1(a). A relatively
J00kd pit 'anuaAy obueJem qUoN 9Iz OdV 'WAIL MVT NIELSSSATIS AHI 11 new exemption, the SCP exemption was enacted by Senate Bill (SB) 375, which amended
PO9L-LOLLE 12 CEQA to add implementation of the Sustainable Communities Strategy and was intended
emissions 8 13 to coordinate land use and transportation planning to reduce greenhouse gas
Pasadena, 14 from mobile uses.

15 50. To qualify for the SCP exemption, a project must meet a lengthy and narrow

16 set of criteria indicated in Pub. Res. Code §g 21155 and 21155.1, and provide for hearing

17 in front of the legislative body. This hearing requirement is special in that it exists

18 nowhere else for other exemptions in CEQA, and is intended to provide the public with a
19 meaningful opportunity to be heard on application of the exemption. In addition, in order

20 for a project to qualify for the exemption, certain findings are required to be made by the

21 lead agency, and each aspect of the criteria for the exemption must be supported with

22 substantial evidence.

23 51. In order for the decisionmakers and the public to be able to correctly

24 determine whether the SCP exemption applies to the County Project, the County Project

25 description was required to be accurate, stable and finite. In the case of the County

26 Project, this did not occur.

27 52. The County exempted its vague and continuously changing Project from

28 CEQA review under the SCP exemption of CEQA, Pub. Res. Code §§ 21155 and 21155.1,

2 hearing, and despite the fact that the County Project description as belatedly revealed failed
3 to present an accurate, stable and finite description, as alleged above and further below.
Procedural Issues 4

5 53. Petitioner objected to the County's actions regarding the proposed and then
6 actual approval of the County Project, the County's approval of the CEQA exemption to
7 support the County Project, and the County's adoption of a Resolution of Necessity to
8 commence the filing of an eminent domain complaint to take private properties for the
9 County Project. Petitioner has exhausted all administrative remedies available to it.

10 Petitioner objected both in writing, and orally in front of the Board of Supervisors at its
SO HNE BOMRAY O GARRNA AAON 11 meeting on December 5, 2017. (Despite the fact that, according to the Board of WHH MVT NELSHEATIS 3H1 POSL-LOLLE 12 Supervisors' public website, "[a] member of the public requesting to address the Board on
8 13 an agenda item will be allowed a total of six (6) minutes per meeting," and multiple VEV

16 previously undisclosed Project, with a few additional persons speaking on behalf of
17 Petitioner and Petitioner-related entities given only one minute each.)
18 54. On or about December 6, 2017, the County filed its Notice of Exemption
19 with the Los Angeles County Clerk for public posting. Petitioner has performed all
20 conditions imposed by law prior to filing this action, including complying with the
21 requirement of Pub. Res. Code § 21167.5 by providing notice to the County that this action

4 On or about December 21, 2017, more than two weeks after the December

5 5, 2017 hearing on the CEQA exemption and adoption of the Resolution of Necessity to

6 authorize the use of eminent domain, the County provided approximately 6,000 pages of

7 responsive documents in response to Petitioner's pre-hearing Public Records Act requests,

8 and in a manner calculated to deny Petitioner access to those documents prior to the

9 December 5, 2017 County hearing. The County continues to produce responsive

10 documents- as well as to illegally withhold responsive documents, which is the subject of
Petitioner's pending Public Records Act lawsuit against the County (LASC Case No.

91101-1504 DOV HE DNMROY WAH MY NIELSHEATIS 3HL 11 BS171709) - in a continuing manner following the December 5, 2017 hearing. As alleged

related entities.

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- 62. The County found that the County Project is a "Transit Priority Project,"

2 and therefore exempt from CEQA under Pub. Res. Code § 21155.1. However, the County

3 failed to make the required findings that the County Project is, and qualifies as, a Transit

4 Priority Project pursuant to Pub. Res. Code § 21155(b). Petitioner is informed and

5 believes, and based thereon alleges, that the County Project does not meet the criteria in

6 Section 21155.1.

7 63. An agency must sufficiently demonstrate that the exemption applies - and

8 each element of the exemption must be supported by substantial evidence. If any one of

9 the required criteria is not met, the County Project cannot qualify for the statutory SCP

10 exemption, and the Project must undergo environmental review. See Pub. Res. Code §§
APC 'wEL MVT THE SILVERSTEIN 11 21155, 21155.1.
b09-01L6 VO euepesed J001 pg 'anueAy 215 North Marengc 12 64. In order to be exempt from CEQA under Pub. Res. Code § 21155.1, a

13 project must qualify as a Transit Priority Project under Section 21155(b) and must meet

14 "all of the requirements of subdivisions (a) and (b) and one of the requirements of

15 subdivision (c)" of Pub. Res. Code § 21155.1.

16 65. The record does not contain substantial evidence that the County Project is a

17 Transit Priority Project.

18 66. The record does not contain substantial evidence that the County Project

19 meets all of the requirements of subdivisions (a) and (b) and one of the requirements of
20 subdivision (c) of Pub. Res. Code § 21155.1, including, but not limited to, for the

21 following reasons:

22 d. The record does not contain substantial evidence that the Project

23 meets the criteria in Section 21155.1(a)(1), which requires that, in

24 order to obtain the exemption, a project must "be adequately served

25 by existing utilities." The record, however, demonstrates that the
26 Proposed Project requires the provision of additional utilities and

27 emergency services. For example, the County includes a "will serve"

28 letter from the Bureau of Sanitation which states a truncated version
18 -

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

of the County Project as follows: "The project will consist of

2 residential apartments, commercial use, and a high school." The will
e v 10A serve letter thus only disclosed and analyzed a partial description of
the Project and cannot support a finding that no provision of
additional utilities will be required for the Project. Further evidence
of the inaccuracy of the County's disclosure of its Project parameters
is that the Sanitation letter does not calculate the wastewater that

co would be used for the school as a 24-hour boarding facility. The

9 availability of services and utilities for the County Project is a
10 required finding under the TPP exemption. The will serve letter does
100H ae 'enueAy oBueleW YpIoN 11 not support the availability of sewer capacity because it is based on a 2
PO9L-LOLL6 LAER UNOSANS SH 12 faulty, inaccurate and incomplete County Project description.

13 b. The record does not support a finding that the County Project has 8 Pasadena, 14 undergone an adequate preliminary endangerment assessment

15 ("PEA") prepared by an environmental assessor, as required by Pub.

16 Res. Code § 21155.1(a)(4).

17 C. The record does not support a finding that the buildings are "15

18 percent more energy efficient than required by Chapter 6 of Title 24

19 of the California Code of Regulations" or that "the buildings and

20 landscaping are designed to achieve 25 percent less water usage than

21 the average household use in the region," as required by Pub. Res.
22 Code § 21155.1(a)(8).
23 d. Respondents have not made an adequate finding that the County
24 Project is "within one-quarter mile of a high-quality transit corridor

25 included in a regional transportation plan," as required by Pub. Res.

26 Code § 21155.1(b)(4).

27 e. The record does not support a finding under Pub. Res. Code §

28 21155.1(c)(1)(B), which requires that the TPP developer "provides
19-

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

p sufficient legal commitments to the appropriate local agency to

2 ensure the continued availability and use of the housing units for very

c T 0N low, low, and moderate-income households. .. ." The Checklist
omits any reference to this commitment, and thus this criterion has
not been met and the County has omitted a required finding in order
to meet the housing criteria.
f. The record does not support a finding under Pub. Res. Code §

8 21155.1(b)(2), which requires that the "transit priority project does

9 not contain more than 200 residential units." According to the

10 record, the County Project contains at least 400 residential units (180

11 low income housing, 20 faculty residences, and 200 dormitories).
+OGI-L0LL6 SO MIENSB WHH MYT NEISHEATIS ZHI 12 67. The precise quantification of square footage and percentages is vital in order

8 13 to qualify for the exemption. The County fails to support its exemption with substantial
Pasadena, 14 evidence because it "approximates" numeric values in several places in the Checklist. For

15 example, on page 2 of the Checklist, the County states that residential uses comprise
16 "approximately" 51 percent of the total building square footage; a retail component
17 "approximating" 50,000 square feet of building area; "approximately 193,800 square feet"

18 of residential space. In addition, the checklist states that "The open space and transit plaza

19 component of the Project Site would total approximately 52,115 square feet" without
20 designating how much of the total would be devoted to which use.

21 68. In order to qualify for the SCP exemption, Pub. Res. Code § 21155.1(b)(5)

22 provides that the County Project must meet the following land use criteria: "Any

23 applicable mitigation measures or performance standards or criteria set forth in the prior

24 environmental impact reports, and adopted in findings, have been or will be incorporated

25 into the transit priority project." (Emphasis added.) The County Project fails to meet

26 this criterion. The language of Pub. Res. Code § 21155.1(b)(5) states that mitigation

27 measures must be "incorporated into the project." The County's Checklist does not
28 incorporate these measures but rather states the County Project "would be subject to"
- 20 -

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

-

2 applicable mitigation measures. Thus, the exemption cannot apply because the County's

3 finding that the County Project "would be subject to" mitigation measures in a prior EIR is

4 not supported by substantial evidence because the County exempted itself from City

5 enforcement, planning oversight and enforcement, and in any event, it is not the required
finding under Pub. Res. Code § 21155.1(b)(5).

6 69.

7 Pub. Res. Code § 21155.1(a)(4) provides that a PEA is required in order "to

8 determine the existence of any release of a hazardous substance on the site and to

9 determine the potential for exposure of future occupants to significant health hazards from
any nearby property or activity." Here, the PEA is deficient in meeting the statutory

JO0ld pg 'anuany oBueJeW YoN 91Z APC 'WHNH MVT NEELLSHEATIS 3HI 10 requirements, including because the PEA does not even discuss or disclose the potential for

11
91101-1504 12 exposure to future occupants to health hazards from "any nearby property or activity."

8 13 Pub. Res. Code § 21155.1(a)(4) (emphasis added). The placement of student activities,

Pasadena, 14 including but not limited to student residences, near a transit hub where potential hazards

15 exist from air pollution and general dangers posed by transportation uses is not addressed
in the PEA.

16 70.

17 The record does not support a finding that the County Project meets the

18 criteria under Pub. Res. Code § 21155.1(b)(2). In fact, the record indicates that the Project

19 exceeds the allowable residential units (200) under Pub. Res. Code § 21155.1(b)(2).
71.

20 The record does not support a finding that the County Project meets the

21 criteria in Public Res. Code Section 21155(a), which requires that a project be consistent
with the general üse designation, density, building intensity, and applicable policies
22 specified for the project area in an applicable Sustainable Communities Strategy ("SCS").

23 72.

24 The record does not support a finding that the County Project meets the

25 criteria in Public Resources Section 21155.1(a)(7), which requires that the Project site must
not be located on "developed open space."

26 73.

27 § 21155.1. The County also failed to follow the procedures required by Pub. Res. Code

- 21 -

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 74. Pub. Res. Code § 21155.1 requires the legislative body to "find[], after

2 conducting a public hearing, that a transit priority project meets all of the requirements of

3 subdivisions (a) and (b) and one of the requirements of subdivision (c)" in order to

4 determine that a "project. shall be exempt from [CEQA]." The County Board was

5 required to make such findings available to the public or any interested party.

6 75. Pub. Res. Code § 21155.1 provides that its exemption can only be applied

7 by the legislative body "after conducting a public hearing." The hearing requirement in

8 Section 21155.1 is unique as it is the only CEQA exemption that requires a public hearing.

open and 9 The determination of whether a project qualifies as an SCP must be made in the

10 with accountability. The decision must be made by the local legislative body at a public

11 hearing with full public input. Public hearings require procedural due process and the
+09L-40LL6 J0012 p,e 'enueAy oBUeJEN UION SIZ OdV 'WHI MV1 NIELSHHATS ZHI 12 Legislature clearly intended a meaningful hearing would take place if a lead agency

8 13 intended to apply the statutory exemption. A meaningful hearing did not occur in this case.
Pasadena, 14 76. In order to provide a meaningful hearing, certain notice requirements must
15 be met: namely, a notice that properly discloses a full and accurate Project description as

16 well as sufficient notice ahead of the hearing giving the public and the landowner a

17 sufficient opportunity to review the applicability of the exemption to the project at issue.

18 Neither of these happened in this case.

19 77. The County Board of Supervisors held a public hearing regarding the CEQA
20 exemption on December 5, 2017, but that hearing does not satisfy Pub. Res. Code §

21 21155.1 because it was a sham and provided Petitioner and the public inadequate notice

22 and no meaningful opportunity to be heard.

23 78. The County failed to disclose the basis for the exemption under Pub. Res.

24 a Code § 21155.1 until a mere few business days prior to the County Board of Supervisors

25 hearing on Tuesday, December 5, 2017.

26 79. In the evening of November 29, 2017, the County for the first time provided

4 prior to November 29, 2017, the County nonetheless failed and refused to provide any of
5 those documents before November 29, 2017.

7 members of the public did not receive or reasonably have access to the Staff Report and
8 technical appendices until December 1, 2017 or after, if at all.
9 82. By the County's actions in failing to make public the Staff Report and
10 technical appendices until at the earliest the evening of November 29, 2017 for a Tuesday,

1 85. By the County's actions in failing to make public the Staff Report and

2 technical appendices until at the earliest the evening of November 29, 2017 for a Tuesday,

3 December 5, 2017 approval of the Project, and in actually approving the Project on

4 December 5, 2017, the County failed to make a "good faith effort at full disclosure" as

5 required by CEQA. To the contrary, by its actions, the County attempted to, and did,

6 subvert Petitioner's and the public's rights.

7 86. By the County's actions in failing to make public the Staff Report and

8 technical appendices until at the earliest the evening of November 29, 2017 for a Tuesday,
9 December 5, 2017 approval of the Staff Report and Project, and in actually approving the

8 13 the County Board subverted due process by providing Petitioner and other speakers in
asadena, 14 opposition to the County Project with less time to present objections than is typically

15 allotted to speakers appearing before the County Board.

16 88. The County's unfixed, unstable and expandable County Project description

17 violates CEQA because it fails to inform the public and Petitioner of the actual nature of

18 the County Project, precludes an accurate assessment of the application of the exemption to

19 the County Project, and is a failure to proceed in the manner required by law.

20 89. The County's failure to provide the public and decisionmakers with an

21 accurate, stable and finite County Project description renders the December 5, 2017

22 hearing a meaningless exercise that did not meet the SCP exemption hearing requirements.

23 90. In addition, following the hearing, the County did not make all the findings

24 required by Pub. Res. Code § 21155.1, nor did the County make such findings available to

25 the public or any interested party. As such, the County did not proceed in a manner

26 required by law under Pub. Res. Code § 21155.1.

7 92. A fundamental tenet of CEQA is that the entirety of a project must be

8 analyzed together, in order that CEQA's environmental protection purposes are not

9 "avoided by chopping up proposed projects into bite-size pieces which individually
10 considered, might be found to have no significant effect on the environment or to be only

8 13 93. Improper piecemealing occurs "when the purpose of the reviewed project is

16 Conservancy v. City of Newport Beach (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 1209, 1223. The County

17 illegally piecemcaled the County Project.

18 94. The County's determination that the County Project is exempt from CEQA

19 under Pub. Res. Code § 21155.1 is not supported by substantial evidence, as the record

20 does not establish that the County Project meets all of the criteria required by Pub. Res.

21 Code §§ 21155(b) or 21155.1.

22 95. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy at law, and unless

23 enjoined by this Court, the County will continue to attempt to take Petitioner and related

24 entities' properties in violation of law and to develop the County Project without lawful

25 environmental review. Petitioner therefore seeks an order enjoining the County from

26 taking any action to continue eminent domain proceedings or construct any portion of the

4 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

5 (Violation of Article 1, Section 7 of the California Constitution

6 96. Lack of Due Process and Fair Hearing)

7 Petitioner incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 95 of this

8 pleading, as though fully set forth herein.
97.

9 The California Constitution, Article 1, Section 7, provides: "A person may

10 not be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law."

98.

11
91101-1504 SOAV AAPNARY O AHN A 'WHH MYI NIELSHBATIS 3HL As the property owner whose property and land use entitlements are

12 proposed to be taken by governmental action, Petitioner and related entities were entitled

8 13 to procedural due process under both the U.S. and California Constitutions.

99.

Pasadena, 14 Petitioner and related entities were also entitled to, and were denied, a fair

15 hearing before the County, and the Court is authorized to review this denial pursuant to
Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.5(b).
16 100. Black's Law Dictionary defines "hearing" as "[a] proceeding of relative
17 formality (though generally less formal than trial), generally public, with definite issues

18

19 of fact or of law to be tried, in which witnesses are heard and evidence presented."

20 (Black's Law Dict. (6th ed., 1990) p. 721.) The purpose of an administrative hearing is to

21 allow for the presentation of evidence and arguments

101.

22 Moreover, "identification of the project is an integral component of the

23 property owner's right to procedural due process." City of Stockton v. Marina Towers,

24 LLC (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 93, 108. Without it, a property owner cannot be said to be

25 given fair notice and an opportunity to be heard. Thus, "A governing body of a public

26 entity may not adopt a Resolution of Necessity until it has given the owner proper notice

27 and an opportunity to be heard on all matters that are the subject of the Resolution of

28 Necessity. . .. The public entity must engage in a *good faith and judicious consideration
of all of the pros and cons of the condemnation issues,' and its findings of necessity must
• 26 -

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

be supported by substantial evidence adduced at the hearing. . .. If the governing body

2 does not have before it a definable project for which the property is sought to be taken, any
discussion of the pros and cons of the condemnation would be an empty gesture and the

4 necessity findings rendered at the conclusion of the hearing would be devoid of real

5 meaning." Id., (citations omitted).

6 102. The County's action on this matter is quasi-adjudicative, as it involves the

7 determination and application of facts peculiar to an individual case, and thus procedural

8 due process requirements apply. Adjudicative government actions that implicate
9 significant or substantial property deprivation require procedural due process standards of

10 reasonable notice and the opportunity to be meaningfully heard prior to the public agency

11 taking an action damaging to the substantial property interests of landowners. The
191-40½L6 OO AE SNRA AE3 SIMARNY AUES SOSA 0S 215 North Marengi 12 proceedings at hand are adjudicative governmental actions that implicate significant

8 13 property deprivation, especially because the County Project includes the use of eminent

14 domain to seek to take Petitioner's and related entities' real property and the value of
THE Pasadena, 15 millions of dollars invested to develop the VEV Project.

16 103. The County was required to provide Petitioner and the other aggrieved

17 landowners with reasonable notice of the actual County Project to be constructed, and all

18 data to be considered at the County hearing that supported the CEQA exemption claim.

19 104. Due process also requires decisionmakers to act without bias or prejudice

20 toward any of the parties to the administrative hearing. Petitioner is informed and believes,

21 and based thereon alleges, that a majority of the Board of Supervisors on December 5,

22 2017 acted with bias or prejudice towards Petitioner and related entities, and therefore

23 deprived those owed due process of a fair hearing.

24 105. The facts in this case, especially as to Petitioner, show that the County did

25 not engage a in a good faith and judicious consideration of pros and cons of the use of

26 eminent domain. Despite extensive efforts of Petitioner to obtain meaningful information

27 about what the County Project was and how each aspect of the proposed CEQA exemption

28 did or did not apply to the County Project, the County stonewalled, providing significant

1 data only when it was effectively too late to properly use it prior to the County approvals.

2 In fact, the County specifically denied Petitioner, and the interested public, access to

3 approximately 6,000 pages of County Project-related documents, thus impairing the ability

4 to reasonably investigate the stability of the County Project's description, or to test the

5 claimed factual bases for each element of the CEQA exemption. Most of these documents

6 were not made available for use by Petitioner or other aggrieved landowners so that they

7 could place fully developed arguments and evidence into the record of proceedings. Such

8 actions deprived Petitioner and other aggrieved landowners of any reasonable ability to
9 make a full and complete administrative record. Further, the unjustifiable acceleration of

10 the public hearing process by public officials, particularly by County Supervisor Mark
11 Ridley-Thomas, support a conclusion that a voluminous amount of documents were
bO9t-101L6 DOM ANEO S AROY OBARSAL AOS WAH MYT NIEISHEATS 3HI 12 withheld until after final action to assure that no one could submit full and complete

8 13 arguments and evidence challenging the pre-determined desires of Supervisor Ridley-
Pasaden 14 Thomas and the Board.

15 106. The County provided only a few days prior to the County Board hearing for 5
16 Petitioner and other aggrieved landowners to review, investigate, develop arguments, and

17 assemble supporting evidence, with the limited amount of documents provided through the

18 date of the December 5, 2017 hearing, to challenge the bases for adopting the Resolution

19 of Necessity and CEQA exemption.

20 107. The County failed to give reasonable notice of the December 5, 2017

21 hearing in that the notice of exemption did not properly identify the proposed project and
further obscured and confused the public and Petitioner as to the true nature, scope and 22

23 parameters of the County Project, and the factual bases under which the County Project

24 could possibly qualify for the CEQA exemption.

25 108. The County's actions arbitrarily limited evidence during the Board's

26 December 5, 2017 hearing. At the hearing, Petitioner and Petitioner's six fellow property

27 owners, which have made a multi-million dollar investment in the acquisition and

28 entitlements for the VEV Project, were collectively given a mere 4 minutes (34 seconds 4

H per owner) through their lead counsel to argue objections and present countervailing

2 evidence to the hundreds of pages of the County's Staff Report and Checklist received a

3 mere few days before commencement of the public hearing, despite the fact that public

4 speakers are regularly provided with significantly more time to speak. In fact, under

5 County Board rules, the seven owners, including Petitioner, should have collectively had,

6 at a minimum, at least 21 minutes of time to present objections under the Board's

7 published rules of conduct, if not 42 minutes under the County Board's publicly advertised

8 statement that a "member of the public requesting to address the Board on an agenda item

9 will be allowed a total a of six (6) minutes per meeting." Given the magnitude of
10 Petitioner's property interest, the improper withholding of nearly 6,000 pages of County

11 Project-related documents, and the extremely limited time to investigate the Staff Report
b09L-10146 J00k1 p.e 'enuasi BUBJEN YYON 9IZ APC WHN MYTNIEISHEATIS 2HI 12 and data the County purported to rely upon in making its actions, a mere four minutes of

8 13 time by Petitioner's lead presenter to be heard by the decisionmakers was, on its face,
Pasadena, 14 constitutionally unreasonable and unfair. The Board's unreasonable limitations for
15 presentation by Petitioner and Petitioner's fellow six owners to address the complex issues

16 of the case in such a severely truncated time frame are themselves evidence of bias by the

17 County Supervisors charged with conducting a fair hearing. Instead, the four-minute limit

18 on Petitioner and related entities' lead presenter resulted in further impairing the ability of

19 Petitioner to make a complete record of the basis to deny adoption of both the Resolution

20 of Necessity and the CEQA exemption.

21 109. The facial unfairness of the collective four minutes afforded lead counsel for

22 Petitioner and related entities to present their case is amplified by the County Supervisor's

23 biased and discriminatory allocation of one minute of time to hearing testimony from other
24  potentially aggrieved landowners, opposing federal elected officials, and members of the

25 public, while allowing County staff and City of Los Angeles officials in support of the

26 County's eminent domain action unlimited time to speak. Significantly, Los Angeles City

27 Council Member Marqueece Harris-Dawson was given no limit on his time to create an
28 administrative record in support of the County's proposed actions, but Congresswoman
- 29 -

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 Maxine Waters' representative, who spoke against the proposed actions, was given one

2 minute to speak, and then was cut off. Only after complaints from the audience did the

3 Chair of the Board allow two supporters of Petitioner to cede their one minute each to Rep.

4 Waters' representative. After rushing to use those two additional minutes to speak, but not

5 yet quite having finished her presentation, Congresswoman Waters' representative was cut

6 off when the clock ran out, and the Chair of the Board would not allow her to complete

7 reading the statement from Rep. Waters in opposition to the County Project. The County

8 Supervisors' actions to treat public speakers in such a discriminatory manner based upon

9 their anticipated and actual speech, are further evidence of biased hearing officers seeking

10 to limit the record in order to assure that there would be no reasonable or judicious
J00id p.c 'enuary oßuere YoN OdV WHIH MVT NEISHEATS 3HI 11 weighing of the pros and cons of the proposed action on the record. That this behavior was
91101-1504 12 intentional by the County is further supported by the fact that Supervisor Ridley-Thomas

8 13 was observed to engage in celebratory conduct with proponents of the agenda item prior to
Pasadena, 14 the vote, by his actions of wholly ignoring pertinent testimony while conducting

Eo 15 simultaneous conversations with staff members during the hearing, and by his "tweeting"

16 in support of the use of eminent domain by the County the day prior to the hearing and

17 "tweeting" his thanks to those who spoke in support of the resolution immediately after the

18 conclusion of the hearing.

19 110. Prior to the administrative hearing and at the hearing, Petitioner and others

20 objected to the County's determination to take action without permitting full disclosure of

21 the County Project and the facts supporting the County's action. Instead of granting
22 reasonable further time for the affected property owners to complete investigation of the

23 County Project and alleged facts supporting the County's actions, the County Supervisors

24 rushed to approve the Resolution of Necessity, and the CEQA exemption. Petitioner is

25 informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that these actions were taken at the

26 insistence of Supervisor Ridley-Thomas. On information and belief, Petitioner alleges that
27 Ridley-Thomas's bias and intent to ram this Project through no matter the circumstances is

28 evident in his campaign to gain control over the Property, such campaign pre-dating and
- 30 -

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

leading up to the notice of CEQA exemption and Resolution of Necessity for the County
2 Project. Petitioner further alleges that Supervisor Ridley-Thomas' biased actions, and
3 efforts to influence the other Supervisors to act in a biased manner against Petitioner a and

4 the related entities, stem in significant part a from a history of prejudice and animus against
5 Eli Sasson, the principal of Petitioner and the related entities.

6 111. The record of proceedings is devoid of any evidence that any member of the
7 Board of Supervisors received and read any of Petitioner's arguments and evidence in
open record 8 opposition to the proposed actions. No member of the Board confirmed on the

9 that they had received or considered any of Petitioner's previously-submitted materials.
10 Because the County failed to provide to Petitioner or anyone else the Staff Report and
11 supporting information until a few days before the hearing, Petitioner's most detailed POGI-LOLL6 100H „€ 'anuary o6uJe qUon DAV HESANAY AEE S 12 written argument was submitted to the Board for and at the December 5, 2017 hearing.
There could be no evidence that the Board read and considered this countervailing 8 13

Pasadena 14 argument and evidence because the County Supervisors did not recess the meeting to allow
15 the decisionmakers to review Petitioner's written submissions, nor did the County
16 Supervisors continue the hearing to a later date in order to permit the decisionmakers to
17 read and consider the countervailing argument and evidence.
18 112. Further, Petitioner, as owner, never received an offer to purchase the
19 properties designated as Assessor's Parcel Numbers 6032-012-904, 6032-012-905 and
20 6032-013-905, a statutory prerequisite to the passage of the Resolution of Necessity.
21 113. As a result of these individual and cumulative violations of Petitioner's
rights to due process and a fair hearing, a Petitioner is entitled to a writ of mandate setting 22

23 aside all County Project approvals, the Resolution of Necessity, and the adoption of the
24 CEQA exemption, until the County affords a public hearing in accordance with basic
25 procedural due process.

the County Project approval, constitute an actual and/or threatened illegal, wasteful and/or

12 Because the County Project is not a valid or legal public purpose, and is

14 track the County Project is illegal, the County's expenditures in furtherance of the County

16 millions of dollars for and in furtherance of the County Project by the County, a public

17 agency using taxpayer dollars, constitutes waste against the taxpayers and general public,
and is illegal.

18 117.

19 Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that the
County, and in particular County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas, has had
20 communications with developers and/or parties with whom the County, through Supervisor

21

22 Ridley-Thomas' actions specifically and the Board of Supervisor's actions generally,
would be entering into or facilitating undisclosed and improper financial and/or business
23 relationships, including with regard to the proposed commercial and retail component of

1 part of the County Project, which Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon

2 alleges, is outside the scope of the County's authorized powers. By pursuing the County
Project, the County is further seeking to improperly engage in a redevelopment project not

4 (and no longer) authorized by law following the State's dissolution of redevelopment

5 agencies, and to purportedly eliminate blight that does not exist, and for which, even if the

6 County could utilize prior redevelopment law, the County had not made appropriate
7 prerequisite findings and resolutions. The County Project further includes the proposed

8 acquisition and transfer of private property currently slated for community-benefitting
9 commercial uses to other private individuals for a similar proposed use, which is both an

10 improper use of the power of eminent domain and which Petitioner contends is an

§ 13 for which, as previously alleged, the County has not complied with CEQA and for which it
Pasadena, 14 has not complied with constitutional and statutory notice requirements. The County

15 further seeks to prosecute an eminent domain action to acquire the subject properties for

16 the County Project for which the County failed to comply with multiple legal prerequisites

17 to the lawful exercise of the power of eminent domain, including but not limited to the
18 precondemnation offer requirements of Government Code Section 7267.2 and the notice

19 requirements of Code of Civil Procedure Section 1245.235.

20 119. The County's eminent domain action is further illegal in that Petitioner is

21 informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that the passage of the Resolution of
22 Necessity on December 5, 2017, upon which the eminent domain action is based, was

23 influenced and/or affected by a gross abuse of discretion. Petitioner is informed and

24 believes, and based thereon alleges, that the County merely "rubber-stamped" a pre-

25 determined result based on the numerous and apparently intentional denials of access to

26 Petitioner and members of the public to pertinent facts regarding the nature and scope of

27 the County Project; the improper hearing notice; the lack of any inquiry or investigation by

16 Time Waiver," in which the County requested a notice waiver from the City of Los
17 Angeles under Gov't § Code § 25351(d) for the County Project.

19 the County's approvals of the Project on December 5, 2017, the City Council had not
20 provided the waiver of notice under Gov't Code § 25351(d). In addition, Petitioner is
21 informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that the City Council has not provided
22 such waiver to the County. Therefore, on this additional ground, the County's approvals of

3 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

4 (Violation of Ed. Code § 17211)

5 140. Petitioner incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 139 of this
6 pleading, as though fully set forth herein.

7 141. Education Code § 17211 provides in pertinent part: "Prior to commencing
8 the acquisition of real property for a new schoolsite or an addition to an existing schoolsite,
9 the governing board of a school district shall evaluate the property at a public hearing
10 using the site selection standards established by the State Department of Education
J00H pS 'anuaNY oBuereIN YLioN SIZ APC 'WYL MYT NIEISHEATIS 3HI 11 pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 17251."
POSI-L0LL6 12 142. Although the County Board of Education did not formally act to approve the

8 13 County Project, which contains a school, the County Board of Supervisors acted in a
Pasadena 14 manner so as to effectively serve as the County Board of Education. Accordingly, all laws

15 governing school site selection and acquisition of real property for a new school site should

16 apply to the County's actions and approvals as alleged herein.

17 143. By commencing the complaint in eminent domain to acquire prejudgment

18 possession of and title to Petitioner's and related entities' properties, and the VEV Site, the

19 County violated the mandates of Ed. Code § 17211, which required that the County first

20 "shall evaluate the property at a public hearing using the site selection standards

21 established by the State Department of Education pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section

22 17251.» The County in its December 5, 2017 actions and approvals failed to so comply.

23 144. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 1085(a), the issuance of a writ of

24 mandate is required to compel the performance of an act that the law specially enjoins.

25 145. Prior to adopting its approvals of and for the County Project on December 5,

26 2017, the County had clear, present and ministerial duties to perform the acts and/or obtain

27 approvals as required under Ed. Code § 17211. The County violated these duties, and the

2 invalidated.

3 146. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, and adequate alternative remedy and has
4 clear, present, and beneficial right to performance.

5 147. Because the County failed to proceed in the manner required by the
6 Government Code, issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate, as requested in the prayer to
7 this pleading, is indispensable to secure for Petitioner and the classes of citizens it
8 represents the use and enjoyment of the rights to which they are entitled under those laws.
