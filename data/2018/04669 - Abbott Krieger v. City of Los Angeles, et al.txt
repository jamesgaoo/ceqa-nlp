VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT [etc.]

In support of his Verified First Amended Petition for Peremptory Writ of
2 Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief (the "Petition"), petitioner and plaintiff
3 Abbott Krieger, an individual ("Petitioner") alleges as follows:

INTRODUCTION

1. In this action, Petitioner respectfully petitions for a peremptory writ of
8 mandate and other appropriate orders to invalidate the action by respondents and

9 defendants City of Los Angeles ("the City") and West Los Angeles Area Planning
10 Commission ("the Commission") denying the appeal of a decision by the Planning
11 Director of the City and thereby upholding the issuance of a Coastal Development Permit
12 to allow the construction of a 9,074 square foot residence on a prominent coastal bluff in
13 the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of the City (City case nos. DIR-2017-2670-CDP-MEL-
14 1A and ENV-2017-4279-CE) (the "Project"). The Petition is made on the ground that the
15 Commission, by denying the appeal and granting the Coastal Development Permit,
16 violated the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Res. Code sec. 21000-21177)
17 ("CEQA") and the City's zoning code.
18

19 2. Petitioner also respectfully requests a declaration that the Notice of a
20 Exemption prepared by the City pursuant to CEQA and filed by the Los Angeles
21 Registrar/Recorder on July 20, 2018 is of no legal force or effect in light of Petitioner's
22 subsequent timely appeal of the Commission's determinations under CEQA to the City
23 Council of the City of Los Angeles ("City Council") on July 30, 2018.
24

25 3. The Project is located at 17642 Tramonto Drive, on a steep hillside
26 site that slopes down toward Pacific Coast Highway and the Pacific Ocean (the "Project
27 Site"). The Project Site is one of the steepest on Tramonto Drive and as such it has never
28 -1-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT [etc.]

F been developed. Tramonto Drive follows the coastal bluff and its downslope side is easily
2 visible from heavily traveled public roads such as Pacific Coast Highway, and from the

3 beach and coastal areas below, which are regularly used and enjoyed by residents and
4 members of the public.

5

4. The Project is the construction by real party in interest Mir Saied
7 Kashani ("Kashani") of a large three-story single family residence with a pool and deck,

8 and a wall (or series of walls) below the pool deck measuring 29 feet, 6 inches in height.

9 All told, as measured from the top of the roof to the base of the wall below the pool deck
10 the structure would be approximately 76 feet, 6 inches tall. This wall of development
11 would be plainly visible to the public from public roads and the beach and coastal areas.

12

13 5. Given that it has never been developed, the Project Site retains its
14 existing landforms, which are pristine coastal bluffs. The Project would destroy 5,586
15 square feet of this natural hillside by covering it with a massive new structure. The hillside
16 would be carried away by the truckload: About 4,000 cubic yards of grading and soil
17 export would be necessary. When combined with other, similarly large and destructive
18 projects recently approved or proposed on these coastal bluffs, the Project would result in a
19 cumulative aesthetic impact on aesthetics under CEQA.
20

21 6. The site and surrounding properties are plagued with geotechnical
22 hazards, thereby dramatically raising the Likelihood of a scenario in which the construction
23 would cause permanent alteration of these landforms, which would result in a significant
24 impact on geology under CEQA. The slopes between Tramonto Drive and Posetano Road
25 below are unusually steep, about 1:1 in gradient, and are characterized by loose soil.
26 Natural rainfall and poor drainage have caused many surficial slope failures. The City's

27

28
VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT [etc.]

Department of Building and Safety has repeatedly documented slope failures and
2 landslides on this and nearby properties.

3

7. The development of the Project has the potential to aggravate these
unstable conditions. The construction of an unusually large, 3-story house and separate
6 pool structure on these steep slopes, including the planned excavation of more than 100
7 piles, can easily cause moderate-size slumping of the slope (surficial failure), especially
8 during the rainy season. If there is pre-historic landslide present, the failures could be far
worse. Moreover, the site is so unusually steep that it is practically inaccessible for
10 purposes of immediately mitigating any surface failures. Thus, should soil material begin
11 flowing downslope during construction, it will damage vegetation in its path, further
12 altering the landforms below. Then, in order to clean up the failure and take other
13 remedial action, it would be necessary to create paths within the site to reach the
14 inaccessible areas, resulting in more landform alteration.
15

16 8. The Project includes the drilling of 105 deep holes for concrete
17 caissons, (i.e., foundation support columns), into these unusually steep hillsides. Most of
18 these caissons would be 40 to 80 feet deep. This sort of construction, which is more
19 typical for a shopping center than a single family house, would generate extreme noise
20 levels in the neighborhood, far beyond ambient noise levels, and lasting for between 16
21 and 51 days. The steep hillside also increases the noise impact because it reflects more
22 noise towards homes that are at a lower elevation, unblocked by intervening homes, and
23 situated below the Project Site. For these homes, the sound travels through roofs rather
24 than walls, which do not block sound transmission as well as walls. All told, more than 50
25 neighboring homes would be impacted with noise level increases that would continuously
26 exceed the maximum standards under the City's noise ordinance. This noise impact is a
27 significant impact under CEQA.
28 -3-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT [eto.]

9. The Project was approved after a public hearing by way of a
2 Director's Determination dated April 3, 2018 (*Director's Determination"). Petitioner
3 appealed this decision to the West Los Angeles Area Planning Commission, and another

4 public hearing was held on July 18, 2018. After the public hearing, the Commission voted
5 3 to 1 to deny the appeal. The President of the Commission, Esther Margulies, notably
6 dissented and said she would have granted the appeal due to its impacts on coastal-facing

7 bluffs. The Commission issued its Letter of Determination on July 19, 2018.

8

9 10. The Commission's denial of the a appeal included a determination that
10a Categorical Exemption was proper under section 15300 of the CEQA Guidelines, and
11 that accordingly no CEQA review was necessary, either by way of an Environmental
12 Impact Report (EIR) or a Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND).

13

14 11. On July 20, 2018, the City prepared and caused to be filed with the
15 Los Angeles County Registrar/Recorder a "Notice of Exemption" pursuant to section
16 15062 of the CEQA Guidelines (14 CCR § 15062) (County Registrar/Recorder file no.
17 2018-180306) (the "NOE"). The filing of the NOE commences a 35-day statute of
18 limitations period on legal challenges to the agency's decision that the project is exempt
19 from CEQA. (14 CCR § 15062(d).)
20

21 12. On July 30, 2018, pursuant to Public Resources Code sec. 21151(c),
22 Petitioner filed an appeal of the City's determination that the project is exempt from
23 CEQA (Council File 18-0715). There has been no public hearing or determination in that
24 appeal.

25

26 13. On August 1, 2018, based upon an inquiry by Petitioner's counsel as
27 to the effect of the NOE in light of the appeal to the City Council, Debbie Lawrence,
28 -4-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT [etc.]

Senior City Planner for the City's Department of Planning, advised Petitioner's counsel
2 that "After an appeal is filed to Council, the NOE ceases to have any legal effect for
3 purposes of the statute of limitations."

14. In order to protect Petitioner's rights, Petitioner's counsel repeatedly
6 attempted to clarify the City's position on this by requesting a formal letter from the City
7 Attorney of the City affirming Ms. Lawrence's statement and/or formally withdrawing the
8 NOE. On August 17, 2018, Ms. Lawrence advised Petitioner's counsel that "The City
9 Attorney's Office will not issue any written statement regarding the NOE."
10

11 15. The Commission's July 19, 2018, action denying the appeal and
12 approving the Project was final and not further appealable, except to the extent that the
13 City's determination that a categorical exemption was proper was appealable to the City
14 Council.

15

16 16. As pled more particularly below, Petitioner hereby petitions this Court
17 for (1) a peremptory writ of mandate under Section 1094.5 of the California Code of Civil
18 Procedure requiring that the Commission set aside its action denying the appeal and
19 granting the Coastal Development Permit, and determining that a Categorical Exemption
20 applied to the Project; and (2) a declaration that the NOE is of no legal force or effect in
21 light of Petitioner's subsequent timely appeal to the City Council.

AND COMPLAINT [etc.]

24. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
2 sections 392, 393, 395 and 760.050 because the Project Site is situated in the County of
3 Los Angeles, State of California, and within this jurisdictional district; and because the

PROCEDURE

c 25. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that on

9 or after July 20, 2018, the Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk of Los Angeles County posted
10 a Notice of Exemption for the Project prepared by the City under CEQA.

13 to be pursued by him.

14

15 27. Petitioner has no plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary
16 course of law, other than the relief sought in this Petition, which will prevent the City from
17 acting outside its legal authority. Petitioner has a beneficial interest in the outcome in this a

19

20 28. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to the filing of this
21 Petition, including the provision of formal written notice of the commencement of this
22 action to the City and the Commission pursuant to Section 21167.5 of the Public

AND COMPLAINT [etc.]

29. Concurrent with the filing of this action Petitioner will comply with
2 Public Resources Code section 21167.6 by filing an election to prepare the record of
3 proceedings relating to the subject of this action.

4

30. Within 10 days after the commencement of this proceeding, Petitioner
6 will have caused a copy of this pleading to be served on the Attorney General of the State
7 of California, as required by Public Resources Code Section 21167.7 and Code of Civil
8 Procedure Section 388.

10 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

11 (Writ of Mandate against all Respondents)
12

13 31. Petitioner repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 30, above, and
14 incorporates them herein by this reference as though set forth in full.
15

16 32. The Commission's actions should be set aside on these grounds:
17

18 a, The Commission's actions were an abuse of discretion because

19 the Commission's determinations were not supported by the findings;

20

21 b. The Commission's actions were an abuse of discretion because

22 the findings made in support of the Commission's determinations were not supported by
23 substantial evidence in the record;

24

25 C. The Project was adopted by the Commission without the
26 preparation of an environmental impact report (EIR) under CEQA, even though there was
27 a fair argument that the Project may have a significant impact on the environment and
28 -9-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT [etc.]

specifically on aesthetics, geology and soils, and aesthetics, and even though the Project
2 did not qualify for a Categorical Exemption under CEQA, in violation of Public Resources
3 Code sections 21100 and 21151;

4

5 d. The Commission's determination that the Project was exempt

6 from CEQA and properly the subject of a Categorical Exemption was not supported by the
7 findings, and the findings were not supported by substantial evidence in the record; and

8

9 e. The Commission's determination violates the City's zoning
10 code.

11

12 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

13 (Declaratory relief against all Defendants)
14

15 33. Petitioner incorporates herein by reference Paragraphs 1 through 32
16 set forth above.

17

18 34. There is an actual controversy between Petitioner on the one hand and
19 the City on the other hand, concerning whether the NOE is of any legal force and effect in
20 light of Petitioner's pending appeal to the City Council. On the one hand, Petitioner
21 believes that the NOE is not of any legal force and effect. On the other hand, the City
22 refuses to acknowledge this fact or to formally withdraw the NOE, thereby indicating that
23 it does not agree with Petitioner's position. A declaration from this Court is necessary
24 because the filing of the NOE misrepresents the legal status of the approvals for the Project
25 and forces Petitioner to file potentially premature and/or unnecessary litigation to
26 challenge the Project, even while Petitioner's appeal to the City Council is pending.
