PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/MANDAMUS

Petitioner/plaintiff Save Our Mission - San Juan Capistrano, an unincorporated

2 association of concerned residents ("Petitioner") hereby petitions the Court for a preemptory writ

3 of mandate/mandamus pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, to be

4 directed to Respondents and Defendants, the City of San Juan Capistrano, its City Council and
Design Review Committee (collectively, "Respondents"), along with other causes of action

6 alleged herein, including as to the applicant and Real Party in Interest Mission Commercial

7 Properties, Inc. (*Applicant"). Petitioner alleges as follows:

8 THE PARTIES

9 1. Petitioner is an unincorporated association of concerned residents of the City of
10 San Juan Capistrano. Mr. Steve Behmerwohld, a long-time resident of the City, is a member of

11 the Petitioner.

1 NOITT0  MEXEWMEN 12 2. Respondent and Defendant City of San Juan Capistrano ("City") is a public entity
13 located in the state of California. Respondent is required to comply with state law, including, but

14 not limited to, the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Res. Code, § 21000 et seq.)
15 ("CEQA").

16 3. Respondent and Defendant City Council of the City of San Juan Capistrano ("City

17 Council") is the elected governing body of the City and has final decision-making authority,

18 including the resolution of appeals. Like the City, the City Council is required to comply with

19 state law, including CEQA.

20 4. Respondent and Defendant Design Review Committee of the City of San Juan

21 Capistrano ("DRC") is an appointed body that reviews and renders decisions related to, among

22 other things, development projects being processed in the City. Decisions of the DRC can be

23 appealed to the City Council. Like the City and City Council, the DRC is required to comply
24 with state law, including CEQA.

25 5. Petitioner is informed and believes that the Applicant (Real Party-In-Interest)

26 Mission Commercial Properties, Inc., is a California corporation that is the owner of the real

27 property at issue, described below as "Plaza Banderas," and has and is processing further
28 development approvals for Plaza Banderas.
7517118.1 - 2 -

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/MANDAMUS

1 6. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of the defendants and

2 respondents sued herein as DOES 1 through 100, inclusive, and therefore sues them by such
3 fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this petition/complaint to allege their true names and

4 capacities when ascertained.

5 7. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that at all relevant times
6 mentioned herein, Respondents, Applicant, and DOES through 100, inclusive, were the agents,
7 servants and employees of each other and in doing the things herein alleged, were acting within
8 the course and scope of their authority as such agents, servants and employees with the
9 permission, consent and knowledge of each other.

10 FACTS AND GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

11 8. CEQA requires that public agencies review potential environmental impacts of a d1T NOITTIA 3AFWMIN 12 proposal and consider ways to minimize or avoid environmental damage. Under CEQA, the term
13 5 "project" means the "whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in either a direct

14 physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the
15 environment." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15378, subd. (a).)
16 9. "Approval" of a project, for the purposes of CEQA, means a decision by the public
17 agency "which commits the agency to a definitive course of action in regard to a project intended
18 to be carried out by any person." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15352, subd. (a).)
19 10. The project at issue in this petition is a proposed mixed-use project located at
20 26871 and 26891 Ortega Highway, San Juan Capistrano, California, (collectively, "Plaza
21 Banderas" or the "Project") and generally located at the northeast corner of Ortega Highway and

22 El Camino Real in San Juan Capistrano, California, Assessor Parcel Numbers 124-170-12, 124-

23 170-14, 124-170-15, and 124-170-16 ("Property").

24 11. The Project was initially approved in 2010, which included the preparation and
25 certification of an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"). As part of the Project, initial plans and

26 corresponding uses were submitted and approved by the City (the "Initial Plan"), although, eight
27 years later, no improvements pursuant to the Initial Plan have been built on the Property. The
28 Applicant has recently sought and received DRC Approval for material changes to the Project in
7517118.1 -3 -

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/MANDAMUS

contradiction to the Initial Plan, and many of the documents/agreements that were approved and
2 executed by the City and the Applicant's predecessor.

3 12. On information and belief, the above changes to the Project violate prior Project
approvals, including the EIR, the planned development/general commercial land use designations

5 for the Property, the Development Agreement ("DA") and the Comprehensive Development Plan

6 ("CDP"). These documents bind the Respondents and the Applicant with respect to the

7 processing, approval and implementation of any future modification(s) to Plaza Banderas.

8 13. The formal approval for the Project, Resolution No. 10-10-05-05 (the

9 "Resolution"), approved in October 2010, provided the following description of Plaza Banderas:
10 General Conditiona:

11 1. The subject project proposes a mixed-use development that oncompasses a 74,973
J'II NOITIL squaro foot, 124-room hotel, approximatoly 14,500 square feet of commercial land
12 uses, Including 6,509 square fcet of retail commercial floor area, a 5,747 square foot restaurant, and R 1,971 squaro fool private offica on an existing 3.18 acre property
13 located al 26871 & 28891 Orlege Highway and generally located at the northeast corner of Ortega Highway and Et Camino Real (APN124 -170 -12,14,15,16) NHAJMMIN 14 (Applicant; Stroscher G3, Gretchen Stroscher Thomson). Thie project approval is based on and subjedt to the application materiats prepared by Doug Lee, Lee &
15 Sakahara Architects and Land Concern deted and rovined to June 16, 2010 Inoluding slle plan(s), bullding alevation(s), floor plan(s), prellminary landsoape plan(s),
16 preliminary grading plan(s), treö removal plan(s), and any othor plans, These plans and the proposed use of the project slte are hereby incorporsted by reference into this epproval as submitted and condilioned hereln, and shall not be further altered 17 unlesa revlewed and approved by the affected cily departmente. Minor modifications
18 to this project approval may be approved by the Devolopmont Services Direcor pursuant to Section 9-2:303, Administrstive approvals of Tille 9, Land Use Coda,
19

20 14. The Resolution is quite clear, that in addition to the hotel component, the Project

21 must contain specific commercial/retail/office components as part of the Project's approval and

22 implementation. Despite this directive from the City, the Applicant continues to process and seek

23 modifications, through the DRC, which are inconsistent with the Resolution, and other controlling

24 documents discussed below.

25 15. In addition to the description of Plaza Banderas in the Resolution, Respondents

26 imposed numerous conditions on the Project, including Conditions 59 and 60, which provide:

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/MANDAMUS

16. Conditions 59 and 60 require that any design or construction plans submitted for
2 review include site plans, building elevations, architectural plans, landscape plans, and lighting

3 plans, among other things. There is no allowance that such plans can be submitted piecemeal to

4 different committees, yet this is precisely what the Applicant has done. On information and

5 belief, Applicant has made multiple submissions since 2016 for modifications to the Initial Plan.

6 Furthermore, Condition 60 allows the DRC to refer to any such plan consistency decisions to the

7 City's Planning Commission for final determination.

8 17. In addition to the Resolution and Initial Plan, the EIR for Plaza Banderas contains

9 the following description of the project for the purposes of assessing environmental impacts:

10 11.1.2 Project Description

11 The Plaza Banderas project Includes the develapment of a 74,973 square foot, 124-(0om hotel. The
d'1 NOITIIO  NTAENMIN -8 hotel wild accommodale an evant center with other amonitles, Including an outdoor swimming pool and

16 Plaze Banderas will provide needed services to residents and viuitors to San Juan Capistrano, incuding hotel, shopping and dining opportunitles,
17 3,4 Description of the Proposed Projoct
18 The proposed Plaza Banderao Motel Project is composed ot two land use components. The applicant is proposing a mixed-uso development (hat encompasses a 74,973 squaro foot, 124-room hotel, In 19 addition, the applicont is sleo proposing approximately 14,500 squaro foat ot downiown commoroial land usas, Including G,509 square feet of relail commercial floor area, a 5,747 aquare fool reslaurani, and 6

22 of this euructure ls proposed to be 37 faet 6 inches al its highest vertical extension.

23 18. In its most recent requests made in early 2018, the Applicant sought, through*

24 architectural design modifications, to either eliminate or substantially reduce the

25 commercial/retail components of the Initial Plan, and replace that space with additional hotel

26 space and hotel-related uses. The modifications also included numerous changes in the elevations-

27 of the buildings, which block views to and from the Mission San Juan Capistrano, a historical

28 site. The DRC approved those design modifications in January and February 2018, despite the
7517118.1 . 6 -

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/MANDAMUS

fact that no new initial study or other additional environmental analysis was completed.

2 Petitioner appealed the decisions of the DRC to the City Council. At both the DRC hearings and
3 at the City Council, the City refused to evaluate how the modifications to the Initial Plan will

4 impact biological resources, historic and cultural resources, traffic, and noise, among other things.
19. Additionally, the City and Applicant's predecessor entered into binding

6 agreements whereby the project was described in terms and conditions of how future

7 modification(s) to Plaza Banderas would have to be processed and implemented. Such

8 agreements with those terms and conditions include the CDP and DA.

9 20. The CDP includes, in part, the following terms:

10 Section 1.3 ~ Project Description

11 Plaza Banderas will consist of an approximately 76,000
1 NOITUA  HIAEWMIN square-foot hotel comprised of 124 guest rooms and an 12 approximately 16,000 square-foot commercial conter with retall and rostaurant uses on the ground floor, and a small 13 private office on the socond floor.

14 Section 2.2 Development Plan Description
15 The design and construction of the Plaza Banderas Hotel and
16 Mixed-Use Development will be unique and particularly sensitive to San Juan Capistrano's history, The superior
17 quality of the developmont will include prominent Callfornia friendly fandscaping, and a garden plaza connecting the hotel
18 with restaurants and shops. The Plaza Banderas Hotel and Mixed-Use Development is intended to attract residents, local
19 clientele, as well aS providing a unlque hotel, dining and shopping experience for out of town guests and vacationers.
20 The Plaza Banderas Hotel and Mixed-Use Development 21 project encompasses the development of an approximately 76,000 square-foot 124-room hotel at the north side of the site
22 and a commercial development of appraximately 16,000 square feet at the corner of Ortega and EI Camino Real. 23 There will be café dining and an event center in the hotel with

24 other amenilies such as an outdioor swimming pool and Jacuzzi, exercise room, media room, restaurant, and laundry facillties. The commercial component consists of

The Project site and landscapo plan is ahown to the exhibit below,
11 22.
II NONUO  NEAINMEN 12 The foregoing documents all demonstrate that Plaza Banderas and its approvals

13 contemplate the location and size of certain commercial and retail components dating back to the

14 Initial Plan. However, in the "new elevations" of multiple buildings in the modifications to the

15 Initial Plan, it is evident that the Applicant's plan is to eliminate much of the intended and

16 approved mixed-uses for the Property. In fact, in June 2017, the City expressly (in writing)

17 advised the Applicant that all plan submittals shall identify the uses of such plan submittals, a
requirement that the Applicant failed to comply.
18 23.

19 this Further, Condition 59 requires that all plans "shall" be submitted together. Yet, in

20 case, on information and belief Applicant piecemealed its submissions to the DRC,

21 culminating in DRC review and approval of selected pieces of the plans in January and February
2018.1

27 to In 2016/2017, the Applicant tried to modify the Project with new uses, a larger hotel, and underground parking,

28 among other things. When the Applicant was advised that further CEQA review was necessary, it abandoned those fully submitted plans. On information and belief, Petitioner asserts that the current plan modifications, which have been submitted piecemeal, are a veiled attempt to resurrect the prior abandoned plans,
7517118.1 - 8 -

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/MANDAMUS

1 25, An EIR for the Project was approved and certified in 2010. Eight (8) years later,

2 the Applicant was processing new building plans with the City, and seeking DRC review and
3 approval of various architectural and design elements for these plans. As objected to at the DRC

4 hearings, the proposed modifications differ substantially from the Initial Plan, so much so, that

5 there are likely going to be new or different environmental impacts that were not studied in the

6 2010 EIR.

7 26. At or before the two DRC hearings, and in addition to appearing to object,

8 Petitioner submitted written objections outlining many of the issues and deficiencies identified in

9 this petition/complaint. True and correct copies of these objection letters are attached hereto as
10 Exhibits A and B, and are incorporated herein by reference.

11 27. Both DRC decisions were timely appealed to the City Council pursuant to the d'11 NOITIC NHAIMMEN 12 City's appeal requirements. On or about March 20, 2018, the appeals of the DRC decisions were
13 heard before the City Council. Prior to the hearing, Petitioner submitted a further objection letter,

14 a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit C, and is incorporated herein by reference.
15 28. Despite the objections raised in writing and at the hearing, the City Council denied

16 Petitioner's appeal, upholding the decisions of the DRC. Petitioner has therefore exhausted its

17 administrative remedies such that court intervention is now appropriate. Prior to the filing of this

18 petition/complaint, Petitioner provided notice of this action to the Respondents on April 11, 2018,

19 a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit D, and is incorporated herein by reference.

20 29. Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law for the offenses alleged in this

21 petition/complaint, and petitions the Court for relief as prayed for herein.

22 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

23 (Preemptory Writ of Mandate/Mandamus -- Against Respondents and DOES 1-100)

24 30. Petitioner incorporates all of the allegations contained within paragraphs 1 through

25 29, inclusive, as if set forth in full herein.

26 31. Petitioner brings this cause of action pursuant to Public Resources Code sections

27 21168 and 21168.5, the California Constitution and the City of San Juan Capistrano's land use

28 regulations, the CDP, and the DA.
7517118.1 -9.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/MANDAMUS

1 32. Plaza is Banderas herein is considered a "Project" as defined by the California Public

2 Resources Code as it is an activity that may cause either a direct physical change in the
3 environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment.
4 Respondent's consideration and approval of the Project constitutes "approval of a project" within

5 the meaning of CEQA. Approval of the modifications to the Initial Plan for Plaza Banderas was

6 discretionary, not ministerial. As such, the City was required to comply with CEQA with respect
7 to those modifications, as well as any cumulative impacts that may result.

8 33. By approving the modifications to the Initial Plan without completing a new initial

9 study, or any environmental review whatsoever, Respondent acted improperly, and in violation of
10 CEQA. CEQA mandates a subsequent environmental impact report in instances such as those in
11 the instant matter, when substantial changes are proposed, or occur, which will require major dTI NOITUIO 2 MIAIMMIN 12 revisions of the EIR or negative declaration due to the involvement of new significant
13 environmental effects or a substantial increase in severity of previously identified significant
14 effects. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15162.)

15 34. In this case, and as alleged above, the proposed modifications to the Initial Plan
16 may create new or additional substantial impacts under the CEQA guidelines. (See Exhibits A-

17 C.) The differences between the original Plaza Banderas under the Initial Plan and the proposed

18 modifications give rise to manifest significant new impacts and/or a substantial increase in the
19 severity of previously identified impacts, such as the impacts to view to and from the historic

20 Mission, as well as cumulative impacts resulting therefrom.

21 35. Petitioner, therefore, requests that the Court issue a preemptory writ of
22 mandate/mandamus directing Respondent to vacate and/or set aside the approval of the proposed

23 modifications to the Initial Plan for Plaza Banderas, as approved by the DRC and affirmed by the
24 City Council,

25 36. The public interest will suffer from Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA,

26 its procedural due process requirements, and Respondents' land use regulations and the
27 agreements previously entered into regarding Plaza Banderas. Petitioner, therefore, requests the
28 recovery of its attorney fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.
7517118.1 - 10 -
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/MANDAMUS

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Declaratory Relief -- Against Respondent and DOES 1-100)

3 37. Petitioner incorporates all of the allegations contained within paragraphs 1 through

4 36, inclusive, as if set forth in full herein.

5 38. Actual and substantial controversies have arisen between Petitioner and the

6 Respondents. Petitioner contends that Respondents have violated CEQA, Petitioner's procedural
7 due process rights, Respondents' land use requirements, and the CDP and DA as to Plaza

8 Banderas, whereas Respondents contend that they have not done so. Petitioner further contends

9 that the proposed modifications to the Initial Plan for Plaza Banderas may not proceed in light of
10 these violations and potential environmental impacts, whereas Respondents contend that the
11 JII NOITTIC H MIAEWMEN construction of Plaza Banderas may proceed, as modified.

12 39. A declaration of the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to these
13 controversies is therefore necessary to bind any subsequent action or actions of the parties, and is
14 appropriate in the interests of justice.

15 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

16 (Injunctive Relief -- Against Respondents, Applicant, and DOES 1-100)

17 40. Petitioner incorporates all of the allegations contained within paragraphs 1 through

18 39, inclusive, as if set forth in full herein.

19 41. If Respondents and the Applicant are not enjoined from taking any further action

20 to carry out Plaza Banderas as modified, pending, and following, the hearing of this matter,

21 Petitioner and the public will be irreparably harmed. Petitioner, therefore, seeks interlocutory and

22 permanent injunctive relief enjoining Respondents and the Applicant from taking any further
23 action to carry out the construction of Plaza Banderas, as modified, pending, and following, the
24 hearing of this matter.

25 REQUEST FOR HEARING AND BRIEFING SCHEDULE

26 42. Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.4, Petitioner requests the Court
27 to notice a case a management conference to establish a briefing schedule for submission of points

28 and authorities, and that a hearing on the petition be held within 30 days of filing of all briefing.
7517118.1 . 11 -

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/MANDAMUS

WHEREFORE PETITIONER prays for entry of judgment as follows:
For a preemptory writ of mandate/mandamus directing Respondents to vacate
and/or set aside the approval of the modifications to the Initial Plan by the DRC and City Council;

Re: Plaza Banderas Project Changes Disguised As Construction Plan Consistency Application
Dear Members of the Design Review Committee:
This office represents Save Our Mission • San Juan Capistrano ("SOM"), an unincorporated association of concerned residents. This letter constitutes SOM's objections to the proposed modifications to the Plaza Banderas Mixed-Use Project ("Plaza Banderas" or the "Project"), which is being disguised as a request for a construction plan consistency determination by the applicant Mission Commercial Properties, Inc. ("Applicant").
Even the applicant's name "Commercial Properties, Inc." is simply a ruse as their new project presented to this Design Review Committee ("DRC") is to eliminate almost all of the commercial/retail components of Plaza Banderas in violation of the project approvals, the Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"), the Development Agreement (*DA"), the Comprehensive Development Plan ("CDP"), and the City of San Juan Capistrano's ("City") planned development/general commercial land use designations.
1. Introduction.
In its pending request before the DRC, the Applicant is seeking to either eliminate or substantially reduce the commercial/retail components of the Project, which were approved for 6,467 square feet of retail, 3,702 square feet of office and 6,095 square feet of restaurant use, and replace it with additional hotel space and hotel-related uses. In essence, the Applicant wants to make the Project look the same, but with different uses. This is improper. Further, the Applicant is attempting to succeed with its subterfuge by piecemealing its Project components before different City commissions/boards and excluding such items as interior finishes, landscaping plans, etc., which violates Conditions 59 and 60 of the Conditions of Approval and a recent letter from the City.
The DRC should not be fooled by the Applicant's scheme to change Plaza Banderas in its efforts to avoid having to comply with the above documents, such as formally requesting modifications as it did when it recently attempted to process the alternative "Inn at the Mission

Hotel" project. To the extent the DRC approves these back-door Project changes, it will certainly result in substantial, timely, and costly litigation, including California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code, § 21000, et seq.) ("CEQA") litigation. Any request to change the Project should proceed through the Planning Commission and City Council, accordingly, not the DRC.
2. The New Project Changes to Eliminate Almost All of the Commercial/Retail
Components of Plaza Banderas Violates All of the Approval Documents and the City Policies Underlying the Same.
When Plaza Banderas was approved, along with various other documents and agreements, the developer at the time (Stroscher), received a valuable entitlement called a "vested right" to move forward with the Project, and in exchange, the City would be precluded from changing the rules with respect to its development, such as the adoption of the Historic Town Center Master Plan ("HTCMP*). However, if the Project is changed, those vested rights are void and the developer must comply with all current land use and CEQA regulations,
Here, Resolution No. 10-10-05-05 ("Resolution"), approved in October 2010, provided the following description of the approved Project:
General Conditions:

1. The subject project proposes a mixed-use development that encompasses a 74,973 square foot, 124-room hotel, approximately 14,500 square feet of commercial land uses, including 6,509 square feet of retail commercial floor area, a 5,747 square foot restaurant, and a 1,971 square foot private office on an existing 3.18 acre property located at 26871 & 26891 Ortege Highway and generally located at the northeast corner of Ortega Highway and El Camino Real (APN124 -170 -12,14,15,16) (Applicant: Stroscher G3, Gretchen Stroscher Thomson). This project approval is based on and subject to the application materfals prepared by Doug Lee, Lee & Sakahara Architects and Land Concern dated and revised to June 16, 2010 including elte plan(s), bullding elevation(s), floor pian(s), preliminary landscape plan(s), preliminary grading plan(s), tree removal plan(s), and any other plans, These pians and the proposed use' of the project site are hereby incorporated by reference into this approval as submitted and conditioned hereln, and shall not be further altered
unlese revlewed and approved by the affected city departments. Minor modifications to this project approval may be approved by the Development Services Director pursuant to Section 9-2:303, Administrative approvals of Title 9, Land Use Code,
(Exhibit A, p. 1.)
As can be seen above, the Project approval contained several commercial/retail components that the Applicant is now trying to remove and interchange with more hotel-related uses. It should be noted that before the Project was approved, the property was designated General Commercial (GC), which shows that the City desired commercial and retail uses as primary uses in the area.

Design Review Committee

In addition to the description of the Project in the Resolution, the City imposed numerous conditions, including Conditions 59 and 60, which provide as follows:

The following conditions shall be completed prior to or in conjunction with the Issuance of building permits:

-hte 59. Design Revlew Committee (DRC) and Planning Commission Review and Approval of Preliminary Design Plans._Prior to the preparation of construction plans and speolfications, the applicant/developer shall submit the project conceptual design plans Including site plans, building elevations, architectural plans, landscape plans, lighting plans (including all light fixtures), color & materals board, wall sections, and door/window schedules to the Development Services Department for review and recommendation by the Design Review Committee (DRC) and for reyiew and final action by the Planning Commission. The Design Review Committee and Planning Commission shall assure that the conceptual design plans are consistent with the Planning Commission-approved concept-level plans and the City's Architectural Design Guidelines.

The scope of the Design Review Committee's review and the Planning Commission's revlew of the conceptual desigri plans shall include but not limited to the following: Provide a historic San Juan Capistrano deslgn character and avoid contemporary commercial elements in the two commerolal buildings o Employ simpler, less complex wall planes o Pedestrian scale, especially in the plaza, courtyard, and semi-public open spaces o Address tha scale of the tower element o Each building should be true to ite architectural style to the greatest extent possibie

O Revise the original Spanish Colonlal Revival stylo es necessary to provide a historic San Juan Capistrano design character and avoid contemporary commercial elements in the two commercial bulldings and hotel.
0 Hotel architecture:
0 Avoid corner cut-outs and soften building size at the gable ends;
C Employ darker colors, address balcony details, window placements and use of stone or other non-plaster wall textures
Landscaping to achleve:

O A substantial screen at the periphery of the site to soften vlews from the freeway and Ortega Highway botween the hotel entrance and Del Obispo Street and buffer the hotel from San Juan Elementary School
O A careful Integration into the hardscape and architecture facing onto the plaza to create an appropriate Interface with the Mission and the downtown area to the South,
Address other details consistent with the above, provided that masging and footprints of the buildings to remain as approved by the City Council. Update the Comprehensive Development Plan (CDP) design guidelines consistent with the revisod design plan to be approved by the DRC and PC. (DS)

60. Design Review Committee (DRC) Review & Approval of Final Construotion Plane. Prior to the submission of the construction. plans and specifications to the Development Services Department for Zoning Compllance review, the applicant/developer shall submit said plans to the Development Services Department for revlew and approval by the Design Revlew Committee which shall have authority to determine consistency with the Planning Commission City-approved conceptual design plans established pursuant to the preceding condition. The Design review Committee may refer the final construction plans to the Planning Commlssion for final determination. (D$)
(Exhibit A, pp. 10-11.)
These conditions require (using the word "shall") that any design or construction plans submitted for review include site plans, building elevations, architectural plans, landscape plans, lighting plans, etc. There is no allowance that such plans can be submitted piecemeal to different committees. Further Condition 60 allows the DRC to refer any such plan consistency decisions to the City's Planning Commission for final determination.
In addition to the Resolution, the Project EIR contains the following description of the Project for the purposes of assessing environmental impacts:
:1.1.2 Project Description
The Plaza Banderas project Includes the development of a 74,973 square foot, 124-room hotel. The hotel will accommodate an event center with other amenities, including an outdoor swimming pool and Jacuzzi spa, exercise room, media room, restaurant, bistro, and laundry facilitles. In additlon to the hotel, a retail/office/restaurant component is also proposed, which encompasses 14,227 square foet of retail commercial, professional office, and restaurant floor area at the corner of Ortega Highway and El Camino Real. This development component consists of 6,509 square feet of retail commercial floor area, a 5,747 square foot restaurant, and a 1,971 square foot private office (owner-occupied).
Project Implementation will necessitate the approval of the following discretionary actions by the City of San Juan Capistrano.

Plaza Banderas will provide needed services to residents and visitors to San Juan Capistrano, including hotel, shopping and dining opportunities,

Design Review Committee

3.4 Description of the Proposed Project
The proposed Plaza Banderas Hotel Project Is composed of two land use components. The applicant is proposing a mixed-use development that encompasses a 74,973 square foot, 124-room hotel. In addition, the applicant is also proposing approximately 14,500 square feet of downtown commercial land uses, Including 6,509 square feet of retail commercial floor area, a 5,747 square foot restaurant, and a 1,971 square foot private office, which is proposed to be owner occupied. The bullding height of the restaurant is proposed to be a maximum of 27 feet. The 6,509-square foot retail building le proposed to be one story, with the exception of the 1,971-square foot prlvate office component (occupied by the property owner), which is proposed as the second story above a portion of the retail. The building helght of this structure is proposed to be 37 feet 6 inches at its highest vertical extension.
(Exhibit B, §§ 1-1, 1-2, 3-7.)
It is quite obvious from the express language of the EIR, that the Project is a mixed-use development with specific and required commercial and retail components. Indeed, within the several hundred pages contained in the Project EIR, numerous consultants examined and assessed potential environmental impacts based upon the Project as described above, and not a different project with different use components.
Until such time as a new Initial Study is prepared, there is no environmental analysis for the proposed Project changes that are being presented to the DRC by the Applicant. This alone would violate CEQA. Even further, without additional environmental analysis, there is no telling how the revised Project will impact biological resources, historic and cultural resources, traffic, noise, etc. SOM submits there will be substantial impacts.
In addition to the above Resolution and EIR, the City and the Applicant's predecessor entered into binding agreements whereby the Project was described and the terms and conditions of how future modification(s) to the Project would have to be processed and implemented. These documents/agreements include the CDP and the DA. With respect to the CDP, it provides the following terms:

Section 1.3 - Project Description
Plaza Banderas will consist of an approximately 76,000 square-foot hotel comprised of 124 guest rooms and an approximately 16,000 square-foot commercial center with retall and restaurant uses on the ground floor, and a small
private office on the second floor.

Section 2.2 Development Plan Description

The design and construction of the Plaza Banderas Hotel and
Mixed-Use Development will be unique and particularly sensitive to San Juan Capistrano's history. The superior quality of the development will include prominent California friendly landscaping, and a garden plaza connecting the hotel with restaurants and shops. The Plaza Banderas Hotel and Mixed-Use Development is intended to attract residents, local clientele, as well as providing a unique hotel, dining and shopping experience for out of town guests and vacationers.
The Plaza Banderas Hotel and Mixed-Use Development project encompasses the development of an approximately 76,000 square-foot 124-room hotel at the north side of the site
anda commercial development of approximately 16,000 square feet at the corner of Ortega and El Camino Real. There will be café dining and an event center in the hotel with other amenities such as an outdoor swimming pool and Jacuzzi, exercise room, media room, restaurant, and laundry facilities. The commercial component consists of
approximately 6,500 square feet of retail, 6,000 square feet of
restaurant, and 3,500 square feet of private office (owner occupied), The Conceptual Development Plan is illustrated in
Appendix "B",

(Exhibit C, pp. 6-7, 12.)

Design Review Committec

With respect to the DA, it provides the following terms:
D. The Property consists of 3.18 acres, with a three-story, 124-room hotol, consisting of 76,363 square feet ("Hotel") on approximately 2 acres; 10,169 square feet two story office/retail building consisting of 6,467 square feet of retail on the first floor ("Retall Component") and 3,702 square feet of private office on the second floor (the "Private Officc Space"); 6,095 square-feet for restaurant ("Restaurant") and 190 parking spaces (the Hotel, Retail Componont, the Private Offico Space, Restaurant and parking spaces are collectively, the "Project").
The Project consists of a three-story, 76,363 square feet, 124-room hotel, on approximately 2 acres; a 10, 169 square foot, two story office/retail building consisting of 6,467 square feet of retail on the first floor and 3,702 square feet of private office and balcony aea on the second floor and Il 6,095 square foot restau- rant. The Project provides190 parking spaces to. serve all uses on the 3.18 acre site.
Access to the Project will be from one right turn in and out only driveway on Ortega Highrway, one full access driveway on EI Camino Real and one Iull access drivewny at the easterly terminus of Spring Street, Upon the ultimate realignment of Ortega Highway as part of the freeway interchange reconstruction project by CalTrans, the access onto Ortega Highyay will be extended as shown on the plans approved by the City of San Juan Capistrano,
The Project site and landscape plan is shown in the exhibit below.
(Exhibit D, p. 1 and [Exhibit "D" thereto].)
Finally, with respect to the Applicant's recent change of heart concerning the now- withdrawn Inn at the Mission' and this new consistency request before the DRC, it must be noted that the City has expressly advised the Applicant that it is required to identify the interior building space to show the commercial/retail uses for consistency purposes. This letter states as follows:
In addition, we noted that the in terior space for Buildings A and B is not Identifled in is the submitted plans. As you are aware, the approved 2011 Plaza Banderas Hotel plans identify the commercial component of the project tha is comprised of Bulldings A and B as consisting of approximately 6,467 equare feet of retall, 6,095 square feet of restaurant, and 3,702 square feet of private office. Please identify the Interlorbuilding space of Buildings A and B so as to ensure conslstency with the approved 2011 Planni ng Commission plans.
(Exhibit E, p.1.)
All of the above documents are consistent with each other; that the Project and its approvals contemplate certain commercial and retail components that are now excluded from the submittal to the DRC. Thus, by definition, the new submittals are inconsistent with the above and cannot be modified or reversed though a DRC meeting.

It has been previously presented that the Applicant improperly performed subterranean grading for a proposed underground parking garage for the now-abandoned Inn at the Mission project. Those impacts alone may have violated CEQA and other agreements.

Design Review Committee
January 11,2018

3. The New Project Changes Violate the Development Agreement and are Inconsistent with Project Approval Conditions 59 and 60 As they Attempt to Piccemeal Project Changes.
A development agreement can only be amended by a legislative action, and is subject to referendum. (See Gov. Code, §§ 65868, 65867.5.) The Plaza Banderas DA -- the very development agreement that purportedly constitutes the entitlement vehicle for the Project requires amendments to be processed through Government Code section 65868: This Agreement may be amended or canceled in whole or in part only by mutual consent of the Parties in the manner provided for in Government Code section 65868.
As set forth above, the new Project proffered by the Applicant differs significantly from Plaza Banderas, by among other things, increasing the total square footage of the hotel, and eliminating the commercial and retail components; rendering this pending application inconsistent with the Plaza Banderas DA. To approve the Project without following the clear statutory directive of Government Code sections 65868 and 65867.5 is to render the Project approval void as a matter of law. The City must ensure that the Project is approved only through the adoption of an ordinance pursuant to section 65867.5.
In addition, Condition 59 of the Resolution requires that all plans "shall" be submitted together, There is an obvious reason why the Applicant is submitting its subsequent approvals to the DRC in pieces - because it does not want all the pieces to be put together to show a substantial impact or change in the Project. This attempt to blur the required transparency of land use decisions should not be overlooked by the DRC. Further, Condition 60 follows and incorporates Condition 59 ("established pursuant to the preceding condition"). Thus, Condition 60 also requires the submission of all plans together for DRC review, not just the hand-selected plans by the Applicant.
4. The New Project Must Comply with CEQA - A New Initial Study Must Be Completed to Assess Potential Environmental Impacts.
CEQA mandates a subsequent environmental impact report in the following instances, among others:

(1) Substantial changes are proposed in the project which will require major revisions of the EIR or Negative Declaration due to the involvement of new significant environmental effects or a substantial increase in severity of previously identified significant effects;

(2) Substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which the project is being undertaken which will require major revisions of the EIR or Negative Declaration due to involvement of new significant environmental effects or a substantial increase in severity of previously identified significant effects.
(Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15162 ("CEQA Guidelines").)

Design Review Committee
January 11, 2018
Page 9

In this case, the differences between the original Plaza Banderas and the current submittal give rise to manifest significant new impacts and/or a substantial increase in the severity of
previously identified impacts. Those new impacts have been completely glossed over and were not considered in the Project EIR. Those new impacts give rise to a need for subsequent environmental review that properly discloses the new impacts to the public. (See California Building Industry Assn. v. Bay Area Air Quality Management Dist. (2015) 62 Cal.4th 369, 382 [196 Cal.Rptr.3d 94] [major purpose of CEQA to "inform the government and public about a proposed activity's potential environmental impacts."].)
In fact, based upon this new submittal by the Applicant, the City is now charged to conduct, at a minimum, a new Initial Study that can examine what potential impacts need to be
assessed further.
5. Conclusion.
Based upon the above comments, the attached exhibits, the entire Plaza Banderas record, SOM requests that the DRC deny the application for plan consistency, or a at a minimum, refer the determination to the Planning Commission.

Very truly yours,

S. Krolikowski

Re: Plaza Banderas Project Changes Disguised As Construction Plan Consistency Application

Dear Members of the Design Review Committee:
This office represents Save Our Mission - San Juan Capistrano ("SOM"), an unincorporated association of concerned residents. This letter constitutes SOM's objections to the proposed modifications to the Plaza Banderas Mixed-Use Project (*Plaza Banderas" or the "Project"), which is being disguised as a request for a construction plan consistency determination by the applicant Mission Commercial Properties, Inc. ("Applicant").
The Applicant's new project presented to this Design Review Committee (*DRC") is to eliminate the location and design elements of the restaurant/commercial/retail components of Plaza Banderas in violation of the project approvals, the Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"), the Development Agreement ("DA"), the Comprehensive Development Plan ("CDP"), and the City of San Juan Capistrano's ("City") planned development/general commercial land use designations.
Even just a cursory review of the "new elevations" for Buildings A, B and C show the significant changes from the approved Conceptual Design Plans, a as a means of modifying the design of the Project and subsequent uses at the property. There were reasons why the City approved the design elements and uses back 2010/2011 in the locations specified -- to create a truc mixed-use Project that requires restaurant/commercial/retail uses closest to the street frontages -- not more hotel rooms.
Rather than restate the objections raised to the DRC review of the Project from the January 11, 2018, DRC hearing, SOM attaches these objections hereto as Exhibit 1. In addition to these prior objections, which are incorporated herein by reference, SOM raises the following further objections.
Condition 60 of the Project approvals provides as follows:

60. Design Review Committee (DRC) Review & Approval of Final Construction Plans.
Prior to the submission of the construction plans and specifications to the Development Services Department for Zoning Compliance review, the applicant/developer shall submit said plans to the Development Services Department for review and approval by the Design Review Committec which shall have authority to determine consistency with the Planning Commission City-approved conceptual design plans established pursuant to the preceding condition [Condition 59]. The Design Review Committee may refer the final construction plans to the Planning Commission for final determination.
What this condition means is that the DRC must determine whether the proposed construction plans submitted are consistent with the conceptual design plans approved back in 2011, and as required by Condition 59. So far, the Applicant continues to submit proposed piecemeal changes to the Project, so as to hide its true intentions and to avoid claims of wholesale changes.
In fact, the City has advised the Applicant in writing that it is required to identify the interior building space to show the commercial/retail uses for consistency purposes. This letter states as follows:
In addition, we noted that the interior space for Buildings A and B is not identified in the submitted plans. As you are aware, the approved 2011 Plaza Banderas Hotel plans identify the commercial component of the project that is comprised of Buildings A and B as consisting of approximately 6,467 square feet of retail, 6,095 square feet of restaurant, and 3,702 square feet of private office. Please identify the interior building space of Buildings A and B so as to ensure consistency with the approved 2011 Planning Commission plans.
(Exhibit 2, emphasis added.)
In direct contravention of the City's written request to "ensure consistency," the Applicant is now simply ignoring this requirement to identify uses, as that would result in a finding of no consistency between what has been recently submitted and the approved plans. (See Exhibit 3 - Site Plans.)
One does not have to be an engineer or architect to realize that the Applicant has now modified/changed the elevations and various design elements for Buildings A, B and C from the 2011 approved plans. As Conditions 60 requires "consistency" and not "substantial compliance," by definition, the elevations and design elements must be uniform.
With respect to Building A (the retail/office use), a simple comparison between the approved plans and the new plans show that the north and east elevations are substantially different and that the south and west elevations have minor differences. (See Exhibit 4 - Building A Plans.) With respect to Building B (the restaurant use), the Applicant has changed all of the elevations and many of the design elements, as it intends to convert the approved restaurant use into more hotel rooms in violation of the various Project approvals. (See Exhibit 5 - Building B Plans.) With respect to Building C (hotel use), the Applicant has made substantial

Design Review Committee

changes to the west elevation and minor changes to the other elevations. (See Exhibit 6 - Building C Plans.)
As noted above, the Applicant is not identifying the uses of Buildings A and B, as required by the City, as it seeks to modify these uses by modifying the elevations and design elements. As the proposed construction plans are obviously not consistent with the approved plans, the DRC should deny the Applicant's request for a consistency finding and/or allow the Planning Commission to make such a determination pursuant to Condition 60.
If you have any questions or comments concerning the content of this letter, do not hesitate to contact me.

Very t yours, C

1. Introduction.
In its pending request before the DRC, the Applicant is seeking to either eliminate or substantially reduce the commercial/retail components of the Project, which were approved for 6,467 square feet of retail, 3,702 square feet of office and 6,095 square feet of restaurant use, and replace it with additional hotel space and hotel-related uses.

2. The New Project Changes to Eliminate Almost All of the Commercial/Retail Components of Plaza Banderas Violates All of the Approval Documents and the City Policies Underlying the Same.
When Plaza Banderas was approved, along with various other documents and agreements, the developer at the time (Stroscher), received a valuable entitlement called a "vested right" to move forward with the Project, and in exchange, the City would be precluded from changing the rules with respect to its development, such as the adoption of the Historic Town Center Master Plan ("HTCMP"). However, if the Project is changed, those vested rights are void and the developer must comply with all current land use and CEQA regulations.
Here, Resolution No. 10-10-05-05 ("Resolution"), approved in October 2010, provided the following description of the approved Project:
General Conditions:

1, The subject project proposes a mixed-use development that encompasses a 74,973 square foot, 124-room hotel, approximately 14,500 square feet of commercial land uses, including 6,509 square feet of retail commercial floor area, a 5,747 sqware foot restaurant, and a 1,971 square foot private office on an existing 3.18 acre property located at 26871 & 26891 Ortega Highway and generally located at the northeast corner of Ortega Highway and El Camino Real (APN124 -170 -12,14,15,16) (Applicant: Stroscher G3, Gretchen Stroscher Thomson). This project approval is based on and subject to the application materials prepared by Doug Lee, Lee & Sakahara Archltects and Land Concern dated and revised to June 16, 2010 inoluding site plan(s), bullding elevation(s), floor plan(s), preliminary landscape plan(s), preliminary grading plan(s), tree removal plan(s), and any other plans. These plans and the proposed use of the project site are hereby incorporated by reforence Into this approval as submitted and conditioned herein, and shall not be further altered unless revlewed and approved by the affected city departments. Minor modifications to this project approval may be approved by the Development Services Director pursuent to Section 9-2.303, Administrative approvals of Title 9, Land Use Code.
(Exhibit A, p. 1.)
As can be seen above, the Project approval contained several commercial/retail
components that the Applicant is now trying to remove and interchange with more hotel-related uses. It should be noted that before the Project was approved, the property was designated General Commercial (GC), which shows that the City desired commercial and retail uses as primary uses in the area.

In addition to the description of the Project in the Resolution, the City imposed numerous conditions, including Conditions 59 and 60, which provide as follows:

The following conditions shall be completed prior to or in conjunction with the issuance of building permits:

59. Design Revlew Committee (DRC) and Planning Commission Revlew and Approval of Preliminary Design Plans. Prior Lo the preparation of construction plans and speolfications, the applicant/developer shall submit the project conceptual design plans Including site plans, building elevations, architectural plans, landscape plans, lighting plans (including all light fixtures), color & materials board, wall sections, and door/window schedules to the Development Services Department for review and recommendation by the Design Review Committee (DRC) and for revlew and final action by the Planning Commission. The Design Review Committee and Planning
Commission shall assure that the conceptual design plans are consistent with the Planning Commisslon-approved concept-level plans and the City's Architectural Design Guidelines,
The scope of the Design Review Committee's review and the Planning Commission's review of the conceptual desigri pians shall include but not limited to the following: Provide a historic San Juan Capistrano deslgn character and avoid contemporary commerciaf elements in the two commercial buildings o Employ simpler, less complex wall planes Pedestrian scale, especlally in the plaza, courtyard, and semi-public open spaces o Address the scale of the tower element
O Each building should be true to its archifectural style to the greatest extent
possible

o Revise the original Spanish Colonlal Rovival stylo as necessary to provide a historlo San Juan Capistrano design character and avoid contemporary commercial elements in the two commercial buildings and hotel. Hotel architecture:
Avoid corner cut-outs and soften building size at the gable ends;
o Employ darker colors, address balcony details, window placements and use of
stone or other non-plaster wall textures
Landscaplng to achieve:

O A substantial screen at the periphery of the site to soften views from the freeway and Ortega Highway batween the hotel entrance and Del Obispo Street and buffer the hotel from San Juan Elementary School
O A careful Integration into the hardscape and architecture facing onto the plaza to create an appropriate Interface with the Mission and the downtown area to the South.
Address other details consistent with the above, provided that massing and footprints of the buildings to remain as approved by the City Council. Update the Comprehensive Development Plan (CDP) design guidelines consistent with the revisad design plan to be approved by the DRC and PC. (DS)

- 60. Desian Revlew Committee (DRC) Review & Approval of Final Construction Plans. Prior to the submission of the construction plans and specifications to. the Development Services Depariment for Zoning Compllance review, the applicant/developer shall submit said plans to the Development Services Department for review and approval by the Design Review Committee which shall have authority to determine consistency with the Planning Commission City-approved conceptual design plans established pursuant to the preceding condition. The Design review Committee may refer the final construction plans to the Planning Commisslon for final determination. (DS)
(Exhibit A, pp. 10-11.)
These conditions require (using the word "shall") that any design or construction plans submitted for review include site plans, building elevations, architectural plans, landscape plans, lighting plans, etc. There is no allowance that such plans can be submitted piecemeal to different committees. Further Condition 60 allows the DRC to refer any such plan consistency decisions to the City's Planning Commission for final determination.
In addition to the Resolution, the Project EIR contains the following description of the Project for the purposes of assessing environmental impacts:
. 1.1.2 Project Description
The Plaza Banderas project Includes the development of a 74,973 square foot, 124-room hotel. The hotel will accommodate an event center with other amenities, including an outdoor swimming pool and Jacuzzi spa, exercise room, media room, restaurant, bistro, and laundry facilities. In addition to the hotel, a retali/office/restaurant component is also proposed, which encompasses 14,227 square feet of retail commercial, professional office, and restaurant floor area at the corner of Ortega Highway and El Camino Real. This development component consists of 6,509 square feet of retall commerclal floor area, 5,747 square foot restaurant, and a 1,971 square foot private offlce (owner-occupied).
Project implementation will necessitate the approval of the following discretionary actions by the City of San Juan Capistrano,

Plaza Banderas will provide needed services to residents and visitors to San Juan
Capistrano, including hotel, shopping and dining opportunities.

3.4 Description of the Proposed Project
The proposed Plaza Banderas Hotel Project Is composed of two land use components. The applicant ls proposing a mixed-use development that encompasses a 74,973 square foot, 124-room hotel. In addition, the applicant is also proposing approximately 14,500 square feet of downtown commercial land uses, Including 6,509 square feet of retail commercial floor area, a 5,747 square foot restaurant, and a 1,971 square foot private office, which is proposed to be owner occupled. The bullding height of the restaurant is proposed to be a maximum of 27 feet, The 6,509-square foot retail building is proposed to be one story, with the exception of the 1,971-square foot private office component (ocoupied by the property owner), which is proposed as the second story above a portion of the retail. The building height of this structure ls proposed to be 37 feet 6 inches at its highest vertical extenslon.
(Exhibit B, §§ 1-1, 1-2, 3-7.)
It is quite obvious from the express language of the EIR, that the Project is a mixed-use development with specific and required commercial and retail components. Indeed, within the several hundred pages contained in the Project EIR, numerous consultants examined and assessed potential environmental impacts based upon the Project as described above, and not a different project with different use components.
Until such time as a new Initial Study is prepared, there is no environmental analysis for the proposed Project changes that are being presented to the DRC by the Applicant. This alone would violate CEQA. Even further, without additional environmental analysis, there is no telling how the revised Project will impact biological resources, historic and cultural resources, traffic, noise, etc. SOM submits there will be substantial impacts.
In addition to the above Resolution and EIR, the City and the Applicant's predecessor entered into binding agreements whereby the Project was described and the terms and conditions of how future modification(s) to the Project would have to be processed and implemented. These documents/agreements include the CDP and the DA. With respect to the CDP, it provides the following terms:

Section 1.3 - Project Description

Plaza Banderas will consist of an approximately 76,000 square-foot hotel comprised of 124 guest rooms and an approximately 16,000 square-foot commercial center with
retail and restaurant uses on the ground floor, and a small private office on the second floor.

Design Review Committee

Section 2.2 - Development Plan Description

The design and construction of the Plaza Banderas Hotel and
Mixed-Use Development will be unique and particularly sensitive to San Juan Capistrano's history. The superior quality of the development will include prominent California friendly landscaping, and a garden plaza connecting the hotel with restaurants and shops. The Plaza Banderas Hotel and Mixed-Use Development is intended to attract residents, local
clientele, as well as providing a unique hotel, dining and shopping experience for out of town guests and vacationers.

The Plaza Banderas Hotel and Mixed-Use Development
project encompasses the development of an approximately 76,000 square-foot 124-room hotel at the north side of the site
and a commercial development of approximately 16,000 square feet at the corner of Ortega and Et Camino Real. There will be café dining and an event center in the hotel with
other amenities such as an outdoor swimming pool and
Jacuzzi, exercise room, media room, restaurant, and laundry
facilities. The commercial component consists of
approximately 6,500 square feet of retail, 6,000 square feet of
restaurant, and 3,500 square feet of private office (owner
accupied). The Conceptual Development Plan is illustrated in
Appendix "B".

(Exhibit C, pp. 6-7, 12.)

Design Review Committee
January 11, 2018
Page

With respect to the DA, it provides the following terms:
D. The Property consists of 3.18 acres, with a three-story, 124-room hotel, consisting of 76,363 square feet ("Hiotel") on approximately 2 acres; 10,169 square feet two gtory office/retail building consisting of 6,467 square feer of retail on the first floor ("Retail Component") and 3,702 square fect of private office on the second floor (the "Private Office Space") ; 6,095 square-fect for a restaurant ("Restaurant") and 190 parking spaces (the Hotel, Retail Component, the Privute Office Space, Restaurant and parking spaces are collectively, the "Project").
The Project consists of a three-story, 76,363 square feet, 124-room hotel, on approximately 2 acres; a 10, 169 square foot. two story office/retail building consisting of 6,467 square feet of retail on the first floor and 3,702 square feet of private office and balcony aea on the second floor and II 6,095 square foot restau- rant. The Project provides190 parking spaces to sorve ail usès on the 3.18 acre site.
Access to the Project will be from.one right turn in and out only drivewny on Ortega Highway, one full access driveway on EI Camino Roal and one full access drivewny at the easterly terminys of Spring Street. Upon the ultimate realignment of Ortega Highway as part of the freeway interchange reconstruction project by CalTrans, the acçess onto Ortega Highyyay will be extended as shown on the plans approved by the City of San Juan Capistrano.
The Profect site and landscape plan is shown in the exhibit below.
(Exhibit D, p. 1 and [Exhibit "D*" thereto].)
Finally, with respect to the Applicant's recent change of heart concerning the now- withdrawn Inn at the Mission and this new consistency request before the DRC, it must be noted that the City has expressly advised the Applicant that it is required to identify the interior building space to show the commercial/retail uses for consistency purposes. This letter states as follows:

In addilion, we noted that the in terior space for Buildings A and B is notidentified in the submitted plans. As you are aware, the ap proved 2011 Plaza Banderas Hotel plans identify the commercial component of the project that is comprised of Bulldings A and B as consisting of approximately 6,467 square feet of retail. 6,C95 square feet of restaurant, and 3,702 square feet of private office. Please identify the interl orbuilding space of Buildings A and B so as to ensure consístency with the approved 2011 Planni ng Commission plans.
(Exhibit E, p. 1.)
All of the above documents are consistent with each other; that the Project and its approvals contemplate certain commercial and retail components that are now excluded from the submittal to the DRC. Thus, by definition, the new submittals are inconsistent with the above and cannot be modified or reversed though a DRC meeting.

It has been previously presented that the Applicant improperly performed subterranean grading for a proposed underground parking garage for the now-abandoned Inn at the Mission project. Those impacts alone may have violated CEQA and other agreements.

Design Review Committee
January 11,2018

3. The New Project Changes Violate the Development Agreement and are Inconsistent with Project Approval Conditions 59 and 60 As they Attempt to Piecemeal Project Changes.
A development agreement can only be amended by a legislative action, and is subject to referendum. (See Gov. Code, §8 65868, 65867.5.) The Plaza Banderas DA - the very development agreement that purportedly constitutes the entitlement vehicle for the Project requires amendments to be processed through Government Code section 65868: This Agreement may be amended or canceled in whole or in part only by mutual consent of the Parties in the manner provided for in Government Code section 65868.
As set forth above, the new Project proffered by the Applicant differs significantly from Plaza Banderas, by among other things, increasing the total square footage of the hotel, and climinating the commercial and retail components; rendering this pending application inconsistent with the Plaza Banderas DA. To approve the Project without following the clear statutory directive of Government Code sections. 65868 and 65867.5 is to render the Project approval void as a matter of law. The City must ensure that the adoption of an ordinance pursuant to section 65867.5. the Project is approved only through

In addition, Condition 59 of the Resolution requires that all plans "shall" be submitted together. There is an obvious reason why the Applicant is submitting its subsequent approvals to the DRC in pieces - because it does not want all the pieces to be put together to show a substantial impact or change in the Project. This attempt to blur the required transparency of land use decisions should not be overlooked by the DRC. Further, Condition 60 follows and incorporates Condition 59 (*established pursuant to the preceding condition"). Thus, Condition 60 also requires the submission of all plans together for DRC review, not just the hand-selected plans by the Applicant.
4. The New Project Must Comply with CEQA - A New Initial Study Must Be Completed to Assess Potential Environmental Impacts.
CEQA mandates a subsequent environmental impact report in the following instances, among others:

(1) Substantial changes are proposed in the project which will require major revisions of the EIR or Negative Declaration due to the involvement of new significant environmental effects or a substantial increase in severity of previously identified significant effects;

(2) Substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which the project is being undertaken which will require major revisions of the EIR or Negative Declaration due to involvement of new significant environmental effects or a substantial a increase in severity of previously identified significant effects.
(Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15162 ("CEQA Guidelines").)

Design Review Committee
January 11,2018
Page

In this case, the differences between the original Plaza Banderas and the current submittal give rise to manifest significant new impacts and/or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified impacts. Those new impacts have been completely glossed over and were not considered in the Project EIR. Those new impacts give rise to a need for subsequent environmental review that properly discloses the new impacts to the public. (See California Building Industry Assn. v. Bay Area Air Quality Management Dist. (2015) 62 Cal.4th 369, 382 [196 Cal.Rptr.3d 94] [major purpose of CEQA to "inform the government and public about a proposed activity's potential environmental impacts."].)
In fact. based upon this new submittal by the Applicant, the City is now charged to conduct, at a minimum, a new Initial Study that can examine what potential impacts need to be assessed further.
5. Conclusion.
Based upon the above comments, the attached exhibits, the entire Plaza Banderas record, SOM requests that the DRC deny the application for plan consistency, or at a minimum, refer the determination to the Planning Commission.

Very truly yours, .Aricond

Dear Mr. Griffith:

Thank you for your submittal of the architectural plans for Buildings A and B. Pursuant to Condition of Approval No. 60 of the Plaza Banderas entitlements, the plans will be presented to the City's Design Review Committee (DRC) for their consideration of whether said plans are consistent with the 2011 Planning Commission approved conceptual design plans. City staff is reviewing the plans and will notify you shortly of the anticipated date for the DRC's review.

We understand that the architectural plans for the hotel building will be submitted at a later date. Given the DRC's task as stipulated in Condition No. 60, the DRC may wish to review the design relationship between Buildings A and B and the hotel building. To facilitate the review of Buildings A and B, please submit the exterior elevations of the hotel building now so that we may provide them to the DRC for informational purposes when they review Buildings A and B. If said elevations are not available now, please provide a us with a target submittal date for the hotel
architectural plans.

In addition, we noted that the interior space for Buildings A and B is not identifiled in the submitted plans. As you are aware, the approved 2011 Plaza Banderas Hotel plans identify the commercial component of the project that is comprised of Buildings A and B as consisting of approximately 6,467 square feet of retail, 6,095 square feet of restaurant, and 3,702 square feet of private office. Please identify the interior building space of Buildings A and B so as to ensure consistency with the approved 2011 Planning Commission plans.

Re: Appeals of DRC Decisions - Plaza Banderas Project Changes Disguised As
Construction Plan Consistency Requests
Dear Members of the City Council:
This office represents Save Our Mission - San Juan Capistrano ("SOM"), an unincorporated association of concerned residents. This letter constitutes SOM's objections to the proposed modifications to the Plaza Banderas Mixed-Use Project ("Plaza Banderas" or the "Project"), which is being disguised as a request for a construction plan consistency determination by the applicant Mission Commercial Properties, Inc. ("Applicant").
This appeal pertains to two separate Design Review Committee ("DRC") hearings/decisions, wherein the Applicant presented piecemeal design plans to eliminate the size,
location and design elements of the restaurant/commercial/retail components of Plaza Banderas in violation of the project approvals, the Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"), the Development Agreement ("DA"), the Comprehensive Development Plan (*CDP*), and the City of San Juan Capistrano's ("City") planned development/general commercial land use designations.
In two prior submittals to the DRC, SOM outlined the Applicant's improper attempt(s) to (1) materially change the square footages of various Project components (see Exhibit 1 - January 11, 2018, letter to the DRC); and (2) change specific approved design elements and Project uses (see Exhibit 2 - February 8, 2018 letter to the DRC). Exhibits 1 and 2 are hereby incorporated herein by reference. In addition to the facts, attachments and arguments previously presented in Exhibits 1 and 2, SOM makes the following further objections related to these appeals.
I. The City's Rules Regarding Consistency and Use Submittals.
Condition 60 of the Project approvals provides as follows:
60. Design Review Committee (DRC) Review & Approval of Final Construction Plans.
Prior to the submission of the construction plans and specifications to the Development Services Department for Zoning Compliance review, the applicant/developer shall submit said plans to the Development Services Department for review and approval by the

City Clerk/City Council

Page 2

Design Review Committee which shall have authority to determine consistency with the Planning Commission City-approved conceptual design plans established pursuant to the preceding condition [Condition 59]. The Design Review Committee may refer the final construction plans to the Planning Commission for final determination.
What this condition means is that the DRC must determine whether the proposed construction plans submitted are consistent with the conceptual design plans approved back in 2011, and as required by Condition 59.
In this regard, the City advised the Applicant in writing that it is required to identify the interior building space to show the commercial/retail uses for consistency purposes. This City letter states as follows:
In addition, we noted that the interior space for Buildings A and B is not identified in the submitted plans. As you are aware, the approved 2011 Plaza Banderas Hotel plans identify the commercial component of the project that is comprised of Bulldings A and B as consisting of approximately 6,467 square feet of retail, 6,095 square feet of restaurant, and 3,702 square feet of private office. Please identify the interior building space of Buildings A and B so US to ensure consistency with the approved 2011 Planning Commission plans.
In direct contravention of the City's written request to "ensure consistency," the Applicant is ignoring this requirement to identify uses, as that would result in a finding of no consistency between what has been recently submitted and the approved plans.
2. Further Provisions of The Project's Documents Support Reversal of the DRC Decisions.
In addition to the many references to the Project documents contained within the January 11, 2018, letter (Exhibit 1), the EIR, the DA and CDP provide additional guidance with respect to assessing consistency.
First, in the EIR for the Project, the view studies and aesthetic assessments were premised upon the restaurant/retail/commercial components being located "along the El Camino Real frontage" and at the corner of "El Camino Real and Ortega Highway." (EIR, § 4.12-7.) These specific uses were intended to soften the impacts of the overall scale of the Project and to compliment the character of the existing downtown uses located adjacent to the Mission. (Id.) Indeed, the EIR, identifies that the restaurant will be "located along El Camino Real." (EIR, § 3- 11.) By allowing design changes that are meant to eliminate these uses from the EI Camino Real and Ortega Highways frontages, the Applicant is violating the findings of the EIR, and would subject the City to challenges under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CRQA").
Second, the site design references contained within the CDP require connectivity between the commercial uses at the site to the Mission and other downtown facilities. (CDP, p. 13.) By making design changes that have the sole purpose of converting the commercial components of the Project to hotel rooms or suites, the Applicant is violating the intent and objectives of the CDP. Several references to other CDP violations are contained within the January 11, 2018, letter. (Exhibit 1, pp. 5-6.)

City Clerk/City Council
March 19, 2018
Page 3

Third, with respect to setback issues, the CDP requires the following:
To better articulate and take advantage of the clear pedestrian-focus of the adjacent Mission, the commercial uses lining El Camino Real shall orient their entries to face the street, or add additional landscaping and detail to create the same effect. This will
protect the unique streetscape, and aide in merchant success and retention as visitors and new customers experience an interesting and pleasant street front.
(CDP, pp, 20, 27.)
Through its proposed Project design revisions, the Applicant is attempting to shift focus away from the required unique commercial streetscape that. will attract commercial customers towards design that furthers hotel uses.
Fourth, from reviewing the revised plans, with respect to Building A (the retail/office use), a simple comparison between the approved plans and the new plans show that the north and east elevations are substantially different and that the south and west elevations have minor differences. With respect to Building B (the restaurant use), the Applicant has changed all of the elevations and many of the design elements, as it intends to convert the approved restaurant use into more hotel rooms in violation of the various Project approvals. Finally, with respect to Building C (hotel use), the Applicant has made substantial changes to the west clevation and minor changes to the other elevations. (See Exhibit 2.)
Fifth, at the last DRC hearing in February 2018, committee member Williams, who has previously recused himself in other matters involving the Applicant, presented his positions to convince the other DRC members to vote in favor of a consistency finding. This constitutes an impermissible conflict of interest.
3. Conclusion.
SOM has submitted two prior objection letters to the DRC's requested consistency decisions under Conditions 59 and 60. As the Applicant's new plans are not consistent with what was previously approved and in violation of the Project documents, SOM respectfully requests that the City Council reverse the decisions of the DRC.
If you have any questions or comments concerning the content of this letter, do not hesitate to contact me.

Re: Save Our Mission - San Juan Capistrano v. City of San Juan Capistrano Notice of Commencement of Action
To Whom It May Concern:
This letter shall serve as notice pursuant to Public Resources Code, section 21167.5 that Save Our Mission - San Juan Capistrano, an unincorporated association of concerned residents, is commencing an action in California Superior Court against the City of San Juan Capistrano and its Design Review Committee and City Council.
The action is in relation to the project commonly referred to as "Plaza Banderas" or "Plaza Banderas Hotel," referred to in Resolution 10-10-05-05, a proposed mixed-use project located at 26871 and 26891 Ortega Highway, San Juan Capistrano, California, and generally at the northeast corner of Ortega Highway and EI Camino Real in San Juan Capistrano, California, APN 124-170-12, 124-170-14, 124-170-15, and 124-170-16.
The action seeks a writ of mandate/mandamus to set aside the decision of the City of San Juan Capistrano's Design Review Committee and City Council to grant modifications to the initial plan for Plaza Banderas in violation of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") (Public Resources Code, $§ 21000 et seq.), which final decision was made by the City Council on March 20, 2018, That decision was made without the necessary additional environmental review as the modifications to the project may create new significant environmental impacts and/or lead to. a substantial increase in severity of the previously identified significant impacts, including cumulative impacts.
In this case, the proposed modifications to the initially approved plans for Plaza Banderas serve to create additional and/or substantial environmental impacts that were not studied when the project was approved.
