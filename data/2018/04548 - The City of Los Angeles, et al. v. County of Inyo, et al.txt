PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. On August 15, 2017, Respondents County of Inyo and its Board of Supervisors
3 (together, "Inyo") approved three Resolutions of Necessity, authorizing condemnation of three
4 parcels of property owned by Petitioner the City of Los Angeles ("City"), acting by and through
5 its Department of Water and Power ("LADWP").

6 2. Inyo improperly contends that its approvals are categorically exempt from the
7 requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). Through this Petition,
8 LADWP seeks relief for Inyo's prejudicial abuse of discretion.

9 3. Notably, the three parcels of property (hercinafter, the "LADWP Properties") are
10 part of the approximately 252,000 acres of land that LADWP owns in Inyo County. LADWP'S
11 landholdings are tied to its historic water rights, which originated with the appropriation of the
12 Owens River at Charley's Butte, near Independence, California. For more than a century,
13 LADWP has managed its lands to preserve and protect the Owens Valley watershed for the
14 mutual benefit of Inyo and the City. LADWP's ability to protect this vast watershed, and to
15 provide reliable and clean water to Inyo and the City's over four million inhabitants, is
16 inextricably intertwined with its ability to manage the activities that occur on its lands.
17 4. To effectively manage and oversee its lands, LADWP employs professional
18 hydrologists, biologists, and engineers who are tasked with monitoring the health and welfare of
19 the physical environment. LADWP's staff is responsible for ensuring that LADWP's water
20 gathering operations do not unnecessarily result in adverse impacts to the environment, and that
21 LADWP is able to maintain a reliable supply of water for the City and Inyo. To achieve these
22 goals, LADWP's team engages in constant groundwater measuring and monitoring, vegetation
23 monitoring, fishery monitoring, air quality monitoring, and a multitude of other technical
24 activities that are mission critical to the health and safety of LADWP's water supply.
25 5. LADWP is also a party to several environmental agreements that seek to preserve
26 the pristine nature of the watershed, provide frameworks for environmental projects and water
27 supply protection, and provide public forums through which LADWP reports on its operations.
28 The most relevant agreement is the Inyo/LA Long Term Water Agreement, which was entered as
1509196.1 2
PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 a Stipulation and Order for Judgment in City of Los Angeles V. Board of Supervisors of the

2 County of Inyo (Inyo County Superior Court, Case No. 12908). The Inyo/LA Long Term Water

3 Agreement has the overall goal of managing water resources within Inyo County to avoid certain

4 described decreases and changes in vegetation, to cause no significant effect on the environment

5 which cannot be acceptably mitigated, and to provide a reliable supply of water for export to the

6 City and for use in Inyo County. It also provides for mitigation of certain environmental impacts.

7 Any project that involves LADWP and groundwater pumping or utilization of groundwater

8 within Inyo County on LADWP-owned lands is subject to the provisions of the Inyo/LA Long

9 Term Water Agreement.

10 6. LADWP, as the second largest land owner in Inyo County, leases property to

11 Inyo, other government agencies, and private entities for a variety of purposes, including

12 municipal purposes. In every instance, LADWP insists on reasonable and necessary terms to

13 protect the pristine nature of the watershed and environment. LADWP does not sell or lease any

.14. real property if the proposed use is not compatible with its primary mission: to deliver reliable

15 water and power to its inhabitants. Moreover, the Los Angeles City Charter ("City Charter")

16 prohibits LADWP from selling, leasing, or otherwise disposing of the City's water rights, in

17 whole or in part, without the assent of two-thirds of the registered voters of the City voting on the

18 proposition. LADWP deploys its technical staff, as described, to monitor and report on its

19 property, whether managed as a leasehold or managed specifically by LADWP.

20 7. For more than half a century, LADWP has leased the LADWP Properties to Inyo

21 (currently by and through Inyo's Integrated Waste Management Department (*IWMD")), for

22 operation of the Bishop-Sunland Landfill, Independence Landfill, and Lone Pine Landfill (the

23 "Landfills"). The lease agreements require Inyo to manage the Landfills in a manner that

24 minimizes impacts to the Owens Valley watershed and the environment.

25 ///

26 ///

27

28 The federal government is the largest landowner in Inyo County.

1509196.1 3
PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 8. LADWP provides a reliable source of water for operational purposes at all three

2 Landfills. LADWP provides off-site well water at the Bishop-Sunland Landfill, and supplies

3 town water, at no charge, for water sourced by the Independence and Lone Pine Landfills.

4 9. LADWP has become increasingly concerned about Inyo's operation of the

5 Landfills, and its continual failure to comply with applicable law. Significantly, LADWP is

6 informed and believes that, since 1993, California's Department of Resources Recycling and

7 Recovery ("CalRecycle") and the Inyo County Department of Environmental Health Services

8 ("Inyo DEHS")which acts as the Local Enforcement Agency ("LEA")--have cited Inyo for

9 over 2,500 violations at the Landfills, including serious violations relating to the accumulation of

10 explosive gas. The Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board ("Regional Water Board")

11 has also ordered Inyo to address on-going groundwater contamination at the Bishop-Sunland

12 Landfill.

13 10. In light of Inyo's deleterious tenancy, LADWP has enhanced the environmental
14. compliance provisions in the Landfill leases to protect the Owens Valley watershed and the

15 environment. LADWP has not stated any intention to terminate the Landfill leases or otherwise

16 refused to renew the Landfill leases on reasonable terms. Indeed, LADWP and Inyo executed a

17 new lease for Bishop-Sunland Landfill on March 9, 2017, and LADWP has offered new leases for

18 the Independence and Lone Pine Landfills on similar terms.

19 11. Rather than comply with lease terms that require it to manage the Landfills in an

20 environmentally responsible manner, Inyo has initiated condemnation proceedings to acquire the

21 LADWP Properties. Inyo's decision to pursue condemnation is simply a last-ditch effort to avoid

22 operating the Landfills in accordance with required environmental conditions, thereby placing the

23 City's municipal water source at enormous risk.

24 12. In its Notice of Decision to Appraise ("Appraisal Notice") and its Notices of Intent

25 to Adopt Resolutions of Necessity (*Intent Notices"), Inyo did not (a) identify a project that

26 necessitated its initiation of condemnation proceedings; (b) adequately describe the properties it

27 intends to take; (c) specify whether it intends to attempt to acquire LADWP's groundwater rights

28 associated with the LADWP Properties--water rights which form the core supply for LADWP's

1509196.1 4

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

F municipal operations; and/or (d) disclose whether it had conducted any environmental review in

2 connection with the condemnation proceedings.

13. As to environmental review, during the hearing on the adoption of the Resolutions
of Necessity on August 15, 2017, Inyo alleged for the first time that its actions were exempt from

5 CEQA because the current landfill uses on the LADWP Properties will simply continue. Inyo's

6 a justification for a CEQA exemption is premised on its allegation that there are no plans to change

7 the use at the Landfills. Inyo's statements about future uses, however, are patently false.

8 14. LADWP is informed and believes that the true intent behind Inyo's proposed
condemnation of the LADWP Properties is to avoid environmental oversight, increase the daily

10 tonnage permitted at the Landfills, and expand other uses and operations at the LADWP

11 Properties. For example, Inyo has indicated that it intends to import waste from other counties-

12 a modification to the existing operation that will generate significant environmental impacts and

13 potentially jeopardize the municipal water supply for the City's over four million residents and

14 businesses.

'15 15. Inyo also indicated-after providing its Appraisal and Intent Notices to

16 LADWP--that it intends to acquire the groundwater rights associated with the LADWP

17 Properties as a source a of water for the Landfills. LADWP is informed and believes that this is

18 also a substantial change that is likely to have significant, potentially immitigable, environmental

19 impacts.

20 16. Inyo's failure to evaluate impacts, and its failure to properly notify LADWP and

21 the public of the true nature and scope of its "project," deprived the public and decision makers of

22 the ability to consider the project's significant environmental impacts in a meaningful way and

23 failed to demonstrate to the public that the project's impacts would be mitigated to the extent

24 feasible.

25 17. a Accordingly, LADWP seeks a writ of mandate vacating Inyo's approvals of the

26 Resolutions of Necessity for the LADWP Properties. LADWP also seeks to enjoin any further

27 approvals, funding, and any other action in furtherance of the Resolutions of Necessity pending

28 Inyo's full compliance with CEQA.

1509196.1 5
PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 PARTIES

2 18. Petitioner City is a California charter city located in the County of Los Angeles,

3 California. As provided in the City Charter, LADWP is a Proprietary Department of the City.

4 19. Respondent County of Inyo is a political subdivision of the State of California.

5 Respondent, the Inyo County Board of Supervisors ("Inyo Board") is its governing body. The

6 Inyo IWMD is a department of Inyo. Inyo has a duty to comply with CEQA and other state laws.

7 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

8 20. This Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandate to set aside Inyo's approvals

9 of the Resolutions of Necessity under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 (alternatively section

10 1094.5), and Public Resources Code section 21168.5 (alternatively section 21168).

11 21. This Court also has jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure sections 526, 527,

12 and 1094.5(g) to enjoin and stay Inyo from proceeding with any further approvals, disbursement

13 of funding, or commencement of construction activities related to the project.
14 22. Venue is proper in Inyo County Superior Court-pursuant to Code of Civil

P11 15 Procedure section 393 because the LADWP Properties are located in Inyo County.

16 23. Notwithstanding the foregoing, LADWP does not waive its right to seek a change

17 of venue by noticed motion pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 394 and 397.

18 BACKGROUND

19 24. LADWP owns, manages, and controls approximately 252,000 acres of land

20 situated in Inyo County and depends upon the water resources associated with those lands to

21 supply water and power to Inyo and to the City's over four million inhabitants.

22 25. Under the City Charter, the Board of Water and Power Commissioners has the

23 right to acquire real property in the name of the City for LADWP's purposes. (City Charter

24 § 675(d).). The City Charter also grants the Board of Water and Power Commissioners

25 possession, management, and control of all "water or water rights of every nature and kind owned

26 or controlled by the City, and all the lands, rights-of-way, sites, facilities and property used for

27 the capture, transportation, distribution and delivery of water for the benefit of the City, its

28 inhabitants and its customers." (City Charter § 672(a).) The City Charter, however, prohibits

1509196.1 6
PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 water rights owned or controlled by the City from being "sold, leased or disposed of, in whole or

2 in part, without the assent of two-thirds of the registered voters of the City voting on the

3 proposition.32 (City Charter § 673(b).)

4 A. The LADWP Properties

26. The City, acting by and through LADWP, owns the three LADWP Properties,

6 which are located in Inyo County, and on which Inyo operates the Landfills. Bishop-Sunland

7 Landfill is located at 110 Sunland Reservation Road, in Bishop, California. Independence

8 Landfill is located at 250 Dump Road, in Independence, California. Lone Pine Landfill is located

9 at 450 Substation Road, in Lone Pine, California.

10 1. Leasing of the LADWP Properties to Inyo

11 27. LADWP has leased the LADWP Properties to Inyo for operation of the Landfills

12 for over half a century.

13 28. Inyo and LADWP entered into a new three-year lease agreement for the Bishop-

14 Sunland Landfill on March 9, 2017 (*Bishop Lease"). The Bishop Lease provides Inyo with

15 rights to use approximately 118.53 acres for a Class III landfill and for no other purpose. The

16 current waste footprint of the Bishop-Sunland Landfill is 75.08 acres. Inyo is prohibited under

17 the Bishop Lease from disposing of waste outside the waste footprint. Under the Bishop Lease

18 LADWP provides Inyo access to off-site water sufficient to operate the Bishop-Sunland Landfill.

19 29. The leases for the Independence Landfill (*Independence Lease") and the Lone

20 Pine Landfill ("Lone Pine Lease") expired on June 30, 2009, and are currently in holdover status.

21 Under the Independence Lease, Inyo may use the premises (approximately 88.82 acres) as a

22 public dump site and soil borrow pit. Under the Lone Pine Lease, Inyo may only use the

23 premises (approximately 60.57 acres) as a public dump site. Inyo uses off-site water sources for

24 these two Landfills. LADWP has offered to renew the Independence and Lone Pine Leases on

25 terms similar to that of the Bisho1 Lease.

26

27 2 The City's rights in the in waters of the Los Angeles River, which date back to the founding of the Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de Los Angeles in 1781, are governed separately under subsection (a) of City Charter section 673,
28 and cannot be sold, leased, or disposed of under any circumstances,

1509196.1 7
.PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

30. Inyo currently pays only $500 per year in rent under the Independence Lease and

2 Lone Pine Lease, and $4,910 per year in rent under the Bishop Lease. These nominal amounts do

3 not cover LADWP's management costs. Moreover, they do not adequately compensate LADWP

4 for the environmental risk of allowing Inyo to operate landfills on the LADWP Properties. For

5 this reason, LADWP increased the rental payments under the Bishop Lease to require Inyo to pay

6 an annual rent of $22,637, beginning in the third year of the lease (i.e., December 1, 2018).

7 31. The parties agreed that the Bishop Lease would serve as a template for the new

8 Independence Lease and Lone Pine Lease. Instead of honoring the terms of the new Bishop

9 Lease and proceeding with lease negotiations for the Independence and Lone Pine Landfills, Inyo

10 now seeks to condemn the LADWP Properties.

11 2. Permitting and Previous Environmental Review for the Landfills

12 32. The Inyo DEHS acts as the LEA for the Landfills. It is the primary permitting and

13 enforcement agency with authority over the Landfills. The LEA issued a new permit for the

14 Bishop-Sunland-Landfill in-September. 2017. It issued permits for the Lone Pine Landfill and -- iA

15 Independence Ländfill in March and April 2000, respectively.

16 33. Inyo is required to submit a permit review application every five years. Due to the

17 significant operational changes noted in the permit review applications, in 2012, the LEA directed

18 Inyo to submit permit revision applications for all three of the Landfills.

19 34. A previous Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND") for the Bishop-Sunland

20 Landfill was filed with the State Clearinghouse (SCH #1999041076) and adopted by the LEA on

21 May 19, 1999. An addendum to the 1999 MND was prepared in October 2012.

22 35. Inyo's 2015 Independence Landfill permit revision application references an MND

23 filed in April 1999 (SCH # 96102107) and an addendum. However, the 2000 Independence

24 Landfill permit references a different CEQA document filed in June 1999 (SCH #99041075).

25 36. A 2015 permit revision application for the Lone Pine Landfill references the same

26 MND as the Independence Landfill permit revision application (SCH # 96102107) and an
27 October 2012 addendum. The 2000 Lone Pine Landfill permit references a different CEQA

28 document filed in June 1999 (SCH #99051030).

1509196.1 8

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 37. LADWP is informed and believes that none of these environmental documents

2 contemplate the condemnation actions approved by Inyo on August 15, 2017, or future expansion

3 of the Landfills.

4 B. Inyo's Regulatory Violations in Operating the Landfills

5 38. LADWP has significant concerns about Inyo's management and oversight of the

6 Landfills. For example, the Landfills are unlined and have had chronic issues with leachate and

7 gas. Groundwater at all three LADWP Properties has been impacted by Inyo's operations of the

8 Landfills. Additionally, state and local regulators continually cite Inyo for its failure to comply

9 with its Landfill permits and California law. Inyo's history of repeated violations of

10 environmental regulations is one of the factors that led LADWP to shorten the lease term in the

11 Bishop Lease to three years.

12 39. In July 2011, the Regional Water Board issued Inyo a notice of violation ("NOV*)

13 for violating the waste discharge requirements (Board Order No. 6-01-34) for the Bishop-Sunland

L': 14 Landfill. The NOV stated that, as a result of Inyols operations, volatile organic compounds

15 ("VOCs") have persisted in the groundwater for years and that, since 2008, tetrachloroethene

16 ("PCE") had been detected in excess of the maximum contaminant level. The Regional Water

17 Board directed Inyo to institute a corrective action plan to remediate the groundwater.

18 40. By letter dated April 13, 2017, the Regional Water Board notified Inyo that

19 trichloroethene ("TCE") had been detected in a previously un-impacted well. The Regional

20 Water Board informed Inyo that its corrective action plan may need to be reassessed if its

21 groundwater monitoring wells continued to show increasing concentrations and/or if VOCs were

22 detected in previously un-impacted wells.

23 41. Inyo's groundwater monitoring reports for the Independence and Lone Pine
24 Landfills also indicate the presence of low levels of VOCs from landfill gas in the groundwater.

25 Although the levels are currently below the regulatory action level; LADWP is concerned that

26 Inyo may expand or alter its landfill operations in such a manner that would increase landfill gas

27 and exacerbate this contamination, and thereby pose a threat to water quality.

28 ///

1509195.1 9

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 42. LADWP is informed and believes that, since 1993, CalRecycle and the LEA have

2 cited Inyo for over 2,500 violations at the Landfills. Violations reflected in their inspection

3 reports include, among other things, violations for the accumulation of explosive gas, failing to

4 control litter, failing to maintain site security, disposing waste outside of the landfill footprint, and

5 exceeding daily tonnages.

6 43. LADWP staff has also observed significant amounts of trash and debris scattered

7 from the Landfills onto adjacent LADWP-owned land. LADWP has informed Inyo that its

8 failure to maintain its waste facilities and to remove waste and debris from adjoining land violates

9 the Landfill leases, and has instructed Inyo to develop a waste removal plan.

10 44. Finally, since 2016 alone, Inyo has been cited for using the Bishop-Sunland

11 Landfill for two unpermitted uses. In its May 2016 inspection report, CalRecycle cited Inyo for

12 storing 35 to 40 vehicles in violation of its permit. In the July 2017 inspection report, the LEA

13 cited Inyo for an unpermitted concrete crushing operation. LADWP is informed and believes that

' ~14 wboth umpermitted uses could cause significant environmental impacts.arto woyrr.u.

15 C. Inyo's Initiation of Condemnation Proceedings

16 45. On or about March 22, 2017, Inyo sent the Appraisal Notice for the three LADWP

17 Properties. The Appraisal Notice only vaguely described the parcels that Inyo intended to

18 appraise and acquire. The Appraisal Notice did not contain information regarding Inyo's future

19 plans for the LADWP Properties or identify a project that necessitated condemnation. The

20 Appraisal Notice also failed to specify whether Inyo sought to acquire LADWP's water rights in

21 the underlying groundwater resources. Moreover, the Appraisal Notice did not state whether

22 Inyo's condemnation would impact the existing sub-lessees adjacent to, and on the same LADWP

23 Property as, the Bishop-Sunland Landfill.

24 46. On or about May 8, 2017, Inyo sent Precondemnation Offers to LADWP for the

25 LADWP Properties. The Precondemnation Offers indicated that Inyo sought to acquire full takes

26 of the LADWP Properties, not just the portions on which Inyo currently operates the Landfills

27 subject to its leases with LADWP.

28 ///

1509196.1 10
PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 47.

2 LADWP responded to the Precondemnation Offers by expressing its willingness to
negotiate with Inyo for a mutually agreeable resolution.

3 D. The Inyo Board's Hearing on Resolutions of Necessity

D 48.

5 On or about July 17, 2017, Inyo provided LADWP with Intent Notices for the
condemnation of the LADWP Properties. Similar to the Appraisal Notice, the Intent Notices did

6 not identify a project that necessitated Inyo's initiation of condemnation proceedings or

7 sufficiently describe the properties Inyo sought to take.

8 49.

9 The Intent Notices stated that the Inyo Board would decide whether to approve

10 Resolutions of Necessity at a public hearing on August 15, 2017, and that LADWP, as the
property owner, was entitled to appear and be heard upon request.

11 50.

12 On August 1, 2017, LADWP timely submitted a written request to appear and be
heard at the August 15, 2017 hearing.

13 51.

14 On August 14, 2017, LADWP submitted written objections to Inyo's proposed

15 adoption of the Resolutions of Necessity, both on CEQA grounds and under Califormia eminent

domain law.

16 52.

17 LADWP reiterated its objections, as well as its willingness to negotiate mutually

18 agreeable solutions, at the August 15, 2017 hearing on the proposed Resolutions of Necessity.

53.

19 Inyo's staff, on the other hand, argued that LADWP's new lease terms "thwart[]

20 [their] ability" to have waste from Mono County or Mammoth Lakes directed to the Landfills,

21 among other items, and recommended that the Inyo Board adopt the Resolutions of Necessity.

54.

22 Neither Inyo's staff nor its counsel provided the Inyo Board, either in the staff

23 report or at the hearing, an evaluation of the impacts of Inyo's proposed actions. Instead, during

24 the hearing, Inyo's counsel told the Inyo Board that a condemnation action would be exempt

25 under CEQA pursuant to a "common sense exemption" and as ongoing operations at an "existing

26 facility." Inyo's counsel further informed the Inyo Board that approvals made at the hearing
would authorize legal action to condemn the LADWP Properties.

27 55.

28 Over LADWP's objections, the Inyo Board approved the Resolutions of Necessity
(Resolutions No. 2017-38, 2017-39, and 2017-40) on August 15, 2017.

1509196.1 11

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 56. Each Resolution of Necessity authorized the initiation of condemnation

2 proceedings to acquire the LADWP Properties, though the scope of the take and the extent of the

3 rights sought to be taken were unclear.

4 57. Resolution No. 2017-38 recited that Inyo "intends to continue the use and

5 operation of a landfill and in connection therewith acquire interests in certain real property

6 ('the Project')." The real property proposed to be acquired pursuant to Resolution No. 2017-38

7 consists of some 118.53 acres currently owned by LADWP, the location of which is not

8 sufficiently described.

9 58. Resolution No. 2017-39 recited that Inyo "intends to continue the use and

10 operation of a landfill and in connection therewith acquire interests in certain real property

11 (*the Project')." The real property proposed to be acquired pursuant to Resolution No. 2017-39

12 consists of some 88.82 acres currently owned by LADWP, the location of which is not

13 sufficiently described.

14 59. Resolution No. 2017-40 recited that Inyo "intends to continue the use and

15 operation of a landfill . . and in connection therewith acquire interests in certain real property

16 ('the Project*)." The real property proposed to be acquired pursuant to Resolution No. 2017-40

17 consists of some 60.57 acres, the location of which is not sufficiently described.

18 60. Findings in each of the Resolutions of Necessity define the "project" as Inyo's

19 acquisition of interests in certain real property, in connection with Inyo's intended use and

20 operation of each property as a landfill. No further findings regarding the nature of the project or

21 its environmental impacts were made.

22 61. Neither the Resolutions of Necessity nor the Inyo staff report contained any CEQA

23 findings. The Inyo Board also failed to make any CEQA findings during the course of its

24 approval of the Resolutions of Necessity. Furthermore, the Inyo Board neither considered nor

25 approved any environmental document related to the proposed condemnations.

26 62. Inyo's approvals of the Resolutions of Necessity are discretionary approvals that

27 are not within the scope of any prior environmental review.

28 ///

1509196.1 12
PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 63. LADWP timely submitted detailed written objections to Inyo's proposed adoption

2 of the Resolutions of Necessity. LADWP's comments described in detail the deficiencies in

3 Inyo's environmental analysis and the lack of substantial evidence supporting Inyo's findings.

4 Those comments specifically addressed the need for CEQA compliance and the failure of Inyo to

5 provide a stable or finite project description upon which to base that CEQA compliance.

6 64. Inyo's actions at the August 15, 2017 hearing constituted approvals and
commitments to undertake the condemnation actions to acquire the LADWP Properties

8 purportedly in reliance on the CEQA common sense and existing facilities exemptions, and

9 constitute actions subject to judicial review.

10 65. Inyo's actions in approving the Resolutions of Necessity were illegal in that those

11 actions violated CEQA.

12 PROCEDURAL ALLEGATIONS

13 66. This Petition is timely filed and served in accordance with Public Resources Code

section 21167. * . he. aepa v.

15 67. LADWP has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

16 21167.5 by serving a written notice of its intention to commence this action against Inyo prior to

17 filing this action. A copy of the written notice and proof of service is attached hereto as

18 Exhibit A.

19 68. LADWP has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

20 21167.6(a) by concurrently filing its notice of election to prepare the record. of proceedings

21 relating to this action.

22 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

23 69. LADWP has performed all conditions precedent to this filing and has exhausted

24 the available administrative remedies to the extent required by law. LADWP actively

25 participated in the administrative process leading up to Inyo's approval of the Resolutions of

26 Necessity. Due to Inyo's lack of notice regarding its decision to find the condemnation of the

27 LADWP Properties exempt from CEQA review, LADWP was not required to exhaust as to

28 specific grounds for noncompliance with CEQA.

1509196.1 13
PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

- 70.

2 Irreparable harm to LADWP, the general public, and the environment will occur

3 due to the environmental impacts resulting from the project and Inyo's illegal actions in violation

4 of CEQA. LADWP has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

5 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Inyo to set aside its approval of
the project and Resolutions of Necessity.

6 STANDING

7 71.

8 LADWP has standing to assert the claims in this Petition because it holds a

9 beneficial interest in the action. LADWP's real and personal property interests, including water

10 rights associated with the LADWP Properties, will be adversely affected, both financially and
physically, by Inyo's actions.

11 72.

12• Inyo's past and on-going history of regulatory violations with respect to its

13 operation of the Landfills present a real and present threat to LADWP, and among other injuries,

14 hamper LADWP's ability to protect the Owens Valley watershed and to exercise its water rights.

15 -73:4. Further, LADWP has standing in the public interest because this case invoives:--

16 • public rights and the enforcement of public duties. Specifically, Inyo owed a mandatory duty to
comply with the procedural and substantive requirements of CEQA.

17 74.

18 LADWP, as the entity with an interest in the property being taken by Inyo, has

19 standing to challenge Inyo's approval of the Resolutions of Necessity adopted on
August 15, 2017, to acquire the LADWP Properties.

20 ATTORNEYS' FEES

21 75.

22 LADWP brings this action in the public interest, and is not seeking relief greater

23 than or different from the relief sought for the general public. If successful, this action would

24 enforce the mandates of CEQA and thus enforce the public's right to adequate environmental
review under that statute.

25 76.

26 LADWP is entitled to receive attorneys' fees from Inyo pursuant to Code of Civil

27 Procedure section 1021.5 because this action involves the enforcement of important rights

28 affecting the public interest. This action will confer a significant benefit on the general public

///

1509196.1 14

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

and a large class of persons, and the necessity and burden of enforcement against another public

2 entity makes an award of fees appropriate.
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
(Violations of CEQA, Public Resources Code, §§ 21000 et seq.)

5 77. LADWP realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs through 76 of this

6 Petition.

7 78. CEQA prohibits state and local agencies from approving public or private projects

8 that may have adverse environmental effects without first undergoing environmental review and

9 avoiding or reducing the significant environmental effects of those projects whenever feasible.

10 79. In particular, "compliance with CEQA is mandatory before a public entity may

11 condemn property for a proposed project." (City of Stockton v. Marina Towers LLC (2009) 171

12 Cal.App.4th 93, 108; see also 14 Cal. Code Regs. ("Guidelines"), § 15004(b)(1).)

13 80. The decision as to whether a project may have one or more significant effects shall

14 be based on substantial evidence in-the record of the lead agency. If the lead agency determines

15 there is substantial evidence in the record that the project may have a significant effect on the

16 environment, the lead agency shall prepare an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") (Friends of

17 B Street v. City of Hayward (1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 988).

18 81. CEQA and its informational requirements are designed to ensure that the lead

19 agency identifies all potentially significant environmental impacts of a proposed project,

20 adequately discloses those impacts to the public, and implements all feasible alternatives or

21 mitigation measures necessary to avoid or substantially lessen those impacts. (Pub. Res. Code,

22 §§ 21002, 21100; Guidelines, §§ 15126.6, 15370.) It is improper for an agency to defer its

23 analysis or the formulation of mitigation measures until after certification of the EIR and approval

24 of the project, and mitigation measures must be enforceable and contain specific performance

25 standards.

26 82. The lead agency must evaluate the environmental effects of any future expansion

27 or other future action where it is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the initial project and it

28 ///

1509196.1 15

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 will likely change the scope or nature of the initial project or its environmental effects. (Laurel

2 Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of Univ. of Cal. (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 396.)

83. The agency must also evaluate any impacts of the project that may be
"cumulatively considerable," and address the project's incremental effects when combined with

5 the effects of past, current, and probable future projects. (Guidelines, §§ 15064(h)(1), 15130(a),

6 15355.)

7 84. Noncompliance with the requirements outlined above constitutes a prejudicial

8 abuse of discretion under Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5, regardless of

9 whether a different outcome would have resulted if the lead agency had complied with those

10 requirements in the first place. (Pub. Res. Code, § 21005.) Abuse of discretion is established if

11 the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law or if the agency's determination or

12 is decision is not supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. (Pub. Res. Code,

13 §§ 21168, 21168.5.)

85. Inyo's approval of the Resolutions of Necessity for the LADWP Properties and its

15 finding that the entire condemnation proceedings to acquire the three LADWP Properties are

16 categorically exempt from CEQA review constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion in that

17 Inyo's decision is not supported by substantial evidence and presents a failure to proceed in the

18 manner required by law:

19 a. Inyo Did Not Provide an Adequate Project Description: CEQA is

20 premised on the inclusion of an accurate, stable and consistent description of the proposed

21 project. (Guidelines, § 15124.) The project description must contain specific information about

22 the project sufficient to allow a complete evaluation and review of its environmental impacts.

23 Here, the "project" is apparently the acquisition of the LADWP Properties that Inyo no longer

24 wishes to lease. LADWP alleges, on information and belief, that Inyo intends to expand and

25 modify its landfill operations at these sites, notwithstanding Inyo's long history of environmental

26 violations. LADWP's leasing relationship stands in the way of Inyo's future expansions and

27 changes in use, and so Inyo is attempting to circumvent it. This result, however, is entirely

28 inconsistent with CEQA. (San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Center v. County of Merced (2007) 149

1509196.1 16
PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Cal.App.4th 645, 655-656 ("By giving such conflicting signals to decision makers and the public

2 about the nature and scope of the activity being proposed, the Project description was

3 fundamentally inadequate and misleading.").) Inyo failed to adequately identify the "project" for
which the condemnation action was required, making it impossible for the public to adequately

5 evaluate the potential environmental impacts of Inyo's approvals. (See City of Stockton v.

6 Marina Towers LLC (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 93 ("A municipality could evade all of these

7 environmental protections by deliberately failing to define 'the project' or couching the resolution

8 in such vague language that no one could definitively determine what use the legislative body had

9 in mind for the property.").) Inyo's description of the project was inadequate because it failed to

10 discuss the anticipated future uses of the LADWP Properties. In addition, Inyo did not properly

11 identify the nature of the property interests being sought from LADWP, in particular, whether it

12 would seek to acquire LADWP's water rights in the groundwater resources underlying the

13 LADWP Properties.

14. -* *e • The Project Is Not Exempt from CEQA: Inyo improperly-determined .

15 that the entire condemnation proceedings and the project for which the condemnation action is

16 required are categorically exempt from CEQA review. The approval of the Resolutions of

17 Necessity authorizing initiating of condemnation proceedings for the LADWP Properties

18 constitutes "approval" of a "project" for purposes of CEQA. The condemnation proceedings for

19 the LADWP Properties do not qualify under the "existing facilities" exemption, "common sense

20 exemption," or any other categorical or statutory exemption. Guidelines section 15301 provides

21 an exemption for: "the operation, repair, maintenance, permitting, leasing, licensing, or minor

22 alteration of existing public or private structures, facilities, mechanical equipment, or

23 topographical features, involving negligible or no expansion of use beyond that existing at the

24 time of the lead agency's determination." (Guidelines, § 15301; but see Azusa Land Reclamation

25 Company, Inc. V. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1165 (agency's

26 decision to reopen landfill not exempt because landfill was not "structure" or "facility" and

27 addition of 3.2 million tons of waste was not a "minor alteration.").) Here, on-going violations of

28 environmental requirements and impacts to underlying groundwater resources, coupled with

1509196.1 17

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Inyo's apparent unwillingness to address those issues, point to potentially enormous future

2 environmental impacts if Inyo is allowed to carry on its operations as the sole owner of these

3 parcels without LADWP's oversight to protect the Owens Valley watershed and the City's water

4 supply. In addition, LADWP alleges, upon information and belief, that Inyo intends to modify

5 and expand operations at the Landfills in a manner that will result in new potentially significant

6 impacts.

7 C. Inyo Failed to Evaluate the Environmental Impacts of its Approvals:

8 A fair argument exists that Inyo's project will have significant impacts on the physical

9 environment. Even if subject to a categorical exemption, the condemnation and addition of waste

10 to the landfill satisfies the exceptions to the exemptions due to cumulative impacts, unusual

11 circumstances, and/or impacts to historical resources. (Guidelines, §§ 15300.2(b)-(c), (f).

12 d. Inyo's Approvals Are an Attempt to Piecemeal Environmental Review:

13 By characterizing each acquisition of property as a separate, nebulously defined "project," Inyo is

14 piecemealing environmental review, as condemnation is merely a predicate for impending

15 expansion of the Landfills and its county-wide waste management services, which is a threat to®

16 the environment. (Paulek v. Cal. Dep't of Water Resources (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 35, 45-46

17 ("It is well established that CEQA forbids 'piecemeal' review of the significant environmental

18 impacts of a project. . . . Courts have considered separate activities as one CEQA project and

19 required them to be reviewed together where, for example, the second activity is a reasonably

20 foreseeable consequence of the first activity [citation]; the second activity is a future expansion of

21 the first activity that will change the scope of the first activity's impacts [citation]; or both

22 activities are integral parts of the same project [citation].*); see also Laurel Heights Improvement

23 Ass'n, 47 Cal.3d at 396.) Inyo officials and staff have also stated that Inyo intends to modify and

24 expand its operations at the Landfills, but Inyo failed to disclose the nature of these modifications

25 or to evaluate their environmental impacts. This is inconsistent with the principle under CEQA

26 that "environmental considerations do not become submerged by chopping a large project into

27 many little ones." (Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n, 47 Cal.3d at 396.)
28 //!

1509196.1 18

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

86. Inyo had a mandatory duty to comply with CEQA prior to approving the

2 discretionary actions at issue in this Petition. Inyo's August 15, 2017 approval for the project

3 fails to comply with the requirements of CEQA and the Guidelines.

4 87. By failing entirely to engage in any meaningful review under CEQA, Inyo

5 prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed in a manner required by law.
OA Consequently, Inyo's approvals concerning the project are invalid and must be set aside.

88. LADWP reserves the right to modify, delete from, or add to this list of CEQA

8 violations after the administrative record of proceedings for the project has been fully and

9 adequately prepared, certified, and analyzed.

10 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

11 WHEREFORE, LADWP respectfully prays for the following relief:

12 1. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing Inyo to:

13 a. Vacate and set aside its approval of the three Resolutions of Necessity and

14 all related approvals; Smteals oaduwgsantem.

15 b. Comply with CEQA and the Guidelines and to take any other action as

16 required by Public Resources Code section 21168.9; and

17 C. Suspend any and all activity pursuant to Inyo's approval of the three

18 Resolutions of Necessity or in furtherance of the project, until Inyo has complied with all

19 requirements of CEQA and all other applicable laws, policies, ordinances, and regulations as are

20 directed by this Court pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21168.9;

21 2. For an injunction restraining Inyo, and all persons working on its behalf, from

22 issuing any permits or approvals or taking any other action in furtherance of the Resolutions of

23 Necessity or project that may result in a change or alteration in the physical environment pending

24 full compliance with CEQA;

25 3. For LADWP's costs of suit;

26 4. For LADWP's reasonable attorneys' fees as authorized by Code of Civil

27 Procedure section 1021.5 and other provisions of law; and

Re: Notice of Intent to File CEQA Petition
To the County of Inyo and County of Inyo Board of Supervisors:
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that, under Public Resources, Code section 21167.5, this letter
serves as written notice that the City of Los Angeles, acting by and through its Department of Water and Power (LADWP), intends to file a Petition for Writ of Mandate against the County of Inyo and the County of Inyo Board of Supervisors (together, "Inyo") under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (Pub. Res. Code, § 21000 et seq.).
The Petition challenges Inyo's actions on August 15, 2017, approving three Resolutions of Necessity (County of Inyo Resolutions 2017-38, 2017-39, and 2017-40) and authorizing the commencement of eminent domain proceedings against property owned by LADWP. A copy of the Petition for Writ of Mandate is included as Attachment A.
