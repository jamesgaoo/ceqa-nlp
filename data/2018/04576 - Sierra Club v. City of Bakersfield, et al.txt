21 INTRODUCTION

22 1.
23 SIERRA CLUB petitions this Court for a Writ of Mandate and Order under Code of

24 Civil Procedure §1094.5 and §1085, directing Respondents City of Bakersfield and Bakersfield City

25 Council ("Respondents" or the "City") to set aside the City's approval of General Plan

26 Amendment/Zone Change No. 17-0356 ("Project") and vacate the City's certification of a Mitigated

27

28 Negative Declaration/Initial Study ("MND") the City prepared and certified for the Project. Petitioner
also seeks an order directing the City not to reconsider approving the Project until and unless the City

-

2 has fully complied with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (Public

3 Resources Code §21000 et seq.).

4 II. THE PARTIES

5 2. Petitioner and Complainant, Sierra Club, a is a California non-profit membership

6 organization that is concerned with protection of the environment. Some members of the Sierra Club

7

8 reside in Bakersfield, in the vicinity of the Project. Sierra Club brings this action on its own behalf,

for its members, and in the public interest.

3.

10 Respondent and Defendant, City of Bakersfield ("City") is a local governmental agency

11 and subdivision of the State of California charged with the authority to regulate and administer land

12 use and development within its territory, but only in compliance with the duly adopted provisions of

13 its zoning ordinances, General Plan, and all applicable provisions of state law, including the California

14

15 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), the Planning and Zoning law, and the Subdivision Map Act.

4.

16 Respondent and Defendant City Council of Bakersfield ("City Council") is the

17 legislative body and highest administrative body of the City. The City Council has the authority to

18 approve, and is responsible for, amendments to the City General Plan and changes to the zoning code.

19 The City Department of Planning and Community Development is the lead agency within the meaning

20 of CEQA, but the City Council is responsible for the certification of the MND and the decision to

21 amend the General Plan and revise the zoning change. The City Council and the City of Bakersfield,

22 hereafter shall be collectively referred to as the "City" or "Respondents".

23 5.

24 are Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that Real Parties in Interest

25 Dewalt Engineering, a Bakersfield entity, and Rex Martin, who according to the MND, is the

26 owner of the property at issue here.

27 III. PROCEDURAL ALLEGATIONS

28 6. Sierra Club has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant action

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

and has exhausted any and all administrative remedies to the extent required by law, by inter alia,

2 submitting written comments expressing its opposition to the Project and pointing out the flaws in the
3 City's environmental review of the Project.
4
7.
5 Sierra Club has requested that the City not approve Project and not to certify the MND

6 therefore. Any further attempts to pursue administrative remedies would be futile.

7 8. Sierra Club has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

8 21167.5 by faxing and mailing a written notice of the commencement of this action to Respondent

9 prior to filing this petition and complaint.
10 9. Sierra Club has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
11 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 by mailing a copy of the Petition/Complaint to the
12

13 state Attorney General.

14 10. Sierra Club has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law

15 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to comply with their

16 duties and set aside the approval of the project until they have adequately complied with CEQA. In

17 the absence of such remedies, Respondents' approvals will remain in effect and in violation of CEQA.
18 11. If Respondents are not enjoined from approving the Project, and from undertaking acts
19

20 in furtherance thereof, Petitioner will suffer irreparable harm from which there is no adequate remedy

21 at law in that the project area and surrounding areas would be irrevocably altered and significant

22 adverse impacts on the environment would occur. Petitioner and the general public have also been

23 harmed by Respondents' failure to provide an environmental document that accurately and fully

24 informs interested persons of the Project's impacts.

25 12. In pursuing this action, which involves enforcement of important rights affecting the
26 public interest, Petitioner will confer a substantial benefit on the general public and citizens of
27

28 Bakersfield, Kern County, and the State of California, and therefore will be entitled to attorneys' fees

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 and costs pursuant to, inter alia, Code of Civil Procedure §1021.5.

2 13. Sierra Club brings this action in part pursuant to Public Resources Code §21168.5 and
3

4 Code of Civil Procedure §1085 or §1094.5, which require that an agency's approval of a project be set

5 aside if the agency has prejudicially abused its discretion. Prejudicial abuse of discretion occurs either

6 where an agency has failed to proceed in a manner required by law or where its determination or

7 decision is not supported by substantial evidence. Respondents have prejudicially abused their

8 discretion because Respondents have failed to proceed according to the law, and their decision is not

9 supported by substantial evidence.
10 III. STATEMENT OF FACTS
11
14.
12 The MND defines the Project as a "General Plan Amendment/Zone Change"

13 ("GPA/ZC 17-0356") on 40 acres located generally south of Chase Avenue and east of Kern Canyon

14 Road [State Route (SR) 184]. The General Plan Amendment consists of an amendment to the Land

15 Use Element of the Metropolitan Bakersfield General Plan to change the proposed site's land use

16 designation from LMR (Low Medium Density Residential), HMR (High Medium Density

17 Residential) and OS (Open Space) to LR (Low Density Residential) or a more restrictive designation.
18 The zone change consists of changing the Project site's zoning classification from R-H (Residential
19

20 Holding to R-1 (One Family Dwelling) and R-2 (Limited Multiple Family Dwelling) or more

21 restrictive districts.

22 15. The MND discloses that the proposed General Plan amendments and changes to zoning

23 classification are intended to serve real parties' ultimate objective of developing approximately 160

24 one story single-family residential (SFR) units.
25 16. The Project site consists of vacant land, surrounded by other vacant land on all sides.
26 17. The focus of Petitioner's comments during the course of the environmental review and
27

28 in this Petition is the City and MND's analysis of Project impacts on Air Quality, Climate Change and

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- Biological Resources.

2

3 Impacts on Air Quality

18.
4 San Joaquin Valley Air Quality Basin (SJVAB) is classified by the State of California

5 as being in severe nonattainment for the state 1-hour ozone standard and in nonattainment for the state

6 particulate matter less than 10 microns (PM10) and particulate matter less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5).

7

8 The SJVAB is also classified as being in extreme nonattainment for the federal 8-hour ozone standard,

9 nonattainment for federal PM2.5 ozone standard, and attainment/maintenance for the federal carbon

10 monoxide (CO) and PM10 standards. In other words, air quality in Bakersfield is among the worst in

the nation.
11
19.
12 The Project would result in criteria emission as a result of ground disturbance and other

13 construction-related activities, as well as emissions that result from the occupancy of the expected

14 housing. The operational emissions would largely result from vehicular traffic generated by the

15 occupants, as well as other emissions related to generation electricity, etc.

16 20.

17 The MND concluded that with the implementation of proposed Mitigation Measure

18 ("MM") 1 and 2, "the project would not conflict with, or obstruct implementation of, the applicable air

quality plan."
19

20 21. The MND/City imposed the following two Air Quality Mitigation Measures:

21 1. Prior to grading plan approval, the applicant/developer shall submit documentation to

22 the Planning Division that they will/have met all air quality control measures and rules required by the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District.

23

24 2. Prior to grading plan approval, the applicant/developer shall submit proof to the Planning Division that they have complied with the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution

25 Control District's ("SJVAPCD") Indirect Source Rule (Rule 9510).

22.
26 In its comments, Sierra Club argued and demonstrated that owing to the area's

27 indisputable poor air quality, the Project would result in cumulatively significant impacts on air

28 quality even if the Project's direct air quality impacts are arguably less than significant. The MND

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- and the City disagreed with Sierra Club's argument contention because, according to the MND, "the

2 project's cumulative impacts when considered with existing and future projects are below air quality
3 standards because no individual significant adverse air quality-related effects would occur as a result
4
of the project."
5

6 23. In its comments to the City, the SJVAPCD noted that based on the information

7 provided in the MND, Project emissions appeared to be below the District's thresholds of significance

8 for criteria pollutants. SJVAPCD remarked, however, that while the General Plan Amendment and

9 Zone Change in itself may not result in a significant direct impact on air quality, "future development
10 within the area with contribute to the overall decline in air quality due to increased traffic and ongoing
11 operational emissions. (Refer to responses III.a and III.b). Therefore, the project would not result in a
12

13 cumulatively considerable net increase in any criteria pollutant for which the project region is non-

14 attainment under an applicable federal or state ambient air quality standard."

15 24. The City and the MND also concluded that the Project's direct and cumulative impacts

16 on climate change would be less than significant. The MND's conclusion that the Project's cumulative

17 impact on climate change would be less than significant is based on the expected implementation of
18 MM 9, which requires the Project Developer to reduce GHG emissions by 29% in comparison to
19 2002-2004 business-as-usual (BAU).
20
25. 21 In its response to Sierra Club's comments, the City also claimed that "[b]ecause the

22 SPAL thresholds have not been exceeded, it is also assumed that GHG emissions "would not exceed

23 applicable thresholds of significance for criteria pollutants," including GHG gases and their

24 precursors."

25 26. Regarding Climate Change, MM9 provides that "prior to grading plan approval, the
26 applicant/developer shall submit documentation to the Planning Division that they will/have met the
27 Assembly Bill 32 goal of a 29% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the 2002-2004 business-
28

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

as-usual period by 2020."

2 27. The MND admits the implementation of the Project could result in significant impacts
3 on "special-status" species. These protected species include Tipton kangaroo rat, San Joaquin kit fox,
4

5 San Joaquin antelope squirrel, and Bakersfield cactus. Yet, the City did not undertake or require

6 adequate surveys of the site prior to Project implementation to detect the presence of the myriad of

7 potentially present special-status or sensitive species.

8 28.
: The Project is subject to the requirements of the Metropolitan Bakersfield Habitat

9 Conservation Plan (MBHCP), as well as Incidental Take Permit No. 2081-2013-058-04. Accordingly,
10 the Developers must pay certain fees and notify the Fish and Wildlife Service prior to grading. As the
11 MBHCP is due to expire in 2019, according to the MND, the Developers may obtain required permits
12

13 under the current HCP until 2019.

14 29. The MBHCP does not cover the burrowing owl, which is protected under the

15 Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA). Under the MBTA, it is unlawful to take, possess, buy, or sell

16 any migratory birds, feathers or other body parts of any bird species listed in the Federal Register (50

17 CFR part 21). The California Fish and Game Code prohibits the take, possession or destruction of
18 birds of prey and, their nests or eggs. The burrowing owl is listed as a species of special concern in
19
California.
20

21 30. The MBHCP likewise does not cover harm to the blunt-nosed leopard lizard (BNLL).

22 BNLL is listed as a "fully-protected" species under Fish and Game Code §6605. Under California

23 law, "take" of fully-protected species including the BNLL is strictly prohibited. According to the

24 MND, "reconnaissance-level surveys for the project determined that habitat at this site is suitable for
25 BNLL, and recommended BNLL protocol-level surveys (MBI 2017)."
26 31. The MND concluded that with the implementation of MM 3 through 5, the Project
27

28 impacts on biological resources would be reduced to a less than significant level. MM 3 requires the

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

M applicant to conduct site surveys for species covered under the MBHCP, i.e. Tipton kangaroo rat, San

2 Joaquin kit fox, San Joaquin antelope squirrel, and Bakersfield cactus. The survey is to be conducted
3 pursuant to the CDFW recommended protocol, and the applicant "shall be subject to additional
4 mitigation measures recommended by the qualified biologist." MM3 does not include any provisions

6 for public review of the survey results or mitigation recommendation. Moreover, while MM3 requires

7 copies of the survey to be provided to the Planning Division and wildlife agencies, there is no

g provision specifically allowing wildlife agencies to comment or to weigh in on the adequacy of any

9 proposed additional mitigation.
10 32. MM4 requires preconstruction surveys for burrowing owl nests. If active nests are
11 identified in any areas that could be affected by construction activities, the applicant is directed to
12

13 contact CDFW and "recommended protocols for mitigation shall be followed, and a copy of

14 mitigation protocols shall be submitted to Planning Division." MM3 does not require any mitigation

15 for loss of burrowing owl habitat or provide an opportunity for the public to review and comment on

16 the survey results.

results 17 33. MM5 requires pre-construction protocol-level surveys for BNLL. After survey
are submitted to the CDFW and Planning Division, the applicant "sha]l coordinate with CDFW on 18

19 next steps based on the results of the survey." The MND does define the word "coordinate" in this 20

21 context.

CEQA Mandates 22

23 34. CEQA was enacted to require public agencies and decision-makers to document and

24 consider the environmental implications of their actions before formal decisions are made. Public

25 Resources Code ("Pub. Res. C.") §21000, and to "[e]nsure that the long-term protection of the
26 environment shall be the guiding criterion in public decisions." Pub. Res. C §21001(d) "CEQA was
27

28 intended to be interpreted in such a manner as to afford the fullest possible protection to the

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Pm environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory authority." 14 California Code of

2 Regulations, (hereinafter cited as "CEQA Guidelines") §15003(f), citing Friends of Mammoth v,
3 Board of Supervisors, (1972) 8 Cal. 3d 247. "[T]he overriding purpose of CEQA is to ensure that
4 agencies regulating activities that may affect the quality of the environment give primary

6 consideration to preventing environmental damage. CEQA is the Legislature's declaration of policy

7 that all necessary action be taken 'to protect, rehabilitate and enhance the environmental quality of the

8 state. Save our Peninsula v. Monterey County Board of Supervisors (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 99, 117,

9 citing Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 373,
10 392; and Pub. Res. C § 21000.
11
35. The lead agency must identify all potentially significant impacts of the project and
12

13 must therefore consider all the evidence in the administrative record, not just its initial study. Pub.

14 Res. C. §21080 (c), (d), §21082.2. CEQA Guidelines direct lead agencies to conduct an Initial Study

15 to "determine if the project may have a significant on the environment." §15063(a). "All phases of

16 the project planning, implementation, and operation must be considered in the Initial Study". CEQA

17 Guidelines §15063(a)(1). Besides the direct impacts, the lead agency must also consider reasonably
18 foreseeable indirect physical changes in the environment in the area in which significant effects would
19 occur, directly or indirectly. See CEQA Guidelines §15064(d) & §15360, see, also, Laurel Heights 20

21 Improvement Assn, supra, 47 Cal. Ed at 392.

22 36. An indirect impact is a physical change in the environment, not immediately related to

23 the project in time or distance but caused indirectly by the project and reasonably foreseeable. CEQA

24 Guidelines §15064(d)(2) & §15358(a)(2). Indirect impacts to the environment caused by a project's
25 economic or social effects must be analyzed if they are "indirectly caused by the project, are
26 reasonably foreseeable, and are potentially significant." CEQA Guidelines §15064(d)-(e). A lead
27

28 agency may not limit environmental disclosure by ignoring the development or other activity that will

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

ultimately result from an initial approval. City of Antioch v. City Council (1986) 187 CA3d 1325

2 (emphasis added). Preparing a proposed negative declaration necessarily involves some degree of
3 forecasting, and the lead agency "must use its best efforts to find out and disclose all that it reasonably
4 can." See, CEQA Guidelines (15144. The guidelines specifically require that an Initial Study must

6 consider "all phases of project planning, implementation, and operation." CEQA Guidelines

7 §15063(a)(1).

8 37. Where the CEQA environmental process was procedurally or substantively defective,

9 reviewing courts may find prejudicial abuse of discretion even if proper adherence to CEQA mandates
10 may not have resulted in a different outcome. Pub. Res. Code §21005(a). For example, the Court in
11 Citizens to Preserve Ojai v. County of Ventura (1985) 176 Cal.App.3d 421, 428 held that the
12

13 certification of an EIR that had not adequately discussed the environmental impacts of the project

14 constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion even if strict compliance with the mandates of CEQA

15 would not have altered the outcome. The Court in Resource Defense Fund v. LAFCQ (1987) 191

16 Cal.App.3d 886, 897-8, went SO far as to declare that failure to comply with CEQA procedural

17 requirements was per se prejudicial. The court in Kings County Farm Bureau v. City of Hanford
18 (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692 explained that an agency commits prejudicial error if "the failure to
19

20 include relevant information precludes informed decision making and informed public participation,

21 thereby thwarting the statutory goals of the EIR process." Id., at 712.

22 38. CEQA's environmental review process is intended to provide the public with

23 assurances that "the agency has, in fact, analyzed and considered the ecological implications of its

24 actions." Laurel Heights Improvement Ass. v. Regents of the University of California (1988) 47

25 Cal.3rd 376, 392. The function of the environmental review, then, is not merely to result in informed
26 decision making on the part of the agencies, it is also to inform the public so they can respond to an
27

28 action with which they disagree. Id.

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

The "Fair Argument" Standard of Review of an Agency's Decision not to Prepare an EIR

2 39. CEQA requires lead agencies to prepare an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR")
3 whenever the approval of a proposed project may cause significant adverse effects on the
4

5 environment. Pub. Res. C. §21100. CEQA contains a strong presumption in favor of requiring

6 preparation of an EIR: even if the lead agency finds that a project may cause an impact, an EIR must

7 be prepared. Pub. Res. C. §21100, 21151; CEQA Guidelines §15064(a)(1), (f)(1). Thus, if substantial

8 evidence in the record supports a "fair argument" that the project may cause a significant impact on

9 the environment, the agency must prepare an EIR even if other significant evidence in the record
10 support the conclusion that the project will not cause a significant impact. No Oil v. City of Los
11 Angeles (1974) 13 C3d 68; see also Quail Botanical Gardens Foundation v. City of Encinitas, (1994)
12

13 29 Cal.App.4th 1597 ("Quail Botanical"), Practice under CEQA, $6.29, Kostka and Zischke (2000).

14 "The lead agency's decision is thus largely legal rather than factual; it does not resolve conflicts in the

15 evidence but determines only whether substantial evidence exists in the record to support the

16 prescribed fair argument." Friends of "B" St. v. City of Hayward (1980) 106 Cal App. 3d 988.

17 40. If, after preparing an Initial Study, the lead agency determines that the project will not
18 have a potentially significant impact on the environment, it may prepare a Negative Declaration (or
19 Mitigated Negative Declaration, or an "MND"), which must describe the reasons why in the agency's
20

21 opinion, the project will not cause any significant impacts. CEQA Guidelines §15371. As more fully

22 explained below, however, there is a strong presumption in favor of requiring the preparation of an

23 EIR because under the "Fair Argument Standard," the lead agency must prepare an EIR whenever

24 there is any substantial evidence in the record supporting a fair argument that a project may cause

25 significant environmental impacts. Laurel Heights Improvement, supra, 47 Cal. App.3d at 392.
26 41. The EIR has been described as the "heart of CEQA." CEQA Guidelines, §15003(a).
27

28 Its purpose "is to identify the significant effects on the environment of a project, to identify

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

alternatives to the project, and to indicate the manner in which those significant effects can be

2 mitigated or avoided." (Public Resources Code section 21002.1(a).) By carrying out this purpose, the
3 EIR informs "the public and its responsible officials of the environmental consequences before they
are made. Thus, the EIR "protects not only the environment but also informed self-government."

6 Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564.

7 42. The "fair argument" standard is very different from the other standards public agencies

8 are normally held to in making their administrative decisions. In virtually every other context, the
agencies weigh the evidence before them and reach a decision based on the preponderance of the
10 evidence. See, California Administrative Hearing Practice $7.51 (2d ed Cal. CEB 1997). Under the
11 fair argument standard, however, the agencies may not compare or weigh the evidence in order to
12

13 decide which side has the better argument. Rather, the agency's task is limited to the determination of

14 whether "substantial evidence" exists to support a "fair argument" that environmental impacts may

15 occur. Friends of "B" St. v. City of Hayward, supra, 106.Cal.App.3d at 1002.

16 43. Pursuant to the "fair argument" standard, a court must independently review the record
17 to determine whether there is any substantial evidence in the record to support a fair argument that a
18 significant impact may occur. Quail Botanical, supra, 29 Cal.App.4th at 1602. If the court determines
19

20 that there is substantial evidence in the record to support a "fair argument" that significant impacts

21 may occur, the existence of contrary evidence (in support of the agency's determination) is

22 insufficient to avoid an EIR because it can still be fairly argued that the project might have a

23 significant environmental impact. Friends of "B" Street v. City of Hayward, supra, 106 Cal. App. 3d

24 at 1002. CEQA allows a public agency to dispense with an EIR and prepare "negative declaration"
25 only when there appears to be no possibility that the project will actually cause significant
26 environmental impacts. Pub. Res. Code § 21080(c); CEQA Guidelines §§ 15070-15075, §15083
27

28 (emphasis added). A negative declaration is essentially a certification that the project will have no

F significant environmental effects. Citizens of Lake Murray Association y. San Diego City Council

2 (1982) 129 Cal.App.3d 436, 440.
3 44. In reviewing the agency's decision not to prepare an EIR, the court must answer a
4
question of law, which means that "deference to the agency's determination is not appropriate and its
decision not to require an EIR can be upheld only when there is no credible evidence to the contrary.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
10 (Violation of CEQA)
11 45. Petitioner refers to and incorporates herein by this reference paragraphs 1-44, inclusive,
12 of this Petition as though fully set forth herein. 13
46. The MND admits the implementation of the Project could potentially significant 14

15 impacts on Air Quality, Climate Change and Biological Resources, but concludes that with the

16 implementation of mitigation measure, the impacts would be reduced to a less than significant level.

17 47. The City concluded all potentially significant air quality impacts from the construction

18 and operation of the Project would be reduced to a less than significant level through the
19 implementation of Air Quality MM1 and MM2.
20
48. Both the City and the MND concluded that the Project's operational air quality impacts 21

22 would be reduced to a less than significant level in part because Air Quality MM2 requires the

23 applicant to comply with SJVAPCD's Indirect Source Rule ("ISR"). The ISR, however, does not in

24 itself ensure all direct project impacts on air quality are reduced to a less than significant level because

25 the ISR requires the applicant to mitigate only one half of the Project's total emissions. As such, the
26 City's conclusion that the Project's operational air quality impacts would be reduced to a less than
27 significant level through compliance with the ISR is not supported by substantial evidence or reasoned
28

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

P analysis.

2 49. The MND/City's conclusion that the Project's cumulative air quality impacts would be
3 less than significant is not based on substantial evidence and is contrary to the mandates of CEQA.
4
The MND reached this conclusion solely because the Project's criteria air emissions are estimated to 5

6 be below the SJVAPCD's thresholds of significance for direct impacts. The MND and the City failed
to adequately consider the Project's cumulative air quality impacts in light of past, present and likely

8 future projects, or in light of the San Joaquin Valley's generally abysmal air quality, or the region's

9 non-attainment status with respect to ozone, PM10, and PM2.5.
10 50. The MND and City Staff Reports repeatedly claimed that through implementation of
11 MM9, the Project "will/have met the Assembly Bill 32 goal of a 29% reduction in greenhouse gas
12

13 emissions from the 2002-2004 business as usual period by 2020." This contention/legal conclusion is

14 false and inaccurate. AB 32's stated goal is statewide reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) to 1990

15 levels by 2020. It is true that the California Air Resources Board (CARB), through its 2006 Scoping

16 Plan, concluded that achieving AB 32's GHG reduction targets would be possible if statewide

17 emissions were reduced by 29% compared to emission levels in 2002-2004. As the California

18 Supreme Court has explained, however, the Scoping Plan never claimed that AB 32's overall GHG
19 reduction goals can be met if only new individual projects achieved 29% reductions from BAU: 20

21 The Scoping Plan set out a statewide reduction goal a and a framework for reaching it-a set of broadly drawn regulatory approaches covering all sectors of the California
22 economy and projected, if implemented and followed, to result in a reduction to 1990- level greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2020. The plan expressed the overall level
23 of conservation and efficiency improvements required as, among other measures, a percentage reduction from a hypothetical scenario in which no additional regulatory 24 actions were taken. But the Scoping Plan nowhere related that statewide level of
25 reduction effort to the percentage of reduction that would or should be required from individual projects, and nothing DFW or Newhall have cited in the administrative
26 record indicates the required percentage reduction from business as usual is the same for an individual project as for the entire state population and economy.

1 ("CBD").

2 51. More specifically, the Supreme Court noted that there was no evidence or expert
3 opinion in the administrative record in that case "stating generally that the Scoping Plan contemplates
4

5 the same emission reductions from new buildings as from existing ones, or more particularly that the

6 Scoping Plan's statewide standard of a 29 percent reduction from business as usual applies without

7 modification to a new residential or mixed use development project." Id. at 227. Petitioner is

8 informed and believes and, on that basis, alleges that there is no evidence in the administrative record

9 in this case demonstrating that the Scoping Plan concluded that the statewide goal of 29% BAU can be
10 achieved retrofitting existing development.
11
52. Accordingly, the MND is inadequate as a matter of law and fails as an informational
12

13 document because it misinterprets the requirements of AB 32 and the CARB Scoping Plan.

14 53. The City abused its discretion when it concluded that with the implementation MM9,

15 the Project's impacts on climate change would be reduced to a less than significant level based on the

16 City's legal conclusion that implementation of MM9 would bring the Project into compliance with
17 AB32. As set forth above, this conclusion is based on a misreading and misapplication of AB 32 and
18 the CARB Scoping Plan. The City has not identified any substantial evidence that shows AB 32's
19

20 GHG reduction targets can be achieved if individual residential projects' emissions are reduced to

21 29% BAU.

22 54. The MND claims the City relied on the SJVAPCD's threshold and goes so far as to say

23 that "developers can use this significance threshold [29% BAU] to satisfy the concerns of the court."

24 December 6, 2017 Memo Response to Sierra Club Comments, Response to Comment 4. Contrary to

25 this contention, developers are not entitled to use any particular threshold of significance. As the lead
26 agency, it is the City's responsibility to select appropriate thresholds of significance which are
27

28 consistent with all laws and are based on substantial evidence. "When questions are raised about the

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

suitability of a particular standard [threshold of significance], the lead agency should, however, ensure
2 that is reasons for using the standard are adequately explained and supported by evidence in the
record." Practice Under Environmental Quality Act, §6.55, CEB, 2nd Ed.
4
55.
5 In response to Petitioner's comments the City also claimed that, "because the SPAL

6 [SJVAPCD's Small Project Analysis Level] thresholds have not been exceeded, it is also assumed that

7 GHG emissions "would not exceed applicable thresholds of significance for criteria pollutants,"

8 including GHG gases and their precursors." There is no substantial evidence or sound analysis

9 supporting the City's assumption that a project that does not exceed applicable thresholds of
10 significance for criteria pollutants would necessarily not cause a significant direct and/or cumulative
11 impact on climate change or not impede the achievement of the State's GHG reduction goals.
12
56.
13 The MND is legally inadequate because it fails to quantify the Project's GHG

14 emissions.

15 57. The MND fails as an informational document because it makes no effort to mention or

16 discuss SB 32 and its stated goal of reducing statewide GHG emissions by 40% by 2030. The MND

17 makes no effort to assess, for example, whether the Project would impede the achievement of SB 32's
18 GHIG emission reduction target.
19
58. The MND's analysis of impacts on sensitive biological resources, including federally
20

21 protected species, Tipton kangaroo rat, San Joaquin kit fox, San Joaquin antelope squirrel, and

22 Bakersfield cactus, as well as the burrowing owl and BNLL, was legally inadequate in that the City

23 failed to conduct any adequate or protocol level surveys. Post-approval surveys are inadequate and do

24 not satisfy CEQA's informational requirement in that they fail to adequately inform the decision-
25 makers and the public about the Project's impact on sensitive species before the project is approved.
26 Moreover, the MND fails to analyze the biological significance of the loss of habitat for these
27

28 sensitive species.

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

wd 59.

2 The MND impermissibly defers the formulation of adequate biological mitigation

3 measures in that it fails to explain why specific mitigation measures could not be devised before
project approval. Moreover, the MND fails to identify and adopt specific performance standards to

guide future mitigation of the project impacts to a less than significant level. The MND/City's

6 mitigation scheme is unlawful also because in some instances, the future mitigation measures will be

7

8 decided by the applicant's consultant and/or the Planning Division, without an opportunity for review

and input by the public or the wildlife agencies.

9 60.

10 In the case of the BNLL, MM5 requires the applicant to "coordinate with CDFW on

11 next steps based on the results of the survey." This mitigation measure is legally inadequate in that it

12 does not commit the applicant to any certain mitigation level and does not in any way establish a

13 performance standard. Moreover, it does not establish a commitment on the part of the developer to

14 implement all necessary mitigation measures to avoid take of BNLL and reduce impacts on this

15 species, including the loss of habitat, to a less than significant level.

17 WHEREFORE, SIERRA CLUB prays for judgment against the City, as set forth herein below.

18 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

19 (Failure to prepare an Environmental Impact Report)

61.
20 Petitioner refers to and incorporates herein by this reference paragraphs 1-60, inclusive,

21 of this Petition as though fully set forth herein.

22 62. As set forth above, the MND fails to adequately analyze Project impacts on Air

23 Quality, Climate Change and Biological Resources.

24 63.

25 Through its comments and in this Petition, Sierra Club has identified and established

26 substantial evidence supporting a fair argument that Project impacts on air quality, climate change and

27 biological resources would be potentially significant. The City, therefore, was required but failed to

28 prepare an EIR in order to adequately analyze the Project's impacts on the environment and consider

F adequate mitigation measures and alternatives as required by CEQA.

2 WHEREFORE, Sierra Club prays:
3 (1) That the Court issue an alternative and peremptory writ of mandate commanding
4
Respondent the City of Bakersfield and the Bakersfield City Council to set aside,

invalidate and void all approvals in connection with GPA/ZC 17-0356;

7 (2) The City set aside the MND for GPA/ZC 17-0356;

8 (3) For declaratory judgment, stating that the City's approval of GPA/ZC 17-0356 and

9 certification of an MND therefore were in violation of CEQA;
10 (4) For a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and permanent injunction
11 prohibiting any actions by Respondents pursuant to the approval of GPA/ZC 17-0356
12 until and unless Respondents have fully complied with the California Environmental 13
Quality Act, and all other applicable state, local laws and requirements 14

15 (5) For an award of costs and attorney's fee, and

16 (6) For an award of such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
