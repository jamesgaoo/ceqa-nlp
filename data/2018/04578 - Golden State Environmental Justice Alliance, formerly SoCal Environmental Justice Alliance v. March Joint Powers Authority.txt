2 INTRODUCTION

1:
3 Petitioner Golden State Environmental Justice Alliance, formerly SoCal

4 Environmental Justice Alliance ("Petitioner") challenges the Freeway Business Center

5 (*Project"), located in the County of Riverside. The proposed Project analyzed in the EIR calls

6 for the development of an approximately 709,083-square foot industrial warehouse building

7 consisting of approximately 694,083 square feet of Industrial/Warehouse development, and

8 approximately 15,000 square feet of Business development.

2.
9 The March Joint Powers Authority ("Respondent") certified the Environmental

10 Impact Report ("EIR") for the Project.

3.
11 In approving the Project, the Respondent violated provisions of CEQA requiring

12 that the EIR adequately analyze significant adverse environmental impacts. The Respondent

13 further violated the requirement that it analyze a reasonable range of alternatives, and that it

14 adopt an environmentally superior alternative. Respondent failed to adopt all feasible mitigation

15 for project impacts, and the analysis of impacts and the planned mitigation measures is uncertain

16 and is unreasonably deferred. The level of review adopted by Respondent was insufficient and

17 therefore did not allow decision makers to intelligently consider the environmental consequences

18 of the Project.

4.
19 Respondent's Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations were

20 not supported by substantial evidence in the record. The Statement of Overriding Considerations

21 was improperly adopted when feasible mitigation measures and alternatives existed to lessen

22 significant project impacts.

23

24 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5.
25 This Court has jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and

26 1094.5 and for declaratory relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 1060. The Court has

27 jurisdiction of CEQA matters pursuant to Pub. Resources Code sections 21168, 21168.5, and

21168.9.
28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 2

H

2
6.
3 Venue is proper in this Court because the Respondent and Project are located in

4 Riverside County and the actions giving rise to the causes of action herein transpired in

5 Riverside County. See Code of Civil Procedure §§ 393 and 394.

7.
6 This action is timely filed within 30 days of the posting of the Notice of

7 Determination under CEQA.

8.
8 Petitioner has exhausted its administrative remedies by commenting on the

9 Project prior to the close of the public hearing on the Project in compliance with Public

10 Resources Code section 21177(b).

9.
11 Petitioner has complied with CEQA by filing and serving with this Petition for

12 Writ of Mandate a Notice to the MJPA of Intent to File pursuant to Pub. Resources Code section

13 21167.5, a Notice to Attorney General of Commencement of Action pursuant to Pub. Resources

14 Code section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388, and a Notice of Commencement

15 of Action to Responsible Agencies pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6.5.

16
PARTIES
17
10.
18 Petitioner Golden State Environmental Justice Alliance, formerly SoCal

19 Environmental Justice Alliance, ("Petitioner") is a California not for profit corporation devoted

20 to the preservation of the environment as well as the promotion of safe and healthy communities.

21 It is a corporation formed and operating under the laws of the State of California. Members of

22 Petitioner are taxpayers who reside in or near Riverside County and would be irreparably harmed

23 by the Project's environmental impacts and have an interest in ensuring open, accountable, and

24 responsive government and in protecting the region's environment. Petitioner and its members

25 submitted comments on the Project, bring this action on behalf of the public, and are acting as

26 private attorneys general conferring significant benefit on the general public or a large class of

27 persons under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.

11.
28 Respondent March Joint Powers Authority ("Respondent") is a public entity

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 3

1 located in Riverside County and the lead agency for the Project under CEQA. Respondent is the
2 agency charged with regulating and administering land use and development within its territory
3 in compliance with the provisions of its General Plan and zoning ordinances as well as
4 applicable provisions of state law including CEQA. As the lead agency for the Project,
5 Respondent has the duty to ensure compliance with these applicable laws. Respondent is
6 authorized and required by law to hold public hearings, to determine whether CEQA applies to
7 development within its jurisdiction, to determine the adequacy of and certify environmental
8 documents prepared pursuant to CEQA, and to determine whether a project is compatible with
9 the objectives, policies, general land uses, and programs specified in the General Plan.
10
12. Real Party In Interest Proficiency 215, LLC is the applicant for the Project and is
11 therefore served as Real Party in Interest pursuant to Public Resources Code section
12 21167.6.5(a). Proficiency 215, LLC is a Delaware limited liability company that is located and
13 does business in the County of Los Angeles, State of California.
14
13. The true names and capacities of the Respondents and Defendants identified as
15 1 DOES 1 through 100, and of the Real Parties in Interest identified as DOES 101 through 200 are
16
unknown to Petitioner, who will seek the Court's permission to amend this pleading in order to
17 allege the true names and capacities as soon as they are ascertained. Petitioner is informed and
18 believes and on that basis alleges that the fictitiously named Respondents and Defendants
19 through 100 have jurisdiction by law over one or more aspects of the Project that is the subject
20 of this proceeding; and that each of the fictitiously named Real Parties in Interest 101 through
21 200 either claims an ownership interest in the Project or has some cognizable interest in the
22
Project.
23

24 STATEMENT OF FACTS AND COMMON ALLEGATIONS
25 14. Petitioner opposes the Project and challenges certain actions taken by
26 Respondent. In particular, Petitioner seeks to invalidate the approvals with respect to the Project
27 on the grounds that Respondent has violated CEQA, the Planning and Zoning Law, and other
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 4

1
laws.
2 15. Petitioner seeks review by and relief from this Court under Public Resources
3 Code Section 21168 or 21168.5 as applicable; and Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1060 et seq.
4 and 1084 et seq., among other provisions of law.
5
16. Petitioner has satisfied all exhaustion-of-remedies requirements to maintain this
6 proceeding. By way of example and without limitation, Petitioner submitted written opposition
7 to the Project during the administrative proceedings for the Project.
8
17. Alternatively, and additionally, neither Public Resources Code Section 21177(a)-
9 (b) nor any other exhaustion-of-remedies requirement may be applied to Petitioner.
10
18. Respondent's conduct in approving the Project without complying with CEQA
11 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion because, as alleged in this pleading, it failed to
12 proceed in the manner required by law and made findings not supported by substantial evidence.
13
19. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of
14 law, since its members and other members of the public will suffer irreparable harm as a result of
15 Respondent's violations of CEQA and other laws. Respondent's approval of the Project also
16 rests on the failure to satisfy a clear, present, ministerial duty to act in accordance with those
17 laws. Even when Respondent is permitted or required by law to exercise its discretion in
18 approving projects under those laws, it remains under a clear, present, a ministerial duty to
19 exercise its discretion within the limits of and in a manner consistent with those laws.
20 Respondent has had and continues to have the capacity and ability to approve the Project within
21 the time limits of and in a manner consistent with those laws, but Respondent has failed and
22 refused to do so and has exercised its discretion beyond the limits of and in a manner that is not
23 consistent with those laws.
24
20. Petitioner has a beneficial right and interest in Respondent's fulfillment of all its
25 legal duties as alleged in this pleading.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 5

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
2
Failure to Prepare Adequate Environmental Impact Report
3
(Against all Respondents and Real Parties in Interest)
4 21. Paragraphs 1 through 20 are fully incorporated into this paragraph.
5
22. CEQA requires that every environmental impact report identify and analyze the
6 significant adverse environmental impacts of a proposed project, giving due consideration to
7 both short term and long term impacts, providing decision makers with enough information to
8 enable them to make an informed decision with full knowledge of the likely consequences of
9 their actions, and providing members of the public with enough information to participate
10 meaningfully in the project approval and environmental review process. CEQA also requires
11 that every environmental impact report identify and analyze a reasonable range of alternatives to
12 a proposed project. CEQA further requires that every environmental impact report identify and
13 analyze all reasonable mitigation measures for a proposed project 's significant adverse
14 environmental impacts. In each respect, CEQA mandates that the analyses contained in an
15 environmental impact report and all decisions of the lead agency based on the report be
16 supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record.
17
23. The Project's EIR fails to provide adequate identification and analysis of the
18 significant adverse environmental impacts of the Project. Further, neither the analysis of impacts
19 in the Project's EIR nor Respondent's certification of the EIR in this respect is supported by
20 substantial evidence in the administrative record.
21 24. The EIR is inadequate in ways that include, but are not limited to, those described
22 below.
23 Project Location
24
25. The Project is proposed for two parcels, one of which, 6.2 acres, is zoned RR
25 (rural-residential). It requires a General Plan Amendment to change the designation of this
26 parcel, which was formally incorporated as part of the Joint Powers Authority in 2015. There is
27 also a Plot Plan for developing these parcels with a 709,083 square-foot building, of which a
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 6

15,000 square feet would be office space and the remainder industrial. Several utility lines
2 would need relocating. Respondent states that an end user has not been identified so Respondent
is "assum[ing] a variety of industrial functions within the building, consistent with the
4 opportunities and limitations associated with the Project site as outlined herein." Respondent
5 said no more about this. Given that the site could be used as a distribution center as a worst case,
6 Respondent should have analyzed this outcome. Respondent's basis for concluding that only
7 22.9% of the trucks would be four-axle trucks is questionable. Respondent's failure to use these
8 higher, more representative numbers infects Respondent's traffic analysis, air quality analyses,
9
and health risk assessment.
10
Traffic
11
26. Respondent assumes only 38.1% of trips would be truck trips and disclosed the
12 trip generation rate as 1.68 per thousand square feet. The South Coast Air Quality Management 13 District ("SCAQMD") states that an overall trip generation rate of 1.44 is not likely to be based 14 on substantial evidence and that 2.59 is a reliable default value. SCAQMD recommended a
15

16 minimum truck ratio of 40%, and there have been numerous studies with numbers higher than

that.
17 Air Quality
18
27. The EIR's health risk assessment ("HRA") prepared by Urban Crossroads,
19 located in Appendix B states that the analysis relies upon guidance from the Office of
20 Environmental Health Hazard Assessment ("OEHHA"), the organization responsible for 21 providing recommendations and guidance on how to conduct health risk assessments in
22 California (Appendix B, pp. 96). OEHHA's most up to date guidance recommends use of
23 adjustments for early-life exposure to carcinogens in risk calculations for specific age groupings
24 that incorporate several age specific factors in the cancer risk calculations. The Project's HRA
25 makes note of this, yet states that use of these age adjustment factors is not appropriate for the
26 proposed Project. The HRA references the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's ("EPA") 27 Supplemental Guidance for Assessing Susceptibility from Early-Life Exposure to Carcinogens 28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 7

1 report, which states that age sensitivity factors ("ASFs") should only be applied to pollutants
2 which "elicit a primary mutagenic mode of action" and determines that because "none of the
3 Project's pollutants elicit a primary mutagenic mode of action... the use of age specific
4 adjustment factors is not warranted" (Appendix B, pp. 96). Specifically, the HRA states,
5 "A review of relevant guidance was conducted to determine applicability of the
6 use of early life exposure adjustments to identified carcinogens. For risk
7 assessments conducted under the auspices of The Air Toxics "Hot Spots"
8
Information and Assessment Act of 1987 (AB2588), OEHHA applies specific
9 adjustment factors to all carcinogens regardless of purported mechanism of
10 action. However, the study relied upon U.S. EPA guidance relating to the use of
11 early life exposure adjustment factors (Supplemental Guidance for Assessing
12 Susceptibility from Early-Life Exposure to Carcinogens, EPA/630/R-003F)
13 whereby adjustment factors are only considered when carcinogens act "through
14 the mutagenic mode of action." A mutagen is a physical or chemical agent that
15 changes genetic material, such as DNA, increasing the frequency of mutations to
16 produce carcinogenic effects. The use of adjustment factors is recommended to
17 account for the susceptibility of producing adverse health effects during early life
18 stages from exposure to these mutagenic compounds. None of the carcinogens
19 considered in the study for this Project elicit a mutagenic mode of action and,
20 therefore, the use of age specific adjustment factors is not warranted. The study
21 correctly used a lifetime exposure adjustment factor of 1.0" (Appendix B, pp. 96).
22
28. However, following this conclusion, the EIR's HRA subsequently states that the
23 Project's health risk impact has been evaluated using the 2015 OEHHA Guidelines in order to
24 assess if the Project would result in a significant health-related impact. The HRA states,
25 "Notwithstanding, although not required by CEQA, the Project's potential health
26 risks have been evaluated under the 2015 OEHHA Guidelines to determine if any
27 additional impacts would occur. Consistent with the 2015 OEHHA Guidelines,
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 8

T the exposure duration was revised from 70 years to 30 years for the residential
2 scenario and 40 years to 25 years for the worker scenario. Additionally, m v applicable ASFs and breathing rates consistent with 2015 OEHHA Guidelines
were applied. Results of the HRA if the 2015 OEHHA Guidelines were utilized
5 are presented in Section 2.9 of this report" (Appendix B, pp. 97).
6
29. As shown above, the HRA definitely states that "applicable ASFs and breathing
7 rates consistent with 2015 OEHHA Guidelines were applied" when calculating the Project's
8 potential health risk impact. In order to verify use of these age specific adjustment factors, we
9 reviewed Section 2.9 of the HRA and found that there was no clear evidence to suggest that these 10 adjustment factors were in fact used to calculate the Project's excess cancer risk. Furthermore,
11 according to the report, detailed risk calculations were contained in Appendix 2.2., however,
12 these calculations were not included in the attachments, nor were they available online. By
13 failing to provide this information, we are unable to verify the accuracy of the HRA and are 14 unable to determine if the Project's health risk impact was properly evaluated. As a result, the 15 adequacy of the HRA provided in the EIR is questionable. Until additional clarification and
16 supporting information is provided, this HRA should not be relied upon to determine Project
17
significance.
18
30. Despite the HRA's assertions that age specific adjustment factors are not
19 appropriate for the proposed Project, the omission of early life exposure adjustments when
20 calculating health risk has been shown to underestimate the lifetime exposure cancer risk for
21 many carcinogens. In its Technical Support Document for Cancer Potency Factors report, the
22 Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment's (OEHHA) Air Hotspots Program
23 determined that the lifetime cancer potency for carcinogens is underestimated when early-life
24 susceptibility is not included in modeling, and therefore recommends the use of specific
25 adjustment factors to account for third trimester fetuses, infants and children's increased
26 sensitivity to carcinogens, regardless of the mode of action. Furthermore, in response to the
27 recommendations made in the U.S. EPA's Supplemental Guidance for Assessing Susceptibility 28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 9

1 from Early-Life Exposure to Carcinogens report regarding application of default age-adjustments
2 to only mutagenic carcinogens, the EPA Science Advisory Board ("SAB") made the following
3
recommendation:
4 "Certain groups of non-mutagenic carcinogens with known modes of action serve
5 as important examples in support of applying a default factor to non-mutagenic
6 carcinogens when the mode of action is unknown. The Review Panel suggests
7 that the Agency reconsider limiting the application of adjustment factors only to
8 mutagenic agents and instead apply a default approach to both mutagenic and to
9 non-mutagenic chemicals for which mode of action remains unknown or
10 insufficiently characterized."
11 31. As demonstrated above, the SAB recommends applying adjustment factors to
12 carcinogens, regardless of the mode of action. As such, the HRA should have been conducted
13 using early life adjustment factors to accurately assess the Project's health risk impact. The
14 Project's potential health risk impact has been inadequately evaluated, as the EIR fails to provide
15 enough evidence to support the conclusion that the Project would not result in a significant
16 health related impact. The HRA concludes that the health risk posed to nearby sensitive
17 receptors as a result of emissions generated by the proposed Project would be less than
18 significant; however, the EIR fails to provide the calculations used to reach this conclusion.
19 Furthermore, the Project's HRA makes it unclear as to whether age-specific adjustment factors
20 were used to estimate the Project's cancer risk. As a result, we cannot fully understand the
21 methods and assumptions used to estimate the Project's total cancer risk and cannot verify the
22 accuracy of the HRA. Until the calculations used to estimate the Project's cancer risk are
23 provided, the Project should not be approved.
24
32. At page 4.2-15 Table 4.2-3, Ambient Air Quality Data, it appears Respondent
25 listed fractions of exceedances for the State PM10 standard for 2012 and 2014. As to Threshold
26 AQ-1: Would the Project conflict with or obstruct implementation of the applicable air quality
27 plan?, at first Respondent says no, then Respondent says yes. As Respondent noted, SCAQMD
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 10

1 Consistency Criterion No. 1.is whether the Project will result in an increase in the frequency or
2 severity of existing air quality violations or cause or contribute to new violations or delay the
3 timely attainment of air quality standards. Respondent concedes that the Project, on its own,
will. Respondent concedes that Respondent's Mitigation Measures ("MMs") AQ-1 and AQ-3
through -8 would reduce NOx impacts, but not to below the level of significance. Respondent
6 argues that Respondent meets Consistency Criterion No. 2, whether the proposed Project would
7 exceed the assumptions in the AQMP, on the ground that Respondent's Project would represent
8 a small part of the overall job projections by the Southern California Association of
9 Governments ("SCAG"). Petitioner disagrees, as SCAQMD intended that Respondent evaluate
10 consistency with the applicable General Plan in assessing consistency with Criterion No. 2, and
11 Respondent is not consistent with respect to the second, 6.2 acre, parcel, which is zoned rural-
12 residential. Respondent ultimately concluded that the Project violates the threshold, even though
13 Respondent initially stated that it did not.
14
33. With respect to Threshold AQ-2: Would the Project violate any air quality
15 standard or contribute substantially to an existing or projected air quality violation?,
16 Respondent concedes the impacts are significant and unavoidable with respect to NO% and VOCs
17 for construction and NOx for operation. As to construction, Respondent claims fugitive dust
18 would be reduced by 61% under Respondent's calculations in CalEEMod assuming Respondent
19 is watering the site 3 times a day, but Respondent's mitigation measure only calls for watering
20 twice a day, and other projects have been seen with emissions only reduced 45% to 52% by
21 watering. As to operation, Respondent's assumptions are disputed regarding trip assignment in
22 that Respondent only follow the trucks until they get to exit points for the South Coast Air Basin
23 (*SCAB") in a number of instances, such as the San Gorgonio Pass, the Cajon Pass, and the San
24 Diego County line. These trips should have been concluded at other major distribution centers or
25 natural endpoints.
26 34. Threshold AQ-3 asks Would the Project result in a cumulatively considerable net
27 increase of any criteria pollutant for which the Project region is non-attainment under an
28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 11

1 applicable federal or state ambient air quality standard (including releasing emissions which
2 exceed quantitative thresholds for ozone precursors)? Here Respondent limits the analysis of
3
cumulative impacts to NOx, apparently relying on SCAQMD guidance that Respondent can do
4 so because only impacts that are individually significant are cumulatively significant. This
5 defies numerous CEQA Guidelines and the statute and is not based on substantial evidence.
6 Public Resources Code § 20183(b)(2) defines cumulative impacts to mean "that the incremental
7 effects of an individual project are considerable when viewed in connection with the effects of
8 past projects, the effects of other current projects, and the effects of probable future projects."
9 Inherent in a cumulative impacts analysis is whether an impact is significant when combined
10 with the effects of other past, present, and future projects. This is borne out by the Guidelines.
11

12 Guidelines § 15130(a)(1) provides "As defined in Section 15355, a cumulative impact consists of
an impact which is created as a result of the combination of the project evaluated in the EIR
13 together with other projects causing related impacts." (emphasis supplied). Guidelines §
14 15064(h)(1) provides:
15 When assessing whether a cumulative effect requires an EIR, the lead agency will
16 consider whether the cumulative impact is significant and whether the effects of the
17 project are cumulatively considerable. An EIR must be prepared if the cumulative impact
18 may be significant and the project's incremental effect, though individually limited, is
19 cumulatively considerable. "Cumulatively considerable" means that the incremental
20 effects of an individual project are significant when viewed in connection with the effects
21 of past projects, the effects of other current projects, and the effects of probable future
22
projects.
23 Guidelines § 15064(h)(1) (emphasis supplied).
24 Guidelines § 15065(a)(3) requires a mandatory finding of significance when "The project
25 has possible environmental effects that are individually limited but cumulatively
26 considerable," and provides the same definition of "cumulatively considerable."
27 Finally, Guidelines § 15355 defines cumulative impacts and states:
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 12

F "Cumulative impacts" refer to two or more individual effects which, when considered
2. together, are considerable or which compound or increase other environmental impacts.
3 (a) The individual effects may be changes resulting from a single project or a
4 number of separate projects.
5 (b) The cumulative impact from several projects is the change in the environment
6 which results from the incremental impact of the project when added to other
7
closely related past, present, and reasonably foreseeable probable future projects.
Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant
projects taking place over a period of time.
10 Guidelines $ 15355 (emphasis supplied). See also Gordon & Herson, "Demystifying CEQA's
11 Cumulative Impact Analysis Requirements: Guidance for Defensible EIR Evaluation," Cal.
12 Env't'1 L. Reporter, 379, 381 (Sept. 2011) (Vol. 2011, Issue 9) ("Critically, a proposed project's
13 incremental effects may be 'cumulatively considerable' even when its individual effects are 14 limited. (citations). In other words, CEQA does not excuse an EIR from evaluating cumulative
15 impacts simply because the project-specific analysis determined its impacts would be less than
16 significant." Respondent's cumulative impacts analysis is wholly without a basis in substantial
17 evidence and represents a failure to proceed by law.
18
35. Respondent also does no assessment of the cumulative impacts even with respect
19 to NO, emissions - Respondent simply stated that the impacts will be cumulatively
20 considerable. There are numerous planned and existing high-cube and other warehouse
21 projects, many in the immediate vicinity, which will lead to increased emissions of NOx and
22 DPM. These include Alessandro Commerce Centre, the ProLogis Distribution Center in
23 Moreno Valley, the Sycamore Canyon Business Park, the Moreno Valley Logistics Center, the
24 Indian Street Commerce Center, and the massive World Logistics Center, and several recently
25 built projects including the Aldi Distribution Center, the Deckers Outdoor Distribution Center
26 and the Amazon Fulfillment Center in Moreno Valley.
27 36. While some of these projects may have made it onto Respondent's cumulative
28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 13

I projects list, Respondent has not assessed the additional emissions from those Projects as they
2 impact Respondent's construction or operation emissions.
m v 37. Threshold AQ-4: Would the Project expose sensitive receptors to substantial
pollutant concentrations? Here Respondent says the closest sensitive receptors are residences 5 located 755 feet away to the northeast. In Table 4.2-9 Respondent says they are 775 feet away. 6 When Respondent addressed noise, Respondent indicated that they were only 750 feet away. 7 This is not consistent. Respondent also assessed LSTs on two elementary schools, Edgemont 8 Elementary and TownGate Elementary, though Respondent does not address how far they are 9 away, which is critical information for Respondent's health risk assessment. For construction,
10 Respondent exceeds LST thresholds by nearly four times at the residences for NO2, and
11 significantly for PM10 and PM2.5. Respondent also exceed the NO2 threshold regarding the
12 schools. Apparently, Respondent had to do this modeling because Respondent exceeded the
13 LST mass daily thresholds in the lookup tables. Respondent should have disclosed this to the 14
public.
15 38. Concerning Respondent's Health Risk Assessment, Respondent failed to conduct
16 one regarding construction emissions. Respondent also failed to conduct a proper assessment
17 regarding operation because Respondent did not assess risks to infants or children. California
18 Air Resources Board ("CARB") findings regard that DPM is mutagenic. CARB recommends 19 not siting distribution center uses particularly distribution centers involving TRUs - within
20 1,000 feet of sensitive receptors, including residences.
21
39. Regarding Respondent's mitigation measures, for construction Respondent has 22 MM AQ-2 for dust control during construction. This only provides for watering twice while 23 Respondent's modeling assumed Respondent would water three times a day minimum. It also
24 says action will be taken within 4 hours of a complaint regarding inadequate dust suppression. 25 This should be at a maximum one hour.
26
40. MM AQ-3 provides that Respondent will have the tenant file an annual Traffic
27 Demand Management Plan to "encourage" at least 30% of workers to carpool, use transit or ride
28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 14

1 bicycles to the site. There is nothing mandatory about this plan, other than filing it annually,
2 and there is no substantial evidence this will work to achieve anywhere near 30% carpooling,
3 bicycle and transit use. Moreover, this makes no dent in NOx emissions, which comes
primarily from the truck traffic to the site.

41. MM AQ-4 provides for electrification at the bays for TRUs. Respondent could
6 just as easily have provided for electrification to power electric and hybrid electric trucks.
7
42. MM AQ-7 limits idling time to 5 minutes and provides for signage. That signage
8 should reflect that idling over 5 minutes violates CARB regulations.
9 43. Additional limitations Respondent could have included but did not would be (1)
10 to limit the number of trucks entering the site any day to the number evaluated in the EIR
11 (particularly since Respondent has severely underestimated that number), (2) to require EPA
12 Model 2010 or later trucks, (3) locate food options and refueling capability on site to prevent
13 trucks from traversing past residences, (4) providing for minimum percentage of alternatively
14 fueled trucks such as CNG trucks to frequent the site, and (5) to require LEED certification of 15 the building.
16 Greenhouse Gas ("GHG") Emissions
17 44. Respondent concedes GHG emissions will be significant. However, Respondent
18 relies on SCAQMD's threshold for review of its own stationary source projects. This is neither a
19 SCAQMD-permitted project nor a stationary source. If Respondent were going to adopt a
20 SCAQMD standard it should be the SCAQMD Working Group standard for land use projects at
21 3,000 MTCO2e. Also, Respondent calculates construction emissions at 3,600 MTCO2e, and
22 then amortizes them over 30 years. Amortizing them over 30 years runs contrary to the goals of
23 AB32, and Executive Orders S-3-05 and B-30-15.
24
45. Regarding the Project's compliance with regional and local GHG initiatives,
25 Respondent should have compared the Project to the goals in the Riverside County draft Climate
26 Action Plan. Regarding mitigations, it is entirely feasible to require LEED certification of the
27 building.
28

Biological Resources
2
46. • The only site visits Respondent's biological consultant made to the site, 3 apparently, were on February 10, 2014 and January 6, 2015. This was not the time to detect rare 4

5 plants or birds during the breeding season, yet Respondent's Tables 4.3-2 and 4.3-3 indicate they
are "absent," with no basis in substantial evidence. Two site visits of a roughly 40-acre site
6 simply cannot detect all rare species that may be present on the site. With respect to the San 7 Diego Ambrosia, the loggerhead shrike, the Oregon vesper sparrow, Respondent simply stated
8 the species are absent because they were not observed. Similarly, regarding the American 9 badger, the Los Angeles pocket mouse, the northwest San Diego pocket mouse, the pallid San 10 Diego pocket mouse, the San Bernardino kangaroo rat, and the southern grasshopper mouse, 11 Respondent simply stated they were not found. Respondent's biologist also stated later in the 12 EIR that these species had the potential to occur, although Respondent marked them absent: the
13 Stephens kangaroo rat ("SKR"), the burrowing owl, the golden eagle, the white-tailed kite, the
14 northern harrier, the loggerhead shrike, the Oregon vesper sparrow, the Vaux' s swift, the yellow 15 warbler and the western mastiff bat.
16
Land Use and Planning
17
47. The Project is not consistent with the General Plan because it requires an 18 amendment. Additionally, Respondent undertook to compare the Project to several General Plan 19 Policies, but left out a few significant ones listed below, and assessing consistency with others 20 improperly:
21
Land Use Element
22 Policy 2.4 Protect the interests of, and existing commitments to adjacent 23 residents, property owners and local jurisdictions in planning land uses: 24 Respondent has not taken the considerations of adjacent residents and schools into 25 consideration. Cumulatively with other warehouse projects the impacts upon them 26 will be significant.
27 Noise/Air Quality Element
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 16

Goal 3 - Reduce air pollution through proper land use, transportation and energy 2. use planning: Respondent says is consistent, however, Respondent already
3 conceded the Project on its own will lead to air quality violations.
4 Policy 3 .1 - Locate ancillary uses within businesses and employment centers to
5 reduce the number of vehicle trips and lessen vehicle miles traveled. 6 Policy 3.4 Encourage ride-sharing programs while Respondent says
7 Respondent will develop an alternative transportation program for 30% of the
8 Project's workers it contains no mandatory elements and there is no assurance it
9 will have anywhere near this level of success.
10 Policy 5.5 - Review development project to determine the potential air quality 11 impacts and provide appropriate mitigation, where necessary - it is necessary 12 here.
13 Goal 6 Reduce emissions associated with vehicle engine use - Respondent has 14 not mitigated NOx emissions to any significant degree.
15 Policy 6.2 Work with Riverside Transit Agency to develop a local transit system 16 and facilitate connections - Respondent apparently has had no discussions with 17 RTA regarding service to the Project site.
18 Policy 6.3 - Encourage the diversion of peak hour truck traffic, whenever feasible
19 Respondent says to follow the provision because Respondent has imposed traffic 20 mitigations. This is different than discouraging peak hour truck traffic.
21 Policy 6.8 Encourage the use of compressed natural gas, clean diesel, and/or 22 alternative fuels in engines - Respondent says Respondent is consistent because
23 Respondent has provided for preferred parking for alternatively fueled passenger 24 vehicles. The vast majority of emissions from the Project will come from trucks 25 and Respondent has done nothing to assure any percentage of alternatively fueled 26
trucks coming to the site.
27 Policy 8.2 Encourage the separation of sensitive receptors, such as schools and 28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 17

uA0 NI hospitals, from toxic emissions - the Project is less than 1,000 feet from existing
residences. Whether those residences are zoned for their location (and they may
have preexisted the present zoning), the Project impacts them.
Goal 9 Reduce fugitive dust and particulate matter emissions

6 Cumulative Impacts

48.
7 Respondent should have evaluated impacts from reasonably foresecable future

8 projects such as the Alessandro Commerce Centre, the ProLogis project, the World Logistics

9 Center, the Moreno Valley Logistics Center, and the Indian Street Commerce Center.

10 Respondent does not appear to have included all of these and have not evaluated the air quality

11 impacts from them.

12 Project Alternatives

49.
13 Additionally, and alternatively, the Project's EIR fails to provide adequate

14 identification and analysis of a reasonable range of alternatives to the Project. Neither the

15 analysis of alternatives in the EIR nor Respondent's certification of the EIR in this respect is

16 supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record.

50.
17 CEQA requires that an EIR consider a "reasonable range of alternatives,"

18 Guidelines § 15126.6(a), and that the document must include a discussion of alternatives even if

19 to some degree they would limit accomplishment of the project's objectives, or would be more

20 costly. Guidelines § 15126.6(b).

51.
21 Respondent failed to adequately identify, analyze, and consider alternatives that

22 lessened the Project's impacts. The CEQA Guidelines mandate that "The range of potential

23 alternatives to the proposed project shall include those that could feasibly accomplish most of the

24 basic objectives of the project and could avoid or substantially lessen one or more of the

25 significant effects." Guidelines § 15126.6(c).

52.
26 Additionally, and alternatively, the Project's EIR fails to provide adequate

27 identification and analysis of measures to mitigate the Project's significant adverse

28 environmental impacts and fails to eliminate or substantially eliminate all such impacts. Neither

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 18

1 the analysis of mitigation measures nor Respondent's certification of the EIR in this respect is 2 supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record.
3
53. CEQA requires an agency to adopt feasible mitigation measures that will
4 substantially lessen or avoid the Project's potentially significant impacts and to describe those 5 mitigation measures in the EIR. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002, 21081(a), 21100(b)(3); Guidelines 6

7 15126.4. A lead agency may not conclude that an impact is significant and unavoidable
without requiring the imposition of all feasible mitigation measures to reduce impacts to less 8 than significant levels. Guidelines §8 15126.4, 15091.
9
54. CEQA also requires that an agency must adopt a "statement of overriding 10 considerations" for any significant effects which have not been mitigated to a level of 11 insignificance by mitigation measures or the adoption of alternatives. The agency must find 12 "that specific overriding economic, legal, social, technological, or other benefits of the project 13 outweigh the significant effects on the environment." Pub. Res. Code § 21081(b). The 14 statement of overriding considerations must be based on substantial evidence in the record. Pub.
15 Res. Code § 21081.5; Guidelines § 15093(b).
16
55. Respondent adopted the statement of overriding considerations when feasible 17 mitigation measures and project alternatives existed, in violation of CEQA. Pub. Res. Code 18 § 21081; Guidelines § 15092. Respondent also failed to make all required written findings 19 regarding the Project's impacts. Respondent also approved the Project based on one or more 20 written findings that there exist considerations outweighing the Project's significant adverse 21 environmental impacts, but there is not substantial evidence in the administrative record to
22 support all such findings. Moreover, Respondent approved the Project based on one or more
23
non-written findings that such considerations exist.
24
56. As a result of Respondent's violations of CEQA, Petitioner has been harmed in
25 that the decision makers who approved the Project were not fully informed about the impacts of 26 mitigation measures for and alternatives to the Project prior to its approval, and the Petitioner 27

28 and the public will have to endure significant, avoidable, unmitigated adverse environmental

impacts without there being any (or there being insufficient) benefits to outweigh such impacts.
2 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays
3
1. For the Court's peremptory writ of mandate requiring the Respondent to set aside
4 its decision certifying the EIR for the Project (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168, 21168.5,
5 21168.9, Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085, 1094.5);
6
2. For the Court's peremptory writ of mandate requiring the Respondent to fully 7 comply with the requirements of CEQA, the State Planning and Zoning Law, and 8
the applicable Municipal Code prior to any future approval of the Project (Pub.
9 Res. Code §§ 21168, 21168.5, 21168.9, Gov. Code § 65300 et seq., Code of Civil 10 Procedure §§ 1085, 1094.5);
11
3. For a judgment enforcing the duty imposed upon the Respondent by CEQA to 12 adequately address potential individual and cumulative impacts to the
13 environment in any subsequent action taken regarding the Project; 14
4. For a judgment enforcing the duty imposed upon the Respondent by CEQA to 15 adequately consider mitigation to reduce significant impacts in any subsequent 16 action taken to approve the Project;
17 5. For a judgment enforcing the duty imposed upon the Respondent by CEQA to 18 adopt a feasible environmentally superior alternative to reduce significant impacts 19 in any subsequent action taken to approve the Project; 20
6. For a judgment requiring the County to prepare, circulate and consider a new and 21 legally adequate Environmental Impact Report and otherwise comply with CEQA 22 in any subsequent action taken to approve this Project;
23
7. For costs of suit, including attorney's fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
24
cO. 1021.5 and other provisions of law; and
25
8. For such other and further relief, including a stay or preliminary or permanent 26 injunctive relief, in the event that the Real Party in Interest, or its agents or
27 instrumentalities, intend to commence construction on the site.
