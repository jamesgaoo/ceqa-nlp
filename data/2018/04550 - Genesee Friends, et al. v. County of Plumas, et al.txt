INTRODUCTION
1.

2 1. Petitioners Genesee Friends, Elisa Adler, Donald Aitken, Alejandro Jayo, Selena Jayo,

3 Betsy Kraemer, Frank Hanson, Bill Young, and Nancy Kull, collectively "Petitioners,"

4 respectfully petition this Court for a writ of mandate ordering Plumas County to rescind its
5
August 1, 2017 decision to approve a finding of functional equivalency for a heliport owned and
6

7 constructed by Real Party in Interest Genesee Valley Ranch, LLC in Genesee Valley and for any

8 heliport on other land zoned Agricultural Preserve in Plumas County ("Project"). As set forth

9 more fully below, the County's approval of the Project is inconsistent with the California

10 Planning and Zoning Law, the Plumas County General Plan and zoning code, the Genesee
11

12 Valley Special Management Area Plan and the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"),

13 Pub. Res. Code §§ 21000 et seq. Petitioners seek a writ of mandate directing the County to set

14 aside its approval of the Project pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085 & 1094.5.

15
PARTIES
16
2.
17 Petitioner Genesee Friends is an unincorporated nonprofit association. Genesee Friends'

18 members include individuals and residents of Plumas County who will be adversely affected by

19 the County's decision to allow a heliport and helicopter operations on Real Party's land, and who

20 will be adversely affected by allowing heliports as a ministerial, appurtenant use to agricultural

21 operations on Ag Preserve lands in the County. Genesee Friends and its members actively

22 participated in administrative proceedings leading to the County's approval of the heliport

23 project. Petitioners Elisa Adler, Donald Aitken, Alejandro Jayo, Selena Jayo, Betsy Kraemer,

24 Frank Hanson, Bill Young, And Nancy Kull, are, and at all times mentioned herein were,

25 individuals, members of Genesee Friends, and residents living in Genesee Valley and Plumas
County.
26
3.
27 Petitioners are vitally and beneficially interested in the decision made by the Respondents

28 that will affect Genesee Valley and all other land in Plumas County zoned as Agricultural

Second Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Page

1 Preserve. Petitioners' interest, as well as the interests of other residents, landowners, and

2 citizens within Plumas County, will be directly and indirectly impacted by this approval and the

3 direct and indirect environmental impacts caused by the issuance of the Project's approval.

4 4. Respondent Plumas County is, and at all times mentioned herein was, a political

5 subdivision of the State of California responsible for approving the Project in this case.

6 5. Real Party in Interest Genesee Valley Ranch, LLC is a California limited liability

7 corporation with its chief place of business in Plumas County, owns the land on which the

8 Project is proposed to be located and is the applicant for the Project in this case.

9 6. Petitioners do not know the true names or capacities, whether individual, corporate, or

10 otherwise, of those Real Parties in Interest sued herein as Does 1-20. Petitioners are informed

11 and believe and thereon allege that said Real Parties in Interest are in some manner responsible

12 for the adoption of, imposition of, or administration of those actions of which Petitioners

13 complain herein. Petitioners will amend this Petition to set forth the true names and capacities of

14 the fictitiously named Real Parties in Interest when such information has been ascertained.
15 Petitioners are informed and believe and, based upon such information and belief allege, that

16 each Real Party in Interest is responsible in some manner for the occurrences herein alleged.

1.7 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

18 7. On December 11, 2015, the Napa County Planning Department noticed the preparation of

19 a draft Environmental Impact Report ("DEPR") prepared under CEQA for the construction of 'a
20 private helipad and hangar for personal use" on Real Party's 224 acre estate and vineyard in Napal

21 County. The Notice states that the helipad will be for personal use and not for any commercial

22 purpose. The DEIR purports to assess potentially significant effects of the project requiring

23 CEQA review based on impacts relating to agricultural resources, biological resources, noise, air

24 quality/greenhouse gas emissions, hazards and hazardous materials and land use.

25 8. Around this time, Real Party and its consultant met with the Plumas County Planning
26 Department and went over the requirements for constructing and using a helipad and helicopter

27 on this parcel in Genesee Valley, in Plumas County. At this meeting, Real Party argued that

28

Second Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Page 3

1 another family in Plumas County had a heliport and that Real Party too should be entitled to a

2 helipad without the need for a permit.

3 9. On January 8, 2016, Real Party filed a request with the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) for use of part of their property as heliport. The application states that the proposed

S helicopter landing site will be utilized for non-commercial purposes as a private Heliport during

6 the day and night.

7 10. On January 14, 2016, Real Party submitted an application for a "No Fee Shed" (Permit

8 #16-121 A).

9 11. Beginning in February 2016, residents in Genesee Valley began to question the County

10 about information they were receiving that Real Party was proposing to construct a helipad for

11 regular helicopter use on his parcel. On February 3, 2016, Genesee Friends member Diane

12 McCombs ("McCombs") asked County planner Becky Herrin ("Herrin") for copies of "notices

13 on the Special-Use Permit process for the proposed helicopter pad and barn by the Palmaz

14 family."

15 12. On February 4, 2016, Herrin replied that the County 'had not yet received an application.

16 You will be placed on the notice list." Shortly afterwards, Herrin informed Petitioner's members

17 "A helipad is considered a "transport station" under the Plumas County Code. Transport stations

18 are permitted in agricultural Preserve zoning, subject to the issuance of a Special Use Permit. No

19 project can be approved if it is not in conformance with the General Plan and Zoning (including

20 Genesee Valley Special Management area). The County has not yet received any application for

21 a Special Use Permit." (emphasis added.) Following this communication Herrin informed

22 Petitioner's members that she could not "answer questions about how the County would issue the

23 permit, or how the county would view the permit, because there is no permit application to

24 review. The county will evaluate the project, prepare a CEQA document, prepare a staff report

25 and any questions from the public will be addressed during the public review period and the

26 public hearing. Anything else is just speculation. Once we receive the application, and it is

27 complete, we will process the application according to code requirements and state law. A

28 special use permit may take six months to review and take to hearing." Later Herrin provided

Second Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Page

1 more information, explaining that the "evaluation...will be based on site specific information
provided by the applicant," that this will all be explained in documents prepared during the

3 processing of the application," and that "[m]ost requirements" for the evaluation will "come from

4 [CEQA]."

5 13. During the week of February 7, 2016, Petitioner's member Elisa Adler ("Adler") was

6 informed by County Building Director John Cunningham that Real Party would be required to

7 obtain a special use permit for a helipad and that no building permit would be issued prior to that

8 date.

9 14. On February 15, 2016, in response to questions about whether Real Party's proposal to

10 build a large shed on its property was in reality simply a proposal to build a helipad and

11 helicopter hanger, Herrin stated: "From the County's standpoint... we can't go by intent.

12 Whatever the intention of the use is in regards to the building does not matter. The applicant has

13 signed the permit saying that the building is to be used for agricultural storage. We have no

14 knowledge that that is false. We can only enforce what is actually happening. If the helicopter
15 actually physically goes inside the building, then we may be able to do something about that use.

16 Until then, we operate on the actuality of the permit and the permit conditions."

17 15. On March 10, 2016, the FAA sent Real Party a notice describing the helipad project

18 proposed for Plumas County as construction and establishment of a heliport, for private use day

19 and night.
20 16. On March 23, 2016, the County voided Real Party's prior application for a shed, stating

21 that "Owner not building shed. Barn / Storage [Building] will be built [sic] in its place CV)" The

22 County's notice states that the storage building will fall within "Use and Occupancy

23 Classification 311.2 Group S-1 "Buildings occupied for storage uses that are not classified as

24 Group S-2, including , but not limited to, storage of the following:.... Aircraft hangar (storage

25 and repair)." (emphasis added.) No members of the public were ever notified of this permit

26 application or approval.

27 17. On March 28, 2016, County Board Member Lori Simpson, informed Genesee Friends

28 members that a special use permit would be required for a heliport operation and that the Generall

Second Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Page

1 more information, explaining that the "evaluation... will be based on site specific information

2 provided by the applicant," that this will all be explained in documents prepared during the

3 processing of the application," and that "[m]ost requirements" for the evaluation will "come from
[CEQA]."

5 13. During the week of February 7, 2016, Petitioner's member Elisa Adler ("Adler") was

6 informed by County Building Director John Cunningham that Real Party would be required to

7 obtain a special use permit for a helipad and that no building permit would be issued prior to that

8 date.

9 14. On February 15, 2016, in response to questions about whether Real Party's proposal to

10 build a large shed on its property was in reality simply a proposal to build a helipad and

11 helicopter hanger, Herrin stated: "From the County's standpoint... we can't go by intent.

12 Whatever the intention of the use is in regards to the building does not matter. The applicant has

13 signed the permit saying that the building is to be used for agricultural storage. We have no

14 knowledge that that is false. We can only enforce what is actually happening. If the helicopter

15 actually physically goes inside the building, then we may be able to do something about that use.

16 Until then, we operate on the actuality of the permit and the permit conditions."

17 15. On March 10, 2016, the FAA sent Real Party a notice describing the helipad project

18 proposed for Plumas County as construction and establishment of a heliport, for private use day

19 and night.

20 16. On March 23, 2016, the County voided Real Party's prior application for a shed, stating

21 that "Owner not building shed. Barn / Storage [Building] will be built [sic] in its place CV)" The

22 County's notice states that the storage building will fall within "Use and Occupancy

23 Classification 311.2 Group S-1 "Buildings occupied for storage uses that are not classified as

24 Group S-2, including , but not limited to, storage of the following:.... Aircraft hangar (storage

25 and repair)." (emphasis added.) No members of the public were ever notified of this permit

26 application or approval.

27 17. On March 28, 2016, County Board Member Lori Simpson, informed Genesee Friends

28 members that a special use permit would be required for a heliport operation and that the General

Second Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Page

1 Plan required the County to ensure that the development of future private airstrips and helipads

2 address land use compatibility issues. Simpson informed further that, as part of the approval

3 process of these private facilities, the County shall consult and coordinate with the Plumas

4 County ALUC (Airport Land Use Commission) to address any setback, height, or land use

S restrictions associated with operation of the private airfield/helipad.

6 18. During this time, through April 1, 2016, Genesee Friends' members observed large

7 dirt/gravel trucks at up to a 35 a day passing on the way to and from what appeared to be helipad

8 construction site on Real Party's Plumas County parcel. Between May 2 to May 16 2016,
9 Petitioner's members observed cement trucks passing to Real Party's helipad location.

10 19. On May 6, 2016, County staff Randy Hicks communicated to Ken Roper regarding Real

11 Party's storage building permit application the following instructions: "1) Occupancy use is S-1.

12 Please revise code analysis to reflect this use. 2) Per Sections 1008.1.5. and 10081.6, 2013 CBC

13 show floor level and landing size at required exits. 3) Note location of Main Service Entrance

14 Panel and average. 4) Note on the plans the Class 1, Division 2 locations and the minimum
15 heights of lighting above and distance from the sides of aircraft engines and fuel tanks per 2013

16 CEC, Articles 513." (emphasis added.)

17 20. On May 6, 2016, the FAA notified Real Party that its construction of a private helipad

18 and helicopter use would not adversely affect the safety and efficient use of airspace given

19 existing air traffic conditions in the area, The Notice states that it is not making any
20 determination regarding other impacts of the project beyond those of the health and safety of

21 helicopter users and those on the ground.
22 21. On May 17, 2016, County staff Hicks reviewed and signed a 'Special Inspection Report

23 from Howard Breen for "high strength bolting." That same day the County issued Real Party a

24 Permit Issued for Barn and Storage Building." The public was never notified of this permit

25 approval.

26 22. On July 14, 2016, in response to observations by Petitioner's members that Real Party

27 was constructing a large building on its property, Herrin confirmed that 1) the County had not

28

Second Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Page 6

1 yet received an application for a special use permit for helipad and helicopter operation; and 2)

2 the building under construction was a 'no-fee ag storage building.'
23. On July 21, 2016, the Planning Commission minutes state: "Several residents of Genesee
express concern about General Plan changes."

5 24. On July 22, 2016, Petitioner's member Adler emailed Herrin asking: "What is going on

6 with the Palmaz and Planning regarding a heliport in the no-airport area of Genesee Valley."

*? The email goes on to state "I'm wondering if there's something in process with the Palmaz and

8 Planning Department that I, So far, simply lack the language to ask about?"

9 25. In response, on July 26, 2016, Herrin stated that: "We have not received a Special Use

10 Permit application," and they they had "not received any other applications."

11 26. On August 8, 2016, Real Party's attorneys submitted a formal request that the County

12 make a determination under zoning Code Section that Real Party's use of a heliport and

13 helicopter on its parcel could be considered as 'functionally equivalent' to existing allowed

14 agricultural uses, such as driving a truck on the parcel to check on cattle. The letter argued

15 further that the helipad could not be considered a 'transport station' because the helipad was no

16 different than a driveway or garage, which would not require a special use permit. The existence

17 of the August 8, 2017 letter or Real Party's legal request was not disclosed to the public until

18 seven months later, in March 2017.

19 27 On or about August 12, 2016, Real Party began to use the 'no-fee ag storage building" it
20 had constructed on its property as a heliport for helicopter use, as documented by photos taken

21 by Petitioner's members.

22 28. On August 16, 2016, Real Party formerly applied to the County for a determination that a
23 heliport and helicopter use of its property was a functionally equivalent use to Ag Preserve

24 ministerial uses pursuant to Plumas County Code § 9.2.401(b)(3). The County did not provide

25 any notice to Petitioner's members regarding this application. The existence of the Real Party's

26 request that the County make this determination was not disclosed to the public until seven

27 months later, in March 2017.

28

Second Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Page

1 29. On August 29, 2016, Petitioner's members filed a complaint to the County on behalf of

2 Genesee Friends regarding the Real Party's use of its property as a heliport. The Complaint
listed alleged violations as 1) building a structure without a permit; 2) non-compliance with

4 commercial site plan; and 3) zoning and planning violations. The Complaint states: "A building

5 permit was issued by the Plumas County Building Department for a storage facility/agricultural

6 building in Genesee Valley. [Real Party] has constructed and is utilizing the permit location as a

*7 heliport... While property owners applied to the Building Department for a storage

8 facility/agriculture building, their request to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on

9 January 8, 2016 was for a heliport." The Complaint included five photos showing the building

10 with the helicopter parked on the cement slab outside the storage building. On behalf of Genesee

11 Friends, the complaint was signed by Elisa Adler, David Lind, Diane McCombs, Donald Aitken

12 and Alejandro Jayo, local citizens living in Genesee Valley and members of Genesee Friends.

13 30. Two days later, on August 31, 2016, four members of Genesee Friends met with County

14 staff Randy Wilson and Jim Green. At the meeting, Petitioner's members informed staff that

15 under California law, heliports are considered airports, which are not allowed in Genesee Valley.

16 At the meeting, Petitioner's members alerted the County that Real Party had already applied to

17 the FAA for a permit to operate helicopter operations to and from its parcel in Plumas County.

18 At the meeting, Planning Director Randy Wilson stated that the "situation with the Palmaz
19 heliport is under review by attorneys, including county [counsel.]" Mr. Wilson also stated that
20 the Ag. Storage building for which the Palmaz had applied to the County is an Agricultural

21 Storage building even if it's used for storing helicopter. In communicating this message, Mr.

22 Wilson did not disclose that Real Party has officially requested two weeks earlier that the County

23 determine their new helipad and helicopter to be a ministerial use not requiring a special use

24 permit under County zoning.

25 31. On September 2, 2016, McCombs emailed County Counsel Settlemire and Planning staff

26 informing him about the meeting and requesting to be notified by County Counsel of any review

27 it had completed on the issue.

28

Second Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Page 8

1 32. On September 2, 2016, County Counsel Settlemire responded by stating that "the

2 analysis and advice we a provide a County official is a confidential attorney-client communication

3 that is not subject to disclosure to the public or other parties." In communicating this message,

4 Counsel Settlemire did not disclose that Real Party has officially requested two weeks earlier that

5 the County determine their new helipad and helicopter to be a ministerial use not requiring a

6 special use permit under County zoning.

7 33. On October 3, 2016, McCombs emailed Planning Director Wilson to inform him that

8 helicopter operations were occurring at Real Party's residence and that it had been over a month

9 since Petitioner submitted its formal complaint without any response from the County.

10 34. On November 4, 2016, Petitioner's member Adler left a message with Planning Director

11 Wilson regarding the helipad issue but received no response.

12 35. On November 11, 2016 McCombs visited Rebecca Herrin at the Planning Department to
13 inquire about the status of Petitioner's complaint, which had been filed 56 days previously

14 without any response. Herrin informed McCombs that the Department was 'waiting for county

15 counsel to deal with it." McCombs then sent an email to Herrin stating that Real Party was

16 continuing to operate his helicopter and illegal helipad, and that there had been no response to

17 either Petitioner's complaint or emails to or phone messages left with Planning Director Wilson.

18 36. On November 17, 2016, Herrin responded by stating: "I have already been told the

19 helicopter is using the site; actually many times." She also states that: "Ordinarily a code
20 enforcement complaint deal with a simple code violation. This complaint does not. This

21 complaint requires that the County provide an interpretation of the general plan, as well as an

22 investigation into FAA regulations CalTrans aeronautics regulations." In communicating this

23 message, Herrin did not disclose that Real Party has officially requested two months earlier on

24 August 16, 2016 that the County determine their new helipad and helicopter to be a ministerial

25 use not requiring a special use permit under County zoning.

26 37. On January 29, 2017, Petitioner Genesee Friends send an email to the County Board of

27 Supervisors, copied to Planning Director Wilson and County Counsel Settlemire stating that

28 under federal and state law, a heliport is considered an 'airport,' a land use that is specifically

Second Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Page 9

1 prohibited in the Genesee Valley Special Management Area under the Plumas County General

2 Plan. The email also inquired about the status of Petitioner Genesee Friends' complaint, filed 5

3 months prior on August 31, 2016.

4 38. On January 31, 2017, Plumas County Supervisor Kevin Goss, the Board member for the

5 Genesee Valley area, replied to a follow-up email from Petitioner's members that he would be

6 talking with County Counsel and would respond that evening. No response was provided.

7 39 On February 2, 2017, Supervisor Goss responded to another email from Petitioner's

8 member Adler asking for information stating that he would "reach out to you tomorrow." No
follow-up response was presented.

10 40. On February 3, 2017, Petitioner's member Adler emailed County staff Herrin inquiring

11 about the current status of Petitioner's complaint filed in August 2016 and "where we are in the

12 process, regardless of the decision."

13 41. On February 3, 2017, Herrin replied stating: "I have no update to give you." On

14 February 3, 2017, Petitioner's member Adler followed up with an email asking "Is the Planning

15 Department still waiting for a Special Use Permit to be submitted" by Real Party? Herrin did

16 not reply to this email. At no time during this interaction did Herrin disclose to Petitioner's

17 members that Real Party has officially requested over five months earlier on August 16, 2016

18 that the County determine their new helipad and helicopter to be a ministerial use not requiring :

19 special use permit under County zoning.
20 42. On February 24, 2017, Elizabeth Kraemer sent an email to Planning Director Wilson

21 inquiring about the status of the complaint filed by Petitioner Genesee Friends in August 2016.

22 No response to this email was made.

23 43. On March 6, 2017, Frank Hanson sent an email to Planning Director Wilson inquiring

24 about the status of the complaint filed by Petitioner Genesee Friends in August 2016. The email

25 also states "I recognize the concerns of Genesee Friends as they are the same as my own." No

26 response to this email was made.

27

28

Second Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Page 10

1 44. On March 13, 2017, Bill Young and Nancy Kull sent an email to Planning Director

2 Wilson inquiring about the status of the complaint filed by Petitioner Genesee Friends in August

3 2016. No response to this email was made.

4 45. On March 16, 2017, McCombs went to the Planning Department building and was

5 informed by the clerk at the counter that Real Party had applied for a permit to build a 4,800

6 square feet barn and storage building, which had been approved by the County on May 17, 2016.

7 Prior to this the public had not been informed of this permit application and approval of the

8 building, which was being used as a storage hangar by Real Party for its helicopter.

9 46. On March 16, 2017, County staff Herrin emailed Petitioner's members disclosing for the

10 first time that Real Party had requested a determination of a 'functionally equivalent use to a

11 defined use' seven months previously on August 16, 2017. Herrin's email states that "Since the

12 request was filed, I have [been] operating under the direction of County Counsel to process this

13 request." Herrin's email does not explain why she did not disclose the existence of this request to

14 Petitioner's members during their multiple inquiries during this 7 month period, or whether she

15 had been instructed by County Counsel Settlemire not to disclose this information.
16 47. On March 17, 2017, Herrin responded to an email inquiry from Petitioner member Adler

17 about what was meant by a 'functional equivalent use' under County Code by stating: "This will

18 all be explained in the staff report and at the public hearing before the Zoning Administrator."

19 48. On March 23, 2017, McCombs wrote a letter on behalf of Genesee Friends directly to the
20 Board of Supervisors clerk, stating that Real Party was now using the Ag Storage building as a

21 hanger pad for its helicopter, that Real Party had constructed an unlawful concrete helipad, and

22 was now operating a helicopter to and from his parcel. The letter notes that Real Party did not

23 disclose in its March 2016 application that it intended to use the building as a helicopter hanger.

24 49. On March 27, 2017, McCombs requested a copy of the staff report from County staff

25 Herrin. Herring responded that same day by email, which states: "The notice date is 10 days

26 before the hearing, and that is when the staff report is sent to the applicant and given to the

27 director for review. Then it can be released to the public."

28

Second Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Page 11

1 50. On March 29, 2017, Herrin sent out an email to Petitioner' member McCombs that the

2. hearing for the functional equivalent determination would be April 19, 2017 at 10:00 a.m..

3 51. On April 7, 2017, the County issued a staff report, which provided background on Real

4 Party's request to allow a helipad and helicopter use on his parcel without the need for any permit

S process. The staff report states that the County General Plan does not regulate heliports and

6 helicopters, which on Ag lands may be considered comparable to a driveway and garage and

7 truck for traveling on the property, and thus appropriately an appurtenant use to Real Party's

8 agricultural operation. The staff report goes on to state that such helicopter use, as an

9 'appurtenant' agricultural use, could not legally be considered a nuisance since it was now

10 entitled to the agricultural exemption for nuisances in the County's Right to Farm Ordinance.

11 52. On April 15, 2017, the County published a notice in the Indian Valley Record of a

12 hearing to determine Real Party's request that a heliport/ helicopter use was a functionally

13 equivalent use to Ag Preserve ministerial uses pursuant to Plumas County Code § 9.2.401(b)(3).

14 The Notice stated:

15 The Planning Director will hold a hearing on the following matter on Wednesday, April
16 19, 2017 in the Conference room of the Plumas County Permit Center, 555 Main Street, Quincy, CA at 10 a.m. Determination of the Planning Director-Functionally Equivalent
17 Use to a Defined Use pursuant to Plumas County Code Sections 9-2.211, 9-2.303 and 9-

18 2.401(b). Application for determination that personal and agricultural use of helicopter is a ministerial, appurtenant use to the working ranch and existing residence.
19

20 53. Approximately 35 persons showed up for the April 19, 2017 hearing, which was

21 promptly continued by the Planning Director to May 3, 2017.

22 54. On May 3, 2017 the matter was heard in front of County Planning Director Wilson, who

23 announced the County would continue to consider and accept public comment on the application.

24 55. Petitioners filed written public comments that the heliport violated the Plumas County

25 General Plan, County zoning codes, and the Genesee Valley Special Management Area Plan,

26 which specifically disallows "airports" in Genesee Valley. Petitioners and other residents of

27 Plumas County filed written comments specifying noise, wildlife, aesthetic, water quality, and

28 other environmental impacts that needed to be addressed under CEQA.

Second Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Page 12

1 56. Subsequently the County gave 'notice' of its pending decision by emailing persons on a

2 '1ist' of interested parties. The notice states that the Planning Director would release a decision

3 on Friday, June 30, 2017 at 10 a.m. in the Conference room of the Plumas County Permit Center,

4 555 Main Street, Quincy, CA. The Notice describes the project as application for determination

5 that personal and agricultural use of helicopter is a ministerial, appurtenant use to the working

6 ranch and existing residence located at 1172 Beckwourth-Taylorsville Road, Genesee, in

7 unincorporated Plumas County. The Notice also states that, per Plumas County Code section 9-

8 2.1001, any decision of the Planning Director may be appealed in writing to the Clerk of the

9 Board of Supervisors within ten (10) calendar days after the decision by the Planning Director.

10 57. On June 28, 2017, McCombs contacted the County Board of Supervisors clerk Nancy

11 DaForno asking about an appeal that might have to be submitted in response to Planning

12 Director Wilson's anticipated decision. McCombs was informed by Daforno that appeal checks

13 should be made out to Plumas County and delivered to her with the completed appeal

14 documents.

15 58. On June 30, 2017, the Planning Director issued his decision approving the Project. The

16 decision states: "[T]he Planning Director's determination is that the Genesee Ranch heliport and

17 a heliport on other lands zoned Agricultural Preserve is a functionally a equivalent use

18 (appurtenant use or "appurtenance") to those uses permitted in the Agricultural Preserve (AP)

19 zoning as defined in Plumas County Code Sections 9-2.211 and 9-2.3002." The decision states

20 that its decision, that a heliport and helicopter operations on Ag Preserve lands in the County is a

21 ministerial use, is not subject to CEQA, citing Public Resources Code § 21080.

22 59. On July 5, 2017, Board Clerk DaForno called to inform McCombs that the appeal process

23 had changed in recent years and that the fee and materials should be submitted to the Planning

24 Department instead of the Board. McCombs contacted Petitioner's counsel Mike Jackson to

25 inform him of this information.

26 60. On July 10, 2017, Petitioners filed their appeal of the Director's decision to the County

27 Planning Department as instructed by the Board clerk. The appeal was submitted by Petitioner's

28 counsel Michael Jackson as a two-page letter on Mr. Jackson's letterhead. The letter identifies

Second Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Page 13

1 the challenged decision, that appellant Genesee Friends is composed of citizens living in

2 Genesee Valley who may be adversely affected by the decision, and the legal grounds of the

3 appeal. Id. On July 10, 2017, the date that the notice of appeal was to be filed, Mr. Jackson went

4 to the Planning Department and filed the appeal letter. The appeal was accepted by senior
planner Rebecca Herrin, along with the fee for filing the appeal ($770.00). The appeal letter was

6 stamped 'received' by Ms. Herrin. At no time did planning staff Herrin dispute the
appropriateness of filing the appeal at the Planning Department or the adequacy of the filing or

8 mention the need to use the Board of Supervisors form.

9 61. On July 12, 2017, Real Parties' attorney submitted a letter to the Planning Director

10 arguing that the appeal was invalid because Petitioner had not used the proper 'form' for the

11 appeal. The letter was not circulated to the public or to Petitioners or their counsel.

12 62. Several weeks later, the County posted an agenda for its August 1, 2017 Board of

13 Supervisors hearing, which stated as an agenda item, "B. Receive appeal of Genesee Friends and

14 set public hearing date to consider appeal; discussion and possible action."

15 63. Four days before the hearing, on July 27, 2017, County Counsel Settlemire left a message

16 with Petitioner's counsel Jackson that that the Board of Supervisors would discuss the date for

17 the appeal hearing at the regularly scheduled Board meeting on August 1, 2017 and that Real

18 Party's attorney Brian Russell had filed some papers that disputed the adequacy of the appeal

19 filing, which would also be discussed at the meeting. These papers were never provided to Mr.
20 Jackson or to Petitioners prior to the meeting.

21 64. On August 1, 2017, Petitioner's attorney Mr. Jackson attended the hearing and argued

22 that the appeal should be heard. At the hearing, Supervisor Thrall inquired of the Clerk of the

23 Board whether the appeal forms were 'available' at the time the appeal was filed. The Board

24 clerk replied' After the fact, the form was found, and I may have decided ... that I did find the

25 It form. It has now been posted on the website." Mr. Jackson then asked whether it was "fair to

26 say, that at the time of this appeal was filed, it was not to be found and you didn't have this?" to

27 which the Board clerk replied: "That's correct." Later in the hearing Mr. Jackson testified that he

28 filed the appeal not with the Board but with the Planning Department as citizens had been

Second Amended Verifled Petition for Writ of Mandate Page 14

1 instructed to do by the Board clerk. At the time Mr. Jackson asked planning staff "whether or

2 not there was anything they needed, and they said, 'Oh, yes. Let me put the file stamp on it to

3 make sure to everyone that it was filed on time.," Further discussion at the hearing revealed that

4 the last time an appeal had been filed in Plumas County was 2009, which may have accounted

5 for the form not being available at the time of the filing of the appeal.
65. Following the discussion, the Board voted to deny the appeal, which ended any further
possibility for Petitioners to exhaust remedies in this case.

8 66. On August 1, 2017, the Board of Supervisors dismissed the appeal based on a finding that a

9 the appeal had been filed on the wrong form.

10 67. On August 8, 2017, the County filed a Notice of Exemption (NOE) stating that the

11 Project was exempt from CEQA as the Planning Director's decision that the heliport and

12 helicopter operation were the "functional equivalent" of a farm implement under Plumas County

13 Code Sections 9-2.211 and 9-2.3002 was a ministerial action not subject to CEQA under Public

14 Resources Code § 21080.

15 68. Petitioners have exhausted administrative remedies in this matter. Over the past two years,

16 Petitioner Genesee Friends and its members have written numerous comments emails and even

17 formal complaint on the project sent to the County in August 2016 on behalf of Genesee Friends.

18 During this same time period, the County has provided false information as to how the

19 heliport/helicopter approval would require a special use permit, has wrongly treated Real Party's
20 permit application as only for a storage barn despite knowledge that the purpose of the building

21 was to house a helicopter, and, despite numerous and constant inquiries from the public

22 regarding the regulatory status of Real Party's unlawful helipad and helicopter use, waited over

23 seven months before finally disclosing to the public that the County intended to hear a request by

24 the Real Party to treat the heliport/helicopter as a ministerial agricultural use that did not require

25 a permit. Following this announcement the public was provided only 10 days' notice of the only

26 public hearing, which occurred on April 19, 2017. During the hearing process for the Planning

27 Director's determination, citizens attended two hearings, and gave oral and written testimony that

28 there would be significant environmental effects from the project, that the Planning Director's

Second Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Page 15

1 determination was not a ministerial decision under CEQA, and that the Project was being

2 approved in a manner contrary to the County General Plan and zoning code, as well as the

3 Genesee Valley Special Management Area Plan. Following the Planning Director's June 30,

4 2017 decision, Petitioner Genesee Friends filed a timely appeal which identified the matter

5 appealed, the legal basis for the appeal and the identity of the appellant, Genesee Friends,

6 representing its affected members living in Genesee Valley. Following the filing of the appeal,

7 the County set the matter for agenda at regularly scheduled meeting on August 1, 2017, at

8 which point the notice informed persons that Petitioner's appeal would be set for hearing.

9 Nothing in the notice alerted Petitioners or the public that their appeal might be dismissed at the

10 Board meeting.

11 69. On August 1, 2017, Petitioner's attorney Mr. Jackson attended the hearing and argued

12 that the appeal should be heard. Notwithstanding these arguments, the Board voted to deny the

13 appeal, which ended any further possibility for Petitioners to exhaust remedies in this case.

14 70. Petitioners' actions in this case constitute adequate exhaustion in that Petitioners

15 participated in all administrative forums available to them, and that once no more forum was

16 made available, there could be no more duty to exhaust.

17 71. Petitioners' actions in this case constitute substantial compliance with the exhaustion

18 requirement, in that the appeal was timely filed and adequately informed the County of all the

19 substantive information regarding the matter, the legal grounds and the appellant's identity.
20 Further, Appellant Genesee Friends is well known to County officials based on its complaint and

21 numerous emails and other communications, see Paragraphs 11, 29, 30, 37, 42-44, 48 supra, and
22 was adequately identified in the appeal filed on July 10, 2017.

23 72. In the alternative, Petitioners allege that exhaustion of remedies was not required in this

24 case due to the County's failure to comply with notice requirements under State law and County

25 Code. See e.g., Govt. Code §§ 54954.2; Govt. Code § 65009; 65090; 65094 65853-65857. In

26 this instance, the County's notice did not disclose that the County intended to make a

27 determination regarding the use of helipads/heliports on all Ag Preserve parcels in the County,

28 Thus the County may not raise exhaustion as a defense. See Scott v. Indian Wells (1972) 6 Cal.

Second Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Page 16

1 3d 541; Horn v. County of Ventura (1979) 24 Cal. 3d 605; McQueen v. Board of Dirs. (1988)

2 202 Cal. App. 3d 1136; Drum v. Fresno County Dept. of Public Works (1983) 144 Cal. App. 3d

3 777; Kennedy v. South Coast Regional Com. (1977) 68 Cal. App. 3d 660.

4 73. In the alternative, Petitioners allege that exhaustion of remedies was not required in this

5 case due to the fact that the Planning Director's June 30, 2017 determination constituted a de

6 facto zoning amendment, a final decision for which cannot be made by the Planning Department.

7 The County's failure to comply with the proper statutory procedure for processing zoning
8  amendments precludes the County from raising an exhaustion defense involving an appeal that

9 the County was not statutorily allowed to require in the first place. See Govt. Code §8 65853-

10 65856; City of Sausalito v. County of Marin (1970) 12 Cal. App. 3d 550, 563-564.

11 74. Each Petitioner has a beneficial interest in the County's full compliance with CEQA and

12 all other applicable laws when considering the project. Petitioners, other residents, property

13 owners and the public will be directly and substantially affected by the adverse environmental

14 impacts likely to result from the project. Petitioners have no alternative remedy in this case. The

15 County's denial of Petitioners' appeal on August 1, 2017 effectively approved the Project, with

16 no administrative recourse. Petitioners' claims are ripe for review.

17 75. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code § 21167 by

18 sending a notice of commencement of action notice to the County on September 11, 2017.

19 76. Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code § 21167.7 and Code of Civil

20 Procedure § 388, by providing a copy of its Petition for Writ of Mandate, the First Amended

21 Petition for Writ of Mandate, and this Second Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate to the

22 Attorney General's office.

23 77. By the authority of Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085 and 1094.5, and Public Resources

24 Code §§ 21168, 21168.5, and/or 21168.9, this Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandate to

25 set aside and rescind the County's decision to deny Petitioner's appeal and allow a heliport as a

26 ministerial permitted use on parcels in Plumas County zoned Agricultural Preserve.

27 78. Venue is proper because the causes of action alleged in this Petition arise in Plumas

28 County, where the Project is located and the environmental effects of the Project will occur.

Second Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Page 17

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 1 (Failure to Comply with CEQA)

2 79. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate herein by reference the allegations contained in the
3
Paragraphs above.
4

5 80. Respondents committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion law in filing the NOE and

6 failing to prepare an initial study and/or an environmental impact report to identify, analyze,

7 disclose, and mitigate significant environmental impacts from the Project prior to approval.

8 81. The ministerial exception to CEQA review, Pub. Res. Code § 21080, 14 Cal. Code Regs.
9

10 402 15002(i)(2), is one involving the use of fixed or objective standards rather than subjective

11 decision making in which no judgment by the public agency or official on the wisdom or manner

12 of carrying out the project is exercised. The agency or official merely applies the governing

13 statute or ordinance to the facts. 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15369.
14 82. The County Planning Director/Zoning Administrator exercised discretionary judgment in 15

16 deciding to approve the Project despite its potential to cause significant environmental effects

17 that have not been disclosed, evaluated, or mitigated. The ministerial exception to CEQA

18 therefore cannot apply. Such discretionary decision-making triggered the County's obligation to

19 consider the project's environmental effects as required by CEQA prior to approving the Project.
20 83.
21 The County's approval of the Project commits the County to a definitive course of action

22 that may result in significant physical environmental changes, both direct and indirect.

23 84. CEQA defines a "project" as "the whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting

24 in either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect a
25 physical change in the environment," which is undertaken by a governmental agency. CEQA
26

27 prohibits "piecemealing" or segmenting a larger project into smaller components to understate

28 project impacts, and requires environmental review of a project to address the whole of the

Second Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Page 18

1 action to be undertaken. Environmental review under CEQA must analyze the cumulative

2 effects of future actions that are a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the existing project,

3 and will likely change the scope or nature of the project, or its environmental effects.

4 85. In approving the Project the County not only approved the use of a heliport on Real
5
Party's parcel, but effectively approved such uses on all parcels zoned Ag Preserve in the
6

7 County. The cumulative impacts of the Project in the County will be significant on Ag Preserve

8 lands, wildlife, landowners and other County residents. Respondents did not evaluate the

9 Project's potential to cause or contribute to these significant environmental impacts or issues
10 prior to Project approval, in violation of CEQA. 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15300.2(b.)
11
86.
12 The County prejudicially abused its discretion in adopting the NOE while failing to

13 evaluate and mitigate individual and cumulative environmental impacts from the Project.

14 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (Failure to Comply with Planning and Zoning Laws, General Plan & Zoning Code
87.
16 Petitioners re-allege and incorporate herein by reference the allegations contained in the

17 Paragraphs above.

18 88. The County's approval of the Project violates proper planning and zoning procedure in

19 that the County made a legislative change to its zoning code to allow helipads as a ministerial, a
20

21 permitted use on all Ag Preserve lands without complying with the legal requirements for zoning

22 amendments. See Govt. Code $ 65853-65857. The Planning Director/Zoning Administrator does

23 not have the authority to approve a zoning change and the County's requirement that Petitioners

24 and other members of the public were required to appeal such a ruling is contrary to law.
25 89. The County's approval of the Project violates proper planning and zoning procedure in
26

27 that the County failed to comply with notice requirements under State law and County Code. See

28 e.g., Govt. Code §§ 54954.2; Govt. Code 65009; 65090; 65094 65853-65857. In this instance,

Second Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Page 19

1 the County's notice did not disclose that the County intended to make a determination regarding

2 the use of helipads/heliports on all Ag Preserve parcels in the County. See Scott v. Indian Wells

3 (1972) 6 Cal. 3d 541; Horn v. County of Ventura (1979) 24 Cal. 3d 605; McQueen v. Board of

4 Dirs. (1988) 202 Cal. App. 3d 1136; Drum v. Fresno County Dept. of Public Works (1983) 144
Cal. App. 3d 777; Kennedy v. South Coast Regional Com. (1977) 68 Cal. App. 3d 660.
6

90. The County's approval of the Project violates the County General Plan. General Plan
Policy 6.6.3 requires that any approval of a private-use helipad address land use compatibility

issues, as well as consultation and coordination with the Plumas Airport Land Use Commission

10 (ALUC). The General Plan states that project specific review will provide additional data and
11

12 feasible mitigations to reduce significant impacts related to airport safety. To address land use

13 compatibility issues General Plan Policies 3.1.2 and 3.1.3 require the County to identify and

14 consider the noise a new use will impose upon "noise sensitive areas" using standards identified

15 in the General Plan. Implementation Measure 2 of the Noise Element requires the County to
16
adopt a "Noise Ordinance" to implement policy 3.1.2. Before approving private-use helipads in
17

18 the County, the County must adopt a "Noise Ordinance" that will guide their decision-making to

19 ensure private-use helipads do not cause land use conflicts. None of these requirements were

20 met in the County's approval of the Project.

21 91. The Agriculture/Forestry Implementation Measure 17 of the General Plan requires the
22

23 County to amend its zoning code if it wishes to establish ministerial permitting for agricultural

24 support uses not already listed in the code. The County has not implemented a zoning

25 amendment to address ministerial permitting in the Ag Preserve Zone. The zoning code is
26 inconsistent with the General Plan and the decision by the Planning Director/Zoning
27 Administrator is in excess of his jurisdiction.
28

Second Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Page 20

1 92. The County's approval of the Project violates the Genesee Valley Special Management

2 Area Plan ("Genesee Plan"). The Genesee Plan is intended to protect public safety as well as the

3 values and rural character of the Genesee Valley Community by keeping facilities unobtrusive

4 and minimizing noise. The Genesee Plan prohibits airports in the Genesee Valley Special
5

6 Management Area (GVSMA), in which Real Party's proposed helipad is located. The Genesee

7 Plan also requires the County to to determine the ambient noise levels for the land use areas in

8 the GVSMA to establish acceptable noise levels for specific land use areas. The County's

9 approval violates these standards because the proposed helipad is an airport under the Genesee
10 Plan, and because the County has not established or considered the required analysis for the
11

12 GVSMA as part of its approval of the Project.

13 93. The County abused its discretion in determining under the County zoning code that a
14 helipad and helicopter is the 'functional equivalent' of a driveway and truck used on Ag Preserve

15 lands because the impacts of helicopter use are distinct and much greater than that of a truck
16
operating on a farm or ranch.
17

18 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
(Wrongful Denial of Petitioner's Appeal)
19 94. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate herein by reference the allegations contained in the
20 Paragraphs above.
21

22 95. The County's denial of Petitioner's appeal in this proceeding without providing a hearing

23 was arbitrary and capricious and otherwise not in accordance with law and required procedure in

24 violation of Code of Civil Procedure § 1085, and an abuse of discretion under Code of Civil
25 Procedure § 1094.5.
26

27

28

Second Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Page 21

96. 1 In the event the Court determines that Petitioners' allegations that exhaustion of remedies

2 was either adequate or unnecessary, see Paragraphs 69-74, supra and that therefore the Court

3 has jurisdiction to hear the merits of Petitioners' Petition, this claim would be moot.

4 97. In the alternative, if the Court determines that it must first rule that the County's appeal
5
denial was wrongful in order to have jurisdiction of the merits, Petitioners provide the following
6

7 additional allegations. The County chose not to hear but instead denied Petitioner's

8 administrative appeal based on its finding that Appellant had not used the correct form. This

9 action wrongfully deprived Petitioners of their right to appeal the Planning Director's decision
10 and to have that appeal heard by the Board of Supervisors. See Govt. Code §§ 65903-65904.
11

12 The Board's action was also an abuse of discretion, arbitrary and capricious and otherwise not in

13 accordance with law and required procedure under either Code of Civil Procedure § 1094.5 or

14 a 1085 in a number of ways, including but not limited to 1) Petitioner's appeal substantially

15 complied with the substantive requirements for exhaustion under County appeal code and
16 common law; 2) contrary to County Code, the Clerk of the Board did not have the required form 17

18 'available' at the time Petitioner's appeal was filed; 3) contrary to County Code that required the

19 appeal to be filed with the Clerk of the Board, Petitioners and their counsel were instead

20 informed that the appeal 'procedure had been changed' and that such appeal should now be made
21 to the Planning Department; 4) the County was adequately apprised of the identity of the
22
appellant, Genesee Friends, who was
23 well known to the County and organization responsible for

24 the initial complaint on the project filed a year prior in August 2016, see Paragraphs 11, 29, 30,

25 37, 42-44, 48, supra; 5) the County's notice of the project was deficient and thus was the County

26 was required to provide the correct notice prior to denying the appeal; 6) the County's approval
27 of the Project violates proper planning and zoning procedure, see Govt. Code § 65853-65857,
28

Second Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Page 22

1 and thus did not have authority to require an appeal in the first place; and 7) the Board agenda

2 item posted for the County Board of Supervisors' August 1, 2017 meeting did not provide

3 adequate notice to Petitioners or their counsel that the validity of their appeal would be evaluated.

4 and decided upon at the regular board meeting, rather than the required hearing for an appeal.

5
98. The County's approval of the Project violates proper planning and zoning procedure in
6
that the County failed to comply with notice requirements under State law and County Code. See

8 e.g., Govt. Code §§ 54954.2; Govt. Code § 65009; 65090; 65094 65853-65857. In this instance,

9 the County's notice did not disclose that the County intended to make a determination regarding

10 the use of helipads/heliports on all Ag Preserve parcels in the County.
11
PRAYER FOR RELIEF
12

13 WHEREFORE Petitioners pray as follows:

14 1. a That this Court issue a peremptory Writ of Mandate directing the County to set aside its

15 denial of Petitioners' appeal and its decision to approve the Project, suspend all activities in

16 furtherance of the Project and to comply with CEQA, Planning and Zoning laws the Plumas
17 County General Plan and Code in any subsequent action taken with respect to the Project;
18

19 2. For injunctive relief restraining any and all Respondents and Real Parties in Interest from

20 taking any action to carry out the Project;

21 3. That Petitioners be awarded the costs incurred in bringing this action;

22 That Petitioners be awarded reasonable attorney fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure

23

24 § 1021.5, or as otherwise provided by law or equity;

25 5. That the Court grant such other and further relief as may be equitable and just.
