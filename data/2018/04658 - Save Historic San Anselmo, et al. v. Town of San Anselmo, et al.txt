Petition for Writ of Mandamus

1 Petitioners allege:

2 Introduction

3

4 1. Save Historic San Anselmo, an unincorporated association, and resident

5 Laurel Mellin bring this mandamus action in the public interest to enforce mandatory

6 environmental and land use laws in the public interest. Petitioners challenge the Town's
7

8 approval of the 260 Crescent Road Residential Project without complying with its

9 Municipal Code, General Plan, and the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).

10 The project proposes demolition of an intact 1909 residence and accessory

11 dwelling that a 1986 Town Inventory identified as eligible for historic listing.

26 As acknowledged by Town staff, "the existing residence is charming and contributes to
27

28 the neighborhood's historic character it has not been significantly modified."

Petition for Writ of Mandamus

1 The new owners, real parties in interest Charles and Ellen Jenkins, purchased the

2 property in 2016. To accommodate the Jenkins' proposal for a new home, the Town

3

4 Council issued its first-ever approval for demolition of an over-100-year-old structure

5 in its historic Seminary neighborhood, all without the benefit of an independent historic

6 resource report as recommended by staff. The Council based the approvals of

7 demolition, challenged here, on unsupported findings in violation of the Municipal

9 Code, and exempted the project from CEQA despite conceded environmental impacts

10 for which the Council recognized the need for, and imposed, mitigation measures.

11 CEQA exemptions are not allowed for projects requiring mitigation measures.
12 A peremptory writ should issue requiring that the Town set aside the project and
13

14 conduct CEQA review before considering approvals compliant with its Municipal Code.

15

16 Jurisdiction

17 2. This Court has jurisdiction under Public Resources Code section 21168 and

18

1.9 CCP section 1094.5. The parties and the project site are located in the County of Marin.

20 Parties
21

22 3. Petitioner Save Historic San Anselmo is an unincorporated association

23 formed in the public interest in August 2018 after the Town's approval of the 260

24 Crescent Road Residential project. The association's purpose is to protect the historic
25

26 neighborhood and ensure the Town's compliance with CEQA and its own regulations

27 that value the ongoing preservation of the Town's unique historic character. Petitioner

28 a Laurel Mellin is a member of Save Historic San Anselmo and is a resident of the

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 2

1 neighborhood. Members of Save Historic San Anselmo, including Laurel Mellin,

2 include community residents and concerned citizens who enjoy and appreciate the

3 environmental and historical resources of San Anselmo. They bring this petition on
4

5 behalf of all others similarly situated that are too numerous to be named and brought

6 before this Court as petitioners. Laurel Mellin objected to the Town's approval of the

7 260 Crescent Road Residential Project and exhausted administrative remedies on
8

9 behalf of herself and the later-formed group.

10 4. Respondents Town of San Anselmo and its Town Council (collectively, the

11 Town) are the governmental body and lead agency that approved the project and a

12 categorical exemption from CEQA.
13

14 5. Real Parties in Interest Charles and Ellen Jenkins are the applicants for the

15 260 Crescent Road Residential Project and are so named in the Notice of Exemption.

16 6. Does 1 to 10 are fictitiously-named real parties in interest whose true
17

18 names and capacities are currently unknown to Petitioners. If and when their true

19 names and capacities are known, petitioners will amend this petition to assert them.

20 7. The paragraphs below refer to and rely on information in documents

21 relating to this action, all of which will be filed with this Court as part of the record of

22

23 proceedings and are here incorporated by reference.

24

25 General Allegations

26 8. The 260 Crescent Road Residential Project proposes the demolition of a

27 1909 home and accessory dwelling in the historic Seminary neighborhood of the Town
28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 3

1 to a build a new home and accessory dwelling unit of substantially larger dimensions.

2 The proposed project requires numerous discretionary Town permits:
3

4 Conditional use permit and design review to demolish existing structures.
Design review for the new single-family residence and additional dwelling unit.

6 Conditional use permit for reduced setbacks for the additional dwelling unit.
A variance to maintain a parking space in the front yard setback.

8 A minor exception for bump out on the second story.

9
9.
10 The Town prepared an Historic Resource Inventory in 1986 "to serve as

11 the base document in a community-wide program that will be conducted to determine

12 the theme that will control future alterations and development in the downtown area;

13 to serve as a basic document for the historic preservation concepts to be included in the
14

15 City's zoning and planning deliberations; and to provide basic information for a series

16 of envisioned applications nominating selected properties for the State or National

17 Register." During the inventory, the Town completed an Historic Resources Data

18 Encoding Sheet for 260 Crescent for the California Department of Parks and
19

20 Recreation, and marked the residence eligible for local historic listing individually or as

21 part of an historic district. The inventory was not adopted by ordinance or resolution.

22 The existing residence is considered legal non-conforming.
23
10.
24 The Town Planning Commission considered and approved the project in

25 May 2018 over the objections of area residents based, inter alia, on the needless

26 demolition of the historic residence and visual impacts of the project's height and mass.
27 They requested the grade of the site be lowered to reduce the finished floor elevation.
28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus

1 11. Concerned Town residents filed an administrative appeal with the Town

2 Council, reiterating the concerns expressed at the Planning Commission and objecting
3 to reliance on a categorical exemption from CEQA. The Town Council denied the appeal
4

5 following a public hearing on June 26, 2018. The Town filed a Notice a of Exemption

6 (NOE) from CEQA with the Marin County Clerk on July 6, 2018. This action is timely

7 on August 10, within 35 days of the filing of the NOE.
8
12.
9 Petitioners have served a copy of this petition on the Attorney General.

10 13. Petitioners have no adequate remedy at law. Absent the relief prayed for in

11 this petition, the project will proceed with significant irreparable and irreversible

12 environmental impacts to the Town's environment and its residents. The Town Council
13

14 has the ability to correct its violations of law but has failed and refused to do so.

15

16 First Cause of Action

17 Violations of the California Environmental Quality Act

18 14. Petitioners incorporate all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.

19
15. The Town abused its discretion and failed to act in the manner required by
20

21 law in approving the 260 Crescent Road Residential Project based on a categorical

22 exemption from CEQA. According to proof following certification of the record of

23 I proceedings:
24 from CEQA is disallowed because the Town adopted
25 a. Categorical exemption

26 mitigation measures to address conceded environmental impacts, and unlawfully

27

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 5

1 deferred discretionary environmental analysis and full mitigation of project

2 impacts to future study.

3
b. The Town unlawfully approved a project with potentially significant 4

5 environmental impacts on the basis of a categorical exemption and thus without

6 any environmental review to inform its discretion. The record contains

7 substantial evidence supporting a fair argument that demolition will have
8

9 significant environmental impacts, including, inter alia, impacts relating to

10 historic resources, aesthetics and views, inconsistencies with the Town Municipal

11 Code and adopted land use plans and policies, among other impacts supported by
12 substantial evidence in the e record, and CEQA thus requires preparation of an 13

14 initial study and an adequate environmental document. In light of unusual

15 circumstances and evidence of significant environmental impacts, an

16 environmental impact report is required.
17
C.
18 The Town failed to make a supported finding as to substantial evidence in the

19 record that the existing residence at 260 Crescent Road may not qualify for

20 listing in the California Register of Historic Places or justify local register listing.
21

22 Second Cause of Action

23 Violations of the Town Municipal Code

24 16. Petitioners incorporate all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.
25

26 17. The Town failed to proceed in the manner required by law and its findings

27 in support of the project's demolition permits, conditional use permits, design review,

28 variance, and minor exception are not supported by substantial evidence in the record,

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 6

1

1 in violation of the Town Municipal Code and General Plan, according to proof and as

2 supported by documents, reports, and testimony in the administrative record. The

3 Town failed to make findings reflecting its analytic route and basis for conclusions.
4

5

6 WHEREFORE, Petitioners request:

7 1. That the Court issue a peremptory writ of mandate ordering the Town to
8

9 set aside and void all approvals relating to the 260 Crescent Road Residential project

10 and to refrain from further consideration of project approval until it fully complies with

11 CEQA by preparing an adequate EIR and adopting feasible alternatives and mitigation

12 measures for a project that fully complies with the Municipal Code and General Plan;
13

14 2. That the Court enjoin the Town and real parties in interest and their

15 employees and agents from project construction activities while the petition is pending;

16 3. For petitioners' costs and attorney fees pursuant to Code of Civil
17

18 Procedure section 1021.5; and

19 4. For other and further relief as the Court finds proper.
