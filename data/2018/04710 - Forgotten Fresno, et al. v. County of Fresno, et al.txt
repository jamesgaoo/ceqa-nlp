PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. Petitioners are representatives of the community west of State Route 99 between
3 the San Joaquin River and West Shields Avenue. Petitioners' community lies along the
4 jurisdictional boundary of the City of Fresno and the County of Fresno. Over the years,
5 development within Petitioners' community has outpaced critical infrastructure and services,
6 including adequate roadways, emergency services, and parks. Petitioners' community is
7 overburdened with severe traffic congestion and unsafe conditions on local roadways. For these
8 reasons, Petitioners refer to their community as "Forgotten Fresno."
9 2. This action challenges the October 23, 2018, decision of the Fresno County Board
10 of Supervisors (the "Board") to approve a Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND") for Initial
11 Study Application No. 7359, General Plan Amendment Application No. 552, and Amendment
12 Application No. 3852 for an animal shelter (the "Project"). The Project would place an
13 industrial land use in a residential neighborhood where development has far outpaced
14 infrastructure and resources necessary to support the existing community. This Verified
15 Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (*Petition")
16 challenges the Board's reliance on an MND that is deeply flawed.
17 3. In its evaluation of the Project, Respondents, among other things, failed to ensure
18 the MND disclosed, analyzed, and mitigated the Project's many foreseeable public health and
19 environmental impacts as required by the California Environment Quality Act ("CEQA")
20 pursuant to Public Resources Code sections 21000 et seq., and the CEQA Guidelines, Title 14,
21 California Code of Regulations sections 15000 et seq.
22 4. The County also failed to ensure the industrial uses of the land were consistent
23 with the policies and objectives of the County's own General Plan.

24 5. Petitioners thus seck the following: (1) a writ of mandate pursuant to Sections
25 21080 and 21080.5 of the Public Resources Code and Sections 1085 and 1094.5 of the Code of
26 Civil Procedure setting aside certain decisions made by Respondents described below and to
27 enforce compliance with CEQA; (2) a writ of mandate pursuant due to Respondents' failure to
28 comply with State Planning and Zoning Law; (3) a declaratory judgment pursuant to Section
I {8232/002/00937020.DOCX} 2
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 1060 of the Code of Civil Procedure; and (4) injunctive relief pursuant to Sections 525-526 of
2 the Code of Civil Procedure to obtain compliance with CEQA and Section 65000, et seq., of the
3 Government Code.

4 PARTIES, JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5 6. Petitioner and Plaintiff Forgotten Fresno is a California Nonprofit Public Benefit

6 Corporation based in Fresno, California. Forgotten Fresno is dedicated to improving the
7 infrastructure and well-being of Northwest Fresno and Northwest Fresno County

8 neighborhoods. Several members of Forgotten Fresno reside in the area affected by the
9 proposed Project's environmental impacts. Although Forgotten Fresno was not organized at the
10 time of the administrative proceedings for the proposed Project, several of its members made
11 objections in writing or orally prior to the close of the public hearing evaluating the project held
12 by the County of Fresno on October 23, 2018. The maintenance and prosecution of this action
13 will a confer a substantial benefit on the public by protecting the public from the environmental
14 and other harms alleged herein and by ensuring that the County abides by the procedures
15 required under law in approving development projects like the one at issue here. Forgotten
16 is Fresno is beneficially interested in this matter because it has a direct interest in ensuring that the
17 Respondents fulfill their duties to comply with CEQA, State law, and the County's own
18 ordinance code. Forgotten Fresno has an interest in preserving and protecting, for the general
19 public, the environment and character of Northwest Fresno.

20 7. Petitioner and Plaintiff Gonzalo Arias, Jr., is a resident of Northwest Fresno who
21 lives within the neighborhood directly west of the site proposed for the Project and relies on the
22 same roads, intersections, and other infrastructure supporting the proposed Project. As such,
23 Petitioner Arias is beneficially interested in the Project's impact on roads, infrastructure, and the
24 surrounding community. Petitioner Arias participated in the administrative process leading up
25 to the Board's approval of the proposed Project by making oral objections at the Project hearing
26 before the Fresno County Board of Supervisors on October 23, 2018.
27 8. Petitioner and Plaintiff Roger Day is a resident of Northwest Fresno who lives
28 within the neighborhood directly west of the site proposed for the Project and relies on the same

Il (8232/002/00937020.DOCX} 3
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 roads, intersections, and other infrastructure supporting the proposed Project. As such,
2 Petitioner Day is beneficially interested in the Project's future environmental impact on roads,
3 infrastructure, and the surrounding community. Petitioner Day participated in the
4 administrative process leading up to the Board's approval of the proposed Project by making
5 oral objections at the Project hearing before the Fresno County Board of Supervisors on October
6 23, 2018.

7 9. Petitioner and Plaintiff Elisa Bilios is a resident of Northwest Fresno who lives

8 within the neighborhood directly west of the site proposed for the Project and relies on the same
9 roads, intersections, and other infrastructure supporting the proposed Project. As such,
10 Petitioner Bilios is beneficially interested in the Project's future environmental impact on roads,
11 infrastructure, and the surrounding community. Petitioner Bilios participated in the
12 administrative process leading up to the Board's approval of the proposed Project by making
13 oral objections at the Project hearing before the Fresno County Board of Supervisors on October
14 23, 2018.

15 10. Respondent the County of Fresno is a charter county in the State of California
16 responsible for administering and carrying out its laws and applicable state laws. The County is
17 the "lead agency" for conducting the environmental review of the proposed Project for the
18 purposes of Public Resources Code section 21067. The County must comply with CEQA, state
19 law, and its own ordinances.

20 11. Respondent Fresno County Board of Supervisors is, and at all times herein
21 mentioned was, the duly elected decision-making body of Respondent Fresno County. As the
22 decision making body, the Board was charged with responsibilities under CEQA for conducting
23 a proper review of the proposed action's environmental impacts and granting the various
24 approvals necessary for the project.
25 12. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that Real Party in
26 Interest Wesclo, L.P. is, and at all times herein mentioned was, the land owner of the lot
27 property where the proposed Project is to be located.

28 ///

{8232/002/00937020.DOCX}
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 13. Petitioners are also informed and believe, and thereon allege, that Real Party in
2 Interest Fresno Humane Animal Services is, and at all times herein mentioned was, the
3 applicant for the approvals granted by the County for the proposed shelter.
4 14. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents
5 fictitiously named Does 1 through 20 and sues such respondents by fictitious names.
6 Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that the fictitiously named
7 respondents are also responsible for the actions described in this Petition. When the true

8 identities and capacities of these Respondents have been determined, Petitioners will amend
9 this petition, with leave of the court if necessary, to insert such identities and capacities.
10 15. Petitioners and/or their members have performed any and all conditions precedent
11 to the filing of this Petition. Petitioners Arias, Brooks, Day, and Bilios exhausted any and all
12 administrative remedies required by law by, inter alia, participating in the administrative and
13 environmental review process both in writing and orally at the October 23, 2018 hearing before
14 the Fresno County Board of Supervisors. Although Petitioner Forgotten Fresno was formed
15 after the administrative proceedings concluded, several members of Forgotten Fresno timely
16 objected and exhausted any and all administrative remedies required by law by, inter alia,
17 participating in the administrative review process in writing or orally at the October 23, 2018
18 hearing before the Board. This participation is acknowledged in Petitioner's October 22, 2018,
19 letter from Petitioners to the Clerk to the Board of Supervisors of Fresno County and the Senior
20 Planner of the Development Services and Capital Projects Division in the Fresno County
21 Department of Public Works and Planning, regarding the Respondents' determination of the
22 Project application.
23 16. Petitioners complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code § 21167.5
2.4 by mailing written notice of this action to Respondents. A copy of the letter providing written
25 notice to Respondents, and proofs of service of the letter, are attached hereto as Exhibit "A."
26 17. A copy of this Petition will be served on the Attorney General concurrently with
27 the filing of this Petition pursuant to Section 388 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
28 ///

{8232/002/00937020.DOCX} S

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 18. Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code § 21167.6 by filing a
2 request concerning the preparation of the record of administrative proceedings relating to this
3 action concurrently with this Petition, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit "B."
4 19. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary
5 law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside
6 their adoption of the MND and approvals for the Project. In the absence of such remedies,

7 Respondents' approvals will remain in effect in violation of state law, and the environment,
8 Petitioners and other residents within the vicinity of the Project will be irreparably harmed. No
9 money damages or legal remedy could adequately compensate Petitioners and those residents
10 and property owners for that harm.
11 20. Sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code and sections 1085 and
12 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure provide for review in this Court of actions by state
13 agencies and officers to determine whether those actions comply with CEQA. Sections 525-526
14 of the Code of Civil Procedure provide for an injunction when it appears that Petitioners are
15 entitled to the relief sought, and section 1060 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides for
16 judicial declaration of Petitioners' rights and Respondents' duties. Accordingly, and based on
17 the facts stated in this Petition, this Court has jurisdiction to grant declaratory and injunctive
18 relief and to issue a writ of mandate on the claims presented here.
19 21. Venue in Fresno County Superior Court is proper pursuant to section 394 of the
20 Code of Civil Procedure. The County and the Board that approved the Project are located
21 within the County of Fresno, and the Project at issue is located within the jurisdictional
22 boundaries of the County of Fresno.
23 STATEMENT OF FACTS

24 22. The Project site is located in a rural residential neighborhood west of Ilighway 99
25 where Fresno County borders the Northwest corner of Fresno City. The site for the proposed
26 Project is an undeveloped 4.14 a acre lot in a Rural Residential ("R-R") zoned District "intended
27 to create or preserve rural or very large lot residential homesites where a limited range of
28 agricultural activities may be conducted." (Fresno County Ord. § 820.) Prior to the October 23,

{8232/002/00937020.DOCX} 6
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 2018, hearing, the lot had a land use designation of Rural-Residential under the County's
2 General Plan, and was zoned Rural-Residential since 1976. The property is bordered by North
3 Grantland Avenue to the West, State Route 99 to the East, churches to the north, and the Dante

4 Club of Fresno and a residential home to the South. The immediate area surrounding the
5 property consists of R-R zoned single-family residences, churches, a social venue, and the

6 Herndon-Barstow elementary school.

7 23. Rapid development of Northwest Fresno west of Highway 99 over the last decade
8 has significantly outpaced the development of local infrastructure. Access between the

9 proposed Project and northwest Fresno is either Herndon Avenue to the north or Shaw Avenue
10 to the south. Due to the varied nature of the Fresno County and Fresno City agencies with
11 jurisdiction over land use and roadway in the proposed site area, local infrastructure has been
12 developed in a manner that is haphazard, resulting in a lack of parks, gridlock on local roadways
13 particularly Grantland Avenue, Parkway Drive, and Herndon Avenue. The surrounding land
14 uses - predominantly "sensitive receptors" such as single-family homes, schools, and churches
15 - bear the burden of the additional emissions and environmental impacts caused by the
16 inadequate infrastructure.
17 24. On or about July 31, 2017, Real Parties in Interest filed Initial Study Application
18 No. 7359 a seeking a development permit to construct 30,924 square foot animal shelter in six
19 different buildings on the site. Industrial development such as animal shelters, however, is
20 expressly prohibited by the Fresno County Ordinance Code on Rural Residential land. (Fresno
21 County Ordinance § 820.4.) Thus, the applicant filed General Plan Amendment No. 552 to
22 amend the lot's General Plan designation from "Rural Residential" to "Light Industrial" and
23 Amendment Application No. 3852 to change the zoning from R-R(nb) (Rural Residential,
24 Neighborhood Beautification Overlay) to M-1(c) (Light Manufacturing, Conditional) to allow
25 for an animal shelter by-right.

26 25. On or about June 8, 2018, County staff released the MND for the Project. The
27 County determined that although the Project was within close proximity to numerous residences
28 and other sensitive receptors, the Project would have no significant, unmitigated environmental

II {8232/002/00937020.DOCX)
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

impacts. The County made these findings despite the fact that the applicants had not proposed a
2 specific facility for the environmental review.

3 26. Public comments submitted by neighbors to Respondents highlighted deficiencies
4 in the MND. For instance, commenting parties noted the MND proposed to grant a by-right use
5 to build an animal shelter without proposing a specific facility, resulting in an incomplete
6 environmental analysis. The comments also noted the MND describes design features of the
7 Project to mitigate significant odor, noise, and traffic impacts without adequately discussing the
8 severity of the impact prior to mitigation and without making the mitigation measures as
9 binding. Comments also highlighted how the traffic report severely truncated its review by
10 focusing on a single intersection of traffic at Parkway Avenue and Grantland and did not
11 incorporate evidence of current conditions which already exceed the anticipated peak
12 congestion projected by the report.
13 27. On October 22, 2018, the Board held a hearing as to whether to approve the
14 application for the Project. Members of Forgotten Fresno, as well as the individually-named
15 Petitioners, raised numerous concerr about the inadequacy of the environmental review and
16 impact of the traffic, noise, odors, lights and other adverse impacts.
17 28. On October 23, 2018, despite the written and oral concerns about the Project, and
18 Respondents' failure to comply with their obligations under CEQA, the Board adopted the
19 MND and approved the Project.
20 CAUSES OF ACTION

21 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

22 Fair Argument of Significant Impacts in Violations of CEQA
23 29. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the precedent paragraphs 1 to
24 28 in their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
25 30. CEQA was adopted by the Legislature to prevent environmental harm while
26 providing a decent home and satisfying living for every Californian. The policies and
27 legislative intent behind CEQA are intended to be an integral party of any public agency's
28 ///

{8232/002/00937020.DOCX} 8
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

L

2 decisionmaking process. CEQA applies to discretionary projects approved by public agencies,

3 including amending zoning ordinances and general plans.
31.

4 The County was the lead agency under CEQA to evaluate the environmental

5 impacts of the Project under CEQA. As part of this duty, Respondents are required to

6 prepare an environmental impact report when substantial evidence in the record supports a

7 fair argument that a project may have a significant impact on the environment.

8 32. CEQA also required Respondents to adopt feasible mitigation measures to

9 reduce or avoid any significant environmental impacts. If substantial evidence in the record

10 supports a fair argument that a project's significant environmental impacts could not be

11 mitigated to a less than significant level, the County must prepare a full environmental

12 impact report instead of a mitigated negative declaration.
33.

13 Respondents' approval of a development permit constitutes a discretionary act
that triggers its obligation to comply with CEQA.

14

15 34. Respondents violated CEQA by approving the Project because, based on the

16 record, Respondents failed to adequately evaluate and mitigate the Project impacts that may
be significant, including, but not limited to:

17

18 35. Impacts to Traffic. For the following reasons, the traffic study prepared for

19 the Project was deeply flawed, and a fair argument exists that the Project would result in
significant impacts to traffic and transportation:
20

21 a. The MND fails to adequately analyze and mitigate the traffic and

22 traffic safety impacts of the project. The traffic study, for instance,
included an artificially narrow
23 scope that limited analysis to one

24 intersection - Parkway Drive/Grantland Avenue - notwithstanding

25 substantial credible evidence that the Project would result in

26 significant effects at other nearby congested intersections and
roadway segments.
27

28 b. The traffic study significantly understates the trip generation
estimations for the Project and are without basis in fact. More

|| {8232/002/00937020.DOCX} 9
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

accurate figures show the Project would have significant
2 environmental effects.

c. The trip generation figures in the traffic study are erroneous
4 because they are based on a site plan that is erroneous, and subject
5 to change. More accurate trip generation figures reveal the Project
6 would have significant environmental effects.

7 d. The traffic study is erroneous because it is not based on real-world

8 conditions. As explained by Petitioners' traffic expert, the
9 conclusions in Respondents' traffic study are not consistent with on
10 the ground conditions, which reveal the surrounding intersections
11 operate less efficiently than the theoretical calculations presume. An
12 analysis of real-world conditions demonstrates the Project would have
13 significant environmental effects.
14 e. The traffic study offers erroneous information and evidence
15 concerning 2035 conditions, including the conclusion that the
16 Parkway/Grantland intersection will operate an acceptable levels of
17 service during p.m. peak hour conditions, which is inconsistent with
18 data from Caltrans and the City of Fresno in a recent environmental
19 document. When such information and evidence is taken into account,
20 it is plain the Project would result in potentially significant
21 environmental effects.

22 f. The Herndon/S.R. 99 Southbound offramp interchange is currently
23 operating at an unacceptable LOS (LOS E in a.m. peak hours and LOS
24 F in p.m. peak hours). The same is true for cumulative conditions.
25 Virtually all motorists making a left-hand turn onto Parkway Drive
26 will traverse this intersection. The Project will exacerbate these
27 unacceptable conditions under both existing conditions and 2035
28 conditions.

Il {8232/002/00937020.DOCX} 10
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1

2 g. There is no direct way to

3 travel southbound from the Project site.

A Rather, to travel southbound, a vehicle would need to make a left-hand

turn on

un Parkway Drive, and travel through the residential

6 neighborhood to the west via Menlo, Annapolis, and Tenaya.

7 h. Photographs and videos of existing conditions show queuing for the

8 northbound/left movement extending past Tenaya Avenue, which is

o intersection.

i. over 700 feet to the south, and blocks the Tenaya/Grantland

10

11 Photographs and videos of existing conditions show queuing for the

12 j. northbound/right movement extending far past the 295 feet stated as
the queuing capacity in the traffic study.

13

14 Photographs and videos show motorists traveling northbound on

15 Grantland creating unsafe conditions by bypassing traffic on the dirt to

16 make a right-hand turning movement onto Parkway Drive/S.R. 99.

17 k. Photographs and videos show the Tenaya/Grantland Avenue

18 intersection operating at an unacceptable level of service during a.m.

19 peak hours. This is because motorists seeking to make a left-hand

20 turning movement from Tenaya Avenue onto Grantland are restricted

21 from making a left-hand turn movement onto Grantland due to

22 excessive queueing northbound on Grantland. The Project will

23 exacerbate these unacceptable conditions because (i) vehicles seeking

24 to enter the Project from southbound Grantland will be required to

25 a make a U-Turn at Tenaya Avenue, and (ii) vehicles seeking to travel

26 from the Project southbound on Grantland will be required to turn

27 north onto Grantland, and then route through the neighborhood, and
make a right-hand turn onto Grantland.

28 1. According to Central Unified School District, traffic conditions
poor in the morning hours, and increases in traffic from the Project

II {8232/002/00937020.DOCX) are

11
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- would exacerbate those

2 unacceptable conditions. To avoid traffic

3 safety issues resulting from the need for students to cross the street, the

4 County should require that the Project install traffic mitigation

5 measures in the form of controlled intersections for children to cross
Grantland Avenue and have a clear a path of travel

6 36.

7 Noise. A fair argument exists that the Project would result in significant impacts

8 to sensitive nearby receptors, and would result in noise levels in excess of the County Code.

9 Respondents' noise study is erroneous because it presumes the construction of the Project |

10 would occur in a particular way, and does not address proximate nearby sensitive receptors.
37. Odors.

11 The IS/MND concedes the Project "has the potential to cause

12 objectionable odors from the use as an animal hospital and shelter," yet there is no binding

13 mitigation to avoid such potentially significant impacts. Rather, Respondents and the applicants

14 rely on non-binding project features to suggest no significant impact would occur. As such, a

15 fair argument exists that the Project would result in significant environmental effects.

16 38. Aesthetics. A fair argument exists that the Project would result in significant

17 aesthetic impacts. The County recognized the Project had the potential to create significant

18 impacts to aesthetics, and thus originally recommended that the Project incorporate a "six (6)

19 foot high solid masonry wall" along the property lines adjacent to Rural Residential Zone

20 Districts. The applicant, however, declined to incorporate this mitigation measure, leaving

21 recognized aesthetic impacts unmitigated. Because a mitigated negative declaration is only

22 appropriate where the applicant agreed to eliminate or avoid all potentially significant

23 environmental impacts by incorporating mitigation measures into the project, (see Pub.

24 Resources Code, §§ 21064.5, 21080, subd. (c)(2); CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15064(f)(2),
15070(b)), the adoption of the IS/MND was unlawful.

25 39. Public Safety.

26 fair argument also exists that the Project could result in

27 public safety impacts associated with animals being unlawfully abandoned at the shelter.
Indeed, data from similar organizations suggests more than one animal per day is abandoned
28 unlawfully. Central Unified School District has also expressed concerns regarding this

|l {8232/002/00937020.DOCX} 12
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

a

2 issue, due to the proximity of the Project an Elementary School. Despite this, the impact

3 was left unmitigated. As such, a fair argument exists that the Project would have significant
impacts to public safety.

4

5 40. Land Use Impacts. CEQA requires agencies to evaluate whether a proposed a
development project will, among other things, conflict with any land use plan, policy, or

7 regulation of an agency with jurisdiction over project. A fair argument exists that the Project
as proposed will result in several conflicts with both the County's General Plan and the Zoning

9 Code. First, the Project seeks to bring an industrial land use into an area that is predominantly

10 rural residential. This conflicts with both sound land use principles, as industrial land uses are

11 typically incompatible with residential land uses, particularly when they are adjacent to each

12 other. In addition, as explained in Paragraphs 74 through 78 below, the Project is inconsistent

13 with several policies and programs articulated in the County's General Plan.

14 41. The County violated CEQA by failing to prepare an EIR for the Project when

15 the record demonstrates that the Project may cause the potentially significant environmental

16 impacts described above, among others, which have not been adequately disclosed,
analyzed, or mitigated to a less than significant level.

17 42.

18 Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion, and failed to proceed in a

19 manner required by law, by approving a mitigated negative declaration despite the presence

20 of a fair argument that the Project would have significant environmental effects. Thus,

21 Respondents abused their discretion by failing to prepare an environmental impact report to
address the significant environmental impacts.
22 43. Petitioners have

23 clear, present and beneficial right to performance by

24 Respondents of their duties under CEQA, and Respondents have the duty and capacity to

25 perform their duties under CEQA as the lead agency of the Project. Petitioners also have a

26 clear, present, and beneficial interest in the issuance of a writ of mandate as they are and will be
adversely affected by Respondents' violations of CEQA.
27 The failure of Respondents to

28 perform their duties under the law requires this Court to issue a writ of mandate a directing them

3 Resources Code and Sections 1085 and 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

4

5 44. Failure to Analyze Cumulative Impacts Violates CEQA

6 Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the precedent paragraphs 1 to
43 in their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
45. CEQA requires an agency to prepare an EIR for a project whenever substantial

9 evidence in the record supports a fair argument that a project may have a significant impact on
the environment.

10 46.

11 CEQA requires a significant effect on the environment be found if the possible

12 effects of a project are individually limited, but cumulatively considerable. Cumulatively
considerable effects include

13 past, current, and probable future projects. Failure to eliminate or

14 avoid all potentially significant environmental impacts can invalidate an MND.

15 47. The County also violated CEQA when it approved the Industrial Project

16 before failing to adequate analyze the cumulative impacts of the Project. Together with the

17 impacts of other past, present and future projects, the impacts of the Project make an

18 incremental contribution and create a cumulatively considerable impact in violation of
CEQA and CEQA Guidelines section 15130(a):
19

20 a. Traffic at Tenaya Avenue and North Grantland Avenue is already

21 operating at an unacceptable level, and the Project will exacerbate
these unacceptable conditions.

22

23 b. Only Herndon Avenue and Shaw Avenue provide access to the

24 Project site to Northwest Fresno, and several key intersections

25 within the vicinity of the Project are projected to operate an

26 unacceptable levels by 2035, including, but not limited to:

27 Northbound Highway 99 off-ramp at Herndon Avenue; Herndon

28 Avenue and North Parkway Drive; the intersection of North
Parkway Drive, North Grantland Avenue, and the

Il (8232/002/00937020.DOCX} onramp to

14
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 Highway 99; and Herndon Avenue and Golden State Highway. The
2 Project will result in additional vehicle trips traversing each of the
3 above intersections, thus contributing to cumulatively considerable
4 conditions exacerbating the 2035 anticipated conditions.

5 c. While the MND calculates the Project's fair share contributions for
6 certain roadway improvements to Grantland Avenue over time,
7 there are no binding conditions to install any improvements or pay
8 the fair share of improvements, leaving the impacts to the above

9 intersections unmitigated.

10 48. Therefore, there is a fair argument the incremental contributions of the Project's
11 traffic will result in a cumulatively considerable condition resulting in a significant impact.
12 49. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by taking the above-described
13 actions in violation of CEQA. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law,
14 and Respondents' decisions were not supported by substantial evidence in the record.
15 Respondents further violated CEQA by failing to independently review and analyze the effects
16 of their actions prior to approving and implementing those actions. The failure of Respondents
17 to perform their duties under the law requires this Court to issue a writ of mandate directing
18 them to discharge their duties under CEQA, pursuant to Sections 21080 and 21080.5 of the
19 Public Resources Code and Sections 1085 and 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

20 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

21 Piecemealing/Segmentation of Environmental Review in Violation of CEQA
22 50. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the precedent paragraphs 1 to
23 49 in their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
24 51. A project for CEQA purposes is "the whole of an action." An environmental
25 review must encompass and consider the whole of the project, rather than only pieces at a time,
26 prior to an agency approving or implementing any portion of the project or regulation.
27 52. Respondents impermissibly divided their consideration of the Project into several
28 separate reviews by failing to consider a specific site plan in the Initial Study or Mitigated

{8232/002/00937020.DOCX} 15
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 Negative Declaration. The County simply presumed that potential impacts of the Project would
2 be lessened or avoided through design features and project-specific actions, but did not in its
3 approval of the Project actually require that the Project be designed in any particular way. This
4 is of particular concern because any future site plan - regardless of whether it incorporates the
5 project features discussed in the environmental document - could be considered a ministerial a

6 approval outside the scope of CEQA.
7 53. By disaggregating the environmental review for the Project with the review of any
8 future site plan, Respondents have segmented environmental review in violation of CEQA.
9 The impacts of the site plan of the Project rely heavily on the design, location, construction, and
10 subsequent operation of the shelter facility. Full environmental review and consideration of the
11 Project must be considered before Respondents determine the applicants can build an animal
12 shelter by-right that also complies with CEQA.
13 54. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by taking the above-described
14 actions in violation of CEQA. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law,
15 and Respondents' decisions were not supported by substantial evidence in the record.
16 Respondents further violated CEQA by failing to independently review and analyze the effects
17 of their actions prior to approving and implementing those actions.
18 55. Petitioners also have a clear, present and beneficial interest in the issuance of :
19 writ of mandate by virtue of the facts set forth in this Petition, in that they are and will continue
20 to be adversely affected by Respondents' continuing violations of CEQA. The failure of
21 Respondents to perform their duties under the law requires this Court to issue a writ of mandate
22 directing them to discharge their duties under CEQA, pursuant to Sections 21080 and 21080.5
23 of the Public Resources Code and Sections 1085 and 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
24 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

25 Inadequate and Incomplete Project Description
26 56. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the precedent paragraphs 1 to
27 55 in their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
28 ///

{8232/002/00937020.DOCX} 16
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 57. To adequately and accurately assess the potential effects of any project, CEQA
2 requires that the lead agency prepare project description that includes reasonably foreseeable
3 future activities that are consequences of the project. In addition, the entire project being
4 proposed (and not some smaller aspect of it), must be described in the environmental document.

5 The above requirements reflects the CEQA Guideline's definition of a "project" as the "whole

6 of an action." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15378.)

7 58. In this case, the Project considered by the County was simply a rezone and
8 general plan amendment. The IS/MND, however, discussed a different project -i.e., a site plan
9 that was not before Respondents for consideration. Indeed, it appears the site plan will change
10 because the current design shows the parking lot in a public right of way. Moreover, the MND
11 does not describe the whole of the action, but rather a future hypothetical facility that has not
12 been specifically proposed or committed to.
13 59. By proceeding in this manner, Respondents failed to prepare a project description
14 that includes reasonably foreseeable future activities that are consequences of the project, an
15 also failed to describe the entire project being proposed.
16 60. Respondents therefore prejudicially abused their discretion by taking the above-
17 described actions in violation of CEQA. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required
18 by law, and Respondents' decisions were not supported by substantial evidence in the record.
19 Respondents further violated CEQA by failing to independently review and analyze the effects
20 of their actions prior to approving and implementing those actions. The failure of Respondents
21 to perform their duties under the law requires this Court to issue a writ of mandate directing
22 them to discharge their duties under CEQA, pursuant to Sections 21080 and 21080.5 of the
23 Public Resources Code and Sections 1085 and 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

24 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

25 Failure to Analyze/Mitigate Significant Environmental Effects
26 61. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the precedent paragraphs 1 to
27 60 in their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
28 ///

{8232/002/00937020.DOCX} 17
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

62. CEQA requires a lead agency to first determine the full extent of a project's

2 impacts before it may apply mitigation measures to reduce those impacts. A lead agency may
not avoid analysis by simply presuming design feature will be incorporated into the project to

4 lessen an environmental effect, without any binding commitment to ensure the design feature

5 will be implemented.

6 63. Following a full and adequate review a of a project's potential environmental

7 effects, the lead agency must bind itself and/or the applicant to ensure mitigation will actually

8 occur through conditions of approval, contracts, or other methods. This requirement is intended

9 to ensure that mitigation measures will actually be implemented, not merely adopted and then

10 ignored.

11 64. In this case, the MND simply asserted the applicant would incorporate various
12 design features into the Project that were intended to prevent the occurrence of or minimize the
13 significance of adverse environmental effects. The MND then relied upon these alleged design
14 features to assert that the Project would not result in significant impacts as to, inter alia, odors,

15 aesthetics, noise, and traffic, without discussing the severity of the impact prior to mitigation,
16 and without incorporating the alleged design features as binding mitigation measures.

17 65. By proceeding in this fashion, Respondents impermissibly (i) side-stepped

18 analysis of the Project's potentially significant environmental effects, and (ii) failed to adopt

19 binding mitigation necessary to ensure those effects would not occur. This is impermissible

20 under CEQA. (Lotus v. Dept. of Trans. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 645, 651-52.)
21 66. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by taking the above-described
22 actions in violation of CEQA. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law,
23 and Respondents' decisions were not supported by substantial evidence in the record.

24 Respondents further violated CEQA by failing to independently review and analyze the effects

25 of their actions prior to approving and implementing those actions. Respondents' failure to
26 perform their duties under the law requires this Court to issue a writ of mandate directing them
27 to discharge their duties under CEQA, pursuant to Sections 21080 and 21080.5 of the Public
28 Resources Code and Sections 1085 and 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

1 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 Failure to Recirculate MND in Violation of CEQA

3 67. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the precedent paragraphs 1 to
4 66 in their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

5 68. If, after circulation of an initial study, mitigation measures are changed, the initial

6 study should be recirculated for additional public review and opportunity to comment.
7 69. Here, the initial study originally contemplated a mitigation measure in the form of
8 a six-foot high masonry wall to avoid or eliminate the aesthetic and noise impacts of the project.

9 70. This mitigation measure was eliminated after the original circulation of the MND.
10 As conceded in the MND, the masonry wall was designed to avoid or lessen the Project's
11 environmental effects; in other words, the lack of a masonry wall would lead to adverse noise,
12 odor, and other substantial adverse impacts for the surrounding properties, residences, churches,
13 and school.

14 71. Despite the removal of the mitigation measure, the County failed to recirculate the to
15 MND for public review and comment before considering the Project for approval.
16 72. Respondents therefore prejudicially abused their discretion by taking the above-
17 described actions in violation of CEQA. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required
18 by law, and Respondents' decisions were not supported by substantial evidence in the record.
19 Respondents further violated CEQA by failing to independently review and analyze the effects
20 of their actions prior to approving and implementing those actions. Respondents' failure to
21 perform their duties under the law requires this Court to issue a writ of mandate directing them
22 to discharge their duties under CEQA, pursuant to Sections 21080 and 21080.5 of the Public

23 Resources Code and Sections 1085 and 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

24 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

25 Inconsistency with the Fresno County General Plan
26 73. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the precedent paragraphs 1 to
27 72 in their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

28 ///

{8232/002/00937020.DOCX} 19
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

74. State planning and zoning law requires that all land-use decisions of counties
2 must be consistent with the county's General Plan. (Govt. Code, § 65860, subd. (a); see also
3 Corona-Norco Unif. Sch. Dist. v. City of Corona (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 985, 994.) A "project
4 is consistent with the general plan if, considering all its aspects, it will further the objectives and
5 policies of the general plan and not obstruct their attainment." (Corona-Norco, supra, 17
6 Cal.App.4th at 994.)

7 75. "A project is inconsistent if it conflicts with a general plan policy that is
8 fundamental, mandatory, and clear." (Endangered Habitats League, Inc. V. County of Orange
9 (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 777, 782.)
10 76. Despite this requirement, the Project is inconsistent with numerous provisions of
11 the Fresno County General Plan, including:
12 a. Failure to identify, much less require, operational measures or
13 specialized equipment to protect public health, safety, and welfare and
14 to reduce adverse impacts of noise, odor, vibration, smoke, noxious
15 gases, heat and glare, dust and dirt, combustables, and other pollutants
16 on the property.
17 b. Failure to identify and require the Project applicants to maintain non-
18 objectionable use areas adjacent to or surrounding the shelter to isolate
19 adverse impacts from impacting the abutting church, commercial
20 properties, and residences.
21 C. Failure to identify, much less require, any project limits for the size,
22 time of operation, or length of permit for any function of the project.
23 d. Failure to identify any meaningful facility designs, traffic control
24 devices, or road upgrades to manage the industrial traffic going to or
25 coming from the Project.

26 e. Planning an industrial building in a rural residential neighborhood with
27 already-overburdened infrastructure that is not well planned to
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

P adequately serve or further the countywide economic development
2 goals related to the shelter.
W f. Failing to minimize potential land use conflicts between the Project's
4 urban development and the existing rural-residential areas by
5 mandating buffers or graduated transitions between the Project and the

6 surrounding residences, church, and social hall.

7 g. Failing to protect residential and other noise-sensitive uses such as
8 churches and schools from exposure to harmful or annoying noise
9 levels or to develop a policy framework to achieve a healthful noise
10 environment.

11 h. Failing to require design elements necessary to fully minimize the
12 adverse noise impacts on the surrounding residences, churches, and
13 elementary school.

14 77. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by taking the above-described
15 actions in violation of CEQA and the County of Fresno General Plan. Respondents failed to
16 proceed in the manner required by law, and Respondents' decisions were not supported by
17 substantial evidence in the record. Respondents further violated CEQA by failing to
18 independently review and analyze the effects of their actions prior to approving and
19 implementing those actions. Pursuant to section 65000, et seq., of the Government Code,
20 Petitioners are entitled to petition this Court for a writ a of mandate enjoining Respondents to
21 comply with State Planning and Zoning Law.

22 EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION

23 Declaratory Relief
24 78. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the precedent paragraphs to
25 77 in their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
26 79. With respect to the violations of law alleged in the First through Seventh Causes
27 of Action, there exists a clear and actual a controversy between Petitioners and Respondents
28 regarding Respondents' failures to comply with CEQA, the Fresno County General Plan, and

{8232/002/00937020.DOCX} 21
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 the Fresno County Ordinance Code. Petitioners contend that Respondents have not complied
2 with CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, the Fresno County General Plan, and Fresno County
3 Ordinance Code, while Respondents contend that they have done so.
4 80. To remedy these violations of law, Petitioners request a declaration of the duties
5 of Respondents under CEQA, State Planning and Zoning Law, the Fresno County General Plan,
6 and Fresno County Ordinance Code, and a declaration that Respondents have not complied with
7 its duties under those provisions. Such declarations are a necessary and proper exercise of this
8 Court's power under section 1060 of the Code of Civil Procedure and under section 65000 of
9 the Government Code, to prevent violation of the Government Code, which requires that all
10 valid regulations shall be made "in accordance with standards prescribed by other provisions of
11 law."

12 PRAYER FOR RELIEF
13 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as follows:
14 1. a For a peremptory writ of mandate pursuant to CEQA and the Code of Civil
15 Procedure section 1085 and Public Resources Code 21168.5, or, in the alternative, Code of Civil
16 Procedure section 1094.5 and Public Resources Code 21168.5, directing Respondents to vacate
17 and set aside their approval of the MND, General Plan Amendment, and Zoning Amendment
18 for the Project;

19 2. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents to comply with the
20 requirements of CEQA and take any other action required by the Public Resources Code
21 Section 21168.9, comply with the requirements of the County of Fresno General Plan, and
22 comply with the Fresno County Ordinance Code.
23 3. For declaratory relief under CEQA and the Code of Civil Procedure with respect
24 to the violations of law alleged in Petitioners' First through Fifth Causes of Action, as specified
25 in Petitioners' Sixth Cause of Action.

26 4. On Petitioners' First through Seventh Causes of Action, a temporary restraining

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

INTRODUCTION

2 1. Petitioners are representatives of the community west of State Route 99 between

3 the San Joaquin River and West Shields Avenue. Petitioners' community lies along the
4 jurisdictional boundary of the City of Fresno and the County of Fresno. Over the years,

5 development within Petitioners' community has outpaced critical infrastructure and services,

6 including adequate roadways, emergency services, and parks. Petitioners' community is

7 overburdened with severe traffic congestion and unsafe conditions on local roadways. For these

8 reasons, Petitioners refer to their community as "Forgotten Fresno."

9 2. This action challenges the October 23, 2018, decision of the Fresno County Board
10 of Supervisors (the "Board") to approve a Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND") for Initial
11 Study Application No. 7359, General Plan Amendment Application No. 552, and Amendment

12 Application No. 3852 for an animal shelter (the "Project"). The Project would place an
13 industrial land use in a residential neighborhood where development has far outpaced
14 infrastructure and resources necessary to support the existing community. This Verified
15 Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief ("Petition")
16 challenges the Board's reliance on an MND that is deeply flawed.
17 3. In its evaluation of the Project, Respondents, among other things, failed to ensure
18 the MND disclosed, analyzed, and mitigated the Project's many foreseeable public health and

19 environmental impacts as required by the California Environment Quality Act ("CEQA")
20 pursuant to Public Resources Code sections 21000 et seq., and the CEQA Guidelines, Title 14,

21 California Code of Regulations sections 15000 et seq.
22 4. The County also failed to ensure the industrial uses of the land were consistent
23 with the policies and objectives of the County's own General Plan.

24 5. Petitioners thus seek the following: (1) a writ of mandate pursuant to Sections
25 21080 and 21080.5 of the Public Resources Code and Sections 1085 and 1094.5 of the Code of

26 Civil Procedure setting aside certain decisions made by Respondents described below and to
27 enforce compliance with CEQA; (2) a writ of mandate pursuant due to Respondents' failure to
28 comply with State Planning and Zoning Law; (3) a declaratory judgment pursuant to Section

{8232/002/00937020.DOCX} 2

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1060 of the Code of Civil Procedure; and (4) injunctive relief pursuant to Sections 525-526 of

2 the Code of Civil Procedure to obtain compliance with CEQA and Section 65000, et seq., of the
3 Government Code.

4 PARTIES, JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5 6. Petitioner and Plaintiff Forgotten Fresno is a California Nonprofit Public Benefit

6 Corporation based in Fresno, California. Forgotten Fresno is dedicated to improving the
7 infrastructure and well-being of Northwest Fresno and Northwest Fresno County
neighborhoods. Several members of Forgotten Fresno reside in the area affected by the

9 proposed Project's environmental impacts. Although Forgotten Fresno was not organized at the
10 time of the administrative proceedings for the proposed Project, several of its members made
11 objections in writing or orally prior to the close of the public hearing evaluating the project held

12 by the County of Fresno on October 23, 2018. The maintenance and prosecution of this action
13 will confer a substantial benefit on the public by protecting the public from the environmental
14 and other harms alleged herein and by ensuring that the County abides by the procedures
15 required under law in approving development projects like the one at issue here. Forgotten
16 Fresno is beneficially interested in this matter because it has a direct interest in ensuring that the

17 Respondents fulfill their duties to comply with CEQA, State law, and the County's own

18 ordinance code. Forgotten Fresno has an interest in preserving and protecting, for the general

19 public, the environment and character of Northwest Fresno.

20 7. Petitioner and Plaintiff Gonzalo Arias, Jr., is a resident of Northwest Fresno who
21 lives within the neighborhood directly west of the site proposed for the Project and relies on the
22 same roads, intersections, and other infrastructure supporting the proposed Project. As such,

23 Petitioner Arias is beneficially interested in the Project's impact on roads, infrastructure, and the

24 surrounding community. Petitioner Arias participated in the administrative process leading up
25 to the Board's approval of the proposed Project by making oral objections at the Project hearing

26 before the Fresno County Board of Supervisors on October 23, 2018.

27 8. Petitioner and Plaintiff Roger Day is a resident of Northwest Fresno who lives

28 within the neighborhood directly west of the site proposed for the Project and relies on the same

{8232/002/00937020.DOCX} 3
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

roads, intersections, and other infrastructure supporting the proposed Project. As such,
2 Petitioner Day is beneficially interested in the Project's future environmental impact on roads,
3 infrastructure, and the surrounding community. Petitioner Day participated in the

4 administrative process leading up to the Board's approval of the proposed Project by making
5 oral objections at the Project hearing before the Fresno County Board of Supervisors on October

6 23, 2018.

7 9. Petitioner and Plaintiff Elisa Bilios is a resident of Northwest Fresno who lives

8 within the neighborhood directly west of the site proposed for the Project and relies on the same

9 roads, intersections, and other infrastructure supporting the proposed Project. As such,
10 Petitioner Bilios is beneficially interested in the Project's future environmental impact on roads,
11 infrastructure, and the surrounding community. Petitioner Bilios participated in the
12 administrative process leading up to the Board's approval of the proposed Project by making
13 oral objections at the Project hearing before the Fresno County Board of Supervisors on October
14 23, 2018.

15 10. Respondent the County of Fresno is a charter county in the State of California
16 responsible for administering and carrying out its laws and applicable state laws. The County is
17 the "lead agency" for conducting the environmental review of the proposed Project for the
18 purposes of Public Resources Code section 21067. The County must comply with CEQA, state
19 law, and its own ordinances.

20 11. Respondent Fresno County Board of Supervisors is, and at all times herein
21 mentioned was, the duly elected decision-making body of Respondent Fresno County. As the
22 decision making body, the Board was charged with responsibilities under CEQA for conducting
23 a proper review of the proposed action's environmental impacts and granting the various
24 approvals necessary for the project.
25 12. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that Real Party in
26 Interest Wesclo, L.P. is, and at all times herein mentioned was, the land owner of the lot
27 property where the proposed Project is to be located.
28 ///

- 13.

2 Petitioners are also informed and believe, and thereon allege, that Real Party in

3 Interest Fresno Humane Animal Services is, and at all times herein mentioned was, the
applicant for the approvals granted by the County for the proposed shelter.

4 14.

5 Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents

6 fictitiously named Does 1 through 20 and sues such respondents by fictitious names.

7 Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that the fictitiously named

8 respondents are also responsible for the actions described in this Petition. When the true

9 identities and capacities of these Respondents have been determined, Petitioners will amend

10 this petition, with leave of the court if necessary, to insert such identities and capacities.
15.

11 Petitioners and/or their members have performed any and all conditions precedent

12 to the filing of this Petition. Petitioners Arias, Brooks, Day, and Bilios exhausted any and all

13 administrative remedies required by law by, inter alia, participating in the administrative and

14 environmental review process both in writing and orally at the October 23, 2018 hearing before

15 the Fresno County Board of Supervisors. Although Petitioner Forgotten Fresno was formed

16 after the administrative proceedings concluded, several members of Forgotten Fresno timely

17 objected and exhausted any and all administrative remedies required by law by, inter alia,
participating in the administrative review

18 process in writing or orally at the October 23, 2018

19 hearing before the Board. This participation is acknowledged in Petitioner's October 22, 2018,

20 letter from Petitioners to the Clerk to the Board of Supervisors of Fresno County and the Senior

21 Planner of the Development Services and Capital Projects Division in the Fresno County

22 Department of Public Works and Planning, regarding the Respondents' determination of the
Project application.
23 16.

24 Petitioners complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code § 21167.5

25 by mailing written notice of this action to Respondents. A copy of the letter providing written

26 notice to Respondents, and proofs of service of the letter, are attached hereto as Exhibit "A."

17.

27 A copy of this Petition will be served on the Attorney General concurrently with

28 the filing of this Petition pursuant to Section 388 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
///

{8232/002/00937020.DOCX} 5

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

18. Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code § 21167.6 by filing a
2 request concerning the preparation of the record of administrative proceedings relating to this
action concurrently with this Petition, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit "B."

4 19. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary
5 law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside
their adoption of the MND and approvals for the Project. In the absence of such remedies,
7 Respondents' approvals will remain in effect in violation of state law, and the environment,
Petitioners and other residents within the vicinity of the Project will be irreparably harmed. No
9 money damages or legal remedy could adequately compensate Petitioners and those residents
10 and property owners for that harm.

11 20. Sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code and sections 1085 and
12 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure provide for review in this Court of actions by state
13 agencies and officers to determine whether those actions comply with CEQA. Sections 525-5261
14 of the Code of Civil Procedure provide for an injunction when it appears that Petitioners are
15 entitled to the relief sought, and section 1060 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides for a
16 judicial declaration of Petitioners' rights and Respondents' duties. Accordingly, and based on
17 the facts stated in this Petition, this Court has jurisdiction to grant declaratory and injunctive
18 relief and to issue a writ of mandate on the claims presented here.
19 21. Venue in Fresno County Superior Court is proper pursuant to section 394 of the
20 Code of Civil Procedure. The County and the Board that approved the Project are located
21 within the County of Fresno, and the Project at issue is located within the jurisdictional
22 boundaries of the County of Fresno.
23 STATEMENT OF FACTS

24 22. The Project site is located in a rural residential neighborhood west of Highway 99
25 where Fresno County borders the Northwest corner of Fresno City. The site for the proposed
26 Project is an undeveloped 4.14 acre lot in a Rural Residential ("R-R") zoned District "intended
27 to create or preserve rural or very large lot residential homesites where a limited range of
28 agricultural activities may be conducted." (Fresno County Ord. § 820.) Prior to the October 23,

|l {8232/002/00937020.DOCX} 6
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 2018, hearing, the lot had a land use designation of Rural-Residential under the County's

2 General Plan, and was zoned Rural-Residential since 1976. The property is bordered by North

3 Grantland Avenue to the West, State Route 99 to the East, churches to the north, and the Dante

4 Club of Fresno and a residential home to the South. The immediate area surrounding the

5 property consists of R-R zoned single-family residences, churches, a social venue, and the
6 Herndon-Barstow elementary school.

7 23. Rapid development of Northwest Fresno west of Highway 99 over the last decade
has significantly outpaced the development of local infrastructure. Access between the

9 proposed Project and northwest Fresno is either Herndon Avenue to the north or Shaw Avenue
10 to the south. Due to the varied nature of the Fresno County and Fresno City agencies with

11 jurisdiction over land use and roadway in the proposed site area, local infrastructure has been
12 developed in a manner that is haphazard, resulting in a lack of parks, gridlock on local roadways

13 particularly Grantland Avenue, Parkway Drive, and Herndon Avenue. The surrounding land
14 uses predominantly "sensitive receptors" such as single-family homes, schools, and churches
15 bear the burden of the additional emissions and environmental impacts caused by the
16 inadequate infrastructure.

17 24. On or about July 31, 2017, Real Parties in Interest filed Initial Study Application

18 No. 7359 seeking a development permit to construct 30,924 square foot animal shelter in six

19 different buildings on the site. Industrial development such as animal shelters, however, is
20 expressly prohibited by the Fresno County Ordinance Code on Rural Residential land. (Fresno

21 County Ordinance § 820.4.) Thus, the applicant filed General Plan Amendment No. 552 to

22 amend the lot's General Plan designation from "Rural Residential" to "Light Industrial" and
23 Amendment Application No. 3852 to change the zoning from R-R(nb) (Rural Residential,

24 Neighborhood Beautification Overlay) to M-1(c) (Light Manufacturing, Conditional) to allow

25 for an animal shelter by-right.

26 25. On or about June 8, 2018, County staff released the MND for the Project. The
27 County determined that although the Project was within close proximity to numerous residences
28 and other sensitive receptors, the Project would have no significant, unmitigated environmental

I {8232/002/00937020.DOCX} 7

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIER

1 impacts. The County made these findings despite the fact that the applicants had not proposed a
2 specific facility for the environmental review.

3 26. Public comments submitted by neighbors to Respondents highlighted deficiencies
4 in the MND. For instance, commenting parties noted the MND proposed to grant a by-right use
5 to build an animal shelter without proposing a specific facility, resulting in an incomplete
6 environmental analysis. The comments also noted the MND describes design features of the
7 Project to mitigate significant odor, noise, and traffic impacts without adequately discussing the
8 severity of the impact prior to mitigation and without making the mitigation measures as
9 binding. Comments also highlighted how the traffic report severely truncated its review by
10 focusing on a single intersection of traffic at Parkway Avenue and Grantland and did not
11 incorporate evidence of current conditions which already exceed the anticipated peak
12 congestion projected by the report.
13 27. On October 22, 2018, the Board held a hearing as to whether to approve the
14 application for the Project. Members of Forgotten Fresno, as well as the individually-named
15 Petitioners, raised numerous concerns about the inadequacy of the environmental review and
16 impact of the traffic, noise, odors, lights and other adverse impacts.
17 28. On October 23, 2018, despite the written and oral concerns about the Project, and
18 Respondents' failure to comply with their obligations under CEQA, the Board adopted the
19 MND and approved the Project.
20 CAUSES OF ACTION

21 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
22 Fair Argument of Significant Impacts in Violations of CEQA
23 29. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the precedent paragraphs 1 to
24 28 in their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

25 30. CEQA was adopted by the Legislature to prevent environmental harm while
26 providing a decent home and satisfying living for every Californian. The policies and
27 legislative intent behind CEQA are intended to be an integral party of any public agency's
28 ///

| {8232/002/00937020.DOCX} 8

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

decisionmaking process. CEQA applies to discretionary projects approved by public agencies,

2 including amending zoning ordinances and general plans.
31. The County was the lead agency under CEQA to evaluate the environmental

4 impacts of the Project under CEQA. As part of this duty, Respondents are required to

5 prepare an environmental impact report when substantial evidence in the record supports a

6 a fair argument that a project may have a significant impact on the environment.

7 32. CEQA also required Respondents to adopt feasible mitigation measures to

8 reduce or avoid any significant environmental impacts. If substantial evidence in the record

9 supports a fair argument that project's significant environmental impacts could not be
10 mitigated to a less than significant level, the County must prepare a full environmental
11 impact report instead of a mitigated negative declaration.

12 33. Respondents' approval of a development permit a constitutes a discretionary act
13 that triggers its obligation to comply with CEQA.
14 34. Respondents violated CEQA by approving the Project because, based on the
15 record, Respondents failed to adequately evaluate and mitigate the Project impacts that may
16 be significant, including, but not limited to:
17 35.. Impacts to Traffic. For the following reasons, the traffic study prepared for
18 the Project was deeply flawed, and a fair argument exists that the Project would result in
19 significant impacts to traffic and transportation:

20 a. The MND fails to adequately analyze and mitigate the traffic and

21 traffic safety impacts of the project. The traffic study, for instance,
22 included an artificially narrow scope that limited analysis to one
23 intersection - Parkway Drive/Grantland Avenue - notwithstanding
24 substantial credible evidence that the Project would result in

25 significant effects at other nearby congested intersections and

26 roadway segments.

27 b. The traffic study significantly understates the trip generation

28 estimations for the Project and are without basis in fact. More

II {8232/002/00937020.DOCX} 9
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 accurate figures show the Project would have significant
2 environmental effects.

3 C. The trip generation figures in the traffic study are erroneous
4 because they are based on a site plan that is erroneous, and subject
5 to change. More accurate trip generation figures reveal the Project
6 would have significant environmental effects.

7 d. The traffic study is erroneous because it is not based on real-world
8 conditions. As explained by Petitioners' traffic expert, the
9 conclusions in Respondents' traffic study are not consistent with on
10 the ground conditions, which reveal the surrounding intersections
11 operate less efficiently than the theoretical calculations presume. An
12 analysis of real-world conditions demonstrates the Project would have
13 significant environmental effects.

14 e. The traffic study offers erroneous information and evidence
15 concerning 2035 conditions, including the conclusion that the
16 Parkway/Grantland intersection will operate an acceptable levels of
17 service during p.m. peak hour conditions, which is inconsistent with
18 data from Caltrans and the City of Fresno in a recent environmental
19 document. When such information and evidence is taken into account,
20 it is plain the Project would result in potentially significant
21 environmental effects.

22 f. The Herndon/S.R. 99 Southbound offramp interchange is currently
23 operating at an unacceptable LOS (LOS E in a.m. peak hours and LOS
24 F in p.m. peak hours). The same is true for cumulative conditions.
25 Virtually all motorists making a left-hand turn onto Parkway Drive
26 will traverse this intersection. The Project will exacerbate these
27 unacceptable conditions under both existing conditions and 2035
28 conditions.

turn

4 Rather, to travel southbound, a vehicle would need to make a left-hand

on

un Parkway Drive, and travel through the residential

6 neighborhood to the west via Menlo, Annapolis, and Tenaya.

7 h. Photographs and videos of existing conditions show queuing for the

8 northbound/left movement extending past Tenaya Avenue, which is

O over 700 feet to the south, and blocks the Tenaya/Grantland
intersection.

10

11 i. Photographs and videos of existing conditions show queuing for the

12 northbound/right movement extending far past the 295 feet stated as
the queuing capacity in the traffic study.

13

14 j. Photographs and videos show motorists traveling northbound on

15 Grantland creating unsafe conditions by bypassing traffic on the dirt to

16 make a right-hand turning movement onto Parkway Drive/S.R. 99.

17 k. Photographs and videos show the Tenaya/Grantland Avenue

18 intersection operating at an unacceptable level of service during a.m.

19 peak hours. This is because motorists seeking to make a left-hand

20 turning movement from Tenaya Avenue onto Grantland are restricted

21 from making a left-hand turn movement onto Grantland due to
excessive queueing northbound on Grantland.

22 The Project will

23 exacerbate these unacceptable conditions because (i) vehicles seeking

24 to enter the Project from southbound Grantland will be required to

25 make a U-Turn at Tenaya Avenue, and (ii) vehicles seeking to travel

26 from the Project southbound on Grantland will be required to turn

27 north onto Grantland, and then route through the neighborhood, and

l. make a right-hand turn onto Grantland.

28 According to Central Unified School District, traffic conditions are
poor in the morning hours, and increases in traffic from the Project

I1 {8232/002/00937020.DOCX} 11
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- would exacerbate those unacceptable conditions.

2 To avoid traffic

3 safety issues resulting from the need for students to cross the street, the

4 County should require that the Project install traffic mitigation

5 measures in the form of controlled intersections for children to cross
Grantland Avenue and have a clear path of travel

6

7 36. Noise. A fair argument exists that the Project would result in significant impacts

8 to sensitive nearby receptors, and would result in noise levels in excess of the County Code.

9 Respondents' noise study is erroneous because it presumes the construction of the Project

10 would occur in a particular way, and does not address proximate nearby sensitive receptors.
37. Odors.

11 The IS/MND concedes the Project "has the potential to cause

12 objectionable odors from the use as an animal hospital and shelter," yet there is no binding

13 mitigation to avoid such potentially significant impacts. Rather, Respondents and the applicants
rely on

14 non-binding project features to suggest no significant impact would occur. As such, a

15 fair argument exists that the Project would result in significant environmental effects.
38. Aesthetics.

16 A fair argument exists that the Project would result in significant

17 aesthetic impacts. The County recognized the Project had the potential to create significant

18 impacts to aesthetics, and thus originally recommended that the Project incorporate a "six (6)

19 foot high solid masonry wall" along the property lines adjacent to Rural Residential Zone

20 Districts. The applicant, however, declined to incorporate this mitigation measure, leaving

21 recognized aesthetic impacts unmitigated. Because a mitigated negative declaration is only

22 appropriate where the applicant agreed to eliminate or avoid all potentially significant

23 environmental impacts by incorporating mitigation measures into the project, (see Pub.

24 Resources Code, §§ 21064.5, 21080, subd. (c)(2); CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15064(f)(2),
15070(b)), the adoption of the IS/MND was unlawful.
25 39.

26 Public Safety. A fair argument also exists that the Project could result in

27 public safety impacts associated with animals being unlawfully abandoned at the shelter.

28 Indeed, data from similar organizations suggests more than one animal per day is abandoned
unlawfully. Central Unified School District has also expressed concerns regarding this
I| {8232/002/00937020.DOCX) 12
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

issue, due to the proximity of the Project an Elementary School. Despite this, the impact

2 was left unmitigated. As such, a fair argument exists that the Project would have significant
3 impacts to public safety.

4 40. Land Use Impacts. CEQA requires agencies to evaluate whether a proposed

5 development project will, among other things, conflict with any land use plan, policy, or

6 regulation of an agency with jurisdiction over a project. A fair argument exists that the Project
7 as proposed will result in several conflicts with both the County's General Plan and the Zoning

8 Code. First, the Project seeks to bring an industrial land use into an area that is predominantly

9 rural residential. This conflicts with both sound land use principles, as industrial land uses are
10 typically incompatible with residential land uses, particularly when they are adjacent to each
11 other. In addition, as explained in Paragraphs 74 through 78 below, the Project is inconsistent
12 with several policies and programs articulated in the County's General Plan.
13 41. The County violated CEQA by failing to prepare an EIR for the Project when
14 the record demonstrates that the Project may cause the potentially significant environmental
15 impacts described above, among others, which have not been adequately disclosed,
16 analyzed, or mitigated to a less than significant level.
17 42. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion, and failed to proceed in a
18 manner required by law, by approving a mitigated negative declaration despite the presence
19 of a fair argument that the Project would have significant environmental effects. Thus,

20 Respondents abused their discretion by failing to prepare an environmental impact report to
21 address the significant environmental impacts.

22 43. Petitioners have a clear, present and beneficial right to performance by
23 Respondents of their duties under CEQA, and Respondents have the duty and capacity to
24 perform their duties under CEQA as the lead agency of the Project. Petitioners also have a
25 clear, present, and beneficial interest in the issuance of a writ of mandate as they are and will be
26 adversely affected by Respondents' violations of CEQA. The failure of Respondents to
27 perform their duties under the law requires this Court to issue a writ of mandate directing them

2 to discharge their duties under CEQA, pursuant to Sections 21080 and 21080.5 of the Public
Resources Code and Sections 1085 and 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

5 44. Failure to Analyze Cumulative Impacts Violates CEQA

6 Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the precedent paragraphs
43 in their entirety, as though fully set forth herein. to

7 45.

8 CEQA requires an agency to prepare an EIR for a project a whenever substantial

9 evidence in the record supports a fair argument that a project may have a significant impact on
the environment.

10 46.

11 CEQA requires a significant effect on the environment be found if the possible

12 effects of a project are individually limited, but cumulatively considerable. Cumulatively

13 considerable effects include past, current, and probable future projects. Failure to eliminate or

14 avoid all potentially significant environmental impacts can invalidate an MND.
47.

15 The County also violated CEQA when it approved the Industrial Project

16 before failing to adequate analyze the cumulative impacts of the Project. Together with the

17 impacts of other past, present and future projects, the impacts of the Project make an

18 incremental contribution and create a cumulatively considerable impact in violation of
CEQA and CEQA Guidelines section 15130(a):
19 a.

20 Traffic at Tenaya Avenue and North Grantland Avenue is already

21 operating at an unacceptable level, and the Project will exacerbate
these unacceptable conditions.
22

23 b. Only Herndon Avenue and Shaw Avenue provide access to the

24 Project site to Northwest Fresno, and several key intersections

25 within the vicinity of the Project are projected to operate an

26 unacceptable levels by 2035, including, but not limited to:

27 Northbound Highway 99 off-ramp at Herndon Avenue; Herndon

28 Avenue and North Parkway Drive; the intersection of North
Parkway Drive, North Grantland Avenue, and the onramp to

FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- Highway 99; and Herndon Avenue and Golden State Highway. The
2 Project will result in additional vehicle trips traversing each of the
6 7 4 0 above intersections, thus contributing to cumulatively considerable
conditions exacerbating the 2035 anticipated conditions.
c. While the MND calculates the Project's fair share contributions for
certain roadway improvements to Grantland Avenue over time,

7 there are no binding conditions to install any improvements or pay
the fair share of improvements, leaving the impacts to the above

9 intersections unmitigated.

10 48. Therefore, there is a fair argument the incremental contributions of the Project's
11 a traffic will result in a cumulatively considerable condition resulting in a significant impact.
12 49. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by taking the above-described
13 actions in violation of CEQA. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law,
14 and Respondents' decisions were not supported by substantial evidence in the record.

15 Respondents further violated CEQA by failing to independently review and analyze the effects

16 of their actions prior to approving and implementing those actions. The failure of Respondents

17 to perform their duties under the law requires this Court to issue a writ of mandate directing

18 them to discharge their duties under CEQA, pursuant to Sections 21080 and 21080.5 of the

19 Public Resources Code and Sections 1085 and 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

20 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

21 Piecemealing/Segmentation of Environmental Review in Violation of CEQA

22 50. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the precedent paragraphs 1 to

23 49 in their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

24 51. A project for CEQA purposes is "the whole of an action." An environmental

25 encompass and consider the whole of the project, rather than only pieces at a time, review must

26 prior to an agency approving or implementing any portion of the project or regulation.
27 52. Respondents impermissibly divided their consideration of the Project into several

28 separate reviews by failing to consider a specific site plan in the Initial Study or Mitigated

I {8232/002/00937020.DOCX} 15
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Negative Declaration. The County simply presumed that potential impacts of the Project would
2 be lessened or avoided through design features and project-specific actions, but did not in its
3 approval of the Project actually require that the Project be designed in any particular way. This
4 is of particular concern because any future site plan regardless of whether it incorporates the
5 project features discussed in the environmental document - could be considered a ministerial

6 approval outside the scope of CEQA.

53. By disaggregating the environmental review for the Project with the review of any
future site plan, Respondents have segmented environmental review in violation of CEQA.
9 The impacts of the site plan of the Project rely heavily on the design, location, construction, and
10 subsequent operation of the shelter facility. Full environmental review and consideration of the
11 Project must be considered before Respondents determine the applicants can build an animal
12 shelter by-right that also complies with CEQA.

13 54. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by taking the above-described
14 actions in violation of CEQA. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law,
15 and Respondents' decisions were not supported by substantial evidence in the record.
16 Respondents further violated CEQA by failing to independently review and analyze the effects
17 of their actions prior to approving and implementing those actions.

18 55. Petitioners also have a clear, present and beneficial interest in the issuance of a
19 writ of mandate by virtue of the facts set forth in this Petition, in that they are and will continue
20 to be adversely affected by Respondents' continuing violations of CEQA. The failure of
21 Respondents to perform their duties under the law requires this Court to issue a writ a of mandate
22 directing them to discharge their duties under CEQA, pursuant to Sections 21080 and 21080.5
23 of the Public Resources Code and Sections 1085 and 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
24 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

25 Inadequate and Incomplete Project Description
26 56. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the precedent paragraphs 1 to
27 55 in their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

1 57. To adequately and accurately assess the potential effects of any project, CEQA
2 requires that the lead agency prepare a project description that includes reasonably foreseeable
3 future activities that are consequences of the project. In addition, the entire project being
4 proposed (and not some smaller aspect of it), must be described in the environmental document.
5 The above requirements reflects the CEQA Guideline's definition of a "project" as the "whole

6 of an action." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15378.)
7 58. In this case, the Project considered by the County was simply a rezone and a
8 general plan amendment. The IS/MND, however, discussed a different project - i.e., a site plan
9 that was not before Respondents for consideration. Indeed, it appears the site plan will change
10 because the current design shows the parking lot in a public right of way. Moreover, the MND
11 does not describe the whole of the action, but rather a future hypothetical facility that has not
12 been specifically proposed or committed to.
13 59. By proceeding in this manner, Respondents failed to prepare a project description
14 that includes reasonably foreseeable future activities that are consequences of the project, an
15 also failed to describe the entire project being proposed.
16 60. Respondents therefore prejudicially abused their discretion by taking the above-
17 described actions in violation of CEQA. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required
18 by law, and Respondents' decisions were not supported by substantial evidence in the record.
19 Respondents further violated CEQA by failing to independently review and analyze the effects
20 of their actions prior to approving and implementing those actions. The failure of Respondents
21 to perform their duties under the law requires this Court to issue a writ of mandate directing
22 them to discharge their duties under CEQA, pursuant to Sections 21080 and 21080.5 of the
23 Public Resources Code and Sections 1085 and 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

62. CEQA requires a lead agency to first determine the full extent of a project's
2 impacts before it may apply mitigation measures to reduce those impacts. A lead agency may
not avoid analysis by simply presuming : design feature will be incorporated into the project to
4 lessen an environmental effect, without any binding commitment to ensure the design feature
will be implemented.

6 63. Following a full and adequate review of a project's potential environmental
effects, the lead agency must bind itself and/or the applicant to ensure mitigation will actually
occur through conditions of approval, contracts, or other methods. This requirement is intended
9 to ensure that mitigation measures will actually be implemented, not merely adopted and then
10 ignored.

11 64. In this case, the MND simply asserted the applicant would incorporate various
12 design features into the Project that were intended to prevent the occurrence of or minimize the
13 significance of adverse environmental effects. The MND then relied upon these alleged design
14 features to assert that the Project would not result in significant impacts as to, inter alia, odors,
15 aesthetics, noise, and traffic, without discussing the severity of the impact prior to mitigation,
16 and without incorporating the alleged design features as binding mitigation measures.
17 65. By proceeding in this fashion, Respondents impermissibly (i) side-stepped
18 analysis of the Project's potentially significant environmental effects, and (ii) failed to adopt
19 binding mitigation necessary to ensure those effects would not occur. This is impermissible
20 under CEQA. (Lotus v. Dept. of Trans. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 645, 651-52.)
21 66. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by taking the above-described
22 actions in violation of CEQA. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law,
23 and Respondents' decisions were not supported by substantial evidence in the record.
24 Respondents further violated CEQA by failing to independently review and analyze the effects
25 of their actions prior to approving and implementing those actions. Respondents' failure to
26 perform their duties under the law requires this Court to issue a writ of mandate directing them
27 to discharge their duties under CEQA, pursuant to Sections 21080 and 21080.5 of the Public
28 Resources Code and Sections 1085 and 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

4 Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the precedent paragraphs 1
66 in their entirety, as though fully set forth herein. to

5 68.

6 If, after circulation of an initial study, mitigation measures are changed, the initial

7 study should be recirculated for additional public review and opportunity to comment.
69.

8 Here, the initial study originally contemplated a mitigation measure in the form of
a six-foot high masonry wall to avoid or eliminate the aesthetic and noise

9 70. impacts of the project.

10 This mitigation measure was eliminated after the original circulation of the MND.

11 As conceded in the MND, the masonry wall was designed to avoid or lessen the Project's

12 environmental effects; in other words, the lack of a masonry wall would lead to adverse noise,

13 odor, and other substantial adverse impacts for the surrounding properties, residences, churches,
and school.

14 71.

15 Despite the removal of the mitigation measure, the County failed to recirculate the

16 MND for public review and comment before considering the Project for approval.
72.

17 Respondents therefore prejudicially abused their discretion by taking the above-

18 described actions in violation of CEQA. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required

19 by law, and Respondents' decisions were not supported by substantial evidence in the record.

20 Respondents further violated CEQA by failing to independently review and analyze the effects

21 of their actions prior to approving and implementing those actions. Respondents' failure to

22 perform their duties under the law requires this Court to issue a writ of mandate directing them

23 to discharge their duties under CEQA, pursuant to Sections 21080 and 21080.5 of the Public

SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

25

26 Inconsistency with the Fresno County General Plan
73.

27 Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the precedent paragraphs 1 to
72 in their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

28 ///

|I {8232/002/00937020.DOCX} 19
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 74. State planning and zoning law requires that all land-use decisions of counties
2 must be consistent with the county's General Plan. (Govt. Code, § 65860, subd. (a); see also
3 Corona-Norco Unif. Sch. Dist. V. City of Corona (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 985, 994.) A "project]
4 is consistent with the general plan if, considering all its aspects, it will further the objectives and
5 policies of the general plan and not obstruct their attainment." (Corona-Norco, supra, 17
6 Cal.App.4th at 994.)

7 75. "A project is inconsistent if it conflicts with a general plan policy that is
8 fundamental, mandatory, and clear." (Endangered Habitats League, Inc. V. County of Orange
9 (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 777, 782.)
10 76. Despite this requirement, the Project is inconsistent with numerous provisions of
11 the Fresno County General Plan, including:
12 a. Failure to identify, much less require, operational measures or
13 specialized equipment to protect public health, safety, and welfare and
14 to reduce adverse impacts of noise, odor, vibration, smoke, noxious
15 gases, heat and glare, dust and dirt, combustables, and other pollutants
16 on the property.
17 b. Failure to identify and require the Project applicants to maintain non-
18 objectionable use areas adjacent to or surrounding the shelter to isolate
19 adverse impacts from impacting the abutting church, commercial
20 properties, and residences.
21 C. Failure to identify, much less require, any project limits for the size,
22 time of operation, or length of permit for any function of the project.
23 d. Failure to identify any meaningful facility designs, traffic control
24 devices, or road upgrades to manage the industrial traffic going to or
25 coming from the Project.
26 e. Planning an industrial building in a rural residential neighborhood with a
27 already-overburdened infrastructure that is not well planned to

2 adequately serve or further the countywide economic development
goals related to the shelter.
3

4 f. Failing to minimize potential land use conflicts between the Project's

5 urban development and the existing rural-residential areas by

6 mandating buffers or graduated transitions between the Project and the
surrounding residences, church, and social hall.

7

8 g. Failing to protect residential and other noise-sensitive uses such as
churches and schools from
9 exposure to harmful or annoying noise

10 a levels or to develop a policy framework to achieve a healthful noise
environment.

11

12 h. Failing to require design elements necessary to fully minimize the

13 adverse noise impacts on the surrounding residences, churches, and
elementary school.
14 77.

15 Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by taking the above-described

16 actions in violation of CEQA and the County of Fresno General Plan. Respondents failed to

17 proceed in the manner required by law, and Respondents' decisions were not supported by

18 substantial evidence in the record. Respondents further violated CEQA by failing to

19 independently review and analyze the effects of their actions prior to approving and

20 implementing those actions. Pursuant to section 65000, et seq., of the Government Code,

21 Petitioners are entitled to petition this Court for a writ of mandate enjoining Respondents to
comply with State Planning and Zoning Law.
22 EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION

23 Declaratory Relief
24 78.

25 Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the precedent paragraphs 1 to 1
77 in their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

26 79.

27 With respect to the violations of law alleged in the First through Seventh Causes

28 of Action, there exists a clear and actual controversy between Petitioners and Respondents
regarding Respondents' failures to comply with CEQA, the Fresno County General Plan, and
{8232/002/00937020.DOCX) 21
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

the Fresno County Ordinance Code. Petitioners contend that Respondents have not complied

2 with CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, the Fresno County General Plan, and Fresno County
Ordinance Code, while Respondents contend that they have done so.

80. To remedy these violations of law, Petitioners request a declaration of the duties

5 of Respondents under CEQA, State Planning and Zoning Law, the Fresno County General Plan,

6 and Fresno County Ordinance Code, and a declaration that Respondents have not complied with

7 its duties under those provisions. Such declarations are a necessary and proper exercise of this

8 Court's power under section 1060 of the Code of Civil Procedure and under section 65000 of

9 the Government Code, to prevent violation of the Government Code, which requires that all
10 valid regulations shall be made "in accordance with standards prescribed by other provisions of
11 law."

12 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

13 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as follows:
14 1. For a peremptory writ of mandate pursuant to CEQA and the Code of Civil
15 Procedure section 1085 and Public Resources Code 21168.5, or, in the alternative, Code of Civil

16 Procedure section 1094.5 and Public Resources Code 21168.5, directing Respondents to vacate
17 and set aside their approval of the MND, General Plan Amendment, and Zoning Amendment

18 for the Project;

19 2. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents to comply with the
20 requirements of CEQA and take any other action required by the Public Resources Code
21 Section 21168.9, comply with the requirements of the County of Fresno General Plan, and

22 comply with the Fresno County Ordinance Code.

23 3. For declaratory relief under CEQA and the Code of Civil Procedure with respect
24 to the violations of law alleged in Petitioners' First through Fifth Causes of Action, as specified

25 in Petitioners' Sixth Cause of Action.

26 4. On Petitioners' First through Seventh Causes of Action, a temporary restraining a
27 order, preliminary injunction, and a permanent injunction, enjoining Respondents from

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

INTRODUCTION

2 1. Petitioners are representatives of the community west of State Route 99 between
3 the San Joaquin River and West Shields Avenue. Petitioners' community lies along the
4  jurisdictional boundary of the City of Fresno and the County of Fresno. Over the years,
development within Petitioners' community has outpaced critical infrastructure and services,
including adequate roadways, emergency services, and parks. Petitioners' community is
overburdened with severe traffic congestion and unsafe conditions on local roadways. For these
reasons, Petitioners refer to their community as "Forgotten Fresno."

9 2. This action challenges the October 23, 2018, decision of the Fresno County Board
10 of Supervisors (the "Board") to approve a Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND") for Initial
11 Study Application No. 7359, General Plan Amendment Application No. 552, and Amendment
12 Application No. 3852 for an animal shelter (the "Project"). The Project would place an
13 industrial land use in a residential neighborhood where development has far outpaced
14 infrastructure and resources necessary to support the existing community. This Verified
15 Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief ("Petition")
16 challenges the Board's reliance on an MND that is deeply flawed.
17 3. In its evaluation of the Project, Respondents, among other things, failed to ensure
18 the MND disclosed, analyzed, and mitigated the Project's many foreseeable public health and
19 environmental impacts as required by the California Environment Quality Act ("CEQA")
20 pursuant to Public Resources Code sections 21000 et seq., and the CEQA Guidelines, Title 14,
21 California Code of Regulations sections 15000 et seq.
22 4. The County also failed to ensure the industrial uses of the land were consistent
23 with the policies and objectives of the County's own General Plan.
24 5. Petitioners thus seek the following: (1) a writ of mandate pursuant to Sections
25 21080 and 21080.5 of the Public Resources Code and Sections 1085 and 1094.5 of the Code of
26 Civil Procedure setting aside certain decisions made by Respondents described below and to
27 enforce compliance with CEQA; (2) a writ of mandate pursuant due to Respondents' failure to
28 comply with State Planning and Zoning Law; (3) a declaratory judgment pursuant to Section
Il {8232/002/00937020.DOCX} 2
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1060 of the Code of Civil Procedure; and (4) injunctive relief pursuant to Sections 525-526 of

2 the Code of Civil Procedure to obtain compliance with CEQA and Section 65000, et seq., of the

3 Government Code.

4 PARTIES, JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5 6. Petitioner and Plaintiff Forgotten Fresno is a California Nonprofit Public Benefit

6 Corporation based in Fresno, California. Forgotten Fresno is dedicated to improving the

7 infrastructure and well-being of Northwest Fresno and Northwest Fresno County

8 I neighborhoods. Several members of Forgotten Fresno reside in the arca affected by the

9 proposed Project's environmental impacts. Although Forgotten Fresno was not organized at the
10 time of the administrative proceedings for the proposed Project, several of its members made

11 objections in writing or orally prior to the close of the public hearing evaluating the project held
12 by the County of Fresno on October 23, 2018. The maintenance and prosecution of this action
13 will confer a substantial benefit on the public by protecting the public from the environmental

14 and other harms alleged herein and by ensuring that the County abides by the procedures
15 required under law in approving development projects like the one at issue here. Forgotten
16 Fresno is beneficially interested in this matter because it has a direct interest in ensuring that the
17 Respondents fulfill their duties to comply with CEQA, State law, and the County's own

18 ordinance code. Forgotten Fresno has an interest in preserving and protecting, for the general
19 public, the environment and character of Northwest Fresno.

20 7. Petitioner and Plaintiff Gonzalo Arias, Jr., is a resident of Northwest Fresno who

21 lives within the neighborhood directly west of the site proposed for the Project and relies on the
22 same roads, intersections, and other infrastructure supporting the proposed Project. As such,

23 Petitioner Arias is beneficially interested in the Project's impact on roads, infrastructure, and the
24 surrounding community. Petitioner Arias participated in the administrative process leading up

25 to the Board's approval of the proposed Project by making oral objections at the Project hearing
26 before the Fresno County Board of Supervisors on October 23, 2018.

27 8. Petitioner and Plaintiff Roger Day is a resident of Northwest Fresno who lives
28 within the neighborhood directly west of the site proposed for the Project and relies on the same

Il {8232/002/00937020.DOCX} 3

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

roads, intersections, and other infrastructure supporting the proposed Project. As such,

2 Petitioner Day is beneficially interested in the Project's future environmental impact on roads,

3 infrastructure, and the surrounding community. Petitioner Day participated in the

4 administrative process leading up to the Board's approval of the proposed Project by making

5 oral objections at the Project hearing before the Fresno County Board of Supervisors on October

6 23, 2018.

7 9. Petitioner and Plaintiff Elisa Bilios is a resident of Northwest Fresno who lives

8 within the neighborhood directly west of the site proposed for the Project and relies on the same

9 roads, intersections, and other infrastructure supporting the proposed Project. As such,
10 Petitioner Bilios is beneficially interested in the Project's future environmental impact on roads,
11 infrastructure, and the surrounding community. Petitioner Bilios participated in the
12 administrative process leading up to the Board's approval of the proposed Project by making
13 oral objections at the Project hearing before the Fresno County Board of Supervisors on October
14 23, 2018.

15 10. Respondent the County of Fresno is a charter county in the State of California
16 responsible for administering and carrying out its laws and applicable state laws. The County is
17 the "lead agency" for conducting the environmental review of the proposed Project for the
18 purposes of Public Resources Code section 21067. The County must comply with CEQA, state
19 law, and its own ordinances.

20 11. Respondent Fresno County Board of Supervisors is, and at all times herein

21 mentioned was, the duly elected decision-making body of Respondent Fresno County. As the
22 decision making body, the Board was charged with responsibilities under CEQA for conducting
23 a proper review of the proposed action's environmental impacts and granting the various

24 approvals necessary for the project.
25 12. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that Real Party in

26 Interest Wesclo, L.P. is, and at all times herein mentioned was, the land owner of the lot
27 property where the proposed Project is to be located.
28 ///

13. Petitioners are also informed and believe, and thereon allege, that Real Party in

2 Interest Fresno Humane Animal Services is, and at all times herein mentioned was, the

3 applicant for the approvals granted by the County for the proposed shelter.

4 14. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents

5 fictitiously named Does through 20 and sues such respondents by fictitious names.

6 Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that the fictitiously named

7 respondents are also responsible for the actions described in this Petition. When the true

g identities and capacities of these Respondents have been determined, Petitioners will amend

9 this petition, with leave of the court if necessary, to insert such identities and capacities.

10 15. Petitioners and/or their members have performed any and all conditions precedent
11 to the filing of this Petition. Petitioners Arias, Brooks, Day, and Bilios exhausted any and all
12 administrative remedies required by law by, inter alia, participating in the administrative and

13 environmental review process both in writing and orally at the October 23, 2018 hearing before
14 the Fresno County Board of Supervisors. Although Petitioner Forgotten Fresno was formed
15 after the administrative proceedings concluded, several members of Forgotten Fresno timely
16 objected and exhausted any and all administrative remedies required by law by, inter alia,
17 participating in the administrative review process in writing or orally at the October 23, 2018
18 hearing before the Board. This participation is acknowledged in Petitioner's October 22, 2018,
19 letter from Petitioners to the Clerk to the Board of Supervisors of Fresno County and the Senior
20 Planner of the Development Services and Capital Projects Division in the Fresno County

21 Department of Public Works and Planning, regarding the Respondents' determination of the

22 Project application.

23 16. Petitioners complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code § 21167.5

24 by mailing written notice of this action to Respondents. A copy of the letter providing written
25 notice to Respondents, and proofs of service of the letter, are attached hereto as Exhibit "A."

26 17. A copy of this Petition will be served on the Attorney General concurrently with
27 the filing of this Petition pursuant to Section 388 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

2 Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code 8 21167.6 by filing a

3 request concerning the preparation of the record of administrative proceedings relating to this

4 action concurrently with this Petition, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit "B."

19. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary

6 law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside

7 their adoption of the MND and approvals for the Project. In the absence of such remedies,

8 Respondents' approvals will remain in effect in violation of state law, and the environment,

9 Petitioners and other residents within the vicinity of the Project will be irreparably harmed. No

10 money damages or legal remedy could adequately compensate Petitioners and those residents
and property owners for that harm.
11 20.

12 Sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code and sections 1085 and

13 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure provide for review in this Court of actions by state

14 agencies and officers to determine whether those actions comply with CEQA. Sections 525-526

15 of the Code of Civil Procedure provide for an injunction when it appears that Petitioners are

16 entitled to the relief sought, and section 1060 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides for a

17 judicial declaration of Petitioners' rights and Respondents' duties. Accordingly, and based on

18 the facts stated in this Petition, this Court has jurisdiction to grant declaratory and injunctive
relief and to issue a writ of mandate on the claims presented here.

19 21.

20 Venue in Fresno County Superior Court is proper pursuant to section 394 of the

21 Code of Civil Procedure. The County and the Board that approved the Project are located

22 within the County of Fresno, and the Project at issue is located within the jurisdictional
boundaries of the County of Fresno.

23 STATEMENT OF FACTS

24 22.

25 The Project site is located in a rural residential neighborhood west of Highway 99

26 where Fresno County borders the Northwest corner of Fresno City. The site for the proposed

27 Project is an undeveloped 4.14 acre lot in a Rural Residential ("R-R") zoned District "intended

28 to create or preserve rural or very large lot residential homesites where a limited range of
agricultural activities may be conducted." (Fresno County Ord. § 820.) Prior to the October 23,

{8232/002/00937020.DOCX} 6

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

2018, hearing, the lot had a land use designation of Rural-Residential under the County's

2 General Plan, and was zoned Rural-Residential since 1976. The property is bordered by North
3 Grantland Avenue to the West, State Route 99 to the East, churches to the north, and the Dante

4 Club of Fresno and a residential home to the South. The immediate area surrounding the

5 property consists of R-R zoned single-family residences, churches, a social venue, and the
6 Herndon-Barstow elementary school.

7 23. Rapid development of Northwest Fresno west of Highway 99 over the last decade

8 has significantly outpaced the development of local infrastructure. Access between the

9 proposed Project and northwest Fresno is either Herndon Avenue to the north or Shaw Avenue
10 to the south. Due to the varied nature of the Fresno County and Fresno City agencies with
11 jurisdiction over land use and roadway in the proposed site area, local infrastructure has been
12 developed in a manner that is haphazard, resulting in a lack of parks, gridlock on local roadways
13 particularly Grantland Avenue, Parkway Drive, and Herndon Avenue. The surrounding land
14 uses - predominantly "sensitive receptors" such as single-family homes, schools, and churches
15 bear the burden of the additional emissions and environmental impacts caused by the
16 inadequate infrastructure.

17 24. On or about July 31, 2017, Real Parties in Interest filed Initial Study Application
18 No. 7359 seeking a development permit to construct 30,924 square foot animal shelter in six
19 different buildings on the site. Industrial development such as animal shelters, however, is
20 expressly prohibited by the Fresno County Ordinance Code on Rural Residential land. (Fresno
21 County Ordinance § 820.4.) Thus, the applicant filed General Plan Amendment No. 552 to
22 amend the lot's General Plan designation from "Rural Residential" to "Light Industrial" and
23 Amendment Application No. 3852 to change the zoning from R-R(nb) (Rural Residential,

24 Neighborhood Beautification Overlay) to M-1(c) (Light Manufacturing, Conditional) to allow
25 for an animal shelter by-right.

26 25. On or about June 8, 2018, County staff released the MND for the Project. The
27 County determined that although the Project was within close proximity to numerous residences

28 and other sensitive receptors, the Project would have no significant, unmitigated environmental

|| {8232/002/00937020.DOCX} 7

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

impacts. The County made these findings despite the fact that the applicants had not proposed a
2 specific facility for the environmental review.

3 26. Public comments submitted by neighbors to Respondents highlighted deficiencies

4 in the MND. For instance, commenting parties noted the MND proposed to grant a by-right use

5 to build an animal shelter without proposing a specific facility, resulting in an incomplete
6 environmental analysis. The comments also noted the MND describes design features of the
7 Project to mitigate significant odor, noise, and traffic impacts without adequately discussing the
8 severity of the impact prior to mitigation and without making the mitigation measures as

9 binding. Comments also highlighted how the traffic report severely truncated its review by
10 focusing on a single intersection of traffic at Parkway Avenue and Grantland and did not
11 incorporate evidence of current conditions which already exceed the anticipated peak
12 congestion projected by the report.
13 27. On October 22, 2018, the Board held a hearing as to whether to approve the
14 application for the Project. Members of Forgotten Fresno, as well as the individually-named
15 Petitioners, raised numerous concerns about the inadequacy of the environmental review and
16 impact of the traffic, noise, odors, lights and other adverse impacts.
17 28. On October 23, 2018, despite the written and oral concerns about the Project, and]
18 Respondents' failure to comply with their obligations under CEQA, the Board adopted the
19 MND and approved the Project.
20 CAUSES OF ACTION
21 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
22 Fair Argument of Significant Impacts in Violations of CEQA
23 29. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the precedent paragraphs 1 to
24 28 in their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
25 30. CEQA was adopted by the Legislature to prevent environmental harm while
26 providing a decent home and satisfying living for every Californian. The policies and
27 legislative intent behind CEQA are intended to be an integral party of any public agency's
28 ///

{8232/002/00937020.DOCX} 8
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

decisionmaking process. CEQA applies to discretionary projects approved by public agencies,

2 including amending zoning ordinances and general plans.

3 31. The County was the lead agency under CEQA to evaluate the environmental

4 impacts of the Project under CEQA. As part of this duty, Respondents are required to

5 prepare an environmental impact report when substantial evidence in the record supports a

6 fair argument that a project may have a significant impact on the environment.

7 32. CEQA also required Respondents to adopt feasible mitigation measures to

8 reduce or avoid any significant environmental impacts. If substantial evidence in the record

9 supports a fair argument that project's significant environmental impacts could not be
10 mitigated to a less than significant level, the County must prepare a full environmental
11 impact report instead of a mitigated negative declaration.
12 33. Respondents' approval of a development permit constitutes a discretionary act
13 that triggers its obligation to comply with CEQA.
14 34. Respondents violated CEQA by approving the Project because, based on the
15 record, Respondents failed to adequately evaluate and mitigate the Project impacts that may
16 be significant, including, but not limited to:
17 35. Impacts to Traffic. For the following reasons, the traffic study prepared for
18 the Project was deeply flawed, and a fair argument exists that the Project would result in
19 significant impacts to traffic and transportation:
20 a. The MND fails to adequately analyze and mitigate the traffic and
21 traffic safety impacts of the project. The traffic study, for instance,
22 included an artificially narrow scope that limited analysis to one

23 intersection - Parkway Drive/Grantland Avenue - notwithstanding

24 substantial credible evidence that the Project would result in

25 significant effects at other nearby congested intersections and

26 roadway segments.

27 b. The traffic study significantly understates the trip generation

28 estimations for the Project and are without basis in fact. More

Il (8232/002/00937020.DOCX} 9
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

-

2 accurate figures show the Project would have significant
environmental effects.

3 C.

4 The trip generation figures in the traffic study are erroneous
because they are based on a site plan that is erroneous, and subject

6 to change. More accurate trip generation figures reveal the Project
would have significant environmental effects.

7 d. The traffic study is erroneous because it is not based on real-world
conditions.

9 As explained by Petitioners' traffic expert, the

10 conclusions in Respondents' traffic study are not consistent with on

11 the ground conditions, which reveal the surrounding intersections

12 operate less efficiently than the theoretical calculations presume. An

13 analysis of real-world conditions demonstrates the Project would have
significant environmental effects.

14

15 e. The traffic study offers erroncous information and evidence

16 concerning 2035 conditions, including the conclusion that the

17 Parkway/Grantland intersection will operate an acceptable levels of

18 service during p.m. peak hour conditions, which is inconsistent with

19 data from Caltrans and the City of Fresno in a recent environmental

20 document. When such information and evidence is taken into account,

21 it is plain the Project would result in potentially significant
environmental effects.

22

23 f. The Herndon/S.R. 99 Southbound offramp interchange is currently

24 operating at an unacceptable LOS (LOS E in a.m. peak hours and LOS

25 F in p.m. peak hours). The same is true for cumulative conditions.

26 Virtually all motorists making a left-hand turn onto Parkway Drive

27 will traverse this intersection. The Project will exacerbate these

28 unacceptable conditions under both existing conditions and 2035
conditions.

FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

h

2 g. There is no direct way to travel southbound from the Project site.

3 Rather, to travel southbound, a vehicle would need to make a left-hand
turn on

4 Parkway Drive, and travel through the residential

5 neighborhood to the west via Menlo, Annapolis, and Tenaya.

6 h. Photographs and videos of existing conditions show queuing for the

7 northbound/left movement extending past Tenaya Avenue, which is

8 over 700 feet to the south, and blocks the Tenaya/Grantland
intersection.

9

10 i. Photographs and videos of existing conditions show queuing for the

11 northbound/right movement extending far past the 295 feet stated as
the queuing capacity in the traffic study.
12

13 j. Photographs and videos show motorists traveling northbound on

14 Grantland creating unsafe conditions by bypassing traffic on the dirt to

15 make a right-hand turning movement onto Parkway Drive/S.R. 99.

16 k. Photographs and videos show the Tenaya/Grantland Avenue

17 intersection operating at an unacceptable level of service during a.m.

18 peak hours. This is because motorists seeking to make a left-hand

19 turning movement from Tenaya Avenue onto Grantland are restricted

20 from making a left-hand turn movement onto Grantland due to
excessive queueing northbound on Grantland.
21 The Project will

22 exacerbate these unacceptable conditions because (i) vehicles seeking

23 to enter the Project from southbound Grantland will be required to

24 make a U-Turn at Tenaya Avenue, and (ii) vehicles seeking to travel

25 from the Project southbound on Grantland will be required to turn

26 north onto Grantland, and then route through the neighborhood, and
make a right-hand turn onto Grantland.

27 1.

28 According to Central Unified School District, traffic conditions are
poor in the morning hours, and increases in traffic from the Project
{8232/002/00937020.DOCX} 11
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

would exacerbate those unacceptable conditions. To avoid traffic

2 safety issues resulting from the need for students to cross the street, the

3 County should require that the Project install traffic mitigation

4 measures in the form of controlled intersections for children to cross

5 Grantland Avenue and have a clear path of travel

6 36. Noise. A fair argument exists that the Project would result in significant impacts

7 to sensitive nearby receptors, and would result in noise levels in excess of the County Code.

8 Respondents' noise study is erroneous because it presumes the construction of the Project

9 would occur in a particular way, and does not address proximate nearby sensitive receptors.

10 37. Odors. The IS/MND concedes the Project "has the potential to cause

11 objectionable odors from the use as an animal hospital and shelter," yet there is no binding

12 mitigation to avoid such potentially significant impacts. Rather, Respondents and the applicants
13 rely on non-binding project features to suggest no significant impact would occur. As such, a

14 fair argument exists that the Project would result in significant environmental effects.
15 38. Aesthetics. A fair argument exists that the Project would result in significant
16 aesthetic impacts. The County recognized the Project had the potential to create significant

17 impacts to aesthetics, and thus originally recommended that the Project incorporate a "six (6)
18 foot high solid masonry wall" along the property lines adjacent to Rural Residential Zone

19 Districts. The applicant, however, declined to incorporate this mitigation measure, leaving

20 recognized aesthetic impacts unmitigated. Because a mitigated negative declaration is only

21 appropriate where the applicant agreed to eliminate or avoid all potentially significant

22 environmental impacts by incorporating mitigation measures into the project, (see Pub.
23 Resources Code, §§ 21064.5, 21080, subd. (c)(2); CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15064(f)(2),

24 15070(b)), the adoption of the IS/MND was unlawful.

25 39. Public Safety. A fair argument also exists that the Project could result in

26 public safety impacts associated with animals being unlawfully abandoned at the shelter.
27 Indeed, data from similar organizations suggests more than one animal per day is abandoned
28 unlawfully. Central Unified School District has also expressed concerns regarding this

/ {8232/002/00937020.DOCX} 12
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

issue, due to the proximity of the Project an Elementary School. Despite this, the impact

2 was left unmitigated. As such, a fair argument exists that the Project would have significant

3 impacts to public safety.

4 40. Land Use Impacts. CEQA requires agencies to evaluate whether a proposed

5 development project will, among other things, conflict with any land use plan, policy, or

6 regulation of an agency with jurisdiction over a project. A fair argument exists that the Project

7 as proposed will result in several conflicts with both the County's General Plan and the Zoning

8 Code. First, the Project seeks to bring an industrial land use into an area that is predominantly

9 rural residential. This conflicts with both sound land use principles, as industrial land uses are
10 typically incompatible with residential land uses, particularly when they are adjacent to each
11 other. In addition, as explained in Paragraphs 74 through 78 below, the Project is inconsistent
12 with several policies and programs articulated in the County's General Plan.
13 41. The County violated CEQA by failing to prepare an EIR for the Project when
14 the record demonstrates that the Project may cause the potentially significant environmental
15 impacts described above, among others, which have not been adequately disclosed,
16 analyzed, or mitigated to a less than significant level.
17 42. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion, and failed to proceed in a

18 manner required by law, by approving a mitigated negative declaration despite the presence
19 of a fair argument that the Project would have significant environmental effects. Thus,

20 Respondents abused their discretion by failing to prepare an environmental impact report to
21 address the significant environmental impacts.

22 43. Petitioners have a clear, present and beneficial right to performance by
23 Respondents of their duties under CEQA, and Respondents have the duty and capacity to

24 perform their duties under CEQA as the lead agency of the Project. Petitioners also have a

25 clear, present, and beneficial interest in the issuance of a writ of mandate as they are and will be

26 adversely affected by Respondents' violations of CEQA. The failure of Respondents to
27 perform their duties under the law requires this Court to issue a writ of mandate directing them

28 ///

{8232/002/00937020.DOCX} 13
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

to discharge their duties under CEQA, pursuant to Sections 21080 and 21080.5 of the Public
2 Resources Code and Sections 1085 and 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

4 Failure to Analyze Cumulative Impacts Violates CEQA

5 44. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the precedent paragraphs 1 to

6 43 in their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

7 45. CEQA requires an agency to prepare an EIR for a project whenever substantial

8 evidence in the record supports a fair argument that a project may have a significant a impact on

9 the environment.

10 46. CEQA requires a significant effect on the environment be found if the possible
11 effects of a project are individually limited, but cumulatively considerable. Cumulatively
12 considerable effects include past, current, and probable future projects. Failure to eliminate or
13 avoid all potentially significant environmental impacts can invalidate an MND.
14 47. The County also violated CEQA when it approved the Industrial Project
15 before failing to adequate analyze the cumulative impacts of the Project. Together with the

16 impacts of other past, present and future projects, the impacts of the Project make an
17 incremental contribution and create a cumulatively considerable impact in violation of
18 CEQA and CEQA Guidelines section 15130(a):
19 a. Traffic at Tenaya Avenue and North Grantland Avenue is already

20 operating at an unacceptable level, and the Project will exacerbate

21 these unacceptable conditions.

22 b. Only Herndon Avenue and Shaw Avenue provide access to the

23 Project site to Northwest Fresno, and several key intersections
24 within the vicinity of the Project are projected to operate an
25 unacceptable levels by 2035, including, but not limited to:

26 Northbound Highway 99 off-ramp at Herndon Avenue; Herndon
27 Avenue and North Parkway Drive; the intersection of North
28 Parkway Drive, North Grantland Avenue, and the onramp to

II {8232/002/00937020.DOCX} 14
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

2 Highway 99; and Herndon Avenue and Golden State Highway. The
Project will result in additional vehicle trips traversing each of the
above intersections, thus contributing to cumulatively considerable

un conditions exacerbating the 2035 anticipated conditions.

C.

6 While the MND calculates the Project's fair share contributions for

7 certain roadway improvements to Grantland Avenue over time,

8 there are no binding conditions to install any improvements or pay

9 the fair share of improvements, leaving the impacts to the above
intersections unmitigated.

10

11 48. Therefore, there is a fair argument the incremental contributions of the Project's

12 a traffic will result in a cumulatively considerable condition resulting in a significant impact.

49.

13 Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by taking the above-described

14 actions in violation of CEQA. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law,

15 and Respondents' decisions were not supported by substantial evidence in the record.

16 Respondents further violated CEQA by failing to independently review and analyze the effects

17 of their actions prior to approving and implementing those actions. The failure of Respondents

18 to perform their duties under the law requires this Court to issue a writ of mandate directing

19 them to discharge their duties under CEQA, pursuant to Sections 21080 and 21080.5 of the

20 Public Resources Code and Sections 1085 and 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

21

22 Piecemealing/Segmentation of Environmental Review in Violation of CEQA

50.

23 Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the precedent paragraphs 1 to
49 in their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

24 51.

25 A project for CEQA purposes is "the whole of an action.3 An environmental

26 review must encompass and consider the whole of the project, rather than only pieces at a time,

27 prior to an agency approving or implementing any portion of the project or regulation.

28 Respondents impermissibly divided their consideration of the Project into several
separate reviews by failing to consider a specific site plan in the Initial Study or Mitigated

II {8232/002/00937020.DOCX} 15
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Negative Declaration. The County simply presumed that potential impacts of the Project would

2 be lessened or avoided through design features and project-specific actions, but did not in its
approval of the Project actually require that the Project be designed in any particular way. This

4 is of particular concern because any future site plan - regardless of whether it incorporates the

5 project features discussed in the environmental document - could be considered a ministerial

6 approval outside the scope of CEQA.

7 53. By disaggregating the environmental review for the Project with the review of any

8 future site plan, Respondents have segmented environmental review in violation of CEQA.

9 The impacts of the site plan of the Project rely heavily on the design, location, construction, and

10 subsequent operation of the shelter facility. Full environmental review and consideration of the

11 Project must be considered before Respondents determine the applicants can build an animal

12 shelter by-right that also complies with CEQA.
13 54. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by taking the above-described
14 actions in violation of CEQA. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law,
15 and Respondents' decisions were not supported by substantial evidence in the record.

16 Respondents further violated CEQA by failing to independently review and analyze the effects
17 of their actions prior to approving and implementing those actions.

18 55. Petitioners also have a clear, present and beneficial interest in the issuance of a

19 writ of mandate by virtue of the facts set forth in this Petition, in that they are and will continue

20 to be adversely affected by Respondents' continuing violations of CEQA. The failure of

21 Respondents to perform their duties under the law requires this Court to issue a writ of mandate

22 directing them to discharge their duties under CEQA, pursuant to Sections 21080 and 21080.5

23 of the Public Resources Code and Sections 1085 and 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

24 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

25 Inadequate and Incomplete Project Description

26 56. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the precedent paragraphs 1 to

27 55 in their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

57. To adequately and accurately assess the potential effects of any project, CEQA
2 requires that the lead agency prepare a project description that includes reasonably foreseeable
3 future activities that are consequences of the project. In addition, the entire project being
4 proposed (and not some smaller aspect of it), must be described in the environmental document.
5 The above requirements reflects the CEQA Guideline's definition of a "project" as the "whole
6 of an action." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15378.)

7 58. In this case, the Project considered by the County was simply a rezone and a
8 general plan amendment. The IS/MND, however, discussed a different project - i.e., a site plan
9 that was not before Respondents for consideration. Indeed, it appears the site plan will change
10 because the current design shows the parking lot in a public right of way. Moreover, the MND
11 does not describe the whole of the action, but rather a future hypothetical facility that has not
12 been specifically proposed or committed to.

13 59. By proceeding in this manner, Respondents failed to prepare a project description
14 that includes reasonably foresecable future activities that are consequences of the project, an
15 also failed to describe the entire project being proposed.
16 60. Respondents therefore prejudicially abused their discretion by taking the above-
17 described actions in violation of CEQA. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required
18 by law, and Respondents' decisions were not supported by substantial evidence in the record.
19 Respondents further violated CEQA by failing to independently review and analyze the effects
20 of their actions prior to approving and implementing those actions. The failure of Respondents
21 to perform their duties under the law requires this Court to issue a writ of mandate directing
22 them to discharge their duties under CEQA, pursuant to Sections 21080 and 21080.5 of the
23 Public Resources Code and Sections 1085 and 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

25 Failure to Analyze/Mitigate Significant Environmental Effects

62. CEQA requires a lead agency to first determine the full extent of a project's
2 impacts before it may apply mitigation measures to reduce those impacts. A lead agency may
not avoid analysis by simply presuming a design feature will be incorporated into the project to
4 lessen an environmental effect, without any binding commitment to ensure the design feature
5 will be implemented.

6 63. Following a full and adequate review of a project's potential environmental
7 effects, the lead agency must bind itself and/or the applicant to ensure mitigation will actually

8 occur through conditions of approval, contracts, or other methods. This requirement is intended
9 to ensure that mitigation measures will actually be implemented, not merely adopted and then
10 ignored.

11 64. In this case, the MND simply asserted the applicant would incorporate various
12 design features into the Project that were intended to prevent the occurrence of or minimize the
13 significance of adverse environmental effects. The MND then relied upon these alleged design
14 features to assert that the Project would not result in significant impacts as to, inter alia, odors,
15 aesthetics, noise, and traffic, without discussing the severity of the impact prior to mitigation,
16 and without incorporating the alleged design features as binding mitigation measures.
17 65. By proceeding in this fashion, Respondents impermissibly (i) side-stepped
18 analysis of the Project's potentially significant environmental effects, and (ii) failed to adopt
19 binding mitigation necessary to ensure those effects would not occur. This is impermissible
20 under CEQA. (Lotus v. Dept. of Trans. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 645, 651-52.)
21 66. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by taking the above-described
22 actions in violation of CEQA. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law,
23 and Respondents' decisions were not supported by substantial evidence in the record.
24 Respondents further violated CEQA by failing to independently review and analyze the effects
25 of their actions prior to approving and implementing those actions. Respondents' failure to
26 perform their duties under the law requires this Court to issue a writ of mandate directing them
27 to discharge their duties under CEQA, pursuant to Sections 21080 and 21080.5 of the Public

28 Resources Code and Sections 1085 and 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

3 Failure to Recirculate MND in Violation of CEQA

67.

4 Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the precedent paragraphs 1 to
66 in their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

5 68.

6 If, after circulation of an initial study, mitigation measures are changed, the initial

7 study should be recirculated for additional public review and opportunity to comment.
69.

8 Here, the initial study originally contemplated a mitigation measure in the form of

9 a six-foot high masonry wall to avoid or eliminate the aesthetic and noise impacts of the project.
70.

10 This mitigation measure was eliminated after the original circulation of the MND.

11 As conceded in the MND, the masonry wall was designed to avoid or lessen the Project's

12 environmental effects; in other words, the lack of a masonry wall would lead to adverse noise,

13 odor, and other substantial adverse impacts for the surrounding properties, residences, churches,
and school.

14 71.

15 Despite the removal of the mitigation measure, the County failed to recirculate the

16 MND for public review and comment before considering the Project for approval.
72.

17 Respondents therefore prejudicially abused their discretion by taking the above-

18 described actions in violation of CEQA. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required

19 by law, and Respondents' decisions were not supported by substantial evidence in the record.

20 Respondents further violated CEQA by failing to independently review and analyze the effects

21 of their actions prior to approving and implementing those actions. Respondents' failure to

22 perform their duties under the law requires this Court to issue a writ of mandate directing them

23 to discharge their duties under CEQA, pursuant to Sections 21080 and 21080.5 of the Public

24 Resources Code and Sections 1085 and 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

25

26 Inconsistency with the Fresno County General Plan

73.

27 Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the precedent paragraphs 1 to
72 in their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

28 ///

I {8232/002/00937020.DOCX} 19
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

l 74. State planning and zoning law requires that all land-use decisions of counties
2 must be consistent with the county's General Plan. (Govt. Code, § 65860, subd. (a); see also §
3 Corona-Norco Unif. Sch. Dist. V. City of Corona (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 985, 994.) A "project

4 is consistent with the general plan if, considering all its aspects, it will further the objectives and
5 policies of the general plan and not obstruct their attainment." (Corona-Norco, supra, 17
6 Cal.App.4th at 994.)

7 75. "A project is inconsistent if it conflicts with a general plan policy that is
8 fundamental, mandatory, and clear." (Endangered Habitats League, Inc. V. County of Orange
(2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 777, 782.)
10 76. Despite this requirement, the Project is inconsistent with numerous provisions of
11 the Fresno County General Plan, including:

12 a. Failure to identify, much less require, operational measures or
13 specialized equipment to protect public health, safety, and welfare and
14 to reduce adverse impacts of noise, odor, vibration, smoke, noxious
15 gases, heat and glare, dust and dirt, combustables, and other pollutants
16 on the property.
17 b. Failure to identify and require the Project applicants to maintain non-
18 objectionable use areas adjacent to or surrounding the shelter to isolate
19 adverse impacts from impacting the abutting church, commercial
20 properties, and residences.
21 c. Failure to identify, much less require, any project limits for the size,
22 time of operation, or length of permit for any function of the project.
23 d. Failure to identify any meaningful facility designs, traffic control
24 devices, or road upgrades to manage the industrial traffic going to or
25 coming from the Project.
26 e. Planning an industrial building in a rural residential neighborhood with
27 already-overburdened infrastructure that is not well planned to

-

2 adequately serve or further the countywide economic development

D:W goals related to the shelter.

f. Failing to minimize potential land use conflicts between the Project's
urban development and the existing rural-residential areas by
mandating buffers or graduated transitions between the Project and the

7 surrounding residences, church, and social hall.

8 g. Failing to protect residential and other noise-sensitive uses such as
churches and schools from exposure to harmful or annoying noise

10 a levels or to develop a policy framework to achieve a healthful noise

11 environment.

12 h. Failing to require design elements necessary to fully minimize the

13 adverse noise impacts on the surrounding residences, churches, and

14 elementary school.

77.

15 Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by taking the above-described

16 actions in violation of CEQA and the County of Fresno General Plan. Respondents failed to

17 proceed in the manner required by law, and Respondents' decisions were not supported by

18 substantial evidence in the record. Respondents further violated CEQA by failing to

19 independently review and analyze the effects of their actions prior to approving and

20 implementing those actions. Pursuant to section 65000, et seq., of the Government Code,

21 Petitioners are entitled to petition this Court for a writ of mandate enjoining Respondents to

22 comply with State Planning and Zoning Law.

23 EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION

24 78. Declaratory Relief

25 Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the precedent paragraphs 1 to

26 77 in their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

79.

27 With respect to the violations of law alleged in the First through Seventh Causes

28 of Action, there exists a clear and actual controversy between Petitioners and Respondents
regarding Respondents' failures to comply with CEQA, the Fresno County General Plan, and

{8232/002/00937020.DOCX} 21
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

the Fresno County Ordinance Code. Petitioners contend that Respondents have not complied
2 with CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, the Fresno County General Plan, and Fresno County
3 Ordinance Code, while Respondents contend that they have done so.

4 80. To remedy these violations of law, Petitioners request a declaration of the duties
5 of Respondents under CEQA, State Planning and Zoning Law, the Fresno County General Plan,
6 and Fresno County Ordinance Code, and a declaration that Respondents have not complied with
7 its duties under those provisions. Such declarations are a necessary and proper exercise of this
8 Court's power under section 1060 of the Code of Civil Procedure and under section 65000 of
9 the Government Code, to prevent violation of the Government Code, which requires that all
10 valid regulations shall be made "in accordance with standards prescribed by other provisions of
11 law."

12 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

13 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as follows:
14 1. For a peremptory writ of mandate pursuant to CEQA and the Code of Civil
15 Procedure section 1085 and Public Resources Code 21168.5, or, in the alternative, Code of Civil
16 Procedure section 1094.5 and Public Resources Code 21168.5, directing Respondents to vacate
17 and set aside their approval of the MND, General Plan Amendment, and Zoning Amendment
18 for the Project;

19 2. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents to comply with the
20 requirements of CEQA and take any other action required by the Public Resources Code
21 Section 21168.9, comply with the requirements of the County of Fresno General Plan, and
22 comply with the Fresno County Ordinance Code.

23 3. For declaratory relief under CEQA and the Code of Civil Procedure with respect
24 to the violations of law alleged in Petitioners' First through Fifth Causes of Action, as specified
25 in Petitioners' Sixth Cause of Action.

26 4. On Petitioners' First through Seventh Causes of Action, a temporary restraining
27 order, preliminary injunction, and a permanent injunction, enjoining Respondents from
