- INTRODUCTION

2 1.

3 This action challenges certain surreptitious acts and omissions by Respondents' CITY

4 OF EL PASO DE ROBLES and CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF EL PASO DE ROBLES

5 ("City") associated with (a) the City's June 5, 2018, approval of a property exchange agreement

6 ("Land Swap") with Real Parties in Interest ZEN PASO ROBLES, LLC and RUPESH PATEL

7 ("Zen"), and (b) the City's June 5, 2018, certification of a Mitigated Negative Declaration and

8 associated Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program for, and approval of, Zen's Hyatt Place
Hotel Planned Development (PD 17-011) ("Hotel Project").

9 2.

10 The City approved the Land Swap and Hotel Project without any analysis of the Land

11 Swap's significant environmental impacts; without evidence that the Land Swap is anything other

12 than a substantial waste of City property, to the detriment of the City's taxpayers and to the

13 exclusive and private benefit of Zen; and without adequate public disclosures or opportunities for
public review, comment, and input.

14 3.

15 The City's acts and omissions, and related approvals, constitute violations of the

16 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") (Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq.) and

17 CEQA Guidelines (title 14, California Code of Regulations, section 15000 et seq.); Government
Code sections 37350-51; and Code of Civil Procedure section 526a.

18 4.

19 The City's approvals of the Land Swap and Hotel Project, and each of the illegal acts

20 and omissions resulting in those approvals, constitute abuses of discretion on the part of the City. In

21 light of the City's grave violations of state laws enacted for the protection of the public's
fundamental rights to full public disclosure of the environmental impacts of projects under
22 consideration; judicious use and disposition of public property; and open and transparent

23

24 government proceedings, the City's approvals must be vacated and set aside. This action seeks to
enforce those important statutory rights affecting the public interest.

25 PARTIES

26 5.

27 Petitioner2 PACIFIC WEST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. ("Pacific. West") is a

28 "Respondents" shall mean "Respondents and/or Defendants." 2 "Petitioner" shall mean "Petitioner and/or Plaintiff."
Verified Pet. for Writ of Mandate & Complaint for Dec. & Inj. Relief

1 development company organized under the laws of the State of Arizona. It is owned entirely by

2 Petitioner KEVIN BIERL.

3 6. Petitioner KEVIN BIERL has an ownership interest in, and is the managing member

4 of, Petitioners PACIFIC COAST HOTEL PROPERTIES I, LLC (*PCHP I") and PACIFIC COAST
HOTEL PROPERTIES II, LLC ("PCHP II") (collectively, "LLC Petitioners"). Mr. Bierl and his

agents, both on his own behalf and on behalf of PCHP I and PCHP II, have submitted extensive

7 written and oral comments objecting to the City's acts and omissions leading up to, and including,

8 the approvals of the Land Swap and Hotel Project that are the subject of this lawsuit. As described in

9 greater detail below, all Petitioners are directly and beneficially interested in the outcome of this

10 case, including, without limitation, because of the direct and adverse impacts of the City's approvals

11 on Petitioners' property interests. In addition, PCHP I and PCHP pay taxes to the City and therefore
12 enjoy the right, as taxpayers, to restrain and prevent the waste of, or injury to, City-owned property.
13 7. Respondent CITY OF EL PASO DE ROBLES is the lead agency for the Land Swap
14 and Hotel Project, and has sole responsibility for conducting environmental revicw for those projects
15 and taking other actions necessary to comply with applicable state laws, including CEQA.

16 8. Respondent CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF EL PASO DE ROBLES is the

17 governing body of the City and is ultimately responsible for reviewing, and approving or denying,
18 the Land Swap and Hotel Project.

19 9. Petitioners do not know the true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate,

20 associate, or otherwise, of Respondents DOES 1 through 20, inclusive, and therefore sue said
21 Respondents under fictitious names. Petitioners will amend this petition and complaint to show their

22 true names and capacities when the same have been ascertained.

23 10. On information and belief, Real Party in Interest ZEN PASO ROBLES, LLC is a
24 California corporation based in Burlingame, California. Zen is record owner of the River Lodge

25 Parcel, which the City has agreed to receive in exchange for its valuable Theatre Drive Parcel,

26 pursuant to an illegal Land Swap.

27 11. On information and belief, Real Party in Interest RUPESH PATEL is the Hotel
28 Project applicant. As the project applicant, Mr. Patel is the recipient of the approvais granted by
3
Verified Pet. for Writ of Mandate & Complaint for Dec. & Inj. Relief

Respondents and is therefore a Real Party in Interest within the meaning of Public Resources Code

2 section 21167.6.5.

3 12. Petitioners do not know the true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate,

4 associate, or otherwise, of Real Parties in Interest DOES 21 through 40, inclusive, and therefore sue

5 said Real Parties in Interest under fictitious names. Petitioners will amend this Petition to show their

6 true names and capacities when the same have been ascertained.

7 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

8 13. This Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandate to set aside the City's Land

9 Swap and Hotel Project approvals under Code of Civil Procedure sections 526a, 1085 and 1094.5,

10 and Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.9. The Court also has jurisdiction to grant

11 declaratory relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 1060.

12 14. Venue is proper in this Court because this action challenges acts and omissions by

13 public officers by virtue of their offices, and the causes of action alleged in this Petition arose in the

14 County of San Luis Obispo. Venue is also proper in this Court because all of Respondents are

15 located in the County. Further, venue is proper in the Paso Robles Branch of this Court, because the
16 acts and omissions at issue took place in, and the properties that are the subject of this challenge are

17 located in, the Paso Robles.

18 15. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

19 21167.5 by serving written notice upon the City of the commencement of this action. A copy of the
20 written notice and proof of service is attached hereto as Exhibit A.
21 16. Petitioners have performed all conditions precedent to filing this action, and have

22 exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

23 17. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

24 unless this Court grants the requested equitable relief, requiring Respondents to set aside their

25 approvals of the Land Swap and Hotel Project. In the absence of such remedies, the decisions of

26 Respondents will remain in effect in violation of state laws and to the prejudice of Petitioners.

Verified Pet. for Writ of Mandate & Complaint for Dec. & Inj. Relief

1 STATEMENT OF FACTS

2 Mr. Bierl Helns Build Paso Robles' "Gateway" Into the City

3 18. Mr. Bierl launched his family-run hotel business in Paso Robles in 2001, with a

4 vision of helping to promote tourism in the City. Through PCHP I and II, he built and continues to

5 have an ownership interest in two hotels in the City: (1) the Hampton Inn & Suites, located at 206

6 Alexa Court, Paso Robles (APN 009-831-023), and (2) in La Bellasera Hotel and Suites, located at

7 212 Alexa Court (APN 009-831-022).

8 19. Both the Hampton Inn and La Bellasera are located at the southwest intersection of

9 State Route 46 and Highway 101. Given its high-profile location, the area where the hotels are
10 located is the "gateway" into the City, and provides visitors to the City with an important first
11 impression,

12 20. The Hampton Inn parcel is bordered to the immediate west by a City-owned 3.11-acre

13 parcel with APN 009-831-029, which lies at the southeast corner of State Route 46 and Theatre

14 Drive ("Theatre Drive Parcel). To the immediate south of the Hampton Inn and La Bellasera

15 parcels is a smaller, City-owned 1.03-acre parcel with APN 009-831-030. For several years, Mr.
16 Bierl made repeated offers to purchase the City-owned parcels surrounding the Hampton Inn and La
17 Bellasera. Given his unique interests and know-how, Mr. Bierl was well-positioned to develop those
18 properties in way that enhanced the area's "gateway" status. The City repeatedly represented to Mr.

19 Bierl that, when the time came for the City to sell, he would have the opportunity to bid for the City-

20 owned parcels in an open and transparent process, on equal footing with other potential buyers.
21 Zen Buys the Historie River Lodge Property Adjacent to Mr. Bierl's Hotels, Wrongly

22 Speculating That It Can Tear It Down and Build a New Hotel in Its Stead

23 21. In the meantime, Zen purchased from a private owner a 2.11-acre parcel improved

24 with the historic River Lodge Motel at 1955 Theatre Drive, to the immediate east of La Bellasera

25 ("River Lodge Parcel"). The motel was built around 1954 as part of a larger development that

26 included a drive-in theatre, gas station and restaurant.

27 22. On May 10, 2016, Zen applied to the City for a permit to demolish the River Lodge

28 Motel and, in its stead, build a 4-story, 116-room Hyatt Place Hotel. The City undertook an
5
Verified Pet. for Writ of Mandate & Complaint for Dec. & Inj. Relief™

-

2 extensive environmental analysis of Zen's project under CEQA. The ultimate result was the issuance

3 of a draft Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") that concluded that demolition of the River Lodge

4 Motel, al historic and cultural resource, would result in a "Class I, Significant Unavoidable

5 Environmental Impact" under CEQA. Members of the public spoke out against the motel's

6 demolition, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the existing River Lodge Motel and motel
sign as contributors to the unique historic character of the community. Those advocating for the

8 motel's preservation included the Paso Robles Historical Society and Paso Robles Mainstreet

9 Association. Further, the EIR concluded that the motel's proposed replacement-the Hyatt Place-

10 had problems of its own, given its significant height and mass, and its disruption of views (both from
the existing hotels to the west and from the highway to the east).

11 23.

12 In short, it became clear that it would be exceedingly difficult, if not legally and

13 politically impossible, for Zen to build a Hyatt Place Hotel on the River Lodge site. In order to

14 overcome a Class I impact and approve the Hyatt Place Hotel, the City would have to make detailed

15 findings supporting a "Statement of Overriding Considerations," establishing that specific economic,

16 social or other stated benefits are sufficient to warrant project approval despite the project's

17 significant and unavoidable adverse impacts. 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15093(a). Those findings must be

18 supported by substantial evidence. Id. § 15093(b). The City made no such "Statement of Overriding

19 Considerations," and the City and Zen abandoned the Hyatt Place Hotel project-at least as
proposed for the River Lodge Parcel.

20

21 The City Bails Out Zen in a Back-Room Deal That Gives Zen the City's Developable Theatre

22 Drive Parcel in Exchange for Zen's Undevelopable River Lodge Motel

24.

23 Sometime thereafter, the City began working behind closed doors on a plan that

24 would allow Zen to build its Hyatt Place Hotel on another parcel. In the end, and as detailed below,

25 the City would approve a lopsided deal to give away to Zen its vacant and fully developable Theatre

26 Drive Parcel in exchange for Zen's presumably undevelopable River Lodge Parcel. But not before it

27 would mislead the public for months about the true nature and import of its closed session meetings.

25.

28 Starting with its January 17, 2017, meeting, and at a number of meetings thereafter
through to and including its September 7 mceting, the City met in closed session purportedly to
6
Verified Pet. for Writ of Mandate & Complaint for Dec. & Inj. Relief

1 discuss the "[p]rice and terms of payment" related to the City's parcel to the immediate south of the

2 Hampton Inn (APN 009-831-030) not the Theatre Drive Parcel. For those closed-session
meetings, the City described the "negotiating parties" as Zenique Hotel (Mr. Patel's company) and

4 Pacific West, Mr. Bierl's company. The State's "open government" law applicable to local agencies,
the Brown Act, allows a local agency to meet in closed session to discuss real-estate negotiations

6 with its negotiator, but only "regarding the price and terms of payment for the purchase, sale,

7 exchange, or lease" of real property, Gov. Code § 54956.8.

8 26. During this time period, even though it was mentioned as a "negotiating party" in the
various agendas, Pacific West was not approached about any real-estate transaction. This, despite

10 past representations by the City that Mr. Bierl would have the opportunity to bid for any City-owned

11 parcel surrounding his hotels, if and when it was up for sale.

12 27. At its July 18, 2017, meeting, the City purportedly discussed in closed session the

13 "[p]rice and terms of payment" for the same parcel (i.e., APN 009-831-030, not the Theatre Drive

14 Parcel). But this time, the matter was agendized as one related to "Potential Litigation." In an cmail

15 to Mr. Bierl, Assistant City Manager Meg Williamson cryptically explained that the real-estate
16 transaction discussed in closed session-if consummated-would "address [his] stated concerns
17 with the proposed Hyatt project" contemplated for the River Lodge

18 Parcel. The minutes for the July 18 meeting later stated that the agenda had mistakenly characterized

19 the real-estate deal as one pertaining to "Potential Litigation," rather than "Real Property

20 Negotiations." If the City was indeed crafting a land swap to stave off potential litigation arising out
21 of Zen's inability to devclop the River Lodge Parcel, the City did not disclose that fact to the public

22 as it was required by law to do.

23 28. On September 12, 2017, the City's Planning Commission met to discuss a "Property
24 Exchange Agreement" agreed to between the City and Zen. That was the first time the public was

25 made aware that, in exchange for Zen's River Lodge Parcel, the City was proposing to convey to
26 Zen, not its southern parcel (APN 009-831-030) as described in past closed-session agendas, but its

27 valuable and fully developable Theatre Drive Parcel. The Planning Commission Agenda Report is
28 revcaling. It makes clear that, because the City was not in a position to approve Zen's proposed
7
Verified Pet. for Writ of Mandate & Complaint for Dec. & Inj. Relief

- Hyatt hotel on the River Lodge Parcel, given the Class I significant and unavoidable impacts

2 associated with demolition of the historic motel, the City was working on a "two-party exchange"

3 between it and Zen. Again, the public had no notice of the back-room deal until after the City and

4 Zen agreed to the exchange, and it certainly had no indication that the land swap might be the City's

5 way of settling threatened litigation by Zen.

6 29. Notably, the September 12, 2017, Planning Commission Agenda Report suggests that
7 all of the prior closed sessions concerning the City's alleged "negotiations" had nothing whatever to

8 do with giving the City's negotiator authority regarding "[p]rice and terms of payment." The City's
closed-session agendas between January and September 2017 were misleading to the public and did

10 not disclose the true nature of the discussions: namely, to effectuate pure land swap to the benefit

11 of a private party (Zen).

12 30. At its September 19, 2017 meeting, the City Council considered and conditionally

13 a approved a property exchange agreement with Zen, whereby the City would give Zen the Theatre
14 Drive Parccl in exchange for Zen's River Lodge Parcel. But the City did not definitively commit

15 itself to that Land Swap. To the contrary, council members expressed serious reservations about the
16 swap, based on the absence of professional appraisal establishing the parcels' relative values. The
17 land swap was proposed by City staff on the basis only of a broker's opinion that the two parcels
18 were sufficiently similar in value to support an exchange, but some council members wanted more.
19 31. On the basis of legitimate concerns about the parcels' relative values, the City

20 Council adopted a motion only conditionally approving the Land Swap pending an appraisal of the
21 two parcels and a re-evaluation of the transaction based on that appraisal's findings. The City

22 Council made clear that the tentative approval could be withdrawn, if the appraisal did not justify the

23 swap. The City did not say definitively what it planned to do with the River City it Lodge Parcel, if

24 and when it acquired it that parcel as part of the swap. While its prior EIR for the Hyatt Hotel Project
25 on the site suggested that the motel would have to be preserved, the City also suggested that it might

26 be developed, depending on the community's input. Needless to say, the City did not undertake any

27 environmental analysis of the potential environmental impacts associated with the land swap,

28 including reasonably foresceable uses or developments of the two exchanged parcels.
8
Verified Pet. for Writ of Mandate & Complaint for Dec. & Inj. Relief

32. On November 19, 2017, Zen applied for a permit to build its Hotel Project on the

2 Theatre Drive Parcel (once conveyed to Zen). At its December 13, 2017 meeting, the City Council

3 instructed its consultants to a prepare a Mitigated Negative Declaration for that Hotel Project. At its

4 April 25, 2018, meeting, the Planning Commission adopted resolutions recommending that the City

5 Council adopt a Mitigated Negative Declaration and Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program

6 for the Hotel Project and that it approve the Hotel Project.

7 33. In the meantime, the City Council continued to meet in closed session concerning

8 some version of the land swap between up through and including at its May 15, 2018 meeting. The
City Council's agenda for its January 16, 2018, closed session describes negotiations over the

10 Theatre Drive Parcel, but its April 3 and May 15 closed-session agenda contrarily describe

11 negotiations over the southern parcel (APN 009-831-030). The City Council never clarified for the

12 public what it was discussing in closed session, and why---given the land swap involved no price or

13 terms of payment-it was meeting in closed session in the first place, and not in a public hearing.

14 The City Approves the Land Swap and Hotel Project for Zen's Private Benefit, at a Significant

15 Loss to Taxpayers, and Without Revicwing the Swap's Environmental Impacts

16 34. At its June 5, 2018, meeting, the City Council committed to and authorized the land

17 swap, based on a "preliminary" appraisal (dated January 10, 2018); the final appraisal was not made

18 available to the public. The appraisal concluded that the two parcels were of roughly equivalent

19 value, based on the unsubstantiated assumption that the River Lodge Motel Parcel would be

20 developed with a new hotel after demolition of the historical motel currently located there. That

21 assumption finds no evidentiary support in the record and conflicts with the City's EIR for the

22 original Hyatt Place Hotel project and Zen's subsequent abandonment of that project, which

23 evidence the legal and political infeasibility of any new development on the River Lodge Parcel. In

24 short, the appraisal does not support the conclusion that the two parcels are of substantially equal

25 value, and substantial evidence in the record indicates that the River Lodge Parcel was substantially

26 overvalued.

27 35. Also at its June 5 meeting, the City approved Zen's Hotel Project on the Theatre

28 Drive Parcel, following certification of a Mitigated Negative Declaration and A Mitigation

Verified Pet. for Writ of Mandate & Complaint for Dec. & Inj. Relief

-

2 Monitoring and Reporting Program. The City did not analyze the environmental impacts associated

3 with the Land Swap, including the reasonable likelihood-as the City's own appraisal assumes-

4 that the historic River Lodge Motel will be demolished and a new hotel (or other) development
approved in its place.

5 36.

6 On June 7, the City filed its Notice of Determination, indicating it certified a

7 Mitigated Negative Declaration and Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program, and also

8 approved the Hotel Project for the Theatre Drive Parcel. The Notice of Determination does not
mention approval of the Land Swap and the

9 Lodge Parcel may be re-developed. prospect that, as a consequence of that swap, the River

10 37.

11 Mr. Biel, on behalf of himself and co-Petitioners, regularly communicated to the City

12 his concerns and objections about the City's acts and omissions leading to approval of the Land

13 Swap and the Hotel Project, as well as about the approvals themselves. Further, Petitioners' attorney

14 sent a July 2, 2018, letter to the City Council advising them of the legal deficiencies in their

15 approvals, which are the grounds for Petitioners' claims herein. Among other things, the letter

16 demanded that the City cure or correct its Brown Act violations. When the time for the City to act on

17 that demand has expired, and if the City's response is inadequate, Petitioners intend to amend this

18 petition and complaint to state a cause of action for violations of the Brown Act.
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

19 FOR VIOLATION OF CEQA

20 38. (By All Petitioners Against All Respondents)

21 their entirety. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference herein the preceding paragraphs in

22 39.

23 CEQA applies to any discretionary action taken by an agency that may cause a
reasonably foreseeable change in the environment.

24 40.

25 CEQA requires that an agency prepare an EIR a for a project whenever substantial

26 evidence in the record supports a fair argument a that the project may have a significant impact on the

27 environment. The EIR is the cornerstone of the CEQA process and discloses a project's potential

28 adverse environmental impacts. The EIR also informs decision-makers, responsible agencies, and
the public of alternative mitigation measures, project elements, or project designs that would lessen
10
Verified Pet. for Writ of Mandate & Complaint for Dec. & Inj. Relief

or avoid the project's environmental impacts.

2 41. CEQA requires that an EIR include an accurate project description, and that the

3 nature and objective of a project be fully disclosed and fairly evaluated in the BIR.

4 42. CEQA also mandates that the lead agency adopt feasible and enforceable mitigation

5 measures that would reduce or avoid any of the project's significant environmental impacts. If

6 substantial evidence in the record supports a fair argument that any of the project's significant
7 environmental impacts cannot be mitigated to a less than significant level, an agency may not rely on

8 a Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND") and must instead prepare an EIR.

9 43. The City's approvals of a exchange of its land for private land, and of a development

10 permit, constitute discretionary approvals of projects that trigger the City's obligation to comply
11 with CEQA.

12 44. The City violated CEQA when it approved the Land Swap, a "project" under CEQA,

13 for the following non-exclusive list of reasons:

14 a. The Land Swap, if consummated, will result in the development of the T'heatre Drive

15 Parcel, the development of improvements related to access at the site, and (if the City-

16 commissioned appraisal is to be accepted) the demolition of a historic motel (a Class ]

17 impact) and the re-development of the River Lodge Parcel with a new hotel. Yet the

18 City failed to undertake any environmental review of the Land Swap's impacts in

19 violation of CEQA.

20 b. The City failed to accurately describe the nature, scope, and purpose of the swap, in
21 violation of the CEQA's mandate requiring an accurate project description.

22 45. In the alternative, the City violated CEQA when it approved the Hotel Project, for the

23 following non-exclusive list of reasons:

24 a. The City failed to accurately describe the Hotel Project, when it failed to disclose in

25 any environmental document prepared for the Hotel Project that said project is

26 dependent upon, and inextricably connected to, the Land Swap. That violates

27 CEQA's mandate requiring an accurate project description.

28 b. If the City-commissioned appraisal is to be accepted, the Land Swap will have a
11

1 Class I significant and unavoidable impact (destruction of a historical motel). As a

2 conscquence, the City could not rely on an MND, but instead had to prepare an EIR
3 evaluating the impacts of the Hotel Project, which rests on the Land Swap. Because
4 the City failed to prepare an EIR considering those impacts, the City violated CEQA.

5 46. By failing to comply with CEQA as described above, the City committed a

6 prejudicial abuse of discretion, failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and did not make the
7 necessary findings or adduce the necessary evidence to support its conclusions.

8 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

9 FOR VIOLATION OF GOVERNMENT CODE §§ 37350-51 (By All Petitioners Against All Respondents)
10 47. Petitioners re-alleged and incorporate by reference herein the preceding paragraphs in

11 their entirety.

12 48. California law expressly limits the power of cities to buy, sell, or exchange land.
13 49. Section 37350 of the Government Code provides that a city "may purchase, lease,
14 receive, hold and enjoy real and personal property, and control and dispose of it for the common

15 benefit. Gov't Code cc 37350 (emphasis added). Section 37351 further provides that the city "may

16 purchase, lease, exchange, or receive such personal property and real estate situated inside or outside
17 the city limits as is necessary or proper for municipal purposes," and "may control, dispose of, and

18 convey such property for the benefit of the city." Id. § 37351 (emphasis added).

19 50. The City's approval of the Land Swap violates both statutes. There is insufficient

20 evidence in the record to support the finding that the Theatre Drive and River Lodge Parcels are of

21 substantially equal valuc. Indeed, the evidence indicates that the River Lodge Parcel, given the Class

22 impacts associated with any likely re-development project, is of substantially lower value than the

23 Theatre Drive parcel.

24 51. Given the difference in values between the exchanged parcels, the City cannot

25 establish that its exchange is for "the common benefit," was "necessary or proper for municipal
26 purposes, or was for "the benefit of the city." Gov. Code § 37350-01. Certainly, the City does not
27 need to acquire the River Lodge Parcel in order to preserve it, for there is no indication that the
28 historic structure is subject to demolition and replacement anyway, whether or not the City owns it.
12
Verified Pet. for Writ of Mandate & Complaint for Dec. & Inj. Relief

1 The apparent purpose of the land swap seems to have been to substantially benefit a private party-

2 namely, Zen and its owner, Mr. Patel.
3 52. Because the Land Swap was not for the common benefit of the City, and was not

4 necessary or proper for any municipal purpose other than to placate a private party, the City's
5 approval violates sections 37350 and 37351 of the Government Code.

6 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

7 FOR TAXPAYER WASTE (CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE § 526a) (By LLC Petitioners Against All Respondents)

8 53. Petitioners re-alleged and incorporate by reference herein the preceding paragraphs in

9 their entirety.

10 54. The LLC Petitioners have been assessed and are liable to pay, or within one year
11 before the commencement of this action have paid, taxes to the State of California, the County of

12 San Luis Obispo, and the City.

13 55. The City approved a land swap, whereby it would convey its Theatre Drive Parcel for

14 Zen's River Lodge Parcel. Yet there is insufficient evidence establishing that the two parcels are of

15 substantially the same value. To the contrary, the evidence indicates that the Theatre Drive Parcel-a

16 fully developable parcel-is worth far more than the River Lodge Parcel, which has significant

17 development constraints due to the existence of a historic motel on site.

18 56. Further, in approving the Land Swap, the City violated a number of state laws, as
19 alleged herein.

20 57. The City's approval of the Land Swap constitutes an illegal waste of City property
21 and funds, an actionable violation of law under 526a of the Code of Civil Procedure.

22 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

23 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as follows:

24 1. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to vacate and

25 set aside all approvals associated with the Land Swap and the Hotel Project;

26 2. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to comply
27 with CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines;

28 3. For a declaration that the Land Swap is unlawful under Government Code sections
13
Verified Pet. for Writ of Mandate & Complaint for Dec. & Inj. Relief

37350-51, and Code of Civil Procedure section 526a.

2 4. For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent

3 injunctions retraining Respondents and their agents, servants, and employees, and all others acting in

4 concert with Respondents on their behalf, from taking any action to implement the Land Swap and

5 Hotel Project, pending full compliance with the requirements of CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines,

6 Government Code sections 37350-51, Code of Civil Procedure section 526a, and all other applicable
7 laws;

8 5. For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent

9 injunctions retraining Real Parties in Interest and their agents, servants, and employees, and all

10 others acting in concert with Real Parties in Interest on their behalf, from taking any action to

11 implement the Land Swap and Hotel Project, pending full compliance with the requirements of

12 CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, Government Code sections 37350-51, Code of Civil Procedure

13 section 526a, and all other applicable laws;

14 6. For costs of suit;

15 7. For attorneys' fees as authorized by Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 and other

16 provisions of law; and

17 8. For such other and future relief as the Court deems just and proper.
