PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) M

-

2 the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), and Los Angeles Municipal Code section

3 17.05-R, and allege:

INTRODUCTION
4
1.
5 This action challenges the approval by the City Council of the City of Los

6 Angeles of the Pico/Gateway Project, which would develop "a new, five-story 129-unit multi-

7 family residential building .. . over a two-level subterranean garage" on a 43,204 square-foot

8 (0.99 acres) lot to be formed by the merger of two commercial parcels with a public alleyway the

9 City proposes to vacate. The City's vacation of the alleyway is a gift of public funds, and the

10 City's approval of a Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND") for the Project violated CEQA

11 because there was more than substantial evidence of a fair argument that the Project may have a

12 significant impact regarding air quality and health risks to nearby sensitive receptors, and

13 impacts on protected trees in violation of Los Angeles Municipal Code section 17.05-R. At the

14 last minute, the City contended the Project was exempt from CEQA review under Public

15 Resources Code section 21155.1, however, as Petitioner noted, the exemption does not apply if

16 the Project is "located on developed open space," and the public alleyway the City sought to

17 vacate qualifies.

2.
18 Petitioner seeks to set aside these approvals:

a.
19 City Council File Number 17-0932 City Council Action dated December 5, 2017,

20 purporting to approve a Mitigated Negative Declaration and a Planning and Land Use

21 Management (*PLUM") Committee Report relative to a Vesting Tentative Tract appeal for the

22 property at 11460-11488 West Gateway Boulevard, 2426 South Colby Avenue, and 2425 South

23 Butler Avenue,

b.
24 Purported amended findings forwarded to the City Council after the PLUM

25 Committee and City Council's consideration of the Project, on December 14, 2017, and

C.
26 3. Any other findings adopted or purportedly adopted by the City Council.

27 On information and belief, a Notice of Determination for the Project was posted

28 on or after December 6, 2017, the day after the City Council took final action on the Project.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 2

4. The City Council is the ultimate land-use authority and decision-making body in
2

3 the City of Los Angeles, although in this case it purported to delegate its authority to a Deputy
Advisor on the Planning Department staff (who originally purported to certify the MND), and 4 then to the Planning Commission (which then purported to certify the MND), and then also to
5 the PLUM Committee. Petitioner alleges these delegations were unlawful.
6
JURISDICTION AND VENUE; PRIORITY
7 5. This Court has jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and
8
1094.5. The Court has jurisdiction of CEQA matters under Pub. Resources Code sections 21168,
9
21168.5, and 21168.9.
10
6. Venue is proper in this Court because the City of Los Angeles is in Los Angeles
11 County and the Project is located here, so the actions giving rise to the causes of action herein
12 transpired in Los Angeles County, and the impacts of those actions would be felt here. See Code
13 of Civil Procedure sections 393 and 394.
14
7. This action is timely filed within 30 days of posting the Notice of Determination
15 for this Project under CEQA on December 6, 2017.
16
8. Petitioner has exhausted their administrative remedies by commenting on the
17 Project prior to the close of the public hearing thereon, which was the public hearing before the
18 City Council on December 5, 2017, and before the Notice of Determination is filed thereon, in
19 compliance with Public Resources Code section 21177(b).
20
9. Petitioner has complied with CEQA by filing and serving prior to this Petition for
21 Writ of Mandate a Notice of Intent to File under Public Resources Code section 21167.5, a true
22 of correct copy of which is attached as Exhibit A, by complying with Public Resources Code
23 section 21167.6 in notifying the Respondents of Petitioner's election to prepare the
24 administrative record (a copy of which notice is filed contemporaneously), and by complying
25 with Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 in
26 notifying the Attorney General of the commencement of this action, a copy of which is filed
27 I contemporaneously.
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 3

1
10. If the City claims that the vacation of this public alleyway is a "public
2 improvement project", that portion of this action may have priority under Code of Civil
3
Procedure section 526a.
4
PARTIES
5
11. Petitioner Civic Interspace is an unincorporated not-for-profit association devoted
6 to the preservation of the environment and the promotion of safe and healthy communities.
7 Civic Interspace sues on behalf of itself and neighbors of the Project and the general public and
8 is acting as a private attorney general conferring a significant benefit on the general public or a
9 large class of persons under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.
10 12. Petitioner Henrietta Conrad is over eighteen years of age and is a resident and
11 taxpayer of the City of Los Angeles and a close neighbor of the Project. She has standing to
12 challenge the Project under CEQA as she commented on the Project prior to its ultimate
13 approval, and to challenge the Project under the California Constitution and case law under Code
14 of Civil Procedure section 526a.
15
12. Respondent City of Los Angeles is a municipal corporation in Los Angeles
16 County with jurisdiction over the area encompassed by the proposed Project. The City is the
17 entity charged with authority of regulating and administering land use and development within
18 its territory in compliance with its General Plan, zoning ordinances, and Municipal Code, and
19 applicable provisions of CEQA and the State Constitution.
20 13. Respondent City Council of Los Angeles is the elected and decision-making body
21 within the City ultimately responsible for land use and planning decisions within the City. Under
22 established case law, Respondent City Council is the "lead agency" responsible for making the
23 findings under CEQA. Petitioner filed an appeal of the Planning Commission's decision based
24 upon the appeal of others of the Deputy Advisory Agency's decision to the Planning
25 Commission. Under established case law, Petitioner needs not have filed subsidiary appeals.
26
14. Real Party in Interest 11460 Gateway, LLC is an unknown entity that was listed
27 as the Applicant for the Project on Respondent City's determination documents, including the
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 4

1 Notice of Determination issued for the Project.
2
15. Real Party in Interest Randy Kirshner is believed to be an individual who was also
3 listed as the Applicant on Respondent City's Notice of Determination issued for the Project.
4
16. Real Parties in Interest Does 1-10 are sued herein by fictitious name. Their true
5 names and capacities are unknown to Petitioner. When their true names and capacities are
6 ascertained, Petitioner will amend this Petition by inserting them. Petitioner is informed and
7 believes and thereon alleges that the fictitiously named Real Parties are responsible in some way
8
for the occurrences alleged herein.
9 17. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that each of the Real
10
Parties gave consent to, ratified, or authorized the alleged acts herein, and that each of the Real
11 Parties knowingly aided, abetted or conspired with the others to commit the acts alleged herein.
12 STATEMENT OF FACTS AND COMMON ALLEGATIONS
13
18. Violations of CEQA and the City's Protected Tree Ordinance. In approving the
14 Project, the City and City Council violated the basic premise of CEQA that where there is
15 substantial evidence of a fair argument there may be a significant impact, an Environmental
16 Impact Report must be prepared. The City attempted to reject expert evidence supporting the
17 conclusion that more than a significant impact would result from the Project; this is something it
18 did not have the discretion to do under Guidelines § 15064(g).
19 19. Air Quality. The Project will involve significant amounts of construction using
20 diesel trucks and machines that emit diesel particulate matter ("DPM"), a Toxic Air Contaminant
21 (*TAC") subject to state and federal scrutiny. The Project will further involve the emissions of
22 TACs such as DPM during its operation when there are diesel truck deliveries to or from the site.
23 Based on no evidence, the City issued an MND concluding there was no health risk to neighbors
24 of the Project from the construction and operation of Project. In response, Petitioner Henrietta
25 Conrad submitted evidence of a significant health risk to sensitive receptors -- schoolchildren,
26 and residents located to the northeast and southeast of the Project site. Specifically, Petitioner
27 submitted a health risk screening assessment ("HRSA") prepared by Soil Water Air Protection
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA)

Enterprise ("SWAPE"), which has expertise in air quality issues. SWAPE's analysis disclosed
2
that:
3

4 The excess cancer risk to adults, children, and infants at the MEIR located approximately 1 meter away, over the course of Project construction and operation are 81, 450, and 220, in one million, respectively. Furthermore, the
5 excess cancer risk over the course of a residential lifetime (30 years) at the MEIR

6 is approximately 750 in one million.
SWAPE arrived at these numbers using industry-standard practices, specifically, the use of South
7 Coast Air Quality Management District ("SCAQMD") and Office of Environmental Health
8 Hazard Assessment ("OEHHA") guidance.
9
20. In response, the City did a purported Health Risk Assessment. Although that
10 Health Risk Assessment ("HRA" or "Assessment") did not follow the guidance of OEHHA or
11 the EPA's Science Advisory Board regarding Age Sensitivity Factors for early life exposures to
12 allegedly non-mutagenic substances, although the Assessment used an exposure duration of 260
13 versus 360 days, and although the Assessment only addressed risks from construction, and not
14 construction and operation, it still concluded that the risk to adults at the closest residence was 10
15 in a million, which is the exact figure comprising the applicable SCAQMD significance
16 threshold for risk.
17 21. Had the developer's consultant done any of the above steps properly, it therefore
18 would have found a health risk of greater than 10 in a million, which would exceed the
19 SCAQMD threshold and represent a significant impact. As it is, the developer's consultant's
20 HRA is, combined with the work of SWAPE, substantial evidence that there may be a significant
21 impact from the Project, so an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") was required.
22
22. In response to Petitioner's evidence, which came as part of an appeal of the
23 approval of the Project by the Planning Commission, City staff unbelievably contended that the
24 MND was supposedly immune from attack because, supposedly, it was only required if the
25 standards for a "new environmental review" were met under CEQA Guidelines §§ 15162 and
26 15164. These Guidelines specifically have to do with subsequent review for previously certified
27 EIRs or MNDs, which the present MND was not, because it was on appeal when the evidence
28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 6

was presented. As at least one Court of Appeal has noted, The City Council of the City of Los
2 Angeles is the lead agency for CEQA purposes. Thus, there simply was no final, certified
3
CEQA document at issue here.
4
23. Protected Trees. Another reason why there was substantial evidence that there
5 could be a significant impact under CEQA came from the City's MND itself (and was raised
6 during the MND and on appeal to the Planning Commission). The MND discloses there are two
7 Western Sycamore trees (Plantanus racemosa) on the edge of the Project site. The Western
8 Sycamore is a protected tree under City Ordinance No. 177,404, so long as the tree has a
diameter of four inches or more a four and a half feet above the ground at the base of the tree.
10 These trees do, each having a trunk diameter of 20 inches at the measuring height.
11 24. As the Planning Commission Appeal Report disclosed, Los Angeles Municipal
12 Code section 17.05-R provides that protected trees may not be removed unless:
13

14 1. There has been prior applicable government action, or 2. The removal of the protected tree would not result in an undesirable, irreversible soil erosion through diversion or increased flow of surface waters 15 that cannot be mitigated to the satisfaction of the City's Chief Forester, and the

16 physical condition or location of the tree is such that: a. Its continued presence in its existing location prevents the reasonable development of the property; or 17 b. According to a report required pursuant to Section 17.06 C., acceptable to the Advisory Agency and prepared by a tree expert, there
18 is a substantial decline from a condition of normal health and vigor of the tree, and its restoration through appropriate and economically
19 reasonable preservation procedures and practices is not advisable; or c. It is in danger of falling due to an existing and irreversible 20 condition; or

21 d. Its continued presence at its existing location interferes with proposed utility services or roadways within or without the subject

22 property, and the only reasonable alternative to the interference is the removal of the tree; or

23 e. It has no apparent aesthetic value, which will contribute to the appearance and design of the proposed subdivision; or f. It is not located with reference to other trees or monuments in such
24 a way as to acquire distinctive significance at the location.
25 Los Angeles Municipal Code § 17.05(R)(1), (a) and (b). The removal of the Western Sycamores

26 ("the Protected Trees") satisfied neither Condition 1 nor any of the requirements in Condition 2. 1

27 Specifically, the City was relying upon Condition 2.a, that the tree's continued presence it its
28 existing location "prevents the reasonable development of the property." This simply was not
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 7

1 the case. The Protected Trees are on the edge of the property - actually, on the edge of a second
2 property which was not even merged with the property, absent the Council's action. And the
3 City in enacting this section of the Municipal Code intended that developers and property owners
work with protected trees on their property so this aspect of the Ordinance would not come into
5 play unless no reasonable development of the property was possible without removal of the
6
Protected Trees. There was no evidence, much less substantial evidence, that "no" reasonable
7 development of the property could occur absent the Protected Trees. . The City did nothing more
8
than to assert that this particular development could not go forward without removal of the
9 Protected Trees. The City's interpretation of the exception in section 2(a) of its Municipal Code
10 would swallow the rule.
11
25. The City not only violated its own Municipal Code by approving the removal of
12 the Protected Trees, it also violated CEQA, because CEQA Guidelines Appendix G provides that
13 there is a significant impact to the environment if a project will "Conflict with any local policies
14 or ordinances protecting biological resources, such as a tree preservation policy or ordinance."
15 Guidelines Appendix G, § IV(e).'
16
26. Constitutional Violation Relating to Vacation of a Public Alleyway without
17 Adequate Compensation; Further CEQA Issues. Established Supreme Court case law clarifies
18 that the vacation of a public street or alleyway without adequate compensation is gift of public
19 funds, which violates California Constitution Article XVI, section 6. Courts have interpreted this
20 provision to include all payments of public money for which there is no authority or enforceable
21 claim, and dedications of public property without proper compensation. In Harman v. City and
22 County of San Francisco (1972) 7 Cal. 3d 150, the Supreme Court ruled that a city's vacation of
23 streets or alleyways for some, but less than full, compensation constituted a gift of public funds.
24

25 The MND also noted that there were five carrotwood trees onsite ("Carrotwood Trees") which the Project proposed to remove and conceded that because these trees had trunks of
26 eight inches or more in diameter, they were considered significant trees for CEQA purposes. The City contended that four of these trees, on Gateway Boulevard, had been "topped,'
27 though a member of the public testified this happened only after the MND had been issued. The City's mitigation for the removal of these trees was inadequate, requiring only that they
28 should be replaced on a 1:1 ratio with a 24-inch box tree, which is much smaller than the size of the trees proposed to be removed.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 8

1 Petitioner and others raised this issue throughout the administrative process.
2
27. On information and belief, the developer obtained the public alleyway property
3 for its private, highly lucrative development for the payment of an approximate $15,000
4
application fee.
5
28. This public alleyway runs along the rough north of the Project site from West
6 Pico Boulevard at its intersection with Exposition Boulevard, to the beginning of Butler Avenue,
7 where it is presently gated, and also to an alley between the homes on Butler Avenue and those
8 on Colby Avenue, where it is also gated.? Nevertheless, the public alleyway is

26 Residents also identified as a CEQA issue that the City newly proposed to use the alley behind the homes between Butler and Colby Avenues as a fire lane, when those residents had
27 previously successfully petitioned to gate the alleyway off because leaving it open had it engendered more crime, graffiti, and trash dumping within the community. The City
28 completely refused to address the risks to the community from the likely re-opening of that alleyway in order to provide a new fire lane.

20 29. The City and the developer made various arguments on why this was legal, none
21 of which are supported. First, the City contended that the public alley as proposed to be merged
22 "is not necessary for present and future public use," and that "Any potentially displaced traffic
23 could be easily accommodated by Butler Avenue and would provide the same circulation
24 pattern." Members of the public testified that they used the alleyway, however, and Figure 4
25 depicts circulation that the alleyway proposed to be vacated provides circulation that the Project
26 will eliminate. More to the point, the City may not give away public property for free, even if it
27 has no use, which has not been established.

30. The developer shifted gears before the City's Planning and Land Use

23 "Subdivided lands may be merged and resubdivided without reverting to acreage . . ." This

24 section has nothing to do with the City's Constitutional obligation to be paid for public lands

25 which it vacates into the hands of a private owner or developer, as the Harman case clarifies.

26 31. The City also contended that the vacation of the alleyway was justified because it
27 | would receive a "Fire Department Turnaround" on the private property "which would allow the
28 City to fully improve the public alley while maintaining fire safety standards." There simply was
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 12

1 no basis for the conclusion that this justified the vacation of a public alleyway for no
2 compensation. A Fire Department Turnaround was required for the safety of future Project
3 residents as a Code matter; in other words, it was the developer's obligation to provide such a
4 turnaround, and it served the residents of the Project only, not the larger public.
5
32. Residents further addressed the CEQA issue of traffic safety regarding using the
6 alleyway at its intersection between West Pico and Exposition as the sole point of ingress and
7 egress for all residents to the parking for the newly proposed structures. The City failed to
8 respond to this issue except regarding pedestrian safety, on which the City identified several
9 "project design features" which it did not impose as conditions of approval for the Project.
10 There is substantial evidence of a fair argument that the Project would have a significant impact
11 on both vehicle safety and pedestrian safety.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
21 Failure to Prepare an EIR
22 [CEQA, Pub. Res. Code 88 21000 et seq. All Respondents]
23
33. Petitioner reincorporates and realleges paragraphs 1 through 32 as if set forth.
24 CEQA requires that a lead agency prepare an EIR whenever it can be fairly argued based on
25 substantial evidence that a project may have a significant environmental impact. If there is
26 substantial evidence in the whole record supporting a fair argument that a project may have a
27 significant nonmitigable effect on the environment, the lead agency shall prepare an EIR, even
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 14

though it may also be presented with other substantial evidence that the project will not have a
2 significant effect. Pub. Resources Code § 21151(a).
3
34. In the MND the City failed to acknowledge that there was a fair argument of
4 potentially significant impacts as to air quality, biological resources consisting of protected trees,
5 sanitation, crime and public safety. Confronted with credible expert opinion and/or substantial
6 evidence in the record as to all these issues, the City should have prepared an EIR.
7
35. The City's refusal to prepare an EIR was not based on substantial evidence and
8 was a failure to proceed according to law.
9
36. The City should have circulated an EIR for the Project.
10 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
11 Failure to Analyze All Potentially Significant Impacts; Findings Not Based on Substantial
12 Evidence
13 [CEQA, Pub. Res. Code §§ 21000 et seq. - All Respondents]
14 37. Petitioner reincorporates and realleges paragraphs 1 through 36 as if set forth.
15 38. CEQA requires that a lead agency identify all potentially significant impacts of a
16 project. It further requires that the lead agency's findings must be based on substantial evidence.
17 Pub. Resources Code § 21082.2.
18 39. The City failed to identify potentially significant impacts as to air quality,
19 biological resources in terms of protected trees and other trees, sanitation, crime and public
20 safety. Its findings that these impacts were not significant, and that they were mitigated to a less
21 than significant level, were not based on substantial evidence.
22 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
23 Failure to Mitigate Significant Impacts: Findings Not Based on Substantial Evidence
24 [CEQA, Pub. Res. Code $8 21000 et seq. - All Respondents]
25
40. Petitioner reincorporates and realleges paragraphs 1 through 39 as if set forth.
26 41. CEQA requires an agency to adopt feasible mitigation measures that will
27 substantially lessen or avoid the project's potentially significant impacts and to describe those
28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 15

1 mitigation measures in the MND. Pub. Res. Code § 21081.6(b). This obligation is doubly
2 important with an MND as it depends for its existence upon a finding of no significant impacts.
3 42. A lead agency must impose all feasible mitigation measures to reduce impacts to
less than significant levels.

43. The MND failed to impose feasible mitigation measures to mitigate significant
6 impacts to air quality, to the Protected Trees and the Carrotwood Trees, and it failed to consider,
7 much less mitigate, impacts to sanitation, crime and public safety as testified to by members of
8 the community.
9
44. The City's failure to adopt these measures represented a failure to proceed by law
10 in violation of CEQA.
11 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
12 Illegal Gift of Public Funds
13 [Cal. Const., Art. XVI § 6 - All Respondents]
14 45. Petitioner reincorporates and realleges paragraphs 1 through 44 as if set forth.
15
46. The City's vacation of a portion of a public alleyway for use by a private
16 developer, without any compensation therefor, was a gift of public funds in violation of the
17 California Constitution and established case law interpreting it.
18 47. The City's purported vacation of this public space should be rescinded and
19 enjoined or prohibited by writ of mandate.
20 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION
21 Violation of and Failure to Comply with Mandatory Duties
22 [Los Angeles Municipal Code § 17.05(R)(1)(a), (b) - All Respondents]
23
48. Petitioner reincorporates and realleges paragraphs 1 through 47 as if set forth.
24 49. Los Angeles Municipal Code section 17.05(R)(1) prohibits the City from
25 approving the removal of the Protected Trees unless one of the conditions of section
26 17.05(R)(1)(b)(i) through (v) are met. Here, the City relied upon subsection (b)(i), asserting that
27 the location of the Protected Trees "prevents the reasonable development of the property." There
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 16

-

2 was no basis for the City to conclude that, as there were no other plans submitted to the City

3 demonstrating that the reasonable use of the property was precluded, the Protected Trees are on
the edge of the proposed merged parcel, and the Protected Trees are not even a part of the

primary parcel which the applicant seeks to develop. There is simply no evidence in the record

6 that the Protected Trees "prevent[] the reasonable development of the property."

7 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays:

1.
8 For the Court's peremptory writ of mandate requiring the City to set aside its

9 decision approving the MND for the Project (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168, 21168.5,

10 21168.9, Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085, 1094.5),

2.
11 For the Court's peremptory writ of mandate requiring City to fully comply with

12 the requirements of CEQA (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168, 21168.5, 21168.9, Code of

13 Civil Procedure §§ 1085, 1094.5),

3.
14 For a judgment enforcing the duty imposed upon City by CEQA to prepare an

15 EIR adequately addressing potential individual and cumulative impacts to the

16 4. environment in any subsequent action taken regarding the Project,

17 For a judgment enforcing the duty imposed upon the City by CEQA to adequately

18 consider mitigation to reduce significant impacts in any subsequent action taken

19 to approve the Project,

5.
20 For a judgment enforcing the duty imposed upon the City by CEQA to prepare,

21 circulate and consider a legally adequate Environmental Impact Report and

22 otherwise comply with CEQA in any subsequent action taken to approve this

23 Project,

6.
24 For a writ of mandate and judgment rescinding any vacation of the public

25 alleyway at issue in this proceeding and prohibiting the City from vacating that

26 alleyway without full compensation therefor;

7.
27 For a writ of mandate and judgment requiring the City to enforce the terms of its

28 own Protected Tree Ordinance, Los Angeles Municipal Code section 17.05(R),

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 17

and prohibiting the removal of the Protected Trees at issue in this case;
2
8. For costs of suit, including attorney's fees under Code of Civil Procedure
3 1021.5 and other provisions of law, and
4
9. For such other and further relief, including a stay or preliminary or permanent
5 injunctive relief, in the event that City, the Applicant of the Applicant's designee
