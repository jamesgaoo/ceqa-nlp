N mtnnON . Petitioners We Advocate Thorough Environmental Review and Winnemem Wintu Tribe
(collectively "Petitioners") petition this Court for a Writ of Mandate, directed to Respondents
City of Mount Shasta and City of Mount Shasta City Council ("Respondents"). Petitioner
challenges Respondents' March 26, 2018, approval of the Industrial Waste Discharge Permit for
Crystal Geyser IWD-2018-01 ("IWDP" or "Project"); and the conclusion that the Permit was
adequately considered in the Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") prepared by the lead
agency, Siskiyou County (SCH# 2016062056). The IWDP allows the Real Party in Interest,
Crystal Geyser Water Company ("Crystal Geyser") to discharge wastewater to the City's

9 wastewater collection and treatment system.

10 During the County's administrati ve review process of the Crystal Geyser operations and

11 the EIR, the City submitted comments objecting to various aspects of the project and the

12 wastewater sections of the EIR. The City determined that it would not challenge the EIR is

13 court, but maintained its objections raised in its comments on the Draft EIR, but the issues

14 raised by the City and others were never resolved by the County.

15 The validity of the EIR. has been challenged by the Petitioners in a separate case filed

16 against Siskiyou County, Siskiyou County Superior Court Case No. SCCVPT18-0041.

17 Petitioners will seek consolidation of the two actions upon filing this Petition.

18 The City, despite being : responsible agency, failed to make any formal findings in

19 compliance with CEQA Guidelines section 1509I.

20 Petitioners contend that Respondents' approvals for the Project violate the California

21 Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq. Petitioners

22 allege as follows:

PARTIES 23

24 1. Petitioner We Advocate Thorough Environmental Review ("WATER") is a

25 California non-profit corporation. WATER is a grass-roots organization established to a

26 promote quality local and regional planning, land use and development, as well as to preserve a

27 healthy human and natural environment in the Siskiyou County area. WATER and its

28 members have a direct and substantial beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondents comply
2 VERIFIED PEFITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

O0A0N L with the laws relating to zoning and environmental protection. Members of WATER live,
work and recreate in Siskiyou County and throughout the areas that will be impacted by the
Project. The interests of WATER will be harmed by the Project unless court action is taken
and Petitioners' requested relief is granted.

2. The Winnemem Wintu Tribe ("Tribe") is a Recognized Historic California Native
American Tribe, indigenous to northern California and formally recognized by the California
[ Native American Heritage Commission, an agency of the State of California with responsibility

8 for preserving and protecting Native American sites and cultural resources in California.

9 Winnemem Wintu translates to Middle Water People as the McCloud River is bounded by the

10 Upper Sacramento to the West and the Pit River to the East. The Tribe's traditional territory on

11 the south side of Mount Shasta encompasses springs and meadows that are included in the

12 National Register of Historic Places - Traditional Cultural Properties, which contribute to

13 Mount Shasta groundwater and the headwaters of the Sacramento River. The interests and

14 rights of the Tribe and its members will be harmed by the Project unless court action is taken

15 and Petitioners' requested relief is granted. The Tribe has thousands of years of history with the

16 land on which the Project site is located. The Tribe derives its identity from its relationship

17 with its historic physical/cultural landscape through continuing ceremony and prayer. The

18 Tribe's rights as Recognized Historic California Native American Tribe will be severely

19 injured and the Tribe's cultural values will not be considered when determining impacts and

20 mitigation, if the adoption of the Project is not set aside pending full compliance with CEQA

21 and all other laws.

22 3, Both WATER and the Tribe, and their members, have long-standing interests in

23 the area adjacent to the Project site, as well as in the surrounding community and County as a

24 whole. The Petitioners' environmental, aesthetic, cultural, traditional and property interests will

25 be severely injured if the adoption of the Project is not set aside pending full compliance with

26 CEQA and all other laws. Petitioners enjoy the County and State's natural resources.

27 Petitioners bring this petition on behalf of all others similarly situated who are too numerous to

28 be named and brought before this Court as petitioners. Petitioners are within the class of
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

persons and entities beneficially interested in, and aggrieved by, the acts of Respondents as
N 0 to alleged below. Petitioners participated in the administrative processes herein, with many
members submitting comment letters and objecting to the Project. Petitioners have exhausted
their remedies. Accordingly, Petitioners have standing to sue.

4. Respondent City of Mount Shasta is political subdivision of the State of California
and body corporate and politic exercising local government power. Mount Shasta is a CEQA
7 "Responsible Agency" for the Permit. As Responsible Agency, the City is responsible for
8 considering the final EIR prepared by the lead agency and reaching its own conclusions on

9 whetber and how to approve the project involved. (Guidelines § 15096.)'1 Before reaching a

10 decision, a responsible agency must consider the environmental effects identified in the EIR of

11 those activities that it is required to approve or carry out, and it must independently decide
12 whether to require additional environmental documentation. (Public Resources Code ["PRC*] §

13 21002.1(d); and Guidelines 15096(a) and (f).) The City must also adopt mitigation measures
designed to mitigate or avoid the direct or indirect environmental effects of those parts of the 14

15 Project that it decides to approve. (PRC § 21002.1; and Guidelines § 15096(g).) A responsible

16 agency must also make CEQA findings.

17 5. Respondent City of Mount Shasta City Council is a legislative body duly

18 authorized under the California Constitution and the laws of the State of California to act on

19 behalf of the City of Mount Shasta. Respondent City of Mount Shasta City Council is

20 responsible for regulating and controlling land use within the City including, but not limited to,
21 implementing and complying with the provisions of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, 14

22 California Code of Regulations, title 14, section 15000 et seq., applicable land use ordinances

23 and other laws. As the elected representatives of the people of the City, the City Council
24 establishes overall City priorities and sets policy. The City Council is the governing body of
25 the City and is ultimately responsible for reviewing and approving or denying the Permit.

26

27 1 The CEQA Guidelines are found at California Code of Regulations, title 14, section 15000 et seq., referred to herein as "Guidelines."

10 and 21 through 40, inclusive, and sue such unnamed Respondents and Real Parties in Interest

11 respectively, by their fictitious names. Petitioners are informed and believe, and based thereon

12 allege, that fictitiously named Respondents and Real Parties in Interest also are responsible for

13 all acts and omissions described above. When the true identities and capacities of Respondents

14 and Real Parties in Interest have been determined, Petitioners will, with leave of Court if

15 necessary, amend this Petition to include such identities and capacities.

16 8. IURISDICTION AND VENUE

17 This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to

18 Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, and Public Resources Code section 21168.5. In the

19 alternative, this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and

Public Resources Code section 21168.

20 9.

21 Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the State of California

22 in and for the County of Siskiyou pursuant to sections 393,394 and 395 of the Code of Civil

Procedure.

23

24 10. BACKGROUND FACTS

25 The Project site is located in Siskiyou County directly adjacent to the City of Mt.

26 Shasta city limits, on Ski Village Drive approximately 1,200 feet from the intersection with Mt.

27 Shasta Boulevard. The project site is comprised of fourteen parcels, Siskiyou County

28 ("County") Assessor's Parcel Numbers (APNs) 037- 060-030, -040, -050, -060; 037-070-060, -
070, -080, -090, -210; 037-140-020, -090; and, 037-160-010,- 020, -030, and is located in
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 5

Township 11 North, Range 4 West, Section 9 City of Mt. Shasta United States Geological
0 m t uo Survey (USGS) quadrangle. Regional access to the project site is provided by Interstate 5.
11. The Project site was used previously as a water bottling facility. Dannon Waters of
North American (prior to Dannon becoming Coca-Cola Dannon [CCDA Waters]) acquired the
property and a draft Initial Study was prepared in March 1998 to address potential environmentall
impacts and proposed mitigation measures for what is now the existing water bottling facility

7 that will be converted into a tea brewing and beverage bottling facility by Crystal Geyser

8 (*Plant"). A Mitigation Agreement was entered into in November 1998 between the County and

9 the then applicant which incorporated the mitigation measures identified in the 1998 draft Initial

10 Study ("1998 Agreement"). The Plant was subsequently constructed between 1998 through

11 2000 by CCDA Waters and began operation in January 2001. The Plant facilities consisted of

12 the plant building and ancillary structures.

13 12. In 2001, CCDA Waters sought and received approval from the Central Valley
Regional Water Quality Control Board for an on-site leach field for industrial waste process 14

15 rinse water. The leach field as constructed could accommodate 72,000 gallons per day.

16 13. CCDA Waters operated the Plant from approximately 2000 to 2010 and it has

17 been reported (without specific documentation) that the facility used a monthly average of

18 approximately 160 gallons per minute. It has also been reported by Plant neighbors that Plant

19 operations negatively impacted domestic wells in the area, as well as generating disturbing

20 noise and vibration.

21 14. In 2010, CCDA Waters' Plant was closed and the majority of equipment used for

22 the bottling operation was removed. Crystal Geyser purchased the project site in 2013.

23 15. The Project site is bound immediately to the north by residential housing and

24 industrial businesses, to the east by low density residential (LDR) housing, to the south by the

25 Mt. Shasta KOA campground along with a railroad line and single family housing, and to the

26 west by single family housing, as well as industrial and commercial businesses. Residential

27 land uses in the project vicinity consists of varying lot sizes, generally at a greater density

28 inside the City limits, and range from suburban to rural. Jehovah's Witnesses Kingdom Hall is
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 6

northwest of the site, approximately 375 feet from the automobile entrance to the Plant.
N m Commercial and industrial land uses in the vicinity generally occupy larger lots to support
automotive and trucking based businesses. Beyond the immediate project vicinity,
surrounding uses include residential and commercial uses in the City, rural residences in the
unincorporated county, and both public and private forestland.

16. The County's General Plan designates the Project site as Woodland Productivity
[ and Building Foundation Limitations: Severe Pressure Limitations Soils. The central project

8 site that contains the Plant and leach field is zoned M-H (Heavy Industrial), the northern

9 project site that contains the production well is zoned AG-2 (Non-Prime Agricultural), and the

10 eastern project site is zoned R-R-B-1 (Rural Residential Agricultural District).

11 17. On January 12, 2017, County issued a Draft EIR for the Project. Petitioners and

12 many others submitted extensive comments on the Draft EIR. The City also submitted

13 comments on the Draft EIR. County issued a Final EIR for the Project and scheduled a

14 Planning Commission hearing for September 20, 2017. The Planning Commission hearing

15 occurred on that date and was then continued to September 27, 2017. Petitioners and many

16 others submitted extensive comments on the Final EIR and during the Planning Commission

17 hearing.

18 18. On September 27, 2017, the Planning Commission approved the Project and

19 certified the EIR. Petitioners appealed the decision to the Board of Supervisors.

20 19. On November 16, 2017, the Board of Supervisors held a public bearing on the

21 appeal, heard presentations from Petitioners, Crystal Geyser and County staff, and heard public

22 testimony. The Board closed the hearing on November 16, 2017, and continued the item to

23 December 12, 2017, with a request to County staff to provide clarifications and answers to

24 questions raised at the public hearing.

25 20. On December 12,2017, the Board or Supervisors received the report from staff,

26 denied the appeal, approved the Project and certified the EIR.

27 21. On January 11, 2018, Petitioners filed a petition for writ of mandate against the

28 County (Case No. SCCVPT18-0041), seeking to have the approval of the Crystal Geyser
7 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

project and certification of the EIR set aside, alleging violations of CEQA and the applicable
N m tnngtco general plans.

22. The City first noticed a hearing a on the IWDP for February 5, 2018, then
postponed to February 26, 2018. After receiving comment letters, the City Manager informed
Petitioners that the matter was being continued due to requested changes from the applicant.
Thereafter, the matter was placed on the Agenda for the March 26, 2018 City Council meeting.
23. On March 26, 2018, the Permit was approved and the Resolution approving the
Permit noted that CEQA review had already be completed by the County. The City made no

9 formal CEQA Findings.
EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES 10
AND INADEQUACY OF REMEDY - 12 24. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant
13 action and have exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required

14 by law.

15 25. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code,

16 section 21167.5 by mailing written notice of this action to the Respondents. A copy of this

17 written notice and proof of service are attached as Exhibit A to this Petition for Writ of

18 Mandate.

26. Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.6 by

- 1- 19

20 concurrently filing request concerning preparation of the record of administrative

21 proceedings relating to this action.

22 27. Petitioners have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary

23 law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside

24 their approval of the Project and certification of the EIR. In the absence of such remedies,

25 Respondents' approval will remain in effect in violation of State law.

26 28. This action has been brought within 30 days of the filing of the Notice of
27 Determination as required by Public Resources Code section 21167(c).

STANDING

8 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- N m 71orpe 29. Petitioners have standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because
Petitioners' aesthetic, environmental and property interests are directly and adversely affected by
Respondents' certification of the EIR and approval of the Project. The Tribe also has standing
because the Tribe's rights and cultural interests as acknowledged and defined by AB52 are
directly and adversely affected by Respondents' certification of the EIR and approval of the
Project.
ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS ACTIONS

30. Petitioners bring this action on the basis, among others, of Government Code

9 section 800, and other applicable laws, which award Petitioners' attorneys' fees in actions to

10 overturn agency decisions that are arbitrary and capricious, such as the decisions here in

11 question.

12 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE

13 31. Petitioners bring this action as private attorneys general pursuant to Code

14 of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce

15 important rights affecting the public interest. Issuance of the relief requested in this

16 Petition will confer a significant benefit on a large class of persons by ensuring that

17 Respondent City does not approve the Project in the absence of lawful environmental

18 review and compliance with applicable local and state zoning law.

19 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

20 Abuse of Discretion

21 Violation of CEQA, Public Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.

22 32. Petitioners reallege and incorporate herein, as if set forth in full, each and every

23 allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 31.

24 33. In approving the Permit as described herein, Respondent City prejudicially abused

25 its discretion in violation of CEQA pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21168 and Code

26 of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, because the City relied upon an EIR that fails to include

27 information necessary for informed decision making and informed public participation,

28 including information necessary to reach informed conclusions regarding the significance of
9 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

N m 10N 0 the Project's environmental impacts, the effecti veness of mitigation measures to avoid the
Project's significant environmental impacts, or feasibility of mitigation measures to reduce the
Project's significant environmental impacts; because the EIR fails to lawfully assess the
Project's cumulative effects; because the EIR fails to use the best available information and/or
accepted methodology for analyzing information; because the Final EIR fails to provide good
faith responses to comments on the Draft EIR; because, with respect to the findings required by
CEQA, the City failed to make required findings, failed to support the findings with substantial
evidence, and failed to disclose the analytic route showing how the evidence supports the

9 findings.

10 34. The City failed to adopt feasible mitigation measures within its jurisdiction,

11 including the failure to require ongoing priority pollutant monitoring. While the permit

12 requires priority pollutant testing for a few months after the Plant starts up and after

13 introducing new products, there will be no regular, on-going testing. Priority pollutants could

14 also be introduced by changing cleaning solutions, changing boiler and/or cooling tower

15 chemicals. The City violated CEQA by not included on-going monitoring as a feasible a

16 mitigation measure.

17 35. The City also failed to adopt adequate mitigation measures with respect to the

18 potential discharge of hazardous effluent. The City deferred to Crystal Geyser to self-monitor

19 in relation to this issue as follows: "If any notification is made under this section, the permittee

20 must certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous

21 wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical." Thus, the City

22 leaves it to Crystal Geyser, and the discharge of hazardous effluent need not be mitigated at all

23 if it is not "economically practical." This mitigation effort is unenforceable and ineffective,

24 and fails to meet CEQA standards.

25 36. Petitioners allege that the City violated CEQA as detailed in comment letters

26 submitted by Petitioners and others during the administrative review process. The Petitioners

27 intend to prosecute all of the alleged violations of CEQA described herein and in the

28 documents submitted by Petitioners during the administrative review process.
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 10

auAw0- The Permit adds wastewater sources and omits constituents from the monitoring
list; items not considered in the EIR for the Crystal Geyser Project

37. The Permit revises the draft permit that was attached to the EIR as Appendix I,
and now includes: "condensate, boiler blowdown water, [and] cooling tower blowdown water."
The EIR did not analyze these wastewater streams, and the constituents that will be contained
in this wastew ater have not been disclosed to the public or the decision makers, nor have the
[ potential impacts of treatment of this wastewater been analyzed.

g 38. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that Crystal Geyser had

9 informed the City of its intention to seek the inclusion of additional waste streams long before

10 the completion of the Draft EIR by the County, and yet no action was taken by the City as a

11 responsible agency to include these known potential waste streams into the EIR's analysis.
12 39. The description of the "Project" being approved is confusing and unstable. The

13 Permit states that the permittee is authorized to discharge the condensate and "noncontact

14 cooling water" as requested, and refers to Part 7 for 7 further description of these waste streams.

15 Part 7 simply says that "condensate" is from an oil-free compressor and the "noncontact water

16 consists of boiler and cooling tower blowdown water." It goes on to say that Blowdown water

17 contains anti-scaling agents, various "Boilermate" products, but gives no indication of what

18 these agents contain.2 Cooling tower water is, by definition, not non-contact cooling water; it

19 might well become contaminated through the use of water treatment chemicals and/or anti-

20 scaling agents.

21 40. The condensate and blowdown water discharges require special authorization, and

22 there was nothing in the record before the City explaining what evidence would support the

23 City's approval of these discharges. The environmental document did not analyze the potential

24 impacts of these waste streams, and so the City was required to consider whether additional

25

26

27 2 The EIR for the Project mentioned the use of "Boilercare 1002" and it is unclear
whether or not this is the same or similar to the ingredients in Boilermate products.
28
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 11

- environmental analysis would be required. There was no support in the record for a
N071OD 00 discretionary decision to provide this special authorization.
II. The proposed Permit allows for necessary improvements to the
treatment system to be deferred until December of 2018

41. The Permit allows for significant delay in requiring the necessary improvements
to the City's wastewater system, and this will result in impacts to the environment. The City
failed to evaluate this impact and prepare supplemental CEQA documentation in order to
support its decision to approve the IWDP while at the same time allowing for the delay in

9 system improvements necessary for the Project.

10 42. With respect to the sufficiency of CEQA review, all of the shortcomings pointed

11 out by commenters during the County's review of the Project persist, and the impacts related to
12 wastewater treatment were not adequately reviewed or mitigated by the County as set forth in

13 the Petition for Writ of Mandate, Case No. SCCVPT18-0041. The City also commented

14 during the County's review process. And yet, despite the City's knowledge that the EIR was

15 potentially insufficient, the City conducted the barest of reviews during its consideration of the

16 IWDP, and did not even make formal CEQA findings. Approval of the IWDP without the

17 required independent judgment and findings violated CEQA.

18 IIL The EIR is faulty because the County failed to complete AB52 consultation with the

19 Winnemem Wintu Tribe

20 43. As a responsible agency, the City relied upon the EIR prepared by the County, but

21 failed to live up to the requirement that it exercise its independent judgment. The County's

22 failure to complete AB52 Consultation with the Tribe caused the BIR to fall short of CEQA'S

23 requirements. Accordingly, the EIR cannot support the City's approvals any more than it

24 could support the approval by the County.

25 44. The County staff reports for the November 16, 2017 and December 12, 2017

26 hearings state that the consultation process required upon request under AB 52 had been

27 completed. This is incorrect, and the County unilaterally terminated the consultation process

28 on September 6, 2017. The County suggested that the consultation process had been lengthy,
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 12

but this does not satisfy the termination requirements of the statute. The County did not find in

2 "good faith" that after "reasonable effort" agreement cannot be reached. (Public Resources
c Code § 21080.3.2 (b)(2).) The County's unilateral termination was based upon an improper
assertions that "the Proposed Project would not result in significant impacts on the TCRs that ~ c o w have been identified through the AB 52 consultation" and that the Tribe had not produced
substantial evidence to support its assertion that the Project would have potentially significant
impacts to Tribal Cultural Resources and that the County's timeline precluded further
consultation. This does not meet the standard of AB 52 and improperly characterizes the
9 obligations of the respective parties during consultation. The County was required by AB 52
10 to consult with the Tribe regarding the significance of Project impacts, and it did not do so.

11 There is no substantial evidence to support the claim that the County is in compliance with AB

12 52.

13 45. In addition to improper termination of the consultation, the deficiencies of the

14 Project description did not allow meaningful and comprehensive AB 52 consultation because

15 there is no upper limit on the volume of water that will be extracted by Crystal Geyser, and the

16 County asserts that it has no authority to limit the extraction amounts. The quantity of water

17 that is pumped out of the ground and the quality of water in the aquifer and in the Sacramento

18 River after the project releases its waste stream into its leach field and to the Mount Shasta

19 Wastewater Treatment Plant are the determining factors of whether the project adversely

20 impacts the Tribe's TCRs. Since there are no upper limits to extraction in the DEIR, the
21 analysis in Impacts 4.8-1 and 4.8-2 can never be sufficient. There is no way for the County or

22 the City to determine if the Project will have an adverse impact on the Tribe's groundwater

23 TCR. Only after the Project description is corrected will the Tribe and the County be able to
24 consult on the significance of adverse effects, mitigation measures and/or Project alternatives.

25 46. Further, the County's CEQA Findings state that no known tribal cultural

26 resources were identified in the Study Area. (CEQA Findings, p. 21.) This is simply

27 inaccurate, as such resources were identified and acknowledged by the County. There is no
28 substantial evidence to support this statement, the consultation with the Tribe was abruptly and
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 13

F improperly terminated by the County, and the "fact" contained in the County's CHQA Findings
N m t  0000 is incorrect.

47. During the initial stages of the AB 52 consultation process, the County
acknowledged the Tribal Cultural Resources identified by the Tribe, but the County failed to
consult with the Tribe regarding the significance of any adverse effects to these resources
because the County prematurely terminated the consultation process.

48. Because the Consultation process was not completed by the County as required by
law, the Final EIR is incomplete and violates the requirements of CEQA. Thus, it cannot

9 support the City's conclusions in its role as responsible agency.

10 IV. The Findings are not based upon substantial evidence

11 49. The City did not make formal CEQA Findings and the one-sentence statement in

12 the Resolution adopted to approve the IWDP was insufficient to be considered the "CEQA

13 Findings" for the City's approval.

14 50. The City, as a responsible agency, is required to consider the environmental

15 review document prepared by the lead agency and make findings regarding the environmental

16 effects of those parts of the Project that the City decides to carry out, fund or approve.

17 51. Responsible Agency must make one or more of three findings pursuant to CEQA

18 Guidelines section 15091(a).

19 Changes have been incorporated in the project to avoid or substantially

20 lessen the identified significant environmental effect.
The changes are within the jurisdiction of another agency and the changes
88 have been or should be adopted by that other agency.
Specific considerations which make infeasible the alternatives identified in
24 the final EIR.

25 Support finding by substantial evidence in the record.

26 Agency must present an explanation of the rational of each finding.

27 52. The City did not make any findings outside of a short statement in the resolution

28 approving the Permit as follows: "WHEREAS; The City Council has considered the
14 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

n Environmental Impact Report prepared by the County of Siskiyou for the Crystal Geyser

NaUAw Bottling Plant and finds no unmitigated adverse environmental impacts relating to the alternate
waste discharge disposal methods."

53. Findings must supply a logical step between the ultimate finding and the facts in

the record. When choice is made among alternatives, as was done here by the City, findings
must reveal the agency's reasons for reaching such a conclusion. Conclusory statements alone

co will not suffice. The City failed to provide anything beyond one conclusory statement.
54.

9 As a result of Respondents' failure to comply with the procedures required by

10 CEQA and the CBQA Guidelines, a preemptory writ of mandate must issue ordering

11 Respondents to set aside its environmental conclusions and the related decision, and directing

12 Respondents to comply with the procedures mandated by CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines.

14 Wherefore, Petitioners respectfully request the following relief and entry of judgment as

20 CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, and to take any other action required by Public Resources Code
section 21168.9 or as otherwise required by law;

21 3.

22 For a stay and preliminary and permanent injunction restraining City and its

23 agents, employees, officers and representatives from undertaking any activity to implement the

24 Project in any way pending full compliance with CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines;

4

25 For a declaration that Respondents' actions in approving the Project violated

CEQA as set forth above;

26 5.

27 For Petitioners' attorneys' fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 and
other applicable authority;

28 6. Costs of suit; and
