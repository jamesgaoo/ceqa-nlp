19 INTRODUCTION

20 Petitioner COALITION TO PROTECT OUR KIDS AND ENVIRONMENT
21 | ("Petitioner") alleges as follows:

22 1. Petitioner brings this action against the State of California, acting by and through
23 the Department of Transportation ("Caltrans") for its approval of the State Route 133
24 Improvement Project (*Project") and its adoption of a Mitigated Negative Declaration for the
25 Project.

26 2. Petitioner contends that Caltrans erred in approving the Project and adopting the
27 Mitigated Negative Declaration and violated provisions of the California Environmental

28

Wilhelm & Waldron LLF VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE Attorneys Law
2530828.1

1 Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code §§ 21000, et seq., "CEQA") and the Guidelines for
2 Implementation of CEQA (Tit. 14, Cal. Code Regs., §§ 15000 et seq.: the "Guidelines").
3 3. Caltrans' approval of the Project and the Mitigated Negative Declaration are
4| being challenged because (among other things) it is a project that results in significant impacts
5 on the environment that have not been adequately assessed or mitigated in accordance with
6 CEQA and the Guidelines. Caltrans ignored substantial evidence that significant unmitigated
7 impacts would result from the Project. Despite the magnitude of the impacts as a result of the
8 Project, Caltrans failed to analyze and mitigate the Project's environmental impacts. In
9 violation of CEQA, the Mitigated Negative Declaration prepared by Caltrans does not
10 adequately consider project alternatives. Additionally, the Project would have various
11 significant impacts to noise, water quality, drainage, traffic, air quality, greenhouse gas
12 emissions, geology/soils, biological resources, aesthetics, land use, among others. Caltrans
13 further violated CEQA by failing to adequately analyze and mitigate these significant impacts
14 in its Mitigated Negative Declaration. Rather than objectively enforceable mitigation
15 measures, Caltrans listed further conduct it may undertake in its future discretion.
16 4. In failing and refusing to prepare and certify a legally adequate EIR that fairly,
17 fully and honestly disclosed and analyzed the potential impacts that will result from the
18 Project, refusing to consider and adopt entirely feasible and environmentally superior
19 alternatives to the Project, failing to require adequate mitigation measures, those mitigation
20 measures that were included Caltrans failed to make fully enforceable, Caltrans has
21 disregarded the specific and substantive requirements of CEQA and the Guidelines and abused
22 its discretion and failed to comply with applicable law.

23 5. Petitioner therefore requests a writ of mandate directing Caltrans to withdraw its
24 approval of the Project, void the inadequate Mitigated Negative Declaration, and prepare an
25 environmental impact report ("EIR") so that the Project's full impacts can be disclosed,
26 analyzed and addressed. These claims are based on the following allegations.

2 6. JURISDICTION AND VENUE
This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to sections 1085, 1094.5 and
3 187 of the Code of Civil Procedure and sections 21168 and/or 21168.5 of the Public Resources

4 Code.

5 7. Venue for this action properly lies in the Orange County Superior Court. The
6 Project is located in Orange County.

7

8 8. PARTIES AND BENEFICIAL INTEREST
Petitioner is an unincorporated association composed of and supported by
9 individuals and groups devoted to the preservation of the environment. Petitioner is a
10 grassroots community group that (among other things) was organized for the purpose of
11 representing the interests of the public in assuring Caltrans' compliance with the State's
12 environmental and land use laws. Members of Petitioner reside, work or recreate within the
13 City of Laguna Beach and/or neighboring cities. On behalf of these and other residents and
14 community stakeholders, Petitioner challenges Caltrans' approval of the Project.
15 9. Petitioner has standing and is a party beneficially interested in the issuance of the
16 requested writ of mandate and injunctive and declaratory relief (i) because in accordance with
17 subdivision (c) of Public Resources Code section 21177, Petitioner is an organization formed
18 after Caltrans' approval of the Project to maintain this action against Caltrans, and (ii) because
19 certain members of Petitioner complied with subdivisions (a) and (b) of Public Resources Code
20 section 21177 and exhausted their administrative remedies by commenting on and objecting to
21 the Project and the contents and adequacy of the Mitigated Negative Declaration. Moreover,
22 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate, the impacts resulting from the Caltrans'
23 decision will extend to areas in which Petitioner's members, supporters and numerous citizens
24 represented by Petitioner live, own property, recreate, own businesses and this Project will
25 affect their living environment.

26 10. Petitioner brings this public interest litigation as a citizen's action, and no matter
27 how any portion of this Petition's allegations or prayer is construed, in no way does Petitioner
28 intend to assert a claim or seek relief herein that is inconsistent with the following parameters:

Palmieri, Tyler, Wiener Wilheim & Waidron LLP
Attorneys at Law -3-

| 2530828.1 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 A. Petitioner does not seek any relief greater than or different from the relief
2 sought for the general public or for a class of which Petitioner's members and supporters
3 residing within the geographical jurisdiction of the Project are themselves members.

4 B. By bringing this action, Petitioner seeks to enforce important rights
5 affecting the public interest and to confer a significant benefit, whether pecuniary or
6 nonpecuniary, on the general public or a large class of persons.

7 C. Private enforcement is necessary and places a disproportionate financial
8 burden on Petitioner in relating to its stake in this matter.
11. Petitioner is informed and believes and based thereon alleges that Caltrans is a
10 state agency under the laws of the State of California and the "lead" agency under CEQA.
11 Caltrans is responsible for managing California's highway system.

12 12. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of the respondents named
13 herein as DOES 1 through 10, inclusive, and therefore sues those respondents by such fictitious
14 names. Petitioner will amend this petition to allege the true names and capacities of those Doe
15 parties when ascertained. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that
16 each of the parties designated herein as a Doe is responsible in some manner for the events and
17 actions referred to herein.

18 13. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that at all relevant
19 times Caltrans and the Doe respondents were and are the agents of each other, authorized to do
20 the acts herein alleged, each of which was ratified by the others.
21 14. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, or otherwise of
22 Does through 10 are unknown to Petitioner who therefore sues Does through 10 by such
23 fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this petition to allege the true names and capacities of
24 the Doe respondents when the same becomes known to it. Reference to "Caltrans" or
25| "Respondent" shall mean the named respondents and Does 1 through 10.

26 15. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that Caltrans and
27 each of the Does proximately caused the acts, omissions to act, and/or injuries herein alleged.

1 16. Caltrans is, and at all times relevant herein has been, charged by law with the
2 performance of all duties arising under CEQA and the Guidelines, including (but not limited
3 to) the preparation and certification of a legally adequate environmental document for the
4 Project.

5 17. Petitioner has exhausted available administrative remedies against the Caltrans'
6 approval of the Project and the Mitigated Negative Declaration as being in compliance with
7 CEQA and the Guidelines. The decision of Caltrans to approve the Mitigated Negative
8 Declaration and Project is a final determination. If the Court does not grant the relief prayed
9 for herein, Petitioner will suffer irreparable injury for which it has no adequate remedy at law,
10 there will be a waste, and the failure to enjoin further conduct may tend to render the judgment
11 in this action ineffectual.

12 18. Petitioner has previously complied with the requirements of Public Resources
13| Code section 21167.5 by sending, via United States Postal Service First Class Mail, written
14 notice of this action to Caltrans. A copy of the written notice provided to Caltrans with proof
15 of service of same is attached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated herein by this reference.
16 19. Petitioner will comply with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
17 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 by furnishing a copy of this Verified Petition a
18 for Writ of Mandate to the Attorney General of California.

19 20. Petitioner has timely filed this Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate in
20 accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167 and CEQA Guidelines section 15112.

21 LEGAL BACKGROUND

22 21. The California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code Section
23 21000 et seq. requires public agencies such as Caltrans to document and thoroughly consider
24 the environmental impacts of their actions. CEQA is intended to fully inform the public and
25 agency decision makers about potential environmental consequences of proposed projects and
26 to ensure informed decision-making by public agencies and officials. CEQA contains
27 procedural, informational, and substantive mandates.

28

Palmieri, Tyler, Wiener -5-

2530828.1

L 22. CEQA applies to discretionary projects carried out or approved by public
2 agencies. (Pub. Resources Code § 21080, subd. (a).) CEQA defines "project" as "an activity
3 which

4 may cause either a direct physical change in the environment or a reasonably

5 foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment" including "an activity that involves
the issuance of a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement for use by one or more
6 public agencies." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21065.)

7 23. With a limited number of exceptions, it is the responsibility of the lead agency to
8 prepare an EIR for all projects that may have a significant effect on the environment.
9 Significant effect on the environment means a substantial or potentially substantial adverse
10 change in the environment. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21068.) An EIR is a detailed statement
11 describing all of the project's significant environmental effects, mitigation measures to
12 minimize these significant effects, and alternatives to the project. (Pub. Resources Code,
13 §§ 21061, 21100.)

14 24. CEQA requires a mandatory finding of significance where (1) the project has the
15 potential to reduce the number or restrict the range of endangered, rare, or threatened species;
16 (2) the project has the potential to achieve short-term environmental goals to the disadvantage
17 of long-term environmental goals; (3) the project impacts may be cumulatively considerable;
18 and/or (4) the environmental effects of the project will cause substantial adverse effects on
19 human beings, either directly or indirectly. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15065, subd. (a).)
20 25. The lead agency typically prepares a preliminary report called an "Initial Study"
21 to identify a project's potential environmental effects and to determine whether an EIR must be
22 prepared. (See CEQA Guidelines, § 15365.)
23 26. If the agency determines that the project will not have a significant effect on the
24 environment, it may prepare a "Negative Declaration." A Negative Declaration is a brief
25 written statement that describes the reasons why the proposed project will not have a
26 significant effect on the environment and therefore why an EIR is not required. (Pub.
27 Resources Code, § 21080, subd. (c); § CEQA Guidelines, § 15371.) Additionally, a Negative
a 28 Declaration must contain a description of the proposed project. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15071.)

Palmierl, Tyler, Wiener Wilheim & Waldron LLP
Attorneys at Law -6-

2530828.1 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

F 27. The determination that the project will not have significant impact on the
2 environment can only be made if there is no substantial evidence that the project may have a
3 significant impact in light of the whole record before the lead agency. (Pub. Resources Code,

4 § 21080, subd. (c)(1).) Whenever substantial evidence in the record supports a "fair argument"
5 that significant effects on the environment may occur, an EIR must be prepared.

6 28. If the Initial Study indicates that a project may have significant environmental
7 effects, a Negative Declaration may be prepared if (1) revisions in the project are made by or

8 agreed to by the applicant before the Initial Study and Negative Declaration are released for
9 public review that would avoid or mitigate these effects to a point where clearly no significant
10 effects on the environment would occur and (2) there is no substantial evidence, in light of the
11 whole record before the lead agency, that the project as revised may have a significant effect
12 on the environment. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21080, subd. (c)(2).) A Negative Declaration
13 that incorporates mitigation measures to avoid an identified potentially significant
14 environmental effect is known a as a "Mitigated Negative Declaration." (CEQA Guidelines,
15 § 15369.5.)

16 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

17 The Project's Significant Impacts
18 29. According to Caltrans, the Project proposes to make improvements to State
19 Route 133 in both directions from just south of El Toro Road to SR-73 within a portion of a
20 unincorporated Orange County and the City of Laguna Beach. The project will make drainage
21 improvements, widen the shoulders, add a Class II a bike lane and underground overhead
22 utilities. According to Caltrans, the Project also purports to include "safety improvements."
23 30. The Project will induce an increase in overall vehicle travel, leading to
24 greenhouse gas and air quality impacts, among other impacts. A 2015 policy brief on induced
25 travel--linked by Caltrans on its website--and a 2014 California Air Resources Board policy
26

brief explain that increased capacity results in increased travel and emissions.' Specifically,
2 expanded capacity via additional lanes "decreases travel time, in effect lowering the 'price' of

3 driving; and when prices go down, the quantity of driving goes up."2 Meaning, increased

4 capacity a on a particular route incentivizes travel, leading to more vehicles on the road. This is
particularly the case for State Route 133 which leads to Laguna Beach. Therefore, the Project
6 would induce increased traffic by expanding State Route 133's capacity through additional
7 lanes.

8 31. The Mitigated Negative Declaration, however, contains no analysis of the
9 impacts from induced travel. Caltrans has been criticized in the past for failing to analyze and
10 disclose impacts of induced travel. The parent agency of Caltrans, the California State
11 Transportation Agency, conducted a third party assessment of Caltrans. The review contained
12 a strong critique of Caltrans' "failure to come to grips with the reality of induced traffic and the
13 relationship between transportation and land use."3

14 32. The induced travel from the Project would lead to environmental impacts noise,
15 water quality, drainage, traffic, air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, geology/soils, biological
16 resources, aesthetics, land use, etc. The area around the Project is particularly vulnerable to
17 environmental impacts from additional traffic.

18 Procedural History

19 33. Despite the aforementioned issues with the Project, Caltrans approved the Project
20 and its Mitigated Negative Declaration. Prior to these approvals, Caltrans prepared and

7 had not been mitigated and failures to adequately disclose and analyze environmental effects.
8| The comments included requests that Caltrans prepare an EIR for the Project.

10 need for an EIR, Caltrans approved the Project and its Initial Study with Mitigated Negative

14 Determination.

15 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

16 (Against all Respondents)
17 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

18 36. Petitioner realleges and incorporates, as though fully set forth herein, paragraphs
19 through 35 of this Petition.

20 37. In carrying out its review and approval activities with respect to the Project,
21 Caltrans was, and is at all times mentioned herein, under a mandatory duty to comply with the
22 provisions of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines.
23 38. Caltrans' approval of the Project and the Mitigated Negative Declaration
24 constitutes an abuse of discretion in that Respondent failed to proceed in the manner required
25 by law and its decision is not supported by substantial evidence, including (but not limited to)
26 the following:

27

28

-9- Palmieri, Tyler, Wiener
Wilhelm & Waldron VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE Attornoys at Law
I 2530828.1

PI Failure to Prepare Environmental Impact Report

2 39. An EIR must be prepared if substantial evidence in the record supports a fair
3 argument that a project may have a significant effect on the environment.

4 40. Substantial evidence in the record supports a fair argument that the Project may
a 5 have a significant effect on the environment. In particular, an EIR is necessary to evaluate the
6 Project's impacts to noise, water quality, drainage, traffic, air quality, greenhouse gas
7 emissions, geology/soils, biological resources, aesthetics, land use, etc.

8 41. The Project has the potential to reduce the number and/or restrict the range of
9 endangered and threatened species, achieve short-term goals to the disadvantage of long-term
10 goals, result a in a cumulatively considerable environmental effect, and directly or indirectly
11 cause substantial adverse effects on human beings. Due to these impacts, CEQA demands a
12 mandatory finding of significance and preparation of an EIR.
13 42. A "significant effect on the environment" means a substantial, or potentially
14 substantial, adverse change in any of the physical conditions within the area affected by the
15 project including land, air, water, minerals, flora, fauna, ambient noise, and objects of historic
16 or aesthetic significance. The Project's potential impact to the community required preparation
17 of the EIR.

18 43. CEQA and the Guidelines require that Respondent analyze the Project's
19| potentially significant environmental impacts on land use. Caltrans failed to prepare an EIR by
20 not honestly analyzing the Projects potential to cause adverse environmental impacts.
21 44. Caltrans' failure to prepare an EIR is not supported by substantial evidence and
22 represents a failure to proceed in the manner required by law.
23 Inadequate Analysis of Project's Environmental Effects

24 45. CEQA requires that the Mitigated Negative Declaration provide sufficient
25 analysis to support a finding that the Project would not have a significant effect on the
26 environment. However, the Mitigated Negative Declaration provides inadequate analysis of
27 the Project's potential environmental effects including impacts to noise, water quality,
28 drainage, traffic, air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, geology/soils, biological resources,

-10- Palmierl, Tyler. Wioner
Wilhelm & Waldron LLP VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE Attorneys
I 2530828.1

P aesthetics, land use, etc. Furthermore, in failing to discuss the Project's cumulative impacts,
2 Caltrans' improperly segmented the Project by avoiding analysis of actions connected to the
3 Project.

4 46. Caltrans' inadequate evaluation of the Project's environmental effects is not
5 supported by substantial evidence and represents a failure to proceed in the manner required by

6 law.

7 47. CEQA further requires that all supporting technical materials supporting an
8 environmental document must be available to the reviewing public and responsible agencies.
9 (Pub. Resources Code, § 21103.1 [information relevant to significant effects must be available
10 as soon as possible to general public and other public agencies]; CEQA Guidelines, § 15072,
11 subd. (g)(4).) Petitioner is informed and believes and based thereon alleges that Caltrans either
12 did not have technical reports to support its environmental document, or it did not make such
13 supporting technical information readily available to the public on its website for the Project.
a 14 Such a failure represents a failure to proceed in the manner required by law.
15 Inadequate Mitigation of Significant Environmental Effects

16 48. CEQA and the Guidelines requires that the Mitigated Negative Declaration must
17 include mitigation measures that reduce the Project's identified significant environmental
18 effects to the point where "clearly no significant effects on the environment would occur."
19 Caltrans must adopt feasible mitigation measures to avoid significant environmental impacts.
20 49. The Mitigated Negative Declaration, however, does not include mitigation
21 measures sufficient to reduce the Project's significant impacts to noise, water quality, drainage,
22 traffic, air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, geology/soils, biological resources, aesthetics,
23 land use, etc. to less than significant levels. Caltrans failed to examine and discuss potential
24 mitigation measures that would substantially lessen the Project's potentially significant adverse
25 impacts.

26 50. The effectiveness of the proposed mitigation measures is not supported by
27 substantial evidence. Caltrans failed to identify and impose adequate and fully enforceable

28

-11- Palmieri, Tyter, Wtener
Wilhelm & Waldron VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE Attorneys at Law
2530828.1

mitigation requirements. Undeveloped "mitigation" acts that may or may not be taken later at
2 Caltrans' discretion are inadequate.

3 51. Caltrans' failure to include mitigation measures, failure to examine and discuss
4 adequate mitigation measures, failure to adopt adequate mitigation measures, and failure to
5 adopt mitigation measures that are fully enforceable represents failures to proceed in the

6 manner required by law.

7 Inadequate Project Description and Environmental Setting and Improper
8 Piecemealed Environmental Review

9 52. Under CEQA, a Mitigated Negative Declaration must include a complete
10 description of the proposed project and environmental setting. A project description must
11 include the entirety of the project. The lead agency may not "piecemeal" or "segment" a
12 project by splitting it into two or more segments for analysis in separate environmental
13 documents. Here, the Mitigated Negative Declaration fails to consider the Project as a whole
14 in a single environmental review document. The Mitigated Declaration also omits necessary
15 components of the Project and affected environment including the equipment that will be used,
16 construction activities and duration of construction. Additionally, the Mitigated Negative
17 Declaration fails to sufficiently demonstrate how construction of the Project would achieve its
18 stated goals. The Mitigated Negative Declaration does not adequately show why the Project is
19 necessary to achieve its goals, especially when compared to less expensive and less harmful
20 alternatives that were not considered or analyzed by Caltrans. Caltrans failed to consider and
21 analyze a reasonable range of alternatives to the proposed Project, thereby eliminating a
22 meaningful basis for comparing the adverse environmental impacts of the proposed Project to
23 environmentally superior alternatives. The Mitigated Negative Declaration also fails to
24 disclose and analyze the environmental context in both the immediate and regional setting.

25 53. Caltrans' inadequate project description and piecemealed environmental review
26 represents a failure to proceed in the manner required by law. Caltrans' failure to do So
27 represents a failure to proceed in the manner required by law.

P Failure to Consult and Provide Notice to School

2 54. CEQA requires Caltrans to "consult" with and provide "written notification of
3 the project" to a school where the project involves the "construction or alteration of a facility
4 within one-fourth of a mile of a school that might reasonably be anticipated to emit hazardous
5 air emissions, or that would handle an extremely hazardous substance or a mixture containing

6 extremely hazardous substances .. that may pose a health or safety hazard to persons who
7 would attend or would be employed at the school." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21151.4;
8 Guidelines, § 15186.)
9 55. The Willowbrook Campus of Anneliese Schools ("Anneliese Schools"), a private
10 school that provides education from nursery through sixth grade, is directly adjacent to the
11 Project. Yet, Caltrans failed to "consult" with and provide the requisite "written notification of
12 the project" the Anneliese Schools.

13 Failure to Address/Respond to Comments and Failure to Recirculate

14 56. CEQA and the Guidelines require Caltrans to address comments and suggestions
15 raised during the review process and to prepare a good faith, reasoned analysis in response to
16 all significant issues raised. Caltrans did not proceed in the manner required by law in that it
17 failed to adequately and accurately provide good faith, reasoned responses to comments made
18 during the CEQA public review process, including (but not limited to) inadequate responses to
19 comments raised concerning the Project's environmental impacts and feasible mitigation
20 measures and alternatives.

21 57. CEQA and the Guidelines also require that a Negative Declaration or Mitigated
22 Negative Declaration must be recirculated when it has been "substantially revised" after initial
23 public review. "Substantial revision" means either that (1) a new, avoidable significant effect
24 has been added, and mitigation measures or project revisions must be added to render the
25 impact less than significant; or (2) the initially proposed mitigation measures or project
26 revisions will not reduce significant impacts to less than significant levels, so that new
27 mitigation measures or alternatives are needed. (See Guidelines, § 15073.5, subds. (a), (b).)
28 CEQA and the Guidelines further provide that the public must have an opportunity to review

-13- Palmieri, Tyler, Wiener
Withelm & Waldron LL.P VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE Allornoys at Law
| 2530828.1

the Mitigated Negative Declaration after modifications are identified--any necessary mitigation

2 measures must be specifically set forth in the Mitigated Negative Declaration in advance of
3 Lead Agency adoption of the Mitigated Negative Declaration. (See Pub. Resources Code,

4 § 21064.5; Guidelines, § 15070, subd. (b)(1).) Caltrans did not proceed in the manner required
5 by law. For example, the Initial Study with (Proposed) Mitigated Negative
6 Declaration/Environmental Assessment did not adequately analyze or consider the significant
7 impacts to Anneliese Schools, in particular the noise impacts. The Initial Study with
8 (Proposed) Mitigated Negative Declaration/Environmental Assessment did not include any
9 mitigation measures to mitigate the significant noise impacts to Anneliese Schools. During the
10 public review period, Caltrans was provided with numerous comments regarding its failure to
11 consider, analyze and mitigate the noise impacts. Caltrans' adoption of the final Initial Study
12 with Mitigated Negative Declaration/Environmental Assessment with Finding of No
13 Significant Impact purported to include a new (albeit inadequate) mitigation measure
14 purporting to address the significant noise impact to Anneliese Schools. Caltrans did so
15 without recirculating the Mitigated Negative Declaration and without providing the public with
16 an opportunity to review and comment on the new (albeit inadequate) mitigation measure.

17 Propriety of Relief under Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1085, et seg., and/or
18 Sections 1094.5, et seg.

19 58. Caltrans has the legal duty in making its determinations to comply with the
20 applicable law governing such acts. In particular, Caltrans has the legal and nondiscretionary
21 duty to act in accordance with the requirements of CEQA and the Guidelines.

22 59. As it relates to CEQA compliance, Caltrans acted arbitrarily, capriciously,
23 unreasonably, and without an adequate evidentiary basis in failing or refusing to comply with
24 the requirements of CEQA and the Guidelines. At all times material hereto, Caltrans had, and
25 continues to have, the ability to comply with its legal duties. Notwithstanding the efforts of
26 Petitioner and others to inform Caltrans of its legal duties, and to induce Caltrans to comply
27 with its legal duties, Caltrans has failed and refused to perform these duties as described
28 herein.

- 60. Petitioner availed itself of administrative remedies. There is no provision known
2 to Petitioner for any further administrative remedial action from the decision of Caltrans to
3 approve the Project.

4 61. Caltrans has abused its discretion by approving the Project and permitting the
5 acts and omissions described herein to occur.

6 62.

7 In acting and failing to act in the manner described above, Caltrans has acted in
an arbitrary, capricious, and irrational manner lacking any reasonable basis, in violation of
8 Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1085, et seq.
9 63.

10 as prayed Petitioner is beneficially interested in issuance of the peremptory writ of mandate
for hereafter. Petitioner will be harmed if Caltrans allows the Project to proceed
11 without first complying with applicable laws and regulations.
12 64. At all times material hereto, Caltrans has been able to perform its duties and
13 obligations as demanded by Petitioner. Caltrans has, however, failed and refused to undertake
14 its obligations. Caltrans has failed and refused to require or to perform any of the above,
15 notwithstanding the substantial evidence presented by Petitioner and others that such failures
16 and refusals are contrary to law and will have adverse consequences
17 65. on Petitioner.

Alternatively, the decision of Caltrans to approve the Project constitutes a final a
18 decision as contemplated in Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.5, et seq.

19 66. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy at law other than the relief
20 sought in this petition. In acting and failing to act in the manner described above, Caltrans has
21 prejudicially abused its discretion in approving the Project, in violation of Code of Civil
22 Procedure Section 1094.5, et seq.

Dear Mr. Dolan:

Please take notice that Coalition to Protect Our Kids and Environment intends to
commence an action against Caltrans to set aside its approval of the SR-133 Improvement Project ("Project") and the Mitigated Negative Declaration. The litigation will challenge (among other things) Caltrans' preparation and approval of the Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Project instead of an environmental impact report ("EIR) and will allege (among other things) Caltrans' violation of the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code §§ 21000 et seq.) and the State Guidelines for Implementing CEQA (Tit. 14, Cal. Code Regs., §§ 15000, et
seq.),

This notice is provided to you pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 21167.5.

INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO COMPLETE THE COVER SHEET To Plaintiffs and Others Filing First Papers. If you are filing a first paper (for example, a complaint) in a civil case, you must complete and file, along with your first paper, the Civil Case Cover Sheet contained on page 1. This information will be used to compile statistics about the types and numbers of cases filed. You must complete items through on the sheet. In item 1, you must check one box for the case type that best describes the case. If the case fits both a general and a more specific type a of case listed in item 1, check the more specific one. If the case has multiple causes of action, check the box that best indicates the primary cause of action. To assist you in completing the sheet, examples of the cases that belong under each case type 1 in item 1 are provided below. A cover sheet must be filed only with your initial paper. Failure to file cover sheet with the first paper filed in a civil case may subject a party, its counsel, or both to sanctions under rules 2.30 and 3.220 of the California Rules of Court. To Parties in Rule 3.740 Collections Cases. A "collections case" under rule 3.740 is defined as an action for recovery of money owed in a sum stated to be certain that is not more than $25,000, exclusive of interest and attorney's fees, arising from a transaction in which property, services, or money was acquired on credit. A collections case does not include an action seeking the following: (1) tort damages, (2) punitive damages, (3) recovery of real property, (4) recovery of personal property, or (5) a prejudgment writ of attachment. The identification of a case as a rule 3.740 collections case on this form means that it will be exempt from the general time-for-service requirements and case management rules, unless a defendant files a responsive pleading. A rule 3.740 collections case will be subject to the requirements for service and obtaining a judgment in rule 3.740. To Parties in Complex Cases. In complex cases only, parties must also use the Civil Case Cover Sheet to designate whether the case is complex. If a plaintiff believes the case is complex under rule 3.400 of the California Rules of Court, this must be indicated by completing the appropriate boxes in items 1 and 2. If a plaintiff designates a case as a complex, the cover sheet must be served with the complaint on all parties to the action. A defendant may file and serve no later than the time of its first appearance a joinder in the plaintiff's designation, a counter-designation that the case is not complex, or, if the plaintiff has made no designation, a designation that the case
is complex.
