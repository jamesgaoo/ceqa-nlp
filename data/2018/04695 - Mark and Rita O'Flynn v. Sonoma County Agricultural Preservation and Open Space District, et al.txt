20 PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under Public Resources Code §21167.7 and Code of Civil
21

22 Procedure §388, that on October 19, 2018 Mark and Rita O'Flynn filed a petition for writ of mandate

23 against Sonoma County Agricultural Preservation and Open Space District ("SCAPOSD") in Sonoma

24 County Superior Court. The petition alleges that Sonoma County Agricultural Preservation and Open

25 Space District violated the California Environmental Quality Act regarding the River Lane Matching

26 Grant Project by passing the following resolutions:
27

28 1. Determining that the Project is consistent with the Sonoma County General Plan 2020 and
the Sonoma County Agricultural Preservation and Open Space District's Expenditure Plan;

Notice to Attorney General

1 2. Authorizing execution of a Matching Grant Agreement with the Russian River Recreation and
Parks District, pursuant to which a $35,000 grant will be made to the Russian River 2 Recreation and Parks District for the Project;
3 3. Authorizing execution and acceptance of a Conservation Easement and Recreation
Covenant;
4 4. Dedicating the conservation easement to open space purposes pursuant to Public Resources
5 Code Section 5540; and
5. Directing the filing of a Notice of Exemption under the California Environmental Quality Act
6 for the acquisition of the conservation easement pursuant to Title 14 of the California Code

7 of Regulations Sections 15378, 15317, and 15325(a) and (f).

8
SCAPOSD did thereafter cause a Notice of Exemption to filed with the Sonoma County
9

10 Clerk. Said notice failed to identify the real party in interest, Russian River Recreation and Park

11 District ("RRRPD"). RRRPD intends on creating a public beach with no rest room facilities. This

12 project will have significant environmental effects and without meeting CEQA requirements will

13 irreparably harm the environment and directly impact the water quality of the Russian River.
14
SCAPOSD's actions constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion by failing to proceed in the manner
15

16 required by law.

17 A copy of the petition is attached to this notice.

Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 4. The project consists of: the authorization of a matching grant in the amount of $35,000

2 from respondent SCAPOSD to real party in interest RRRPD to acquire a parcel of land sited at 17488

3 River Lane in Guerneville; authorizing the execution and acceptance of a conservation easement and
4
recreational covenant; dedicating the conservation easement to open space purposes pursuant to 5

6 Public Resources Code §5540; and the filing of a Notice of Categorical Exemption pursuant to §§

7 15378, 15317, 15325 title 14 a of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA").

8 5. The parcel of land being acquired was formerly developed as pumping station by its

9 current owner, Sweetwater Springs Water District, and is not in a natural condition nor does it
10
contain historical or archaeological resources. 11

12 6. The project is an activity subject to CEQA under Pub Res C §21080(a).

13 7. Respondent SCAPOSD caused a Notice of Categorical Exemption ("Notice") for the

14 project to be filed on September 14, 2018 with the Sonoma County Clerk. The Notice is statutorily
15 deficient wherein it does not name real party in interest RRRPD as required by Pub Res C $21152.
16 (The Notice is attached as Exhibit A.)
17

18 8. Respondent SCAPOSD did not provide public notice or an opportunity for public

19 comment by virtue of filing said Notice.

20 9. Petitioners O'Flynns performed all conditions precedent to filing this action by complying
21 with the requirements of Public Resources Code §21167.5 in filing notice of this action on October
22

23 19, 2018, including mailing a Notice of Intent to File CEQA Action to respondent SCAPOSD and

24 real party in interest RRRPD. (See Exhibit B.)

25 10. Respondent SCAPOSD and real party in interest RRRPD are planning on proceeding

26 with this project in the near future. Proceeding with this project will have significant environmental

27 effects and without meeting CEQA requirements will irreparably harm the environment by creating a
28

Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 public beach with no restroom facilities and directly impact the water quality of the Russian River. A

2 temporary restraining order and preliminary injunctions should issue restraining respondent

3 SCAPOSD and real party in interest RRRPD from proceeding with the project until CEQA
4
requirements have been complied with.
5

6 11. Respondent SCAPOSD's actions in filing the Notice constitute a prejudicial abuse of

7 discretion by failing to proceed in the manner required by law. The filing of the Notice is not

8 supported by substantial evidence as follows:

9 a. Respondent SCAPOSD has not considered the project's impact of providing access to a beach
10

11 without restroom facilities by more than 50 people and their pets on a regular daily basis.

12 b. Respondent SCAPOSD has not considered the project's situs within a Biotic Habitat Area

13 which is sensitive to change and the adverse effects of human activities such as destroying

14 vegetative cover which helps reduce surface runoff and increases recharge, increases erosion
15 and degrades stream channels, and degrades water quality.
16
C.
17 Respondent SCAPOSD has not considered local zoning activities which require CEQA

18 review, such as the issuance of a conditional use permit or variance, or rezoning.

19 d. Respondent SCAPOSD has not considered the project's parking capacity and deficiencies in

20 such capacity. All physical environmental impacts which may result from parking

21 deficiencies are environmental impacts which need to be evaluated under CEQA.
22

23 12. Respondent SCAPOSD has thereby violated their duties to conform to the requirements

24 of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines. Accordingly, the Notice must be set aside.
