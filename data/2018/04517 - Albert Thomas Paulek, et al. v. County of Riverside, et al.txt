1 INTRODUCTION

2.

1. In this action, Petitioners/Plaintiffs ALBERT THOMAS PAULEK, FRIENDS
OF THE NORTHERN SAN JACINTO VALLEY, and KEEP NUEVO RURAL
(*"Petitioners") challenge the December 12, 2017 decision of Respondents/Defendants

'7 COUNTY OF RIVERSIDE and COUNTY OF RIVERSIDE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS

8 ("County") approval of Resolution No. 2017-246 and Resolution No. 2017-239

10 Certifying Environmental Impact Report No. 471 prepared in connection with Specific

11 Plan No. 342, General Plan Amendment Nos. 720 and 721, Change of Zone No. 7055,

12 and Development Agreement No. 73 for the Villages of Lakeview Project for the benefit

13 of Real Party in Interest NUEVO DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION without first
14 complying with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
15

16 2. The Project application submitted by Nuevo Development Corporation

17 includes: Specific Plan No. 342, also known as The Villages of Lakeview, proposes a

18 maximum of 11,350 residential dwelling units and up to 70.5 acres of commercial uses

19 to be constructed within eight (8) Specific Plan Villages on a total of 2,883 acres;
20 General Plan Amendment No. 720, which includes a General Plan Technical
21

22 Amendment, Entitlement/Policy Amendment, a Foundation Component Amendment

23 Extraordinary, and an Agriculture Foundation Component to modify the land use

24 designations of the project area to match those proposed in the Specific Plan land use

25 plan; General Plan Amendment No. 721, which proposes modifications to the
26 Circulation Element of the General Plan; Change of Zone No. 7055, which proposes
27

28 to change the zoning to Specific Plan and adopt a Specific Plan zoning ordinance to

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate 2.

1 establish the permitted uses and development standards for the Specific Plan Planning

2 Areas, or such other zones as the Board may find appropriate; and Development
3
Agreement No. 73, which proposes an agreement between the County of Riverside 4

5 and the developer of the Specific Plan for development of the Villages of Lakeview

6 ("Project"). The Planning Commission recommended the Board of Supervisors deny

7 Specific Plan No. 342 as proposed by the applicant, approve Alternative 7 as Specific
8 Plan No. 342 and approve the other components of the project, and recommend
9
certification of Environmental Impact Report No. 471. 10

11 3. The Villages of Lakeview, 2883 acre development site is bisected by the

12 Ramona Expressway on the north and south in the now rural unincorporated
13 community of Nuevo situated in the predominately agricultural northern San Jacinto
14 Valley of western Riverside County. The northern border of the Villages of Lakeview
15

16 property shares a common boundary with the public lands of the San Jacinto Wildlife

17 Area (SJWA) managed by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. The SJWA

18 was established in the early 1980's as the mitigation site for the direct impacts of the

19 State Water Project (SWP) construction in Southern California. Since the initial SWP

20 mitigation acquisitions the state of California has continued to acquire private lands
21
acres of 22 from willing sellers such that the SJWA Davis Road Unit now comprises 10,000

23 contiguous public lands, including the historic Mystic Lake wetlands, dedicated to

24 wildlife conservation and outdoor recreation.

25 4. In 1995 the SJWA was included within the Stephens' kangaroo rat (SKR)
26 "Core " reserve system pursuant to a federal/state Habitat Conservation Plan
27

28 (SKRHCP). In 2004, the now 10,000 acre, San Jacinto Wildlife Area was again

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 designated a principal wildlife "conservation reserve" ["take" mitigation - for 146

2 species of plants and animals] under the western Riverside County Multiple Species
3
Habitat Conservation Plan (MSHCP) which permitted federal and state "incidental take" 4

5 of endangered and special status species outside of designated "conservation reserves",

6 such as SJWA, in western Riverside County. Under state law both the SKRHCP and the

7 MSHCP "take" permits were authorized pursuant to the Natural Communities

8 Conservation Planning Act (NCCP Act - Fish and Game Code §§ 2800-2835). Section
9
2826 of the NCCP Act provides: "Nothing in this chapter exempts a project proposed in 10

11 a natural community planning area from Division 13 (commencing with section

12 21000) of the Public Resources Code [CEQA] or otherwise alters the applicability of

13 that division."

14 5. On March 23, 2010 the Riverside County Board of Supervisors (BOS) adopted]
15

16 Resolutions Nos. 2010-88 and 2010-89 and Ordinance No. 348.4679 previously

17 approving the first Villages of Lakeview project and certification of a CEQA

18 Environmental Impact Report for that project. The 2010 County approval of the

19 original Villages of Lakeview project was then challenged by multiple environmental
20 organizations and the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Riverside
21

22 ordered the Board of Supervisors in 2012 to vacate the project approvals and EIR. The

23 Superior Court decision ordered the County to correct the analyses in the first EIR

24 including Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Air Quality (and related health effects),
25 Transportation and Traffic (regional traffic), Biological Resources (Habitat Conservation
26 Plan), Growth Inducing Impacts, and Land Use and Planning (consistency with General
27
Plan Policies). 28

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate 4

6. On December 12, 2017, the Riverside County Board of Supervisors abused its
2 discretion and did not proceed in the manner required by law in approving Resolution
3 No. 2017-246 and Resolution No. 2017-239 Certifying Environmental Impact Report 4

5 No. 471 for the second iteration of the Villages of Lakeview project. Petitioners

6 accordingly request that this court issue a writ of mandate under Cal. Code of Civil

7 Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5 directing Respondent to vacate and set aside all

8 their approvals for the Project. This request is based on the Following Allegations:
9

10

11 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

12

13 7. This court has jurisdiction over this petition pursuant to sections 1085, 1094-5,
14 187 and 526 of the California Code of Civil Procedure.
15

16 8. Venue in this action properly lies in Riverside County Superior Court because

17 Respondent and the site of the Project are located in Riverside County.

18

19 maintaining their established rural community, raising an awareness of any

20 development project planned in the Nuevo area, encouraging their neighbors to actively
21

22 participate at public hearings, lobbying our elected officials and public agency officials

23 to make sensible, well informed decisions about responsible planning and development,

24 and making certain that development at any scale is aligned with their agrarian life-style

25 and matched with the county's general and area plans. KNR members will be directly
26 impacted by the County's approval of the Villages of Lakeview project.

13

14 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS
15

16

17 18. Petitioners hereby re-allege and incorporate the allegations set forth in

18 paragraphs 1 through 17 inclusive.

19 19. In implementing its CEQA duty Riverside County failed to fully disclose to
20 the public the full range of significant environmental effects of the Village of Lakeview
21

22 Project. The County CEQA review did not properly prevent or minimize damage to the

23 environment through the correct development of project alternatives, mitigation

24 measures, and mitigation monitoring. The County failed to properly implement its

25 CEQA mandate that no project should be approved as proposed if there are feasible
26 alternatives or mitigation that would lessen those effects. Failure to comply with CEQA
27

28 to provide full disclosure of information to decision-makers and the public, which would

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate 8

1 result in relevant information not being presented to the public agency and the

2 questioning public constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion on the part of the County
3
and the complicit project proponent.
4

5 20. Mr. Paulek and members of the Friends and KNR provided written

6 comments on Draft and Final Environmental Impact Report for the Villages of Lakeview

7 project and presented oral and written objections to the project during the

8 administrative hearings on this matter pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21177.
9

10 Mr. Paulek, Friends and KNR and their members are directly, adversely, and irreparably

11 affected, and will continue to be prejudiced by the Riverside County Board of
12 Supervisors approval of the Villages of Lakeview project as described herein, until and

13 unless this Court provides the relief prayed for in this petition.

14 21. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code
15

16 section 21167.5 by serving a written notice of Petitioner's intent to commence this action

17 on Respondent on January 4, 2018. A copy of this written notice and proof of service is

18 attached as Exhibit A to this petition.

19 22. Petitioners sent a copy of this Petition to the California Attorney General on

20 January 8, 2018 to comply with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

15

16 28. Respondents have abused their discretion and failed to act as required by law

17 in the following ways:

18

19 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

20

21

22 VIOLATIONS OF CEQA (Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.)

23 Riverside County did not comply with CEQA

24

25 29. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set
26 forth in paragraphs 1-28 inclusive.
27

28

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate 10

1 30. Under state law both the SKRHCP and the MSHCP "take" permits were

2 authorized pursuant to the Natural Communities Conservation Planning Act (NCCP Act
3
Fish and Game Code §§ 2800-2035). Section 2826 of the NCCP Act provides: 4

5 "Nothing in this chapter exempts a project proposed in a natural community planning

6 area from Division 13 (commencing with section 21000) of the public Resources Code

7 [CEQA] or otherwise alters the applicability of that division." The Riverside County

8 EIR for the Villages of Lakeview Project reliance on SKRHCP and the MSHCP
9

10 compliance instead of actual CEQA compliance is contrary to the legislative directive of

11 the NCCP Act.

12 31. CEQA requires the identification of significant impacts to public wildlife

13 resources, analysis of alternatives to avoid or mitigate significant impacts, and requires
14 the lead agency to make specific "Findings" regarding identified significant impacts to
15

16 endangered plants and animals and public lands (SJWA). The subject EIR repeatedly

17 asserts direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts to endangered and special status species

18 and public lands (habitats) will "not be significant with mitigation" and there will

19 be future consultation and approvals by the County of Riverside, the primary beneficiary
20 of the federal and state "incidental take" permits. This is not CEQA compliance and the
21

22 EIR failure to comply with CEQA and the NCCP Act section 2826 must be corrected and

23 a revised CEQA document subject to public review.

24 32. The Draft EIR disregards substantial evidence to the contrary that the Project

25 is subject to Mandatory Findings of Significance pursuant to CEQA Guideline section

26 15065 (a)(1) [Draft EIR pp. 5.4-6.... Twenty-six special-status species were detected on
27

28 or immediately adjacent to the Specific Plan Area (see Table 5.4-A and Table 5.4-B)]

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate 11

1 Consequently, the Draft EIR avoids the necessary analysis of impacts/consideration of
2 alternatives for twenty-six special-status plants and animals (SKRHCP and MSHCP
3
covered species) and does not consider the cumulative impact [Guidelines § 4

5 15065(a)(3)J of the "take" of individual special-status species. Without meaningful

6 cumulative analysis there can never be any awareness or control over the "take" of these
7 special-status species as to that species population ultimate conservation/refuge on

8 designated conservation reserves, such as the San Jacinto Wildlife Area.
9
33.
10 The Project will designate approximately 1000 acres of the Specific Plan Area

11 for permanent conservation, including approximately 29 acres north of the Ramona

12 Expressway adjacent to the San Jacinto Wildlife Area and 958 acres located within the

13 Lakeview Mountains. The EIR provides no specific mitigation measures to validate
14 these proposed conservation designations. Absent specific mitigation measure(s) there
15

16 is no assurance the conservation designation will be realized or what property

17 mechanism [easement, fee transfer] will be used to realize wildlife habitat conservation

18 in perpetuity.

19 34: The Villages of Lakeview proposes the development of up to 11,350 dwelling
20 units and up to 500,000 square feet of commercial/retail/office space. The Specific
21

22 Plan seeks to provide housing for approximately 36,000 residents. The project will

23 generate a significant increase in traffic on the Ramona Expressway paralleling the

24 southern boundary of the San Jacinto Wildlife Area at the San Jacinto River crossing.

25 This will result in increased traffic noise intruding into the southern boundary of the
26 SJWA, to the detriment of SKRHCP and MSHCP covered species including the
27

28

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate 12

1 Stephens' kangaroo rat and the Northwestern San Diego pocket mouse. The Draft EIR

2 failed to consider or mitigate the impact of this intrusion of traffic noise onto the SJWA.
3 35. The County failed to comply with CEQA when it added General Plan 1165 to 4
the Villages of Lakeview Board Agenda item for review. At the December 12, 2017, vote

6 on the Villages of Lakeview project, Supervisor Jeffries changed his vote from denying

7 the VOL Project to approving the VOL Project because he was voting for General Plan

8 Amendment 1165 and he could not split his vote. CEQA requires that agencies inform
9

10 themselves about the environment effects of their proposed actions, carefully consider

11 all relevant information before they act, give the public an opportunity to comment on

12 the environmental issues, and avoid or reduce significant environmental impacts when

13 it is feasible to do so. Supervisor Jeffries complies with these reiquirements at the
14 December 5, 2017 tentative vote on the Villages of Lakeview project when he voted to
15

16 deny the project. The December 12, 2017 Villages of Lakeview vote and all its approvals

17 must be vacated because the addition of the unrelated General Plan Amendment 1165

18 made it impossible for any of the Supervisors to comply with the requirements of CEQA.

19 36. Contrary to the requirements of CEQA, the County did not prepare an EIR for
20 the 2017 Villages of Lakeview Specific Plan 342 (3.o). In 2010 the County approved SP
21

22 342 (1.0) and certified EIR 471 (1.0). In 2015, the County prepared SP 342 (2.0) and

23 circulated draft EIR 471 (2.o). In 2017 the County prepared Specific Plan 342 (3.o), but

24 did not prepare a new EIR for SP 342(3.o). Instead of preparing a new EIR for the new

25 2017 SP 342 (3.) the County merely certified the EIR (2.0) that was prepared for a
26 different project, SP 342 (2.0). All the Villages of Lakeview approvals must be vacated
27

28 and a new Initial Study and EIR prepared for the new project, SP 342 (3.0)

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate 13

37. Contrary to the Requirements of CEQA, the Villages of Lakeview General

2 Plan and zoning amendments fail to address the cumulative, growth inducing and loss
3

4 of agricultural lands in approving the Villages of Lakeview, which will result in the

5 creation of a new city and the infrastructure that is included with a new a city in a

6 primarily agricultural and rural living area. Although omitted from all of the specific

7 plans and EIR's the County during the 2010 and 2017 hearing referred directly and

8 indirectly to its vision for a new "City of Lakeview" to touch the boundaries of the cities
9

10 of Perris, Moreno Valley, San Jacinto, Hemet and Menifee. Rather than acknowledging

11 the vision of the City of Lakeview, the County grossly mischaracterizes the Village of

12 Lakeview as a "buffer" between itself and surrounding cities. In addition, the general

13 plan amendments are not an "emergency and are not consistent with the County's

14 current General Plan Vision. Because the direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a
15

16 new city were not identified, analyzed or mitigated in the EIR, all approvals must be

17 vacated.

18 38. As a result of the foregoing defects, the County of Riverside prejudicially

19 abused their discretion in approving the Villages of Lakeview project without first

20 complying with the California Environmental Quality Act. Accordingly, the Project
21

22 approval must be set aside.
