PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 Petitioner and Plaintiff Marina Coast Water District ("Petitioner," "MCWD," or the "District")
2 alleges as follows:

3 INTRODUCTION

4 1. This action challenges the decisions of the Respondent COUNTY OF MONTEREY

5 ("County") by and through its HEALTH DEPARTMENT ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH BUREAU
6 ("EHB") (collectively "Respondents") to approve Well Permit Application (Well. Permit 17-12898 for
7 Well ETS-20) on September 8, 2017, for construction and operation of a high-capacity agricultural well
8 (the "Project") for Real Parties in Interest BILL ARMSTRONG, ARMSTRONG SANDHILL RANCH,
9 LLC, and RAMCO ENTERPRISES, L.P. (collectively "Real Parties") without performance of
10 environmental review as required by the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public
11 Resources Code sections 21000 et seq., and the CEQA Guidelines, Title 14, California Code of
12 Regulations section 15000 et seq.

13 2. The Project, as approved, will pump up to 2,500 gallons per minute ("gpm"), potentially
14 more than 4,000 acre-feet per year (AFY"), from the 900-foot aquifer of the critically overdrafted
15 180/400 Foot Aquifer Subbasin (*180/400 Subbasin") of the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin
16 ("SVGB"). The Monterey County Water Resources Agency ("MCWRA") has recommended a
17 moratorium on pumping from the "900-foot" aquifer-the same aquifer the Project will pump from--
18 due to concerns regarding the potential adverse groundwater impacts of increased pumping.

19 3. MCWD relies on groundwater from the 180/400 Subbasin and the adjoining Monterey
20 Subbasin to supply municipal water service for over 33,000 residents in the Marina/Ord community. The
21 Project will potentially pump more groundwater than MCWD uses to supply the entire Marina/Ord
22 community.

23 4. MCWRA, MCWD, and others have made a concerted effort to reduce pumping from the
24 180/400 Subbasin and the Monterey Subbasin of the SVGB for the puxpose of restoring water quality
25 and protecting groundwater. MCWD and MCWRA have also expressly committed to work together on
26 measures to protect the "900-foot" aquifer of 180/400 Subbasin and the Monterey Subbasin of the
27 SVGB.

28 2
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

5. Despite these efforts and commitments, MCWD never received notice that the County
2 was considering approval of the Project and was surprised to learn of the County's approval without
3 compliance with CEQA.

4 6. Upon learning of the approval of the Project, MCWD consulted with its experts and
5 submitted a letter to the County explaining that the County's approval of the Project--without
6 mitigation and monitoring requiroments -has the potential to adversely impact groundwater supplies

7 and quality in the "900-foot" aquifer of the 180/400 Subbasin and the Monterey Subbasin of the SVGB.

8 MCWD attached a letter from its expert hydrogeologist confirming these adverse environmental impacts
and explaining the need to consider mitigation and monitoring prior to approving the Project. The letter
10 requested that the County rescind its approval of the Project and work with MCWD on mitigation or
11 alternatives to ensure groundwater resources are protected.

12 7. In approving the Project without conducting environmental review as required by CEQA,
13 Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law, in
14 violation of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines. As a result of BHB's failure to conduct environmental
15 review, Respondents made a decision without all of the information that they, responsible and trustee
16 agencies, and the public needed to properly weigh the consequences of the County's approval of the
17 Project. As a result of these failures, Respondents, responsible and trustee agencies, and the public were
18 deprived of the opportunity to consider mitigation and alternatives that could have addressed the
19 Project's adverse impacts.

20 8. MCWD seeks a writ of mandate and injunctive relief, vacating and setting aside the
21 Project approval, and enjoining Real Parties from proceeding with the Project, on the grounds that
22 Respondents violated CEQA and prejudicially abused their discretion when they approved the Project.

23 PARTIES

24 9. MCWD is a publicly owned county water district formed by the voters in 1960 to provide
25 potable water service to all residential, commercial, industrial, environmental, and fire protection uses in
26 the then unincorporated community of Marina. The City of Marina ("City") incorporated in 1975, but
27 MCWD has remained a separate public agency. The District also provides potable water delivery and

28 3
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

wastewater conveyance services within the boundaries of the former Fort Ord Army Base, known as the
2 Ord Community, MCWD is the sole provider of municipal water service for the over 33,000 residents in
3 its Marina and Ord Community service areas, who rely on MCWD for their domestic drinking water.
The District, as well as its residential and commercial customers, would be materially injured by the
5 activities that were approved in the Project.

10. MCWD is unaware of the true names and capacities of Petitioners and Plaintiffs
7| fictitiously named herein as Does through 100, inclusive. MCWD is informed and believe, and thereon

10 such Petitioners and Plaintiffs have standing to be joined as Petitioners and Plaintiffs in this proceeding.
11 MCWD will amend this Petition, with leave of the court if necessary, to allege the fictitiously named
12| Petitioners' and Plaintiffs' true names and capacities when ascertained.

13 11. Respondent MONTEREY COUNTY is, and at all times mentioned herein was, a political
14 subdivision of the State of California. The County with EHIB is, and at all relevant times was,
15 responsible for administering and carrying out its laws and all applicable federal and State laws,
16 including CEQA, in considering well permit applications within the County,

17 12. MCWD is unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents DOES 101 through
18 110, and sues such respondents by fictitious names. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on the basis
19 of such information and belief, that the fictitiously named respondents are responsible for actions
20 described in this Petition. When the true identities and capacities of these respondents have been
21 determined, Petitioner will amend this Petition, with leave of the court, if necessary, to insert such
22 identities and capacities.

23 13. The following entities are named as Real Parties in Interest pursuant to Section
24 21167.6.5, subdivision (a) of the Public Resources Code,

•25 14. MCWD is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Real Party in Interest
26 ARMSTRONG SANDHILL RANCH, LLC is, and at all times herein mentioned was, the applicant
27 and/or agent for the Project.

28 4
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

2 ARMSTRONG is, and at all times herein mentioned was, the property owner of the Project site.

3 16. MCWD is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Real Party in Interest and
4 RAMCO ENTERPRISES, L.P. has an interest in the Project.

5 17. MCWD is unaware of the true names and capacities of Real Parties in Interest/
6 Respondents DOES 111 through 120, and sues such respondents by fictitious names. MCWD is
informed and believes, and based on such information and belief, alleges that the fictitiously named real

8 parties in interest are directly and materially affected by the actions described in this Petition. When the
9 true identities and capacities of these real parties in interest have been determined, MCWD will amend
10 this Petition, with leave of the court if neoessary, to insert such identities and capacities.

11 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

12 18. MCWD re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in their
13 entirety,

14 19. This court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to Code of
15 Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and Public Resources Code section 21168 and 21168.5. Alternatively,
16 this Court has jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure section 1080 and Public Resources Code
17 section 21168.5.

18 20. Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the State of California in and
19 for the County of Monterey pursuant to section 349 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The Project is
20 located within Monterey County.

21 STANDING

22 21. MCWD re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in their
23 entirety.

24 22. The County had mandatory duties to comply with CEQA before approving the Project,

25 23. MCWD is beneficially interested in the County's full compliance with CEQA before the
26 County approves the Project.

27 24. MCWD has the right to enforce the mandatory duties imposed upon the County by law.

28 5
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

25. MCWD is a public agency charged with providing safe and reliable water service for
residential, commercial, industrial, environmental, and fire protection uses. MCWD serves
approximately 33,000 residents in its Marina and Ord Community service areas, who rely on MCWD

4 for their. domestic drinking water. The District currently pumps all of its water supply from groundwater
5 wells in the SVGB including the aquifer the Project will pump from.

26. MCWD has a substantial interest in ensuring the Project's impacts are fully mitigated.
Among other reasons, operation of this Project will adversely affect water supplies and water quality in
8 the SVGB, impairing MCWD's water rights, contracts, and ability to provide essential public services.

9 27. MCWD entered into a recorded annexation agreement with the Monterey County Water
10 Resources Agency, the City of Marina, the J.G. Armstrong Family, and RMC Lonestar: the Annexation
11 Agreement and Groundwater Mitigation Framework for Marina Area Lands dated March 1996. The
12 Annexation Agreement protects the groundwater resources of the SVGB. MCWD's rights under the
13 Annexation Agreement would be materially impaired and harmed by the Project, which is located within
14. the Marina Area Lands,

15 28. MCWD has standing to assert the claims alleged in this Petition because it is beneficially
16 interested in this matter, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1086. MCWD has a direct and
17 beneficial interest in the County's full compliance with CEQA and all other applicable laws with respect
18 to this Project.

19 29. MCWD has no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law,
20 and MCWD will suffer irreparable injury unless this Court issues the relief requested in this Petition.

21 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

22 30. MCWD re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in their
23 entirety.

24 31. MCWD received no notice that the County intended to approve the Project. MCWD is
25 informed and believes that no public notice was issued for either the County's CEQA determination or
26 for its decision to issue the well permit. The County provided no opportunity for MCWD or the public to
27 comment on the Project. MCWD and the public, therefore, are excused from CEQA's exhaustion

28 6
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIET

requirements for lack of notice, (Pub. Resources Code, § 21177, subd. (e); see also Defend Our
2 Waterfront v. California State Lands Commission (2015) 240 Cal.App.4th 570, 582-584.)

3 32. MCWD has exhausted all available administrative remedies.

4 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

33. MCWD re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in their

6 entirety.

34. On September 8, 2017, EHIB issued a permit for the Project.

35. When an agency approves a project without first complying with CEQA, a petition

9 challenging this determination must be filed 180 days after the agency's decision to carry out of approve
10 the project, unless the agency has filed a notice of exemption with the State Clearinghouse or the County

11 Clerk, which would trigger a 35-day statute of limitations. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21167; CEQA

12 Guidelines, § 15112.) MCWD is informed and believes that the County did not post a notice of

13 exemption for the Project or, alternatively, that any such notice was defective and did not meet the
14 requirements of CEQA. Thus, this Petition is timely filed within the 180-day time frame set forth under
15. CEQA.

16 NOTICE OF CEQA SUIT

17 36. MCWD re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in their
18 entirety.

19 37. On March 2, 2018, MCWD e-mailed and federal expressed a letter to the Monterey
20 County Clerk, giving notice to Respondents of MCWD's intent to file this lawsuit on or before March 5,
21 2018, seeking to invalidate the County's approval of the Project. This letter satisfied Petitioner's duty

22 under Public Resources Code section 21167.5.

23 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

24 38. MCWD r6-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in their
25 entirety,

26 A. Factual Background

27 39. MCWD relies on groundwater from the "900-foot" aquifer of the 180/400 Subbasin and

28 the adjoining Monterey Subbasin of the SVGB to provide municipal water service to the Marina/Ord
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

community---which is dependent on MCWD to provide safe and reliable domestic water. As the sole
provider of municipal water service for over 33,000 residents, MCWD extracts groundwater from the
"900-foot" aquifer from several wells. MCWD pumps water from these wells and then delivers this
water to MCWD's customers. The Project will pump groundwater from the same «900-foot" aquifer

5 that MCWD's groundwater wells pump water to supply water to the Marina/Ord community.
40. The 180/400 Subbasin of the SVGB is not adjudicated, and it supplies water to a number
of existing municipal, industrial, and agricultural users, including MCWD's 33,000 plus customers that
depend on this Subbasin and adjoining Monterey Subbasin for their domestic water. MCWD and others
9| have been taking steps to eliminate the long term overdraft condition of the SVGB.
10 41. As part of an effort to protect the groundwater for its 33,000 residents, the District
11 entered into a recorded annexation agreement with MCWRA, the City of Marina, the J.G. Armstrong
12 Family, and RMC Lonestar: the Annexation Agreement and Groundwater Mitigation Framework for
13 Marina Area Lands dated March 1996, The Annexation Agreement protects the groundwater resources
14 of the 180/400 Subbasin and the Monterey Subbasin of the SVGB.

15 42. As a party to the Annexation Agreement, the County committed to managing the 900-
16 foot aquifer to "provide safe, sustained use of the water resource, and to preserve to MCWD the
17 continued availability of water from the 900-foot aquifer." MCWD and the County also committed to
18 work together on measures to protect the "900-foot aquifer."

19 B. County's Approval of Project Two Days after Receiving Well Permit Application Without Notice or CEQA Review
20 43. On September 6, 2017, the County received a well permit application for the Project.
21 44. The Project proposed the drilling and operation of a high-capacity well on property
22 located at 14995 Del Monte Boulevard in Marina, California (APN 175-011-050-000) agricultural
23 irrigation. The Project will draw water from the $900-foot" aquifer of the SVGB at a rate of up to 2,500
24 gallons per minute, which amounts to more than 4,000 AFY.
25 45. As part of the well application review, MCWRA's hydrologist made a conclusory finding
26 without citation to any facts or analysis that the well did not "indicate potential for significant adverse
27 impact to existing domestic wells, water system wells, or in-stream flows based on an assessment using
28 8
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

regional aquifer parameters."

2 46. On September 8, 2017, two days after receiving the application for the Project, the
3 County approved the Project without any publiò notice, notice to MCWD, or performance of
4| environmental review as required by CEQA. The County's approval did not include any mitigation or
monitoring requirements.
C. CEQA Applies to the Couuty's Approval of the Project
47. Ast first step in the CEQA process, agencies must conduct a preliminary review in order

8 to determine whether CEQA applies to a proposed activity. As part of this review, the agency is to

9 determine whether the activity is a "projeot" for purposes of CEQA, and if it is, whether it falls under an

10 exemption. (See e.g., Sierra Club v. County of Sonoma (2017) 11 Cal.App.5th 11, 19.)

11 48. CEQA applies to "discretionary projects proposed to be carried out or approved by public

12 agencies." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21080, subd. (a).) A permit is "discretionary,' and thus subject to
13 CEQA, if the decision-maker has discretion to modify (or deny) the project or impose conditions on the
14 permit that would mitigate any potential environmental impacts in a meaningful way. (See Mountain

15 Lion Foundation v. Fish & Game Com. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 117; Central Basin Municipal Water
16 Dist. v. Water Replenishment Dist. of Southern California (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 943, 949.)

17 49. Monterey County's "well program" codified in Chapter 15.08 of the Monterey County

18 Code provides the County's Health Officer with ample discretion to deny or modify a well permit to

19 address environmental concerns. Nothing in the ordinance requires that permits be approved, if any
20 specified conditions or standards are satisfied. (See Section 15.08.060 - Permit-Issuance or denial.)

21 The ordinance specifically provides the Health Officer with discretion to "condition the permit in any

22 manner he or she deems necessary to carry out the purposes of this Chapter." (Ibid.) The ordinance

23 further states that the Health Officer "shall deny an application for a permit if, in his or her judgment, its

24 issuance would tend to defeat the purposes of this Chapter," which as stated is to ensure "that the
25 groundwater of this County will not be polluted or contaminated and that water obtained from such

26 wells will be suitable for the purpose for which used and will not jeopardize the health, safety or welfare

27 of the people of this County." (Section 15.08.010 - Purpose, italics added.) Thus, the ordinance allows

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 the Health Officer to use his or her judgment to determine whether a permit should be conditioned or
2 even denied if there is environmental harm (e.g., groundwater pollution, water supply issues), and what
3 type of conditions to impose in a particular circumstance, if any.
50. As part of the well application review, a MCWRA hydrologist made a conclusory finding
without citation to any facts or analysis that the well did not "indicate potential for significant adverse
6 impact to existing domestic wells, water system wells, or in-stream flows based on an assessment using
7 regional aquifer parameters." While this assessment conflicts with the County's conclusions in
8 MCWRA's own "Recommendations to Address the Expansion of Seawater Intrusion in the Salinas
9 Valley Groundwater Basin," the assessment lends further support to the conclusion that issuance of Well
10 Permit 17-12898 is a discretionary action.
11 51. Furthermore, numerous otber ordinances, regulations, and statutes provide the County
12 with discretion and authority to regulate this well, including but not limited to Monterey County Water
13 Resources Agency Act; the 2010 Monterey County General Plan Agency, Policy PS-3.5; and
14 Sustainable Groundwater Management Act. The County was required to consider these authorities
15 during the County's environmental review of the Project,

16 52. The County provided no notice or information to MCWD or the public related to its
17| consideration or approval of the Project,
18 53. Upon learning of the County's approval of the Project, MCWD submitted a letter to the
19 County alerting the County that its approval of the Project was discretionary and therefore
20 environmental review must be performed. The letter explained that the Project has the potential to
21 significantly impact water quality and water supplies in the SVGB and MCWD's wells. The letter
22 further noted that the County's own reports provide ample evidence that the Project has the potential to
23 significantly impact water quality and water supplies in the SVGB and MCWD's wells.
24 54. Specifically, the letter noted that MCWRA's recent publication "Recommendations to
25 Address the Expansion of Seawater Intrusion in the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin" determined the
26 need for an "immediate moratorium on groundwater extractions from new wells within the entirety of
27 the Deep Aquifers of the 180/400 Foot Aquifer and Monterey Subbasins" based on its concerns that

28 10
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

additional pumping from the "900-foot" aquifer has the potential to induce additional leakage from
2 overlying aquifers and the potential to exacerbate seawater intrusion.

3 55. MCWD also explained the County was in possession of ample information prior to its
approval of the Project demonstrating that the approval of the well could significantly impact
groundwater supplies and quality in the SVGB. Specifically, the County was aware that California
6 Dopartment of Water Resources identified the 180/400 Subbasin as critically overdrafted in January of
7 2016. The County was also aware that MCWRA's "State of the Salinas River Groundwater Basin,"

8 determined that existing pumping from the SVGB was not sustainable and recommended pumping

9 reductions. Additionally, the County was aware that MCWRA's Report entitled "Protective Elevations
10 to Control Seawater Intrusion in the Salinas Valley," explained the need for additional groundwater
11 management projects to reduce coastal area pumping. MCWD's letter noted that this substantial
12 evidence demonstrated the County was required to perform environmental review pursuant to CEQA
13 prior to approving the Project.

14 56. MCWD's letter was accompanied by expert evidence from MCWD's hydrogeologist
15 explaining that the Project had the potential to adversely impact groundwater in the 180/400 Subbasin
16 and the adjoining Monterey Subbasin and MCWD's wells, both directly and cumulatively, unless
17 enforceable mitigation measures are made conditions of the County's approval.

18 57. MCWD's letter then requested the County rescind its approval of Well Permit 17-12898
19 until such time as the County has performed adequate CEQA analysis of the significant environmental
20 effects that may result from the construction and operation of Project--including, at a minimum, the
21 potential degradation of groundwater quality and water supply issues in the €900-foot" aquifer.

22 58. Respondents' approval of the Project is a discretionary approval subject to CEQA. No
23 CEQA exemptions apply to the Project.

24 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
Violations of CEQA (Public Resources Code, $ 21000 et seg.)
25 59. MCWD re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in their
26 entirety.
27 60. CEQA applies to discretionary projects that are undertaken, funded, or approved by
28 11
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 public agencies.

2 61. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion and failed to act in the manner required
3 by law in failing to conduct any environmental review prior to approving the Project.

4 62. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion and failed to act in the manner required

5 by law by failing to support its conclusion that the Project did not "indicate potential for significant
6 adverse impact to existing domestic wells, water system wells, or in-stream flows based on an
7 assessment using regional aquifer parameters" with substantial evidence.

8 63. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion in approving the Project because

9 Respondents' approval of the Project may result in one or more significant effects on the environment.
10 Substantial evidence demonstrates that, at a minimum, Respondents failed to adequately disclose,
11 evaluate, or mitigate the Project's direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts on groundwater.
12 64. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion and failed to act in the manner required
13 by law in failing to make the findings required by CEQA prior to the approval of the Project.
14 65. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion and failed to act in the manner required
15 by law by approving a Project in a manner that does not comply with the requirements of CEQA.

16 66. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents' approval of the Project is contrary to
17 law, invalid, and must be set aside.

18 67. Petitioner has no plain; speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law unless
19 this court grants the requested writ of mandate to require the County to set aside their approval of the
20 Project. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' decision will remain in effect in violation of
21 State law and Petitioner will be irreparably harmed. No money damages or legal remedy could
22 adequately compensate Petitioner for that harm.

23 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

24 Wherefore, Petitioner prays for judgment against Respondents as follows:

25 1. For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent
26 injunctions restraining the County and its agents, employees, officers and representatives from taking
