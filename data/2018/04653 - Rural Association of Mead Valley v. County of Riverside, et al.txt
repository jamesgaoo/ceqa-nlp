24 PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 21167.7, that on
25 July 25, 2018, Petitioner, RURAL ASSOCIATION OF MEAD VALLEY, filed a Verified
26 Petition for Peremptory Writ of Mandate pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act
27 (CEQA) challenging the approval by the COUNTY OF RIVERSIDE of the Knox Business
28 1
Notice to Attorney General

1 Park Buildings D and E Project, which proposes the construction and operation of two large
2 warehouse distribution centers on approximately 59 acres of vacant land in the rural community
3 of Mead Valley.

4 The Project will comprise two buildings totaling 1,113,627 square feet as well as related
5 improvements and infrastructure. The buildings are anticipated to operate as high cube

6 warehouse logistics centers, meaning that trucks traveling from distant locations such as the

7 Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles will bring cargo to the warehouse buildings for storage

8 and sorting for transport on other trucks to destinations in and outside California. These

9 operations may occur 24 hours per day, seven days per week. The EIR anticipates the Project

10 will generate approximately 2,115 total daily vehicle trips including 806 daily diesel truck trips.

11 Existing rural residences are located within approximately 275 feet of the Project site and truck

12 activity.

13 The Petition alleges that the County failed to comply with CEQA in certifying an

14 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the Project. Among other deficiencies, the EIR

15 ignores feasible mitigation for significant air quality impacts - namely measures that would

16 address the Project's harmful diesel emissions. Also for instance, the EIR wrongly assumes
that no trucks will travel on local roadways, and therefore the EIR fails to evaluate the adverse
17 effects of hundreds of diesel truck trips per day on the surrounding rural community.
18 For the reasons alleged in the Verified Petition for Peremptory Writ of Mandate
19 (transmitted herewith), the decisions approving the Project and certifying the Project's EIR
20 must be overturned.

2 INTRODUCTION

3 1. This action challenges the approval by Respondent, County of Riverside
4 ("County"), on or about June 26, 2018, of the Knox Business Park Buildings D
5 and E Project, including approval of Resolution No. 2018-130 certifying Final

6 Environmental Impact Report No. 546, Resolution No. 2018-118 approving
7 General Plan Amendments Nos. 1151 1152, and all related land use approvals

8 (collectively, "the Project").

9 2. The Project concerns the conversion of approximately 59 acres of vacant land in
10 the rural community of Mead Valley to warehouse distribution center uses. The

11 Project comprises two buildings totaling 1,113,627 square feet as well as related
12 improvements and infrastructure. The buildings are anticipated to operate as
13 high cube warehouse logistics centers, meaning that trucks traveling from
14 locations such as the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles will bring cargo to
15 the warehouse buildings for storage and sorting for transport on other trucks to
16 destinations in and outside California. These operations may occur 24 hours per
17 day, seven days per week. The EIR anticipates the Project will generate
18 approximately 2,115 total daily vehicle trips including 806 daily diesel truck
19 trips. Existing residences are located within approximately 275 feet of the
20 Project site and truck activity, yet the adverse and significant impacts associated
21 with the Project have not been adequately evaluated and/or mitigated in violation
22 of the California Environmental Quality ("CEQA") (Public Resources Code §
23 21000 et seq.). Indeed, the County's decision to approve the Project runs
24 counter to the recommendation of the California Air Resources Board ("CARB")
25 that industrial uses like the Project should not be located within 1,000 feet of

26 residences and other sensitive receptors.

27 3. The County of Riverside's certification of the Environmental Impact Report
28 ("EIR") for the Project must be vacated because the EIR fails to comply with

-2-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 CEQA in a number of important ways, including that the County failed to adopt
2 all feasible mitigation and alternatives for significant impacts. The decision to
3 approve the Project without imposing all feasible mitigation and alternatives is
4 contrary to CEQA's "substantive mandate" that the lead agency shall not
5 a approve a project with significant impacts where feasible mitigation or
6 alternatives exist to reduce the impacts.

7 4. During the administrative review process, numerous interested parties notified
8 the County that there was need for further analysis and mitigation due to the
9 Project's adverse effects. In spite of these reasoned comments in the record, the
10 County approved the Project and certified the EIR.

11 5. By this verified petition, Petitioner alleges the following:
12 PARTIES

13 6. Petitioner, RURAL ASSOCIATION OF MEAD VALLEY ('RAMV"), is an
14 unincorporated association composed of individuals residing within the Mead
15 Valley area of Riverside County. RAMV's goals include protecting rural
16 Riverside from incompatible industrial development. RAMV submitted
17 comments opposing approval of the Project to the County.
18 7. Respondent, COUNTY OF RIVERSIDE, is a political subdivision of the State of
19 California. The County is a local governmental agency charged with the
20 authority of regulating and administering local land use and development within
21 its territory in compliance with the provisions of its general plan and zoning
22 ordinances as well as applicable provisions of State law, including CEQA. The
23 County is the lead agency for the Project and is therefore charged with the duty
24 of ensuring compliance with applicable State and local laws.

25 8. Real Party in Interest, TRAMMELL CROW SO. CAL. DEVELOPMENT, INC.,
26 was the applicant for the Project, has an ownership interest in the property,
27 and/or claims an interest in the Project approvals at the subject of this lawsuit.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 9. DOES 1 through 100 are individuals or entities that may have an ownership

2 interest in the property, were project applicants, or claim an interest in the
3 approvals at the subject of this lawsuit. Petitioner is unaware of the true names

4 or capacities of the Real Parties in Interest identified herein under the fictitious

5 names DOES through 100 inclusive.

6 STATEMENT OF FACTS

7 The Project

8 10. The Knox Business Park Buildings D and E project is described as a proposal for
9 the construction and operation of two industrial warehouse logistics buildings,

10 totaling 1,113,627 square feet, on approximately 59 vacant acres in the Mead
11 Valley area of Riverside County.

12 11. Mead Valley is a community typified by large-lot, rural residential uses. Lands
13 surrounding the Project site are primarily rural residential homes or
14 undeveloped.

15 12. The Project site is located south of Oleander Avenue, north of Redwood Drive

16 and east and west of Ellsworth Street/Decker Road. The site is located

17 approximately 0.4 miles west of Interstate 215.

18 13. The Project site is split into two "sites" by Ellsworth Street/Decker Road. The

19 Building D site is located on approximately 37.1 acres east of Ellsworth

20 Street/Decker Road. The Building E site is located on approximately 21.5 acres
21 west of Ellsworth Street/Decker Road.

22 14. Ellsworth Street/Decker Road is currently a dirt and/or unimproved road. The
23 Project is described as improving Ellsworth Street/Decker Road between

24 Oleandar Avenue to the southern boundary of the Project site. The EIR assumes

25 that no trucks will use Ellsworth Street/Decker Road; rather, the EIR assumes
26 that all trucks will use Oleandar Avenue for ingress/egress to the Project site.
27 15. Surrounding land uses include lands designated by the County General Plan
28

-4-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Rural Community - Very Low Density Residential (RC-VLDR) to the south and

2 southwest of the Project site.

3 16. Existing rural residences are located to the immediate south of the Project site

4 located on Redwood Drive. According to the EIR, the nearest sensitive receptors

5 are occupied residences located approximately 276 feet from the Building D's

6 southern boundary line. Properties to the north and east are predominately

7 undeveloped except for a recently constructed industrial warehouse building

8 located north of Oleandar Avenue and east of Harvill Avenue. To the west of

9 the Project site are undeveloped lands and single-family homes.

10 17. The Building E site's existing General Plan Land Use Designation is Community

11 Development - Business Park. The western portion of Building D is designated
12 Community Development - Business Park. The eastern and northern portion of

13 the Building D site is designated Community Development - Light Industrial

14 under the General Plan.

15 18. The Building E site is zoned Rural Residential ½-acre minimum (R-R-1/2) and
16 Industrial Part (I-P). The Building D site is zoned a mix of Industrial Part (I-P),

17 Rural Residential (1-acre minimum R-R-1) and Manufacturing Medium (M-M).
18 19. The Project will likely function as a high-cube/ logistics warehouse facility for

19 storage, distribution, and goods-movement. As such, the Project is a truck-

20 intensive use.

21 20. The Project includes the following land use approvals:
22 a) General Plan Amendment No. 1151 changing the General Plan Land
23 Use Designation for the two parcels that will comprise the Building D
24 site from Community Development: Business Park (CD-BP) to

25 Community Development: Light Industrial (CD-LI) to make the entire
26 Building D site Community Development: Light Industrial (CD-LI);
27 b) Change of Zone No. 7872 changing the zoning classification for the
28

-5-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 two parcels that will comprise the Building D site from Rural
2 Residential (R-R) to Industrial Park (I-P) and portions of the parcels
3 that are zoned Medium Manufacturing (M-M) to Industrial Park (I-P)
4 to make the entire Building D site Industrial Park (I-P).

5 c) Plot Plan No. 25838 proposing the construction and operation of a
6 702,645 sq. ft. warehouse/distribution/manufacturing building on
7 37.08-acres with 109 truck loading bays, 251 trailer parking stalls, 439

8 automobile parking stalls and all other necessary improvements.
9 d) General Plan Amendment No. 1152 changing the General Plan Land
10 Use Designation for the parcels that will comprise the Building E site
11 from Community Development: Business Park (CD-BP) to
12 Community Development: Light Industrial (CD-LI) to make the entire
13 Building E site Community Development: Light Industrial (CD-LI);
14 e) Change of Zone No. 7873 changing the zoning classification for the
15 parcels that will comprise the Building E site E from Rural Residential -
16 ½ acre minimum (R-R1/2) to Industrial Park (I-P) to make the entire
17 Building E site Industrial Park (I-P).
18 f) Plot Plan No. 25837 proposing the construction and operation of a
19 410,982 square foot warehouse/distribution/manufacturing building on
20 21.52 acres with 51 truck loading bays, 80 truck trailer parking stalls,
21 and 260 automobile parking spaces and other necessary
22 improvements.

23 CEQA Review and Project Approval

24 21. The Draft EIR was circulated for public comment in May 2017. The Draft EIR

25 finds that the Project will result in significant and unavoidable impacts in the
26 areas of air quality, land use and planning, noise, and transportation/traffic.
27 22. The Project's Final EIR was completed on or about March 2, 2018 and was
28

-6-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

P circulated on or about March 6, 2018.

2

3 23. On April 4, 2018, the Riverside County Planning Commission held a public

4 hearing and voted to recommend approval of the Project to the Board of

5 Supervisors. The Planning Commission's action included a recommendation to

6 approve Tentative Parcel Maps Nos. 36950 and 36962 which have been

7 described as being part of "the Project" including in the Final EIR's Project
Description section.

8

9 24. On April 11, 2018, the applicant submitted a request to the Planning Department

10 requesting to withdraw the application for Tentative Parcel Maps Nos. 36950

11 and 36962. Staff recommended that the Project exclude the Tentative Parcel

12 Maps because Staff and the applicant had agreed to "alternative methods to

13 consolidate parcels and shift lot lines via a Parcel Merger and Lot Line

14 Adjustment" according to the Staff Report. The Final EIR was not revised or

15 recirculated based on this change in the Project Description.

16 25. On May 1, 2018, the Riverside County Board of Supervisors held a public

17 hearing on the Project. Numerous persons testified in opposition to the Project.

18 The Board continued the item to May 22, 2018. Petitioner is unsure whether the

19 Board closed the public hearing for purposes of receiving any further public
testimony.

20

21 26. Prior to the Board of Supervisors meeting regarding the Project, the County

22 published an Agenda which included the Tentative Parcel Maps as part of the
Project approvals being considered.
23

24 27. At the May 1, 2018 Board of Supervisors meeting, the applicant "discussed"

25 purported "project enhancements" to include paving an extension of Ellsworth

26 Street/Decker Road south of the development just to Redwood Drive. Based on

27 conflicting and changing information during the administrative process,

28 is Petitioner is unaware of the precise nature of the improvements to Ellsworth

-7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 Street/Decker Road that will occur in connection with the Project. In some
instances, the record describes that Ellsworth/Decker Road will be left

3

4 unimproved south of the Project boundary. In other instances, the Project is

5 described as requiring alternative secondary access via Ellsworth Street/Decker

6 Road "consistent with the areas analyzed in the project's EIR".

7 28. On May 22, 2018, the Board of Supervisors took action to "tentatively certify"

8 the EIR, "tentatively approve" the General Plan Amendments, "tentatively

9 approve" the Changes of Zone as well as to "approve" the Plot Plan and

10 "approve" the Parcel Map subject to final approval of the General Plan

11 Amendment, Change of Zone and certification of the EIR. Although the public

12 hearing was purportedly closed, Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon

13 alleges, that the Board received testimony from Staff regarding new and

14 modified conditions of approval, including new purported conditions relating to
transportation improvements.
15

16 29. Accordingly, the Board of Supervisors "approved" the Plot Plans prior to

17 approval of the General Plan Amendments. Petitioner is informed and believes,

18 and thereon alleges, that the Board cannot approve Plot Plans findings that the

19 approvals are consistent with the General Plan without the General Plan
Amendments.

20

21 30. Moreover, the Board "tentatively" certified the Final EIR, before the CEQA

22 Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations were approved.

23 These items were not available at the time of the May 22, 2018 Board of

24 Supervisors meeting, and indeed the public never had the opportunity to review

25 or comment on the CEQA Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding
Considerations.

26

27 31. On June 26, 2018, the Board of Supervisors via a Policy Calendar item took

28 action to approve the resolutions certifying the Final EIR, adopting the General

-8-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

H

2 Plan Amendments, approving the Zone Changes and all related Project
approvals.

3

4 32. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the County posted

5 the Notice of Determination ("NOD") pursuant to CEQA on June 28, 2018.

6 33. The County's approval of the Project will cause Petitioner irreparable injury

7 for which Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law. Petitioner and its members

8 will be irreparably harmed by the County's actions in approving the Project.

9 Petitioner was harmed by, among other things, the failure of the County in its

10 certification of the EIR to adequately evaluate the potential impacts of the

11 Project, and the County's approval of the Project without providing adequate and

12 effective mitigation measures contrary to the requirements of State law.
34. The maintenance of this action is for the

13 purpose of enforcing important public

14 policies of the State of California with respect to the protection of the

15 environment under CEQA and conformance with state law and local law. The

16 maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a substantial benefit upon

17 the public by protecting the public from environmental and other harms alleged

18 in this Petition. Petitioner is acting as a private attorney general to enforce these
public policies and prevent such harm.
19 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

20

21 35. This Court has jurisdiction to issue writs of mandate under Code of Civil
Procedure Section 1094.5.

22

23 36. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure

24 Sections 393 and 394 as the Project is located in, and the relevant events
occurred in Riverside County.

25

26 37. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing the action by

27 complying with the requirements of Public Resources Code § 21167.5, in

28 notifying Respondent of the filing of this action (attached hereto as Exhibit "A"),

4 Exhibit "B").

5 Il

6 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

7 38. During all phases of the Project's administrative review process, Petitioner

8 commented to the County that the Project would result in potentially significant
9 impacts to/from including, but not limited to: air quality, biological resources,
10 greenhouse gas emissions, noise, traffic and others. Petitioner commented that
11 the EIR was legally inadequate; that further mitigation was required; and that
12 project alternatives were feasible.
13 39. As a result of these comments in the record, Petitioner exhausted its

14 administrative remedies within the meaning of Cal. Public Resources Code c0n
15 21177.

16 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

17 (Writ of Mandate)
18 (All parties did not comply with the requirements of CEQA.)

19 40. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 39 above as
20 though set forth in full herein.
21 41. The California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") (Public Resources Code §
22 21100 et seq.), enacted in 1971, requires government agencies to consider the
23 environmental consequences of their actions before approving projects subject to
24 CEQA's provisions.
25 42. The Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") is considered "the heart" of CEQA.
26 To effectuate the Legislature's goals of environmental protection, CEQA
27 provides that an adequate EIR must evaluate all potentially significant
28

-10-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 environmental impacts of a proposed project including both direct and indirect

3 impacts as well as cumulative impacts. (State CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15126,
15126.2 (a), 15130)
4

5 43. Petitioner and others commented that the EIR fails to adequately evaluate

6 impacts to/from including, but not limited to, aesthetics, air quality, biology,
energy, greenhouse gas emissions, noise, and traffic.

7

8 44. By way of example, Petitioner commented extensively that the EIR improperly

9 assumes that no trucks will use Ellsworth Street/Decker Road for Project ingress

10 and egress and for access to other local roadways in route to Interstate 215 or

11 other major roadways. Ellsworth Street/Decker Road from the Project's

12 southern property line to Markham Street is an unimproved dirt road that is not

13 County maintained and is therefore not adequate for heavy truck traffic. The

14 Project entails improvements to Ellsworth Street/Decker road such as paving it

15 at least from Oleandar Avenue to the southern Project boundary. However, if

16 trucks use this road south of the Project boundary, which is likely, there are a

17 number of impacts - such as traffic, noise, and air quality - that have been

18 entirely ignored by the EIR. The use of Ellsworth Street/Decker Road by trucks

19 will greatly impact the residences and receptors to the south of the Project site.

20 45. By way of further example, the EIR's traffic study is artificially limited to

21 evaluation of the immediate Project area, where the Project may impact a greater a

22 geographical area. Specifically, the EIR inadequately considers southbound

23 traffic trips to utilize Cajalco Road (a.k.a. Cajalco Expressway) as an east/west

24 route for Project trucks. Cajalco Road is located just 1.2 miles south of the

25 Project site and is regularly a faster route to and from the Ports of Long Beach

26 and Los Angeles than northbound on I-215. The County acknowledges that a

27 Cajalco Road widening project is planned. As such, the EIR should have, but

28 did a not, evaluate a scenario where Project traffic will use this road.

-11-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 46. By way of further example, Petitioner commented that because the County's

2 2015 Climate Action Plan ("CAP") only addresses impacts and compliance with

3 reduction targets up to year 2020, there is not evidence that compliance with the
4 CAP would meet longer term emissions targets including those established in

5 Executive Order B-30-15, which seeks to reduce GHG emissions in the State to

6 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030; and 80 percent below 1990 levels by
7 2050. As noted in Center for Biological Diversity v. Department of Fish &

8 Wildlife (2015) 62 Cal.4th 204, 223 ("Newhall Ranch"), "over time consistency
9 with year 2020 goals will become a less definitive guide, especially for long-
10 term projects that will not begin operations for several years. An EIR taking a
11 goal-consistency approach to CEQA significance may in the near future need to
12 consider the project's effects on meeting longer term emissions reduction
13 targets." Because Project operation is anticipated to commence in year 2020,

14 consistency with the CAP 2020 goals is inadequate measure to demonstrate
15 compliance with longer-term State emission reduction targets.

16 47. CEQA establishes a substantive mandate on the part of the lead agency to
17 mitigate the significant environmental impacts of a project. (Public Resources
18 Code § 21002, 21002.1; State CEQA Guidelines, § 15021 (a).) A lead agency
19 may not approve a project for which there are significant environmental impacts

20 unless the agency makes findings that: (a) mitigation measures have been
21 required of the project which avoid or substantially lessen the significant
22 environmental impacts, or (b) mitigation measures are found to be infeasible

23 based on substantial evidence. (Public Resources Code §§ 21081, 21081.5; State
24 CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15091 (a)(b), 15092 (b).)

25 48. Petitioner and others commented extensively that the Project fails to adopt all

26 feasible mitigation including mitigation to reduce significant NOx impacts. The
27 South Coast Air Quality Management District (*AQMD") wrote, regarding the
28

-12-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 Project, that the most significant air quality challenge facing southern California

3 is to reduce NOx emissions. According to the AQMD, achieving NOx emission

4 reduction in a timely manner is critical to attaining the National Ambient Air

5 Quality Standard ("NAAQS") for ozone beyond the 2023 and 2031 deadlines.

6 The California Air Resources Board states that trucks and buses account for

7 roughly 32 percent of statewide emissions of NOx. CARB concurs that reducing

8 emissions from trucks is necessary to meet federal clean air standards.

9 Accordingly, the County received comments proposing a number of feasible air

10 quality mitigation measures that should be adopted to lessen significant NOx

11 emissions due to the Project. These feasible measures were not adopted, and the

12 County failed to demonstrate, based on substantial evidence in the record, that
the measures were infeasible.

13

14 49. For instance, Petitioner proposed that the Project include the required phase-in,

15 or periodic review for feasibility, of electric, hybrid electric, hydrogen electric,

16 battery operated, or natural gas powered (i.e., non-diesel) trucks. Non-diesel

17 trucks are reasonably foreseeable in the commercial market and therefore are

18 feasible within the life of the Project. The County did not demonstrate based on

19 substantial evidence that such a measure is infeasible within the meaning of

20 CEQA. Rather, the County flatly asserts that it does not have the power to

21 require any measures to employ cleaner truck technologies, which is simply
inadequate and not based in fact or law.

22

23 50. Again for instance, Mitigation Measure (MM) 4.3-8 proposes the Project roof(s)

24 be constructed to incorporate a 1 KW PV solar array to offset Project operational

25 air quality impacts. However, it is feasible to design the roof to accommodate a

26 maximally sized solar array and require incorporation of substantially more PV

27 solar power. Given the Project's estimated electricity demand of 4,381,622

28 kWh/year, proposed development to accommodate a 1 KW system, which would

-13-

1 generate around 1,674 kWh/year, is insignificant. The County argues that
2 increasing solar is not reasonably related to a "significant" Project impact; yet
3 the EIR proposes MM 4.3-8 "to reduce the Project's significant impacts to
4 regional operation-source emissions associated with NOx.." Because

5 additional solar utilization has not been shown to be infeasible, the approval of

6 the Project was in error.

7 51. CEQA additionally provides that adopted mitigation measures must be certain

8 and enforceable. (Public Resources Code § 21081.6(b); State CEQA Guidelines,
9 § 15126.6(a)(2).) The lead agency must ensure that mitigation measures are
10 required by or incorporated into the project to ensure that the measures are
11 actually carried out. (Public Resources Code § 21081.6 (a), (b).)
12 52. Petitioner and others commented in the record that adopted mitigation measures
13 are not certain and enforceable. By way of example, the EIR's traffic analysis
14 concludes that the Project's impact to the intersection of Ellsworth Street/Decker
15 Road and Oleander Avenue is significant. The Project is conditioned to make a
16 "fair share" contribution for the necessary traffic improvements. However, the
17 conclusion that the Project has only a minor or "proportional" impact to this
18 intersection is highly dubious in view of the very low existing traffic counts and
19 the increase in traffic counts at this intersection attributable only to the Project,
20 where there is an absence of any other intense development that would impact
21 this intersection. The traffic study repeatedly indicates that the intersection will
22 operate at LOS (Level of Service) D with a "future intersection" or a future

23 "traffic signal", which is apparently an acceptable LOS; but it is not clear from
24 the EIR that the Project will be implementing necessary traffic improvements to
25 maintain this "acceptable" LOS, so that impacts remain significant until such
26 improvements are implemented. This is not adequate, certain and enforceable
27 mitigation under the circumstances and impacts remain significant.

53. CEQA's provides that a lead agency must evaluate alternatives to the proposed

2 project, or the location of the project, which would attain most of the basic
3 objectives of the project but would avoid or substantially lessen any of the

4 project's significant environmental effects. (State CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.6

5 (a).) The lead agency has a duty to adopt a project alternative if it is feasible.

6 (Public Resources Code § 21002) A lead agency may not reject an alternative
7 unless the agency makes findings supported by substantial evidence showing that

8 the alternative is infeasible. (Public Resources Code, §§ 21081, 21081.5; State

9 CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15091 (a)(3), 15092.)

10 54. Petitioner and others commented that the County failed to adequately consider

11 alternatives to the proposed Project and failed to make findings, supported by
12 substantial evidence, that alternatives are infeasible.
13 55. For instance, Petitioner notified the County that the EIR should consider a
14 "business park alternative." The Project site is predominantly designated CD-BP
15 which, according to the General Plan, allows for "employee-intensive uses,

16 including research and development, technology centers, corporate and support
17 office uses, clean industry supporting retail uses." Even the portion of the site

18 CD-LI allows "a wide variety of industrial and related uses, including assembly

19 and light manufacturing, repair and other service facilities, warehousing,

20 distribution centers, and supporting retail uses." A "Business Park" designation
21 would act as buffer between Very Low Density Residential uses to the south and

22 west and Light Industrial to the east. Thus, at a minimum, the EIR should have,

23 but did not, evaluate a No Project/ Existing General Plan Designation alternative
24 that would develop a compatible BP land use within this area. Consideration of

25 a BP use in lieu of high-cube warehousing would reduce significant operational

26 effects of the Project, in particular, "land use/planning" impacts, as well as air
27 quality, traffic, and traffic noise due to reduced truck trips and associated NOx

and diesel PM emissions. The exclusion of such an alternative from the EIR was

2 not reasonable.

3 56. The EIR evaluated a "Building D Only Alternative" that has been shown to
reduce significant impacts and was identified in the EIR as the environmentally

5 superior alternative. The EIR indicates that the Building D Only Alternative

6 satisfies, in whole or in part, all of the Project objectives. However, the County's
findings of infeasibility regarding the alternative are not based on substantial

8 evidence as required. As a result, the approval of the Project was in error.
57. For these reasons, the County violated CEQA and the Project approvals must be

10 set aside. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1085, 1094.5; Public Resources Code § 21168.)

11 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

12 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays the following relief on all causes of action:

13 a) For the Court's peremptory writ of mandate requiring Respondent,

14 County of Riverside, to set aside its decision certifying the EIR for the
15 Project.

16 b) For the Court's peremptory writ of mandate requiring Respondent,

17 County of Riverside, to set aside all Project approvals.
18 c) For such other and further relief, including preliminary and permanent
19 injunctive relief, in the event that a Real Party in Interest, or its agents or

20 instrumentalities, intend to commence construction on the site while this
21 lawsuit is pending.

22 d) For such other relief as may be just and proper.
23 e) For the costs of this suit, including attorney's fees, pursuant to Code of

24 Civil Procedure $ 1021.5.
