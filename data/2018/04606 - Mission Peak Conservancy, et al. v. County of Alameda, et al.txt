28 County made the determination(s) that CEQA does not apply, despite overwhelming evidence to

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 2

1 the contrary. Petitioners also challenge the County's issuance of Building Permit Number
2 BLD2017-02969 on November 21, 2017, Building Permit Number BLD2018-01508, issued on

3 May 8, 2018, and all other permits the County issued for the George Ranch Project, without

4 complying with CEQA provisions.

5 3. Petitioners request this Court to vacate, set aside, rescind and void all of the

6 actions, resolutions, decisions and findings of the County that the George Ranch Project and/or

7 any portions thereof, are not subject to CEQA compliance, including rescinding any

8 authorizations to proceed with construction, and any findings that the George Ranch Project

9 and/or any portions thereof, are exempt from CEQA. Petitioners also request this Court order

10 the County to undertake : CEQA review of the George Ranch Project as a whole, including, but

11 not limited to, all the structures, alterations to land, and alterations to waterways listed in section

12 (1.) above.

13 4. The County has been investigating code and permit violations related to the

14 George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof since at least December 2016, and has stated that

15 decisions regarding CEQA review depends upon what their investigation uncovers. As of the

16 date of this filing, the County has not issued any Notice of Exemption or other public notice

17 related to the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof and the applicability of CEQA

18 review. Petitioners are informed and believe that any decisions or findings made by the County

19 a as a part of its ongoing investigation of the George Ranch Project, which includes the

20 applicability of CEQA compliance and any exemptions to the same, such decisions or findings

21 have been made in the last 180 days.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 3

1 feet long gas line, both for the George Ranch Project, without CEQA compliance. There are at

2 least 10 separate major alterations to land and structures that make up the George Ranch Project,

3 and all of them Petitioners are informed and believe are or were the subjects of the County's
code and permit investigation and whether CEQA compliance is required. The County issued

5 permits for only one other structure or alteration for the George Ranch Project on or about

6 August 2014, and November 8, 2017, for a building known as the "Ag Barn" or the "mini palace

7 of Versailles", as dubbed by the County. Despite the issuance of the permits on the "mini palace

8 of Versailles". Petitioners are informed and believed this structure is or was one of the subjects

9 of the County's ongoing investigation and code enforcement action, and its determination of

10 whether CEQA review is or was required for the Ag Barn.

11 7. Petitioner seeks Peremptory Writ of Mandate under California Code of Civil

12 Procedure § 1085, directing Respondents to vacate, rescind and set aside all George Ranch

13 Project approvals, including but not limited to all permits related to the "mini palace of

14 Versailles" and the plaza courtyard, to vacate, rescind and set aside all the County's

19 Ranch Project, including all portions thereof.

10 administrative body in the County and is charged with the duty of ensuring, among other things,

11 that all applicable, federal, state and county laws are fully and faithfully obeyed and

12 implemented. Respondents, through the Board of Supervisors, Community Development

13 Agency, Building Inspection Department, Fire Department, Department of Environmental

14 Health, and Public Works Agency, authorized construction of various portions of the George

15 Ranch Project without CEQA compliance. However, these permitted portions of the George

16 Ranch Project are currently the subject of Respondents' ongoing code and permit enforcement

17 action, which includes whether CEQA applies. Non-permitted structures and alterations

18 comprising the George Ranch Project are also the subject of Respondents' code and permit
19 enforcement actions, including whether CEQA applies. Petitioners are informed and believe and

20 thereon allege that Respondents have made their findings as to whether an exemption to CEQA

21 applies to the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof, but have not and will not notify the

22 public of said findings.

23 13. Real Parties in Interest Christopher George and Teresa George are individuals and

24 the owners of George Ranch, and the proponents of the George Ranch Project and any and all

25 portions thereof.

3 and capacities when ascertained.

4 15. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that at all times material

5 hereto, cach DOE Respondent named in this Petition was the agent and employee of each of the

6 other Respondents herein, and was at all times material thereto, acting within the course and
scope of the agencies and the employment and with the permission and consent of Respondents.

8 JURISDICTION, VENUE AND EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

9 16. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to § 1085 of the California

10 Code of Civil Procedure, and §§ 21168 and 21168.5 of the California Public Resources Code.

11 17. Venue is proper in Alameda County under §§ 394 and-305 of the California Code

16 Respondents prior to filing this Petition. A true and correct copy of the Notice is attached hereto

17 as Exhibit A and incorporated herein by this reference.

18 19. Respondents' findings that the George Ranch Project and/or any portions thereof

19 are not subject to CEQA compliance, and their actions in failing to conduct such CEQA review

20 of the George Ranch Project and/or any portions thereof, constitutes prejudicial abuse of

21 discretion because, as alleged in this Petition, Respondents failed to proceed in the manner
22 required by law, failed to make mandatory findings, and/or made findings not supported by

23 substantial evidence. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, adequate remedy at law and, along with

24 members of the public, will suffer irreparable a harm as a result of Respondents' violations of

25 CEQA as set forth herein.

26 20. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of California Public Resources

27 Code section 21167.7, and California Code of Civil Procedure section 388, by mailing a copy of

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 6

1

1 Pleadings on the Attorney General is attached hereto as Exhibit B and incorporated herein by this

2 reference.

21. California Code of Civil Procedure § 21177 regarding the exhaustion of remedies

4 requirement that must be satisfied in order to maintain this action does not apply to Petitioners in

5 accordance with subsection (e), which states "This section does not apply to any alleged grounds

6 for noncompliance with this division for which there was no public hearing or other opportunity

7 for members of the public to raise those objections orally or in writing prior to the approval of

8 the project, or if the public agency failed to give the notice required by law." (Code of Civil
9| Procedure § 21777(e).) Respondents have held no public hearings or issued any public notice

10 regarding CEQA review of the George Ranch Project and/or any portion thereof.

11 22. This petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section

12 21167 and Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations, section 15112. As a part of its code

13 and permit enforcement action regarding the George Ranch Project and/or any portions thereof

14 that has been ongoing since at least November 2017, Petitioners are informed and believe and

15 thercon alleges the County has made determinations, decisions and/or findings that the George

16 Ranch Project and/or portions thereof, both the unpermitted and permitted work, are exempt

17 from CEQA review, and that such determinations, decisions and/or findings have been made

18 within the past 180 days.

19 STANDING

20 23. Petitioners have standing as a party beneficially interested in the issuance of the

21 requested writ of mandate because the George Ranch Project, and/or portions thereof, as alleged

22 more specifically herein, will have significant adverse environmental impacts affecting the

23 individuals named herein as well as the general public. Petitioners have a beneficial interest in

24 Respondents' fulfillment of all their legal duties, as alleged in this pleading. The significant

25 adverse environmental impacts include, but are not limited to, increased traffic and safety issues,

26 habitat and waterway destruction, development of structures and parking on agricultural land,

27 and the exploitation of groundwater resources for gatherings, assemblies and the production of

28 beer or wine.

PETITION FOR WRIY OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 7

CEQA REQUIREMENTS

24. Respondents are subject to the requirements of CEQA when evaluating a project

3 that may have a significant eftect on the environment. The George Ranch Project is a "project,"
and/or the portions thereof a part of "project," as that term is defined by CEQA, such that it is

5 an "an activity which may cause either a direct physical change in the environment, or a

6 reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment", and which is "[a]n activity

7 that involves the issuance to a person of a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement

8 for use by one or more public agencies." (California Public Resources Code § 21065.)

9 25. CEQA requires governmental authorities, such as Respondents, to fully evaluate

10 potential environmental effects of projects, and to seek feasible means to reduce or avoid

11 significant environmental damage that otherwise could result from their actions. CEQA limits

12 agencies from approving projects with significant adverse impacts when feasible alternatives can

13 substantially lessen such impacts.

14 26. CEQA also requires governmental authorities, such as Respondents, to evaluate

15 the cnvironmental impacts of The George Ranch Project of "the whole of an action". (California

16 Code of Regulations § 15378(A).) Under CEQA, Respondents must analyze the environmental

17 impacts of all reasonably foreseeable portions of the George Ranch Project and cannot separate a

18 larger project into smaller ones such that each individually has a lesser environmental impact

19 than the whole together, thus ignoring the impact of the George Ranch Project as a whole.

20 27. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that Respondents, in

21 making their findings that CEQA review does not apply to the George Ranch Project and/or

22 portions thereof, have impermissibly and separately analyzed the 12,000 square foot "ag barn,"

23 the courtyard, the lake, the dam, the beach, the parking lot(s), the 5,000 square foot barn, and the

24 gazebo that make up the George Ranch Project, as separate individual projects.

25 28. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that Respondents have

26 determined that exemptions apply individually to each portion of the entire George Ranch

27 Project, versus determining whether CEQA applies to the George Ranch Project as a whole.

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 8

1 29. Had the County analyzed whether CEQA applies to the whole of the George
2 Ranch Project, substantial evidence would have led to the undeniable conclusion that replacing a
3 barn with a "mini Palace of Versailles" complete with a plaza courtyard, expanding a cattle
4 stockpond into a lake with an artificial white-sand beach on the north side, damming the
5 watercourse (stream) to create the lake, grading the former rolling pastureland into parking lot(s)
6 with space for 100 cars, and erecting barn with a brewery or a workshop and storage shed for
antique, steam-powered farm equipment, would create and has created significant and multiple
8 environmental impacts more than sufficient to trigger CEQA review and a report a on the same.
30. The County has not undertaken a legally mandated CEQA review to evaluate the
10 potential environmental effects of the George Ranch Project, has not prepared an environmental
11 impact report, or a negative a declaration. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege
12 that the County has erroneously determined the George Ranch Project and/or the portions thereofl
13 are exempt from CEQA review and reporting, despite the substantial evidence to the contrary.
14 31. Categorical exemptions to CEQA review, however, do not apply to the George
15 Ranch Project and/or any portion thereof.

16 32. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the County
17 determined the structures and alterations that make up the George Ranch Project are exempt
18 individually based on certain categorical exemptions, including, but not limited to:
19 California Code of Regulations § 15302 - "replacement or reconstruction of
20 existing structures and facilities where the new structure will be located on the
21 same site as the structure replaced and will have substantially the same purpose
22 and capacity as the structure replaced."

23 California Code of Regulations § 15304 - Class 4 "minor public or private
24 alterations in the condition of land, water, and/or vegetation which do not involve
25 removal of healthy, mature, scenic trees except for forestry or agricultural
26 purposes."

27 California Code of Regulations § 15303 Class 3 "construction and location of
28 limited numbers of new, small facilities or structures; installation of small new

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 9

1 equipment and facilities in small structures; and the conversion of existing small
2 structures from one use to another where only minor modifications are made in
3 the exterior of the structure."

33. The mini Versailles, although placed on the same space where the old barn was
located, does not have "substantially the same purpose and capacity as the structure replaced."
(California Code of Regulations § 15302.)

7 34. The lake, the dam, the parking lot and the beach are not "minor public or private
8 alterations in the condition of land, water, and/or vegetation which do not involve removal of
9 healthy, mature, scenic trees except for forestry or agricultural purposes." (California Code of
10 Regulations 8 15304 §

11 35. The gazebo, the plaza courtyard and the 5,000 square foot barn are not "limited
12 numbers of new, small facilities or structures". (California Code of Regulations § 15303.)
13 36. Not only do the individual projects of the whole George Ranch Project meet the
14 requirements of any categorical exemptions, but when taken together with the whole of the
15 project as CEQA requires, the likelihood of a significant impact on the environment is patently
16 obvious.

17 37. Furthermore, there are exceptions to the categorical exemptions under CEQA.
18 California Code of Regulations § 15300.2(b) and (c), state:
19 (b) Cumulative Impact. All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the
20 cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is
21 significant.

22 (c) Significant Effect. A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where
23 there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the
24 environment due to unusual circumstances. (California Code of Regulations §
25 15300.2(b) and (c), emphasis added.)

26 38. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that if any exemptions do
27 apply to the George Ranch Project, which Petitioners deny, these exceptions to the exemptions
28 preclude the County from relying on the exemptions to foreclose CEQA review and reporting.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 10

F 39. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that no exemptions under
2 CEQA apply to the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof, and challenge Respondents'
3 findings to the contrary.
D THE GEORGE RANCH PROJECT
5 40. The George Ranch Project sits upon an approximate 700 acre spread of land in the
6 Sunol Hills east of Fremont, near the Vargus Plateau Regional Park owned by the East Bay
7 Regional Park District. This land was traditionally an agricultural area, and included a small and
8 seasonal cattle pond and stream, two barns, each over a hundred 100 years old, and a small
9 residential home. The road leading up to the George Ranch Project, Morrison Canyon Road, is a
10 narrow and hazardous road. Petitioners have complained to the County about the dangerous
11 condition of this road, especially when traffic volume is high to and from George Ranch.
12 41. Over the past 10-15 years, Mr. and Mrs. George, real parties in interest, have
13 made, are currently making, or intend to make substantial alterations to the land that may have or
14 have had a significant effect on the environment, as well as the construction of many buildings,
15 as a parl of the George Ranch Project, including the following:
16 a. The construction of a 12,000 square foot "barn" which is an entertainment
17 facility that can accommodate large assemblies of people;
18 b. The creation of a six million gallon lake and dam to stop/alter the flow of
19 the watercourse in violation of Alameda County Municipal Code Section
20 13.12.090b;

21 c. The creation of a white-sand beach alongside the lake;
22 d. The construction of : 5,000 square foot barn;
23 e. The construction of a 2,000 square foot greenhouse;
24 f. The construction of a large gazebo;
25 g. The construction of a mobile/manufactured home;
26 h. The excavation and grading of a hill for parking for up to 100 cars;
27 i. The installation of winery or brewery inside the 5,000 square foot barn;
28 and the advertised production of beer on the properties

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 11

1 j. The construction of a plaza courtyard containing a water fall, fireplace,

2 and retaining walls.

3 k. The installation of a 500 feet gas line (collectively, "the George Ranch

4 Project").

5 42. Of all these sub-projects of the George Ranch Project, The County has issued

6 permits only for the construction of the 12,000 foot "barn," also known as the "mini palace of

7 Versailles" per the County, for the plaza courtyard on the west side of it, and gas line installation.

8 Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege Mr. and Mrs. George did not seek or

9 obtain permits at the time of the construction and creation of the lake, the dam, the beach, the

10 parking lot, the brewery, the greenhouse, the gazebo or the other 5,000 square foot barn.

11 43. None of these sub-projects of the George Ranch Project have undergone any

12 CEQA review by the County, nor has the County held any public hearings or provided any

13 public notice as to any decision or findings it has made with regard to the applicability of CEQA

14 review of the George Ranch Project and/or any portions thereof.

15 44. The 12,000 square foot multi-story "barn" has a 2,000 square foot deck, radiant

16 in-floor heating, copper roofing, dormers and cupolas, 400 amp electrical service, a large septic

17 system, restrooms with disability access, an elevator, panic hardware on the exit doors suitable

18 for large gatherings of people, a sprinkler system, a groundwater treatment system for the

19 production of beer and wine, two walk-in refrigerators for the storage of kegs of beer and barrels

20 of wine, and class IV heavy-frame timber suitable for an entertainment facility that can

21 accommodate large groups of people. The barn this facility demolished and replaced was 100

22 years old, and appeared to be a barn in the traditional sense of the word - typical size and typical

23 appearance of a barn.

24 45. The cattle stockpond was expanded into the six-million gallon lake, replete with

25 the white sand beach and a large gazebo with masonry/stone exterior. The watercourse leading

26 to the stockpond was cut off completely by the earthen embankment dam in violation of

27 Alameda County Municipal Code Section 13.12.090, which prohibits such work absent a permit

28 approved by the Director of Public Works for the County. This sections states:

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 12

1 "No person shall commit or cause to be committed any of the
2 following acts, unless a written permit has first been obtained from
3 the director of public works:

4 A. Discharge into or connect any pipe or channel to a watercourse;
B. Modify the natural flow of water in a watercourse; a
C. Carry out development within a setback, as defined in Article V
of this chapter;

8 D. Deposit in, plant in, or remove any material from a watercourse
including its banks, except as required for necessary maintenance;
10 E. Construct, alter, enlarge, connect to, change, or remove any 2N structure a in a watercourse; or
F. Place any loose or unconsolidated material along the side of or
13 within a watercourse or so close to the side as to cause a diversion
14 of the flow, or to cause a probability of such material being carried
15 away by stormwaters passing through said watercourse."
16 (Alameda County Municipal Code Section 13.12.090)
17 Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege Mr. and Mrs. George violated
1.8 sections B, D, E, and F of the above ordinance, and Respondents violated CEQA in failing to
19 order CEQA compliance for the dam, lake and beach as a part of its code and permit
20 enforcement action.

21 46. A low hill in between the 12,000 square foot "barn" and the lake was graded and
22 excavated to a flat surface that provides parking for up to 100 cars, and displaced approximately
23 1,200 cubic yards of earth.

24 47. The 5,000 square foot barn is a not a barn in the traditional sense, but Petitioners
25 are informed and believe and thereon allege it is or has been used for brewing beer and restoring,
26 repairing, and storing antique steam-powered farm equipment and tractors. Mr. George
27 announced and advertised that beer had been produced at the George Ranch as of 2013-2015.
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJONCTIVE RELIEF - 13

1 48. Petitioners are informed and believe that the courtyard plaza with its waterfall,
2 fireplace and 13-foot high retaining walls, is currently being built on the west side of the 12,000

3 square foot "mini palace of Versailles".

49. All in all, the George is Ranch Project is transforming the formerly traditional ranch
and farm property into a large resort-style entertainment and event facility, all done without any

6 CEQA review, with almost no permits issued, with almost no planning review, with no zoning
7 review nor zoning adjustment by the East County Board of Zoning Adjustment, and with no
8 consideration of the traffic and safety issues it presents on Morrison Canyon Road.

9 50. Ironically, Mr. George shared or shares Petitioners' concerns with traffic and
1.0 safety on Morrison Canyon Road, and raised the same in two lawsuits he filed in 2008 and 2016
11 against the East Bay Regional Park District ("EBRPD") for CEQA violations with respect to a
12 park located next to (west of) the George Ranch and accessed via Morrison Canyon Road and
13 Vargas Rd.

14 51. In the first lawsuit, Mr. George described Morrison Canyon Road as "a steep,
15 rural residential one-lane road that ranges in width from 10 to 12 feet with no shoulder on what
16 the EBRPD calls Upper Morrison Canyon Road and which contains areas less than 9 feet in
17 width on what the EBRPD calls Lower Morrison Canyon Road. Vargas Road, a portion of which
18 is owned and maintained by the City of Fremont and another portion of which is owned and
19 maintained by the County of Alameda, is a rural residential road, varying in width from
20 approximately 12 to 18 feet. Both roads have sharp horizontal curves and at least one sharp
21 vertical curve, with limited sight distance, and are below City of Fremont standards for
22 residential roads. It has been acknowledged by both EBRPD and the City of Fremont that these
23 roads are substandard." (First Amended Verified Complaint for Petition for Writ of Mandate,
24 Alameda County Superior Court Case No. HG08385193, Jack Balch and Christopher George v.
25 East Bay Regional Parks District (the "George Petition").)

26 52. The George Petition alleged in part:

27 €4. In addition, EBRPD also violated CEQA by:

28

FETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 14

- (A)

2 Failing to assess the environmental effects and related safety issues along

3 Vargas Road and Morrison Canyon Road generated from the Larger Project and

4 the phasing of the Larger Project, including Phase I and any limited opening of
the Park to the public in summer 2008.

5 (B) Failing to adequately assess the traffic and resulting adverse

6

7 environmental impacts and related safety issues along Vargas Road and Morrison

8 Canyon Road from the Larger Project and the phasing of the Larger Project,
including any limited opening of the Park to the public in summer 2008.

9 (C)
10 Failing to adequately assess the parking needs generated by the Larger

11 Project and the phasing of the Larger Project, including any limited opening of the
Park to the public in summer 2008.
12 (D)
13 Failing to undertake a traffic study of Vargas Road and Morrison Canyon

14 Road and instead relying merely on a traffic count on Vargas Road prior to

15 approving the Initial Study and Mitigated Negative Declaration and Land Use

Plan.

16 (E)

17 Delegating to the City of Fremont implementation of unspecified

18 mitigation measures and failing entirely to assess the adverse impacts on County

19 owned portions of Vargas Road and how those will be mitigated.
(F)

20 Failing to adopt: monitoring plan to ensure implementation of mitigation

measures.

21 (G)

22 Failing to respond to ongoing comments by resident neighbors concerning

23 the conditions of Vargas and Morrison Canyon Roads and mitigation necessary to
accommodate additional traffic."

24 53.

25 The George Petition also complained about the parking lot that EBRPD intended

26 to construct at the park, one with 25 spaces and the other with 40 to 60 spaces.
54.

27 Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege a settlement was reached

28 in 2012 in which the EBRPD was required to make certain improvements to Morrison Canyon
Road and limit the parking lot to 25 spaces, but Mr. George and Mr. Balch filed a second lawsuit

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 15

1 in 2016, Balch v. East Bay Regional Park District, Case No. RG16814952, Alameda County of
2 Superior Court, alleging the road improvements were not performed in accordance with the

3 settlement agreement. An April 2017 settlement was reached in the 2016 lawsuit, which called

4 for more road improvements.

5 55. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege the improvements to

6 Morrison Canyon Road made as a result of these lawsuits and settlement agreements amounted

7 to $300,000-$400,000, hardly sufficient to address the multiple, serious substandard road

8 deficiencies and safety hazards alleged by the George Petition, and shared by Petitioners.

9 56. The George Ranch Project also has a parking lot that may accommodate up to 100
10 cars, four times the number of spaces that Mr. George insisted the EBRPD limit its lot.

11 57. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege George Ranch has hosted
12 events with over 40 cars in attendance on multiple occasions in recent years.
13 58. Despite the fact that Morrison Canyon Road and Vargas Roads remain
14 substandard as they were at the time of the filing of the George Petition, Mr. George and the
15 County have claimed and/or determined that CEQA review for the George Ranch Project and/or
16 portions thereof is not required when George Ranch is essentially a park, resort, event facility,
17 brewery and/or winery that is nearly comparable in area, and with many more peak hourly

18 visitors, if not more, than the adjacent East Bay Regional Park he shut down for some of the very
19 same concerns alleged in this Petition, not to mention that the George Ranch has a much larger
20 parking lot. (George Ranch has 700 acres and Vargus Plateau Regional Park has approximately
21 1200 acres.) In other words, the park is subject to vigorous CEQA review, but Mr. George's
22 own "park" is not.

23 THE CODE AND PERMIT ENFORCEMENT ACTION INTO THE GEORGE RANCH

24 PROJECT AND DETERMINATION OF THE APPLICATION OF CEQA

25 59. The County first issued permit number BLD2014-02739 for the foundation of the

26 12,000 square foot "barn" on or about February 6, 2015, and BLD2014-01654 for the

27 construction of the same on or about November 5, 2015. The County issued permit number
28 BLD2014-02024 on or about August 29, 2014 for retaining walls.

PETTTION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 16

60. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege, based on a journalistic

2 investigation arising out of the 2014-2015 Report of the Alameda County Grand Jury, that the

3 permits for the "mini palace of Versailles" were fast-tracked in a highly irregular manner. Prior

4 to their issuance, a qualified professional on the staff of the County Planning Department wrote

5 the following assessment of the George Ranch Project in an email communication dated July 14,

6 2014: "Please do not issue any permits at this time. It's part of a much larger project that does

7 require CEQA and rezoning." Regardless, Respondents authorized the construction of the "mini

8 palace of Versailles," which is not intended for an agricultural purpose, to bypass building

9 review and failed to undertake the CEQA review that is required by law.

10 61. Albert Lopez, Planning Department Director for the County, states in a July 11,

11 2017 internal email, "it came in as a "barn" structure that looked more like a mini palace of

12 Versailles. It was It clearly being planned to be something else a than a barn, so we sent a letter

13 saying if the use changes to something that is not ag related we would send code enforcement. It

14 was the best we could do at the time since the "barn" was legal land use-wise. The structure

15 itself was permitted by BID [Building Inspection Dept] and we signed off on it. We went back

16 and forth on the CEQA process and ultimately determined that since it was being built to replace

17 an existing barn over disturbed area, we exempted it from CEQA."

18 62. The County did in fact engage in a code enforcement action based on "use

19 changes to something not ag related" with respect to the "mini Versailles," which, as of
20 November 14, 2017, was ongoing.

21 63. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon alleges that the County did not

22 issue a Notice of Exemption or other public notice regarding its finding as stated in the

23 November 14, 2017 that the "mini-Versailles" was exempt from CEQA.

24 64. On or about November 8, 2017, the County issued permit BLD2017-03666 to

25 complete the construction of the 12,000 square foot barn, even though it admitted the "barn" wasi

26 no barn, but a "mini palace of Versailles" only four months earlier. On or about November 21,

27 2017, the County issued permit BLD2017-02969 for new construction of a large courtyard with a

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 17

1 waterfall, deck, retaining walls, storage area, gas fire place, and stairs. None of these
2 | authorizations for work and/or construction underwent a CEQA review.

3 65. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege Mr. and Mrs. George did

4 not seek or obtain permits at the time of the construction and creation of the lake, the dam, the

5 beach, the parking lot, the brewery, the greenhouse, the gazebo or the 5,000 square foot "barn".

6 None of these projects underwent a CEQA review.

7 66. Since 2016, Petitioners have complained to the County regarding the George

8 Ranch Project and portions thereof, the use of George Ranch being something other than
| agricultural, and their potential and actual significant negative effects on the environment,

10 including traffic and public safety, and habitat and waterway destruction. Petitioners have

11 demanded CEQA compliance, but to date, Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege

12 that the County has not engaged in CEQA compliance with respect to the George Ranch Project.

13 67. In light of the numerous complaints Petitioners have made regarding the George

14 Ranch Project and its use for purposes other than agricultural, the County engaged in a code and

15 permit enforcement action of the George Ranch Project and portions thereof, including "the

16 ongoing construction of the barn facility as well as discuss [sic] the overall use of the property

17 and any other permits that may need to have been secured by the property owner", according

18 to a November 14, 2017 email to Lawrence Edelson, a member of the Petitioner Mission Peak

19 Conservancy, Shawn Wilson and Chris Bazar, Director of the Community Development

20 Association.

21 68. Mr. Lopez stated in this email that "based on the complaints that we have

22 received, other structures on the property are being looked at as well, and the property owner

23 has met several times with the building department to discuss what he needs to do to bring

24' some of those structures into compliance. This is an ongoing code enforcement case and

25 naturally we are working towards resolution and getting all the buildings on the parcel

26 permitted and up to county code."

27 69. Thus, the 12,000 square foot "barn" had received its initial construction permit in
28 2015 and again on November 8, 2017. But, as of November 14, 2017, only six days later, the

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 18

1 County advises Petitioners that it is involved in a code and permit enforcement action regarding
2 the structure it had already permitted, and those unpermitted structures as well, and to determine

3 whether CEQA review is required of the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof.

9 70. Mr. Lopez stated that "no discretionary permits have been required so far based

5 on the proposed use, and if through the code enforcement process this remains true, then the

6 CEQA process will not be necessary. We have forwarded the concerns related to biological

7 habitat to the appropriate State officials, and are awaiting their response."

8 71. Again, even though the County allegedly determined CEQA was not applicable to

C the 12,000 square foot "mini Versailles" as an existing structure exemption, the County, not later

10 than November 14, 2017, began anew the process to determine whether CEQA applies to said

11 structure as well as the other structures and changes.
12 72. According to this November 14, 2017 email, the County was holding off on any
13 final decisions regarding the applicability of CEQA review of the George Ranch Project and

14 portions thereof, including the "mini-Versailles," pending the results of the code enforcement

15 and permit action and responses from the appropriate State officials. That was approximately six
16 months ago, and Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that any findings made
17 by the County regarding the applicability of CEQA review to the George Ranch Project through
18 its code and permit enforcement action against the same have been made within the past 180

19 days.

20 73. At no time has the County issued a Notice of Exemption or any public notice

21 regarding any findings it has made regarding CEQA review of the George Ranch Project or any

22 portions thereof as a result of their investigation into the same that began no later than November

23 14, 2017. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege the County has determined not
24 to require or conduct a CEQA review of the George Ranch project and any portions thereof,

25 including but not limited to:

26 a. The ongoing construction of a 12,000 square foot "barn";

27 b. The creation of a six million gallon lake and dam to stop flow of the

28 stream;

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 19

C. The creation of a white sand beach alongside the lake;

d. The construction of a 5,000 square foot "barn";

e.

5 The construction of a 2,000 square foot greenhouse;

f. The construction of a large gazebo;

g. The construction of a mobile/manufactured home;

6 h.

7 i. The excavation and grading of pastureland for parking for up to 100 cars;

8 The installation of a brewery and/or a workshop and storage facility for

9 antique steam-powered agricultural equipment inside the 5,000 square foot
barn; and
10 j.
11 The construction of a plaza courtyard containing a water fall, fireplace,
and retaining walls.
12 k.
13 The installation of a 500 feet gas line.

14 Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the County has determined

15 that the George Ranch Project, and/or portions of the same as listed above, are exempt from

16 CEQA review, or do not qualify a as a project under CEQA, within the past 180 days.
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

17

18 Failure to Direct CEQA Review of the George Ranch Project

19 74. The George Ranch Project is a "Project" and No Exemptions Apply

20 Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in
paragraphs through 73 as though fully stated herein.
21 75.

22 Respondents are subject to the requirements of CEQA when evaluating a project

23 a that may have a significant effect on the environment. The George Ranch Project is a "project,"

24 and/or the portions thereof a part of a "project," as that term is defined by CEQA, and has caused

25 and may cause direct physical changes in the environment, and carries the risk of reasonably

26 foreseeable indirect physical changes in the environment. The George Ranch Project and/or any
portions thereof involves or is legally required to involve the County's issuance of permits, the
27 enforcement of permits, and the enforcement of code violations.

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 20

1 76. Unless an exemption applies, or the activity does not meet the definition of a
2 project, CEQA requires governmental authorities, such as Respondents, to fully evaluate
3 potential environmental effects of projects like the George Ranch Project, and to seek feasible
4 means to reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that otherwise could result from
5 their actions. CEQA limits the County from approving projects with significant adverse impacts

6 when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen such impacts.

7 77, Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege the County violated

8 CEQA because it failed to require and direct CEQA review and reporting for the George Ranch

9 Project and/or portions thereof, based on certain exemptions, and/or under the false premise and
10 unsupported assertion that the George Ranch Project does not meet the definition of a "project"

11 under CEQA.

12 78. Categorical exemptions to CEQA review, however, do not apply to the George
13 Ranch Project and/or any portion thereof, as fully described in this Petition, and the George

14 Ranch Project and/or portions thereof, meet the definition of a "project".
15 79. CEQA requires Respondents to evaluate the environmental impacts of the George
16 Ranch Project of "the whole of an action". (California Code of Regulations § 15378(A).)
17 Respondents must analyze the environmental impacts of all reasonably foreseeable portions of
18 the George Ranch Project and cannot separate this larger project into smaller ones such that each
19 individually has a lesser environmental impact than the whole together, thus ignoring the impact

20 of the George Ranch Project as a whole. (Laurel Heights Improvement Association v. Regents
21 of the University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 396.)

22 80. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that Respondents, in
23 making their findings that CEQA review does not apply to the George Ranch Project and/or
24 portions thereof, violated CEQA and have impermissibly and separately analyzed the 12,000
25 square foot "ag barn," the courtyard, the lake, the dam, the beach, the parking lot(s), the 5,000
26 square foot barn, and the gazebo that make up the George Ranch Project, as separate individual
27 projects.

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 21

1 81. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that Respondents have
2 violated CEQA and determined that exemptions apply individually to each portion of the entire
3 George Ranch Project, versus determining whether CEQA applies to the George Ranch Project

4 as a whole, and/or determined that each individual portion of the George Ranch Project are not a

5 "project" subject to CEQA review, as opposed to the George Ranch Project as a whole.
6 82. Had the County analyzed whether CEQA applies to the whole of the George
7 Ranch Project as an official with Planning Dept proposed in July 2014, substantial evidence

8 would have led to the undeniable conclusion that replacing an old barn with a "mini Palace of
Versailles" complete with courtyard plaza, expanding a cattle stockpond into a lake with an
10 artificial white-sand beach on the north side, damming the watercourse (stream) to create the
11 lake, grading the former rolling pastureland into parking lot(s) with space for 100 cars, and 2
12 erecting barn with a brewery or a workshop and storage shed for antique, steam-powered farm
13 equipment, would create and has created significant and multiple environmental impacts more
14 than sufficient to meet the definition of a project to trigger CEQA review and a report on the
15 same.

16 83. Furthermore, there are exceptions to the categorical exemptions under CEQA.
17 California Code of Regulations § 15300.2(b) and (c), state:

18 (b) Cumulative Impact. All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the
19 cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is
20 significant.

21 (c) Significant Effect. A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where
22 there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant a effect on the
23 environment due to unusual circumstances. (California Code of Regulations §
24 15300.2(b) and (c), emphasis added.)

25 84. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that if any exemptions do
26 apply to the George Ranch Project, which Petitioners deny, these exceptions to the exemptions
27 preclude the County from relying on the exemptions to foreclose CEQA review and reporting.
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 22

1 85. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the George Ranch
2 Project and/or portions of the same, both permitted and non-permitted work, are the subject of
3 the County's ongoing code and permit enforcement action (as of November 14, 2017), and the

4 County's determination as to whether CEQA applies.

5 86. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the County violated

6 CEQA and made unlawful findings that the George Ranch Project and/or any portions thereof
7 are not subject to CEQA compliance because of certain exemptions, or because it does not meet

8 the definition of a "project" under CEQA, as a part of its code and permit enforcement action at

9 the George Ranch Project.

10 87. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that no exemptions under
11 CEQA apply to the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof, and challenge Respondents'
12 findings to the contrary as unlawful.

13 88. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the George Ranch
14 Project and all portions thereof, is a "project" under CEQA, and challenge Respondents' findings
15 to the contrary as unlawful.

16 89. Petitioners seek a writ of mandate revoking, rescinding, or voiding any and all
17 decisions, determinations and/or findings of the County that the George Ranch Project, and any
18 portions thereof, are exempt from CEQA compliance.

19 90. Petitioners seek a writ of mandate revoking, rescinding, or voiding any and all
20 decisions, determinations and/or findings of the County that the George Ranch Project, and any
21 portions thereof, do not meet the definition of a "project" under CEQA.

22 91. Petitioners seek a writ of mandate revoking, rescinding, or voiding any and all
23 authorizations for construction of the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof issued by the
24 County in reliance on the County's unlawful findings that CEQA compliance is not required.

25 92. Petitioners are entitled to recover attorneys' fees as provided in Code of Civil

26 Procedure section 1021.5 if they prevail in this action and the Court finds a significant benefit

27 has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons, and that the necessity and
28 burden of private enforcement is such as to make an award of fees appropriate.

4N 073 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
Failure to Conduct CEQA Review of the George Ranch Project
93. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in
paragraphs 1 through 92 as though fully stated herein.

5 94. Respondents are subject to the requirements of CEQA when evaluating a project
6 a that may have a significant effect on the environment. The George Ranch Project is a "project,"
7 and/or the portions thereof a part of a "project," as that term is defined by CEQA, and has caused

8 and may cause direct physical changes in the environment, and carries the risk of reasonably

9 foreseeable indirect physical changes in the environment. The George Ranch Project and/or any
10 portions thereof involves the County's issuance of permits, the enforcement of permits, and the
11 enforcement of code violations.

12 95. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that as a result of
13 Respondents' unlawful findings that the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof are
14 exempt from CEQA and/or are not a "project" under CEQA, Respondents further violated

15 CEQA by failing to conduct and/or prepare an Initial Study and a report on the same.
16 96. Petitioners seek a writ of mandate directing Respondents to comply with CEQA
17 with respect to the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof, and ordering Respondents to
18 prepare and complete an Initial Study under CEQA.

19 97. Petitioners are entitled to recover attorneys' fees as provided in Code of Civil

20 Procedure section 1021.5 if it prevails in this action and the Court finds a significant benefit has
21 been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons, and that the necessity and
22 burden of private enforcement is such as to make an award of fees appropriate.

PEPITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 24

1 99. A dispute and an actual controversy exists between Petitioners and Respondents

2 concerning their rights and duties in that Petitioners contend, and Respondents deny, the
3 following:

4 a. That the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof is a "project" under

5 CEQA;

6 b. That no exemptions apply to permit the County to forgo CEQA review of the
7 George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof, including but not limited to, conducting an Initial

8 Study and preparing a report of the same:

C. That CEQA review of the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof,
10 including but not limited to, conducting an Initial Study and preparing report of the same is
11 required;

12 d. That Petitioners fundamental rights have been violated.

13 100. Petitioners desire a judicial determination of the respective rights and duties of
14 Petitioners and Respondents with respect to CEQA applicability to the George Ranch Project
15 and/or portions thereof

16 101. Such declarations are necessary and appropriate at this time in order that
17 Petitioners and Respondents may ascertain Respondents obligations under CEQA with respect to
18 the George Ranch Project and Petitioners rights.

19 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

20 Injunctive Relief

21 102. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in
22 paragraphs 1 through 101 as though fully stated herein.

23 103. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege Respondents have

24 unlawfully issued authorizations for construction of the George Ranch Project and/or portions

25 thereof in violation of CEQA, and have determined, despite an ongoing investigation into both

26 the permitted and unpermitted work on the George Ranch Project, that CEQA does not apply.
27 Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege the County unlawfully determined the

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 25

1 George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof are exempt from CEQA or do not qualify as a

2 "project".

3 104. Construction of the mini Versailles continues unabated, as does the plaza,

4 Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege the brewing activities continue, and large

5 events continue to be held on a regular basis, using Morrison Canyon Road as access.

105. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege large events, such as

7 weddings, are set to be held at George Ranch this summer.

8 106. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege the damage done to the

9 environment already and 1n the future as a result of the George Ranch Project and/or portions

10 thereof and the illegal uses of the same, will continue unmitigated unless the County and Real

11 Parties in Interest are ordered to halt construction pending a judgment by this Court that CEQA

12 review and reporting is required, to suspend the issuance of any permits for the George Ranch

13 Project and any portion thereof pending a judgment by this Court that CEQA review and

14 reporting is required, and to restrict event use of George Ranch.

15 107. Petitioners demanded and requested that Respondents and Real Parties in Interest

Public Works Agency, and Board of Supervisors ("the County") with respect to the structures

25 Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000, et seq. ("CEQA") with respect to the George

26 Ranch Project and/or any portions thereof, both permitted and non-permitted, including, but not

27 limited to, that are or were the subject(s) of a code and permit enforcement action in which the

28 County made the determination(s) that CEQA does not apply, despite overwhelming evidence to

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 2

1 the contrary. Petitioners also challenge the County's issuance of Building Permit Number
2 BLD2017-02969 on November 21, 2017, Building Permit Number BLD2018-01508, issued on

3 May 8, 2018, and all other permits the County issued for the George Ranch Project, without

4 complying with CEQA provisions.

5 3. Petitioners request this Court to vacate, set aside, rescind and void all of the

6 actions, resolutions, decisions and findings of the County that the George Ranch Project and/or

7 any portions thereof, are not subject to CEQA compliance, including rescinding any

8 authorizations to proceed with construction, and any findings that the George Ranch Project

9 and/or any portions thereof, are exempt from CEQA. Petitioners also request this Court order

10 the County to undertake CEQA review of the George Ranch Project as a whole, including, but

16 date of this filing, the County has not issued any Notice of Exemption or other public notice

17 related to the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof and the applicability of CEQA

18 review. Petitioners are informed and believe that any decisions or findings made by the County

21 have been made in the last 180 days.

27 construction of a massive courtyard, complete with fireplace, waterfall, and retaining walls on

2 least 10 separate major alterations to land and structures that make up the George Ranch Project,

3 and all of them Petitioners are informed and believe are or were the subjects of the County's

4 code and permit investigation and whether CEQA compliance is required. The County issued

5 permits for only one other structure or alteration for the George Ranch Project on or about

6 August 2014, and November 8, 2017, for a building known as the "Ag Barn" or the "mini palace

19 Ranch Project, including all portions thereof.

6 other Respondents herein, and was at all times material thereto, acting within the course and

scope of the agencies and the employment and with the permission and consent of Respondents.

19 are not subject to CEQA compliance, and their actions in failing to conduct such CEQA review

20 of the George Ranch Project and/or any portions thereof, constitutes a prejudicial abuse of

21 discretion because, as alleged in this Petition, Respondents failed to proceed in the manner

22 required by Jaw, failed to make mandatory findings, and/or made findings not supported by

23 substantial evidence. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, adequate remedy at law and, along with

24 members of the public, will suffer irreparable harm as a result of Respondents' violations of

25 CEQA as set forth herein.

26 20. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of California Public Resources

27 Code section 21167.7, and California Code of Civil Procedure section 388, by mailing a copy of

28 the Petition/Complaint to the State Attorney General. A true and correct copy of the Service of

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 6

Pleadings on the Attorney General is attached hereto as Exhibit B and B incorporated herein by this

reference.

21. California Code of Civil Procedure § 21177 regarding the exhaustion of remedies
requirement that must be satisfied in order to maintain this action does not apply to Petitioners in
accordance with subsection (e), which states "This section does not apply to any alleged grounds|

6 for noncompliance with this division for which there was no public hearing or other opportunity

7 for members of the public to raise those objections orally or in writing prior to the approval of

8 the project, or if the public agency failed to give the notice required by law." (Code of Civil

9 Procedure § 21777(e).) Respondents have held no public hearings or issued any public notice

10 regarding CEQA review of the George Ranch Project and/or any portion thereof.

11 22. This petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section

1.2 21167 and Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations, section 15112. As a part of its code

13 and permit enforcement action regarding the George Ranch Project and/or any portions thereof

14 that has been ongoing since at least November 2017, Petitioners are informed and believe and

15 thereon alleges the County has made determinations, decisions and/or findings that the George

16 Ranch Project and/or portions thereof, both the unpermitted and permitted work, are exempt

17 from CEQA review, and that such determinations, decisions and/or findings have been made

18 within the past 180 days.

19 STANDING

20 23. Petitioners have standing as a party beneficially interested in the issuance of the

21 requested writ of mandate because the George Ranch Project, and/or portions thereof, as alleged

22 more specifically herein, will have significant adverse environmental impacts affecting the

23 individuals named herein as well as the general public. a Petitioners have a beneficial interest in

24 Respondents' fulfillment of all their legal duties, as alleged in this pleading. The significant

25 adverse environmental impacts include, but are not limited to, increased traffic and safety issues,
26 habitat and waterway destruction, development of structures and parking on agricultural land,

27 and the exploitation of groundwater resources for gatherings, assemblies and the production of

28 beer or wine.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 7

1 CEQA REQUIREMENTS

2 24. Respondents are subject to the requirements of CEQA when evaluating a project

3 that may have a significant eftect on the environment. The George Ranch Project is a "project,"

4 and/or the portions thereof a part of a "project," as that term is defined by CEQA, such that it is

5 an "an activity which may cause either a direct physical change in the environment, or a

6 reasonably foresecable indirect physical change in the environment", and which is "[a]n activity

7 that involves the issuance to a person of a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement

8 for use by one or more public agencies.* (California Public Resources Code § 21065.)

9 25. CEQA requires governmental authorities, such as Respondents, to fully evaluate

10 potential environmental effects of projects, and to seek feasible means to reduce or avoid

11 significant environmental damage that otherwise could result from their actions. CEQA limits

12 agencies from approving projects with significant adverse impacts when feasible alternatives can

13 substantially lessen such impacts.

14 26. CEQA also requires governmental authorities, such as Respondents, to evaluate

15 the environmental impacts of The George Ranch Project of "the whole of an action". (California

16 Code of Regulations § 15378(A).) Under CEQA, Respondents must analyze the environmental

17 impacts of all reasonably foreseeable portions of the George Ranch Project and cannot separate a

18 larger project into smaller ones such that each individually has a lesser environmental impact

19 than the whole together, thus ignoring the impact of the George Ranch Project as a whole.

20 27. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that Respondents, in

21 making their findings that CEQA review does not apply to the George Ranch Project and/or

22 portions thereof, have impermissibly and separately analyzed the 12,000 square foot "ag barn,"

23 the courtyard, the lake, the dam, the beach, the parking lot(s), the 5,000 square foot barn, and the

24 gazebo that make up the George Ranch Project, as separate individual projects.

25 28. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that Respondents have

26 determined that exemptions apply individually to each portion of the entire George Ranch

27 Project, versus determining whether CEQA applies to the George Ranch Project as a whole.

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 8

29. Had the County analyzed whether CEQA applies to the whole of the George

2 Ranch Project, substantial evidence would have led to the undeniable conclusion that replacing a
barn with a "mini Palace of Versailles" complete, with a plaza courtyard, expanding a cattle

4 stockpond into a lake with an artificial white-sand beach on the north side, damming the

5 watercourse (stream) to create the lake, grading the former rolling pastureland into parking lot(s)

6 with space for 100 cars, and erecting a barn with a brewery or a workshop and storage shed for

7 antique, steam-powered farm equipment, would create and has created significant and multiple

8 environmental impacts more than sufficient to trigger CEQA review and a report on the same.
30. The County has not undertaken a legally mandated CEQA review to evaluate the

10 potential environmental effects of the George Ranch Project, has not prepared an environmental

11 impact report, or a negative declaration. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege

12 that the County has erroneously determined the George Ranch Project and/or the portions thereof

13 are exempt from CEQA review and reporting, despite the substantial evidence to the contrary.

14 31. Categorical exemptions to CEQA review, however, do not apply to the George

15 Ranch Project and/or any portion thereof.

16 32. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the County

17 determined the structures and alterations that make up the George Ranch Project are exempt

18 individually based on certain categorical exemptions, including, but not limited to:

19 California Code of Regulations § 15302 - "replacement or reconstruction of

20 existing structures and facilities where the new structure will be located on the

21 same site as the structure replaced and will have substantially the same purpose

22 and capacity as the structure replaced."

23 California Code of Regulations § 15304 -- Class 4 "minor public or private

24 alterations in the condition of land, water, and/or vegetation which do not involve

25 removal of healthy, mature, scenic trees except for forestry or agricultural

26 purposes."

27 California Code of Regulations § 15303 - Class 3 "construction and location of

28 limited numbers of new, small facilities or structures; installation of small new

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 9

equipment and facilities in small structures; and the conversion of existing small

2 structures from one use to another where only minor modifications are made in

3 the exterior of the structure."

4 33. The mini Versailles, although placed on the same space where the old barn was

5 located, does not have "substantially the same purpose and capacity as the structure replaced."

6 (California Code of Regulations § 15302.)

7 34. The lake, the dam, the parking lot and the beach are not "minor public or private

8 alterations in the condition of land, water, and/or vegetation which do not involve removal of
healthy, mature, scenic trees except for forestry or agricultural purposes." (California Code of

10 Regulations § 15304

11 35. The gazebo, the plaza courtyard and the 5,000 square foot barn are not "limited

12 numbers of new, small facilities or structures". (California Code of Regulations § 15303.)

13 36. Not only do the individual projects of the whole George Ranch Project meet the

14 requirements of any categorical exemptions, but when taken together with the whole of the

15 project as CEQA requires, the likelihood of a significant impact on the environment is patently

16 obvious.

17 37. Furthermore, there are exceptions to the categorical exemptions under CEQA.

18 California Code of Regulations § 15300.2(b) and (c), state:

19 (b) Cumulative Impact. All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the

20 cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is

21 significant.

22 (c) Significant Effect. A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where

23 there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the

24 environment due to unusual circumstances. (California Code of Regulations §

25 15300.2(b) and (c), emphasis added.)

26 38. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that if any exemptions do

27 apply to the George Ranch Project, which Petitioners deny, these exceptions to the exemptions

28 preclude the County from relying on the exemptions to foreclose CEQA review and reporting.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 10

1 39. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that no exemptions under

2 CEQA apply to the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof, and challenge Respondents'

3 findings to the contrary.

4 THE GEORGE RANCH PROJECT

5 40. The George Ranch Project sits upon an approximate 700 acre spread of land in the

6 Sunol Hills east of Fremont, near the Vargus Plateau Regional Park owned by the East Bay
Regional Park District. This land was traditionally an agricultural area, and included a small and

8 seasonal cattle pond and stream, two barns, each over a hundred 100 years old, and a small
residential home. The road leading up to the George Ranch Project, Morrison Canyon Road, is a

10 narrow and hazardous road. Petitioners have complained to the County about the dangerous

11 condition of this road, especially when traffic volume is high to and from George Ranch.

12 41. Over the past 10-15 years, Mr. and Mrs. George, real parties in interest, have

13 made, are currently making, or intend to make substantial alterations to the land that may have or

14 have a had a significant effect on the environment, as well as the construction of many buildings,

15 a as a part of the George Ranch Project, including the following:

16 a. The construction of a 12,000 square foot "barn" which is an entertainment

17 facility that can accommodate large assemblies of people;

18 b. The creation of a six million gallon lake and dam to stop/alter the flow of

19 the watercourse in violation of Alameda County Municipal Code Section

20 13.12.090b;

21 C. The creation of a white-sand beach alongside the lake;

22 d. The construction of a 5,000 square foot barn;

23 €. The construction of a 2,000 square foot greenhouse;

24 f. The construction of a large gazebo;

25 g. The construction of a mobile/manufactured home;

26 h. The excavation and grading of a hill for parking for up to 100 cars;

27 •- The installation of a winery or brewery inside the 5,000 square foot barn;

28 and the advertised production of beer on the properties

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATI AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 11

1 j. The construction of a plaza courtyard containing a water fall, fireplace,

2 and retaining walls.

3 k. The installation of a 500 feet gas line (collectively, "the George Ranch

4 Project").

5 42. Of all these sub-projects of the George Ranch Project, The County has issued

6 permits only for the construction of the 12,000 foot "barn," also known as the "mini palace of

7 Versailles" per the County, for the plaza courtyard on the west side of it, and gas line installation.
8| Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege Mr. and Mrs. George did not seek or

9 obtain permits at the time of the construction and creation of the lake, the dam, the beach, the

10 parking lot, the brewery, the greenhouse, the gazebo or the other 5,000 square foot barn.

11 43. None of these sub-projects of the George Ranch Project have undergone any

12 CEQA review by the County, nor has the County held any public hearings or provided any

13 public notice as to any decision or findings it has made with regard to the applicability of CEQA

14 review of the George Ranch Project and/or any portions thereof.

15 44. The 12,000 square foot multi-story "barn" has a 2,000 square foot deck, radiant

16 in-floor heating, copper roofing, dormers and cupolas, 400 amp electrical service, a large septic

17 system, restrooms with disability access, an elevator, panic hardware on the exit doors suitable

18 for large gatherings of people, a sprinkler system, a groundwater treatment system for the

19 production of beer and wine, two walk-in refrigerators for the storage of kegs of beer and barrels

20 of wine, and class IV heavy-frame timber suitable for an entertainment facility that can

21 accommodate large groups of people. The barn this facility demolished and replaced was 100

22 years old, and appeared to be a barn in the traditional sense of the word -- typical size and typical

23 appearance of a barn.

24 45. The cattle stockpond was expanded into the six-million gallon lake, replete with

25 the white sand beach and a large gazebo with a masonry/stone exterior. The watercourse leading

26 to the stockpond was cut off completely by the earthen embankment dam in violation of

27 Alameda County Municipal Code Section 13.12.090, which prohibits such work absent a permit

28 approved by the Director of Public Works for the County. This sections states:

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 12

1 "No person shall commit or cause to be committed any of the
2 following acts, unless a written permit has first been obtained from
3 the director of public works:
4 A. Discharge into or connect any pipe or channel to a watercourse;
5 B. Modify the natural flow of water in a watercourse;
6 C. Carry out development within a setback, as defined in Article V
7 of this chapter;

8 D. Deposit in, plant in, or remove any material from a watercourse
9 including its banks, except as required for necessary maintenance;
10 E. Construct, alter, enlarge, connect to, change, or remove any
11 structure in a watercourse; or
12 F. Place any loose or unconsolidated material along the side of or
13 within a watercourse or so close to the side as to cause a diversion a
14 of the flow, or to cause a probability of such material being carried
15 away by stormwaters passing through said watercourse."
16 (Alameda County Municipal Code Section 13.12.090)
17 Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege Mr. and Mrs. George violated 18 sections B, D, E, and F of the above ordinance, and Respondents violated CEQA in failing to
19 order CEQA compliance for the dam, lake and beach as a part of its code and permit
20 enforcement action.

21 46. A low hill in between the 12,000 square foot "barn" and the lake was graded and 22 excavated to a flat surface that provides parking for up to 100 cars, and displaced approximately
23 1,200 cubic yards of earth.

24 47. The 5,000 square foot barn is not a barn in the traditional sense, but Petitioners
25 are informed and believe and thereon allege it is or has been used for brewing beer and restoring, 26 repairing, and storing antique steam-powered farm equipment and tractors. Mr. George
27 announced and advertised that beer had been produced at the George Ranch as of 2013-2015.
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 13

48. Petitioners are informed and believe that the courtyard plaza with its waterfall,

2 fireplace and 13-foot high retaining walls, is currently being built on the west side of the 12,000

3 square foot "mini palace of Versailles".

4 49. All in all, the George Ranch Project is transforming the formerly traditional ranch

5 and farm property into a large resort-style entertainment and event facility, all done without any

6 CEQA review, with almost no permits issued, with almost no planning review, with no zoning

7 review nor zoning adjustment by the East County Board of Zoning Adjustment, and with no

8 consideration of the traffic and safety issues it presents on Morrison Canyon Road. it

9 50. Ironically, Mr. George shared or shares Petitioners' concerns with traffic and

10 safety on Morrison Canyon Road, and raised the same in two lawsuits he filed in 2008 and 2016

11 against the East Bay Regional Park District ("EBRPD") for CEQA violations with respect to a

12 park located next to (west of) the George Ranch and accessed via Morrison Canyon Road and

13 Vargas Rd.

14 51. In the first lawsuit, Mr. George described Morrison Canyon Road as "a steep,

15 rural residential one-lane road that ranges in width from 10 to 12 feet with no shoulder on what

16 the EBRPD calls Upper Morrison Canyon Road and which contains areas less than 9 feet in

17 width on what the EBRPD calls Lower Morrison Canyon Road. Vargas Road, a portion of which

18 is owned and maintained by the City of Fremont and another portion of which is owned and
19 maintained by the County of Alameda, is a rural residential road, varying in width from
20 approximately 12 to 18 feet. Both roads have sharp horizontal curves and at least one sharp

21 vertical curve, with limited sight distance, and are below City of Fremont standards for

22 residential roads. It has been acknowledged by both EBRPD and the City of Fremont that these

23 roads are substandard." (First Amended Verified Complaint for Petition for Writ of Mandate,

24 Alameda County Superior Court Case No. HG08385193, Jack Balch and Christopher George v.

25 East Bay Regional Parks District (the "George Petition").)

26 52. The George Petition alleged in part:

27 €4. In addition, EBRPD also violated CEQA by:

28

FETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 14

L (A) Failing to assess the environmental effects and related safety issues along
2 Vargas Road and Morrison Canyon Road generated from the Larger Project and
3 the phasing of the Larger Project, including Phase I and any limited opening of

4 the Park to the public in summer 2008.

5 (B) Failing to adequately assess the traffic and resulting adverse

6 environmental impacts and related safety issues along Vargas Road and Morrison
7 Canyon Road from the Larger Project and the phasing of the Larger Project,
8 including any limited opening of the Park to the public in summer 2008.

9 (C) Failing to adequately assess the parking needs generated by the Larger
10 Project and the phasing of the Larger Project, including any limited opening of the
11 Park to the public in summer 2008.
12 (D) Failing to undertake a traffic study of Vargas Road and Morrison Canyon
3 Road and instead relying merely on a traffic count on Vargas Road prior to
14 approving the Initial Study and Mitigated Negative Declaration and Land Use
15 Plan.

16 (E) Delegating to the City of Fremont implementation of unspecified
17 mitigation measures and failing entirely to assess the adverse impacts on County
18 owned portions of Vargas Road and how those will be mitigated.
19 (F) Failing to adopt a monitoring plan to ensure implementation of mitigation
20 measures.

21 (G) Failing to respond to ongoing comments by resident neighbors concerning
22 the conditions of Vargas and Morrison Canyon Roads and mitigation necessary to
23 accommodate additional traffic."

24 53. The George Petition also complained about the parking lot that EBRPD intended
25 to construct at the park, one with 25 spaces and the other with 40 to 60 spaces.
26 54. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege a settlement was reached
27 in 2012 in which the EBRPD was required to make certain improvements to Morrison Canyon
28 Road and limit the parking lot to 25 spaces, but Mr. George and Mr. Balch filed a second a lawsuit

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 15

1 in 2016, Balch v. East Bay Regional Park District, Case No. RG16814952, Alameda County of
Superior Court, alleging the road improvements were not performed in accordance with the

3 settlement agreement. An April 2017 settlement was reached in the 2016 lawsuit, which called

4 for more road improvements.

55. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege the improvements to

6 Morrison Canyon Road made as a result of these lawsuits and settlement agreements amounted
to $300,000-$400,000, hardly sufficient to address the multiple, serious substandard road
deficiencies and safety hazards alleged by the George Petition, and shared by Petitioners.

9 56. The George Ranch Project also has a parking lot that may accommodate up to 100

10 cars, four times the number of spaces that Mr. George insisted the EBRPD limit its lot.

11 57. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege George Ranch has hosted

12 events with over 40 cars in attendance on multiple occasions in recent years.

13 58. Despite the fact that Morrison Canyon Road and Vargas Roads remain

14 substandard as they were at the time of the filing of the George Petition, Mr. George and the

15 County have claimed and/or determined that CEQA review for the George Ranch Project and/or

16 portions thereof is not required when George Ranch is essentially a park, resort, event facility,

17 brewery and/or winery that is nearly comparable in area, and with many more peak hourly

18 visitors, if not more, than the adjacent East Bay Regional Park he shut down for some of the very

19 same concerns alleged in this Petition, not to mention that the George Ranch has a much larger

20 parking lot. (George Ranch has 700 acres and Vargus Plateau Regional Park has approximately

21 1200 acres.) In other words, the park is subject to vigorous CEQA review, but Mr. George's

22 own "park" is not.

23 THE CODE AND PERMIT ENFORCEMENT ACTION INTO THE GEORGE RANCH

24 PROJECT AND DETERMINATION OF THE APPLICATION OF CEQA

25 59. The County first issued permit number BLD2014-02739 for the foundation of the

26 12,000 square foot "barn" on or about February 6, 2015, and BLD2014-01654 for the

27 construction of the same on or about November 5, 2015. The County issued permit number
28 BLD2014-02024 on or about August 29, 2014 for retaining walls.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 16

1 60. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege, based on a journalistic

2 investigation arising out of the 2014-2015 Report of the Alameda County Grand Jury, that the

3 permits for the "mini palace of Versailles" were fast-tracked in a highly irregular manner. Prior

4 to their issuance, a qualified professional on the staff of the County Planning Department wrote

5 the following assessment of the George Ranch Project in an email communication dated July 14,

6 2014: "Please do not issue any permits at this time. It's part of a much larger project that does

7 require CEQA and rezoning." Regardless, Respondents authorized the construction of the "mini

8 palace of Versailles," which is not intended for an agricultural purpose, to bypass building

9 review and failed to undertake the CEQA review that is required by law.

10 61. Albert Lopez, Planning Department Director for the County, states in a July 11,

11 2017 internal email, "it came in as a "barn" structure that looked more like a mini palace of

12 Versailles. It was clearly being planned to be something else than a barn, So we sent a letter

13 saying if the use changes to something that is not ag related we would send code enforcement. It

14 was the best we could do at the time since the "barn" was legal land use-wise. The structure

15 itself was permitted by BID [Building Inspection Dept] and we signed off on it. We went back

16 and forth on the CEQA process and ultimately determined that since it was being built to replace

17 an existing barn over disturbed area, we exempted it from CEQA."

18 62. The County did in fact engage in a code enforcement action based on "use

19 changes to something not ag related" with respect to the "mini Versailles," which, as of
20 November 14, 2017, was ongoing.

21 63. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon alleges that the County did not

22 issue a Notice of Exemption or other public notice regarding its finding as stated in the

23 November 14, 2017 that the "mini-Versailles" was exempt from CEQA.

24 64. On or about November 8, 2017, the County issued permit BLD2017-03666 to

25 complete the construction of the 12,000 square foot barn, even though it admitted the "barn" was

26 no barn, but a "mini palace of Versailles" only four months earlier. On or about November 21,

27 2017, the County issued permit BLD2017-02969 for new construction of a large courtyard with

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 17

1 waterfall, deck, retaining walls, storage area, gas fire place, and stairs. None of these

2 authorizations for work and/or construction underwent CEQA review.

3 65. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege Mr. and Mrs. George did

4 not seek or obtain permits at the time of the construction and creation of the lake, the dam, the

5 beach, the parking lot, the brewery, the greenhouse, the gazebo or the 5,000 square foot "barn".

6 None of these projects underwent a CEQA review.

7 66. Since 2016, Petitioners have complained to the County regarding the George

8 Ranch Project and portions thereof, the use of George Ranch being something other than

9 agricultural, and their potential and actual significant negative effects on the environment,

10 including traffic and public safety, and habitat and waterway destruction. Petitioners have

11 demanded CEQA compliance, but to date, Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege

12 that the County has not engaged in CEQA compliance with respect to the George Ranch Project.

13 67. In light of the numerous complaints Petitioners have made regarding the George

14 Ranch Project and its use for purposes other than agricultural, the County engaged in a code and

15 permit enforcement action of the George Ranch Project and portions thereof, including "the

16 ongoing construction of the barn facility as well as discuss [sic] the overall use of the property

17 and any other permits that may need to have been secured by the property owner", according

18 to a November 14, 2017 email to Lawrence Edelson, a member of the Petitioner Mission Peak

19 Conservancy, Shawn Wilson and Chris Bazar, Director of the Community Development

20 Association.

21 68. Mr. Lopez stated in this email that "based on the complaints that we have

22 received, other structures on the property are being looked at as well, and the property owner
23 has met several times with the building department to discuss what he needs to do to bring

24 some of those structures into compliance. This is an ongoing code enforcement case and

25 naturally we are working towards resolution and getting all the buildings on the parcel
26 permitted and up to county code."

27 69. Thus, the 12,000 square foot "barn" had received its initial construction permit in
28 2015 and again on November 8, 2017. But, as of November 14, 2017, only six days later, the

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 18

1 County advises Petitioners that it is involved in a code and permit enforcement action regarding

2 the structure it had already permitted, and those unpermitted structures as well, and to determine

3 whether CEQA review is required of the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof.

4 70. Mr. Lopez stated that "no discretionary permits have been required so far based

5 on the proposed use, and if through the code enforcement process this remains true, then the

6 CEQA process will not be necessary. We have forwarded the concerns related to biological

7 habitat to the appropriate State officials, and are awaiting their response."

8 71. Again, even though the County allegedly determined CEQA was not applicable to
the 12,000 square foot "mini Versailles" as an existing structure exemption, the County, not later

10 than November 14, 2017, began anew the process to determine whether CEQA applies to said

11 structure as well as the other structures and changes.

12 72. According to this November 14, 2017 email, the County was holding off on any

13 final decisions regarding the applicability of CEQA review of the George Ranch Project and

14 portions thereof, including the "mini-Versailles," pending the results of the code enforcement

15 and permit action and responses from the appropriate State officials. That was approximately six

16 months ago, and Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that any findings made

17 by the County regarding the applicability of CEQA review to the George Ranch Project through

18 its code and permit enforcement action against the same have been made within the past 180

19 days.

20 73. At no time has the County issued a Notice of Exemption or any public notice

21 regarding any findings it has made regarding CEQA review of the George Ranch Project or any

22 portions thereof as a result of their investigation into the same that began no later than Novemberl

23 14, 2017. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege the County has determined not

24 to require or conduct a CEQA review of the George Ranch project and any portions thereof,

25 including but not limited to:

26 a. The ongoing construction of a 12,000 square foot "barn";

27 b. The creation of a six million gallon lake and dam to stop flow of the

C. The creation of a white sand beach alongside the lake;
2 d. The construction of a 5,000 square foot "barn";

3 e. The construction of a 2,000 square foot greenhouse;
4 f. The construction of a large gazebo;
5 g. The construction of a mobile/manufactured home;
6 h. The excavation and grading of pastureland for parking for up to 100 cars;
7 i. The installation of a brewery and/or a workshop and storage facility for
8 antique steam-powered agricultural equipment inside the 5,000 square foot
9 barn; and

10 j. The construction of a plaza courtyard containing a water fall, fireplace,
11 and retaining walls.
12 k. The installation of a 500 feet gas line.
13 Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the County has determined
14 that the George Ranch Project, and/or portions of the same as listed above, are exempt from
15 CEQA review, or do not qualify as a project under CEQA, within the past 180 days.
16 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

17 Failure to Direct CEQA Review of the George Ranch Project
18 The George Ranch Project is a "Project" and No Exemptions Apply
19 74. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in
20 paragraphs 1 through 73 as though fully stated herein.
21 75. Respondents are subject to the requirements of CEQA when evaluating a project
22 that may have a significant effect on the environment. The George Ranch Project is a "project,"
23 and/or the portions thereof a part of a "project," as that term is defined by CEQA, and has caused
24 and may cause direct physical changes in the environment, and carries the risk of reasonably
25 foreseeable indirect physical changes in the environment. The George Ranch Project and/or any
26 portions thereof involves or is legally required to involve the County's issuance of permits, the
27 enforcement of permits, and the enforcement of code violations.
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 20

1 76. Unless an exemption applies, or the activity does not meet the definition of a
2 project, CEQA requires governmental authorities, such as Respondents, to fully evaluate
3 potential environmental effects of projects like the George Ranch Project, and to seek feasible

4 means to reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that otherwise could result from
5 their actions. CEQA limits the County from approving projects with significant adverse impacts

6 when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen such impacts.
77. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege the County violated
8 CEQA because it failed to require and direct CEQA review and reporting for the George Ranch
Project and/or portions thereof, based on certain exemptions, and/or under the false premise and
10 unsupported assertion that the George Ranch Project does not meet the definition of a "project"
11 under CEQA.

12 78. Categorical exemptions to CEQA review, however, do not apply to the George
13 Ranch Project and/or any portion thereof, as fully described in this Petition, and the George
14 Ranch Project and/or portions thereof, meet the definition of a "project".
15 79. CEQA requires Respondents to evaluate the environmental impacts of the George
16 Ranch Project of "the whole of an action". (California Code of Regulations § 15378(A).)
17 Respondents must analyze the environmental impacts of all reasonably foreseeable portions of
18 the George Ranch Project and cannot separate this larger project into smaller ones such that each
19 individually has a lesser environmental impact than the whole together, thus ignoring the impact
20 of the George Ranch Project as a whole. (Laurel Heights Improvement Association v. Regents
21 of the University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 396.)
22 80. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that Respondents, in
23 making their findings that CEQA review does not apply to the George Ranch Project and/or
24 portions thereof, violated CEQA and have impermissibly and separately analyzed the 12,000
25 square foot "ag barn," the courtyard, the lake, the dam, the beach, the parking lot(s), the 5,000
26 square foot barn, and the gazebo that make up the George Ranch Project, as separate individual
27 projects.

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 21

81. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that Respondents have
2 violated CEQA and determined that exemptions apply individually to each portion of the entire
3 George Ranch Project, versus determining whether CEQA applies to the George Ranch Project
4 a as a whole, and/or determined that each individual portion of the George Ranch Project are not a
5 "project" subject to CEQA review, as opposed to the George Ranch Project as a whole.
6 82. Had the County analyzed whether CEQA applies to the whole of the George
*7 Ranch Project as an official with Planning Dept proposed in July 2014, substantial evidence
8 would have led to the undeniable conclusion that replacing an old barn with a "mini Palace of
9 Versailles" complete with a courtyard plaza, expanding a cattle stockpond into a lake with an a
10 artificial white-sand beach on the north side, damming the watercourse (stream) to create the
11 lake, grading the former rolling pastureland into parking lot(s) with space for 100 cars, and
12 erecting a barn with a brewery or workshop and storage shed for antique, steam-powered farm
13 equipment, would create and has created significant and multiple environmental impacts more
14 than sufficient to meet the definition of a project to trigger CEQA review and a report on the
15 same.

16 83. Furthermore, there are exceptions to the categorical exemptions under CEQA.
17 California Code of Regulations § 15300.2(b) and (c), state:
18 (b) Cumulative Impact. All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the
19 cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is
20 significant.

21 (c) Significant Effect. A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where
22 there is a reasonable possibility that the activity a will have a significant effect on the
23 environment due to unusual circumstances. (California Code of Regulations §
24 15300.2(b) and (c), emphasis added.)

25 84. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that if any exemptions do
26 apply to the George Ranch Project, which Petitioners deny, these exceptions to the exemptions
27 preclude the County from relying on the exemptions to foreclose CEQA review and reporting.
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 22

85. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the George Ranch
2 Project and/or portions of the same, both permitted and non-permitted work, are the subject of
the County's ongoing code and permit enforcement action (as of November 14, 2017), and the
9 County's determination as to whether CEQA applies.
5 86. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the County violated
6 CEQA and made unlawful findings that the George Ranch Project and/or any portions thereof
7 are not subject to CEQA compliance because of certain exemptions, or because it does not meet
8 the definition of a "project" under CEQA, as a part of its code and permit enforcement action at
9 the George Ranch Project.

10 87. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that no exemptions under
11 CEQA apply to the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof, and challenge Respondents'
12 findings to the contrary as unlawful.

13 88. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the George Ranch
14 Project and all portions thereof, is a "project" under CEQA, and challenge Respondents' findings
15 to the contrary as unlawful.

16 89. Petitioners seek a writ of mandate revoking, rescinding, or voiding any and all
17 decisions, determinations and/or findings of the County that the George Ranch Project, and any
18 portions thereof, are exempt from CEQA compliance.
19 90. Petitioners seek a writ of mandate revoking, rescinding, or voiding any and all
20 decisions, determinations and/or findings of the County that the George Ranch Project, and any
21 portions thereof, do not meet the definition of a "project" under CEQA.
22 91. Petitioners seek a writ of mandate revoking, rescinding, or voiding any and all
23 authorizations for construction of the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof issued by the
24 County in reliance on the County's unlawful findings that CEQA compliance is not required.
25 92. Petitioners are entitled to recover attorneys' fees as provided in Code of Civil
26 Procedure section 1021.5 if they prevail in this action and the Court finds a significant benefit
27 has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons, and that the necessity and
28 burden of private enforcement is such as to make an award of fees appropriate.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 23

1 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

2 Failure to Conduct CEQA Review of the George Ranch Project

3 93. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in
4 paragraphs 1 through 92 as though fully stated herein.

5 94. Respondents are subject to the requirements of CEQA when evaluating a project
6 that may have a significant effect on the environment. The George Ranch Project is a "'project,'
7 and/or the portions thereof a part of a "project," as that term is defined by CEQA, and has causedl
8 and may cause direct physical changes in the environment, and carries the risk of reasonably
9 foresecable indirect physical changes in the environment. The George Ranch Project and/or any
10 portions thereof involves the County's issuance of permits, the enforcement of permits, and the
11 enforcement of code violations.

12 95. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that as a result of
13 Respondents' unlawful findings that the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof are
14 exempt from CEQA and/or are not a "project" under CEQA, Respondents further violated
15 CEQA by failing to conduct and/or prepare an Initial Study and a report on the same.

16 96. Petitioners seek a writ of mandate directing Respondents to comply with CEQA
17 with respect to the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof, and ordering Respondents to
18 prepare and complete an Initial Study under CEQA.

19 97. Petitioners are entitled to recover attorneys' fees as provided in Code of Civil

20 Procedure section 1021.5 if it prevails in this action and the Court finds a significant benefit has
21 been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons, and that the necessity and
22 burden of private enforcement is such as to make an award of fees appropriate.
23 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
24 Declaratory Relief

25 98. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in
26 paragraphs 1 through 97 as though fully stated herein.

27

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 24

1 99. A dispute and an actual controversy exists between Petitioners and Respondents
2 concerning their rights and duties in that Petitioners contend, and Respondents deny, the
3 following:

4 a. That the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof is "project" under
5 CEQA;

6 b. That no exemptions apply to permit the County to forgo CEQA review of the
7 George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof, including but not limited to, conducting an Initial
8 Study and preparing a report of the same;

9 C. That CEQA review of the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof,
10 including but not limited to, conducting an Initial Study and preparing a report of the same is
11 required;

12 d. That Petitioners fundamental rights have been violated.
13 100. Petitioners desire a judicial determination of the respective rights and duties of
14 Petitioners and Respondents with respect to CEQA applicability to the George Ranch Project
15 and/or portions thereof

16 101. Such declarations are necessary and appropriate at this time in order that
17 Petitioners and Respondents may ascertain Respondents obligations under CEQA with respect to
18 the George Ranch Project and Petitioners rights.

19 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

20 Injunctive Relief

21 102. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in
22 paragraphs 1 through 101 as though fully stated herein.

23 103. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege Respondents have
24 unlawfully issued authorizations for construction of the George Ranch Project and/or portions
25 thereof in violation of CEQA, and have determined, despite an ongoing investigation into both
26 the permitted and unpermitted work on the George Ranch Project, that CEQA does not apply.
27 Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege the County unlawfully determined the
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 25

1 George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof are exempt from CEQA or do not qualify as a

2 "project".
104. Construction of the mini Versailles continues unabated, as does the plaza.

4 Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege the brewing activities continue, and large
events continue to be held on a regular basis, using Morrison Canyon Road as access.

105. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege large events, such as
weddings, are set to be held at George Ranch this summer.

8 106. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege the damage done to the

9 environment already and in the future as a result of the George Ranch Project and/or portions

10 thereof and the illegal uses of the same, will continue unmitigated unless the County and Real

11 Parties in Interest are ordered to halt construction pending a judgment by this Court that CEQA

12 review and reporting is required, to suspend the issuance of any permits for the George Ranch

13 Project and any portion thereof pending a judgment by this Court that CEQA review and

14 reporting is required, and to restrict event use of George Ranch.

15 107. Petitioners demanded and requested that Respondents and Real Parties in Interest

16 refrain from the conduct alleged herein and sought CEQA compliance, but Respondents failed

17 and refused the requests and, unless restrained by an order of this court, will continue

18 construction of the George Ranch Project, and continue to authorize construction and

19 impermissible uses of George Ranch.

20 108. By reason of the wrongful and unlawful acts, Petitioners have and will sustain

21 great and irreparable injury as described herein with respect to habitat and waterway alteration

22 and/or destruction and increased traffic and the safety issues presented due to the condition of

23 Morrison Canyon Road. It will be impossible for Petitioners to obtain adequate relief by way of

24 money damages, and therefore, is without an adequate remedy at law.

25 109. Petitioners seek temporary stay order, temporary restraining order, and

26 preliminary and permanent injunctions restraining Real Parties in Interest and Respondents, their

27 agents, employees, officers, and representatives from undertaking any construction, grading,

28 excavation, order or delivery of construction materials, installation or development, issuing any

1 construction or development approvals or permits, making any contracts, allowing or sponsoring

2 any large gatherings or assemblies whether for public use or private enjoyment in the
"agricultural barn" or on other portions of the George Ranch Project, or taking any other action

4 to implement in any way the George Ranch Project and any portion thereof pending judgment of

5 this Court and/or compliance with CEQA.
WHEREFORE, Petitioners request judgment against Respondents as follows:
7 1. For a writ of mandate directing Respondents to set aside the claimed exemption(s)l
8 from CEQA and/or that the George Ranch Project and/or portions thereof are not a "project"
9 subject to CEQA;

10 2. For a writ of mandate directing Respondents to comply with CEQA with respect
11 to the George Ranch Project and ordering Respondents to prepare and complete an Initial Study
12 under CEQA and applicable reporting;

13 3. A judgment declaring that a fundamental vested right of the Petitioners is

14 adversely affected.

15 4. For a temporary stay order, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and
16 permanent injunctions restraining Real Parties in Interest and Respondents, their agents,

19 or development approvals or permits, making any contracts, allowing or sponsoring any large
20 gatherings or assemblies whether for public use or private enjoyment in the "agricultural barn" or
21 on other portions of the George Ranch Project, or taking any other action to implement in any
22 way the George Ranch Project and any portion thereof pending judgment by this Court and/or

Re: Notice of Commencement of CEQA Action and filing of Petition - George Ranch, 3505 Morrison Canyon Road, 3163 Morrison Canyon Road, Fremont, California
To Alameda County Board of Supervisors:
Please take notice that on May 18, 2018, Petitioners Kelly Abreau and the Mission Peak Conservancy will file a Petition for a Writ of Mandate in Alameda County Superior Court challenging actions of the County of Alameda, by and through its Community Development Agency, Building Inspection Department, Planning Department, Public Works Agency, and Board of Supervisors ("the County") with respect to the structures and alterations of land and water on properties commonly known as 3505 Morrison Canyon Road, and 3163 Morrison Canyon Road, located in an unincorporated portion of Alameda County near Fremont, California, known as the George Ranch Project.
Petitioners specifically challenge the County's decision(s) not to conduct a review and prepare a report complying with the provisions set forth under the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000, et seq. ("CEQA") with respect to the George Ranch Project and/or any portions thereof, both permitted and non-permitted, including, but not limited to, those that are or were the subject(s) of a code and permit enforcement action in which the County made the determination(s) that CEQA does not apply, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.

Petitioners also challenge the County's issuance of Building Permit Number BLD2017- 02969 on November 21, 2017, Building Permit Number BLD2018-01508, issued on May 8, 2018, and all other permits the County issued for the George Ranch Project, without complying with CEQA provisions.
