Churchwell White 4P (CW070237.6) 3855 East Farmington Road in Stockton, CA
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief

F (the "Site Approval"), and Respondent's denial of Petitioner's appeals for that Site Approval. In

2 support, Petitioner alleges as follows:

3 INTRODUCTION

4 1. On March 8, 2018, the San Joaquin County Community Development Department

5 approved the Site Approval Application No. PA-1700052, subject to certain conditions of

6 approval. The Site Approval approved the development of a 9,450 square foot warehouse and

7 manufacturing building at 3855 East Farmington Road in Stockton, CA (the "Project").

8 2. The Project is located on a triangle-shaped property. Directly west and adjacent to

9 the Project is an existing senior mobile home park. Directly north of both the Project and senior
10 mobile home park are elevated railroad tracks.

11 3. The plans for the Project also include the construction of a six to seven-foot-tall
12 perimeter wall on the northeastern property line, adjacent to the railroad tracks, and on the
13 western property line, adjacent to the senior mobile home park.

14 4. When it rains, a significant amount of runoff from the railroad tracks is directed
15 onto the Project site and senior mobile home park. The Project's planned exterior walls will
16 redirect a significant amount of the Property's runoff flow towards the senior mobile home park.

17 This excess water from the railroad tracks and Project property will cause flooding and damage
18 individual property at the senior mobile home park.

19 5. Without appropriate mitigation measures and sufficient drainage improvements,

20 the Project will be injurious to the adjacent properties and is not compatible with adjoining land

21 uses. Respondent's approval of the Site Approval without the appropriate mitigation measures is

22 an abuse of discretion.

23 PARTIES

24 6. Petitioner is a California limited liability company and is and was at all times
25 mentioned herein registered in the State of California with its principal place of business in

26 Stockton, CA. Petitioner owns property directly adjacent to the Project site. Petitioner's property

27 will be directly and adversely affected by Respondent's approval of Site Approval Application

28 No. PA-1700052.

{CW070237.6} 2

Churchwell White u Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief

1 7. Respondent County of San Joaquin is a political subdivision of the State of

2 California which exercises local land use authority. Respondent County of San Joaquin had the

3 principal responsibility of approving site approvals within its jurisdiction to the extent they are

4 consistent with applicable land use laws and the San Joaquin County Code.

5 8. Real Party in Interest NJ McFadden Development LLC is a business entity, form

6 unknown, which Petitioner is informed and believes is, and was at all times relevant to this action,

7 doing business in San Joaquin County, California.

8 9. Real Party in Interest Siegfried Engineering, Inc. is a California corporation with

9 its principal place of business in San Joaquin County. Siegfried Engineering, Inc. submitted Site

10 Approval Application No. PA-1700052 to Respondent County of San Joaquin Community

11 Development Department on behalf of NJ McFadden Development LLC.

12 10. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and identities of DOES 1 through 20 and

13 21 through 40, inclusive, and sue such unnamed Respondents and Real Parties in Interest

14 respectively, by their fictitious names. Petitioners are informed and believe, and based thereon

15 allege, that fictitiously named Respondents and Real Parties in Interest also are responsible for all

16 acts or omissions described herein. When the true identifies and capacities of Respondents and

17 Real Parties in Interest have been determined, Petitioners will, with leave of the Court if

18 necessary, amend this Petition to include such identities and capacities.

19 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

20 11. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to

21 Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5. This Court has the authority to issue a writ of mandate

22 directing Respondent to vacate and set aside its approval of Site Approval PA-1700052 and its

23 denial of Petitioner's appeal on the same matter pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section

24 1094.5.

25 12. The Court is authorized to grant declaratory relief pursuant to Code of Civil

26 Procedure Section 1060.

13. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 393

2 and 394(a), because Petitioner and Respondent have their principle places of business or are
located in San Joaquin County.

14. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this action and
has exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

15. a Petitioner has a clear, present, and beneficial right to have Respondent not abuse

7 its discretion in enforcing its land use authority.

16. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the course of ordinary

9 law, unless this Court grants the requested relief to require Respondent to set aside its decision to

10 approve the Site Approval and its decision to deny Petitioner's appeals of the Site Approval. In

11 the absence of such remedies, Respondent's decision will remain in place and the effects of the

12 Site Approval will continue to adversely affect Petitioner.

13 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

14 17. Prior to March 8, 2018, NJ McFadden Development LLC c/o Siegfried

15 Engineering, Inc. submitted Site Approval Application No. PA-1700052 to the San Joaquin

16 County Community Development Department.

17 18. On or about March 8, 2018, Respondent, by and through its Community
18 Development Department, approved Site Approval Application No. PA-1700052, for the

19 development of a 9,450 square foot warehouse and manufacturing building, with an attached

20 1,800 square foot canopy, and a detached 540 square foot canopy for a private fueling station, at

21 3855 East Farmington Road in Stockton, CA. The warehouse building will be used for the

22 purpose of storing manufacturing equipment, vehicles, raw materials, and manufactured product.

23 Stored materials will include steel, wood, and masonry or concrete products.
24 19. As part of the Site Approval, Respondent included various conditions of approval.
25 In particular, the conditions of approval required the construction of a six to seven-foot tall
26 masonry wall along the western properly line to screen the Project's activities from being visible

27 to neighboring properties. The Project also proposes to build a wall a along the northeastern
28 property line, adjacent to the railroad tracks.

{CW070237.6} 4

Churchwell White P Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief

1 20. On or about March 18, 2018, Petitioner filed a timely appeal to the Planning

2 Commission to challenge the Community Development Department's approval of the Site

3 Approval.

4 21. In its appeal, Petitioner stated that the approval failed to make the necessary

5 findings as required by the San Joaquin County Code ("SJCC"). Specifically, SJCC section 9-

6 816.6 requires Respondent to make certain findings prior to approving a site approval application.

7 Petitioner's appeal stated that approval of the Site Approval application violated SJCC sections 9-

8 818.6, subdivisions (b), (d), and (e), because the Project lacks the necessary drainage

9 improvements to ensure that it will not be injurious to the property or improvements of adjacent

10 property and will be compatible with the adjoining senior mobile home park.

11 22. On or about May 3, 2018, the Planning Commission held a public hearing during a

12 its regularly scheduled meeting to consider the appeal. At the meeting, one individual spoke in

13 favor of the Project and two individuals spoke against the Project. After considering the oral and

14 written testimony, the Planning Commission voted 4-0 to deny the appeal and approve the Site

15 Approval.

16 23. On or about May 14, 2018, Petitioner filed a timely appeal to the Board of

17 Supervisors of the Planning Commission's denial of its appeal and subsequent approval of the

18 Site Approval.

19 24. In its appeal, Petitioner stated that the Project lacks adequate drainage, would be
20 injurious to adjacent properties, and is not compatible with adjoining land uses pursuant to SJCC

21 section 9-818.6, subdivisions (b), (d), and (e). The appeal stressed that the Project was responsible

22 for mitigating storm water runoff both that originated onsite and tributary to the Project site.

23 Further, the appeal stated that there is no legal right for a landowner to artificially redirect flows
24 onto an adjacent property, especially if those flows are redirected by erecting a wall. Thus, the

25 Project is responsible for providing adequate drainage of all runoff that exits the Project site. The

26 appeal requested that Respondent include additional conditions of approval to ensure that the

27 Project mitigate against all storm water runoff that leaves the Project site, not only runoff that

28 originates onsite.

(CW070237.6) 5
Churchwell White uP Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief

1 25. On or about August 21, 2018, the Board of Supervisors held a public hearing
2 during its regularly scheduled meeting to consider the appeal. At the meeting, one individual

3 spoke in favor of the Project and two individuals spoke against the Project. After considering the

4 oral and written testimony, the Board of Supervisors voted 5-0 to deny the appeal and approve the

5 Site Approval.

6 26. Petitioner brings this Petition pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure

7 section 1094.5, seeking an order from this Court to compel Respondent to rescind its denial of

8 Petitioner's appeals and its approval of the Site Approval. The evidence presented during the

9 May 3, 2018, and August 21, 2018, public hearings do not support Respondent's decision to deny

10 the appeals and approve the Site Approval.

11 27. Decisions of the Board of Supervisors on an appeal from the Planning

12 Commission are final and effective immediately. (SJCC, § 9-220.11, subd. (f).) Following the

13 denial of Petitioner's appeal by the Board of Supervisors, Petitioner has exhausted all

14 administrative remedies available to it.

15 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

16 Writ of Mandate Against Respondents (Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5)
17 28. Petitioner realleges and incorporates here by this reference the allegations of

18 paragraphs 1 through 27, as through set forth in full.

19 29. SJCC section 9-818.6 requires Respondent to make five specific findings prior the

20 approval of a site approval.

21 30. First, Respondent must find "Consistency," that the proposed use is consistent

22 with the goals, policies, standards, and maps of the General Plan, any applicable Master Plan,

23 Specific Plan, and Special Purpose Plan, and any other applicable plan adopted by the County.

24 (SJCC, § 9-818.6, subd. (a).)

25 31. Second, Respondent must find "Improvements," that adequate utilities, roadway
26 improvements, sanitation, water supply, drainage, and other necessary facilities have been
27 provided, and the proposed improvements are properly related to existing and proposed roadways.

28 (SJCC, § 9-818.6, subd. (b).)

{CW070237.6) 6

Churchwell White uP Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief

32. Third, Respondent must find "Site Suitability," that the site is physically suitable

2 for the type of development and for the intensity of development. (SJCC, § 9-818.6, subd. (c).)

3 33. Fourth, Respondent must find "Issuance Not Detrimental," that issuance of the

4 permit will not be significantly detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare, or be injurious

5 to the property or improvements of adjacent properties. (SJCC, § 9-818.6, subd. (d).)

6 34. Fifth, Respondent must find "Compatibility," that the use is compatible with

7 adjoining land uses. (SJCC, § 9-818.6, subd. (e).)

8 35. The masonry wall along the northeastern and western portions of the Project site

9 will redirect storm water runoff which originates from the Project site and enters onto the Project

10 site from the northern rail road tracks. This storm water runoff will be redirected onto the

11 neighboring senior mobile home park to the west. This redirected runoff will cause flooding and

12 property damage at the senior mobile home park.

13 36. Respondent did not require sufficient conditions of approval and mitigation

14 measures to mitigate for the drainage issues which will cause flooding and property damage at the

15 senior mobile home park.

16 37. Due to the drainage and flooding issues, the Project lacks adequate drainage

17 improvements, would be injurious to adjacent properties, and is not compatible with adjoining

18 land uses in violation of SJCC section 9-818.6, subdivisions (b), (d), and (e).

19 38. By approving the Site Approval without appropriate conditions of approval to

20 mitigate the drainage issues, Respondent has acted without substantial evidence to support its

21 required findings in violation of the law.

22 39. Respondent abused its discretion in approving the Site Approval and denying

23 Petitioner's appeals.

24 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

25 Declaratory Relief
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1060)
26 40. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by this reference all of the allegations

27 in paragraphs 1 through 39, as through set forth in full.

28 ///

{CW070237.6}
Churchwell White uo Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief

41. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between Petitioner and

2 Respondent concerning Respondent's approval of the Site Approval and denials of Petitioner's

3 appeals, in that Petitioner, on the one hand, contends that Respondent abused its discretion in

4 approving the Site Approval which violates SJCC section 9-818.6, subdivisions (b), (d), and (e)

5 by not requiring sufficient conditions of approval and mitigation measures to prevent injury to

6 adjacent properties, and in denying Petitioner's appeal on the issue, and Respondent, on the other

7 hand, either has contended or will contend otherwise.

8 42. A judicial declaration and determination is necessary at this time under these

9 circumstances in order to determine the rights and obligations of the parties with regard to

10 Respondent's approval of the Site Approval and denial of Respondent's appeals.

11 43. Petitioner desires a judicial determination and declaration that Respondent's

12 approval of the Site Approval and denial of Respondent's appeals was improper pursuant to SJCC

13 section 9-818.6, subdivisions (b), (d), and (e) and Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5.

14 PRAYER

15 WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully prays for judgment against Respondents as

16 follows:

17 1. That this Court issue a peremptory writ of mandate, commanding Respondents to:

18 a. Vacate and set aside, in its entirety, Respondent's August 21, 2018

19 approval of Site Approval Application No. PA-1700052; and

20 b. Vacate and set aside, in its entirety, Respondent's August 21, 2018 denial

21 of Petitioner's appeal of the approval of Site Approval Application No.

22 PA-1700052.

23 2. For a declaration that Respondent's approval of the Site Approval and denial of

24 Respondent's appeals was improper pursuant to SJCC section 9-818.6, subdivisions (b), (d), and

25 (e) and Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5.

26 3. For reasonable attorney's fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section

27 1021.5.

28 4. For Petitioner's costs and expenses in this action.

(CW070237.6} 8
