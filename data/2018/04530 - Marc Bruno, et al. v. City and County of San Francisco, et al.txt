PETITIONERS' NOTICE OF INTENT TO PREPARE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD

1 Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6(b)(2), Petitioner-Plaintiffs hereby
2 notify all parties that they elect to prepare the administrative record relating to the above-
3 captioned action relating to Respondent Board of Supervisors of the City and County of San
4 Francisco's ("Board") approval of the CEQA Categorical Exemption Determination proposed by
5 the San Francisco Planning Department for 20 Nobles Alley (Block Lot 0104/025) and issuance
6 of such categorical exemption for the Project, illegally exempting the Project from review under
7 the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Pub. Res. Code ("PRC") § 21000, et seq.
8

9 In so doing, the Board voted to uphold the September 13, 2017 Notice of Decision by the
10 San Francisco Board of Appeals approving Appeal No. 17-088, upon which the above referenced
11 CEQA Categorical Exemption is reliant, illegally ignoring an on-going investigation by the San
12 Francisco Ethics Commission of multiple Conflict of Interest Complaints against Mr. Richard
13 Swig, a Member of the Board of Appeals, and Mr. Patrick Buscovich, a Member of the Board of
14 Examiners, whose joint participation in the Appeals proceeding was prejudicial and illegal.
15

16 In so doing, the Board also illegally overturned its own legislative mandate, issued after
17 due deliberations in 2010, to prohibit all new garages in the "Telegraph Hill North Beach Special
18 Use District" on right of ways under 41 feet in width. This legislative mandate is expressed in
19 Planning Code Section 249.49.

20

21 Respondents, Real Parties in Interest and Defendants are directed not to prepare the
22 administrative record for this action and not to expend any resources to prepare said
23 administrative record.

1. Petitioner Plaintiff Marc Bruno, an individual residing in San
Francisco, and Save North Beach, a non-profit association, hereby petition
this Court under California Code of Civil Procedure ("CCP") Section
1094.5 for issuance of a Writ of Administrative Mandamus to Respondent
City and County of an Francisco ("City" or "CCSF"), Respondent Board of
Supervisors for the City and County of San Francisco ("Board"), et al..
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS; WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE
MANDATE UNDER THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT (CEQA)

-2-

2. Petitioners intend to show that Respondent - Defendants' reports, plans,
investigations and statements to the Board of Supervisors and to the Board of
Appeals conclusively prove that approval of the CEQA Categorical Exemption
Determination proposed by the San Francisco Planning Department for 20
Nobles Alley (Block Lot 0104/025) and issuance of such categorical exemption
illegally exempts the Project from review under the California Environmental
Quality Act ("CEQA"), Pub. Res. Code ("PRC") § 21000, et seq.

3. Petitioner Plaintiffs alloge that the most rudimentary public disclosure
requirements under CEQA and under the City Sunshine Ordinance will be
violated should the Categorical Exemption at-issue here not be set aside.
Petitioners ask the Court to take judicial notice of the current Sunshine Ordinance
Task Force Complaint-- filed in this matter against Respondent Planning
Department and Respondent Board of Appeals-- based on the failure of these
departments and agencies to adequately inform the public of the permit
applications and construction plans at issue in this matter, as required by law.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS; WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE
MANDATE UNDER THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT (CEQA)

-3-

4. Petitioner Plaintiffs further allege that the City's Ethics Code and the Political
Reform Act of 1974 (a.k.a. the California Governmental Conduct Code) shall be

violated should the Board of Supervisors' decision to uphold the Categorical

Exemption not be overturned by this court. By voting to not continue its
deliberations at a later a date, the Board of Supervisors also unreasonably ignored
on-going investigation by the San Francisco Ethics Commission of multiple

Conflict of Interest Complaints against Mr. Richard Swig, a Member of the

Board of Appeals, and Mr. Patrick Buscovich, a Member of the Board of
Examiners, whose joint participation in the Appeals proceeding on this matter

contradicts and undermines the aforementioned Ethics Code and Political Reform

Act.

5. Petitioners further intend to show that the City of San Francisco Planning Code
Section 249.49, the express public policy of which is the prohibition of additional
garages in the Telegraph Hill North Beach Special Use District shall be made
ineffective and the very public for which it was written shall be irreparably
harmed should the Board of Supervisors Motion be left to stand.

PARTIES

6. Petitioner Marc Bruno, an individual citizen residing in San Francisco, has

lived at his current address in North Beach since April, 1986. He is a community
organizer who regularly works with the homeless and poor.

7. Petitioner Save North Beach is a non-profit association for which corporate
501(c)(4) status is pending. Members of the organization live in, work in, own

property in and/or own a business a or business-es in the Telegraph Hill North

Beach Special Usc District and San Francisco Supervisorial District 3. The
organization is dedicated to preserving the cultural wealth and environmental
integrity of the neighborhood by serving the poorest of the poor and by serving
those who face eviction from their apartments and homes. The organization also
serves as a policy forum in favor of environmental justice.

8. The CCSF, at all times pertinent herein, was and is a municipal corporation

organized and existing under the laws of the State of California and the municipal

charter.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS; WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE
MANDATE UNDER THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT (CEQA)

-5-

9. The Board of Supervisors, at all times pertinent herein, was and is now a
legally constituted body of the CCSF organized under Article 2 of the City
Charter. Pursuant to § 21151(c) of the Public Resources Code, CEQA Guidelines
§§15061(e) and 15704(f), the Board as the duly decision making body and acting
in quasi-judicial capacity, is responsible for hearing and acting on appeals
challenging the issuance of an approved Categorical Exemption.

10. The Board of Appeals for the City and County of San Francisco, was and is
now a legally constituted body of the CCSF duly organized under the City

Charter. The Board of Appeals, formerly, until 1998, the Board of Permit

Appeals, typically considers many building permit matters within the boundaries

of the City and County. Its character and procedural obligations are labeled

quasi-judicial, as described in its own rules and regulations and confirmed by
numerous Opinions of the San Francisco City Attorney.

11. The Planning Department for the City and County of San Francisco, was and
is now a legally constituted body of the CCSF duly organized under the City

Charter.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS; WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE
MANDATE UNDER THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT (CEQA)

-6-

12. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of DOES I through XX,
inclusive, and of the true names and capacities of ROES I through XX, inclusive,
and therefore sues said Respondents by such fictitious names. Petitioner will
amend this Petition to allege their true names and capacities when ascertained.

JURISDICTION
13. This court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to § 1094.5 of the
California Code of Civil Procedure.

14. Venue is proper because the Respondents and the proposed Project Site are
located in the City and County of San Francisco.

STANDING
15. Petitioner Plaintiff Marc Bruno, an individual citizen residing in San
Francisco, is a "person" entitled to file an action under CEQA. "Person" includes
any person, firm, association, organization, partnership, business, trust,
corporation, limited liability company. (CEQA Guidelines 9 15376).

16. Petitioner Save North Beach, non-profit association doing business in North
Beach, is a "person" entitled to file an action under CEQA. "Person" includes any
person, firm, association, organization, partnership, business, trust, corporation,
limited liability company. (CEQA Guidelines § 15376).

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS; WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDATE UNDER THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT (CEQA)

17. There is an accepted public policy in this state, encouraged by elected
officials, administrative agencies and the courts "guaranteeing citizens the
opportunity to ensure that no governmental body impairs or defeats the purpose
of legislation establishing a public right." (Green v. Obledo (1981) 29 Cal.3d
126, 144.)

18. The "basic purposes of CEQA" include the following, according to CEQA
Guidelines §15002:

A. Inform government decision-makers and the public about the potential,
significant environmental effects of proposed activities.
B. Identify the ways environmental damage can be avoided or reduced.
C. Prevent significant, avoidable damage to the environment by requiring
changes in projects through the use of alternatives or mitigation measures when
the governmental agency finds the changes to be feasible.
D. Disclose to the public the reasons why a governmental agency approved a
project in the manner the agency chose if significant environmental effects are
involved.

19. The question in this action is one of public right and sound public policy.

20. Petitioners are an interested self-identified group of citizens and an
individual citizen committed to having public laws including CEQA properly
executed.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS; WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE
MANDATE UNDER THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT (CEQA)

-8-

21. Petitioners are interested as an association of citizens and taxpayers, and as an
individual citizen and taxpayer, in having all public resources including those
designated for this project properly used and not wasted.

22. Petitioners have a genuine and continuing interest in and concern for the
environment, including the effect on the environment of governmental activities
such as those from which Petitioners seek relief in this action.

23. Petitioner Plaintiff Marc Bruno has standing as an individual to bring this
action, because the interests of the Petitioner are adversely affected by the
governmental decisions and actions from which relief is requested.

24. Prosecution of this action as a citizen's suit by Petitioner does not conflict
with other competing legislative or public policies.

25. Petitioners complied with Public Resource Code §§ 21177(a) and (b) by filing
the Objections herein attached. (Exhibit B)

26. Based on the foregoing, Petitioners have standing.

STATEMENT OF FACTS

27. Pursuant to California Public Resources Code § 2166(c) and Title XIV
of the California Code of Regulations, § 15162, Respondents are requested
to produce a supplemental and subsequent Environmental Impact Report.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS; WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE
MANDATE UNDER THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT (CEQA)

-9-

As Respondents are proceeding with the project based on a defective EIR
that has never been fully vetted by the citizens most directly affected by the
impact of the project, Respondents also are requested to produce a
programmatic or "Master" EIR.

28. Respondents have been requested on numerous occasions in person and
by mail since August 9, 2016, to produce documents to satisfy Petitioners'
concerns, but these documents have not been produced.

29. As Respondents insist on moving forward with their project in North
Beach as soon as next week, we also prey for injunctive relief from such
actions, until such time that Respondents produced the requested
documents, the requested original and subsequent building plans and the
original and subsequent Permit Application for the project.

30. Petitioner Plaintiffs face on-going and permanent harm should
Respondents be permitted to move forward with their project in North
Beach. Petitioners do not have plain, speedy and adequate remedy at law
other than to prey for injunctive relief and the other remedied requested
herein.

In addition, the following facts regarding the Respondents' defective CEQA
Categorical Exemption are alleged:

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS; WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE
MANDATE UNDER THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT (CEQA)

- 10 -

31. Mr. Eustache de St. Phalle, an attorney, filed an appeal to the Board of
Appeals on or about June 7, 2017. (Appeal 17-088) On or about this day,
Dudley de St. Phalle, Mr. de St. Phalle's wife, filed a seven-page brief to the

Board asking it to overturn a decision made by the San Francisco Planning
Department that a proposed garage at 20 Nobles Alley, a building owned by
the de St. Phalles, be "disapproved." The de St. Phalle's appeal was
scheduled to be heard July 12, 2017 in San Francisco City Hall, Room 466,
at which time and place Mr. de St. Phalle and his wife, Dudley de St.

Phalle, appeared before the Board.

32. At the meeting of the Board of Appeals on July 12, 2017, the
following parties made presentations: Zoning Administrator Scott
Sanchez, Planning Department; Bernie Curran, Department of Building
Inspection; Dudley de St. Phalle; Patrick Buscovich, (representing
appellants); Mr. Marc Bruno, a resident neighbor (and author of this
complaint) and Mr. Brent McDonald, a resident neighbor and architect.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS; WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDATE UNDER THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT (CEQA)

- 11 -

Mr. Sanchez, Mr. Curran, Mr. Bruno and Mr. McDonald spoke in favor of
the Planning Department's "Notice to Disapprove." Appellant de St. Phalles
and Mr. Buscovich spoke in opposition to the Planning Department

disapproval.

33. de St. Phalle's appeal was discussed and voted on by Mr. Richard Swig
and other members of the Board of Appeals on July 12. The Board voted
unanimously to continue the matter until September 13, 2017, because it
was made known during deliberations that contrary to Board Rules and
Regulations no building plans had been submitted to the Board. (San
Francisco Business and Taxation Code, Article 1 §§ 8, 10 - Method of
Appeal to the Board of Appeals, "Record Forwarded.")

34. At the continuance of September 13, 2017, the following parties
presented before the Board of Appeals: Scott Sanchez, Planning
Department; Joseph Duffy, D.B.I., Eustache and Dudley de St. Phalle,
appellants; Marc Bruno, a resident neighbor; Paul Lau, a resident neighbor;

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS; WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDATE UNDER THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT (CEQA)

• 12 -

Louis Biro, a resident neighbor and Brent McDonald, a resident neighbor
and architect; Albert Yee, former owner of 20 Nobles Alley.

35. The four neighbors and former owner who appeared on September 13
testified in support of the Planning Department's disapproval of the
garage/s. When questioned by the Board about the project, Zoning

Administrator Scott Sanchez re-confirmed the Planning Department's

disapproval:
"When the building with the garage doors was researched, 20 Nobles, there
were no permits in the 1990s to do that. A garage existed-- magically
appearing, it seems-- on a drawing in 1999 for an unrelated project. But
there never was a permit that added one or more garage to the subject
property, and that's where we are today. That we maintain that the garages
are not legally existing. Neither one was ever legally existing on the
property, and under the planning code today they cannot add one at this
point. I think that's all I have to say. "

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS; WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE
MANDATE UNDER THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT (CEQA)

- 13 -

36. In addition to the in-person testimony at the hearing September 13,
2017, the Board received 16 letters of opposition and not one letter in favor
of the project. Other than the permit-holders (the de St. Phalles) nobody

testified in favor of the project. Mr. Patrick Buscovich did not present at the

continuance hearing on September 13, although he was in the room and

consulted with the de St. Phalles.

37. During the deliberations prior to the vote, Board Member Swig took the
lead in announcing that he was in favor of the project and wanted to give

the de St. Phalle's- who had just been told their time was up by the Board

President, Darryl Honda-- more time to address the Board. At Mr. Swig's
urging, the Board allowed the de St. Phalle's to re-address some of the
issues raised at the hearing on September 13th Many of these same issues

were raised and addressed at the hearing on July 12.

38. After additional deliberations led by Mr. Swig, the Board moved to

approve the project, a vote was taken and the final ballot was 4 in favor and

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS; WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE
MANDATE UNDER THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT (CEQA)

- 14 -

one opposed. The sole opposing vote was by Board Member Ann Lazarus.
A copy of the Board's "Notice of Decision" on Appeal 17-088 is attached,

Exhibit 11.

EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES, TIMELINESS

39. Pursuant to Public Resource Code §§ 21177 (a) and (b), Petitioner has
exhausted his administrative remedies. See Exhibits 14 and 15, attached.

40. Furthermore, the failure to disclose significant information, known to the
Respondent Planning Department and Respondent Board of Appeals, withheld
from the public, may only be remedied by now permitting the Petitioner Plaintiffs
to sue on behalf of the public to remedy the harm caused by such non-disclosure,
as noted herein.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

41. Board of Supervisors Motion M15-175, upholding on November 14,
2017 the Categorical Exemption mischaracterizes the proposed permit
application that is cited in the Motion. This application, P.A.
201608094528, specifically states that one garage door shall be removed
and moved to the center of the building at 20 Nobles Alley.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS; WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE
MANDATE UNDER THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT (CEQA)

- 15 -

42. By mischaracterizing the nature of he work proposed for the project, the
Board of Supervisors misunderstood the outright contradiction between the
proposed project and their own legislative mandate prohibiting new garages
in North Beach. This mandate is embodied in Planning Code Section
249.49.

[See Exhibit 15: the above referenced Board of Supervisors' Motion, p. 1;
Exhibits 3, 4, 5, 6: Permit Application 201608094528 as described by the
Planning Department on its own website; Exhibit 1: Planning Code Section
249.49.]

43. By mischaracterizing the nature of the work proposed for the project,
the Board of Supervisors mistakenly and illegally enforces a regulatory
violation by the Board of Appeals, which in its regulations specifically
precludes remanding a project back to the decision making agency. This

regulations states: "The Board of Appeals cannot remand (send back) a
decision to the underlying department for further review or action." [See
Exhibit 8.]

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

44. In upholding the Categorical Exemption, the Board of Supervisors
effectively voted to uphold the September 13, 2017 Notice of Decision by

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS; WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE
MANDATE UNDER THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT (CEQA)

- 16 -

the San Francisco Board of Appeals approving Appeal No. 17-088,
unjustifiably ignoring an on-going investigation by the San Francisco Ethics
Commission of multiple Conflict of Interest Complaints against Mr.
Richard Swig, a Member of the Board of Appeals, and Mr. Patrick
Buscovich, a Member of the Board of Examiners, whose joint participation
in the Appeals procceding was prejudicial and illegal.

45. The CEQA Categorical Exemption is dependent on the project sponsors'
ability to legalize one of the two garages at 20 Nobles Alley, a nexus the
planner for the project expressly confirms in the Categorical Exemption. If
the underlying Board of Appeals' decision to legalize at least one garage is
fatally flawed because of violations of the City Ethics Code and State
Governmental Conduct Code, then, the CEQA Exemption cannot stand. By
Respondents' own admission, Project Sponsors' conformity with the
"Secretary of Interior's standards for Rehabilitation" is dependent upon
Sponsors' ability to legalize at least one garage before the Board of Appeals.
[Exhibit 10: pp 6, 7 and 8.]

THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

46. The effect of a Categorical Exemption at 20 Nobles is to allow an illegal
garage currently located there-- a garage which, being poorly designed, has
never been used-- to be legalized and modified-for-use.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS; WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE
MANDATE UNDER THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT (CEQA)

- 17 -

47. By adding this garage to the four block commercial corridor in the heart of
the North Beach Historic District, the proposed project represents "substantial
change that may effect the environment," a change that requires review under the
California Environmental Quality Act.

48. "Categorical Exemption" means no review whatsoever. We ask instead for, at
the very least, a Mitigated Negative Declaration, the only review that will give
City residents a chance to protect this unique urban oasis, this pedestrian friendly

and graceful alley.

49. The surrounding alleyway and the North Beach Historic District is greatly
damaged by the act of a garage or two being illegally installed at 20 Nobles
Alley. A new baseline cannot be established here because the garages were built
without plans, without permits, without input from the neighborhood and without
approval by any city agency or department. To allow these garage/s to remain
here is a fraud upon the Charter and inconsistent with the express and implied
purpose of CEQA.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS; WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDATE UNDER THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT (CEQA)

- 18 -

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

50. WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for all of the following:
A. A judgment that the building, modification, installation, creation and/or
legalization of a new garage at the site 20 Nobles Alley be subject to CEQA
review. At the very least, a conditional review is required in this matter.
B. A peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents to set aside all
decisions and actions corresponding to the Categorical Exemption;
C. A preliminary injunction prohibiting the real party in interest from executing
those actions, including but not limited to demolition, conversion, remodeling or

other actions that are required for the garage envisioned at 20 Nobles Alley;
D. An administrative stay order, temporary restraining order, and/or preliminary
injunction enjoining the Respondents, and the Real Parties in Interest, and their
agents and employees from any and all physical actions in furtherance of the
project;
E. Costs of this action;
F. Attorneys' Fees;
G. For other such relief as the Court may deem just and proper.

San Francisco Planning Code § 249.49.

TELEGRAPH HILL - NORTH BEACH
RESIDENTIAL SPECIAL USE DISTRICT

a.

Purposes. To regulate off-street parking and the installation of garages in existing residential structures in order to ensure that they do not significantly increase the level of automobile traffic, increase pollution, or impair pedestrian use on narrow public rights-of-way in the District; and to prevent the ability to add parking from providing an incentive to convert existing residential buildings from rental buildings to tenancies-in-common.

b.

Applicability. The provisions of this Special Use District shall apply to the RH and RM zoned parcels within the area bounded by Bay Street on the north, The Embarcadero and Sansome Street on the east, Broadway on the South, and Columbus Avenue on the west, as shown on Sectional Map SU01 of the Zoning
Map.

C.

Controls.

1.

Number of Off-Street Residential Parking Spaces. Up to three cars for each four dwelling units is a Permitted use; up to one car for each dwelling unit requires a
Conditional use, subject to the criteria and procedures of Section 151.1(f); above
one car for each dwelling unit is Not Permitted.

2.

Installation of a Parking Garage. Installation of a garage in an existing residential building of four or more units requires a mandatory discretionary review hearing by the Planning Commission; Section 311 notice is required for a building of less

1

than four units. In approving installation of the garage, the Commission shall
find that: (1) the proposed garage opening/addition of off-street parking will not cause the "removal" or "conversion of residential unit," as those terms are defined in Section 317 of this Code; (2) the proposed garage opening/additiön of off- street parking will not substantially decrease the livability of a dwelling unit without increasing the floor area in a commensurate amount; (3) the building has not had two or more "no-fault" evictions, as defined in 37.9(a)(7)-(13) of the San Francisco Administrative Code, with each eviction associated with a separate unit(s) within the past ten years, (4) the garage would not front on a public right- of-way narrower than 41 feet, and (5) the proposed garage/addition of off-street parking installation is consistent with the Priority Policies of Section 101.1 of this
Code.

Prior to the Planning Commission hearing, or prior to issuance of notification under Section 311(c)(2) of this Code, the Planning Department shall require a signed affidavit by the project sponsor attesting to (1), (2), and (3) above, which the Department shall independently verify. The Department shall also have made a determination that the project complies with (4) and (5) above.

2016.08.09.4528 (Building Permit Application Number)
Telegraph Hill-North Beach Residential SUD (Special Use District)

Building Permit Application #2016.08.09.4528 has been received by the Planning Department and
assigned to planner Eiliesh Tuffy, Eiliesh has completed review of the application for corrective work to address Notice of Violation #201620916. The scope of work for the project as stated on the application is: "garage door correction per NOV 201620916- seal unpermitted garage door, relocate legal garage door to
center of ground floor."

Please be advised that the Planning Department has disapproved Building Permit Application No.
2016.08.09.4528. This notice is to alert the project sponsor of the process of review for the submitted
application and to convey the Department's findings that, due to restrictions enacted with the adoption of
the Telegraph Hill-North Beach Residential Special Use District in 2010, the Planning Department cannot
approve the proposed relocation of the existing garage door at the front façade of the existing residential
structure.

CEOA - Historical Review
The North Beach neighborhood was surveyed in 1982 to identify cultural resources of significance in the
area. The findings of the North Beach survey, which was adopted by the Board of Supervisors in 1999,
included areas within the neighborhood that qualified for designation in the California Register of
Historical Resources. The subject property at 20 Nobles Alley is located within the boundaries of the Upper Grant Avenue Historic District, but was not found to a be a contributing building to the district at the time of the survey due to its extensive alterations. Visible alterations to "Non-Contributing" buildings
are typically reviewed for their general compatibility with the surrounding district.

The Historical Review of the design proposal determined that the existing two-garage door design could
not be supported because it would not conform to Sec. 144 of the Planning Code, which limits garage openings to no more than one-third of the width of the ground story along the front lot line. However,
because some historic buildings in the historic district have single garage door entrances of a modest scale, the removal of the second unpermitted garage door and restoration of a prior man-door a and
window opening was reviewed as a means of returning the ground floor design to a more historic
appearance. This determination was predicated on the sponsor's ability to provide evidence of the single garage door's legal installation.

Building Permit Review Building permits and plans were reviewed to determine a record of work at the property. Plans
associated with permit applications (nos. 9723784 and 9723786) filed in 1997 to remove kitchens, remove
interior, non-load bearing wall and combine units 20 and 20A into one unit," show a single garage opening. However, the creation of a ground floor garage was not part of the approved project scope for
that permit or any other permit on file with the Department of Building Inspection. Similarly, there are no
permits on file that approved the creation of a second garage door opening at the subject property.
Lacking any evidence of the legal construction of the ground floor garage doors, the proposal to "seal
unpermitted garage door, relocate legal garage door to center of ground floor" was reviewed as a "new"
garage installation in an existing residential structure.

Planning Code Review
The Planning Code Review determined that legalization of either a 2-door garage or a 1-door garage at
the subject property would not meet the requirements of Section 144 and Section 249.49 of the Planning
Code, with the latter code section preventing the installation of new garages in existing residential
structures.

SEC. 144 - STREET FRONTAGES IN RH, RTO, RTO-M, AND RM DISTRICTS.
Section 144(b)(1) Entrances to Off-Street Parking
Except as otherwise provided herein, in the case of every dwelling in such districts no more than one-
third of the width of the ground story along the front lot line, or along a street side lot line, or along
building wall that is set back from any such lot line, shall be devoted to entrances to off-street parking,
except that in no event shall a lot be limited by this requirement to a single such entrance of less than ten
feet in width, or to a single such entrance of less than 8 feet in RTO and RTO-M districts. In addition, no
entrance to off-street parking on any lot shall be wider than 20 feet, and where two or more separate
entrances are provided there shall be a minimum separation between such entrances of six feet. Lots in
RTO and RTO-M districts are limited to a total of 20 feet per block frontage devoted to entrances to off-
street parking. Street-facing garage structures and garage doors may not extend closer to the street than a primary building facade unless the garage structure and garage door are consistent with the features
listed in Section 136 of this Code. Entrances to off-street parking shall be located at least six feet from a lot
corner located at the intersection of two public rights-of-way.

SEC. 249.49. TELEGRAPH HILL - NORTH BEACH RESIDENTIAL SPECIAL USE DISTRICT.
Section 249.49(a) Purposes.
To regulate off-street parking and the installation of garages in existing residential structures in order to ensure that they do not significantly increase the level of automobile traffic, increase pollution, or impair
pedestrian use on narrow public rights-of-way in the District; and to prevent the ability to add parking
from providing an incentive to convert existing residential buildings from rental buildings to tenancies-

The project proposes to install a new garage door at the front façade of an existing residential building
located on an alley narrower than 41 feet in the Telegraph Hill-North Beach Residential Special Use
District, Therefore, the Planning Department cannot approve permit application #2016.08.09.4528 to seal unpermitted garage door, relocate legal garage door to center of ground floor. Permit application #2016.08.09.4528 will be returned to the Department of Building Inspection for cancellation.
Please note that, due to the Notice of Violation on the property, the Enforcement case for this property will remain active until the project sponsor submits an application to abate the violation. Please contact the assigned Enforcement staff planner, Chaska Berger, by phone at 415-575-9188 or by email at chaska.berger@sfgov.org regarding timeframes for submitting materials to address the Notice of
Violation.

Planning Department & Planning Commission Denials.
Project sponsors seeking to appeal the denial of a permit application by the Planning Department or Commission may not filed an appeal until the Department of Building Inspection (DBI) issues the Notice of Disapproval for the project. The appeal must be filed within 15 calendar days from the date of DBI's Notice of Disapproval. A copy of the following documents must be submitted to Board staff: (a) the building permit application that was denied, with notation by Planning Staff on the back; and (b) the
Notice of Disapproval that was issued by DBI.

For further information regarding how to appeal the disapproval of this building permit application, please contact the Board of Appeals located at 1650 Mission Street, Room 304, San Francisco, or call (415)

BOARD OF APPEALS
AO SOUNT

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR PARTIES 4A3UIA

APPROVED PLANS
Permit holders whose building permits have been appealed are strongly encouraged to submit reduced copies of the City-approved plans for the subject project no later than one Thursday prior to the scheduled hearing. If plans are not submitted and the Board needs the plans to make its decision, the resolution of the appeal may be delayed. Eleven sets should be submitted to the Board office, reduced to a legible size (such as 11" x 17") and one additional set should be delivered to the other parties on the same date. An electronic copy should be sent to:
boardofappeals@sfgov.org.

WRITTEN & ORAL ARGUMENTS
Parties are encouraged, but not required, to submit a written statement (called a "brief") to the Board describing the dispute at issue, outlining their arguments and what action they'd like the Board to take. At the hearing, parties are given time to present their arguments orally to the Board.
Please consider the following information and instructions for written and oral arguments, and written
submittals:
Keep in mind the correct standard of review the Board will use in deciding the case. For most appeals, the Board applies de novo review, which means it hears the case fresh and does not need to defer to the findings of fact or determinations made by the underlying
decision-maker.

• Decisions by the Zoning Administrator (ZA), other than Variance decisions, require that the
Board defer to the ZA unless the Board finds that the ZA erred or abused his or her
discretion. Variance decisions are decided under the de novo standard described above.
In deciding a case, the Board may only uphold, overturn or place conditions on a departmental decision; it cannot remand (send back) decision to the underlying department for further review or action.
Jurisdiction Requests: To grant late jurisdiction, the Board must find that the City intentionally or inadvertently caused the requestor to be late in filing the appeal. If a Jurisdiction Request is granted, the requestor will have five days from the date of the
Board's decision to file an appeal.
Rehearing Requests: The Board may grant a rehearing in extraordinary cases to prevent manifest injustice, or where new or different facts or circumstances have arisen that if known at the time of the original hearing could have affected the outcome of the hearing. The written request should state the nature and character of the new facts or circumstances, the names of the witnesses and/or a description of the documents to be produced, and why the evidence was not produced at the original hearing.

Phone: 415-575-6880 • Fax: 415-575-6885 • Email: boardofappeals@sfgov.org
www.sfaov.ora/boa

Consider the votes needed.
Appeals: In most cases, an appellant must get four out of the five Board members to vote to overturn or modify a departmental decision. it That means it takes the vote of two Board
members for the underlying departmental decision to remain unchanged.

• Jurisdiction Requests and Rehearing Requests: Four out of five votes are needed to
a Jurisdiction Request or Rehearing Request. grant

Explain what action you'd like the Board to take. The type of action requested will depend
upon the nature of the appeal and the party submitting the brief. Some examples include:
Protest Appeals - when someone objects to a permit or other entitlement issued to
someone else:

o An appellant in a protest appeal typically requests either that the entitlement be denied, or new conditions be placed on the entitlement so that the project is changed in some way
(example: new construction be set back further from the appellant's property line).
o A permit holder in this type of case typically requests that the Board uphold the entitlement as is, with no new conditions.
Appeals of a Denial, Revocation, Condition, Suspension or Penalty:

0 An appellant who appeals the denial or revocation of his or her own permit typically asks
the Board to overturn the denial or revocation.
o An appeal of conditions placed on a permit seeks to eliminate or modify the conditions.
o An appeal of a permit suspension or penalty seeks to eliminate or reduce the length of the suspension or the amount of the penalty. Note that in many cases, there is a statutory
limit that prevents the Board from completely eliminating a penalty.
Follow the Board's formatting requirements for written submittals. The Rules of the Board of Appeals set out very specific requirements with respect to the length of briefs for different types of cases and how they need to look on the page. Briets that donit meet these requirements may be rejected.

The subject property under review at 20 Nobles Alley is a 2-story-over-basement, flat-front wood-frame vernacular building containing three dwelling units. Based on plans dated The south elevation has 26'-9" of bullding frontage along the north side of Nobles Alley. Sanborn maps of the area indicate that prior to the 1906 earthquake and fire, the subject a lot had a 1-story dwelling facing Nobles Alley with a 1-story bakery immediately behind the residential dwelling. In 1905 the property held the address of 9 Noble Alley. By 1915, following the area's post-earthquake period of reconstruction, the existing building had been constructed on the subject lot, was identified as 20 Noble Alley, and housed 2 apartment flats in the front structure and 2 flats at the rear. The width of the street on the 1915 Sanborn map is shown to be 16 feet.
In 1982, an architectural survey was conducted of the North Beach neighborhood which included Nobles Alley and the subject property. As a result of that survey, the Upper Grant Historic District was identified as a National Register-eligible district under CEQA. The district runs along the Grant Avenue commercial corridor and includes residential parcels to the east and west, from Medau Place at the northern boundary to Fresno Street and
/ Columbus Avenue at the southern boundary. The district was identified as significant for its land use pattern of densely-built streets that are indicative of the city's early urban development, for the close proximity of commercial and residential development, for its vernacular building types constructed immediately following the 1906 earthquake, and for its association with the following themes: Economic/Industrial and Social/Education primarily related to the history of various ethnic communities in the area. In total, nine properties line the north and south sides of Nobles Alley. At the end of the alley, partial rear elevations of two additional properties are also visible. The survey noted 6 properties with frontage on Nobles Alley as contributors to the historic district: #2,#15 and #21-25 Nobles Alley, #1508-1512 and #1522-1526 Grant Ave., and #478-482 Union St. While the subject property is a vernacular residential building constructed immediately following the earthquake, it was not identified at the time of the 1982 survey as a contributor to the
historic district.

Currently, the ground floor includes 1 man-door, 1 window & 2 garage doors. The project proposes to remove 1 non-historic window, 2 wall vent openings & 1 garage door. (cont'd)

Case No. 2016-014104ENV

The project would restore the ground floor façade in the proposed areas of work to a prior condition,
based on historic photographic documentation that is included on Sheet A5.1 of the plan set.
As proposed, the scope of work is in accordance with Standard #6 of the National Park Service's
Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation, which states:
Standard 6. Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the
severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall
match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials.
Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial
evidence.

The ground floor wall areas proposed for rehabilitation, which includes the removal of two non-historic
wall vent openings, would be clad in stucco to match the existing façade cladding in material and finish.
The proposed wood man-door and wood double-hung window are compatible with the door and
window that previously existed at that ground floor location, based on historic photos.

Based on the details provided in the plan set, the project returns the subject property to a documented
prior condition using exterior cladding and fenestration that is compatible with the district's period of
significance. Therefore, pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act, the project would not
cause a substantial material impact to the Upper Grant Historic District.

DESCRIPTION
7a. Architectural style: vernacular Classic
7b. Briefly describe the present physical description of the site or structure and describe any major alterations from its
original condition: The upper Grant Avenue District consists of a neighborhood shopping street end ite eurrounding streeteful of apartments and flats, all less than one block distant from the narrow shopping street, Grant Avenue. The neighborhood is densely packed, both in plan: by two or three very narrow alleys added to each block of the city's rectangular grid; and in architecture: by sidewalk-hugging,
and nary an multipie-unit adjoining buildings open space except the streets themselves. Most buildings are 3-story-&-basement vernacular Classic frames; those on the main streets have bay windows, those on alleye do not. On Grant Avenue and a little way on some cross streets, ground floors were built to house etores with plate-glass windows, transom strips of windows, bases and posts, and a V-shaped recessed entry which increases show window spaces and invites oustomers inside. Since the ground varies from nearly level, especially on Grant Avenue, to quite steep, the non-store buildings stand on raised basements usually faced with concrete imitating rusticated stone. Stairs
may lead to a recessed entry with doors to individual flate, or a facade

SIGNIFICANCE 19. Briefly state historical and/or architectural importance (include dates, events, and persons associated with the site.) The upper Grant Avenue district is significant because of ite historical land use pattern, recreated after the 1906 fire and ensentially unchanged today from the earliest development: a tightly packed area of interde- pendent housing and small shops serving the community with basic services and ethnic specialties. The pattern consists of a narrow main street and even narrower alleys, all filled with side-by-side 2-8 unit, 3-story vernacular Classic buildings on smell lots--smalier lots and simpler ornamentation on alleys and slightly larger lots with bays and more or- namentation on city grid streets--and of similar buildings with residen- tial upper stories und ground-floor ehope on and near Grant Avenue. It was and is a "busy" place, with emphasis on foot traffic. It reflects the crowded living conditions typically experienced by recent immigrante. The area has always had an "ethnic" quality: a mixture of Germans, Italians, Latin Americans and French in 1880, Italians after 1900, and Asian-Americane today, In the 20th century the emall apartments and low rents began to attract Bohemians and literati who enjoyed the ethnic atmosphere and inexpensive ethnic restaurants, standard employment Locational sketch map (draw and label site and

ITEM 7b. (cont.) plane entry may lead to a central staircase giving onto the various apartments. Most buildinge were constructed 1906-1910, hardly any after 1929, so that all have falso fronte and overhanging cornices. Most intrusions are merely insensitive remodelings of the basic fabric and capanble of restoration.

ITEN 19. (cont.) There also came into being businesses catering to the would-be artists and writers: bars and various ga thering places, especially during upper Grant's most notorious years, the Beatnik era of the late 1950g. There is no other area in San Francinco like the upper Grant district, with its cohesiveness of architecture, ethnic atmosphere and visual rhythm of streets. One knowns one is ie North Beach.

September 27, 2107

Dear Board President Breed,
Thank you for accepting this appeal of the above referenced categorical exemption for consideration, discussion and vote by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.

I. Introduction
My name is Marc Bruno and my 600 square foot residence is 15 Nobles Alley, San Francisco, across the street and 25 feet to the west of the subject property, 20 Nobles Alley. My northward facing windows face the subject property. The entrance to my
apartment requires me to access a door a fronting Nobles Alley, 38 feet southwest of the

proposed project: the new construction and/or modification and legalization of a garage and/or garages at 20 Nobles. These various proposals all have been proposed under the same permit, the permit on which the subject Categorical Exemption is based.
On or about June 1, 2017, I filed a complaint with the City and County of San Francisco concerning two illegal, un-permitted garages at 20 Nobles Alley. I am the Complainant in
the matter. As a consequence of the Building Department determining on or about August
2, 2016 that the subject garages were in fact illegal-- no permit, plans, approvals nor job
cards for such garages ever having been found-- the property owners received an N.O.V.
prior to purchasing the building and as a result applied for a permit to "Seal unpermitted
garage door, relocate legal garage door to center of ground floor."
As neither garage door was ever found to be legal, it is impossible to know from this permit description what is meant by "legal garage door."

II. Objection to and Appeal of Categorical Exemption 2016-014104ENV

Please know that by this email, delivered today by hard copy as well, I notify you that object to and appeal the attached Categorical Exemption for 20 Nobles Alley, San Francisco, California, Block / Lot 0104/025; Case Number 2016-014104ENV. The
review on which the Categorical Exemption is based is the review of Building Permit Application 201608094528, which was appealed by the permit-holders (subsequent to the N.O.V. and Planning Department Disapproval) to the San Francisco Board of Appeals, a matter heard by that Board on July 12, 2017 and September 13, 2017 (Appeal 17-088).

III. Planning Department Email rationalizing "Categorical Exemption" at 20
Nobles Alley

In an attempt to explain to Marc Bruno, the appellant herein, the rationale for awarding permit-holders a Categorical Exemption based on plans submitted by them that contradict their own permit (Permit Application 201608094528), City Planner Eiliesh Tuffy, in an
email dated September 18, 2017, states the following:

"Fr Tuffy, Eiliesh (CPC) <eiliesh.tuffy@sfgov.org> To Marc Bruno
CC Silva, Christine (CPC) Sanchez, Scott (CPC) Tam, Tina (CPC) Sep 18 at 5:57 PM
Dear Mr. Bruno,

Standards for CEOA Review
a Alterations to a building within the district, whether found to be contributing or non-
contributing at the time of the survey, are evaluated for CEQA conformance using the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. The Standards apply to publicly visible exterior alterations on otherwise private property.
CEQA review is limited to the proposed scope of work, and what impact - if any - the
work would have on the historic integrity of the historic resource.

2

JL

The historic resource in the case of 20 Nobles is the entirety of the Upper Grant Avenue
Historic District.
The proposal to remove unapproved door, window and vent openings from the publicly visible façade of 20 Nobles -- because it was restorative in nature and was based on documented pictorial evidence qualified for a Categorical Exemption from CEQA under Standard 6:
'6. Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or
pictorial evidence.'
The scope of work for this project did not require new evaluative analysis of the property's historic status, as the work proposes to remove unpermitted alterations and bring the façade back to a more historic appearance.
Sincerely,
Eiliesh Tuffy, Planner/Preservation Specialist"

IV. A Categorical Exemption at 20 Nobles Alley based on the above-referenced Interior Department "Rehabilitation Standards" is a misapplication of Federal
Law and Policy, and therefore should be Overturned

IV. (1.) The department's Categorical Exemption is misapplied at 20 Nobles Alley because it is inconsistent with law, practice and policy. Nothing in the Secretary of Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation of Historic Structures encourages, permits, recognizes
or condones the legalization of an illegally built addition that as of the day of the Categorical Exemption never had been made legal by any governmental agency, inspection process or review board.
That is particularly true here, where, a as a consequence of the illegal addition- illegal garages built in 1997 or 1998 up to and including the day Planner Tuffy issued the Exemption- the historic integrity of the building, and the historic integrity of the immediate neighborhood and of the North Beach Historic District itself were all damaged by the very act of the garages being illegally installed in the first place.
Garages built without plans, without permits, without input from the neighborhood. Without even an inkling of a request for approval by any city agency or department. Garages that do not conform to the history and style of the building, the alley, the neighborhood or the historic district.

3

2

Planner Tuffy takes the liberty of taking permit-holders at face value when they label these garages (or, at least, one of them) "legal". There is no basis in the law or
public policy for her doing so.
Both garages were illegal on the day of the Categorical Exemption, September 8, 2017. As illegal as the day they were built. Ms. Tuffy's fellow City Planner, Zoning Administrator Scott Sanchez, confirms this before the Board of Appeals on July 12, 2017. And in Ms. Tuffy's own "Notice of Disapproval" (May 8, 2017), she states unequivocally the garages never went through any form of permitting and were therefore illegal. (Attached, "Notice of Planning Department Disapproval," p. 2)
Scott Sanchez Testimony regarding legality of garages at 20 Nobles, Board of Appeals Meeting 07.12.17, Time Code 1:57:13, Appeal # 17-088:
Zoning Administrator Scott Sanchez:
"There was never a permit as a garage. There was a permit from the late '90s that showed an existing garage. But there was no permit adding that."
Board of Appeals President Darryl Honda: "But there was an existing garage there at one time, right?"
Sanchez:
"Not legally. So, we have a member of the public, Mr. Bruno, who I believe can provide more information. We have a photo from the early '90s showing no
garage, no garage in this building."
Honda:
"Okay."
Sanchez:
"Then there's a permit from the late '90s showing an existing garage. Existing condition. Magically appearing as an existing condition. There's no evidence of any permit from the date of that photo until the date of the permit that shows it as an existing condition. There is no evidence of any permit establishing that garage. And then, beyond that, they went ahead to install a second garage without any permits."
The categorical exemption is ill-considered and unjustified because it is based on a plan that falsely labels the existing condition on the property the exact opposite of
what it is: illegal.
The permit holders at 20 Nobles Alley consistently write on their plans, their permit applications and on their appeal to the Board of Appeals, "legal garage," as if saying so enough times will make it true. This is no different than appearing with expensive movie cameras in another country and shouting at people in English to get out of the way, even though nobody there speaks English (nor should).

4

All the elaborate recording instruments and all the shouting in the world doesn't change the fact that on the day of the Categorical Exemption the garages at 20 Nobles were deemed illegal by every city agency and department that investigated them. And had been illegal since the day they were built almost 20 years before.
They were deemed illegal by Building Department Inspector Maurizio Hernandez, after extensive research. They were deemed illegal by the Department of Public Works upon the request by the current owners for a curb cut in 2016. And they were deemed illegal by Ms. Tuffy herself in the Planning Department Notice of Disapproval of the project ("Notice of Planning Department Disapproval," May 8, 2017, addressed to Eustache and Dudley de St. Phalle).
It is obvious that permit-holders do not want to admit they bought 20 Nobles Alley
completely aware-- and made aware in-person by the City-- of purchasing two illegal garages. In an Enforcement Division DBI Director's Hearing January 17, 2017 (a hearing ] attended), inspectors had to repeat their question concerning this issue to the permit-holders five times: "Did you know about this problem before buying the building?" It was only after grilling them that the permit-holders admitted to having pre-sale knowledge of the illegal garages.

IV. (2.) The assumption that a garage might remain at 20 Nobles as part of a plan to "rehabilitate" the building contradicts the Interior Secretary's Guidelines for implementation of the Interior Department's Rehabilitation Standards. Such garage
or garages, even with the so-called rehabilitation of two apertures attempting to duplicate the facade shown in a 1958 photo of the building (the building was constructed 52 years earlier), contradict those sections of the Guidelines addressing
"Wood," "Masonry," "Entrances" and "New Additions" to historic buildings. (Each is
a separate section of the Guidelines.)
In the Not Recommended chapter of the "Entrances" section of the Guidelines, for
instance, the Secretary warns,
"A. Cutting new entrances on a primary elevation is not recommended. B. Altering utilitarian or service entrances so they appear to be formal entrances by
adding paneled doors, fanlights, and sidelights is not recommended." is
Yet this is exactly what City Planner Tuffy would be allowing the permit-holders to
do at 20 Nobles Alley, were the Categorical Exemption not overturned. All as an excuse to build a garage where the City and its elected officials have long since legislated that no such garages should be. (City Planning Code, Section 249.49)
In the "New Additions," Not Recommended chapter of the Guidelines, the Secretary
warns,

"D. Imitating a historic style or period of architecture in new additions, especially for contemporary uses such as drive-in banks or garages is not recommended."

5

While it is obvious the Secretary is here referring to the preservation of both commercial and residential buildings, the not recommended label is no less relevant to 20 Nobles. Under the rubric of a "categorical exemption," an ersatz restoration would be permitted, only for the sake of a garage, which is itself an expressly "not recommended" addition to the facade.
The only way for the City to prevent this-- and to be consistent with the Secretary's Standards and Guidelines-- is for the Board of Supervisors to decisively overturn the categorical exemption and apply nothing less than a mitigated negative declaration to a review of the project at 20 Nobles Alley.

IV.3.
The garage at 20 Nobles, under a Categorical Exemption, also would be non- conforming with the neighborhood. For this and the additional reasons here listed,

- such a structure, build out and curb cut would contradict the Planning Department's
own Guidelines for Adding Garages and Curb Cuts, Zoning Administrator Bulletin Nos. 2006.1a and 2006.1b.

IV 4.
The remaining garage door also undermines express provisions of the Planning Code, specifically Section 249.49, passed by the elected officials of the City and County of San Francisco in 2010, which read, in part,
"Purposes. To regulate off-street parking and the installation of garages in existing residential structures in order to ensure that they do not significantly increase the
level of automobile traffic, increase pollution, nor impair pedestrian use on narrow
public rights- of-way." San Francisco Planning Code Section 249.49
Neither CEQA nor the Secretary of Interior's Rehabilitation Standards contemplate the use of state and federal law to overturn local legislation, especially when, as here, the express purpose of that local legislation is to embrace and adopt for local purposes the goals of national and state environmental policy. To educate. To conserve. To better know. To enhance. To honor and respect the physical and cultural environment in all its stunningly beautiful forms.
Were a "categorical exemption" to be used to install a garage at 20 Nobles Alley, where no legal garage had ever before existed, the 2010 legislation drafted and passed by the City's elected officials to deliberately block such structures would be undermined, and the Supervisors' intentions circumvented by administrative fiat.
Further, no plans were ever submitted for public review of the project until just before the second and final hearing on it-- September 13, 2017. This severe lack of transparency is evidence of a planning process that contradicts one of the primary purpose of environmental review: Public input in open forums noticed to the

6

12.

community in a meaningful and timely manner. The City's failure to reveal the plans for this project in a timely manner is a violation of public records laws, including the City's Sunshine Ordinance. The records were available to the City and requested by me and others for over one year before they were ever made available. The plans finally given to us by the Department and permit-holders were not the original plans-- not the plans we asked for-- as they are dated more than one year later.
V. San Francisco Elected Officials, as well as representatives of the City's Planning Department, have expressed the views of the community at-large regarding the environmental fragility and cultural significance of 20 Nobles Alley. They have done this in notices of determination, reports, surveys,
letters of advice, and amendments to the Planning Code, including the
passage in 2010 of Planning Code $8 249.49 et, seg.
Were the Department to allow one or more garages in the narrow space fronting 20 Nobles, or permit the building of new garage there, it would effectively circumvent the express purposes of Planning Code §§ 249.49 et, seq. (2010). Planning Department rep Scott Sanchez labeled this ordinance "confusing" at the July 12, 2017 Board of Appeals hearing, but the Code is not at all confusing when it comes to the purposes of the law:
"San Francisco Planning Code Section 249.49. Purposes. To regulate off-street parking and the installation of garages in existing residential structures in order to ensure that they do not significantly increase the level of automobile traffic, increase pollution, or impair pedestrian use on narrow public rights- of-way in the District; and to prevent the ability to add parking from providing an incentive to convert residential buildings from rental buildings to tenancies-in-common."
To regulate. To decrease pollution. To protect rental units. That is directly from the law as written. What "narrow public right of way" in the entire City of San Francisco is narrower than the sidewalks adjacent to and across from 20 Nobles Alley? You will not
find them. Sidewalks traversed hourly by residents of the alley who enter and exit 45

*: units accessible only via Nobles Alley.
The City has cited the permit-holders of this property for illegally using 20 Nobles for Short Term Rentals in a manner prohibited by the Short Term Rental Control Ordinance (Administrative Code Chapter 41 (A)). As it is recognized that such short term rentals-- especially illegal ones, as here-- have an adverse effect on the availability of rental properties for San Francisco residents, to legalize a garage here undoes what the City's elected legislative body has chosen in this and other legislation to do, to support and encourage a housing stock of variably priced rental properties that are open and available to all residents, be they homeless, poor or middle-class.
Prior property owners and other interested parties (for instance, the City itself) had the means at their disposal to initiate action to legalize the un-permitted garages at 20 Nobles in a timely manner, for more than ten years up to and including December 31, 2010, the day prior to the City's implementing Planning Code Section 249.49.

7

12

The burden of the negligence in this respect-- of a continued lack of interest in legalizing what these prior owners must have known was illegal--- must fall on them rather than on
the neighborhood as a whole. In this regard, Streets Use and Mapping has noted that there never has been a curb cut at this address, a clear indication that the garages were known
to be illegal by everyone who took possession of the property.
The current property owners, while innocent of the installation of the illegal garages in 1998, were told in person by Building Inspector Mauricio Hernandez and other DBI reps
prior to their purchase of the building that the garages were unpermitted and illegal. The
current owners also received a formal "Notice of Violation" tacked to the building stating these facts, prior to their purchase of the property. For these same owners to come before the City's Appeal Board (just three months after being cited for illegal short term rentals) and ask that they be given a garage in an alleyway were garages are now prohibited (under Planning Code 249.49) is unwarranted and insulting.
If the elected members of the Board of Supervisors chose to add exceptions to the 2010 amendment to the Code, Section 249.49, exceptions, for instance, for "unused garages," "illegal garages, "un-permitted garages" "obstructive garages" "unsightly garages" or "historically anachronistic garages" (all of which accurately describe the illegal garages at 20 Nobles Alley), the Board of Supervisors in 2010 would have included such language as part of the Ordinance. They choose not to for good reason, and public policy now dictates that the Planning Department follow the lead of your predecessor Board and prohibit garages in this alley.
VI. Historic Significance of 20 Nobles Alley. Nobles Alley in its entirety and
the North Beach Historic District
As noted in the City's own review, the two buildings located at 20 Nobles are "Class A" contributors to the Historic District. The City has, by its own words at the Board of Appeals, by its website and by the attached "Categorical Exemption" made it increasingly difficult if not impossible to understand whether 20 Nobles is or is not a "contributor," what the City means by "contributor" and what category of contribution this entails. This confusion is so extreme that at the hearing of July 12, 2017, on this very subject, the single architect on the Board of Appeals, Mr. Frank Fung, was left with the impression by the City that the building might be considered a "B" contributor, even though here, by writing, and just two months later, 2016-014104ENV labels the property an "A."
This confusion has a profound effect on the ability of neighbors to participate in a review of the project and is once again evidence of a process out of synch with CEQA and other policies requiring environmental review.
As noted by Mr. Albert Yee, whose sworn testimony before the Board of Appeals is attached, no changes were ever made to the property during the ownership and tenancy of the property by his family (1958 - 1997), with the exception of the application of a stucco frontage to one of the two buildings there, this frontage being applied in a careful manner to preserve and not alter the existing redwood siding, beveled, that is still on the face of
the building and has never been removed.

Mr. Yee also notes in his testimony that neither he nor any member of his family has ever been contacted by the Planning Department, or by other City agencies to ascertain the cultural value or architectural history of the buildings at 20 Nobles, an error in applying CEQA requirements to this review. His family was part of a significant vanguard of Chinese land-owners in North Beach who achieved a number of "firsts" that must be recognized by the City at-large and by any reasonable environmental review.
Even if Planning Department reviewer Eiliesh Tuffy, the City Planner who wrote the attached report labeling 20 Nobles Alley 'categorically exempt' has completed all 'paper trail review' requirements (City phone books, reverse address directories, Sanborn Maps, etc.) even then, the City is obligated to personally contact former owners of the property when those owners, as is the case here, have made themselves available to planners and have significant narrative to add to the planner's understanding of the historical, architectural and cultural value of a property and district.
To legalize one or more of those garages in this narrow-space, or to permit the building of a new garage, is to necessarily have a negative impact on the natural environment, the historic context of the property and the cumulative effect of this and the surrounding structures that make 20 Nobles part of a vivid and significant portrait of San Francisco, the adjacent block of Grant Avenue, North Beach, and, indeed, the nation at-large. A notable and uniquely preserved architectural gem in America.
VII. The Plain Meaning Interpretation of the California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA) requires environmental review at 20 Nobles Alley

I base my appeal of the above referenced Categorical Exemption on the language and plain meaning interpretation of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), to wit, that CEQA provides that a project "may not be categorically exempt from further environmental review if substantial evidence in the record supports a fair argument that the project may have a significant effect on the environment."
Among other causes, this project will have substantial effect on the natural environment because it would it add a legal garage at the end of an 11' wide alleyway, circumscribed tightly by three adjacent apartment buildings and located in one of the most densely populated blocks of the City, used constantly by pedestrian traffic traversing a tightly knit matrix of historic buildings, with little or no available green space, public or private.
(The ratio of residents to green space in the four block area surrounding Nobles Alley is one of the highest ratios in the City and County of San Francisco. If, in addition to this four block area, the residents and visitors to Chinatown are included, a 16-block area, the ratio of people-to-open space parkland is the worst-- that is, least green space available-- in the entire state of California.)
Vehicular traffic is projected to rise, based on increased tourism, reverse-commute tech workers who live in this and adjacent blocks on Grant Avenue and travel by jitney, car share and other means to places of work in Silicon Valley. The area is frequented as well by users of AirBnB and other short-term rental programs adding to the density and
frequency of intermittent travel made by tourists to and from the adjacent blocks.

2

Additionally, CEQA Guidelines Section 15300.2 provides that a project "shall not be exempt from environmental review if the project may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historic resource or where the project may contribute to a cumulative impact on a historic district."
That would be the precise impact of allowing a garage at 20 Nobles Alley. As was pointed out by numerous witnesses and by in-person testimony offered by sworn witnesses at the aforementioned hearings, the current illegal garages have never been used. To make one or both of the garages "legal" at 20 Nobles is to make them usable. To effectively add a garage in a historic North Beach structure, namely, 20 Nobles, contrary
to the Secretary of Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation, cited above, among other provisions of this and other state and national environmental laws.
VIII. CONCLUSION

1 The burden of a new or legalized garage or garages falls squarely on the shoulders of the property owners who purchased the building knowing full well it had no legal garages. Their desire for a garage at this late date should not supersede the neighborhood's needs-- nor the provisions of local, state and federal law guaranteeing something that all urban dwellers strive to create, cherish and protect: A clean environment, a vibrant and diverse culture, a respect for historic resources and a fostering of our streets and sidewalks to meet our ever-growing pedestrian needs.
Nobles Alley is an intimate and unusual urban space, a narrow and steep ascent marked by historic integrity, cultural diversity, physical serenity and grace. We ask that CEQA be applied with due process and environmental justice to this corner of the City. We demand as renters and residents, businesses and property owners, old and young that a robust and responsive review-- not a "categorical exemption" but, at the very least, a mitigated negative declaration--be applied as the standard of review at 20 Nobles.
Whether a garage is built from scratch or "legalized," refurbished into existence or, in the mysterious words of the permit-holders, "move legal garage to center"-fied, the effect on the existing neighborhood, and on limited transportation and cultural resources, is the same. An effect that cannot be comprehended nor integrated into the matrix of this Special Use and Historic District without a meaningful application of CEQA.
Thank you for your considered attention and discussion of this appeal.

November 3, 2017 B.O.S. File 177053, 20 Nobles Alley

INTRODUCTION-ADDITIONAL SUBMISSIONS

We are appealing the categorical exemption for this project, File number 171053, a Special Order to be heard on November 14, 2017

As there is an Ethics Complaint regarding the vote on this project before the Board of Appeals on September 13, 2017 we respectfully request that the hearing before the B.O.S. be continued until the Ethics Commission completes
its investigation.

We have presented a well-documented case to the Ethics Commission that
Commissioner Richard Swig of the San Francisco Board of Appeals was under Ethics Code requirements to recuse himself from voting on this matter. This case is described in detail in the attached Ethics Complaint (1718-026).

We also presented a well-documented case that Commissioner Swig was
required to disclose his relationship with the expediter for this project, 20
Nobles, a man who also serves on the San Francisco Board of Examiners and
has rented his sole business office space from Mr. Swig since 1988.

As the vote before the Board of Appeals on September 13th was 4-to-1,
•Commissioner Swig's recusal would have meant that the Board turned down the project sponsors' appeal, and we would not be here today asking for a reconsideration of the categorical exemption.

Sincerely,

Marc Bruno

17 SEP 29 PM 4:07 Conflict of Interest Complaint, Board of Appeals Member FRANCISCO Complainant: Marc Bruno Respondent: Richard SwigiCS COMMISSION
I. Complaint Summary BY

Mr. Richard Swig, a Board Member of the San Francisco Board of Appeals, failed to disclose his business relationships with two parties who appeared before the Board of Appeals of behalf of Appeal 17-088, a matter deliberated and voted upon at the July 12, 2017 and September 13, 2017 meetings of the Board.
Mr. Swig also was required to recuse himself from voting on the matter in which these parties appeared. He did not do sO,
Failing to disclose his relationships with Mr. Eustache de St. Phalle, the appellant, and Patrick Buscovich, his representative, Mr. Swig violated and continues to violate Section 3.214 of the San Francisco Campaign and Governmental Conduct Code, commonly referred to as the City's Ethics Code.
Failing to recuse himself from voting on this appeal, Mr. Swig skewered a 4-to-1 vote in favor of two men with whom he has business relationships, benefitting them. Given the extent and nature of these relationships, the public could reasonably question the ability of Mr. Swig to act for its benefit.
Eustache de St Phalle's Business Relationship w. Board Member Richard Swig Mr. de St. Phalle is a lawyer and named partner in the firm Rains, Lucia, Stern, de St. Phalle and Silver. Since October 1, 2011, the firm maintains a San Francisco office, of
which Mr. de St. Phalle is the lead partner. That office is the entire 15th floor of 220 Montgomery Street, a building owned by Mr. Swig's family partnership. Mr. de St. Phalle's law firm has paid Swig LLC $18,770,640.

In 2011, the year that the firm opened the San Francisco, Mr. de St. Phalle, then with 2

another firm ("The Veen Firm") was named "Of counsel" in the same Press Release announcing the opening of the office in the Mills Building, In 2015, Mr. de St. Phalle joined the firm "Rains, Lucia and Stern" as a full-Partner, and his name was added to the marquee. From the time of Mr. de St. Phalle's becoming a named partner at the firm, the firm has paid Swig LLC approximately $6,250,880.
Patrick Buscovich's Business Relationship w. Board Member Richard Swig Patrick Buscovich & Associates has been a tenant at 235 Montgomery Street since
1998. Mr. Swig lists this building as a "source of rental income of $10,000 or more" on each and every Statement of Economic Interest (SEI) filed with the City's Ethics Commission from 2007 to 2017 (a total of seven SEl Reports). Mr. Buscovich, besides being a 19-year tenant at 235 Montgomery provided professional engineering services to the building. (Buscovich & Associate's website advertising this event, Attached.

Marc Bruno to San Francisco Ethics Commission

II. Facts
Mr. Richard Swig is an appointed member of the five member San Francisco Board of Appeals. He has served on this board for the years 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017.
Prior to this, Mr. Swig served on the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency Board,
another review body subject to the requirements of the San Francisco Campaign and Governmental Conduct Code, and 42 U.S. Code § 1983, for the years 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011.
Mr. Swig also has served on numerous other boards, commissions, advisory groups and task forces in San Francisco and in St. Helena, California, where Mr. Swig owns a home, an inn, a restaurant and other property.
Ethica Requirements, Board Members on the Board of Appeals
As part of the criteria to serve on the Board of Appeals in San Francisco, Mr. Swig agreed to attend bi-annual Ethics Training Classes provided by the San Francisco Office of the City Attorney, and to sign a Certificate of Ethics Training for each such class, pursuant to California Government Code section 53235 (AB 1234). Mr. Swig also agreed to attend bi-annual classes concerning the City's Sunshine Ordinance,
classes that also are sponsored by the City Attorney's Office. Finally, as required by the state's Fair Political Practices Commission, pursuant to the Political Reform Act of 1974 (Government Code § 87100 et seq.), Mr. Swig agreed to submit an annual report showing the sources of his income and the ownership of real property, the so-called "SEl Form 700," a Statement of Economic Interests.
The SEl Form requires that properties and business interests owned by Mr. Swig in San Francisco be reported. However, it seems that the SEI does not require that Mr. Swig report his properties and business interests in Napa Valley.
With the sole exception of a form where certain sections of the SEI are redacted, each and every SEI 700 Form Mr. Swig submitted to the City Ethics Commission
• includes his reference to 220 Montgomery Street (a.k.a, "the Mills Building") and
235 Montgomery Street (a.k.a. "the Russ Building"). These properties are listed in Mr. Swig's SEI reports at the top of a list entitled, "Additional Sources of Income of $10,000 or more for Swig Investment Company."
Typically, this list is the final page of each SEI report filed by Mr. Swig.
220 Montgomery Street-- the building where Mr. de St. Phalle has his law office as a
named partner in the firm of Rains, Lucia, Stern, de St. Phalle and Silver-- is also
listed separately, a second time, in each of the SEI Reports submitted by Mr. Swig. In
the case of 220 Montgomery, Mr. Swig also lists it under "Schedule B, Interests in
Real Property." Under the category "Nature of Interest?" Mr. Swig notes in each of his SEI reports that he has an "Ownership/ Deed of Trust" in 220 Montgomery.

2

12

Marc Bruno to San Francisco Ethics Commission
September 29, 2017
a Typically, this reference to a "Ownership/Deed of Trust" at 220 Montgomery is listed on page 4 of the Report, as it is in the 2016 Swig SEl Report. (Attached)
"Swig Investment Company" versus "Swig Company, LLC"
"Swig Company, LLC" is never mentioned in Board Member Swig's seven SEI 700 Forms. However, the following companies are mentioned by him as either owned by Mr. Swig, or, when not owned by him, contributing at least $10,000 annually to his income. The companies listed by Mr. Swig are:
Swig Investment Company
Richard L. Swig Trust
RSMC Investment Company
RSBA Associates
Article 3 Advisors
Not a Bad View, LLC

Although "Swig Company, LLC" is not mentioned in the Swig SEl reports, it seems that what Mr. Swig might mean by "Swig Investment Company" (the first company in this list) is "Swig Company, LLC." Mr. Swig states in his SEl reports that he owns 220 Montgomery as part of "Swig Investment Company." But the actual owner listed at the City Assessor-Recorder Office is "Swig Company, LLC." It is not impossible to conclude these are one in the same company, or, perhaps, co-partners.
Whatever financial instrument or corporate structure Mr. Swig uses as form of
ownership or "interest in,' the properties at 220 and 235 Montgomery provide legally significant income to him, for purposes of this ethics complaint. State Ethics Code (Form 700) requires that income from property $10,000 or more must be reported, and Mr. Swig has reported each of these properties on all seven reports.
Regular Duties of the Board Members who sit on the Board of Appeals R

As part of his duties on the San Francisco Board of Appeals, Mr. Swig is expected to consider appeals and related procedural matters that come before the Board, read materials presented by parties to those appeals, listen to in-person presentations made by those parties and their representatives, ask questions of parties to the appeals, participate in discussions with other Board members, and decide based on the official record a correct course of action in accordance with the law. When called upon by a duly made motion, Swig votes on these appeals and related procedural 3

matters.

The majority of appeals that come before the Board concern building permits.
The History of Appeal 17-088 before the Board of Appeals
Mr. Eustache de St. Phalle, an attorney, filed an appeal to the Board of Appeals on or about June 7, 2017. {Appeal 17-088) On or about this day, Dudley de St. Phalle, Mr.

3

12

Marc Bruno to San Francisco Ethics Commission
September 29, 2017
de St. Phalle's wife, filed a seven-page brief to the Board asking it to overturn a decision made by the San Francisco Planning Department that a proposed garage at 20 Nobles Alley, a building owned by the de St. Phalles, be "disapproved." The de St. Phalle's appeal was scheduled to be heard July 12, 2017 in San Francisco City Hall, Room 466, at which time and place Mr. de St. Phalle and his wife, Dudley de St.
Phalle, appeared before the Board.
The first line of the brief presented by Ms. Dudley de St. Phalle referenced Mr. de St. Phalle's co-ownership of the property; to wit, "My husband, Eustache de St. Phalle, and I bought the building at 20 Nobles Alley last summer."
At the meeting of the Board of Appeals on July 12, 2017, the following parties made presentations: Zoning Administrator Scott Sanchez, Planning Department; Bernie Curran, Department of Building Inspection; Dudley de St. Phalle; Patrick Buscovich, (representing appellants); Mr. Marc Bruno, a resident neighbor (and author of this complaint) and Mr. Brent McDonald, a resident neighbor and architect.
Mr. Sanchez, Mr. Curran, Mr. Bruno and Mr. McDonald spoke in favor of the Planning Department's "Notice to Disapprove." Appellant de St. Phalles and Mr. Buscovich spoke in opposition to the Planning Department disapproval.
de St. Phalle's appeal was discussed and voted on by Mr. Swig and other members of the Board of Appeals on July 12. The Board voted unanimously to continue the matter until September 13, 2017, because it was made known during deliberations that contrary to Board Rules and Regulations no building plans had been submitted to the Board. (San Francisco Business and Taxation Code, Article 1 §§ 8, 10 - Method of Appeal to the Board of Appeals, "Record Forwarded.")
The Board directed Mr. de St. Phalle to return with these plans. On or about August
22, 2017, de St. Phalle submitted the requested plans to the Board of Appeals.
At the continuance of September 13, 2017, the following parties presented before the Board of Appeals: Scott Sanchez, Planning Department; Joseph Duffy, D.B.I., Eustache and Dudley de St. Phalle, appellants; Marc Bruno, a resident neighbor; Paul Lau, a resident neighbor; Kathleen Dooley, a resident neighbor; Brent McDonald, a resident neighbor and architect; Albert Yee, former owner of 20 Nobles Alley.
The four neighbors and former owner who appeared on September 13 testified in support of the Planning Department's disapproval of the garage/s. When questioned by the Board about the project, Zoning Administrator Scott Sanchez re-confirmed the Planning Department's disapproval:

"When the building with the garage doors was researched, 20 Nobles, there were no
permits in the 1990s to do that. A garage existed-- magically appearing, it seems-- on a drawing in 1999 for an unrelated project. But there never was a permit that added one or more garage to the subject property, and that's where we are today. That we

4

17

Marc Bruno to San Francisco Ethics Commission
September 29, 2017
maintain that the garages are not legally existing. Neither one was ever legally existing on the property, and under the planning code today they cannot add one at this point. I think that's all I have to say.
In addition to the in-person testimony at the hearing September 13, 2017, the Board received 16 letters of opposition and not one letter in favor of the project. Other than the permit-holders (the de St. Phalles) nobody testified in favor of the project. Mr. Patrick Buscovich did not present at the continuance hearing on September 13, although he was in the room and consulted with the de St. Phalles.
During the deliberations prior to the vote, Board Member Swig took the lead in announcing that he was in favor of the project and wanted to give the de St. Phalle's- who had just been told their time was up by the Board President, Darryl Honda-- more time to address the Board. At Mr. Swig's urging, the Board allowed the de St. Phalle's to re-address some of the issues raised at the hearing on September 13th
Many of these same issues were raised and addressed at the hearing on July 12.
After additional deliberations led by Mr. Swig, the Board moved to approve the project, a vote was taken and the final ballot was 4 in favor and one opposed. The
sole opposing vote was by Board Member Ann Lazarus.
A copy of the Board's "Notice of Decision" on Appeal 17-088 is attached.

IU. Discussion

"Section 3.214 of the Campaign and Governmental Conduct Code requires City officers and employees to disclose on the public record any personal, professional, business relationship with any individual who is the subject of, or has an H or
ownership or financial interest in, the subject of a governmental decision being made by the officer or employee. This disclosure requirement applies only if, as a result of the relationship, the public could reasonably question the ability of the officer or employee to act for the benefit of the public. Disclosure on the public record means inclusion in the minutes of a public meeting, or if the decision is not made at a public meeting, recorded in a memorandum kept on file at the offices of M
the City officer or employee's department, board, or commission." Good Government Guide, An Overview of the Laws Governing the Conduct of Public Officials (September 3, 2014 update)
Mr. Swig's failure to disclose and recuse himself in this matter concerning Eustache
de St. Phalle is a violation of Section 3.214 of the San Francisco Campaign and
Governmental Conduct Code.

Mr. Swig also has a business relationship with Patrick Buscovich & Associates and
was thereby required to disclose that relationship in the Minutes of the Board of Appeals-- something he never did-- and, recuse himself from voting on any matter that might benefit Mr. Buscovich, something Mr. Swig never did.

Marc Bruno to San Francisco Ethics Commission

Mr. Swig's failure to disclose and recuse himself in this matter, as it might benefit Patrick Buscovich, is also a violation of Section 3.214. It should be noted that Mr. Buscovich, the principle partner in this firm, is also member of the San Francisco Board of Examiners.
By failing to disclose and recuse himself, Board Member Swig denied Complainant and other members of the public their constitutional right to have their testimony weighed and considered unimpeded by prejudice and subterfuge. The deprivation of this constitutional right is a violation of the 14th Amendment and 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the "Deprivation of Rights and Immunities Clause" of the U.S. Code.
In addition to violating Section 3.214 of the San Francisco Campaign and Governmental Conduct Code on at least two occasions, Mr. Swig's failure to disclose is also a violation of the Statement of Incompatible Activities for the San Francisco
Board of Appeals, discussed below at Section IX.
Both meetings of the Board of Appeals were held in the City-and County of San Francisco, in San Francisco City Hall, Room 416.

IX. Activities by Mr. Swig are also in conflict with the Board of Appeals Statement of Incompatible Activities
By not disclosing his business relationships with de St. Phalle and Buscovich, Board Member Swig also has violated Section III. A. (3.)(b.) of the Board of Appeals Statement of Incompatible Activities, because as a landlord to de St. Phalle and Buscovich, Swig "provides services in exchange for compensation."
"(3.)(b.) No officer or employee may be employed by, or provide services in exchange for compensation or anything of value from an individual or entity that presently has an application or matter under review before the Department or has had an application or matter under review before the Department in the preceding 12 months. This prohibition does not apply to employment of or compensation received by an officer's or employee's spouse or registered domestic partner." [III. Restrictions on Incompatible Activities; A. Restrictions that Apply to all Officers and Employees; (3.)-Activities that are Subject to Review by the Department; (b.), at San Francisco Board of Appeals Statement of Incompatible Activities, p. 3]

Advanced Written Determination, a Method to Avoid Possible Conflicts
Mr. Swig is forewarned in the Statement of Incompatible Activities that he and his fellow Board members are encouraged to seek advice from provided counsel at the Ethics Commission and other City agencies and departments should he even suspect that his actions on the Board of Appeals might result in a conflict of interest. a
Common sense and a commitment to fair play dictate that anyone on the Board of Appeals, a quasi-judicial body, would go the extra mile to adhere to the City's Ethics Code, and the Statement of Incompatible Activities invites Board Members to do just that. Five sources of advice or determination are expressly offered and encouraged

i by the Statement, and examples are given on how a Board Member ("officer" in the Statement) might ask for such written advice from:
(1) the Department, by which is meant the Board of Appeals staff; (2) the San Francisco Ethics Commission;
(3) the San Francisco City Attorney; (4) the San Francisco District Attorney; (5) Any combination thereof.

The Statement of Incompatible Activities is specifically written with Board Members in mind, and I believe that "proposed activities" includes the activities of Voting as a Board Member and Participating in deliberations as a Board Member, to wit:
"C. ADVANCE WRITTEN DETERMINATION

7

12

Marc Bruno to San Francisco Ethics Commission
September 29, 2017
.As set forth below, an employee of the Department or the director or a member of the Board of Appeals may seek an advance written determination whether a
proposed outside activity conflicts with the mission of the Department, imposes
excessive time demands, is subject to review by the Department, or is otherwise incompatible and therefore prohibited by section III of this Statement. For the purposes of this section, an employee or other person seeking an advance written determination shall be called "the requestor"; the individual or entity that provides
an advance written determination shall be called "the decision-maker."

1. PURPOSE

This subsection permits an officer or employee to seek an advance written
determination regarding his or her obligations under subsections A or B of this section. A written determination by the decision-maker that an activity is not
incompatible under subsection A or B provides the requestor immunity from any subsequent enforcement action for a violation of this Statement if the material facts are as presented in the requestor's written submission. A written determination
cannot exempt the requestor from any applicable law.
If an individual has not requested an advance written determination under
subsection C as to whether an activity is incompatible with this Statement, and the individual engages in that activity, the individual will not be immune from any
subsequent enforcement action brought pursuant to this Statement.
Similarly, if an individual has requested an advance written determination under
subsection C as to whether an activity is incompatible with this Statement, and the individual engages in that activity, the individual will not be immune from any subsequent enforcement action brought pursuant to this Statement if:
(a) the requestor is an employee who has not received a determination under subsection C from the decision-maker, and 20 working days have not yet elapsed
since the request was made; or
(b) the requestor is an officer who has not received a determination under subsection C from the decision-maker; or
(c) the requestor has received a determination under subsection C that an activity is
incompatible.

In addition to the advance written determination process set forth below, the San Francisco Charter also permits any person to seek a written opinion from the Ethics Commission with respect to that person's duties under provisions of the Charter or any City ordinance relating to conflicts of interest and governmental ethics. Any
person who acts in good faith on an opinion issued by the Commission and
concurred in by the City Attorney and District Attorney is immune from criminal or civil penalties for so acting, provided that the material facts are as stated in the

Conclusion

Ownership and tenancies of the above-referenced properties at 220 Montgomery
and 235 Montgomery, as well as the payment of rents by the de St. Phalle Law Firm to Mr. Swig for its tenancy at 220 Montgomery, as well as the professional services
provided by Mr. Patrick Buscovich at 235 Montgomery, where Mr. Buscovich has
been a tenant since 1998, prove that Board Member Swig has had and still has a business relationship with these two parties, each of whom appeared on behalf of Appeal 17-088 before the Board of Appeals July 12, 2017 and September 13, 2017.

II Neighbors Letters in Opposition, 20 Nobles Alley

ASO Son WoI NORTH BEACH

November 13th, 2017

Dear President Breed,

The NBBA would like to add their support of the appeal of a categorical exemption of a new garage at 20 Nobles Alley until there is further review of the project by the Planning Department.
We would like to point that there are safety and transportation issues - all of them impacted by the addition of a garage in such a narrow alley. Over the years, our merchants have observed the constant congestion on the 1500 block of Grant Avenue where it intersects Nobles Alley. As the location where vehicles regularly double-park, forcing pedestrians out onto the roadway, the idea of adding yet more congestion and use to this tiny alley is
unacceptable and dangerous.
For these reasons, we believe that 20 Nobles deserves further scrutiny and that the appeal should be granted.
Warmest Regards,
Signed electronically by Fady Zoubi

4.+.

Dear President Breed and Members of the Board of Supervisors:
The Russian Hill Community Association strongly urges you to support the appeal of the Categorical Exemption
for 20 Nobles Alley.
The citizens of San Francisco are mis-served by the Planning process when despite the fact that the project sponsors are cited by the City for illegal use of their property for short term rentals and the words "unpermitted", "illegal" and "no record of permit" appear in the serial permits on file ... the project sponsor is still "rewarded" is
with a Categorical Exemption.
The Planning process is failing the citizens of San Francisco when reference is made to the prior history to of garages on site without noting, as Enforcement Planner Chaska Berger states in her notes regarding 2016- 010100ENF opened on August 3, 2016, that "…two garages [were] built in late 1990's w/o permits…owner now attempts under P.A. #201607253205 to remedy unpermitted garage, this Alley is 11'wide and cannot
accommodate a garage." [emphasis provided].
The process of legalizing work done without a permit or beyond the scope of work permitted is becoming endemic in the City. Paying a penalty is small price for many project sponsors to pay when the illegal action
can be easily legalized resulting in increased profits.
This case epitomizes many of the flaws in the Planning process that citizens and their neighborhood organizations are identifying. The fact that the Board of Appeals overturned the original Planning Department denial of this Categorical Exemption is a reality. But that does not make that decision correct and cries out for
the Board of Supervisors to provide remedy.
We urge you to overturn the Categorical Exemption and support the appeal for 20 Nobles Alley.
Thank you for your consideration.

Dear Supervisors -

Chinatown Community Development Center urges you to overturn the Categorical Exemption granted to the 20 Nobles Alley by supporting the appeal in front of you. In the alternative, we urge you to vote for a continuance until after the Board of Appeals can re-hear this matter.
In 2010, Chinatown CDC worked with Supervisor David Chiu to enact Planning Code section 249.9. PC 249.9 prohibits any property owner in the North Beach/Russian Hill/Polk Gulch area who has filed an Ellis Act from adding garage. The underlying purpose was to disincentivize real estate speculation by taking away another tool to increase the value of their unit, after the speculator acted badly. At that time, a significant percentage of Ellis Act's in the
District were followed by garage additions.
The project sponsor at 20 Nobies Alley is now trying to violate the spirit of PC 249.9. First and foremost, the project sponsor has violated the City's short term rental rules, as determined by the Office of Short Term Rental. Second, the underlying garages at issue here were installed illegally -- there were no permits issued at the time of installation. The City should not provide the project sponsor the privilege of legalization after these bad acts.
If the Categorical Exemption before you is granted, the project sponsor will be able to move forward with the legalization of their surreptitiously installed garages that never received : City review until August of last year. On the other hand, if you grant the appeal, thereby denying the CE or grant a continuance of this matter, this will allow the Board of Appeals to reconsider their decision legalizing these garages. As we understand it, one of the BOA members who a voted has a business relationship with the project sponsor, thereby creating a conflict and
necessitating a re-vote.

Bottom line. Real estate speculators who game the system for personal profit at the expense of
the City should not be rewarded.
will be out of the Country from November 12 to November 18. If you have questions about
our position, please contact Roy Chan at rchan@chinatowncdc.org or 415-984-1477.

Re: 20 Nobles Alley

Dear Supervisors:

On behalf of the Community Tenants Association, I urge you to overturn the Categorical Exemption granted to 20 Nobles Alley by supporting the appeal and voting for a continuance so
that the Board of Appeals can revisit this matter.
In support of San Francisco tenants' rights which we have been doing for 30 years, we want to- call out real estate speculators who behave badly to increase the value of their units. The project sponsor at 20 Nobles Alley is trying to violate the spirit of Planning Code section 249.49. This code was enacted in 2010 to prohibit any property owner in the North Beach/Russian Hill/Polk Gulch area who has filed an Ellis Act from adding a garage. We have witnessed a pattern in the area where Ellis Acts in the District were followed by garage additions.
Adding private garages detracts from the urban fabric and compromises pedestrian safety in the dense neighborhoods that many seniors and families live. From our understanding, the owner installed the garages in question illegally with no permits issued at the time. The owner should not be rewarded for doing this. Please grant the appeal and deny the Categorical Exemption. This will allow the Board of Appeals to reconsider their decision rather than legalizing these garages. Real estate speculators who act irresponsibly for personal profit at the expense of the City and San Francisco tenants should not be rewarded.

Dear Sir Madam:
have owned a shop next door to the intersection of Nobles and Grant for 23 years. As a retailer, resident, and, above all, a person who loves this City, passionately support Planning Department's decision to disapprove the placement of a new garage at 20 Nobles Alley.
1 understand people want garages for their cars. The problem is, this is not an automatic right when you live in a City. And Nobles is not the right place to have a new garage. The garages that are there now at 20 Nobles Alley have proven unsafe. That's the reason they never were used.
The owners of the property-- they bought it only one year ago, in August, 2016-- have been cited for Short Term Rental Violations. How can an intelligent property owner (or, just responsible one) not know that San Francisco is for very good reason sensitive to illegal short term rentals?
Many people have lost their apartments because of those rentals, and I find it remarkable that the City's Board of Appeals would ever go out of its way to allow such people to avoid planning rules in order to help themselves to a
garage. Actions such as these, were you to allow a garage at 20 Nobles, lead common people to believe the city's review boards are favorable to some
people and not others.

Given the new owners blatantly avoided registering their short term rentals for three months, and given they advertised 20 Nobles as a short rental for the whole year, it is impossible to believe they ever intended to really live
here.

William Haskell to San Francisco Board of Appeals
September 4, 2017

My business, Aria, has been at 1522 Grant for over two decades. 1 regularly use a storage unit and door just 60 feet away, on Nobles Alley. It is two doors down from 20 Nobles, and on the same side of the street. I am there everyday using that door, and think 1 would have noticed the new so-called neighbors if hey had ever really lived here.
Please consider what you are doing before you allow one more non-neighbor land investor to pull the wool over the eyes of the city's guardians. know you are doing your best to determine what is fair, but please remember that others, the ones who wrote the planning code, also consider what is fair before making their policies. To allow the owners at 20 Nobles to circumvent that policy for the sake of a garage in is just plain wrong.

<eiliesh.tuffy@sfgov.org>

September 3, 2017

Dear Appeals Board Member:
I write as a longtime resident of North Beach and as a native San Franciscan who grew up primarily in this neighborhood. This is an area of the city dear to me, both because I am a resident and because of the unique contribution the neighborhood's buildings and people have made to San Francisco.
As a property owner in the neighborhood, I am sympathetic to the need for parking. Nevertheless, I strongly support the Planning Department decision to deny the installation of a new garage at 20 Nobles. The reason is simple: Without a Planning Code and without a common commitment to it, the city will become every man and woman for themselves, and the loving City by the Bay will become one more metropolitan dystopía.
It seems to me our planning code consists of three elements: public policy, safety considerations and history, On all three grounds, I do not think it proper to allow a garage at 20 Nobles.
On historical grounds, and after considerable use of public resources, the Planning and Building Departments, along with the Bureau of Street Use and Mapping, determined the garages currently at 20 Nobles are not legal. There is no evidence of an application, a job card or a permit for a garage.

With regard to safety, alleyways with garages make it difficult to use the
sidewalks. I am a pedestrian and public transit user. If and when we allow private parties to install garages in alleys, the permit history should be free of the legal issues we find at 20 Nobles. To repeat what was stated by Planning, "the creation of a ground floor garage was not part of the approved project scope for that permit or any other permit on file with the Department of Building Inspection."

Lastly, our planning code is a reflection of public policy. I am a property manager, a property owner and a long-time volunteer at a program for those who have no property at all the homeless. Although the issue at 20 Nobles seems to be only about a garage, it also concerns the homeless.
The Property Informatlon Map for 20 Nobles, Block 0104 / Lot 025, indicates that the very people asking for an exception to be made in the planning code SO that they may build a new garage were cited in March of this year for using the building illegally and without registration for short-term rentals. They were advertising the property not merely for the two months when people rented, but until nearly the end of the year. The only thing that stopped them, it seems, ts that their plans were uncovered by the City.
Almost none of the people where I volunteer were born homeless. They were™ forced onto the street because of family dysfunction, health breakdowns, loss of employment and/or (and most directly) by simply getting evicted, It is well known that many of these evictions result from short-term rentals-- people misusing commercial buildings as hotels, just like the property owners at 20 Nobles. I know this site would be only one more, small, illegal hotel. But the cumulative effect of all these illegal usages is devastating for the poor. This is the reason I ask you to support the findings of the Planning Department and not allow the owners to avoid the rules of the Planning Code one more time.
Please do not hesitate to phone if I can be of further assistance to you,

Garage at 20 Nobles Alley, SF APPEAL # 13-085

My name is Louis Biro and I am a freelance artist, independent
contractor and 29 year North Beach resident, who has lived a
block away from the proposed garage at 20 Nobles Alley. I work and shop in the neighborhood, and walk past these
garages almost every day.

I am against the new garage proposal because my
understanding from the City's Notice of Denial is that the
current garages are illegal, and any new garage proposal there would contradict a law passed by the Board of Supervisors
protecting small alleys from garages.

Given that the existing garages were built illegally, I do not
believe that the current owners should be allowed to build a
new garage now, because that would reward the property for
breaking the law in the first place.

These issues were known at the time of purchase, and it would
be unfair and contradictory.

I also feel that the placement of any new garage would
a have a negative impact on the rest of us that live in the district.
This is a pedestrian section of the neighborhood and there are
no other working garages in this area.

I am not against the new owners wanting to increase the value
of their property,

1

4.

If there were any new construction to be done on this site, I would like to see them obtain legal permits, if possible, and
create an additional unit for more housing in the area.

As a long term resident I have watched the decrease of curb and sidewalk space over the years as many legal construction projects have occurred. I don't believe that one more, albeit illegal, project improves the neighborhood in any way.

Statement of Albert Yee. August 2,2017 APPEAL # 17-088 Tom0 O AMOWAPN (MCNESA

My name is Albert Yee. appéared here two weeks ago to address a proposed garage at 20 Nobles. I am here today to clarify my position and give you several documents you do not
have.

The Yee family owned 20 Nobles for almost 40 years. My parents purchased it in 1958, and, following the death of my
parents, my brothers and I sold the property in June, 1997;
During the entire time we owned the property, we never installed a garage. On the contrary, we made almost no additions to the property except to envelope the original
wooden structure in stucco.

lived at 20 Nobles until I left for college. I attended University of California at Berkeley, and I received a degree in engineering. From then until my retirement. I worked in the
United States as Senior Principal Engineer for a consulting
engineering company.

Based on my experience as an engineer, and based on my experience at 20 Nobles, can tell you that no garage should
have been placed there without proper permits. To do so without specs, without drawings, without any calculations for soft story framing is an indication that someone made a major structural change outside the parameters of the law,
feel it is unfair to suggest the garages were ever there when my family sold the house, as if we placed them there illegally. We didn't.

4'

Here is a photo of the house when we sold it. Here is a photo of the house when we bought it 40 years earlier. The earlier photo is from the Recorder-Assessor's Office.
You can see that the apertures at the front of the house are identical. You also can see that except for the stucco envelope, the house is historically preserved. When my family added the stucco envelope, we did it properly We got a permit.

do not believe the new owners-- who, I'm told, were informed
by the City about this problem before they bought the house - should be allowed to place a new garage there, based on the illegally built garages. This would only invite more people to . circumvent the planning and building codes all of us are asked to obey as property owners.

Thank you for your time, and thank you for allowing me to clarify the permitting history at 20 Nobles Alley.

Disapproval"

Dear Commissioners, Directors and Planning Staff;
As a nearby neighbor and architect, I support the determination of the San Francisco Planning Department and its "Notice of Planning Department Disapproval"---regarding an illegal garage opening on a narrow street under 41 feet in width--- within a designated historic district.
As a narrow dead-end alley with multiple residential entryways, Nobles Alley has unique constraints and potential liabilities. Cars may need to back up or back down the street---into Grant Avenue's busy pedestrian and traffic routes. With extremely tight turning radiuses, a garage would require multiple maneuvers that could
easily hit adjacent buildings and infringe over pedestrian sidewalks.
Parenthetically, this property apparently has been used as a part-time rental, possibly illegally. Especially if visiting tourists use such a garage, the odds of an accident would increase---given their unfamiliarity with San Francisco's hilly terrain and narrow dead-end streets.

Regards, Howard Wong, AIA

Besides the points made in the Disapproval Notice I also may note that the entire resident was il- legally used for short term rentals from January through March of this year.

I write you to support the Planning Department decision to deny the installation of a new garage at 20 Nobles for three reasons. First, it is in clear violation of the city codes concerning this kind of construction which are well conceived based upon safety concern in accessing alleys by emergency vehicles which this kind of (de)construction will clearly obstruct. Secondly, construction vehicles will take parking on Grant Ave. for months to both remove debris and bring construction material up the alley to the worksite. These parking spaces will be taken on the street where my business operates further exacerbating the colossal parking problems in North Beach and hindering customer access to our small business commercial district and my business in particular.
Lastly, For over a decade and a half, North Beach has been the target of massive (de)construction projects both private and public, streetscape and inside privately owned buildings. WENEED A
BREAK!
Please oppose this project and ALL further projects of this kind which violate zoning ordinances, are disruptive to both neighbors and our commercial district.
Thank You,
Daniel Macchiarini

I was living for ten years with Roger Strobel, a native of N. Beach, at 121 Varennes, and used the basement back-exit that opens on Nobles Alley, as often as not. Very pleasant, having a quiet dead-end space at one's toetips, like a little slice of Morocco, or the old city in Sevilla.

Dear Ms. Goldstein and Fellow Board Members:

My name is Gloria Zelman, and I was a tenant at 23 Nobles
directly across the street from 20 Nobles from 1991 until July, 2009. During that time, two garages were built at 20
Nobles.

I do not recall exactly what year the garages were built. However, I would like to share with you this: During the 10 or 11 years I lived there after the garages were installed,
neither one of them was ever used.

My work took me downtown every day. I would be gone
from 12:00 Noon to 6:00 or 7:00 daily-- including,
sometimes on Saturday. It seems to me that if those garages were being used by someone, I would have noticed this on at least one or two occasions. In fact, I never saw a
single car pull in or out of either of those garages.

It seemed to me at the time that the two garages might
have been installed as a consequence of poor planning.

As a longtime resident of North Beach -- I lived in the neighborhood for a total of 29 years-- I can attest to the fact that a garage (or garages) such as the ones placed at 20

Nobles are by nature unsafe. They would be a safety
hazard.

Anyone living at 21, 23 or 25 Nobles (I was then living in Apartment 23, the middle floor of the three-story building) would be endangered entering or exiting the building. A car attempting to park in the garages at 20 Nobles would have
to maneuver back and forth across the narrow sidewalk,
blocking the entrance to the building.
Had I been given a chance to comment on the construction back in the late '90s, I am sure that I would have pointed
out these unsafe conditions to City Planning. Later, there
was no need to complain about the garages at 20 Nobles
because they were simply not being used.

Sincerely,

Gloria Zelman

2016.08.09.04528

Dear Ms Goldstein and Members of the Board,

As a long-time resident of North Beach, since 1978, I have been able to experlence all the drastic changes that have occurred in the neighborhood. Based on these experiences, I am strongly opposed to the imposition of a new garage at
20 Nobles Alley.

In fact, It is my understanding that the garages there now, were built Illegally, which is one good reason not to allow
another in the same location.

I belleve that North Beach and unique character of our neighborhood is worth preserving. While on the one hand, it probably doesn't seem likely that a garage or two would detroy all that. The very oppositite is the case. Let me tell you
why.

Many people who have lived in our neighborhood for decades have been forced to give up their most treasured apartments because of short term rentals. Developers and investors are buying up our neighborhood not to live here, but to make windfalls of money on the units they buy. And this seems to be obviously what is happening at 20 Nobles, because the owners are never here and have already gotten in trouble with the city for illegal short term rentals.
Why should such dishonest owners that have no respect for the law or our neighbors in this area be rewarded by the
City with new garage?
The answer is, they shouldn't be.

Most important of all, I was living here In 1997 and 1998, the years that the two illegal garages were probably built. Had I been given a chance to protest these garage then- instead of having it done behind the scenes, where nobody could comment or criticize--l most definitely would have shown up and said, "This is not good for the neighborhood."
Every single aparment right now is so very very precious and so is each one of my precious neighbors. It would be wonderful If the people at 20 Nobles would create d new apartment instead of a new garage.

Thank you so very very much for your time,
Sincerely,
Linda Federowicz

RE: San Francisco's Upper Grant Avenue, Appeal No. 17-088

Dear Commissioners:

I raise two points concerning the above referenced appeal, both of which strongly support the decision by the San Francisco Planning Department to properly disapprove the construction of a new garage at
20 Nobles Alley.
First, by stipulation 1 include my comments made at the Board Hearing of July 12, 2017 on this matter. You might recall that one of my primary concerns at that time was that the garages now existing at 20 Nobles seem never to have been permitted.
Nothing I have leaned since then about this project convinces me otherwise. Indeed, the testimony at that hearing, which I now have had a chance to review, confirms that Planning and Building representatives familiar with the extensive research done on this permit history came to the same conclusion: the garages at 20 Nobles were never legal.
The practical effect of this is that the garages are likely to be structurally unsound, and included neither neighborhood participation nor City oversight in their design and construction.
This aspect of the permit also should be considered by the Board. If everything we did as architects, engineers and review boards was confined to paper, and never improved the daily lives of people in the real world, we would not be doing our jobs properly.
In the 20 years since the garages were built, not one of three owners who owned the building have ever applied for a curb cut, unsurprising,

3:

as the owners themselves must have realized that the garages were
unpermitted do to obvious tell-tale signs such as this.
Secondly, I would like to raise a fairness and process issue. It seems to me that if the Board of Appeals and the Planning Department relies on the eyes and ears of the neighborhood to call attention to such permit problems, as exist at 20 Nobles, then, City agencies should be forthcoming with record requests by interested neighbors.
In regards to 20 Nobles Alley, neighbors asked time and again for the plans attached to the current proposal, Permit 201608094528. They
never were given plans until two days ago-- and these plans do not correspond to the permit submittal in question, they are a revision in
response to issues since raised.
The permit is dated August 9, 2016; the plans are dated over one year later. Secondly, the permit describes the movement of a door to the center of the building, the plans do not. Third, the City's Permit Tracking records shows plans being submitted by the permit-holders on this project September 21, 2016; a revision being submitted to Planning on January 13, 2017 and a second revision (also given to Planning) on
February 6, 2017. The plans recently provided to the nieghborhoos are
dated 8/21/17

It is these plans, not the latest rendition, that were at issue at the hearing before the Board of Appeals on July 12. They have yet to be submitted to
public scrutiny.

In this respect, the property owners today seem to me to be no more forthcoming than those in the 1990s who built the illegal garages in the first place. To change plans a fourth or fifth time outside of public view once again removes those most directly affected from the design process. I believe this is a serious error, unfair and inconsistent with our City's Building and Planning Codes.

Subject: Support for planning dept. disapproval of garages at 20 Nobles Alley (appeal # 17-088)

Dear Appeals Board Member:
My wife and I are long time North Beach residents. I lived at 15 Nobles Alley for many years before we were married. We are sympathetic for the need for parking in North Beach however we support the planning department decision to deny a new garage at 20 Nobles Alley.
This is particularly narrow and confined alleyway with heavy pedestrian and vehicular traffic. To add a garage and the ensuing traffic that would result seems insane and particularly dangerous to pedestrians.
We understand also that the garage in question is not legal, There is no evidence of an application or a permit. for a garage. It is also indicated that the people asking for an exception to be made in the planning code in order to build a new garage were cited in March 2017 for using the building illegally and without registration for short term rentals.

North Beach is special to us and we are protectivo of the area. We genuinely feel that an additional garage would diminish the safety and quality of life in this neighborhood for residents and visitors.

Re: Support of Planning Disapproval of Garages, 20 Nobles; Appeal # 17-
088.

Dear Board Members and Commissioners:

For several years in the 1970s, my grandmother, Dorothy Erskine, promoted an idea with residents, businesses and staff at the Planning Department that Grant Avenue in North Beach would thrive as a full or
part-time pedestrian walkway. The idea simply was to close off four blocks of Grant to vehicular traffic, from Grant at Columbus on the south
to Grant at Filbert Street on the north.

remain convinced that Dorothy's vision is a viable alternative to the street we find today. If you look at our parks throughout the City-- and if you speak with senior members of S.P.UR.-- you will discover that Ms. Erskine was extremely prescient when it came to making the city inviting to everyone. She worked for over 50 years for a livable, sustainable and walkable City. A walkway on Grant, (from Columbus to Filbert, with no garages) would revitalize the merchant community, make the public right-of-way more family friendly and set an example to the world of our City's commitment to greening the urban environment.
Today, in our "zero garage environment" from Grant at Columbus to
Grant at Filbert, Nobles Alley runs off the 1500 block of Grant. A garage
there would make such a walkway impossible or greatly truncated. I
hope the City will consider this when reviewing the possibility of a new
garage at 20 Nobles Alley.
•I

Given our city's strong commitment to car share, bicycles and Transit
First- new garages are less necessary than ever, including one on
Nobles Alley.
Thank you for your thoughtful consideration of this matter; please include the within email as part of the official record for your meeting on
9/13/17v

09 - 06 - 17

Dear Commissioners,
It was suggested at the hearing on this matter on July.12, 2017 that the Planning Department had already decided, or was about to decide, that the building and building site where the proposed garage would be placed has no historic value.
While I agree with the Department's Notice of Disapproval for the project, I disagree with what the Planning Department seems ready to conclude about the building's lack of historical value.
In subsequent discussions by phone with Ms. Eiliësh Tuffy, the plauner on this project, I learned that the Department relies primarily on the 1982 North Beach Survey to come to the conclusion that 20 Nobles is a "non-contributor."

As I point out in one section of my comments on that 1982 Survey,
"The Survey's authors themselves tell us directly how they intended their work to be used. Nothing in their statement of purpose mentions or even hints at the Survey being used to determine which buildings are worth saving and which not. Here is a complete copy of that brief Statement:

Statement of Purpose The Survey was originally suggested in 1980 by Ms. Margret Price on behalf of a proposed group called North Beach Merchants and Professionals. The concern was that "North Beach" was disappearing from City maps; that this area of the City, with it's "wonderful urban fabric" (architectural historian Randolph Delehanty) had never been examined and documented; and the contributions of Italian-Americans should be acknowledged through examination of their traditional geographic location. The purpose was furthermore to define the area known as North Beach, as opposed to Russian or Telegraph Hills. A non-profit California corporation, separate

from the Merchants, was organized to administer the grant funds and direct the survey. The survey period was January 1,1981 through June 30, 1982.
The complete Draft Comments on the Survey, and I apologize for not having a more finished version
prepared for this Board package.
In addition, I would like to respond to the applicant / Permit Holder's remarks at the hearings about my personal motives for.objecting to a garage at 20 Nobles Alley.
I am a preservationist. work closely with others who are like-minded in the neighborhood-- and many who are aren't. The article I wrote for the San Francisco Chronicle (2003, attached) resulted in the referenced property being purchased by the City and turned into a library-- the location of the City's newest, the North Beach Library,

I also was commented upon by the applicant / permit-holder at the hearing on July 12 that I was somehow involved in her and her husband being cited by the City for violating the short-term rental
code. I had nothing to do with reporting that, and I did not even know it was happening.
An attached letter from Omar Masry, the lead attorney for the Short Term Rental Enforcement confirms my un-involvement with this matter.
In conclusion, think it important that whomever buys a building in our increasingly attractive and desired City plays by the rules. That is all this matter is about. Without the rules, including the Planning Code, the City will cease to function in a way that is forward-looking, benevolent and just.
Sincerely,

Marc Bruno

Problems with North Beach Survey
marc bruno 09.07.17 DRAFT COMMENTS
Of the eight separate addresses in Nobles Alley, each and every Chinese-owned property surveyed in 1982 is unlisted. Of those Chinese-owned buildings two of them, 6 - 8 Nobles and 18 - 20 Nobles, clearly fall within the parameters of
"contributory" set forth by the Survey's authors.
More problematic still, one of the listed "contributory" buildings, 21 - 23- 25
Nobles, clearly falls outside the parameters set forth by the Survey's authors.
Here is a screen shot of the listings in the 1982 Survey:

2

interviewers who did all the house-by-house ground-work for the survey shied away from Chinese-owned buildings because of language difficulties. Equally likely is that Chinese owners were resistant to their buildings being given a "special status" a
and choose not to participate.
In regards to the possibility of cultural bias, it is interesting to note that of the 16 participating researchers in the 1982 Survey, only one has a Chinese surname. Of the seven field workers (students) who actually walked the streets and determined which buildings should be included, none have a Chinese surname
Here is an example of two other buildings in Nobles Alley that illustrates the • deficiencies of the North Beach Survey:
(1) 6 - 8 Nobles on the north side of the alley is a building owned by Chinese owners and not listed in the Survey. This building remains one of the best preserved and least altered buildings in the alley, if not in the entire historic district. The oddly narrow garage door was used as a storage unit, and that door plus all the
apertures on the facade are still there today.
A 1958 photo from the Assessor's Office, from the Recorder Assessor Office indicates that the building had not undergone any post- earthquake changes.
(2) 21 - 23-25 Nobles on the south side of the street is not even an independent property, nor was it at the time of the Survey in 1982. As indicated on a 1949 Sanborn Map, and confirmed by current property records; the correct address for the building is 460 - 462 Union Street. This address is not listed in the North Beach Survey. The addition of a modern garage and an overhanging bay window on the Union Street side of the building show that drastic revisions were made to the
building in the 1950 and '60s.
The Planning Code neither encourages nor allows categorization of buildings as historically significant based on an in-law unit. Why was 21 - 23 - 25 included in
the Survey at all?
There is an additional problem with the inclusion of 21 - 23 - 25 Nobles. The window treatments at 21 - 23 - 25 Nobles, the backside of 460 - 462 Union, are uninterrupted casements far larger in width than anything in the entire historic district. It is simply not the way windows were made at the time of the building's
construction in 1908.

A complete listing of the eight addresses in Nobles Alley, with the Survey's designation of "contributory," as noted:
North side of alley:
Nobles # 2, contributory (a non-Chinese owner) and should be so listed; Nobles # 6 - 8 is non-contributory (a Chinese owner) and should be listed (see notes on this building below); Nobles# 12 - 16 is non-contributory (a non-Chinese owner) and should not be listed; Nobles # 18 - 20 is non-contributory (a Chinese owner) and should be listed (see notes
on this building below).
South side of alley: Nobles # 21 - 23 - 25 is listed (a non-Chinese owner) and should not be listed (see notes
on this building below); Nobles # 15 is listed (non-Chinese) and I do not yet know enough about the circumstance of this listing to determine whether or not it is properly listed;
Nobles # 7 - 9 is non-contributory (a non-Chinese owner) and I do not yet know enough about the circumstance of this listing to determine whether or not it is properly listed; Nobles # 5 is non-contributory (a non-Chinese owner) and I do not yet know enough about the circumstance of this listing to determine whether or not it is properly listed.
(It is important to note that Survey authors never designated a building "non- contributory," and this might be part of the reason that certain buildings in Nobles were overlooked. Once student-surveyors decided that a building evinced major changes, or was somehow inaccessible, none of the Survey's three "lead authors" re-
examined the building.)
Of the eight buildings listed in the 1982 Survey, three markedly contradict the criteria set forth by the authors themselves, and two others are questionable. One of three that openly contradict the criteria of what makes something "contributory" is
20 Nobles.

20 Nobles should have been included as a contributory building in the 1982 Survey,
but wasn't.

The reason for this is unknown. It is possible cultural bias directed the student

3

Presuming Survey researchers had access to the Sanborn map and Recorder- Assessor photos we have today, is it possible that the "contributory list" was never intended to be used for purposes of deciding which buildings were worth preserving
and which not?
The Survey's authors themselves tell us directly how they intended their work to be
used. Nothing in their statement mentions or hints at preservation.

Statement of Purpose The Survey was originally suggested in 1980 by Ms. Margret Price on behalf of a proposed group called North Beach Merchants and Professionals. The concern was that "North Beach" was disappearing from City maps;
that this area of the City, with It's "wonderful urban fabric" (architectural historian Randolph Delehanty) had never been examined and documented; and the contributions of Italian-Americans should be acknowledged through examination of their traditional geographic location, The purpose was furthermore to define the area known as North Beach, as opposed to Russian or Telegraph Hills. A non-profit California corporation, separate from the Merchants, was organized to administer the grant funds and direct the survey, The survey period was January 1,1981 through June 30, 1982.
This is the entire statement of purpose of the authors of the North Beach Survey.

(3) 20 Nobles Alley
#20 Nobles Alley (Chinese owned and not included as part of the Survey) is a perfectly preserved building with unique double vertical structure on a single lot. While it is not clear why two separate buildings were built at 20 Nobles, the rear
having only a narrow passage for entry from the public right of way, it seems the original owner might have used the rear building to support his burgeoning alcohol business elsewhere in the neighborhood.
This man, "Arturo Elias," was of Greek and Spanish origin and is noted, in part, for having owned one of the most notorious bars and flop-houses in the Barbary Coast- - and for having been arrested on numerous occasions for using strong-arm tactics
to collect the rents.
In 1982, at the time of the North Beach Survey, #20 Nobles Alley was the same building built and lived in by Arturo Elias, the only difference being the addition of a stucco treatment to the building's wood facade by the "Yee Family," who purchased #20 Nobles in 1958 and sold it in 1997/ 1998.
In my conversations with Albert Yee, a member of the family who, with his elder brother, took charge of the building upon their mother's death in 1993, I was told

5

the original wood facade here at #20 Nobles was not removed or destroyed but, rather, encased in a chicken-wire-and-lathe construction upon which a plaster frontage was applied.
In every respect, the structure at 20 Nobles exceeds the requirements of "historic" designated by the City's residential design guidelines, which read, in part,
"The term historic building includes all buildings designated as City Landmarks or
located in historic districts, identified on the National Register of Historic Places, and all buildings rated in the 1976 Architectural Survey of Significant Buildings by the Department of City Planning. Alteration of an historic building therefore requires review by the City's Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board, and the application of national guidelines intended to preserve the historic character of buildings."
Residential Design Guidelines San Francisco Department of City Planning, REF
720.9794 Sä52r 1989b (November, 1989)
The application of a stucco frontage in 1958 does not under any architectural or preservationist guideline automatically disqualify a building from being considered a contributor to the historic district.
Moreover, as noted in the City's residential guidelines, the building's presence within the North Beach Telegraph Hill Historic District establishes a presumption of its historicity, the burden of which requires any applicant to remove that
presumption.
20 Nobles has no structural, historic or architectural imperfections from today looking backwards to the day of its birth, an elegant and pure edifice residing in the near-geographic center of one of the City's and, indeed, nation's most pre-eminent* Historic Districts.

Two Questions Concerning North Beach Survey
Dear Eiliesh-

6

Welcome back to the department. I understand you recently were on vacation.
Thank you for your note, re-printed below, which answers some but not all of the questions I posed regarding the failure of the North Beach Survey to include 20 Nobles as a contributory building. (One of the things you kindly did was to send me a copy of the North Beach Survey, a document written by Anne Bloomfield and others-- including students from San Francisco
State.)
The two questions I left on your machine-- in response to the conclusions you draw in the attached letter--- are these:
(1) How can the Planning Department draw conclusions about the building prior to submission of the historical documents required to be submitted by the applicant? (2) If the applicant has submitted such documents, may I view them?
Thank you for your time and your quick response-- though only partial-- to my prior request.
Yours,

Dear Marc, Attached please find a .pdf file (27MB) of the 1982 North Beach Survey, which Anne Bloomfield participated in as lead researcher.
While district boundaries were identified for the Upper Grant Historic District that encompass Nobles Alley, 20 Nobles Alley was not cited as a contributing historic resource. Only 3 building on Noble Alley were listed for inclusion in the district: #2, #15, and #21-25.
The reason why 20 Nobles appears in the city's Property Information Map with an Historic Resource Status of "A" is due to the presence of the historic district overlay --- to alert planners of the presence of a district. This is to ensure exterior alterations to non-contributors do not destroy the integrity of the overall district. In general, CEQA-Historical review allows for the insertion of a garage door on a non- contributing building if the immediate surrounding context supports that type of alteration, if the door is kept to the minimum dimensions required, and it is painted out to match the exterior building siding and minimize its visual prominence. Based on those criteria, a single garage door at 20 Nobles would be acceptable to Preservation strictly from CEQA-Historical standpoint.

20 Nobles Alley Summary of Appeal of Categorical Exemption, ..*

Summary of Appeal of Categorical Exemption at 20 Nobles Alley,

17 neighbors-- business owners and residents who live and work near
20 Nobles Alley-- object to and appeal the designation of the 2-building
3-unit site as "Categorically Exempt."
The effect of a Categorical Exemption at 20 Nobles is to allow an illegal garage currently located there-- a garage which, being poorly designed, has never been used-- to be legalized and modified-for-use, the first and
only such garage in Nobles Alley, the first such garage in the 1500 block
of Grant Avenue where Nobles is located, and, indeed, the first and only garage in the four blocks from Grant-at-Columbus to Grant-at-Filbert.
By adding this garage to the four block commercial corridor in the heart
of the North Beach Historic District, the proposed project represents "substantial change that may effect the environment,' a change that requires review under the California Environmental Quality Act.
"Categorical Exemption" means no review whatsoever. We ask instead for a Mitigated Negative Declaration, the only review that will give those of us who live here-- and the City at-large-- a chance to protect this
unique urban oasis, this pedestrian friendly and graceful alley.
No person or group supports this project. The only advocates are the permit-holders, whose primary residence is in Mill Valley. Just months
after purchasing 20 Nobles, they were found guilty of illegal short-term
rentals there. Their intentions are clear; in equity they would be said to
have "unclean hands," undermining the relief they now seek from the
City. Had they not been exposed, they still would be advertising on Airbnb today. To reward them with a garage subverts and undercuts City housing policy, and does so based on a misapplication of the law.
City Housing Policies subverted by Legalizing a Garage at 20 Nobles
In 2010, our City's elected officials by unanimous vote implemented Planning Code Section 249.24, prohibiting new garages in alleyways in
the North Beach Special Use District. The legislation included an express
statement of City policy, to wit:

-1

"San Francisco Planning Code Section 249.49. Purposes. To regulate off-street parking and the installation of garages in existing residential structures in order to ensure that they do not significantly increase the level of automobile traffic, increase pollution, or impair pedestrian use on narrow public rights-of-way in the District; and to prevent the ability to add parking from providing an incentive to convert residential buildings from rental buildings to tenancies-in-common."
To regulate. To decrease pollution. To protect rental units. What "narrow
public right of way" in the City is narrower than the sidewalks of Nobles Alley? You will not find them. Sidewalks traversed daily by residents who enter and exit 45 units accessible only via pedestrian-friendly Nobles Alley.
Section 249.49 is not opposed to TICs per se. Conversions mean the loss of rentals. This is the law's goal: To preserve residential rentals available to all San Franciscans, regardless of means. It is recognized that Airbnb also has a detrimental effect on rentals. The City cited the permit-holders at 20 Nobles for engaging in Airbnb rentals illegally. To allow a garage there undoes what elected officials chose to do. One more reason we oppose a Categorical Exemption and demand a more meaningful environmental review.
CEQA cannot be used to undermine local Environmental Law
CEQA does not endorse circumventing local environmental law. That is particularly true when, as here, elected officials in their legislation expressly include the reasons for their policies.
The illegal garage at 20 Nobles damages an "A" level historic resource, and, by virtue of being illegal, sets a precedent jeopardizing the Historic District. This is another reason that adding a garage at 20 Nobles would violate CEQA, because Section 15300.2 of the Guidelines provides that a "project shall not be exempt from environmental review if it may cause
a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historic resource or
where it may contribute to a cumulative impact on a historic district."
We should not give permit-holders a Get Out of Jail Card when, in their own words, they admit, "Nothing prevents us walking a few blocks to our car." (They currently rent a garage less than one block away.) There
are no public benefits to adding a garage in Nobles, and there is no
private necessity. We ask you to overturn the Categorical Exemption so that whatever is done here adheres to City housing policy, conforms to Section 249.49 and enhances the environmental balance and walk-
ability of the North Beach Historic District. Thank you.

2016.08.09.4528 (Building Permit Application Number)
Telegraph Hill-North Beach Residential SUD (Special Use District)
Building Permit Application #2016.08.09.4528 has been received by the Planning Department and assigned to planner Biliesh Tuffy. Eiliesh has completed review of the application for corrective work to address Notice of Violation #201620916. The scope of work for the project as stated on the application is: "garage door correction per NOV 201620916- seal unpermitted garage door, relocate legal garage door to center of ground floor."
Please be advised that the Planning Department has disapproved Building Permit Application No. 2016.08.09.4528. This notice is to alert the project sponsor of the process of review for the submitted application and to convey the Department's findings that, due to restrictions enacted with the adoption of the Telegraph Hill-North Beach Residential Special Use District in 2010, the Planning Department cannot approve the proposed relocation of the existing garage door at the front façade of the existing residential
structure.

CEOA - Historical Review
The North Beach neighborhood was surveyed in 1982 to identify cultural resources of significance in the area. The findings of the North Beach survey, which was adopted by the Board of Supervisors in 1999, included areas within the neighborhood that qualified for designation in the California Register of Historical Resources. The subject property at 20 Nobles Alley is located within the boundaries of the
Upper Grant Avenue Historic District, but was not found to be a contributing building to the district at
the time of the survey due to its extensive alterations. Visible alterations to "Non-Contributing" buildings are typically reviewed for their general compatibility with the surrounding district,
The Historical Review of the design proposal determined that the existing two-garage door design could not be supported because it would not conform to Sec. 144 of the Planning Code, which limits garage openings to no more than one-third of the width of the ground story along the front lot line. However, because some historic buildings in the historic district have single garage door entrances of a modest scale, the removal of the second unpermitted garage door and restoration of a prior man-door and window opening was reviewed as a means of returning the ground floor a design to a more historic appearance. This determination was predicated on the sponsor's ability to provide evidence of the single
garage door's legal installation.

Building Permit Review Building permits and plans were reviewed to determine a record of work at the property. Plans associated with permit applications (nos. 9723784 and 9723786) filed in 1997 to remove kitchens, remove interior, non-load bearing wall and combine units 20 and 20A into one unit," show a single garage opening. However, the creation of a ground floor garage was not part of the approved project scope for that permit or any other permit on file with the Department of Building Inspection. Similarly, there are no permits on file that approved the creation of a second a garage door opening at the subject property. Lacking any evidence of the legal construction of the ground floor garage doors, the proposal to "seal unpermitted garage door, relocate legal garage door to center of ground floor" was reviewed as "new"
garage installation in an existing residential structure.

Planning Code Review
The Planning Code Review determined that legalization of either a 2-door garage or a 1-door garage at the subject property would not meet the requirements of Section 144 and Section 249.49 of the Planning Code, with the latter code section preventing the installation of new garages in existing residential
structures.

Section 144(b)(1) Entrances to Off-Street Parking Except as otherwise provided herein, in the case of every dwelling in such districts no more than one- third of the width of the ground story along the front lot line, or along a street side lot line, or along a building wall that is set back from any such lot line, shall be devoted to entrances to off-street parking, except that in no event shall a lot be limited by this requirement to a single such entrance of less than ten feet in width, or to a single such entrance of less than 8 feet in RTO and RTO-M districts. In addition, no entrance to off-street parking on any lot shall be wider than 20 feet, and where two or more separate
entrances are provided there shall be a minimum separation between such entrances of six feet. Lots in RTO and RTO-M districts are limited to a total of 20 feet per block frontage devoted to entrances to off- street parking. Street-facing garage structures and garage doors may not extend closer to the street than a primary building facade unless the garage structure and garage door are consistent with the features listed in Section 136 of this Code. Entrances to off-street parking shall be located at least six feet from lot
corner located at the intersection of two public rights-of-way.

Section 144 First Appears in the Planning Code in April, 2008

Brent -

The date is found in the final line of this reprint, below, of the relevant section of the
San Francisco Planning Code. It reads: Supp. No, 16, April 2008.

This date tells us when Section 144 was first added to a printed edition of the Code,
but it does not necessarily tell us when this section was first enacted. Passage might have occurred the year before, in 2007. I will find out what the answer is when go
to the Planning Department tomorrow morning.

FYI- Below is a reprint of Section 144 from the "Internet Archive Reprint of Part I of the San Francisco Planning Code." You may find the reprint on-line here:
https://archive.org/stream/gov.ca.sf.planning.01/ca_sf_planning_01_djvu.txt

The reference to Section 1.44 in the Appeals Board file may be found in the Planning
Department's Disapproval letter, as you know. Here is a reprint of that part of the letter first referring to Section 144:

"The Historical Review of the design proposal determined that the existing two-car garage door design could not be supported because it would not conform to Sec. 144 of the San Francisco Planning Code, which limits garage openings to no more than one-third of the width of the ground story along the
front line.'

Notice of Intent to File Suit Under the California Environmental Quality Act
Regarding Board of Supervisors Motion M17-175 upholding a Categorical Exemption issued by the San Francisco Planning Department regarding
Permit Application 201608094528 and 20 Nobles Alley, San Francisco.

Dear Mayor Lee, Chairman Nolan, Clerk Calvillo, Director Rahaim, and President Wu:
I am writing on behalf of myself and "Save North Beach" regarding the San Francisco
Planning Department's decision to approve a new garage at 20 Nobles Alley (hereinafter, the "Project"). This decision conflicts with Planning Code 249.49 ("garages in the Telegraph Hill-North Beach Special Use District") and is contrary to
many of the Department's own findings in this matter.
