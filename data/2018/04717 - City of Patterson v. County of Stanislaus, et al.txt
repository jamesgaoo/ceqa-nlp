22 INTRODUCTION

23 Petitioner City of Patterson ("Patterson," "City," or "Petitioner") petitions this Court for a

24 writ of mandate, directed to Respondents County of Stanislaus ("County"), the Stanislaus County
25 Board of Supervisors ("Board"), and the Stanislaus County Airport Land Use Commission
26 (*ALUC") (collectively, "Respondents"). Petitioner challenges the Board's October 30, 2018,
27 certification of the Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the Crows Landing Industrial
28 Business Park Specific Plan ("Specific Plan"), the ALUC's November 15, 2018, approval of
(CW071131.8)
Churchwell Whiteue Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

Airport Land Use Commission Application No. PLN 2013-0091 to amend the Stanislaus County

2 Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan, and the Board's December 4, 2018, approval of the Specific

3 Plan, General Plan Amendment, and Rezone Application No. PLN2013-0091 (collectively, the

4 "Project").

5 The Project approvals are intended to facilitate development of the Crows Landing

6 Industrial Business Park, through which the County intends to develop logistics/distribution, light
industrial, business park and general aviation uses, along with associated public infrastructure, on
property owned by the County. Located along the Highway corridor, the Specific Plan proposes

9 to develop approximately 1,274 acres out of an available 1,528 acres, to create approximately

10 15,000 new jobs onsite. Through the Specific Plan, the County intends to provide sufficient site

11 infrastructure, improvements and services to enable "shovel-ready" development opportunities.

12 Amid these lofty goals, however, the Project would rely on the surrounding cities of Patterson and

13 Newman to meet Project needs for housing, sewer service, and other essential public services.

14 As a responsible agency under the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources

15 Code section 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"), Patterson has consistently voiced concerns to the County

16 regarding the Project. Unfortunately, Patterson's initial comment letter in 2014 raised several

17 salient concerns under CEQA that remain unaddressed to this day. The County must properly
18 analyze and mitigate significant, growth-inducing impacts of the Project, along with significant

19 impacts of the Project to City water supplies, wastewater collection and sewer services, and

20 roadways. Rather than address these and other concerns, however, the County rushed to certify a

21 final EIR for the Project on October 30, 2018, only ten days after its publication, and after the

22 release of more than 1,500 pages of new information and technical studies that were appended to
23 the EIR and Specific Plan on October 19, 2018. In the haste to promote job-creation, the County

24 ultimately certified an EIR that fails to meet the basic and mandatory requirements of

25 environmental review under CEQA.

{CW071131.8} 2
Churchwell White-* Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

For Patterson, the most troubling concerns regarding the EIR are that it improperly

2 analyzed, and failed to implement, feasible mitigation measures that are legally required under

3 CEQA to address long-term impacts to regional hydrology and water supply, City utilities and

4 public services, and local traffic and transportation networks.

5 In addition, throughout its analysis, the EIR relies on a faulty assumption that the

6 surrounding cities of Patterson and Newman have already planned for and taken into account the

7 massive amount of growth that would be needed to support the Project. However, just the opposite

8 is true. Local communities, including Patterson and Newman, have planned for future growth over

9 the next 20-30 years without evaluating or considering the additional, growth-inducing impacts

10 that the Project could create. The EIR therefore is unsupported by substantial evidence where it

11 relies on studies and reports, such as the Stanislaus County Council of Governments ("StanCOG")

12 Regional Housing Needs Assessment, which do not include the Project in their growth

13 assumptions or forecasts.

14 As a result of the EIR's flawed analysis and failure to implement feasible mitigation,
15 Respondents abused their discretion by certifying an invalid EIR on October 30, 2018, and by

16 improperly relying on the EIR when adopting the Project approvals on November 15 and
17 December 4, 2018.

18 Petitioner alleges as follows:

19 PARTIES

20 1. Patterson is a California municipal corporation, located in Stanislaus County, with

21 population of approximately 22,000 people. Patterson is a general a law city governed by the laws

22 of the State of California. The Project is located approximately 1.5 miles south of Patterson city

23 limits and Patterson's Urban Services Boundary/Sphere of Influence.

24 2. Patterson is responsible agency under CEQA, as the Project proposes to utilize

25 Patterson's wastewater treatment facility as the preferred option for processing future wastewater
26 flows from the Project site, and Patterson has not yet approved or agreed to accept wastewater
27 flows from the Project.

28 ///

{CW071131.8} 3
Churchwell White -* Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

3. Respondent County is a political subdivision of the State of California. Respondent

2 County is the CEQA lead agency for the Project. As lead agency, the County is responsible for

3 environmental review of the Project, which requires thorough analysis of the potential

4 environmental impacts and, if necessary, implementation of mitigation measures or Project

5 alternatives to minimize significant environmental impacts.

6 4. Respondent Board is a legislative body duly authorized under the California

7 Constitution and the laws of the State of California to act on behalf of the County. The Board is

8 responsible for regulating and controlling land use within the County, including, but not limited to,
9 implementing and complying with the provisions of CEQA and its implementing regulations

10 codified in the California Code of Regulations, title 14, section 15000 et seq. ("CEQA

11 Guidelines"). As the elected representatives of the people of the County, the Board establishes
12 County priorities and sets policy. The Board is the governing body of the County and is ultimately

13 responsible for certifying a valid EIR, reviewing the Project, and approving or denying the

14 Specific Plan based on the required findings under CEQA. The Board approved the Specific Plan,

15 General Plan Amendment, and Rezone Application No. PLN2013-0091 on December 4, 2018.

16 5. Respondent ALUC is political subdivision of the State of California. The ALUC

17 is the agency responsible for preparing the Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan ("ALUCP") for
18 each public-use airport in the County, as required by the California State Aeronautics Act (Pub.

19 Util. Code, § 21670 et seq.). The purpose of the ALUCP is to promote compatibility between a
20 public-use airport and land uses in its vicinity. To accomplish this, the ALUCP establishes a set of

21 compatibility criteria that the ALUC uses to evaluate the compatibility of land use and airport

22 proposals within the ALUC-established airport influence area. Respondent ALUC is a responsible
23 agency for the Project because the Project requires the ALUC's approval to amend the Stanislaus

24 County ALUCP. The ALUC approved the County ALUCP amendment on November 15, 2018.

25 6. Petitioner is informed and believes that there are no real parties in interest to the

26 petition because the County is the Project proponent.

27 7. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and identities of DOES 1 through 20,

28 inclusive, and sues such unnamed Respondents by their fictitious names. Petitioner is informed and

{(CW071131.8} 4

Churchwell White -: Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

P believes, and based thereon alleges, that fictitiously named Respondents are also responsible for all

2 acts and omissions described herein. When the true identities and capacities of Respondents have

3 been determined, Petitioner will, with leave of the Court if necessary, amend this Petition to

4 include such Respondents and capacities.

5 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

6 8. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to

7 Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, and Public Resources Code section 21168. In the

8 alternative, this Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to Code of

9 Civil Procedure section 1085, and Public Resources Code section 21168.5.

10 9. Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the State of California

11 in and for the County of Stanislaus pursuant to sections 393, 394, and 395 of the Code of Civil

12 Procedure.

13 BACKGROUND FACTS

14 10. The Project site is located in the unincorporated area of western Stanislaus County,
15 approximately 1.5 miles east of Interstate Highway 5 ("I-5"), 1.5 miles south of Patterson and 7.5
16 miles north of the City of Newman. The 1,528-acre property is bounded by West Marshall Road to
17 the north, State Route 33 to the northeast, Bell Road to the east, Fink Road to the south, and Davis

18 Road and agricultural land to the west. The Project site is generally surrounded by agricultural land

19 uses, with some residences in the vicinity, and the unincorporated community of Crows Landing is

20 located approximately 1.4 miles to the east. The Delta-Mendota Canal traverses the Project site in

21 a northwest-to-southeast direction. Regional access to the Project site would be provided by I-5

22 and State Route 33 ("Highway 33"), with local access provided by West Marshall Road at the

23 site's northern boundary and Ike Crow Road at its eastern boundary. Sperry Avenue and Fink

24 Road would provide access between the Project site and I-5.

25 11. From 1942 to 1999, the Project site was developed and used by the federal

26 government to support the missions of the United States Navy and Coast Guard as the Crows

27 Landing Naval Auxiliary Landing Field, and subsequently the National Aeronautics and Space

28 Administration ("NASA") as the NASA Crows Landing Airport.

{CW071131.8) 5
Churchwell White . Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

12. On or about October 27, 1999, Congress passed Public Law 106-82, which

2 directed NASA to convey the former military property to the County of Stanislaus.
3 13. On or about October 12, 2004, the Board accepted conveyance of the Project site

4 pursuant to Public Law 106-82.

5 14. Since acquiring title to the property, the County has contemplated various

6 proposals for the industrial reuse of the site. Previous proposals included a plan to connect the site

7 by rail to the Port of Oakland.

8 15. In 2008, voters in the County approved "Measure E," a "30-Year Land Use

9 Restriction Initiative." Measure E requires ballot approval by majority of County voters prior to

10 the Board approving any zone change to facilitate housing in agricultural zones in the County. As

11 result, residential development in the unincorporated areas of the County will be significantly more

12 difficult throughout the duration of Measure E.

13 16. The County has proceeded with the current iteration of the Project, since at least

14 2012 when the County issued request for proposals, seeking a master developer partner to

15 develop the Crows Landing Industrial Business Park. To Patterson's knowledge, however, no

16 master developer was selected or is currently associated with the Project. As a result, there are no

17 real parties in interest in this case and the County therefore is the lead Project proponent and the

18 lead agency under CEQA.

19 17. The Specific Plan identifies various land uses, including Aviation, Aviation-

20 compatible, Multimodal Access/Greenspace/Monument, Public Facilities, Logistics, Industrial,

21 and Business Park. These uses would be developed in three 10-year phases (i.e., 30 years) to

22 provide site development for approximately 14,000 to 15,000 jobs at full build-out. At full build-
23 out, the EIR estimated a total population of approximately 34,270 that would be directly related to
24 the jobs created by the Project.

25 18. On or about October 13, 2014, Respondents issued a notice of preparation
26 ("NOP") for the Project. The NOP comment period provided the first opportunity for Patterson to

27 submit formal comments as a responsible agency under CEQA regarding the Project.

28 ///

{CW071131.8} 6
Churchwell White -+ Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

19. On November 13, 2014, Patterson submitted a comment letter to Respondents on

2 the NOP. Patterson's comment letter stressed the need of the Draft EIR to fully analyze hydrology

3 and water quality; population and housing; public municipal services; parks, recreation, and open

4 spaces; transportation and traffic; utilities and service systems; cumulative impacts; and growth

5 inducing impacts. In particular, Patterson comments expressed concern that the EIR failed to

6 properly analyze the Project's cumulative impacts with other local planned development.

7 20. In March 2015, Patterson learned that the County was in discussions with Western

8 Hills Water District ("WHWD") to convey wastewater flows generated by the Project to WHWD,

9 which has an agreement in place with Patterson to convey residential flows to Patterson's

10 wastewater treatment facility. By conveying the Project's wastewater flows to WHWD, the County

11 was seeking to ultimately connect to Patterson's wastewater treatment facility without negotiating

12 directly with Patterson for the Project's fair-share costs of the necessary treatment capacity and

13 conveyance infrastructure to serve the Project.

14 21. Between 2015 and 2017, City and County staff met on numerous occasions in an

15 attempt to establish a more transparent process regarding the County's objectives for the Project.

16 After reviewing administrative drafts of the Specific Plan and EIR, Patterson staff determined that

17 the EIR was severely deficient, specifically with regard to its analysis of impacts on Patterson's

18 wastewater system and roadway network. During these meetings, City staff raised concerns
19 regarding the need to expand its wastewater facility to serve the Project, plus the lack of housing

20 inventory in Patterson to meet the demand that would be created by the Project.

21 22. In June 2017, the County agreed to reimburse Patterson for costs associated with

22 conducting a peer-review of the EIR and Specific Plan. Patterson engaged Black Water Consulting

23 Engineers, Inc. ("Black Water") to conduct a peer-review of the wastewater analysis in the

24 Specific Plan, and Stantec Consulting Services, Inc. ("Stantec") to conduct a peer-review of traffic

25 and transportation impacts of the Project on City roadways.

26 23. On or about January 22, 2018, Respondents issued a notice of availability of the

27 draft EIR ("Draft EIR").

28 //l

{CW071131.8} 7

Churchwell White -* Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

24. On or about April 26, 2018, Patterson, by and through its counsel of record,

2 submitted a comment letter in response to the Draft EIR, outlining several issues with the Draft

3 EIR and its analysis, including wastewater collection, conveyance, and treatment facilities; traffic

4 and transportation; population, housing, and employment; hydrology and water quality; public

5 services; project description; and cumulative impacts. Patterson's comment letter emphasized that

6 the Draft EIR failed to address concerns previously raised by the City and its technical consultants

7 regarding Project impacts on City services that are already at or near maximum capacity, including

8 wastewater treatment, water supply, local roadways, and housing. The comment letter also noted

9 that the EIR failed to properly analyze alternatives to the Project, including alternatives for treating

10 Project wastewater in the event Patterson would not or could not accept Project flows. The

11 comment letter further noted defects in the EIR's cumulative analysis of the Project, along with a

12 failure to mitigate impacts to several Patterson intersections that would degrade to unacceptable
13 levels of service.

14 25. On or about October 19, 2018, Respondents published the Final EIR, eight

15 appendices to the Final EIR, and a revised Specific Plan with numerous new appendices, totaling

16 more than 1,500 pages. On the same day, the County issued a notice of public hearing for the

17 Board to consider certification of the Final EIR on October 30, 2018.

18 26. On October 29, 2018, Patterson, by and through its counsel of record, submitted a
19 comment letter to Respondent Board of Supervisors outlining key issues with the EIR and its

20 analysis. On October 30, 2018, Patterson, by and through its legal counsel, submitted a

21 supplemental comment letter to the Board. These comment letters noted that the Final EIR did not

22 adequately respond to comments to the Draft EIR, and that the Final EIR contained significant new

23 information regarding Project impacts to groundwater that were previously not analyzed in the

24 Draft EIR.

25 27. On October 30, 2018, Respondent Board held a public meeting to consider

26 certification of the Final EIR, which the Board unanimously approved.

27 ///

28 ///

{CW071131.8} 8

Churchwell White-$ Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

28. On October 30, 2018, Respondents filed a notice of determination ("NOD") with

2 the County Clerk. Respondents filed the NOD prior to approving the Specific Plan or any other

3 land use entitlements related to the Project.

4 29. On November 6, 2018, Respondents issued public notices for the Stanislaus

5 County Planning Commission and ALUC to consider recommending to the Board approval of the

6 necessary Project entitlements, including the Specific Plan, General Plan Amendment, Rezone

7 Application No. PLN2013-0091, and final approval of Airport Land Use Commission Application

8 No. PLN2013-0091, at a meeting on November 15, 2018.

9 30. On November 14, 2018, Petitioner submitted comment letters to the Stanislaus

10 County Planning Commission and ALUC raising objections to the Project entitlements including

11 deficiencies of the EIR. Petitioner's comment letter also urged the County to enter into a

12 memorandum of understanding, to coordinate Patterson's timely delivery of wastewater services as

13 responsible agency for the Project, and to establish a pre-annexation agreement to extend

14 Patterson city limits in order to accommodate new residential development that would be needed

15 to accommodate future needs of projects within the City and the County's Specific Plan.
16 31. On November 15, 2018, the Stanislaus County Planning Commission and ALUC

17 held a public meeting to consider the Project entitlements, including the Specific Plan, General
18 Plan Amendment, Rezone Application No. PLN2013-0091, and Airport Land Use Commission

19 Application No. PLN2013-0091.

20 32. On November 15, the ALUC approved Airport Land Use Commission Application

21 No. PLN2013-0091 for the adoption of the Stanislaus County Airport Land Use Compatibility

22 Plan amendment.

23 33. On November 19, 2018, Respondents filed a second NOD following the ALUC's

24 adoption of the Stanislaus County Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan amendment.

25 34. On December 4, 2018, Respondent Board held a public meeting to consider the

26 Project entitlements, including the Specific Plan, General Plan Amendment, and Rezone

27 Application No. PLN2013-0091, which the Board unanimously approved.

28 ///

{CW071131.8} 9

Churchwell White- Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

- 35. On December 4, 2018, Respondents filed a third NOD following the Board's

2 approval of the Specific Plan, General Plan Amendment, and Rezone Application No. PLN2013-

3 0091.

4 36. Patterson brings this action to challenge the County's certification of the EIR for

5 the Specific Plan, on the basis that the County violated CEQA by certifying an invalid EIR, and

6 approving legally defective CEQA findings, prior to taking final action to approve the Project.
EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES AND INADEQUACY OF REMEDY

37. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant

9 action and has exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by

10 law.

11 38. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

12 21167.5 by mailing written notice of this action to the Respondents. A copy of this written notice

13 and proof of service are attached hereto as Exhibit A.

14 39. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.6 by

15 concurrently filing a request concerning preparation of the record of administrative proceedings

16 relating to this action.

17 40. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
18 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside their

19 certification of the EIR. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' approval will remain in

20 effect in violation of State law.

21 41. This action has been brought within 30 days of the filing of the NOD as required

22 by Public Resources Codes section 21167, subdivision (c). Respondents filed the first NOD on the

23 certification of the EIR with the County Clerk on October 30, 2018, even though no action was
24 taken relative to Project approval. Petitioner contends the October 30, 2018, NOD is defective but

25 is filing this Petition within thirty days of the posting of the first NOD. Respondents filed a second
26 NOD on November 19, 2018, after the ALUC's adoption of an amendment to the Stanislaus

F County ALUCP on November 15, 2018, and a third NOD on December 4, 2018, after the Board's

2 approval of the Specific Plan, General Plan Amendment, and Rezone Application No. PLN2013-

3 0091.

4 STANDING

5 42. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because

6 Petitioner's municipal services, public facilities, and transportation and traffic infrastructure will

7 be directly and adversely affected by Respondents' certification of the EIR and approval of the

8 Project. Further, Petitioner is a responsible agency under CEQA for the Project.

9 ARBITRARY AND CAPRICOUS ACTIONS

10 43. Petitioner brings this action on the basis, among others, of Government Code

11 section 800, and other applicable laws, which awards Petitioner attorneys' fees in actions to

12 overturn agency decisions that are arbitrary and capricious, such as the decisions in question herein.
13 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE

14 44. Petitioner brings this action as a private attorney general pursuant to Code of Civil
15 Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important rights
16 affecting the public. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a significant benefit
17 a on a large class of persons by ensuring that Respondents do not certify an EIR, approve a Project,
18 and illegally expend public funds in the absence of lawful environmental review.
19 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
20 Abuse of Discretion - Mitigation Measures Are Not Enforceable As Required By CEQA (Violation of CEQA, Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)
21 45. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein, as if set forth in full, each and every
22 allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 44.

23 46. In certifying the EIR and approving the Project as described herein, Respondent
24 prejudicially abused its discretion in violation of CEQA pursuant to Public Resources Code section
25 21168 and Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5. Respondents certified an EIR that fails to
26 include necessary information for informed decision making and informed public participation,
27 including necessary information to reach informed conclusions regarding the significance of the
28 Project's environmental impacts, the effectiveness of mitigation measures to avoid the Project's

{CW071131.8} 11
Churchwell White • Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

r significant environmental impacts, or feasibility of mitigation measures to reduce the Project's

2 significant environmental impacts; because the EIR fails to lawfully assess the cumulative effects;

3 because the EIR fails to use the best available information and/or accepted methodology for

4 analyzing information; because the EIR fails to provide good faith responses to comments on the

5 Draft EIR; because, with respect to the findings required by CEQA, Respondents failed to make

6 required findings, failed to support the findings with substantial evidence, and failed to disclose the

7 analytic route showing how the evidence supports the findings; and because the EIR impermissibly

8 defers analysis of impacts and development of mitigation measures to the future.

9 47. Petitioner alleges that Respondents violated CEQA as detailed in a number of

10 comment letters submitted by Petitioner and others during the administrative review process,

11 including, without limitation, the comment letters to Respondents by counsel for Petitioner.

12 Petitioner intends to prosecute all of the alleged violations of CEQA described herein and in the

13 documents and comments submitted to Respondents during the administrative review process. By

14 way of illustration, and without limitation, Petitioner alleges the following violations of CEQA by
15 the County:

16 A. The EIR Lacks Enforceable Mitigation Measures for Impacts to Groundwater

17 Resources.

18 48. The EIR relies upon a Groundwater Resources Impact Assessment, dated October

19 31, 2016, and prepared by Jacobson James & Associates, Inc. to evaluate and address the impacts

20 to groundwater resources from the Project. (Draft EIR, 3.10-28.)

21 49. The Groundwater Resources Impact Assessment provides four mitigation measures

22 to address the Project's impact to groundwater resources, including: (1) subsidence monitoring at
23 three locations on the Project site; (2) setbacks for shallow wells of at least 250 feet; (3)
24 groundwater level monitoring; and (4) a requirement that Project applicants prepare a plan to fully

25 offset any drawdown from the shallow groundwater aquifer underlying the Project site through
26 recharge. (Jacobson James & Associates, Groundwater Resources Impact Assessment, 5-5-5-7.)

27 50. The EIR incorporates the first three mitigation measures provided in the

28 Groundwater Resources Impact Assessment as Mitigation Measures 3.10-4a, 3.10-4b, and 3.10-4f,

{CW071131.8) 12
Churchwell White * Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 but fails to include an enforceable mitigation measure that addresses the plan for drawdown from

2 the Project from the shallow portion of the groundwater aquifer underlying the Project site.

3 51. Instead, the EIR relies on the Project's Specific Plan Water Policy WP 4, "a dual-

4 purpose stormwater pond in the northeastern portion of the project site," and performance and

5 design standards to address drawdown and recharge from the Project in the shallow aquifer

6 underlying the Project site that will be used for the Project's non-potable water supply. (Draft EIR,

7 3.10-43.) Relying upon these standards, the EIR alleges that the Project will not "result in any net

8 increase in groundwater demand from the shallow aquifer" despite the Groundwater Resources

9 Impact Assessment's finding that a plan to address drawdown from the shallow aquifer underlying

10 the Project through recharge is required. (Draft EIR, 3.10-43.)

11 52. The EIR states that the Project will induce drawdown in the tens of feet in the

12 confined aquifer that will be used for the Project's potable water supply. (Final EIR 2.3.6-69; Draft

13 EIR 3.10-43, Groundwater Resources Impact Assessment, 5-3.) The confined aquifer underlies the

14 Project site but is located beneath the shallow aquifer and separated from it by a layer of Corcoran

15 Clay. The Project is located in a critically over drafted basin and the identified drawdown will

16 contribute to additional overdraft, directly, and cumulatively.

17 53. Despite this, the EIR makes no finding of a significant impact from this drawdown,

18 offers no mitigation for the impact, and makes no finding of overriding consideration to approve

19 the Project. Additionally, there is no real analysis of any alternative water supply sources beyond

20 groundwater to avoid the drawdown impact.

21 54. The EIR also impermissibly delays implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.10-4b,

22 a groundwater level monitoring program, until the Groundwater Sustainability Plan ("GSP")

23 required under the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act is implemented. There is no clear

24 plan in place through Mitigation Measure 3.10-4b to address any reduction to groundwater levels

25 from the Project through this proposed mitigation measure because no groundwater monitoring

26. program has yet been developed or adopted through a GSP.

27 55. By failing to adopt the identified mitigation measure in the EIR, not addressing the

28 drawdown in the confined aquifer, and delaying adoption of a groundwater monitoring program

until the GSP is adopted, the Respondents have prejudicially abused their discretion by certifying

2 the EIR and approving the Project when it has not committed to enforceable mitigation measures

3 to address identified significant groundwater impacts of the Project.

4 B. The EIR Lacks Commitment to Enforceable Traffic Mitigations Measures.
56. The Draft EIR states that the Project will generate additional traffic and degrade

6 levels of service ("LOS") at several intersections. (Draft EIR, 3.14-15.) To address these

7 significant impacts, the EIR provides several mitigation measures. For instance, at the intersection

8 of Sperry Avenue and Highway 33, the EIR states that signalization will improve the condition to

9 LOS D or better. (Draft EIR, 3.14-15.) "However, the County cannot guarantee that this
10 improvement would be implemented since this would be under the jurisdiction of the City of

11 Patterson." (Ibid.) Further, the Final EIR acknowledges that Patterson will have to implement
12 transportation and traffic improvements within Patterson's jurisdiction to mitigate for the Project's
13 impacts. (Final EIR, 2.3.6-48, 2.3.6-49.) These improvements may include signalization and lane

14 widening. (Ibid.)

15 57. Appendix F of the EIR, the Transportation Infrastructure Plan, provides several

16 enforceable recommendations for mitigating the Project's impacts on traffic and transportation.

17 These recommendations include: establishment of a comprehensive strategy to reduce solo

18 occupant vehicle travel by employees, business vehicles including trucks, and visitors; establishing
19 designated transportation demand management organization that requires mandatory

20 involvement by all companies within the Project and assigning a person representing the Project on

21 an ongoing basis to coordinate with individual businesses; requiring each individual business

22 within the Project to establish a designated transportation demand management company

23 representative; requiring the transportation demand management organization to include annual

24 mandatory employee surveys with a required response rate of at least 90 percent of employees; and

25 requiring the transportation demand management company to prepare an annual report indicating

26 status of compliance with transportation demand management goals established by the County.

27 (Appendix F, 41-42.)

58. Respondents cannot abdicate their responsibility to analyze and mitigate

2 significant impacts because certain intersections are outside their jurisdiction. Respondents must

3 commit to enforceable mitigation measures, especially where they are identified in reports

4 prepared for the Specific Plan.

59. As a mitigation measure, the Final EIR focuses on the County directing

6 leaseholders, developers, and contractors to reimburse Patterson for its fair-share of costs for off-
site transportation and traffic improvements and implementation of mitigation measures. (Final

8 EIR, 2.3.6-48, 2.3.6-49.)

60. However, it the EIR does not require nor does it impose an enforceable mechanism

10 for leaseholders, developers, and contractors to pay their fair-share of transportation and traffic

11 improvement costs to Patterson. The EIR merely states that Respondents will facilitate the transfer

12 of fair-share costs. Agreeing to facilitate the transfer of funds is not the same as a binding

13 commitment. The EIR may not rely on future mitigation measures such as these that are vague and

14 unenforceable. In addition, the EIR fails to implement enforceable mitigation measures

15 recommended in the Transportation Infrastructure Plan.

16 61. Respondents have prejudicially abused their discretion by certifying the EIR and

17 approving a Project that has failed to impose enforceable mitigation measures and failed to

18 incorporate measures proposed by the Project's own appendices to the Specific Plan.

19 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

20 Abuse of Discretion - The EIR Contains an Inaccurate Project Description (Violation of CEQA, Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)
21 62. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein, as if set forth in full, each and every

22 allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 61.

23 63. The EIR project description fails to identify approvals for the Project that would be

24 needed from Stanislaus County Local Agency Formation Commission ("LAFCO") in order for

25 Patterson's WQCF to provide wastewater treatment, namely approval of an out-of-boundary

26 service agreement or establishing Patterson's WQCF as a regional facility.

27 64. In order to serve the Project, LAFCO must approve an out of boundary service

28 agreement, or alternative steps must be taken to establish the WQCF as a regional facility.

{CW071131.8} 15
Churchwell White -. Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

- 65.

2 The EIR identifies LAFCO's role in the Project as approving a Community

3 Service Area to manage the provision of services and maintenance of infrastructure for the
Specific Plan Area.

4 66.

5 CEQA requires that the full level of development and use being authorized by an

6 approval must be analyzed and its effect mitigated. The EIR fails to meet this standard.

67. The inclusion of a clear and comprehensive description of the Project is critical to
an EIR's accurate analysis of impacts and meaningful public review. The EIR failed to meet this
requirement.

68.

10 The EIR project description is misleading and therefore the Board's certification of

11 the EIR constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion where the EIR failed to accurately portray the

12 required steps for Patterson's WQCF to serve the Project, and especially where the required steps

13 would result in significant, new growth-inducing and cumulative impacts.
THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

14 Abuse of Discretion - Significant New Information Required Recirculation of the EIR

15 69. (Violation of CEQA, Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)

16 Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein, as if set forth in full, each and every
allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 68.

17 70. In the Draft EIR, the discussion of growth inducing impacts is very short,
18 approximately one-page long. The Draft EIR discusses how the Project's approximately 14,000 to
19

20 15,000 jobs will lead to additional housing demand in the County and region. (Draft EIR, 5-43.)

21 However, the Draft EIR does not discuss where the additional housing demand may be located and

22 whether there is enough additional housing in the area to accommodate the job growth and
accompanying population growth.

23 71.

24 The Final EIR estimates that 15,000 employees would generate a population of

25 approximately 34,270. (Final EIR, 2.2-5.) Assuming the County's current average household size,

26 11,200 new housing units would be needed to house the expected population growth. (Final EIR,

27 2.2-5.) The EIR proposes that the increased population growth is likely to locate in Newman,
//l

28 I/l

{CW071131.8}
Churchwell White- 16
Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

F Patterson, Turlock, and the County-wide unincorporated area. (Final EIR, 2.2-5.) The EIR states

2 that Newman, Patterson, Turlock, and the County-wide unincorporated area will develop enough

3 housing to fully accommodate the increased population growth. (Final EIR, 2.2-5.)

4 72. The EIR added significant new information regarding the Project's growth

5 inducing impacts, where that population growth may locate, and whether those areas have housing

6 capacity to accommodate that growth.

7 73. The addition of significant new information without recirculating the EIR deprived

8 the public of a meaningful opportunity to comment on substantial adverse project impacts, feasible

9 mitigation measures, or alternatives before certification of the EIR.

10 74. In particular, as discussed further below, Patterson will be substantially harmed by

11 the Project's growth inducing impacts because Patterson is the closest incorporated city to the
12 Project. A significant portion of the Project's growth inducing impacts is likely to locate in

13 Patterson and Newman, including population growth and housing. Thus, Patterson and Newman
14 were wholly deprived of any meaningful opportunity to comment on how the Project's growth
15 inducing impacts will directly affect them because the Draft EIR did not include this information.

16 75. By failing to recirculate the EIR for additional comments based on the significant
17 new information added to the EIR, Respondents have prejudicially abused their discretion in

18 certifying the EIR and approving the Project.

19 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
Abuse of Discretion -The EIR's Impact Analysis Is Insufficient 20 (Violation of CEQA, Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)
21 76. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein, as if set forth in full, each and every

22 allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 75.

23 77. Allegations in this Petition regarding the failure of the EIR to adequately analyze

24 impacts includes the conclusion that the EIR improperly made various assumptions in analyzing

25 the Project's impacts. The EIR improperly assumes that local planning documents already account

26 for and accommodate the Project's growth inducing and cumulative impacts. The EIR improperly

27 assumes that most, if not all, forecasted local growth is one and the same as the Project's growth

28 inducing impacts. However, the EIR fails to recognize that local jurisdictions have projected their

{CW071131.8} 17
Churchwell White * Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

F own growth, separate and aside from the Project's growth inducing impacts and therefore these

2 other documents omitted growth inducing impacts produced by the Project. An analysis of local

3 growth and Project-induced growth, taken and reviewed together, will reveal significant

4 environmental impacts that have not been analyzed by Respondents. This flaw in the EIR's

5 analysis is revealed when individual components of the EIR are reviewed, including Project

6 induced growth; municipal services, including schools, parks, and other recreational facilities;

7 transportation and traffic; water supply; wastewater and sewer; and cumulative impacts.

8 A. Growth Induced Housing

9 78. The EIR estimates that full buildout of the Project will result in the creation of

10 14,000 to 15,000 new jobs within the Specific Plan area. (Final EIR, 2.2-4.) Since approximately
11 44 percent of the County's total population is in the labor force, the EIR estimates that 15,000

12 employees would generate population of approximately 34,270. (Final EIR, 2.2-5.) Assuming the

13 County's current average household size, 11,200 new housing units would be needed to house the

14 expected population growth. (Final EIR, 2.2-5.)

15 79. One of the overarching Project objectives is to develop high-quality employment
16 opportunities within the County. The EIR must analyze the Project consistent with its objectives.
17 80. Patterson and Newman are the only two incorporated cities on the west side of

18 Stanislaus County. Each city is located near to the Project. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that

19 most of the Project's employees will relocate in Patterson or Newman, especially in light of the

20 Measure E development restrictions on unincorporated parts of the County.

21 81. Patterson currently has a population of approximately 22,100. The City of
22 Newman currently has population of approximately 11,300. Together Patterson and Newman

23 have an approximate population of 33,400. A population increase of 34,270 would more than

24 double the current populations of Patterson and Newman alone. While the EIR, without substantial

25 evidence to support this assumption, anticipates that population growth will be spread between

26 Patterson, Newman, Turlock, and unincorporated area, Patterson and Newman will likely absorb a

27 majority of the growth because they are the two closest incorporated cities to the Project.

28 ///

{CW071131.8} 18
Churchwell White -+ Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

82. The EIR then relies on County planning documents to state that the local

2 community sufficiently projects enough additional housing to accommodate for the Project's

3 induced housing needs. (Final EIR, 2.2-5.) Specifically, the Final EIR relies on the 2014 Regional

4 Transportation Plan and the Sustainable Communities Strategy's ("RTP/SCS") and 2014-2023
Stanislaus Council of Governments ("StanCOG") Regional Housing Needs Plan ("RHNA").

83. The Final EIR cites the RTP/SCS forecast that 16,000 additional housing units will

7 be built in the Patterson, Newman, and County-wide unincorporated area between 2020 and 2040.

8 (Final EIR, 2.2-5.) The Final EIR also cites the StanCOG RHNA to extrapolate data regarding how

9 many housing units will be built in the area during the Project's buildout.' (Final EIR, 2.2-5.)

10 Based on this questionable methodology, the Final EIR estimates that 18,256 housing units will be

11 built between 2020 to 2040 in Newman, Patterson, Turlock, and the County-wide unincorporated
12 area. (Final EIR, 2.2-5.) Thus, the EIR concludes that the local community "will be planning for
13 housing in excess of what would be necessary to house employees of the Specific Plan Area."

14 (Final EIR, 2.2-5.)

15 84. However, the RTP/SCS and StanCOG RHNA do not contemplate the Project and

16 its potential growth inducing impacts. The Project is not even discussed in those documents. The

17 Final EIR's conclusion that sufficient housing will be available to meet the Project's growth
18 inducing impacts is not based on substantial evidence. Respondents prejudicially abused their

19 discretion by certifying the EIR.

20 85. The Final EIR's flaw in relying on the local community to accommodate its

21 growth inducing impacts is further revealed when examining planning documents for the cities of

22 Patterson and Newman.

23 86. The City adopted its most recent general plan amendments in 2010, before the

24 current iteration of the Project was conceived. The individual elements of the Patterson General

25

26 1 The StanCOG RHNA is based on a 10-year timeframe. However, the Final EIR uses the StanCOG RHNA numbers to calculate the number of housing units that will be built over 20-years. The StanCOG RHNA numbers do not
27 represent the best available methodology to calculate expected housing buildout over 20 years. Further, in this portion of the Final EIR, it discusses the Project's buildout over a span of 20 years. However, the Draft EIR specifically

28 states that the Project is estimated to be in built in three 10-year phases, over 30 years. The Project description is not consistent.

{CW071131.8} 19
Churchwell White -e Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

Plan and its other supporting documents do not contemplate, consider, nor accommodate for the

2 Project's growth inducing impacts, let alone mention the Project in any meaningful way.

3 87. Since the Patterson General Plan does not discuss the Project, the local growth

4 projection is made without taking the Project's demand for housing into account. Thus, the EIR did

5 not analyze cumulative impacts from Patterson's projected growth together with the Project's

6 growth inducing impacts. Due to the cumulative impacts from the Project and local growth, there

7 will not be adequate housing to meet future demand in the area.

8 88. While the local community may have forecasted additional housing demand due to

9 their own projected growth, the EIR falsely assumes that these growth forecasts take into account

10 the Project's induced growth. Local planning documents do not discuss the Project, nor

11 accommodate for the Project's induced growth. Thus, there is no substantial evidence to support

12 the EIR's assumption that the local community has accounted for and will accommodate the

13 Project's growth inducing impacts.

14 89. Further, it is an abuse of discretion for the EIR to rely on housing development in
15 the unincorporated areas of the County. Following the adoption of Measure E, residential
16 development in the unincorporated areas of the County are substantially more difficult to approve
17 and less likely to be developed. No substantial evidence supports the finding that the
18 unincorporated areas of the County can support housing development for the Project's growth

19 inducing impacts. Respondents' reliance on baseless assumptions in the EIR to approve the Project

20 entitlements is arbitrary and capricious.

21 B. Municipal Services

22 90. The Draft EIR incorrectly assumes that no additional schools, parks, recreational

23 facilities, or other public facilities (e.g., libraries) will be necessary because the Project does not

24 include residential development. (Draft EIR, 3.13-1, 5-28.) Further, the Draft EIR states that "[t]he
25 County has elected not to speculate as to whether there would be any population-related

26 cumulative impact related to schools, parks and recreational facilities, or other types of public
27 services and facilities to which the project could contribute." (Draft EIR, 5-29-30, emphasis in

28 original.)

{CW071131.8} 20
Churchwell White : Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

- 91. The Project cannot assume that no additional schools, parks, recreational facilities,

2 and other public facilities will be necessary merely because the Project itself does not include

3 residential development. While the EIR need not speculate, it must analyze reasonably foreseeable

4 impacts.

5 92. The EIR clearly projects that the Project's growth inducing impacts will result in

6 direct population growth of 34,270 residents to the local community. A significant amount of this

7 population growth will likely be concentrated in the two nearest incorporated cities of Patterson

8 and Newman. This population growth could double the current populations of Patterson and

9 Newman.

10 93. These new residents will cause an increase in intensity of use to local schools,

11 parks, recreational facilities, and other public facilities. Existing public facilities will not be

12 sufficient to accommodate all the new residents. Additional school facilities, parks, recreational

13 facilities, and other public facilities will need to be constructed to accommodate the significant

14 population increase and change in intensity of use of existing facilities.

15 94. In Stanislaus County, approximately 27.1 percent of the County is younger than 18
16 years old and thus of schooling age. Assuming the Project induced population growth will have

17 similar age characteristics, a population increase of 34,270 would also increase the school age

18 population by approximately 9,287.

19 95. The Patterson Joint Unified School District has an enrollment of approximately

20 5,500 students. The Newman-Crows Landing Unified School District has an enrollment of

21 approximately 3,000 students. The Patterson Joint and Newman-Crows Landing Unified School

22 Districts have a combined a enrollment of 8,500 students-less than the estimated 9,000 Project-

23 related student population growth.

24 96. If a majority of the Project growth inducing student population were to attend

25 schools in Patterson Joint and Newman-Crows Landing Unified School Districts, school facilities

26 would have to effectively double. A significant amount of construction would be necessary to

27 double existing school facilities to accommodate the increased student population resulting from

28 Project-induced growth. This construction will lead to physical impacts on the environment,

{CW071131.8} 21
Churchwell White -. Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

including, but not limited to, dust and noise from construction activities. The EIR failed to analyze

2 impacts related to building new school facilities. Further, increased traffic resulting from trips to

3 and from new school facilities was not analyzed. Project-related impacts on local schools is not

4 speculative. This is a clear and foreseeable impact under CEQA that the EIR is required to analyze.

97. Similarly, the increased population is likely to increase the intensity of use of parks,

6 recreational facilities, and other public facilities. The record contains no evidence of overall usage

7 or capacity of public facilities. Moreover, the EIR makes no attempt to determine the current use
of schools, parks, recreational facilities, or other public facilities by existing residents or to

9 extrapolate from such data estimated increased usage by an additional 34,270 residents.

10 98. The EIR falsely assumes that the additional schools and public facilities necessary

11 to service the Project are speculative. These environmental impacts are clear and foreseeable. As

12 an information document, the EIR failed to contain sufficient information to enable Respondents to

13 properly consider the Project's environmental consequences related to schools, parks, recreational

14 facilities, and other public facilities. By relying on the EIR to approve the Project entitlements,

15 Respondents acted in a manner that is arbitrary and capricious, and an abuse of discretion.

16 C. Traffic

17 99. The Draft EIR analyzes the Project's traffic impacts in sections 3.14 and 5-30

18 through 5-36 and in Appendix F, Transportation Infrastructure Plan, of the Draft EIR. The EIR's

19 traffic analysis wrongly assumes that the Project's impacts to traffic are synonymous with local

20 traffic patterns. Thus, the EIR understates the Project's true impacts to traffic and transportation.

21 100. The EIR uses outdated traffic and trip data information from 2013 and 2014. Since

22 then, numerous projects in Patterson have been developed and continue to be developed, including,
23 but not limited to, large logistics center projects, gas stations, housing projects, and other

24 developments that contribute to localized traffic within Patterson and along Sperry Avenue. The
25 logistic center projects generate a high number of trips. Examples of logistics projects in Patterson
26 include the Amazon Warehouse, Restoration Hardware distribution center, and high volume

27 adjacent uses such as the Pilot Flying trucking service center and gas station.

28 ///

{CW071131.8} 22
Churchwell White- Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

101. The Final EIR stated that the Draft EIR traffic analysis was sufficient because it

2 took into consideration buildout of Patterson's General Plan, which was adopted in 2010 and

3 updated in 2014. (Final EIR, 2.3.6-48.) However, hypothetical data generated by contemplating

4 Patterson's General Plan is not as effective as using actual, recent traffic data. The new data more

5 accurately reflects traffic conditions in Patterson for roads that will feed into the Project site.

6 Instead of relying on hypothetical models, the EIR should have used more recent, actual traffic

7 data to study the cumulative effects of the Project on local roadways. By relying on outdated data,

8 the EIR's traffic analysis severely understated traffic impacts of the Project.

9 102. Further, the Draft EIR relies upon Patterson's existing plans to expand the number
10 of lanes on Patterson roads, including Sperry Avenue. Those plans were made before the Project

11 was proposed and the Project was not considered as part of Patterson's expansion plans.
12 Consequently, it is not clear that Patterson's roadways will be sufficient to serve both Patterson's
13 and the Project's needs. No study has been done to determine if the proposed expansion will
14 provide the correct level of service. Thus, it is likely that further roadway improvements will be
15 necessary to accommodate cumulative impacts of both the Project and growth in Patterson.
16 D. Water Supply

17 1. Water Supply Assessment

18 103. The Project relies entirely on groundwater to provide both potable and non-potable

19 water necessary to meet Project demand. (Draft EIR, 3.10-41.) This reliance will increase overall

20 groundwater use compared to existing conditions and require three new groundwater wells to be
21 drilled, two in the deep, confined aquifer and one in the shallow unconfined aquifer underlying the

22 Project site. (Draft EIR 3.10-41.) Full buildout of the Project is anticipated to require 2,819 acre

23 feet of water per year and to result in 13 feet of drawdown from the deep, confined aquifer that

24 will provide the Project's potable water. (Draft EIR 3.10-43.)

25 I//

26 Ill

27 ///

28 ///

{CW071131.8} 23
Churchwell White -.• Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

104. The projections included in the EIR are based on the Groundwater Resources

2 Impact Assessment prepared by Jacobson James and Associates, dated October 31, 2016. (Draft

3 EIR 3.10-42.) The Groundwater Resources Impact Assessment does not account for any

4 population growth that the Project will induce. (Groundwater Resources Impact Assessment, 2-2;

5 SB 610 Water Assessment, 3-33-5.)

6 105. While the employees and visitors to the Project are accounted for in the
7 Groundwater Resources Impact Assessment, the demand projection improperly ignores the

8 problem of supplying water to the growth in population that results from the Project. Ignoring this

9 additional demand means that the projected demand and drawdown included in the EIR

10 understates the groundwater resources impact of the Project.

11 106. That understatement calls into question the Project's ability to rely on groundwater

12 as the source for all potable and non-potable water demands. With this uncertainty, there must be
13 discussion of possible replacement sources and an evaluation of the environmental impacts of

14 those replacements. The EIR lacks this analysis.

15 107. The Water Supply Assessment required under SB 610, which was prepared by

16 AECOM and is dated in February 2016, shares this same deficiency. (SB 610 Water Assessment,

17 3-3-3-5.) The Water Supply Assessment evaluates the Project's demand for water without
18 considering any growth that will result from the Project and the resulting increased demand on the

19 groundwater basin underlying the Project site. This failure means that the Water Supply

20 Assessment does not provide an accurate analysis of the amount of water the Project may need.

21 108. The understatement of the Project's demand once again calls into question the
22 ability of the basin to provide groundwater to meet the Project's need, especially where the

23 understated demand numbers already result in drawdown and the basin is already in overdraft.

24 The SB 610 Water Assessment lacks any real discussion of replacement or alternative water

25 sources, dismissing all other surface water supply options as unreliable because opportunities to

26 secure such supply are scarce.

27 ///

{CW071131.8} 24
Churchwell White-* Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

2. Change in Recharge

2 109. The Project site's current use as agricultural land "represent[s] a substantial source

3 of groundwater recharge, since a significant portion of the applied irrigation water and stormwater

4 percolates through the soil to the aquifer." (Draft EIR 3.10-40.) The Draft EIR then alleges that
recharge will be available in an amount to offset the Project's "demand for [groundwater] in excess
of historical average." (Draft EIR 3.10-42.) While at the same time, the Draft EIR also
acknowledges that "the construction of approximately 1,000 acres of impervious surfaces would
reduce the amount of water available for local groundwater recharge." (Draft EIR 3.10-41.)

9 110. The ability to provide recharge that offsets the Project's demand is based on the

10 mitigation measure that was not included in the EIR: a required recharge enhancement plan "that

11 describes how the Project will achieve sufficient recharge to fully offset any additional

12 groundwater demand on the shallow aquifer imposed by the Project." (Groundwater Resources

13 Impact Assessment, 2-2.)

14 111. This analysis appears to address the reduction in recharge from the increase in
15 impervious surfaces, but upon closer inspection makes no such mitigation. Instead, the analysis

16 rejects the mitigation measure of a recharge enhancement plan and relies on other strategies such

17 as low impact development standards, a detention basin, alteration to the streambed of Little

18 Salado Creek, and landscape strategies to address recharge.

19 112. Relying on these strategies improperly assumes that the strategies identified are

20 sufficient to address the reduction in groundwater recharge from the impervious surface without

21 ever doing project specific analysis that would be included in a recharge enhancement plan. The

22 Groundwater Resources Impact Assessment that the EIR relies upon identifies these strategies as

23 approaches to address recharge, but specifically requires the recharge enhancement plan that the

24 EIR lacks.

25 113. The EIR's analysis of recharge applies only to the shallow aquifer and fails to

26 address recharge of the confined aquifer that is located below the Corcoran Layer between the two

27 aquifers that underlie the Project site. The confined aquifer is subject to drawdown, but no

28 recharge is contemplated to mitigate that impact. The Project is located in an overdrafted basin and

{CW071131.8} 25
Churchwell White -: Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

any additional drawdown must be analyzed and mitigated, if possible.

2 114. This failure is exacerbated by the EIR's lack of analysis for supplying water to the

3 population that will accompany the individuals that will be employed at the Project. The water

4 supply analysis only addresses water supply for individuals employed at the Project, thus,
drawdown will be higher once all water users, as a consequence of the Project, are analyzed.

6 115. Thus, the analysis of impacts to water supply from the Project is deficient,

7 116. and the reliance on the EIR is an abuse of discretion.

8 3. Water discharges to the San Joaquin River

9 117. To address flood waters, the Project proposes a 380-acre-foot capacity detention

10 pond to reduce flood water flows to equal to or less than existing conditions and then release water

11 slowly from that basin following storm events. (Draft EIR 3.10-32.)

12 118. The Draft EIR acknowledges that this plan will result in hydromodification effects
13 and requires that the County and project applicants prepare site-specific hydromodification studies
14 to address the changes in drainage that result from the Project. (3.10-35-36.)

15 119. These studies are not specifically required to address any changes to runoff or

16 recharge to the San Joaquin River and the hydrologically connected shallow aquifer near the San

17 Joaquin River. Instead, these studies focus on ensuring that water quality and other runoff impacts
18 are mitigated. The EIR assumes that runoff will increase, not decrease as a consequence of the
19 change to the use of retention basin. The potential for the retention basin to reduce runoff and

20 discharge to the San Joaquin River is not considered.

21 120. Additionally, as part of the proposed plan to revise the drainage and discharge for
22 the Project, the EIR proposes to increase the width of the channel bottom of Little Salado Creek.

23 (Draft EIR 3.10-30.) That plan fails to incorporate the procedural requirements of securing
24 regulatory permits such as those provided by the United States Army Corps of Engineers and
25 Regional Water Quality Control Boards as part of the mitigation measures for that portion of the
26 Project.

5 122. Though the EIR identifies onsite wastewater treatment as an option during initial

6 phases of the Project and as an interim measure, the EIR assumes that Patterson's wastewater

7 treatment facility, the Patterson Water Quality Control Facility ("WQCF"), will ultimately be

8 responsible for processing and accommodating the entirety of the Project's wastewater flows.

9 (Draft EIR, 3.15-16; Final EIR 2.3.6-42.)

10 123. It is uncertain if the WQCF will have capacity to meet Project needs as Patterson

11 "did not account for the [P]roject's wastewater flows in its planned design expansion" and

12 "capacity may need to be added to the WQCF to serve one or more phases of the Project." (Draft

13 EIR 3.15-17; Final EIR 2.3.6-44.) The required expansion to serve the Project and meet

14 Patterson's anticipated needs is neither currently planned nor funded, and additional expansion

15 phases contemplated in the EIR are beyond Patterson's anticipated expansion plans for the WQCF.

16 124. To address this, the EIR requires that before the County issues any building permit

17 for a project to connect to wastewater infrastructure, the applicant for the building permit will "be

18 required to provide written documentation to verify that existing treatment capacity is, or will be,

19 available at the WQCF to support the proposed development" and those "projects within the

20 [Project] shall contribute on a fair-share basis the cost associated with such treatment capacity."

21 (Final EIR 2.3.6-42.)

22 125. The EIR did not address issues raised by Black Water's technical memorandum

23 reviewing the Specific Plan and the scaling of Patterson's WQCF expansion to serve the Project.
24 For example, if the Patterson WQCF is expanded to serve the Project, the expansion would result
25 in only 50% utilization based on the projected flows from the Project. The EIR ignores any
26 growth-inducing impacts related to the remaining, unused treatment capacity that would be created

27 by a massive expansion of the WQCF.

28 ///

{CW071131.8} 27
Churchwell White Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

126. This massive oversizing will induce additional growth in Patterson, as the WQCF

2 will be available to a serve a significantly larger city population. The EIR does not address this, and

3 numerous other growth-inducing impacts of the Project.

4 127. In addition, the statutory requirements for Patterson to provide wastewater services

5 outside its jurisdictional boundaries will also induce growth that the EIR fails to address. The

6 provision of wastewater services outside of city limits must comply with Government Code section
56133 or other applicable laws under the Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Local Government
Reorganization Act of 2000, Government Code section 56000 et. seq. The Draft and Final EIR do
not accurately describe the necessary steps for Patterson to accept wastewater flows from the

10 Project. The EIR should have properly analyzed the requisite legal process for serving the Project,

11 through an out of boundary service agreement or creation of a regional wastewater treatment

12 facility, and as a result the EIR should have concluded that the Project would induce significant

13 new growth.

14 128. Failing to address these impacts from the Project's reliance on Patterson's WQCF

15 makes the EIR insufficient as an informational document for the Respondent and the general

16 public to properly consider the environmental consequences of the Project. Thus, the

17 Respondent's reliance on the EIR is an abuse of discretion.

18 F. Air Quality

19 129. Chapter 3.2 of the Draft EIR discusses air quality impacts and focuses on impacts

20 from construction emissions, operational emissions, with operational emissions from mobile

21 sources limited to vehicle trips from "employees, visitors, and goods movement." (Draft EIR, 3.2-

22 28.)

23 130. The EIR fails to analyze air quality impacts from the Project's growth inducing
24 impacts. Particularly, the Project will increase the local population by approximately 34,270.
25 While the EIR accounts for portion of the population increase as employees of the Project, the
26 remaining portion of the population increase and its impacts on air quality are not discussed in the
27 EIR.

28 //l

{CW071131.8} 28
Churchwell White-* Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

131. Further, the increased population will require the local community to engage in

2 additional construction activities, such as building schools, parks, recreational facilities, and

3 improving roads. The EIR failed to analyze these direct, foreseeable impacts.

4 132. The EIR understates and underestimates the Project's air quality impacts. As a

5 result, the EIR fails as an informational document. By relying on an invalid EIR to approve the

6 Project, Respondents have prejudicially abused their discretion.

7 G. Greenhouse Gas Emissions

8 133. The Draft EIR concludes that the Project's greenhouse gas impacts will be

0 "cumulatively considerable." (Draft EIR, 3.7-16.) The Draft EIR analyzes greenhouse gas

10 emissions from construction-related emissions and operational emissions. (Draft EIR, 3.7-16-17.)

11 134. The EIR does not analyze greenhouse gas emissions associated with its growth
12 inducing impacts. Thus, the EIR underestimates and understates the Project's greenhouse gas
13 emissions.

14 H. Cumulative Impacts

15 135. The EIR underestimates the extent its growth inducing impacts will affect the
16 environment. Thus, the EIR failed to evaluate the true severity and significance of the cumulative
17 impacts from the Project. By understating information in the EIR, Respondents could not properly
18 consider and adopt appropriate and effective mitigation measures, skewing its perspective
19 concerning the benefits of the particular project under consideration, and precludes it from gaining

20 true perspective on the consequences of approving the project. Thus, the EIR fails as an
21 informational document and Respondents abused their discretion by relying on the EIR to approve
22 the Project.

23 1. Growth Inducing Impacts

24 136. The Project is estimated to create 14,000 to 15,000 jobs and increase the local

25 population by approximately 34,270, which will require approximately 11,200 new residential
26 units. (Final EIR, 2.2-5.) The EIR assumes that the local community will develop enough housing
27 during Project buildout to accommodate the Project's growth inducing housing requirements.

28 (Final EIR, 2.2-5.) The EIR cites the StanCOG RTP/SCS to state that the County population could

{CW071131.8} 29
Churchwell White Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

increase by 37 percent and employment by 35 percent between 2008 and 2040. (Draft EIR, 5.30.)

2 Thus, the EIR admits that the cumulative impact of regional growth could "require additional

3 facilities to be constructed, the construction of which could have potentially significant impacts.

4 This is a significant cumulative impact." (Draft EIR, 5-30.)

5 137. The EIR fails to consider that the StanCOG RTP/SCS does not consider the

6 Project's growth inducing impacts in its analysis. The Project could create additional population

7 and employment growth beyond what is projected in the RTP/SCS. Thus, the EIR underestimates

8 and understates its growth inducing impacts on the environment. The County's increase in

9 population and employment could be substantially higher when the Project's growth inducing

10 impacts are taken into account. The additional resources and housing necessary to accommodate

11 the extra population growth will be more than the EIR estimated.

12 138. By understating and underestimating its growth inducing impacts, the EIR fails to
13 properly analyze the Project's environmental impacts and fails to commit to sufficient enforceable

14 mitigation measures.

15 2. Municipal Services

16 139. The Project is estimated to create 14,000 to 15,000 jobs and increase the local

17 population by approximately 34,270. Of the population growth, approximately 9,200 are estimated
18 to be school-aged children. This increase in population and school-aged children could double the

19 population of nearby Patterson and Newman and their respective school districts. The increased

20 population will also increase the intensity of use of parks, recreational facilities, and other public

21 services and facilities. To accommodate doubling its population and school enrollment, Patterson

22 and Newman will be forced to build new schools, parks, recreational facilities, and other public

23 services and facilities. However, the EIR elected not to speculate as to such impacts on public

24 services and recreation. (Draft EIR 5-29-30.)

25 140. Other planned developments in Patterson and Newman, such as the Villages of
26 Patterson, will also increase the local population and school-aged children population. These

27 cumulative effects are not speculative. The EIR failed to analyze the Project's growth inducing

28 impacts with the impacts of other development in the County on public services and recreation.

{CW071131.8} 30
Churchwell White -.+ Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

These cumulative impacts will be significant and must be mitigated. To mitigate against these

2 impacts to schools, parks, recreational facilities, and other public services and facilities, the EIR

3 should have analyzed establishing : public services and facilities demand program and requiring

4 all leaseholders, developers, and contractions to participate in the program by paying their fair-

5 share.

6 3. Traffic

7 141. The EIR claims to have considered the impacts of both the Patterson General Plan

8 buildout and the buildout of the Project. (Final EIR, 2.3.6-39.) To mitigate against the cumulative

9 impacts of the Project on transportation and traffic infrastructure, the EIR focuses on signalization

10 and lane widening. In particular, the EIR relies on Patterson's plans to implement some of these

11 mitigation measures that are outside the County's jurisdiction.

12 142. Patterson's plans to widen lanes or add signals to specific intersections were

13 developed without consideration of the Project's traffic impacts. While the EIR analyzed buildout

14 of the Patterson General Plan and Project, the EIR failed to analyze how the Project's growth

15 inducing impacts will also impact transportation and traffic infrastructure. Since the Project does

16 not include residential, the EIR's traffic analysis focuses on trips to and from the Project site

17 related to employment. (See Draft EIR, 3.14-13.) Further, Patterson's General Plan and lane

18 widening projects do not taken into account the additional traffic impacts generated by the

19 Project's growth inducing impacts. Thus, the planned mitigation measures may be insufficient to
20 accommodate buildout of the Patterson General Plan, buildout of the Project, and the Project's

21 growth inducing impacts on population and traffic.

22 143. By failing to also analyze traffic related to the Project's growth inducing impacts,

23 the EIR grossly understates and underestimates the impact the Project will have on traffic and

24 transportation.

25 4. Wastewater Treatment Facilities

26 144. The Draft EIR states that the Project will "accelerate the need for WQCF

27 expansion."(Draft EIR, 5-41.) The EIR focuses on the County contributing its fair-share basis to

28 fund necessary improvements to expand the City's WQCF to accommodate the Project's demand.

(CW071131.8} 31
Churchwell White Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

(Draft EIR, 5-39.) However, the Draft EIR incorrectly concludes that since "the County would not

2 have any role in the design, location, phasing, or operation [of Patterson's WQCF], the County
would not be able to identify methods to reduce or avoid environmental effects of the planning

4 phase or impose mitigation." (Draft EIR, 5-41.) Thus, the cumulative impacts to wastewater
treatment facilities is "significant and unavoidable." (Draft EIR, 5-41.)

6 145. The EIR improperly assumes that Patterson has committed itself to expand the

7 WQCF beyond the currently planned Phase III expansion. Given Patterson's growth projections,

8 further WQCF expansions will be required to accommodate wastewater flows from both the

9 Project, the Project's growth, inducing impacts, and other planned developments. Patterson has not

10 committed itself to expand the capacity of its WQCF in an amount sufficient to accommodate the
11 Project and its growth inducing impacts.

12 146. The Draft EIR skirts the issue of committing to enforceable mitigation measures
13 for wastewater treatment to address the necessary additional WQCF capacity to serve the Project

14 and any growth it induces. The EIR must analyze additional treatment alternatives and commit

15 itself to enforceable mitigation measures. It fails to do so.

16 5. Water Supply

17 147. The Draft EIR states that "the County is unable to determine whether changes in

18 agricultural practices and development in the Westside Area [including Patterson] would increase

19 water demand and reduce groundwater recharge so that supplies become unsustainable." (Draft

20 EIR 5-38.) Then the County goes onto to assume that there "could be a significant cumulative

21 impact" based on "the magnitude of the development" but offers no additional mitigation for those

22 impacts. (Id.)

23 148. While the County offers no additional mitigation for the significant cumulative

24 impact on water supply from the Project, the Draft EIR identifies the Sustainable Groundwater

25 Management Act's requirement to prepare a Groundwater Sustainability Plan ("GSP") as a method

26 to address the identified impact. No GSP has yet been developed or adopted. The County can
27 mitigate the impact on water supply by developing and adopting a groundwater monitoring

28 program before the GSP for the basin is adopted in 2020.

{CW071131.8} 32
Churchwell White + Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

6. Air Quality

2 149. The EIR analyzed air quality impacts from the Project's construction and

3 operational emissions, with operational emissions focused on vehicle trips from "employees,

4 visitors, and goods movement." (Draft EIR, 3.2-28.)

5 150. The EIR does not analyze the cumulative air quality impacts from the Project, the

6 Project's growth inducing impacts, and buildout of Patterson's General Plan. By failing to also
analyze air quality related to the Project's growth inducing impacts, the EIR understates and
underestimates the impact the Project will have on air quality.

9 7. Greenhouse Gas Emissions

10 151. The Draft EIR analyzes greenhouse gas emissions from construction-related

11 emissions and operational emissions. (Draft EIR, 3.7-16-17.) The cumulative impact analysis for

12 greenhouse gas emissions is four (4) sentences long. It concludes that the cumulative greenhouse

13 gas emissions is "cumulatively considerable" and that the impact is "significant and unavoidable."

14 (Draft EIR, 5-14.)

15 152. The EIR does not analyze the cumulative greenhouse gas emissions from the

16 Project, the Project's growth inducing impacts, and buildout of Patterson's General Plan. By

17 failing to also analyze greenhouse gas emissions related to the Project's growth inducing impacts,

18 the EIR grossly understates and underestimates the impact the Project will have on greenhouse gas

19 emissions.

20 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION
Abuse of Discretion - Water Supply Assessment Improperly Approved
21 (Violation of Water Code § 10910 et seq.)

22 153. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein, as if set forth in full, each and every
23 allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 152.

24 154. The County fails to rely on the information contained in the Water Supply
25 Assessment that was prepared in 2016 by AECOM and fails to include that study in the Final EIR

26 for the Project. Instead, the County relies on the Groundwater Resources Impact Assessment

27 Report and the Water Supply (Potable & Non-Potable) Infrastructure and Facilities Study, both

28 prepared in 2016, to justify its water supply findings in the EIR.

{CW071131.8} 33
Churchwell White Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

155. These studies do not provide the requisite information for the Water Supply

2 Assessment required under Water Code section 10910.

3 156. The Water Supply Assessment also fails to meet the requirements under Water

4 Code section 10910 et seq., including its analysis of alternative surface water supply options and

5 its evaluation of the Project's groundwater demand. (Water Supply Assessment, 2-8--2-9; 3-2--3-

6 5.)

157. The demand analysis does not account for the increase in population as a

8 consequence of the Project. Consequently, demand from the Project is understated. The

9 understated demand makes the water supply reliability analysis faulty.

10 158. With the uncertainty in the reliability of groundwater to meet the Project's demand,

11 the alternative analysis of surface supply is cursory and inadequate under Water Code section

12 10910.

13 159. The County abused its discretion and failed to act in the manner required by law in

14 allegedly approving the Water Supply Assessment.

15 PRAYER

16 Wherefore, Petitioner request the following relief and entry of judgment as follows:

17 1. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing:

18 a. Respondents County and Board to vacate and set aside their October 30, 2018,

19 certification of the EIR, and their December 4, 2018, approval of the Specific
20 Plan, General Plan Amendment, and Rezone Application No. PLN2013-0091;

21 and to withdraw their October 30 and December 4, 2018, Notices of

22 Determination; and

23 b. Respondent ALUC to vacate and set aside its November 15, 2018, approval of
24 Airport Land Use Commission Application No. PLN2013-0091; and to

25 withdraw its November 19, 2018, Notice of Determination.

26 2. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing the Respondents to

27 comply with CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, and to take any other action required by Public

28 Resources Code section 21168.9, or as otherwise required by law;

4n 23 Petitioner City of Patterson ("Patterson," "City" or "Petitioner") petitions this Court for a
24 writ of mandate, directed to Respondents County of Stanislaus ("County"), the Stanislaus County ErZP Lr 1 25 Board of Supervisors ("Board"), and the Stanislaus County Airport Land Use Commission
26 ("ALUC") (collectively, "Respondents"). Petitioner challenges the County Board's October 30,
27 2018, certification of the Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the Crows Landing Industrial
28 Business Park Specific Plan ("Specific Plan"), and the ALUC's November 15, 2018, approval of
(CW070799.1)
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Churchwell White !o

1 Airport Land Use Commission Application No. PLN 2013-0091 to amend the Stanislaus County

2 Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan (collectively, the "Project").

3 The Project approvals are intended to facilitate development of the Crows Landing

4 Industrial Business Park, through which the County intends to develop logistics/distribution, light

5 industrial, business park and general aviation uses, along with associated public infrastructure, on

6 property owned by the County. Located along the Highway 5 corridor, the Specific Plan proposes

7 to develop approximately 1,274 acres out of an available 1,528 acres, to create approximately

8 15,000 new jobs onsite. Through the Specific Plan, the County intends to provide sufficient site

9 infrastructure, improvements and services to enable "shovel-ready" development opportunities.

10 Amid these lofty goals, however, the Project would rely on the surrounding cities of Patterson and

11 Newman to meet Project needs for housing, sewer service, water supply, and other essential public

12 services.

13 As a responsible agency under the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources

14 Code section 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"), Patterson has consistently voiced concerns to the County

15 regarding the Project. Unfortunately, Patterson's initial comment letter in 2014 raised several

16 salient concerns under CEQA that remain unaddressed to this day: the County must properly

17 analyze and mitigate significant, growth-inducing impacts of the Project, along with significant

18 impacts of the Project to City water supplies, wastewater collection and sewer services, and

19 roadways. Rather than address these and other concerns, however, the County rushed to certify a

20 final EIR for the Project on October 30, 2018, only ten days after its publication, and after the

21 release of more than 1,500 pages of new information and technical studies that were appended to

22 the EIR and Specific Plan on October 19, 2018. In the haste to promote job-creation, the County

23 ultimately certified an EIR that fails to meet the basic and mandatory requirements of

24 environmental review under CEQA.

25 For Patterson, the most troubling concerns regarding the EIR are that it improperly
26 analyzed, and failed to implement, feasible mitigation measures that are legally required under

27 CEQA to address long-term impacts to regional hydrology and water supply, City utilities and

28 public services, and local traffic and transportation networks.

{CW070799.1} 2
Churchwell White > Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

In addition, throughout its analysis, the EIR relies on faulty assumption that the

2 surrounding cities of Patterson and Newman have already planned for and taken into account the

3 massive amount of growth that would be needed to support the Project. However, just the opposite

4 is true. Local communities, including Patterson and Newman, have planned for future growth over

5 the next 20-30 years without evaluating or considering the additional, growth-inducing impacts

6 that the Project could create. The EIR therefore is unsupported by substantial evidence where it

7 relies on studies and reports, such as the Stanislaus County Council of Governments ("StanCOG")

8 Regional Housing Needs Assessment, which do not include the Project in their growth

9 assumptions or forecasts.

10 As a result of the EIR's flawed analysis and failure to implement feasible mitigation,

11 Respondents abused their discretion by certifying an invalid EIR on October 30, 2018, and by

12 improperly relying on the EIR when adopting the Project approvals on November 15, 2018.

13 Petitioner alleges as follows:

14 PARTIES

15 1. Patterson is a California municipal corporation, located in Stanislaus County, with

16 a population of approximately 22,000 people. Patterson is a general law city governed by the laws

17 of the State of California. The Project is located approximately 1.5 miles south of Patterson city

18 limits and Patterson's Urban Services Boundary/Sphere of Influence.

19 2. Patterson is a responsible agency under CEQA, as the Project proposes to utilize

20 Patterson's wastewater treatment facility as the preferred option for processing future wastewater

21 flows from the Project site, and Patterson has not yet approved or agreed to accept wastewater

22 flows from the Project.

23 3. Respondent County of Stanislaus is a political subdivision of the State of

24 California. Respondent County of Stanislaus is the CEQA lead agency for the Project. As lead

25 agency, the County is responsible for environmental review of the Project, which requires

26 thorough analysis of the potential environmental impacts and, if necessary, implementation of

27 mitigation measures or Project alternatives to minimize significant environmental impacts.

Churchwell White Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 4. Respondent Stanislaus County Board of Supervisors is a legislative body duly

2 authorized under the California Constitution and the laws of the State of California to act on behalf

3 of the County of Stanislaus. The County Board is responsible for regulating and controlling land

4 use within the County, including, but not limited to, implementing and complying with the

5 provisions of CEQA and its implementing regulations codified in the California Code of

6 Regulations, title 14, section 15000 et seq. ("CEQA Guidelines"). As the elected representatives of

7 the people of the County, the Board establishes County priorities and sets policy. The Board is the

8 governing body of the County and is ultimately responsible for certifying a valid EIR, reviewing

9 the Project, and approving or denying the Specific Plan based on the required findings under

10 CEQA.

11 5. Respondent ALUC is a political subdivision of the State of California. The ALUC

12 is the agency responsible for preparing the Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan ("ALUCP") for

13 each public-use airport in the County, as required by the California State Aeronautics Act (Pub.

14 Util. Code, §§ 21670 et seq.). The purpose of the ALUCP is to promote compatibility between a
15 public-use airport and land uses in its vicinity. To accomplish this, the ALUCP establishes a set of

16 compatibility criteria that the ALUC uses to evaluate the compatibility of land use and airport

17 proposals within the ALUC-established airport influence area. Respondent ALUC is responsible

18 agency for the Project because the Project requires the ALUC's approval to amend the Stanislaus

19 County ALUCP. The ALUC approved the Stanislaus County ALUCP amendment on November

20 15, 2018.

21 6. Petitioner is informed and believes that there are no real parties in interest to the

22 petition because the County is the Project proponent.

23 7. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and identities of DOES 1 through 20, 1

24 inclusive, and sues such unnamed Respondents by their fictitious names. Petitioner is informed and

25 believes, and based thereon alleges, that fictitiously named Respondents are also responsible for all

26 acts and omissions described herein. When the true identities and capacities of Respondents have

27 been determined, Petitioner will, with leave of the Court if necessary, amend this Petition to

28 include such Respondents and capacities.

1 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2 8. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to

3 Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, and Public Resources Code section 21168. In the

4 alternative, this Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to Code of

5 Civil Procedure section 1085, and Public Resources Code section 21168.5.

6 9. Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the State of California

7 in and for the County of Stanislaus pursuant to sections 393, 394, and 395 of the Code of Civil

8 Procedure.

BACKGROUND FACTS

10 10. The Project site is located in the unincorporated area of western Stanislaus County,

11 approximately 1.5 miles east of Interstate Highway 5 ("I-5"), 1.5 miles south of Patterson and 7.5

12 miles north of the City of Newman. The 1,528-acre property is bounded by West Marshall Road to

13 the north, State Route 33 to the northeast, Bell Road to the east, Fink Road to the south, and Davis

14 Road and agricultural land to the west. The Project site is generally surrounded by agricultural land

15 uses, with some residences in the vicinity, and the unincorporated community of Crows Landing is

16 located approximately 1.4 miles to the east. The Delta-Mendota Canal traverses the Project site in
17 a northwest-to-southeast direction. Regional access to the Project site would be provided by I-5

18 and State Route 33 (Highway 33), with local access provided by West Marshall Road at the site's

19 northern boundary and Ike Crow Road at its eastern boundary. Sperry Avenue and Fink Road

20 would provide access between the Project site and I-5.

21 11. From 1942 to 1999, the Project site was developed and used by the federal

22 government to support the missions of the United States Navy and Coast Guard as the Crows

23 Landing Naval Auxiliary Landing Field, and subsequently the National Aeronautics and Space

24 Administration (NASA") as the NASA Crows Landing Airport.

25 12. On or about October 27, 1999, Congress passed Public Law 106-82, which

26 directed NASA to convey the former military property to the County of Stanislaus.

27 13. On or about October 12, 2004, the Board accepted conveyance of the Project site

28 pursuant to Public Law 106-82.

(CW070799.1) 5
Churchwell White Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

14. Since acquiring title to the property, the County has contemplated various

2 proposals for the industrial reuse of the site. Previous proposals included a plan to connect the site
by rail to the Port of Oakland.

4 15. In 2008, voters in Stanislaus County approved "Measure E," a "30-Year Land Use
Restriction Initiative." Measure E requires ballot approval by a majority of county voters prior to

6 the County Board approving any zone change to facilitate housing in agricultural zones in the

7 County. As a result, residential development in the unincorporated areas of the County will be
significantly more difficult throughout the duration of Measure E.

16. The County has proceeded with the current iteration of the Project since at least

10 2012, when the County issued request for proposals, seeking a master developer partner to

11 develop the Crows Landing Industrial Business Park. To Patterson's knowledge, however, no

12 master developer was selected or is currently associated with the Project. As a result, there are no

13 real parties in interest in this case and the County therefore is the lead Project proponent and the

14 lead agency under CEQA.

15 17. The Specific Plan identifies various land uses, including Aviation, Aviation-

16 compatible, Multimodal Access/Greenspace/Monument, Public Facilities, Logistics, Industrial,

17 and Business Park. These uses would be developed in three 10-year phases (i.e., 30 years) to

18 provide site development for approximately 14,000 to 15,000 jobs at full build-out. At full build-

19 out, the EIR estimated a total population of approximately 34,270 that would be directly related to

20 the jobs created by the Project.

21 18. On or about October 13, 2014, Respondents issued a notice of preparation

22 ("NOP") for the Project. The NOP comment period provided the first opportunity for Patterson to

23 submit formal comments as a responsible agency under CEQA regarding the Project.

24 19. On November 13, 2014, Patterson submitted a comment letter to Respondents on

25 the NOP. Patterson's comment letter stressed the need of the Draft EIR to fully analyze hydrology

26 and water quality; population and housing; public municipal services; parks, recreation, and open

27 spaces; transportation and traffic; utilities and service systems; cumulative impacts; and growth

28

(CW070799.1} 6

Churchwell White Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 inducing impacts. In particular, Patterson comments expressed concern that the EIR failed to

2 properly analyze the Project's cumulative impacts with other local planned development.

3 20. In March 2015, Patterson learned that the County was in discussions with Western

4 Hills Water District ("WHWD") to convey wastewater flows generated by the Project to WHWD,

5 which has an agreement in place with Patterson to convey residential flows to Patterson's

6 wastewater treatment facility. By conveying the Project's wastewater flows to WHWD, the County

7 was seeking to ultimately connect to Patterson's wastewater treatment facility without negotiating

8 directly with Patterson for the Project's fair-share costs of the necessary treatment capacity and

9 conveyance infrastructure to serve the Project.

10 21. Between 2015 and 2017, City and County staff met on numerous occasions in an

11 attempt to establish a more transparent process regarding the County's objectives for the Project.

12 After reviewing administrative drafts of the Specific Plan and EIR, Patterson staff determined that

13 the EIR was severely deficient, specifically with regard to its analysis of impacts on Patterson's

14 wastewater system and roadway network. During these meetings, Patterson staff raised concerns

15 regarding the need to expand its wastewater facility to serve the Project, plus the lack of housing
16 inventory in Patterson to meet the demand that would be created by the Project.

17 22. In June 2017, the County agreed to reimburse Patterson for costs associated with

18 conducting a peer-review of the EIR and Specific Plan. Patterson engaged Black Water Consulting

19 Engineers, Inc. ("Black Water") to conduct a peer-review of the wastewater analysis in the

20 Specific Plan, and Stantec Consulting Services, Inc. ("Stantec") to conduct a peer-review of traffic

21 and transportation impacts of the Project on City roadways.

22 23. On or about January 22, 2018, Respondents issued a notice of availability of the

23 draft EIR ("Draft EIR").

24 24. On or about April 26, 2018, Patterson, by and through its counsel of record,

25 submitted a comment letter in response to the Draft EIR, outlining several issues with the Draft

26 EIR and its analysis, including wastewater collection, conveyance, and treatment facilities; traffic

27 and transportation; population, housing, and employment; hydrology and water quality; public

28 services; project description; and cumulative impacts. Patterson's comment letter emphasized that

{CW070799.1) 7
Churchwell White Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 the Draft EIR failed to address concerns previously raised by the City and its technical consultants

2 regarding Project impacts on City services that are already at or near maximum capacity, including

3 wastewater treatment, water supply, local roadways, and housing. The comment letter also noted

4 that the EIR failed to properly analyze alternatives to the Project, including alternatives for treating

5 Project wastewater in the event Patterson would not or could not accept Project flows. The

6 comment letter further noted defects in the EIR's cumulative analysis of the Project, along with a

7 failure to mitigate impacts to several Patterson intersections that would degrade to unacceptable

8 levels of service.

9 25. On or about October 19, 2018, Respondents published the Final EIR, eight

10 appendices to the Final EIR, and a revised Specific Plan with numerous new appendices, totaling

11 more than 1,500 pages. On the same day, the County issued a notice of public hearing for the

12 Board to consider certification of the Final EIR on October 30, 2018.

13 26. On October 29, 2018, Patterson, by and through its counsel of record, submitted a

14 comment letter to Respondent Board of Supervisors outlining key issues with the EIR and its

15 analysis. On October 30, 2018, Patterson, by and through its legal counsel, submitted a

16 supplemental comment letter to the Board. These comment letters noted that the Final EIR did not

17 adequately respond to comments to the Draft EIR, and that the Final EIR contained significant new

18 information regarding Project impacts to groundwater that were previously not analyzed in the

19 Draft EIR.

20 27. On October 30, 2018, Respondent Board of Supervisors held a public meeting to

21 consider certification of the Final EIR, which the Board unanimously approved.

22 28. On October 30, 2018, Respondents filed a notice of determination ("NOD") with

23 the Stanislaus County Clerk. Respondents filed the NOD prior to approving the Specific Plan or

24 any other land use entitlements related to the Project.

25 29. On November 6, 2018, Respondents issued public notices for the Stanislaus

26 County Planning Commission and ALUC to consider recommending to the Board of Supervisors

27 approval of the necessary Project entitlements, including the Specific Plan, General Plan

28

(CW070799.1)
Churchwell White Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 Amendment, Rezone Application No. PLN2013-0091, and final approval of Airport Land Use

2 Commission Application No. PLN2013-0091, at a meeting on November 15, 2018.

3 30. On November 14, 2018, Petitioner submitted comment letters to the Stanislaus

4 County Planning Commission and ALUC raising objections to the Project entitlements including

5 deficiencies of the EIR. Petitioner's comment letter also urged the County to enter into a

6 memorandum of understanding, to coordinate Patterson's timely delivery of wastewater services as

7 a responsible agency for the Project, and to establish a pre-annexation agreement to extend

8 Patterson city limits in order to accommodate new residential development that would be needed

9 to accommodate future needs of projects within the City of Patterson and the County's Specific

10 Plan.

11 31. On November 15, 2018, the Stanislaus County Planning Commission and ALUC

12 held a public meeting to consider the Project entitlements, including the Specific Plan, General

13 Plan Amendment, Rezone Application No. PLN2013-0091, and Airport Land Use Commission

14 Application No. PLN2013-0091.

15 32. On November 15, the ALUC approved Airport Land Use Commission Application

16 No. PLN2013-0091 for the adoption of the Stanislaus County Airport Land Use Compatibility

17 Plan amendment.

18 33. On November 19, 2018, Respondents filed a second NOD following the ALUC's

19 adoption of the Stanislaus County Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan amendment.

20 34. On December 4, 2018, Respondent Board of Supervisors are scheduled to hold a

21 public meeting to consider approval of the Project entitlements, including the Specific Plan,

22 General Plan Amendment, and Rezone Application No. PLN2013-0091.

23 35. Patterson brings this action to challenge the County's certification of the EIR for

24 the Specific Plan, on the basis that the County violated CEQA by certifying an invalid EIR, and
25 approving legally defective CEQA findings, prior to taking final action to approve the Project.

Churchwell White Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES AND INADEQUACY OF REMEDY

2 36. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant

3 action and has exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by

4 law.

5 37. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

6 21167.5 by mailing written notice of this action to the Respondents. A copy of this written notice

7 and proof of service are attached hereto as Exhibit A.

8 38. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.6 by
9 concurrently filing; request concerning preparation of the record of administrative proceedings
10 relating to this action.

11 39. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
12 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside their

13 certification of the EIR. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' approval will remain in

14 effect in violation of State law.

15 40. This action has been brought within 30 days of the filing of the NOD as required

16 by Public Resources Codes section 21167, subdivision (c). Respondents filed the first NOD on the
17 certification of the EIR with the County Clerk on October 30, 2018, even though no action was

18 taken relative to Project approval. Petitioner contends the October 30, 2018, NOD is defective but
19 is filing this Petition within thirty days of the posting of the first NOD. Respondents filed a second
20 NOD on November 19, 2018, after the ALUC's adoption of an amendment to the Stanislaus

21 County ALUCP on November 15, 2018.

22 STANDING

23 41. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because

24 Petitioners' municipal services, public facilities, and transportation and traffic infrastructure will

25 be directly and adversely affected by Respondents' certification of the EIR and approval of the

26 Project. Further, Petitioner is a responsible agency under CEQA for the Project.

ARBITRARY AND CAPRICOUS ACTIONS

2 42. Petitioner brings this action on the basis, among others, of Government Code
section 800, and other applicable laws, which awards Petitioner attorneys' fees in actions to
overturn agency decisions that are arbitrary and capricious, such as the decisions in question herein.

5 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE

43. Petitioners bring this action as a private attorney general pursuant to Code of Civil
7 Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important rights
8 affecting the public. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a significant benefit
9 on a large class of persons by ensuring that Respondents do not certify an EIR, approve a Project,
10 and illegally expend public funds in the absence of lawful environmental review.
11 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

12 Abuse of Discretion - - Mitigation Measures Are Not Enforceable As Required By CEQA (Violation of CEQA, Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21000 et seq.)
13 44. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein, as if set forth in full, each and every
14 allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 43.
15 45. In certifying the EIR and approving the Project as described herein, Respondent
16 prejudicially abused its discretion in violation of CEQA pursuant to Public Resources Code section
17 21168 and Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5. Respondents certified an EIR that fails to
18 include necessary information for informed decision making and informed public participation,
19 including necessary information to reach informed conclusions regarding the significance of the
20 Project's environmental impacts, the effectiveness of mitigation measures to avoid the Project's
21 significant environmental impacts, or feasibility of mitigation measures to reduce the Project's
22 significant environmental impacts; because the EIR fails to lawfully assess the cumulative effects;
23 because the EIR fails to use the best available information and/or accepted methodology for
24 analyzing information; because the EIR fails to provide good faith responses to comments on the
25 Draft EIR; because, with respect to the findings required by CEQA, Respondents failed to make
26 required findings, failed to support the findings with substantial evidence, and failed to disclose the
27 analytic route showing how the evidence supports the findings; and because the EIR impermissibly
28 defers analysis of impacts and development of mitigation measures to the future.

(CW070799.1} 11
Churchwell White Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

46. Petitioner alleges that Respondents violated CEQA as detailed in a number of

2 comment letters submitted by Petitioner and others during the administrative review process,

3 including, without limitation, the comment letters to Respondents by counsel for Petitioner.

4 Petitioner intends to prosecute all of the alleged violations of CEQA described herein and in the

5 documents and comments submitted to Respondents during the administrative review process. By

6 way of illustration, and without limitation, Petitioner alleges the following violations of CEQA by
the County:
A. The EIR Lacks Enforceable Mitigation Measures for Impacts to Groundwater

9 Resources.

10 47. The EIR relies upon Groundwater Resources Impact Assessment, dated October

11 31, 2016, and prepared by Jacobson James & Associates, Inc. to evaluate and address the impacts

12 to groundwater resources from the Project. (Draft EIR, 3.10-28.)

13 48. The Groundwater Resources Impact Assessment provides four mitigation measures

14 to address the Project's impact to groundwater resources, including: (1) subsidence monitoring at

15 three locations on the Project site; (2) setbacks for shallow wells of at least 250 feet; (3)

16 groundwater level monitoring; and (4) a requirement that Project applicants prepare a plan to fully

17 offset any drawdown from the shallow groundwater aquifer underlying the Project site through

18 recharge. (Jacobson James & Associates, Groundwater Resources Impact Assessment, 5-5-5-7.)

19 49. The EIR incorporates the first three mitigation measures provided in the

20 Groundwater Resources Impact Assessment as Mitigation Measures 3.10-4a, 3.10-4b, and 3.10-4f,

21 but fails to include an enforceable mitigation measure that addresses the plan for drawdown from

22 the Project from the shallow portion of the groundwater aquifer underlying the Project site.

23 50. Instead, the EIR relies on the Project's Specific Plan Water Policy WP 4, "a dual-

24 purpose stormwater pond in the northeastern portion of the project site," and performance and

25 design standards to address drawdown and recharge from the Project in the shallow aquifer

26 underlying the Project site that will be used for the Project's non-potable water supply. (Draft EIR,

27 3.10-43.) Relying upon these standards, the EIR alleges that the Project will not "result in any net

28 increase in groundwater demand from the shallow aquifer" despite the Groundwater Resources

(CW070799.1) 12
Churchwell White Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 Impact Assessment's finding that a plan to address drawdown from the shallow aquifer underlying

2 the Project through recharge is required. (Draft EIR, 3.10-43.)

3 51. The EIR states that the Project will induce drawdown in the tens of feet in the
4 confined aquifer that will be used for the Project's potable water supply. (Final EIR 2.3.6-69;

5 Draft EIR 3.10-43, Groundwater Resources Impact Assessment, 5-3.) The confined aquifer

6 underlies the Project site but is located beneath the shallow aquifer and separated from it by a layer

7 of Corcoran Clay. The Project is located in a critically over drafted basin and the identified

8 drawdown will contribute to additional overdraft, directly, and cumulatively.

9 52. Despite this, the EIR makes no finding of a significant impact from this drawdown,

10 offers no mitigation for the impact, and makes no finding of overriding consideration to approve
11 the Project. Additionally, there is no real analysis of any alternative water supply sources beyond

12 groundwater to avoid the drawdown impact.

13 53. The EIR also impermissibly delays implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.10-4b,

14 a groundwater level monitoring program, until the Groundwater Sustainability Plan ("GSP")

15 required under the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act is implemented. There is no clear

16 plan in place through Mitigation Measure 3.10-4b to address any reduction to groundwater levels
17| from the Project through this proposed mitigation measure because no groundwater monitoring
18 program has yet been developed or adopted through a GSP.

19 54. By failing to adopt the identified mitigation measure in the EIR, not addressing the

20 drawdown in the confined aquifer, and delaying adoption of a groundwater monitoring program
21 until the GSP is adopted, the Respondents have prejudicially abused their discretion by certifying

22 the EIR and approving the Project when it has it not committed to enforceable mitigation measures

23 to address identified significant groundwater impacts of the Project.

24 B. The EIR Lacks Commitment to Enforceable Traffic Mitigations Measures.

25 55. The Draft EIR states that the Project will generate additional traffic and degrade

26 levels of service ("LOS") at several intersections. (Draft EIR, 3.14-15.) To address these

27 significant impacts, the EIR provides several mitigation measures. For instance, at the intersection

28 of Sperry Avenue and Highway 33, the EIR states that signalization will improve the LOS D or

(CW070799.1) 13
Churchwell White Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 better. (Draft EIR, 3.14-15.) "However, the County cannot guarantee that this improvement would

2 be implemented since this would be under the jurisdiction of the City of Patterson." (Ibid.) Further,

3 the Final EIR acknowledges that Patterson will have to implement transportation and traffic
4 improvements within Patterson's jurisdiction to mitigate for the Project's impacts. (Final EIR,

5 2.3.6-48, 2.3.6-49.) These improvements may include signalization and lane widening. (Ibid.)

6 56. Appendix F of the EIR, the Transportation Infrastructure Plan, provides several

7 enforceable recommendations for mitigating the Project's impacts on traffic and transportation.

8 These recommendations include: establishment of a comprehensive strategy to reduce solo

9 occupant vehicle travel by employees, business vehicles including trucks, and visitors; establishing

10 designated transportation demand management organization that requires mandatory

11 involvement by all companies within the Project and assigning a person representing the Project on

12 an ongoing basis to coordinate with individual businesses; requiring each individual business

13 within the Project to establish a designated transportation demand management company

14 representative; requiring the transportation demand management organization to include annual

15 mandatory employee surveys with a required response rate of at least 90 percent of employees; and

16 requiring the transportation demand management company to prepare an annual report indicating

17 status of compliance with transportation demand management goals established by the County.

18 (Appendix F, 41-42.)

19 57. Respondents cannot abdicate their responsibility to analyze and mitigate

20 significant impacts because certain intersections are outside their jurisdiction. Respondents must

21 commit to enforceable mitigation measures, especially where they are identified in reports

22 prepared for the Specific Plan.
23 58. As mitigation measure, the Final EIR focuses on the County directing
24 leaseholders, developers, and contractors to reimburse Patterson for its fair-share of costs for off-

25 site transportation and traffic improvements and implementation of mitigation measures. (Final

26 EIR, 2.3.6-48, 2.3.6-49.)

27 59. However, the EIR does not require nor does it impose an enforceable mechanism

28 for leaseholders, developers, and contractors to pay their fair-share of transportation and traffic

{CW070799.1) 14
Churchwell White Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

: improvement costs to Patterson. The EIR merely states that Respondents will facilitate the transfer

2 of fair-share costs. Agreeing to facilitate the transfer of funds is not the same as a binding
3l commitment. The EIR may not rely on future mitigation measures such as these that are vague and
4  unenforceable. In addition, the EIR fails to implement enforceable mitigation measures

5 recommended in the Transportation Infrastructure Plan.

6 60. Respondents have prejudicially abused their discretion by certifying the EIR and
7 approving a Project that has failed to impose enforceable mitigation measures, and failed to

8 incorporate measures proposed by the Project's own appendices to the Specific Plan.

9 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

10 Abuse of Discretion - The EIR Contains an Inaccurate Project Description (Violation of CEQA, Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21000 et seq.)

11 61. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein, as if set forth in full, each and every

12 allegation contained in paragraphs through 60.

13 62. The EIR project description fails to identify approvals for the Project that would be
14 needed from Stanislaus County Local Agency Formation Commission ("LAFCO") in order for

15 Patterson's WQCF to provide wastewater treatment, namely approval of an out-of-boundary
16 service agreement or establishing Patterson's WQCF as a regional facility.

17 63. In order to serve the Project, LAFCO must approve an out of boundary service

18 agreement, or alternative steps must be taken to establish the WQCF as a regional facility.

19 64. The EIR identifies LAFCO's role in the Project as approving a Community

20 Service Area to manage the provision of services and maintenance of infrastructure for the

21 Specific Plan Area.

22 65. CEQA requires that the full level of development and use being authorized by an

23 approval must be analyzed and its effect mitigated. The EIR fails to meet this standard.

24 66. The inclusion of a clear and comprehensive description of the Project is critical to

25 an EIR's accurate analysis of impacts and meaningful public review. The EIR failed to meet this

26 requirement.

27 67. The EIR project description is misleading and therefore the Board's certification of

28 the EIR constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion where the EIR failed to accurately portray the

{CW070799.1) 15
Churchwell White Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 required steps for Patterson's WQCF to serve the Project, and especially where the required steps

2 would result in significant, new growth-inducing and cumulative impacts.
m THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
Abuse of Discretion - Significant New Information Required Recirculation of the EIR
(Violation of CEQA, Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21000 et seq.)
68. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein, as if set forth in full, each and every
allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 67.

7 69. In the Draft EIR, the discussion of growth inducing impacts is very short,

8 approximately one-page long. The Draft EIR discusses how the Project's approximately 14,000 to

9 15,000 jobs will lead to additional housing demand in the County and region. (Draft EIR, 5-43.)

10 However, the Draft EIR does not discuss where the additional housing demand may be located and

11 whether there is enough additional housing to in the area to accommodate the job growth and
12 accompanying population growth.

13 70. The Final EIR estimates that 15,000 employees would generate a population of

14 approximately 34,270. (Final EIR, 2.2-5.) Assuming the County's current average household size,

15 11,200 new housing units would be needed to house the expected population growth. (Final EIR,

16 2.2-5.) The EIR proposes that the increased population growth is likely to locate in Newman,

17 Patterson, Turlock, and the County-wide unincorporated area. (Final EIR, 2.2-5.) The EIR states

18 that Newman, Patterson, Turlock, and the County-wide unincorporated area will develop enough

19 housing to fully accommodate the increased population growth. (Final EIR, 2.2-5.)

20 71. The EIR added significant new information regarding the Project's growth

21 inducing impacts, where that population growth may locate, and whether those areas have housing

22 capacity to accommodate that growth.

23 72. The addition of significant new information without recirculating the EIR deprived

24 the public of a meaningful opportunity to comment on substantial adverse project impacts, feasible

25 mitigation measures, or alternatives before certification of the EIR.

26 73. In particular, as discussed further below, Patterson will be substantially harmed by

27 the Project's growth inducing impacts because Patterson is the closest incorporated city to the

28 Project. A significant portion of the Project's growth inducing impacts is likely to locate in

{CW070799.1) 16
Churchwell White Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 Patterson and Newman, including population growth and housing. Thus, Patterson and Newman

2 were wholly deprived of any meaningful opportunity to comment on how the Project's growth

3 inducing impacts will directly affect them because the Draft EIR did not include this information.
4 74. By failing to recirculate the EIR for additional comments based on the significant

5 new information added to the EIR, Respondents have prejudicially abused their discretion in

6 certifying the EIR and approving the Project.

7 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

8 Abuse of Discretion - The EIR's Impact Analysis Is Insufficient (Violation of CEQA, Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21000 et seq.)

9 75. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein, as if set forth in full, each and every

10 allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 74.

11 76. Allegations in this Petition regarding the failure of the EIR to adequately analyze
12 impacts includes the conclusion that the EIR improperly made various assumptions in analyzing

13 the Project's impacts. The EIR improperly assumes that local planning documents already account

14 for and accommodate the Project's growth inducing and cumulative impacts. The EIR improperly
15 assumes that most, if not all, forecasted local growth is one and the same as the Project's growth

16 inducing impacts. However, the EIR fails to recognize that local jurisdictions have projected their

17 own growth, separate and aside from the Project's growth inducing impacts and therefore these

18 other documents omitted growth inducing impacts produced by the Project. An analysis of local
19 growth and Project-induced growth, taken and reviewed together, will reveal significant
20 environmental impacts that have not been analyzed by Respondents. This flaw in the EIR's

21 analysis is revealed when individual components of the EIR are reviewed, including Project

22 induced growth; municipal services, including schools, parks, and other recreational facilities;

23 transportation and traffic; water supply; wastewater and sewer; and cumulative impacts.

24 A. Growth Induced Housing

25 77. The EIR estimates that full buildout of the Project will result in the creation of

26 14,000 to 15,000 new jobs within the Specific Plan area. (Final EIR, 2.2-4.) Since approximately

27 44 percent of the County's total population is in the labor force, the EIR estimates that 15,000

28 employees would generate a population of approximately 34,270. (Final EIR, 2.2-5.) Assuming the

{CW070799.1) 17
Churchwell White ..* Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 County's current average household size, 11,200 new housing units would be needed to house the

2 expected population growth. (Final EIR, 2.2-5.)

3 78. One of the overarching Project objectives is to develop high-quality employment

4 opportunities within the County. The EIR must analyze the Project consistent with its objectives.

5 79. Patterson and Newman are the only two incorporated cities on the west side of

6 Stanislaus County. Each city is located near to the Project. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that

7 most of the Project's employees will relocate in Patterson or Newman, especially in light of the

8 Measure E development restrictions on unincorporated parts of the County.

80. Patterson currently has a population of approximately 22,100. The City of

10 Newman currently has a population of approximately 11,300. Together Patterson and Newman

11 have an approximate population of 33,400. A population increase of 34,270 would more than

12 double the current populations of Patterson and Newman alone. While the EIR, without substantial

13 evidence to support this assumption, anticipates that population growth will be spread between

14 Patterson, Newman, Turlock, and unincorporated area, Patterson and Newman will likely absorb a

15 majority of the growth because they are the two closest incorporated cities to the Project.

16 81. The EIR then relies on County planning documents to state that the local
17 community sufficiently projects enough additional housing to accommodate for the Project's

18 induced housing needs. (Final EIR, 2.2-5.) Specifically, the Final EIR relies on the 2014 Regional

19 Transportation Plan and the Sustainable Communities Strategy's ("RTP/SCS") and 2014-2023

20 Stanislaus Council of Governments ("StanCOG") Regional Housing Needs Plan ("RHNA").
21 82. The Final EIR cites the RTP/SCS forecast that 16,000 additional housing units will

22 be built in the Patterson, Newman, and County-wide unincorporated area between 2020 and 2040.

23 (Final EIR, 2.2-5.) The Final EIR also cites the StanCOG RHNA to extrapolate data regarding how

24 many housing units will be built in the area during the Project's buildout.' (Final EIR, 2.2-5.)

25

26 is 1 The StanCOG RHNA is based on a 10-year timeframe. However, the Final EIR uses the StanCOG RHNA numbers to calculate the number of housing units that will be built over 20-years. The StanCOG RHNA numbers do not
27 represent the best available methodology to calculate expected housing buildout over 20 years. Further, in this portion
of the Final EIR, it discusses the Project's buildout over a span of 20 years. However, the Draft EIR specifically

28 states that the Project is estimated to be built in three 10-year phases, over 30 years. The Project description is not consistent.

{CW070799.1) 18
Churchwell White.• Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 Based on this questionable methodology, the Final EIR estimates that 18,256 housing units will be

2 built between 2020 to 2040 in Newman, Patterson, Turlock, and the County-wide unincorporated

3 area. (Final EIR, 2.2-5.) Thus, the EIR concludes that the local community "will be planning for
housing in excess of what would be necessary to house employees of the Specific Plan Area."

5 (Final EIR, 2.2-5.)

83. However, the RTP/SCS and StanCOG RHNA do not contemplate the Project and

7 its potential growth inducing impacts. The Project is not even discussed in those documents. The

8 Final EIR's conclusion that sufficient housing will be available to meet the Project's growth

9 inducing impacts is not based on substantial evidence. Respondents prejudicially abused their

10 discretion by certifying the EIR,

11 84. The Final EIR's flaw in relying on the local community to accommodate its
12 growth inducing impacts is further revealed when examining planning documents for the cities of

13 Patterson and Newman.

14 85. The City of Patterson adopted its most recent general plan amendments in 2010,

15 before the current iteration of the Project was conceived.. The individual elements of the Patterson

16 General Plan and its other supporting documents do not contemplate, consider, nor accommodate

17 for the Project's growth inducing impacts, let alone mention the Project in any meaningful way.

18 86. Since the Patterson general plan does not discuss the Project, the local growth

19 projection is made without taking the Project's demand for housing into account. Thus, the EIR did

20 not analyze cumulative impacts from Patterson's projected growth together with the Project's
21 growth inducing impacts. Due to the cumulative impacts from the Project and local growth, there

22 will not be adequate housing to meet future demand in the area.

23 87. While the local community may have forecasted additional housing demand due to

24 their own projected growth, the EIR falsely assumes that these growth forecasts take into account

25 the Project's induced growth. Local planning documents do not discuss the Project, nor
26 accommodate for the Project's induced growth. Thus, there is no substantial evidence to support

27 the EIR's assumption that the local community has accounted for and will accommodate the

28 Project's growth inducing impacts.

{CW070799.1} 19
Churchwell White 3 Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

88. Further, it is an abuse of discretion for the EIR to rely on housing development in
the unincorporated areas of the County. Following the adoption of Measure E, residential

3 development in the unincorporated areas of the County are substantially more difficult to approve

4 and less likely to be developed. No substantial evidence supports the finding that the

5 unincorporated areas of the County can support housing development for the Project's growth

6 inducing impacts. Respondents' reliance on baseless assumptions in the EIR to approve the Project

7 entitlements is arbitrary and capricious.

8 B. Municipal Services

9 89. The Draft EIR incorrectly assumes that no additional schools, parks, recreational

10 facilities, or other public facilities (e.g., libraries) will be necessary because the Project does not

11 include residential development. (Draft EIR, 3.13-1, 5-28.) Further, the Draft EIR states that "[t]he

12 County has elected not to speculate as to whether there would be any population-related

13 cumulative impact related to schools, parks and recreational facilities, or other types of public

14 services and facilities to which the project could contribute." (Draft EIR, 5-29-30, emphasis in

15 original.)

16 90. The Project cannot assume that no additional schools, parks, recreational facilities,

17 and other public facilities will be necessary merely because the Project itself does not include

18 residential development. While the EIR need not speculate, it must analyze reasonably foreseeable

19 impacts.

20 91. The EIR clearly projects that the Project's growth inducing impacts will result in

21 direct population growth of 34,270 residents to the local community. A significant amount of this

22 population growth will likely be concentrated in the two nearest incorporated cities of Patterson

23 and Newman. This population growth could double the current populations of Patterson and

24 Newman.

25 92. These new residents will cause an increase in intensity of use to local schools,

26 parks, recreational facilities, and other public facilities. Existing public facilities will not be

27 sufficient to accommodate all the new residents. Additional school facilities, parks, recreational

28 facilities, and other public facilities will need to be constructed to accommodate the significant

(CW070799.1) 20
Churchwell White; Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 population increase and change in intensity of use of existing facilities.

2 93. In Stanislaus County, approximately 27.1 percent of the County is younger than 18

3 years old and thus of schooling age. Assuming the Project induced population growth will have

4 similar age characteristics, population increase of 34,270 would also increase the school age

5 population by approximately 9,287.

6 94. The Patterson Joint Unified School District has an enrollment of approximately

7 5,500 students. The Newman-Crows Landing Unified School District has an enrollment of

8 approximately 3,000 students. The Patterson Joint and Newman-Crows Landing Unified School

9 Districts have a combined enrollment of 8,500 students--less than the estimated 9,000 Project-

10 related student population growth.

11 95. If a majority the Project growth inducing student population were to attend

12 schools in Patterson Joint and Newman-Crows Landing Unified School Districts, school facilities

13 would have to effectively double. A significant amount of construction would be necessary to

14 double existing school facilities to accommodate the increased student population resulting from

15 Project-induced growth. This construction will lead to physical impacts on the environment,
16 | including, but not limited to, dust and noise from construction activities. The EIR failed to analyze
17 impacts related to building new school facilities. Further, increased traffic resulting from trips to

18 and from new school facilities was not analyzed, Project-related impacts on local schools is not

19 speculative. This is a clear a and foreseeable impact under CEQA that the EIR is required to analyze.

20 96. Similarly, the increased population is likely to increase the intensity of use of parks,

21 recreational facilities, and other public facilities. The record contains no evidence of overall usage

22 or capacity of public facilities. Moreover, the EIR makes no attempt to determine the current use
23 of schools, parks, recreational facilities, or other public facilities by existing residents or to

24 extrapolate from such data estimated increased usage by an additional 34,270 residents.

25 97. The EIR falsely assumes that the additional schools and public facilities necessary

26 to service the Project are speculative. These environmental impacts are clear and foreseeable. As
27 an information document, the EIR failed to contain sufficient information to enable Respondents to

28 properly consider the Project's environmental consequences related to schools, parks, recreational

{CW070799.1} 21
Churchwell White Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 facilities, and other public facilities. By relying on the EIR to approve the Project entitlements,

2 Respondents acted in a manner that is arbitrary and capricious, and an abuse of discretion.

3 C. Traffic

4 98. The Draft EIR analyzes the Project's traffic impacts in sections 3.14 and 5-30

5 through 5-36 and in Appendix F, Transportation Infrastructure Plan, of the Draft EIR. The EIR's

6 traffic analysis wrongly assumes that the Project's impacts to traffic are synonymous with local
7 traffic patterns. Thus, the EIR understates the Project's true impacts to traffic and transportation.

8 99. The EIR uses outdated traffic and trip data information from 2013 and 2014. Since

9 then, numerous projects in Patterson have been developed and continue to be developed, including,

10 but not limited to, large logistics center projects, gas stations, housing projects, and other

11 developments that contribute to localized traffic within Patterson and along Sperry Avenue. The

12 logistic center projects generate a high number of trips. Examples of logistics projects in Patterson

13 include the Amazon Warehouse, Restoration Hardware distribution center, and high volume

14 adjacent uses such as the Pilot Flying J trucking service center and gas station.

15 100. The Final EIR stated that the Draft EIR traffic analysis was sufficient because it

16 took into consideration buildout of Patterson's General Plan, which was adopted in 2010 and

17 updated in 2014. (Final EIR, 2.3.6-48.) However, hypothetical data generated by contemplating

18 Patterson's General Plan is not as effective as using actual, recent traffic data. The new data more

19 accurately reflects traffic conditions in Patterson for roads that will feed into the Project site.

20 Instead of relying on hypothetical models, the EIR should have used more recent, actual traffic

21 data to study the cumulative effects of the Project on local roadways. By relying on outdated data,

22 the EIR's traffic analysis severely understated traffic impacts of the Project.

23 101. Further, the Draft EIR relies upon Patterson's existing plans to expand the number

24 of lanes on Patterson roads, including Sperry Avenue. Those plans were made before the Project

25 was proposed and the Project was not considered as part of Patterson's expansion plans.

26 Consequently, it is not clear that Patterson's roadways will be sufficient to serve both Patterson's

27 and the Project's needs. No study has been done to determine if the proposed expansion will

28

(CW070799.1} 22
Churchwell White Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

2 provide the correct level of service. Thus, it is likely that further roadway improvements will be

U necessary to accommodate cumulative impacts of both the Project and growth in Patterson.

D. Water Supply
D 1.

5 102. Water Supply Assessment

6 The Project relies entirely on groundwater to provide both potable and non-potable

7 water necessary to meet Project demand. (Draft EIR, 3.10-41.) This reliance will increase overall

8 groundwater use compared to existing conditions and require three new groundwater wells to be

9 drilled, two in the deep, confined aquifer and one in the shallow unconfined aquifer underlying the

10 Project site. (Draft EIR 3.10-41.) Full buildout of the is Project is anticipated to require 2,819 acre
feet of water per year

11 and to result in 13 feet of drawdown from the deep, confined aquifer that

12 will provide the Project's potable water. (Draft EIR 3.10-43.)

103.

13 The projections included in the EIR are based on the Groundwater Resources

14 Impact Assessment prepared by Jacobson James and Associates, dated October 31, 2016. (Draft
EIR 3.10-42.) The Groundwater Resources Impact Assessment does not account for any
15 population growth that the Project will induce. (Groundwater Resources Impact Assessment, 2-2;

16

17 SB 610 Water Assessment, 3-3--3-5.)

104. While the employees and visitors to the Project are accounted for in the
18 Groundwater Resources Impact Assessment, the demand projection improperly ignores the
19 problem of supplying water to the growth in population that results from the Project. Ignoring this

20

21 additional demand means that the projected demand and drawdown included in the EIR

22 understates the groundwater resources impact of the Project.
105.

23 That understatement calls into question the Project's ability to rely on groundwater

24 as the source for all potable and non-potable water demands. With this uncertainty, there must be

25 discussion of possible replacement sources and an evaluation of the environmental impacts of

26 those replacements. The EIR lacks this analysis.

106.

27 The Water Supply Assessment required under SB 610, which was prepared by

28 AECOM and is dated in February 2016 shares this same deficiency. (SB 610 Water Assessment, 3-

Churchwell White -3-5.) The Water Supply Assessment evaluates the Project's demand for water without

{CW070799.1) 23
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 considering any growth that will result from the Project and the resulting increased demand on the

2 groundwater basin underlying the Project site. This failure means that the Water Supply

3 Assessment does not provide an accurate analysis of the amount of water the Project may need.

4 107. The understatement of the Project's demand once again calls into question the

5 ability of the basin to provide groundwater to meet the Project's need, especially where the

6 understated demand numbers already result in drawdown and the basin is already in overdraft.

7 The SB 610 Water Assessment lacks any real discussion of replacement or alternative water

8 sources, dismissing all other surface water supply options as unreliable because opportunities to

9 secure such supply are scarce.

10 2. Change in Recharge

11 108. The Project site's current use as agricultural land "represent[s] a substantial source

12 of groundwater recharge, since a significant portion of the applied irrigation water and stormwater

13 percolates through the soil to the aquifer." (Draft EIR 3.10-40.) The Draft EIR then alleges that

14 recharge will be available in an amount to offset the Project's "demand for [groundwater] in excess

15 of historical average." (Draft EIR 3.10-42.) While at the same time, the Draft EIR also

16 acknowledges that "the construction of approximately 1,000 acres of impervious surfaces would

17 reduce the amount of water available for local groundwater recharge." (Draft EIR 3.10-41.)

18 109. The ability to provide recharge that offsets the Project's demand is based on the
19 mitigation measure that was not included in the EIR: a required recharge enhancement plan "that

20 describes how the Project will achieve sufficient recharge to fully offset any additional

21 groundwater demand on the shallow aquifer imposed by the Project." (Groundwater Resources

22 Impact Assessment, 2-2.)

23 110. This analysis appears to address the reduction in recharge from the increase in

24 impervious surfaces, but upon closer inspection makes no such mitigation. Instead, the analysis

25 rejects the mitigation measure of a recharge enhancement plan and relies on other strategies such

26 as low impact development standards, a detention basin, alteration to the streambed of Little

27 Salado Creek, and landscape strategies to address recharge.

28

(CW070799.1} 24
Churchwell White• Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

111. Relying on these strategies improperly assumes that the strategies identified are

2 sufficient to address the reduction in groundwater recharge from the impervious surface without

3 ever doing a project specific analysis that would be included in a recharge enhancement plan. The

4 Groundwater Resources Impact Assessment that the EIR relies upon identifies these strategies as

5 approaches to address recharge, but specifically requires the recharge enhancement plan that the

6 EIR lacks.

7 112. The EIR's analysis of recharge applies only to the shallow aquifer and fails to

8 address recharge of the confined aquifer that is located below the Corcoran Layer between the two

9 aquifers that underlie the Project site. The confined aquifer is subject to drawdown but no

10 recharge is contemplated to mitigate that impact. The Project is located in an overdrafted basin

11 and any additional drawdown must be analyzed and mitigated, if possible.

12 113. This failure is exacerbated by the EIR's lack of analysis for supplying water to the

13 population that will accompany the individuals that will be employed at the Project. The water

14 supply analysis only addresses water supply for individuals employed at the Project, thus

15 drawdown will be higher once all water users as a consequence of the Project are analyzed.

16 114. Thus, the analysis of impacts to water supply from the Project is deficient and the

17 reliance on the EIR is an abuse of discretion.

18 3. Water discharges to the San Joaquin River

19 115. To address flood waters, the Project proposes a 380 acre-foot capacity detention

20 pond to reduce flood water flows to equal to or less than existing conditions and then release water
21 slowly from that basin following storm events. (Draft EIR 3.10-32.)

22 116. The Draft EIR acknowledges that this plan will result in hydromodification effects

23 and requires that the County and project applicants prepare site-specific hydromodification studies

24 to address the changes in drainage that result from the Project. (3.10-35-36.)

25 117. These studies are not specifically required to address any changes to runoff or

26 recharge to the San Joaquin River and the hydrologically connected shallow aquifer near the San

27 Joaquin River. Instead, these studies focus on ensuring that water quality and other runoff impacts

28 are mitigated. The EIR assumes that runoff will increase, not decrease as a consequence of the

{CW070799.1} 25
Churchwell White .: Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

P change to the use of retention basin. The potential for the retention basin to reduce runoff and

2 discharge to the San Joaquin River is not considered.

3 118. Additionally, as part of the proposed plan to revise the drainage and discharge for

4 the Project, the EIR proposes to increase the width of the channel bottom of Little Salado Creek.

5 (Draft EIR 3.10-30.) That plan fails to incorporate the procedural requirements of securing

6 regulatory permits such as those provided by the United States Army Corps of Engineers and

7 Regional Water Quality Control Boards as part of the mitigation measures for that portion of the

8 Project.

9 119. This failure prohibits the public and other responsible agencies from fully

10 understanding and evaluating the Project and its associated requirements. As a result, the EIR fails

11 as a document meant to provide information for meaningful public review.

12 E. Wastewater

13 120. Though the EIR identifies onsite wastewater treatment as an option during initial

14 phases of the Project and as an interim measure, the EIR assumes that Patterson's wastewater

15 treatment facility, the Patterson Water Quality Control Facility ("WQCF"), will ultimately be

16 responsible for processing and accommodating the entirety of the Project's wastewater flows.

17 (Draft EIR, 3.15-16; Final EIR 2.3.6-42.)

18 121. It is uncertain if the WQCF will have capacity to meet Project needs as Patterson

19 "did not account for the [P]roject's wastewater flows in its planned design expansion" and

20 "*capacity may need to be added to the WQCF to serve one or more phases of the Project." (Draft

21 EIR 3.15-17; Final EIR 2.3.6-44.) The required expansion to serve the Project and meet

22 Patterson's anticipated needs is neither currently planned nor funded, and additional expansion

23 phases contemplated in the EIR are beyond Patterson's anticipated expansion plans for the WQCF.

24 122. To address this, the EIR requires that before the County issues any building permit

25 for a project to connect to wastewater infrastructure, the applicant for the building permit will "be

26 required to provide written documentation to verify that existing treatment capacity is, or will be,

27 available at the WOCF to support the proposed development" and those "projects within the

28

{CW070799.1} 26
Churchwell White Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

r [Project] shall contribute on a fair-share basis the cost associated with such treatment capacity."

2 (Final EIR 2.3.6-42.)

3 123. The EIR did not address issues raised by Black Water's technical memorandum

4 reviewing the Specific Plan and the scaling of Patterson's WQCF expansion to serve the Project.

5 For example, if the Patterson WQCF is expanded to serve the Project, the expansion would result

6 in only 50% utilization based on the projected flows from the Project. The EIR ignores any
7 growth-inducing impacts related to the remaining, unused treatment capacity that would be created

8 a by a massive expansion of the WQCF.

9 124. This massive oversizing will induce additional growth in Patterson, as the WQCF

10 will be available to serve a significantly larger city population. The EIR does not address this, and

11 numerous other growth-inducing impacts of the Project.

12 125. In addition, the statutory requirements for Patterson to provide wastewater services
13 outside its jurisdictional boundaries will also induce growth that the EIR fails to address. The

14 provision of wastewater services outside of city limits must comply with Government Code section

15 56133 or other applicable laws under the Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Local Government

16 Reorganization Act of 2000, Government Code section 56000 et. seq. The Draft and Final EIR do

17 not accurately describe the necessary steps for Patterson to accept wastewater flows from the

18 Project. The EIR should have properly analyzed the requisite legal process for serving the Project,

19 through an out of boundary service agreement or creation of a regional wastewater treatment

20 facility, and as a result the EIR should have concluded that the Project would induce significant

21 new growth.

22 126. Failing to address these impacts from the Project's reliance on Patterson's WQCF

23 makes the EIR insufficient as an informational document for the Respondent and the general

24 public to properly consider the environmental consequences of the Project. Thus, the

25 Respondent's reliance on the EIR is an abuse of discretion.

26 F. Air Quality

27 127. Chapter 3.2 of the Draft EIR discusses air quality impacts and focuses on impacts

28 from construction emissions, operational emissions, with operational emissions from mobile

(CW070799.1} 27
Churchwell White- Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

sources limited to vehicle trips from "employees, visitors, and goods movement." (Draft EIR, 3.2-

2 28.)

3 128. The EIR fails to analyze air quality impacts from the Project's growth inducing

4 impacts. Particularly, the Project will increase the local population by approximately 34,270.

5 While the EIR accounts for a portion of the population increase as employees of the Project, the

6 remaining portion of the population increase and its impacts on air quality are not discussed in the

7 EIR.

8 129. Further, the increased population will require the local community to engage in

9 additional construction activities, such as building schools, parks, recreational facilities, and

10 improving roads. The EIR failed to analyze these direct, foreseeable impacts.

11 130. The EIR understates and underestimates the Project's air quality impacts. As a
12 result, the EIR fails as an informational document. By relying on an invalid EIR to approve the
13 Project, Respondents have prejudicially abused their discretion.

14 G. Greenhouse Gas Emissions

15 131. The Draft EIR concludes that the Project's greenhouse gas impacts will be
16 "cumulatively considerable." (Draft EIR, 3.7-16.) The Draft EIR analyzes greenhouse gas

17 emissions from construction-related emissions and operational emissions. (Draft EIR, 3.7-16-17.)

18 132. The EIR does not analyze greenhouse gas emissions associated with its growth

19 inducing impacts. Thus, the EIR underestimates and understates the Project's greenhouse gas

20 emissions.

21 H. Cumulative Impacts

22 133. The EIR underestimates the extent its growth inducing impacts will affect the

23 environment. Thus, the EIR failed to evaluate the true severity and significance of the cumulative

24 impacts from the Project. By understating information in the EIR, Respondents could not properly

25 consider and adopt appropriate and effective mitigation measures, skewing its perspective

26 concerning the benefits of the particular project under consideration, and precludes it from gaining

27 true perspective on the consequences of approving the project. Thus, the EIR fails as an

28 informational document and Respondents abused their discretion by relying on the EIR to approve

{CW070799.1) 28
Churchwell White Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 the Project.

2 1. Growth Inducing Impacts

3 134. The Project is estimated to create 14,000 to 15,000 jobs and increase the local

4 population by approximately 34,270, which will require approximately 11,200 new residential

5 units. (Final EIR, 2.2-5.) The EIR assumes that the local community will develop enough housing

6 during Project buildout to accommodate the Project's growth inducing housing requirements.

7 (Final EIR, 2.2-5.) The EIR cites the StanCOG RTP/SCS to state that the County population could

8 increase by 37 percent and employment by 35 percent between 2008 and 2040. (Draft EIR, 5.30.)
Thus, the EIR admits that the cumulative impact of regional growth could "require additional

10 facilities to be constructed, the construction of which could have potentially significant impacts.

11 This is a significant cumulative impact." (Draft EIR, 5-30.)

12 135. The EIR fails to consider that the StanCOG RTP/SCS does not consider the

13 Project's growth inducing impacts in its analysis. The Project could will create additional

14 population and employment growth beyond what is projected in the RTP/SCS. Thus, the EIR

15 underestimates and understates its growth inducing impacts on the environment. The County's

16 increase in population and employment could be substantially higher when the Project's growth

17 inducing impacts are taken into account. The additional resources and housing necessary to

18 accommodate the extra population growth will be more than the EIR estimated.

19 136. By understating and underestimating its growth inducing impacts, the EIR fails to

20 properly analyze the Project's environmental impacts and fails to commit to sufficient enforceable

21 mitigation measures.

22 2. Municipal Services

23 137. The Project is estimated to create 14,000 to 15,000 jobs and increase the local

24 population by approximately 34,270. Of the population growth, approximately 9,200 are estimated

25 to be school-aged children. This increase in population and school-aged children could double the

26 population of nearby Patterson and Newman and their respective school districts. The increased

27 population will also increase the intensity of use of parks, recreational facilities, and other public

28 services and facilities. To accommodate doubling its population and school enrollment, Patterson

{CW070799.1} 29
Churchwell White Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 and Newman will be forced to build new schools, parks, recreational facilities, and other public

2 services and facilities. However, the EIR elected not to speculate as to such impacts on public

3 services and recreation. (Draft EIR 5-29-30.)

4 138. Other planned developments in Patterson and Newman, such as the Villages of

5 Patterson, will also increase the local population and school-aged children population. These

6 cumulative effects are not speculative. The EIR failed to analyze the Project's growth inducing

7 impacts with the impacts of other development in Stanislaus County on public services and

8 recreation. These cumulative impacts will be significant and must be mitigated. To mitigate against

9 these impacts to schools, parks, recreational facilities, and other public services and facilities, the

10 EIR should have analyzed establishing public services and facilities demand program and

11 requiring all leaseholders, developers, and contractions to participate in the program by paying

12 their fair-share.

13 3. Traffic

14 139, The EIR claims to have considered the impacts of both the Patterson General Plan

15 buildout and the buildout of the Project. (Final EIR, 2.3.6-39.) To mitigate against the cumulative

16 impacts of the Project on transportation and traffic infrastructure, the EIR focuses on signalization

17 and lane widening. In particular, the EIR relies on Patterson's plans to implement some of these

18 mitigation measures that are outside the County's jurisdiction.

19 140. Patterson's plans to widen lanes or add signals to specific intersections were

20 developed without consideration of the Project's traffic impacts. While the EIR analyzed buildout

21 of the Patterson General Plan and Project, the EIR failed to analyze how the Project's growth

22 inducing impacts will also impact transportation and traffic infrastructure. Since the Project does

23 not include residential, the EIR's traffic analysis focuses on trips to and from the Project site

24 related to employment. (See Draf EIR, 3.14-13.) Further, Patterson's General Plan and lane

25 widening projects do not taken into account the additional traffic impacts generated by the

26 Project's growth inducing impacts. Thus, the planned mitigation measures may be insufficient to

27 accommodate buildout of the Patterson General Plan, buildout of the Project, and the Project's

28 growth inducing impacts on population and traffic.

(CW070799.1} 30
Churchwell White-* Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 141. By failing to also analyze traffic related to the Project's growth inducing impacts,

2 the EIR grossly understates and underestimates the impact the Project will have on traffic and

3 transportation.

4 4. Wastewater Treatment Facilities

5 142. The Draft EIR states that the Project will "accelerate the need for WQCF

6 expansion."(Draft EIR, 5-41.) The EIR focuses on the County contributing its fair-share basis to

7 fund necessary improvements to expand the City's WQCF to accommodate the Project's demand.

8 (Draft EIR, 5-39.) However, the Draft EIR incorrectly concludes that since "the County would not

9 have any role in the design, location, phasing, or operation [of Patterson's WQCF], the County

10 would not be able to identify methods to reduce or avoid environmental effects of the planning

11 phase or impose mitigation." (Draft EIR, 5-41.) Thus, the cumulative impacts to wastewater

12 treatment facilities is "significant and unavoidable." (Draft EIR, 5-41.)

13 143. The EIR improperly assumes that Patterson has committed itself to expand the

14 WQCF beyond the currently planned Phase III expansion. Given Patterson's growth projections,
15 further WQCF expansions will be required to accommodate wastewater flows from both the

16 Project, the Project's growth inducing impacts, and other planned developments. Patterson has not

17 committed itself to expand the capacity of its WQCF in an amount sufficient to accommodate the

18 Project and its growth inducing impacts.

19 144. The Draft EIR skirts the issue of committing to enforceable mitigation measures

20 for wastewater treatment to address the necessary additional WQCF capacity to serve the Project

21 and any growth it induces. The EIR must analyze additional treatment alternatives and commit

22 itself to enforceable mitigation measures. It fails to do so.

23 5. Water Supply

24 145. The Draft EIR states that "the County is unable to determine whether changes in

25 agricultural practices and development in the Westside Area [including Patterson] would increase

26 water demand and reduce groundwater recharge so that supplies become unsustainable." (Draft

27 EIR 5-38.) Then the County goes onto to assume that there "could be a significant cumulative

28

{CW070799.1} 31
Churchwell White -› Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 impact" based on "the magnitude of the development" but offers no additional mitigation for those

2 impacts. (Id.)

3 146. While the County offers no additional mitigation for the significant cumulative

4 impact on water supply from the Project, the Draft EIR identifies the Sustainable Groundwater

5 Management Act's requirement to prepare a Groundwater Sustainability Plan ("GSP") as a method

6 to address the identified impact. No GSP has yet been developed or adopted. The County can

7 mitigate the impact on water supply by developing and adopting a groundwater monitoring

8 program before the GSP for the basin is adopted in 2020.

9 6. Air Quality

10 147. The EIR analyzed air quality impacts from the Project's construction and

11 operational emissions, with operational emissions focused on vehicle trips from "employees,

12 visitors, and goods movement." (Draft EIR, 3.2-28.)

13 148. The EIR does not analyze the cumulative air quality impacts from the Project, the

14 Project's growth inducing impacts, and buildout of Patterson's General Plan. By failing to also

15 analyze air quality related to the Project's growth inducing impacts, the EIR understates and

16 underestimates the impact the Project will have on air quality.

17 7. Greenhouse Gas Emissions

18 149. The Draft EIR analyzes greenhouse gas emissions from construction-related

19 emissions and operational emissions. (Draft EIR, 3.7-16-17.) The cumulative impact analysis for

20 greenhouse gas emissions is four (4) sentences long. It concludes that the cumulative greenhouse

21 gas emissions is "cumulatively considerable" and that the impact is "significant and unavoidable."

22 (Draft EIR, 5-14.)

23 150. The EIR does not analyze the cumulative greenhouse gas emissions from the

24 Project, the Project's growth inducing impacts, and buildout of Patterson's General Plan. By

25 failing to also analyze greenhouse gas emissions related to the Project's growth inducing impacts,

26 the EIR grossly understates and underestimates the impact the Project will have on greenhouse gas

27 emissions.

Churchwell White: Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 FOURT CAUSE OF ACTION
Abuse of Discretion - Water Supply Assessment Improperly Approved

2 (Violation of Water Code §§ 10910 et seq.)

3 151. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein, as if set forth in full, each and every

4 allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 150.

5 152. The County fails to rely on the information contained in the Water Supply

6 Assessment that was prepared in 2016 by AECOM and fails to include that study in the Final EIR

7 for the Project. Instead, the County relies on the Groundwater Resources Impact Assessment

8 Report and the Water Supply (Potable & Non-Potable) Infrastructure and Facilities Study, both

9 prepared in 2016, to justify its water supply findings in the EIR.

10 153. These studies do not provide the requisite information for the Water Supply

11 Assessment required under Water Code section 10910.

12 154. The Water Supply Assessment also fails to meet the requirements under Water

13 Code section 10910 et seq., including its analysis of alternative surface water supply options and

14 its evaluation of the Project's groundwater demand. (Water Supply Assessment, 2-8--2-9; 3-2-3-

15 5.)

16 155. The demand analysis does not account for the increase in population as a
17 consequence of the Project. Consequently, demand from the Project is understated. The

18 understated demand makes the water supply reliability analysis faulty.

19 156. With the uncertainty in the reliability of groundwater to meet the Project's demand,
20 the alternative analysis of surface supply is cursory and inadequate under Water Code section
21 10910.

22 157. The County abused its discretion and failed to act in the manner required by law in

23 allegedly approving the Water Supply Assessment.
24 PRAYER

25 Wherefore, Petitioners request the following relief and entry of judgment as follows:

26 1. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to vacate

27 and set aside the certification of the EIR and approval of the Project and to withdraw the notice of

28 Determination on the Project;

2 For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing the Respondents to

3 comply with CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, and to take any other action required by Public

4 Resources Code section 21168.9, or as otherwise required by law;
3.

5 For a stay and preliminary and permanent injunction restraining Respondents and

6 its agents, employees, officers, and representatives from undertaking any activity to implement the

7 Project in any way pending full compliance with CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines;
4.

8 For a declaration that Respondents' actions in certifying the EIR and approving the

9 5.

10 For Petitioners' attorneys' fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 and
any other applicable authority;

11 6. Costs of suit; and

12 7.

13 Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
