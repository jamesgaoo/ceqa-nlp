-

2 Title 14, California Code of Regulations, section 15000 et seq. Petitioner seeks a determination from

3 this Court that Respondents' action on November 28, 2017 to approve a project called the "Well 385R

4 Pumping Test Project" is invalid and void because the operation of Well 385R is subject to an adopted

5 CEQA mitigation measure which prohibits the operation of the well; thus, Respondents failed to comply
with CEQA.

6 PARTIES

7

8 2. Petitioner County of Inyo is a political subdivision of the State of California.

9 3. Respondent City is a municipal corporation under the laws of the State of California.

10 Respondent LADWP is a department of the City. Under the City's charter, LADWP manages and

11 controls properties and other assets owned by Respondent City in the Owens Valley. LADWP is

12 governed by five member Board of Water and Power Commissioners whose members are appointed

13 by the Mayor of Los Angeles and confirmed by the Los Angeles City Council ("LADWP Board").
4. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and identities of DOES through 40 and sues such
14 unnamed Respondents by their fictitious names. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges,

15

16 that fictitiously named Defendants also are responsible for all acts and omissions described in this

17 Petition. When the true identities and capacities of Respondents have been determined, Petitioner will,

18 with leave of Court, if necessary, amend this Petition and Complaint to include such identities and
capacities.

19 BACKGROUND FACTS

20

21 5. In 1970, Respondents constructed a second aqueduct to export water from the Owens Valley

22 to the City of Los Angeles (the first aqueduct was completed in 1913).

23 6. In 1972, Petitioner filed suit against Respondents alleging that Respondents' water gathering
activities and groundwater pumping to supply Respondents' second aqueduct were harming the
24 environment of the Owens Valley and that, as required by CEQA, Respondents' activities should be

25 analyzed in an environmental impact report ("EIR").

26

27 7. The Court of Appeal for the Third Appellate District assumed original jurisdiction over the

28 litigation. In 1973, the Court of Appeal issued a writ of mandate which compelled Respondents to

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
2

H

2 prepare an EIR. Subsequently, Respondents prepared two EIRs, each of which
inadequate by the Court of Appeal. was found to be

3

4 8. In 1980, the Inyo County voters adopted a groundwater ordinance to regulate groundwater

5 pumping (including groundwater pumping by LADWP) in the Owens Valley.

6 9. In July 1983, as a result of litigation commenced by Respondents challenging the legality of

7 the County's groundwater management ordinance, the Inyo County Superior Court in case number

8 12908 ruled the ordinance unconstitutional, invalid, and preempted by law, and that the implementation
of the Ordinance should be enjoined.

9

10 10. In 1983, following the ruling by the Inyo County Superior Court, the Petitioner and

11 Respondents began an attempt to develop a long term groundwater management plan that would settle
the litigation between the parties.

12 11. In December 1984, the Court of Appeal ruled that the command of its writ could be met if
13 the Court were to find that an EIR that addressed both the water supply for Respondents' second
14

15 aqueduct and a joint long term groundwater management plan was legally adequate.
12. In August 1989, the parties reached a preliminary agreement on a joint long term
16 groundwater management plan and began preparation of an EIR which addressed the impacts of the

17

18 water supply for Respondents' second aqueduct and the impacts of the joint long term groundwater
management plan.

19

20 13. In 1991, Petitioner and Respondents completed negotiations on a joint long term

21 groundwater management plan commonly known as the Inyo County/Los Angeles Long Term Water
Agreement ("Water Agreement").

22 14. A primary goal of the Water Agreement is for the Department and the County to manage the
23| groundwater (including groundwater pumping) and surface water resources in the Owens Valley to

24

25 avoid causing significant decreases and changes in groundwater dependent vegetation in comparison to

26 the vegetation baseline conditions described in the Water Agreement.

27 15. In October 1991, the Water Agreement was formally approved by the governing bodies of
the Petitioner and the Respondents and Respondents certified an EIR ("1991 EIR") that addressed the
28 environmental impacts of the water supply for Respondents' second aqueduct and the impacts of the

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
3

Water Agreement. The Water Agreement provides that Respondents and the Petitioner are represented
by a "Standing Committee" consisting of elected and appointed officials from each entity and by a
Technical Group consisting of representatives from each entity.

4 16. In accordance with the Appellate Court's writ, the 1991 EIR was submitted to the Court of

5 Appeal along with a motion that the 1991 EIR. be found to be legally adequate and that the Court of
6 Appeal discharge its writ.

7 17. Following the submission of the 1991 EIR to the Court of Appeal, several parties appeared
8 before the Court as amici curiae and challenged the adequacy of the 1991 EIR on the basis that

9 mitigation measures in the 1991 were inadequate.

10 18. In 1994, the Court of Appeals denied the County and Respondents' request to discharge its

11 writ of mandate and ordered the County and the Respondents to respond to the issues raised by the

12 amici.

13 19. In 1997, following an agreement on a Memorandum of Understanding ("1997 MOU")

14 between Petitioner, Respondents, the California Department of Fish and Game (now the California

15 Department of Fish and Wildlife), the California State Lands Commission, the Sierra Club, the Owens
16 Valley Committee and Carla Scheidlinger (the amici), and following a joint motion by the County, the

17 Respondents and the amici, the Court of Appeal discharged its writ.

18 20. Following the discharge of the writ, a Stipulation and Order for Judgment (which
19 Includes the Water Agreement and its technical appendix known as "the Green Book") was filed with
20 the Inyo County Superior Court in case number 12908 and was entered as an order of the Court on June

21 13, 1997.

22 21. Prior to the certification of the 1991 EIR, in March 1987, Respondent LADWP installed two

23 new groundwater wells designated W385 and W386 north of the Owens River in the Five Bridges area

24 of the Laws wellfield in the Owens Valley. Based upon the driller's logs, both wells were drilled to
25 approximately 550 feet below ground surface. The purposes of the wells were to dewater an adjacent
26 gravel mining operation, to supply water to enhancement/mitigation projects in the Owens Valley
27 (enhancement/mitigation projects are identified in the 1991 EIR) and to supply water for export to Los
28 Angeles.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
4

22. W385 and W386 were constructed so that each well would extract groundwater from a depth

2 of approximately 50 feet below ground surface to the maximum depth of the well which allowed the

3 extraction of groundwater from both the surrounding shallow and the deep aquifers.

4 23. Groundwater pumping from W385 and W386 occurred from 1987 to 1989. The groundwater
5 pumping from the two wells lowered the water level in the surrounding shallow aquifer. As a result of

6 the lowered water level in the shallow aquifer, approximately 300 acres of nearby groundwater
dependent vegetation south of the Owens River in the Five Bridges area was adversely impacted ("Five

8 Bridges Impact Area"). In response to the adverse impact to the vegetation, the Department ceased
groundwater pumping from W385 and W386 in April 1989. Except for a two-month pump test of the

10 two wells in 1993-1994, and a brief aquifer test conducted by the drilling contractor after the wells were
11 modified in 2014, the wells have not been operated since 1989.

12 24. Under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), an EIR must propose and
13 describe mitigation measures to minimize the significant environmental effects identified in the EIR.

14 (Public Resources Code section 21002.1(a); 14 Cal Code Regulations section 15126.4.) The requirement

15 that EIRs identify mitigation measures implements CEQA's policy that agencies adopt feasible
16 mitigation measures when approving a project in order to reduce or avoid the significant environmental
17 effects of the project. (Public Resources Code section 21002, 21081(a).) Adopted mitigation measures
18 must be enforceable (Public Resources Code section 21081.6(b); 14 Cal Code Regulations

19 15126.4(a)(2)). This enforceability requirement is designed to ensure that mitigation measures will
20 actually be implemented, not merely adopted and then ignored. (Federation of Hillside & Canyons
21 | Associations v City of Los Angeles (2000) 83 Cal App 4th 1252, 1261.) Mitigation measures adopted
22 when a project is approved may only be modified or deleted if the agency that adopted the measures
23 gives a legitimate reason for making the change and supports those reasons with substantial evidence.

25 359.)

25. The 1991 EIR identifies the impact in the Five Bridges Impact Area caused by the
2 pumping of W385 and W386 as a significant environmental effect and includes Mitigation Measure 10-
12, as mitigation to reduce or avoid the adverse environmental impact caused by the pumping of W385
4 and W386 in the late 1980s. The 1991 EIR states on page 10-58:

5 Impact

6 10-12 Vegetation in an area of approximately 300 acres near Five Bridges

7 Road north of Bishop was significantly adversely affected during 1988

8 because of the operation of two wells, to supply water to
enhancement/mitigation projects.

10 Between 1987 and 1988, two wells in the Five Bridges area that were pumped to supply

11 water to Enhancement/mitigation projects contributed to a lowering of the water table

12 under riparian and meadow areas along Owens River. Approximately 300 acres of

13 vegetation were affected, and within this area, approximately 36 acres lost all vegetation

14 due to a wildfire. The affected area is shown on Figure 10-84.

15 Mitigation Measure

16 10-12 Water has been spread over the affected area since 1988. By the summer

17 of 1990, revegetation of native species had begun on approximately 80

18 percent of the affected area. LADWP and Inyo County are developing a

19 plan to revegetate the entire affected area with riparian and meadow

20 vegetation. This plan will be implemented when it has been completed,
21 26. As noted in the Final 1991 EIR, as part of Mitigation Measure 10-12, pumping from wells

22 W385 and W386 was discontinued to assist in the mitigation of the adverse impact caused by the

23 operation of the wells. Regarding the discontinuation of pumping, on page 3-16 of Volume I of the Final

24 1991 EIR in Chapter 3, titled "Revisions to the Agreement and Draft EIR," it is acknowledged that:

25 Approximately300 acres in the Five Bridges area are being mitigated through a

26 combination of alternatives one and two; that is, pumping has been discontinued in the

27 area, surface water has been supplied to stimulate natural revegetation and active

28 revegetation has occurred in a portion of the area.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 In further support of the fact that pumping from the wells is discontinued as part of Mitigation Measure
10-12 is found in Appendix B-5.to the 1991 Final EIR which is a copy of a report from the "Five
3 Bridges Sub-Group" established by the Technical Group in 1990. On pages B5-2 and B5-3 of Appendix

4

5 B-5, under the sub-heading titled "Completed Mitigation Activities," it is noted that in Apri11989, Wells
W385 and W386 were turned off.

6

7 27. Concerning the completion of a mitigation plan for the vegetation impact in the Five Bridges
Impact Area, Resolution No. 99 099, which was adopted by the LADWP Board on October 15, 1991
8 (Resolution No. 99 099 approved the Water Agreement and the 1991 EIR) states on

9 page 9 that the

10 "Department and Inyo County have developed a revegetation plan" for the Five Bridges area. Further,

11 the Mitigation Monitoring Plan, adopted by the LADWP as part of Resolution 99 099, reiterates on page

12 2 that a "revegetation plan" for the Five Bridges area has been developed by LADWP and the County.

13 As shown in Paragraph 26, the completed revegetation plan provides that W385 and W386 are "turned
off."

14

15 28. During the winter of 1993-1994, a two month pump test of W385 and W386 was conducted.
The two month pump test showed that the pumping of the two wells lowered the water table in the Five
16 Bridges Impact Area.

17 29. On December 8, 1996, Dr. William S. Platts, a principal of Ecosystem Sciences, a consulting
18 firm retained by LADWP to advise LADWP on land and water management issues in the Owens Valley,

19

20 sent a letter to LADWP that contained his recommendations on how to achieve the goal for the Five

21 Bridges Impact Area of reestablishing native grasses and willow in the impacted area. Dr. Platts' letter

22 recommends that LADWP "[S]hut down and plug Pumping wells E/M #385 and E/M #386." The letter

23 also recommends that "Pumping wells E/M #385 and E/M #386 should be shut down permanently to

24 allow watertables [sic] to re-form to natural levels."
30. Section III.F of the 1997 MOU requires the Technical Group to prepare mitigation plans and
25 implementation schedules for all areas for which on-site mitigation measures were adopted in the 1991
26 EIR. (The mitigation adopted in the 1991 EIR for the impact in the Five Bridges area resulting from the

27

28 pumping of W385 and W386 is an on-site mitigation measure.) Section III.F of the 1997 MOU provides:

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
7

The Technical Group will prepare mitigation plans and implementation schedules for all
2 areas for which on-site mitigation measures have been adopted in the EIR. These plans
will be prepared in accordance with the procedures set forth in section I.C.2 of the Green
Book. (The Green Book is the is technical appendix to the Inyo-Los Angeles Agreement.)
The plans will be completed within 12 months of the discharge of the writ. The content of

6 the mitigation plans will be in accordance with the EIR, which provides that on-site
mitigation will be accomplished through revegetation with native Owens Valley species

8 and through establishment of irrigation.

9 31. In accordance with the requirement of section III.F of the 1997 MOU, in 1999, the Technical

10 Group completed a revegetation plan for the impacted vegetation in the Five Bridges area ("1999

11 Revegetation Plan"). Consistent with the recommendations of LADWP's consultant, Dr. William S.

12 Platts, and consistent with Mitigation Measure 10-12, the 1999 Revegetation Plan calls for maintaining

13 the groundwater levels in the impacted area at a "natural level" (1998-ongoing) by a "permanent shut

14 down" of pumping from W385 and W386.

15 32. The mitigation goal for the Fivc Bridgcs impact arca described in the 1999 Rcvegctation

16 Plan is as follows:

17 Goal: Restore the area to a complex of vegetation communities with similar species

18 composition and cover as exists at local similar sites. The goal will be attained when the

19 desired vegetation conditions are achieved and are sustainable. Live cover and

20 composition numbers are from on-site mapping during the 1984-87 vegetation inventory.

21 For Alkali Meadows, live cover goals are 60% composed of four different perennial

22 species. riparian scrub live cover goals are 90% composed of four different perennial

23 species. Composition numbers are 75% of the previously mapped number of species.

24 33. The Mitigation Monitoring Plan adopted by LADWP as part of Resolution 99 099 requires
25 LADWP to prepare and submit an annual report on each adopted mitigation measure to the LADWP

26 Board. In compliance with this requirement, the Department's most recent report, the 2017 Annual

27 Owens Valley Report, in Table 3-3 (following page 3-5) acknowledges that the mitigation for the Five
28 Bridges impact area has been "[F]ully implemented but not meeting goals."

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
8

34. Neither Mitigation Measure 10-12 nor the 1999 Revegetation Plan has been modified or
2 deleted by the LADWP Board of Water and Power Commissioners.
35. In 2014, LADWP modified W385 and W386 by sealing the top approximately 350 feet of

4 each well so that each well, when pumped, would only be capable of extracting groundwater from below

5 the 350 foot level of each well. The modification of the wells also reduced the diameter of each well and

6 reduced the pumping capacity of each well.
36. In 2012, prior to modifying W385 and W386, LADWP adopted an Addendum to the 1991

8 EIR which addressed the environmental effects of the modification of the two wells. The addendum did

9 not refer to W385 and W386 as "new wells." The addendum concluded that no additional environmental
10 review of the well modification project was required.

11 37. On November 28, 2017, the LADWP Board approved a project ("Well 385R Pumping Test

12 Project") which is described by LADWP as follows:

13 LADWP proposes to conduct a 2 month pumping test of W385R. Data from the pumping

14 test will be used to calibrate the groundwater model for the Bishop/Laws Wellfield, and

15 to document that Well 385R is functionally distinct from original Well385. Approximately

16 2.8 cfs will be pumped continuously from W385R and discharged through the Fish

17 Slough channel to the Owens River. The pumping test is proposed for winter 2017-2018.

18 No construction is required to conduct the pumping test.

19 38. Prior to approving the above described project, the LADWP Board adopted an Initial
20 Study/Negative Declaration ("*Negative Declaration"), which concluded that the approved pumping test

21 of W385R would have no significant effect on the environment. Despite that conclusion, the Negative

22 Declaration acknowledges 011 page 2-9 that "..the proposed 2-month 2.8 cfs pumping test from the deep

23 aquifer would result in a modeled groundwater drawdown of 0.76 to 1.41 feet" in the Five Bridges

24 Impact Area.

25 39. On page 1-2, the Negative Declaration states that LADWP believes that: "[A]s modified, the

26 wells are hydrologically distinct from original W385 and W386; therefore the wells are considered new

27 wells by LADWP and have been renamed W385R and W386R."

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

40. Section VI of the Water Agreement, which addresses "New Wells and Production
2 Capacity," sets forth the provisions for the Technical Group to site, evaluate, test, manage and monitor
3 new wells. Section VI provides:

4 VI. NEW WELLS AND PRODUCTION CAPACITY

5 The Department's current groundwater pumping capacity may be increased to

6 provide increased operational flexibility and to facilitate rotational pumping- The

7 Department may replace existing wells and construct new wells in areas where

8 hydrogeologic conditions are favorable, and where the operation of that well will not

9 cause a change in vegetation that would be inconsistent with these goals and principles.
10 Prior to the Department's construction of new wells, the location of each well shall be

11 iointly evaluated by the Technical Group as to the potential impact of its operation on the

12 valley's vegetation and environment. The evaluation shall include the drilling of one or

13 more test holes, if needed, to develop information on the hydrogeologic conditions at the
14 site, an inventory and classification of vegetation that could be affected by the operation

15 of the well, and the assessment of any other potential significant effects on the

16 environment.

17 Each new well will generally reflect optimum design parameters considering

18 location, economics, and current practice in the industry. The Department will schedule

19 and contract for construction of the well.

20 An aquifer lest of up to seventy-two (72) hours duration shall be conducted on each

21 new well. One existing or new monitoring well with appropriate perforations is necessary
22 for the aquifer test. The Technical Group shall determine the location of this monitoring

23 well and the need for any additional monitoring wells and the length of the aquifer test.
24 All data generated from the well construction process shall promptly be made
25 available to the County. The County shall make application for and obtain any well
26 construction permits required by the County or any subdivision thereof. It is recognized
27 that this new well program may result in a change in the areas that would be affected by
28 pumping from existing wells. Therefore, additional monitoring of groundwater tables and

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
10

vegetation shall be implemented as necessary outside of existing management areas and

2 monitoring requirements shall be altered or created as necessary. The Technical Group
c shall designate a management area and monitoring site requirements for each new well.
The siting and the operation of the well shall be consistent with these goals and
principles.
Only one well initially shall be constructed and operated in any new area. No
additional well(s) shall be installed in the area until the initial well has been operated for

8 at least six (6) months at full intended operational capacity in order to gain information
on the area and to minimize the potential for adverse impacts.

10 During this initial period of operation, the Technical group shall monitor water levels

11 and vegetation conditions in accordance with a jointly developed monitoring program.

12 Additional wells may be installed by the Department in the area if operation of the initial

13 well indicates no impacts that would be inconsistent with these goals and principles.
14 Monitoring wells shall be installed as necessary to evaluate any potential effects of

15 the operation of the new well or wells on wells not owned by the Department.

16 (Underlining added to emphasize the role of the Technical Group.)

17 41. None of the actions required of the Technical Group by Section VI of the Water Agreement
18 were performed before or after LADWP re-characterized W385 as new well.

19 42. On December 6, 2017, Respondents filed a Notice of Determination on the proposed W385R
20 pumping test project with the Inyo County Clerk.
21 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES AND INADEQUACY OF

22 REMEDY

23 43. On October 17, 2017, Petitioner exhausted administrative remedies on each violation of
24 CEQA described below by sending a letter to Respondents providing comments on the draft Initial
25 Study/Negative Declaration for the Well 385R Pumping Test Project. In addition, other letters of

26 comment on the draft Initial Study/Negative Declaration which addressed the issues raised in this

27 Petition were sent to LADWP by other individuals, entities and organizations. Under the circumstances,

28 Petitioner has exhausted all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
11

- INADEQUACY OF REMEDIES

2 44. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law unless this

3 Court grants the requested Writ of Mandate. In the absence of the granting of the requested remedies,

4 Respondent LADWP's actions described below will remain in effect in violation of CEQA. The
5 granting of the requested remedies is in the public interest.

6 NOTICE OF PETITION AND STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

7 45. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

8 21167.5 by serving written notice of this Petition to Respondents. A copy of this written notice (without

9 the draft copy of this Petition that was attached to the notice) and proof of service are attached as Exhibit

10 A to this Petition.

11 46. As required by Public Resources Code section 21167(a) and CEQA Guideline section

12 15112(c)(5), this action has been brought within 30 days after Respondent LADWP's filing of a Notice

13 of Determination with the Inyo County Clerk.

14 STANDING

15 47. As a signatory of the Water Agrocment and as the local government with jurisdiction over
16 groundwater management in the Owens Valley, Petitioner has a beneficial interest in ensuring that

17 Respondents comply with CEQA. Petitioner is adversely affected by Respondent LADWP's failure to

18 comply with CEQA. Moreover, with regard to the Water Agreement, Petitioner is a "responsible

19 agency" under CEQA and, as such, relied on the adequacy of Respondents' 1991 EIR to approve the

20 Water Agreement. For the foregoing reasons, Petitioner has standing to bring this Petition. Petitioner
21 brings this action as a private attorney general under Code of Civil Procedure § 1021.5.

22 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

23 48. This Petition is brought under CEQA and its implementing Guidelines which must be

24 followed by state and local agencies when undertaking projects subject to CEQA. This Court has
25 jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5

26 and Public Resources Code sections 21168. In the alternative, this Court also has jurisdiction over the

27 matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Code section 1085 and Public

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
12

Resources Code section 21168.5. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 394 (a) and (b), since

2 this action is not one which requires a jury trial, venue is proper in this Court.

3 CAUSE OF ACTION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE--VIOLATION OF CEQA
49. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 48 inclusive of this
5 Petition as if fully set forth below.

6 50. The approval of the Well 385R Pumping Test Project by the LADWP Board is a violation of
CEQA in that the approved project is completely inconsistent with Mitigation Measure 10-12 and with

8 the 1999 Revegetation Plan. Both measures require that W385R not be operated under any
9 circumstances in order to assist in mitigating the significant adverse vegetation impacts in the Five

10 Bridges Impact Area caused by the operation of W385 and W386 in the late 1980s. The need for the

11 continuation of these mitigation measures is especially urgent since the mitigation goals for the
12 significantly impacted vegetation in the Five Bridges area have not been achieved and the Negative

13 Declaration adopted by LADWP admits that the proposed test of W385R will lower the water table in

14 the Five Bridges Impact Area. (See page 2-9 of the Negative Declaration.)

15 51. Although the Negative Declaration adopted by the LADWP Board contains a section
16 titled "Applicable Plans and Policies," the Negative Declaration fails to acknowledge or mention the

17 1999 Revegetation Plan even though the 1999 Revegetation Plan is an adopted mitigation measure as

18 required by the 1997 MOU. The requirement in the 1999 Revegetation Plan that Wells W385 and W386
19 be "permanently shut down" has not been modified or deleted by the LADWP Board. Under the 1999
20 Revegetation Plan, the proposed pump test of W385R cannot take place. Moreover, although the section
21 acknowledges that the operation of W385R is subject to the Water Agreement, it does not explain how a
22 new well can come into existence in the absence of the Technical Group performing its obligations

23 under Water Agreement section VI, to site, evaluate, test, manage and monitor the new well.
24 a 52. There is a lack of substantial evidence to support the finding in the Negative Declaration
25 on page 1-3 that: "As a temporary data collection project, the pumping test of new W385R (which has
26 fundamentally different functional characteristics from original W385) is not analogous to the original
27 purpose of the well - long term operation of the well for dewatering. Therefore, the proposed pumping
28 test project does not require modification of Mitigation Measure 10-12 of the 1991 EIR." Contrary to the

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
13

statement on page 1-3, on page 1-2, the Negative Declaration acknowledges that the original purposes of

2 W385 are not limited to dewatering. On page 1-2, the Negative Declaration states that the purposes of

3 W385 are: (1) dewatering an adjacent gravel mining operation, (2) supplying water to

4 enhancement/mitigation projects in the Owens Valley and (3) to supplying water for export to Los
Angeles. Therefore, with the possible exception of dewatering the adjacent gravel mining operation, the

6 functional characteristics of W385R remain the same as the original functional characteristics of W385.
7 Consequently, there is no substantial evidence to support the finding that Mitigation Measure 10-12 is

8 not applicable (or the implication that the 1999 Revegetation Plan is not applicable) or to support is
9 LADWP's conclusion that Mitigation Measure 10-12 does not need to be modified because W385R has
10 functional characteristics different from W385. To the contrary, Mitigation Measure 10-12 and the 1999
11 Revegetation Plan must be modified before W385R can be operated.
12 53. There is lack of substantial evidence to support the finding on page 1-2 of the Negative
13 Declaration that: "[A]s modified, the wells are hydrologically distinct from original W385 and W386;

14 therefore the wells are considered new wells by LADWP and have been renamed W385R and W386R."
15 (Underlining added for emphasis.) Despite the contention in the Negative Declaration, the modification
16 of W385 (and W386) does not convert the wells into "new wells." 'The existing borehole is in the

17 original location, and the well casing and screen in both wells are the same as installed originally. The
18 modification of the wells does not change the fact that operation of W385R during the proposed test will
19 lower the groundwater level in the Five Bridges Impact Area, nor does it alter the fact that the mitigation
20 goals for the significantly impacted area have not be achieved. If LADWP was certain that the pumping
21 of W385R would not affect the groundwater level in the Five Bridges Impact Area, there would be no
22 need to conduct the proposed test. Mitigation Measure 10-12 requires that W385 and W386 be "turned
23 off and the requirement of the 1999 Revegetation Plan that pumping from W385 and W386 be
24 "permanently shut down" were both designed and adopted to protect the impacted area from the effects
25 of any additional pumping from the wells--whether for the purpose of supplying water or for the purpose
26 of a test.

27 54. LADWP's re-characterization of W385 as a "new well" and its position with regard to
28 Mitigation Measure 10-12 is analogous to a position that Respondent City took with regard to a

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
14

1 mitigation measure that it adopted for a redevelopment project in the Venice Beach area of the City of
2 Los Angeles. In the case of Lincoln Place Tenants Association v City of Los Angeles (2005) 130
3 Cal.App.4th 1491, the Court held that Los Angeles could not disregard the mitigating conditions it
4 placed on the demolition of the buildings by simply declaring that the demolition of the buildings was a

5 "different project" from the original redevelopment project. The court found the distinction drawn by the

6 city and the owners between the "demolition project" and the "redevelopment project," was
7 disingenuous at best. In this regard, the Court stated that:

8 "[U]nder a CEQA a "project" is "an activity which may cause either a direct physical
9 change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the
10 environment[.]" This definition is amplified in the CEQA Guidelines, which define a
11 "project" as "the whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in" a direct or
12 indirect physical change in the environment. Thus, CEQA's requirements "cannot be
13 avoided by chopping up proposed projects into bite-size pieces which, individually
14 considered, might be found to have no significant effect on the environment or to be only
15 ministerial." (Lincoln Place, supra, at page 1507.)
16 The Court continued on page 1509 by noting that:
17 [HJaving placed these conditions on the demolition segment of the redevelopment
18 project, the city cannot simply ignore them. Mitigating conditions are not mere

19 expressions of hope. Section 21002.1, subdivision (b) states: "Each public agency shall
20 mitigate or avoid the significant effects on the environment of projects that it carries out
21 or approves whenever it is feasible to do $o. Furthermore, "[a] public agency shall
22 provide that measures to mitigate or avoid significant effects on the environment are fully
23 enforceable through permit conditions, agreements, or other measures. "The purpose of
24 these requirements is to ensure that feasible mitigation measures will actually be
25 implemented as a condition of development, and not merely adopted and then neglected
26 or disregarded."

27 55. An existing well that is modified does not become a new well in the same way that an
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
15

1 existing car that is modified does not become a new car. As noted in Paragraph 24, the mitigation
2 measures adopted by LADWP that prohibit the pumping of W385 may be modified or deleted if

3 LADWP were to provide a legitimate reason for making the change and were to support those reasons

4 with substantial evidence. If LADWP believes that Mitigation Measure 10-12 and the 1999

5 Revegetation Plan should not apply to the proposed pump test of W385R, instead of attempting to
6 mischaracterize W385 as a new well in its Negative Declaration, the appropriate action would be for
7 LADWP to temporarily modify the mitigation measures and to provide substantial evidence justifying

8 the change in an addendum to the 1991 EIR. (This procedure was explained in Petitioner's letter
9 presenting comments on LADWP's Negative Declaration.)

10 56. LADWP committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion when it re-characterized W385 as a

11 new well. Not only is there a lack of substantial evidence to support LADWP's re-characterization of the

12 well; but also, none of the obligations of the Technical Group, under Water Agreement section VI, to

13 site, evaluate, test, manage and monitor the new well were fulfilled before or after W385 was re-
14 characterized by LADWP as new well; thus LADWP did not proceed in the manner required by law in
15| determining that W385 is a now well. If LADWP were to seek to avoid the Technical Group's
16 obligations concerning a new well, the Water Agreement would have to be amended to modify or delete

17 the Technical Group's obligations. Such an amendment would be a project subject to CEQA.
18 57. Respondents' action in adopting the Negative Declaration constitutes a violation of

19 CEQA in that, by failing to enforce Mitigation Measure 10-12 and the 1999 Revegetation Plan,

20 Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law. Based upon substantial evidence in the
21 record (the failure to enforce Mitigation Measure 10-12 and the 1999 Revegetation Plan), a "fair
22 argument" exists that the project may have a significant impact on the environment. As the California
23 Supreme Court has interpreted CEQA, the purpose of CEQA is to "…afford the fullest possible
24 protection to the environment..." See Friends of Mammoth v Board of Supervisors (1972) 8 Cal 3d 247,
25 259. Such protection of the environment will not be afforded if LADWP is allowed to conduct the pump
26 test of W385 in violation of CEQA.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
1

Title 14, California Code of Regulations, section 15000 et seq. Petitioner seeks a determination from

2 this Court that Respondents' action on November 28, 2017 to approve a project called the "Well 385R

3 Pumping Test Project" is invalid and void because the operation of Well 385R is subject to an adopted

4 CEQA mitigation measure which prohibits the operation of the well; thus, Respondents failed to comply

5 with CEQA.

6 PARTIES

7 2. Petitioner County of Inyo is a political subdivision of the State of California.

8 3. Respondent City is a municipal corporation under the laws of the State of California.
9 Respondent LADWP is a department of the City. Under the City's charter, LADWP manages and
10 controls properties and other assets owned by Respondent City in the Owens Valley, LADWP is
11 governed by a five member Board of Water and Power Commissioners whose members are appointed
12 by the Mayor of Los Angeles and confirmed by the Los Angeles City Council ("LADWP Board").
13 4. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and identities of DOES 1 through 40 and sues such
14 unnamed Respondents by their fictitious names. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges,
15 that fictitiously named Defendants also are responsible for all acts and omissions described in this
16 Petition. When the true identities and capacities of Respondents have been determined, Petitioner will,
17 with leave of Court, if necessary, amend this Petition and Complaint to include such identities and
18 capacities.

19 BACKGROUND FACTS

20 5. In 1970, Respondents constructed a second aqueduct to export water from the Owens Valley
21 to the City of Los Angeles (the first aqueduct was completed in 1913).

22 6. In 1972, Petitioner filed suit against Respondents alleging that Respondents' water gathering
23 activities and groundwater pumping to supply Respondents' second aqueduct were harming the
24 environment of the Owens Valley and that, as required by CEQA, Respondents' activities should be
25 analyzed in an environmental impact report ("EIR").

26 7. The Court of Appeal for the Third Appellate District assumed original jurisdiction over the
27 litigation. In 1973, the Court of Appeal issued a writ of mandate which compelled Respondents to
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
2

prepare an EIR. Subsequently, Respondents prepared two EIRs, each of which was found to be

2 inadequate by the Court of Appeal.
8. In 1980, the Inyo County voters adopted a groundwater ordinance to regulate groundwater

4 pumping (including groundwater pumping by LADWP) in the Owens Valley.

5 9. In July 1983, as a result of litigation commenced by Respondents challenging the legality of

6 the County's groundwater management ordinance, the Inyo County Superior Court in case number

7 12908 ruled the ordinance unconstitutional, invalid, and preempted by law, and that the implementation

8 of the Ordinance should be enjoined.

9 10. In 1983, following the ruling by the Inyo County Superior Court, the Petitioner and

10 Respondents began an attempt to devclop a long term groundwater management plan that would settle

11 the litigation between the parties.

12 11. In December 1984, the Court of Appeal ruled that the command of its writ could be met if

13 the Court were to find that an EIR that addressed both the water supply for Respondents' second
14 aqueduct and a joint long term groundwater management plan was legally adequate.

15 12. In August 1989, the parties reached a preliminary agreement on a joint long term
16 groundwater management plan and began preparation of an EIR which addressed the impacts of the

17 water supply for Respondents' second aqueduct and the impacts of the joint long term groundwater

18 management plan.

19 13. In 1991, Petitioner and Respondents completed negotiations on a joint long term
20 groundwater management plan commonly known as the Inyo County/Los Angeles Long Term Water
21 Agreement ("Water Agreement").

22 14. A primary goal of the Water Agreement is for the Department and the County to manage the

23 groundwater (including groundwater pumping) and surface water resources in the Owens Valley to
24 avoid causing significant decreases and changes in groundwater dependent vegetation in comparison to

25 the vegetation baseline conditions described in the Water Agreement.

26 15. In October 1991, the Water Agreement was formally approved by the governing bodies of
27 the Petitioner and the Respondents and Respondents certified an EIR ("1991 EIR") that addressed the
28 environmental impacts of the water supply for Respondents' second aqueduct and the impacts of the

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
3

Water Agreement. The Water Agreement provides that Respondents and the Petitioner are represented

2 by a "Standing Committee" consisting of elected and appointed officials from each entity and by a

3 Technical Group consisting of representatives from each entity.
16. In accordance with the Appellate Court's writ, the 1991 EIR was submitted to the Court of
5 Appeal along with a motion that the 1991 a EIR be found to be legally adequate and that the Court of
6 Appeal discharge its writ.
17. Following the submission of the 1991 EIR to the Court of Appeal, several parties appeared

8 before the Court as amici curiae and challenged the adequacy of the 1991 EIR on the basis that
9 mitigation measures in the 1991 were inadequate.

10 18. In 1994, the Court of Appeals denied the County and Respondents' request to discharge its

11 writ of mandate and ordered the County and the Respondents to respond to the issues raised by the

12 amici.

13 19. In 1997, following an agreement on a Memorandum of Understanding ("1997 MOU")

14 between Petitioner, Respondents, the California Department of Fish and Game (now the California

15 Department of Fish and Wildlife), the California State Lands Commission, the Sierra Club, the Owens

16 Valley Committee and Carla Scheidlinger (the amici), and following a joint motion by the County, the
17 Respondents and the amici, the Court of Appeal discharged its writ.

18 20. Following the discharge of the writ, a Stipulation and Order for Judgment (which

19 Includes the Water Agreement and its technical appendix known as "the Green Book") was filed with

20 the Inyo County Superior Court in case number 12908 and was entered as an order of the Court on June

21 13, 1997.

22 21. Prior to the certification of the 1991 EIR, in March 1987, Respondent LADWP installed two
23 new groundwater wells designated W385 and W386 north of the Owens River in the Five Bridges area

24 of the Laws wellfield in the Owens Valley. Based upon the driller's logs, both wells were drilled to
25 approximately 550 feet below ground surface. The purposes of the wells were to dewater an adjacent
26 gravel mining operation, to supply water to enhancement/mitigation projects in the Owens Valley
27 (enhancement/mitigation projects are identified in the 1991 EIR) and to supply water for export to Los

28 Angeles.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
4

22. W385 and W386 were constructed so that each well would extract groundwater from a depth

2 of approximately 50 feet below ground surface to the maximum depth of the well which allowed the
extraction of groundwater from both the surrounding shallow and the deep aquifers.

4 23. Groundwater pumping from W385 and W386 occurred from 1987 to 1989. The groundwater
5 pumping from the two wells lowered the water level in the surrounding shallow aquifer. As a result of

6 the lowered water level in the shallow aquifer, approximately 300 acres of nearby groundwater

7 dependent vegetation south of the Owens River in the Five Bridges area was adversely impacted (Five

8 Bridges Impact Area"). In response to the adverse impact to the vegetation, the Department ceased
9 groundwater pumping from W385 and W386 in April 1989. Except for a two-month pump test of the

10 two wells in 1993-1994, and a brief aquifer test conducted by the drilling contractor after the wells were

11 modified in 2014, the wells have not been operated since 1989.

12 24. Under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), an EIR must propose and
13 describe mitigation measures to minimize the significant environmental effects identified in the EIR.
14 (Public Resources Code section 21002.1(a); 14 Cal Code Regulations section 15126.4.) The requirement

15 that EIRs identify mitigation mcasurcs imploments CEQA's policy that agencies adopt feasible
16 mitigation measures when approving a project in order to reduce or avoid the significant environmental

17 effects of the project. (Public Resources Code section 21002, 21081(a).) Adopted mitigation measures
18 must be enforceable (Public Resources Code section 21081.6(b); 14 Cal Code Regulations

19 15126.4(a)(2)). This enforceability requirement is designed to ensure that mitigation measures will
20 actually be implemented, not merely adopted and then ignored. (Federation of Hillside & Canyons
21 Associations v City of Los Angeles (2000) 83 Cal App 4th 1252, 1261.) Mitigation measures adopted
22 when a project is approved may only be modified or deleted if the agency that adopted the measures

23 gives a legitimate reason for making the change and supports those reasons with substantial evidence.
24 (Napa Citizens for Honest Government v Napa County Board of Supervisors (2001) 91 Cal App 4th 342,
25 359.)

25. The 1991 EIR identifies the impact in the Five Bridges Impact Area caused by the

3 pumping of W385 and W386 as a significant environmental effect and includes Mitigation Measure 10-
12, as mitigation to reduce or avoid the adverse environmental impact caused by the pumping of W385
4 and W386 in the late 1980s. The 1991 EIR states on page 10-58:

5 Impact

6 10-12

7 Vegetation in an area of approximately 300 acres near Five Bridges

8 Road north of Bishop was significantly adversely affected during 1988

o because of the operation of two wells, to supply water to
enhancement/mitigation projects.

10

11 Between 1987 and 1988, two wells in the Five Bridges area that were pumped to supply

12 water to Enhancement/mitigation projects contributed to a lowering of the water table

13 under riparian and meadow areas along Owens River. Approximately 300 acres of

14 vegetation were affected, and within this area, approximately 36 acres lost all vegetation

15 due to a wildfire. The affected area is shown on Figure 10-8A.

Mitigation Measure

16 10-12

17 Water has been spread over the affected area since 1988. By the summer

18 of 1990, revegetation of native species had begun on approximately 80

19 percent of the affected area. LADWP and Inyo County are developing a

20 plan to revegetate the entire affected area with riparian and meadow

21 vegetation. This plan will be implemented when it has been completed,

22 26. As noted in the Final 1991 EIR, as part of Mitigation Measure 10-12, pumping from wells

23 W385 and W386 was discontinued to assist in the mitigation of the adverse impact caused by the

24 operation of the wells. Regarding the discontinuation of pumping, on page 3-16 of Volume I of the Final

25 1991 EIR in Chapter 3, titled "Revisions to the Agreement and Draft EIR," it is acknowledged that:

26 Approximately300 acres in the Five Bridges area are being mitigated through a

27 combination of alternatives one and two; that is, pumping has been discontinued in the

28 area, surface water has been supplied to stimulate natural revegetation and active
revegetation has occurred in a portion of the area.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
6

In further support of the fact that pumping from the wells is discontinued as part of Mitigation Measure

2 10-12 is found in Appendix B-5 to the 1991 Final EIR which is a copy of a report from the "Five
Bridges Sub-Group" established by the Technical Group in 1990. On pages B5-2 and B5-3 of Appendix

4 B-5, under the sub-heading titled "Completed Mitigation Activities," it is noted that in Apri11989, Wells

5 W385 and W386 were turned off.

6 27. Concerning the completion of a mitigation plan for the vegetation impact in the Five Bridges

7 Impact Area, Resolution No. 99 099, which was adopted by the LADWP Board on October 15, 1991

8 (Resolution No. 99 099 approved the Water Agreement and the 1991 EIR) states on page 9 that the
9 "Department and Inyo County have developed a revegetation plan" for the Five Bridges area. Further,

10 the Mitigation Monitoring Plan, adopted by the LADWP as part of Resolution 99 099, reiterates on page

11 2 that a "revegetation plan" for the Five Bridges area has been developed by LADWP and the County.

12 As shown in Paragraph 26, the completed revegetation plan provides that W385 and W386 are "turned
13 off."

14 28. During the winter of 1993-1994, a two month pump test of W385 and W386 was conducted.

15 The two month pump test showed that the pumping of the two wells lowered the water table in the Five
16 Bridges Impact Area.

17 29. On December 8, 1996, Dr. William S. Platts, a principal of Ecosystem Sciences, a consulting

18 firm retained by LADWP to advise LADWP on land and water management issues in the Owens Valley,

19 sent a letter to LADWP that contained his recommendations on how to achieve the goal for the Five

20 Bridges Impact Arca of reestablishing native grasses and willow in the impacted area. Dr. Platts' letter

21 recommends that LADWP "[S]hut down and plug Pumping wells E/M #385 and E/M #386." The letter

22 also recommends that "Pumping wells E/M #385 and E/M #386 should be shut down permanently to

23 allow watertables [sic] to re-form to natural levels."

24 30. Section III.F of the 1997 MOU requires the Technical Group to prepare mitigation plans and
25 implementation schedules for all areas for which on-site mitigation measures were adopted in the 1991

26 EIR. (The mitigation adopted in the 1991 EIR for the impact in the Five Bridges area resulting from the
27 pumping of W385 and W386 is an on-site mitigation measure.) Section III.F of the 1997 MOU provides:

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
7

2
W The Technical Group will prepare mitigation plans and implementation schedules for all
areas for which on-site mitigation measures have been adopted in the EIR. These plans

ur will be prepared in accordance with the procedures set forth in section I.C.2 of the Green

6 Book. (The Green Book is the is technical appendix to the Inyo-Los Angeles Agreement.)
The plans will be completed within 12 months of the discharge of the writ. The content of
the mitigation plans will be in accordance with the EIR, which provides that on-site

8 mitigation will be accomplished through revegetation with native Owens Valley species

9 and through establishment of irrigation.

10

11 31. In accordance with the requirement of section III.F of the 1997 MOU, in 1999, the Technical
Group completed a revegetation plan for the impacted vegetation in the Five Bridges area ("1999
Revegetation Plan"). Consistent with the recommendations of LADWP's consultant, Dr. William S.
12 Platts, and consistent with Mitigation Measure 10-12, the 1999 Revegetation Plan calls for maintaining

13

14

15 the groundwater levels in the impacted area at a "natural level" (1998-ongoing) by a "permanent shut
down" of pumping from W385 and W386.

16 Plan is as follows:

17 32. The mitigation goal for the Five Bridges impact area described in the 1999 Revegetation

18 Goal: Restore the area to a complex of vegetation communities with similar species

19 composition and cover as exists at local similar sites. The goal will be attained when the

20 desired vegetation conditions are achieved and are sustainable. Live cover and

21

22 composition numbers are from on-site mapping during the 1984-87 vegetation inventory.
For Alkali Meadows, live cover goals are 60% composed of four different perennial

23 species. riparian scrub live cover goals are 90% composed of four different perennial

24 species. Composition numbers are 75% of the previously mapped number of species.

25 LADWP to prepare

26 33. The Mitigation Monitoring Plan adopted by LADWP as part of Resolution 99 099 requires

27 and submit an annual report on cach adopted mitigation measure to the LADWP

28 Board. In compliance with this requirement, the Department's most recent report, the 2017 Annual
Owens Valley Report, in Table 3-3 (following page 3-5) acknowledges that the mitigation for the Five
Bridges impact area has been "[F]ully implemented but not meeting goals."

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
8

P 34. Neither Mitigation Measure 10-12 nor the 1999 Revegetation Plan has been modified or

2 deleted by the LADWP Board of Water and Power Commissioners.

3 35. In 2014, LADWP modified W385 and W386 by sealing the top approximately 350 feet of

4 each well so that each well, when pumped, would only be capable of extracting groundwater from below

5 the 350 foot level of each well. The modification of the wells also reduced the diameter of each well and

6 reduced the pumping capacity of each well.

7 36. In 2012, prior to modifying W385 and W386, LADWP adopted an Addendum to the 1991

8 EIR which addressed the environmental effects of the modification of the two wells. The addendum did

9 not refer to W385 and W386 as "new wells." The addendum concluded that no additional environmentall
10 review of the well modification project was required.

11 37. On November 28, 2017, the LADWP Board approved a project ("Well 385R Pumping Test
12 Project") which is described by LADWP as follows:

13 LADWP proposes to conduct a 2 month pumping test of W385R. Data from the pumping

14 test will be used to calibrate the groundwater model for the Bishop/Laws Wellfield, and

15 to document that Well 385R is functionally distinct from original Well385. Approximately
16 2.8 cfs will be pumped continuously from W385R and discharged through the Fish

17 Slough channel to the Owens River. The pumping test is proposed for winter 2017-2018.

18 No construction is required to conduct the pumping test.

19 38. Prior to approving the above described project, the LADWP Board adopted an Initial
20 Study/Negative Declaration ("Negative Declaration"), which concluded that the approved pumping test
21 of W385R would have no significant effect on the environment. Despite that conclusion, the Negative

22 Declaration acknowledges on page 2-9 that ".the proposed 2-month 2.8 cfs pumping test from the deep
23 aquifer would result in a modeled groundwater drawdown of 0.76 to 1.41 feet" in the Five Bridges

24 Impact Area.

25 39. On page 1-2, the Negative Declaration states that LADWP believes that: "[A]s modified, the

26 wells are hydrologically distinct from original W385 and W386; therefore the wells are considered new

27 wells by LADWP and have been renamed W385R and W386R."

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

40. Section VI of the Water Agreement, which addresses "New Wells and Production

2 Capacity," sets forth the provisions for the Technical Group to site, evaluate, test, manage and monitor

3 new wells. Section VI provides:

4 VI. NEW WELLS AND PRODUCTION CAPACITY

5 The Department's current groundwater pumping capacity may be increased to

6 provide increased operational flexibility and to facilitate rotational pumping- The

7 Department may replace existing wells and construct new wells in areas where

8 hydrogeologic conditions are favorable, and where the operation of that well will not
cause a change in vegetation that would be inconsistent with these goals and principles.

10 Prior to the Department's construction of new wells, the location of each well shall be

11 jointly evaluated by the Technical Group as to the potential impact of its operation on the

12 valley's vegetation and environment. The evaluation shall include the drilling of one or
13 more test holes, if needed, to develop information on the hydrogeologic conditions at the
14 site, an inventory and classification of vegetation that could be affected by the operation
15 of the well, and the assessment of any other potential significant effects on the
16 environment.

17 Each new well will generally reflect optimum design parameters considering
18 location, economics, and current practice in the industry. The Department will schedule

19 and contract for construction of the well.

20 An aquifer lest of up to seventy-two (72) hours duration shall be conducted on each
21 new well. One existing or new monitoring well with appropriate perforations is necessary
22 for the aquifer test. The Technical Group shall determine the location of this monitoring

23 well and the need for any additional monitoring wells and the length of the aquifer test.

24 All data generated from the well construction process shall promptly be made
25 available to the County. The County shall make application for and obtain any well
26 construction permits required by the County or any subdivision thereof. It is recognized
27 that this new well program may result in a change in the areas that would be affected by
28 pumping from existing wells. Therefore, additional monitoring of groundwater tables and

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
10

F vegetation shall be implemented as necessary outside of existing management areas and

2 monitoring requirements shall be altered or created as necessary. The Technical Group
co shall designate a management area and monitoring site requirements for each new well.
The siting and the operation of the well shall be consistent with these goals and
ün principles.
en Only one well initially shall be constructed and operated in any new area. No

7 additional well(s) shall be installed in the area until the initial well has been operated for

8 at least six (6) months at full intended operational capacity in order to gain information
on the area and to minimize the potential for adverse impacts.

10 During this initial period of operation, the Technical group shall monitor water levels

11 and vegetation conditions in accordance with a jointly developed monitoring program.

12 Additional wells may be installed by the Department in the area if operation of the initial

13 well indicates no impacts that would be inconsistent with these goals and principles.
14 Monitoring wells shall be installed as necessary to evaluate any potential effects of

15 the operation of the new well or wells on wells not owned by the Department.

16 (Underlining added to emphasize the role of the Technical Group.)

17 41. None of the actions required of the Technical Group by Section VI of the Water Agreement
18 were performed before or after LADWP re-characterized W385 as a new well.

19 42. On December 6, 2017, Respondents filed a Notice of Determination on the proposed W385R

20 pumping test project with the Inyo County Clerk.
21 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES AND INADEQUACY OF

22 REMEDY

23 43. On October 17, 2017, Petitioner exhausted administrative remedies on each violation of

24 CEQA described below by sending a letter to Respondents providing comments on the draft Initial

25 Study/Negative Declaration for the Well 385R Pumping Test Project. In addition, other letters of
26 comment on the draft Initial Study/Negative Declaration which addressed the issues raised in this

27 Petition were sent to LADWP by other individuals, entities and organizations. Under the circumstances,
28 Petitioner has exhausted all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
11

INADEQUACY OF REMEDIES

2 44. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law unless this

3 Court grants the requested Writ of Mandate. In the absence of the granting of the requested remedies,
Respondent LADWP's actions described below will remain in effect in violation of CEQA. The
granting of the requested remedies is in the public interest.

6 NOTICE OF PETITION AND STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS
45. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
8 21167.5 by serving written notice of this Petition to Respondents. A copy of this written notice (without
9 the draft copy of this Petition that was attached to the notice) and proof of service are attached as Exhibit

10 A to this Petition.

11 46. As required by Public Resources Code section 21167(a) and CEQA Guideline section

12 15112(c)(5), this action has been brought within 30 days after Respondent LADWP's filing of a Notice

13 of Determination with the Inyo County Clerk.

14 STANDING

15 47. As a signatory of the Water Agreement and as the local government with jurisdiction over
16 groundwater management in the Owens Valley, Petitioner has a beneficial interest in ensuring that

17 Respondents comply with CEQA. Petitioner is adversely affected by Respondent LADWP's failure to

18 comply with CEQA. Moreover, with regard to the Water Agreement, Petitioner is a "responsible

19 agency" under CEQA and, as such, relied on the adequacy of Respondents' 1991 EIR to approve the

20 Water Agreement. For the foregoing reasons, Petitioner has standing to bring this Petition. Petitioner
21 brings this action as a private attorney general under Code of Civil Procedure § 1021.5.

22 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

23 48. This Petition is brought under CEQA and its implementing Guidelines which must be

3 CAUSE OF ACTION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE--VIOLATION OF CEQA

4 49. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 48 inclusive of this

5 Petition as if fully set forth below.

6 50. The approval of the Well 385R Pumping Test Project by the LADWP Board is a violation of
7 CEQA in that the approved project is completely inconsistent with Mitigation Measure 10-12 and with

8 the 1999 Revegetation Plan. Both measures require that W385R not be operated under any
9 circumstances in order to assist in mitigating the significant adverse vegetation impacts in the Five

10 Bridges Impact Area caused by the operation of W385 and W386 in the late 1980s. The need for the

11 continuation of these mitigation measures is especially urgent since the mitigation goals for the

12 significantly impacted vegetation in the Five Bridges area have not been achieved and the Negative

13 Declaration adopted by LADWP admits that the proposed test of W385R will lower the water table in

14 the Five Bridges Impact Area. (See page 2-9 of the Negative Declaration.)

15 51. Although the Negative Declaration adopted by the LADWP Board contains a section
16 titled "Applicable Plans and Policies," the Negative Declaration fails to acknowledge or mention the
17 1999 Revegetation Plan even though the 1999 Revegetation Plan is an adopted mitigation measure as

18 required by the 1997 MOU. The requirement in the 1999 Revegetation Plan that Wells W385 and W386

19 be "permanently shut down" has not been modified or deleted by the LADWP Board. Under the 1999
20 Revegetation Plan, the proposed pump test of W385R cannot take place. Moreover, although the section
21 acknowledges that the operation of W385R is subject to the Water Agreement, it does not explain how a

22 new well can come into existence in the absence of the Technical Group performing its obligations

23 under Water Agreement section VI, to site, evaluate, test, manage and monitor the new well.
24 52. There is a lack of substantial evidence to support the finding in the Negative Declaration

25 on page 1-3 that: "As a temporary data collection project, the pumping test of new W385R (which has
26 fundamentally different functional characteristics from original W385) is not analogous to the original
27 purpose of the well - long term operation of the well for dewatering. Therefore, the proposed pumping

28 test project does not require modification of Mitigation Measure 10-12 of the 1991 EIR." Contrary to the

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
13

statement on page 1-3, on page 1-2, the Negative Declaration acknowledges that the original purposes of

2 W385 are not limited to dewatering. On page 1-2, the Negative Declaration states that the purposes of

3 W385 are: (1) dewatering an adjacent gravel mining operation, (2) supplying water to

4 enhancement/mitigation projects in the Owens Valley and (3) to supplying water for export to Los

5 Angeles. Therefore, with the possible exception of dewatering the adjacent gravel mining operation, the

6 functional characteristics of W385R remain the same as the original functional characteristics of W385.
7 Consequently, there is no substantial evidence to support the finding that Mitigation Measure 10-12 is

8 not applicable (or the implication that the 1999 Revegetation Plan is not applicable) or to support

9 LADWP's conclusion that Mitigation Measure 10-12 does not need to be modified because W385R has
10 functional characteristics different from W385. To the contrary, Mitigation Mcasure 10-12 and the 1999

11 Revegetation Plan must be modified before W385R can be operated.

12 53. There is a lack of substantial evidence to support the finding on page 1-2 of the Negative
13 Declaration that: "[A]s modified, the wells are hydrologically distinct from original W385 and W386;

14 therefore the wells are considered new wells by LADWP and have been renamed W385R and W386R."

15 (Underlining added for emphasis.) Despite the contention in the Negative Declaration, the modification

16 of W385 (and W386) does not convert the wells into "new wells." The existing borchole is in the

17 original location, and the well casing and screen in both wells are the same as installed originally. The

18 modification of the wells does not change the fact that operation of W385R during the proposed test will
19 lower the groundwater level in the Five Bridges Impact Area, nor does it alter the fact that the mitigation

20 goals for the significantly impacted area have not be achieved. If LADWP was certain that the pumping
21 of W385R would not affect the groundwater level in the Five Bridges Impact Area, there would be no
22 need to conduct the proposed test. Mitigation Measure 10-12 requires that W385 and W386 be "turned

23 off and the requirement of the 1999 Revegetation Plan that pumping from W385 and W386 be
24 "permanently shut down" were both designed and adopted to protect the impacted area from the effects
25 of any additional pumping from the wells--whether for the purpose of supplying water or for the purpose
26  of a test.

27 54. LADWP's re-characterization of W385 as a "new well" and a its position with regard to
28 Mitigation Measure 10-12 is analogous to a position that Respondent City took with regard to a

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
14

- mitigation measure that it adopted for a redevelopment project in the Venice Beach area of the City of

2 Los Angeles. In the case of Lincoln Place Tenants Association v City of Los Angeles (2005) 130
3 Cal.App.4th 1491, the Court held that Los Angeles could not disregard the mitigating conditions it

4 placed on the demolition of the buildings by simply declaring that the demolition of the buildings was a

5 "different project" from the original redevelopment project. The court found the distinction drawn by the

6 city and the owners between the "demolition project" and the "redevelopment project," was
7 disingenuous at best. In this regard, the Court stated that:

8 "[U]nder CEQA a "project" is "an activity which may cause either a direct physical
9 change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the

10 environment[ ]" This definition is amplified in the CEQA Guidelines, which define a

11 "project" as "the whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in" a direct or
12 indirect physical change in the environment. Thus, CEQA's requirements "cannot be

13 avoided by chopping up proposed projects into bite-size pieces which, individually
14 considered, might be found to have no significant effect on the environment or to be only

15 ministerial." (Lincoln Place, supra, at page 1507.)

16 The Court continued on page 1509 by noting that:

17 [HJaving placed these conditions on the demolition segment of the redevelopment

18 project, the city cannot simply ignore them. Mitigating conditions are not mere

19 expressions of hope. Section 21002.1, subdivision (b) states: "Each public agency shall
20 mitigate or avoid the significant effects on the environment of projects that it carries out
21 or approves whenever it is feasible to do so." Furthermore, "[a] public agency shall

22 provide that measures to mitigate or avoid significant effects on the environment are fully
23 enforceable through permit conditions, agreements, or other measures." "The purpose of
24 these requirements is to ensure that feasible mitigation measures will actually be

25 implemented as a condition of development, and not merely adopted and then neglected

26 or disregarded."
55. An existing well that is modified does not become a new well in the same way that an 27

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
15

M existing car that is modified does not become a new car. As noted in Paragraph 24, the mitigation

2 measures adopted by LADWP that prohibit the pumping of W385 may be modified or deleted if
those reasons 3 LADWP were to provide a legitimate reason for making the change and were to support
with substantial evidence. If LADWP believes that Mitigation Measure 10-12 and the 1999
5 Revegetation Plan should not apply to the proposed pump test of W385R, instead of attempting to
6 mischaracterize W385 as a new well in its Negative Declaration, the appropriate action would be for
7 LADWP to temporarily modify the mitigation measures and to provide substantial evidence justifying

8 the change in an addendum to the 1991 EIR. (This procedure was explained in Petitioner's letter
9 presenting comments on LADWP's Negative Declaration.)

10 56. LADWP committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion when it re-characterized W385 as a

11 new well. Not only is there a lack of substantial evidence to support LADWP's re-characterization of the
12 well; but also, none of the obligations of the Technical Group, under Water Agreement section VI, to

13 site, evaluate, test, manage and monitor the new well were fulfilled before or after W385 was re-

14 characterized by LADWP as new well; thus LADWP did not proceed in the manner required by law in
15 determining that W385 is a new well. If LADWP were to seek to avoid the Technical Group's
16 obligations concerning a new well, the Water Agreement would have to be amended to modify or delete

17 the Technical Group's obligations. Such an amendment would be a project subject to CEQA.

18 57. Respondents' action in adopting the Negative Declaration constitutes a violation of

19 CEQA in that, by failing to enforce Mitigation Measure 10-12 and the 1999 Revegetation Plan,

20 Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law. Based upon substantial evidence in the

21 record (the failure to enforce Mitigation Measure 10-12 and the 1999 Revegetation Plan), a "fair

22 argument" exists that the project may have a significant impact on the environment. As the California

23 Supreme Court has interpreted CEQA, the purpose of CEQA is to "…afford the fullest possible

24 protection to the environment..." See Friends of Mammoth v Board of Supervisors (1972) 8 Cal 3d 247,
25 259. Such protection of the environment will not be afforded if LADWP is allowed to conduct the pump

26 test of W385 in violation of CEQA.
