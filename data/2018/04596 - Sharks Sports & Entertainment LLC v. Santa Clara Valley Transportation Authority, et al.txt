25 INTRODUCTION

26 1. Sharks Sports & Entertainment LLC ("SSE") brings this action against the Santa
27 Clara Valley Transportation Authority ("VTA") in connection with VTA's approval of the Bay
28 Area Rapid Transit ("BART") extension into downtown San Jose. Because VTA is so biased in

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

10517568.DOC EXHIBIT

favor of its own transportation systems, it refused to consider studies or conduct studies that

2 might challenge the agency's biases. By forcing its analysis under the California Environmental

3 Quality Act ("CEQA") to support its preconceived notions, VTA ignored the very purpose of

4 CEQA, which is to fairly evaluate environmental conditions and impacts. VTA also chose to

5 save costs by refusing to bind itself to construction mitigations that are effective, enforceable,

6 measurable, and monitored, as required by law. VTA's failure to mitigate adverse
7 environmental impacts unlawfully foists the burdens of VTA's project onto the neighbors of

8 BART's new facilities.

9 2. VTA's BART Silicon Valley Program consists of the extension of the BART

10 system from Fremont into Santa Clara County through Milpitas, San Jose, and Santa Clara. The

11 BART Silicon Valley Program is being implemented in two phases: The Phase I Berryessa

12 Extension Project and the Phase II Extension Project. The Phase I Project to Berryessa is not yet

13 completed and is now tentatively rescheduled to become operational in 2018.

14 3. The remaining approximately 6 miles of the BART Silicon Valley Program is

15 called VTA's BART Silicon Valley Phase II Extension Project (*Phase Il Project" or "Project").

16 The Phase II Project consists of the extension of the BART system from the Berryessa/North

17 San Jose Station through downtown San Jose in an approximately 5-mile-long tunnel, mostly

18 under Santa Clara Street, terminating near the Santa Clara Caltrain Station.

19 4. The most important planned station on the Phase II Project route is the BART

20 Diridon Station, which will interconnect several transit modes, including: BART, Caltrain, light

21 rail, the bus system, vehicles, the Altamont Express, Amtrak (Capitol Corridor and Coast

22 Starlight), and the planned High Speed Rail (*HSR"). Diridon is Station is projected to be the

23 biggest intermodal station in the West.

24 5. The SAP Center ("Arena") is an 18,000-seat regional multipurpose event center

25 located adjacent to the planned BART Diridon Station. With over 170 events per year, the

26 Arena is one of San Jose's most consistent and impactful economic catalysts and a critical asset
27 to the City's economic success. The Arena's operations support over 5,000 full time equivalent

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

10517568.DOC

n

jobs, generate more than $250 million in annual economic impact, and provide millions of

2 dollars in revenue for San Jose.

6. As a regional event center, the Arena attracts more than 1.5 million people to San
4. Jose's downtown area every year, drawing diverse crowd from throughout Santa Clara, San

5 Mateo, Santa Cruz and Alameda counties, and beyond. The region from which the Arena draws

6 is primarily suburban, and mass transit is not a viable option for the majority of the Arena's

7 patrons. Accordingly, the Arena is reliant on a large supply of convenient parking nearby, as
8 well as highly functional and efficient ingress and egress from all modes of transit. One of the

9 reasons the Arena was built in its present location is because of its excellent access to major

10 highways and large surface streets.

11 7. Automobile transport is the primary means of transportation in the South Bay,

12 which includes the counties of Santa Clara, San Mateo, Santa Cruz, and Alameda. In fact, the

13 2040 San Jose General Plan predicts that more than 20 years from now, 60% of all trips will

14 still be by automobile. After approximately 20 years of light rail operation, the use of light rail
15 to attend Arena events is trivial. Surveys also show that travel by Caltrain for Arena events is
16 similarly insignificant. Experience shows that past predictions of mass transit use for Arena
17 events have been grossly overestimated.

18 8. The Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement/Subsequent

19 Environmental Impact Report and Draft Section 4(f) Evaluation, dated February 2018 ("Final
20 SEIS/SEIR") for the BART Silicon Valley Phase II Extension Project is a joint environmental
21 document that attempts compliance with both the federal National Environmental Protection

22 Act ("NEPA") by virtue of the Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement ("SEIS") parts of
23 the document, and the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") by virtue of the

24 Subsequent Environmental Impact Report ("SEIR") parts of the document. The purpose of

25 CEQA is to provide the decision-makers and the public with detailed information about a
26 proposed project's likely effects on the environment, to list the ways significant adverse effects

27 of the project can be mitigated, and to identify alternatives to the project. See Pub. Res. C.
28 §§ 21001, 21002.1, 210 Title 14 CCR § 15362.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

10517568.DOC

1 9. VTA is using this Final SEIS/SEIR to renege on prior commitments to mitigate

2 parking that have been part of the Silicon Valley BART Extension going back to, at least, the

3 2004 Final EIR for the 16-mile project, the 2010 Final EIS, and the 2011 Final 2nd

4 Supplemental EIR. All of these previous environmental documents have relied upon actual,

5 competent studies demonstrating that the BART Diridon Station was going to be a huge parking

6 draw and that it would, absent mitigation, cause significant direct and indirect adverse
7  environmental impacts throughout the downtown and Diridon areas. Not only would there be

8 huge spillover parking problems, but there would also be significant safety, access, and
9 pollution issues that would negatively impact pedestrians, drivers, bicyclists, and businesses.

10 These prior environmental documents culminated in the proposal to construct an 8-story, 1,300

11 space parking garage at BART Diridon Station, in order to provide critical (albeit only partial)

12 mitigation of adverse impacts caused by the BART Project.

13 10. In 2016, VTA released a Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact
14 Statement/Subsequent Environmental Impact Report ("Draft SEIS/SEIR") that - without the

15 benefit of any parking studies - eliminated all long-term parking mitigation, including the

16 promised 8-story garage, a required part of the Project. After the close of the CEQA public
17 comment period on the Draft SEIS/SEIR, VTA concluded that it lacked sufficient information

18 about the parking situation (since it had conducted no studies that would support its new

19 position) and undertook a parking inventory that merely counted parking spaces throughout the

20 downtown and Diridon Station areas. This minimal inventory work did not meet any
21 traffic/parking engineering standard for studying the anticipated issues that the Project would

22 cause related to parking demand, parking-related traffic, safety, and pollution. It did not account

23 for multiple factors that substantially reduce the number of parking spaces actually available for

24 public use, including: spaces that are reserved for particular users, spaces that are occupied by
25 other users, and spaces in facilities that are not available for general public parking. Many of the
26 on-street spaces cited in the survey are in permit only residential parking areas, where the

27 general public cannot park. In short, the parking inventory undertaken is not a scientific parking

28 study and does not meet the standard for adequacy under CEQA.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

10517568.DOC

11. Critically, on top of not accounting for or mitigating the long-term parking

2 impacts caused by the Phase II Project, VTA plans to permanently eliminate 715 existing
parking spaces in the Diridon Station area, which spaces are already required and fully utilized

4 by the patrons and employees of the Arena and other Diridon Station area businesses. The Final
SEIS/SEIR does not provide for any replacement of those spaces.

12. The unmitigated interim adverse impacts that will arise during construction of

7 II the Phase II Project are enormously significant. VTA has estimated that the construction of the

8 Phase II Project will take years; however, VTA's performance on the Phase portion of the

9 project has been plagued by substantial delays, indicating that the Phase II Project will take

10 much longer than estimated by VTA. Accordingly, the downtown and Diridon Station areas will
11 likely be impacted for at least a decade. Unmitigated interim/construction impacts will have

12 serious effects on downtown businesses, including the Arena.

13 13. Construction of the Phase II Project will interfere with access to the Diridon

14 Station area, including access into the Arena itself. For example, if trucks are marshaled on

15 Autumn Strect, a logical location, the Arena would be blocked on two sides and its main

16 entrance blocked entirely - a fact not disclosed in the Final SEIS/SEIR. For other big
17 infrastructure projects in California, the environmental planning documents have included well-

18 documented and enforceable mitigation plans. However, for the Phase II Project, the Final

19 SEIS/SEIR provides only inadequate, vague promises of future disclosure and future planning

20 for mitigation.

21 14. The essential purpose of an environmental impact report is to give the public and
22 governmental agencies the information needed to make informed decisions, thus protecting not

23 only the environment but also informed self-government. Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of

24 Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564. "The purpose of CEQA is not to generate paper, but to

25 compel government at all levels to make decisions with environmental consequences in mind.

26 CEQA does not, indeed cannot, guarantee that these decisions will always be those which favor

27 environmental considerations. At the very least, however, the People have right to expect that

28 those who must decide will approach their task neutrally, with no parochial interest at stake."

3 15. SSE therefore requests issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate setting aside

4 VTA's decisions on April 5, 2018 (1) certifying and approving the Final SEIS/SEIR for the

5 Project, (2) approving the Project, and (3) approving other related environmental documents.

6 PARTIES

16. Petitioner SSE is a Delaware limited liability company. Through its subsidiary
(San Jose Sharks, LLC), SSE owns and operates the San Jose Sharks professional ice hockey
9 team, a member of the National Hockey League. SSE is also the parent company of San is Jose

10 Arena Management, LLC, the manager of the SAP Center, which is located in downtown San

11 Jose adjacent to BART's planned Diridon Station that will be under Santa Clara Street.

12 17. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that Respondent

13 VTA is a local government agency charged with planning and implementing transportation and

14 transit development within its territory in compliance with CEQA.

15 18. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that the Federal

16 Transit Administration ("FTA"), identified as a Real Party in Interest, is a federal government

17 agency charged with the authority for planning and implementing new transit infrastructure or

18 improvements to existing infrastructure. FTA is the lead agency for the Project with regard to

19 NEPA, is charged with the duty of ensuring the Project's compliance with applicable federal

20 laws and as such has an interest in the Project. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that
21 basis alleges that the FTA has not yet taken final approval action for the Project.

22 19. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that the San

23 Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District is a special purpose rapid transit district organized
24 under the laws of the State of California operating a fixed route system of public transportation.

25 The Project is designed to integrate with the BART system. The BART Board of Directors
26 approved the Project, accepted the Final SEIS/SEIR and adopted the VTA's Findings and

27 Statement of Overriding Considerations for the SEIR during its meeting on April 26, 2018.

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

10517568.DOC

1 20. Petitioner is currently unaware of the true names and capacities of DOES 1

2 through 50, inclusive, and therefore sues those parties by such fictitious names. DOES

3 through 20, inclusive, are the agents of Respondent, the state, county, city, or federal

4 government who are responsible in some manner for the Project. DOES 21-50, inclusive are

5 persons or entities presently unknown to Petitioner who have or claim some legal or equitable

6 interest or other responsibility in or for the Project.

7 21. Petitioner is directly or beneficially interested in VTA's decisions with respect to

8 the Phase II Project.

C HISTORY OF THE PUBLIC PROCESS

10 22. On January 30, 2015, VTA issued a Notice of Preparation ("NOP") to initiate

11 preparation of a Supplemental EIR for the Phase II Project. The NOP diverged from prior

12 environmental planning documents dating back to at least 2004, by eliminating the BART

13 Diridon Station 8-story parking garage mitigation in its project description. No justification for

14 the elimination of the mitigation was disclosed in the NOP, and no study, official change in

15 policy, or change in the physical conditions between 2011 and 2015 justified its elimination.

16 23. In December 2016, VTA released the Draft SEIS/SEIR. A formal public

17 comment period followed the release, during which Petitioner submitted a comment letter

18 raising concerns about numerous issues and impacts, including the lack of any study justifying

19 the elimination of long-term parking mitigation, the inadequate interim parking disclosure and

20 mitigation, the lack of adequate disclosure and mitigation for construction impacts, and the

21 failure to include a legally sufficient Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program ("MMRP").

22 24. Similarly, during the comment period, the City of San Jose submitted a letter

23 raising concerns about numerous issues and impacts, including the elimination of long-term

24 parking mitigation, the inadequate interim parking mitigation, the lack of study of indirect

25 impacts caused by the failure to provide adequate interim and long-term parking, the lack of
26 adequate mitigation for construction impacts, and the failure to include a legally sufficient
27 MMRP.

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

10517568.DOC

25. In February 2018, VTA released the Final SEIS/SEIR, which did not contain a

2 legally sufficient MMRP. On April 2, 2018, SSE submitted another comment letter, which
attached samples of legally sufficient MMRPs prepared for FTA rail extension subway projects

4 located in Los Angeles. Those legally sufficient MMRPs, which were included as part of the
final environmental review documents for those projects, demonstrate that VTA can and should

6 have prepared effective, enforceable, and measurable mitigation plans along with the Final

7 SEIS/SEIR, so that decision-makers and the public could have evaluated such plans in a

8 meaningful way. By contrast, VTA is violating CEQA standard practice by proposing only
vague, unenforceable mitigation measures for the Phase II Project, and deferring disclosure of

10 such proposed measures until the time for meaningful review by the VTA Board, the public and

11 the courts has expired.

12 26. The Phase II project has been beset by long-running disputes that prevented the

13 drafting of a CEQA compliant project description or, indeed, any project description. The most

14 prominent deferred decision was on whether to open up the length of Santa Clara Street for a

15 massive cut-and-cover, So that two separate tubes could be emplaced for the BART trains, or to

16 use tunneling techniques. Between the Draft and Final SEIS/SEIRs, studies were undertaken to

17 try and resolve these disputes. During that time several VTA Board members were even sent to

18 Barcelona, Spain to observe its subway system. The failure to resolve these disputes in a timely

19 fashion meant that no one really knew what the Project did or would entail. The difference in

20 construction impacts between cut-and-cover and tunneling is enormous. Accordingly, the
21 adequacy of proposed mitigation could not be evaluated because the impacts to be mitigated

22 were unknown. At the time of the drafting of the Final SEIS/SEIR, some station locations and

23 alignments remained undecided. In fact, the decision to tunnel was not taken until after BART's

24 General Manager issued a letter on March 28, 2018, supporting the tunneling option - long after

25 the Final SEIS/SEIR had been finalized and published.

26 27. On April 5, 2018, the VTA Board certified the Final SEIS/SEIR and approved

27 the Phase II Project. Despite receiving detailed comment letters and evidence describing the

28 severe deficiencies in the Final SEIS/SEIR, the VTA Board chose not to mitigate the long-term,

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
8
10517568.DOC

BART-caused direct and indirect parking impacts at Diridon Station (or even to study the

2 issue); not to adequately study or mitigate the direct and indirect interim parking impacts; not to
adequately study and disclose the construction impacts; not to provide effective, measurable,

4 and enforceable mitigations; and not to require inclusion of a legally sufficient MMRP..

5 28. At the April 5, 2018 hearing, the VTA Board approved the Transit-Oriented Joint
6 Development (*TOJD") alternative. TOJD involves VTA working with private developers to

7 develop mixed-use developments consistent with California Public Utilities Code. The Public

8 Utilities Code defines TOJD as a commercial, residential, or mixed-use development
9 undertaken in connection with existing, planned, or proposed transit facilities and located 1/4

10 mile or less from the external boundaries of that facility. There appear to be a total of six TOJDs

11 that are part of this Project. They have been added to virtually every location where there is

12 significant BART facility.

13 29. A Notice of Determination for the April 5, 2018 approval by VTA was filed with

14 the Santa Clara County Clerk on April 6, 2018, but was not posted as required by law.

15 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

16 30. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to

17 Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085 and 1094.5 and Public Resources Code §§ 21168, 21168.5,

18 and 21168.9.

19 31. The Project is proposed for construction in Santa Clara County, and Respondents

20 approved the Project in Santa Clara County, As such, venue is proper in this Court because the
21 causes of action alleged in this Petition arose in Santa Clara County.

22 32. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code

23 § 21167.5 by serving a written notice of Petitioner's intention to commence this action on

24 Respondents on April 25, 2018 and on San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District on April

25 30, 2018. A copy of these written notices and proofs of service are attached as Exhibit A to this

26 Petition.

27 33. Petitioner is complying with the requirements of Public Resources Code

28 § 21167.6(a) by concurrently filing and serving a notice that it is requesting the public agency

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
9
10517568.DOC

-

2 prepare the record of proceedings. A copy of this written notice and proof of service is attached is

hereto as Exhibit B.

3 34.

4 Petitioner is sending a copy of this Petition to the California Attorney General

5 concurrently with this filing, thereby complying with the requirements of Public Resources

6 Code § 21167.7. A copy of this written notice with proof of service is attached hereto as
Exhibit C.

7 35.

8 Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this action and

9 has exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.
36.

10 Petitioner requests a hearing within 90 days from the date of the filing of this
Petition, in accordance with Pub. Res. C § 21167.4(a).
11 37.

12 This action is brought to enforce important public policies with respect to

13 protection of the environment under CEQA and will confer a substantial benefit on the public

14 by protecting it from environmental harm. SSE acts as a private attorney general to enforce
these public policies and prevent such harm.

15 38.

16 Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

17 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate, requiring Respondents to set aside their

18 approval of the Project. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' approval will remain in
violation of State law.

19 STATEMENT OF FACTS

20 The Approved Alternative

21 39.

22 The Phase II Project is likely the largest public project ever approved in the City

23 a of San Jose's downtown. It is a massive project with significant impacts that will disrupt the

24 core of san Jose. It consists of an approximately 6-mile extension of the BART system from the

25 Berryessa/North San Jose Station through downtown San Jose in an approximately 5-mile-long

26 tunnel, terminating near the Santa Clara Caltrain Station. Two BART lines are planned to serve

27 the Phase II Project: Santa Clara-Richmond and Santa Clara-Daly City.

40.

28 The Phase II Project tunnel starts from east of U.S. 101, south of Mabury Road,
and enters the East Tunnel Portal near Las Plumas Avenue. It passes beneath North Marburg

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

10517568.DOC 10

-

2 Way, then 30 feet below the creek bed of Lower Silver Creek, curves under U.S. 101, and enters
the Alum Rock/28th Street Station.

3 41.

4 Alum Rock/28th Street Station will be located between U.S. 101 and North 28th

5 Street. A parking structure of up to 7 levels 7 would accommodate BART park-and-ride demand

6 with 1,200 parking spaces. Areas for automobiles, shuttles, and buses to drop off passengers

7 will be provided on North 28th Street and/or within the station campus.

42.

8 A TOJD would be located within the Alum Rock station campus and consist of a
maximum of 500,000 square feet of office space with approximately 1,650 parking spaces,
9 20,000 square feet of retail with 100 parking spaces, and up to 275 dwelling units with
10 approximately 400 parking spaces. The TOJD would range

11 from 4 to 9 stories within the station

12 area. Design of the TOJD is supposed to be coordinated with parking provided for BART in that

area.

13 43.

14 From Alum Rock/28th Street Station, the line curves under North 28th Street
before aligning under Santa Clara Street.

15 44.

16 The Downtown San Jose Station would be located beneath Santa Clara Street

17 between Market and 3rd Streets. No parking will be provided at the Downtown Station. The line

18 remains beneath Santa Clara Street and continues west 45 feet below the riverbed of the
Guadalupe River and 40 feet below the creek bed of Los Gatos Creek.

19 45.

20 Diridon Station will be located between Autumn Street to the east, White Street
to the west, Santa Clara Street to the north, and West San Fernando Street to the south. The
21 underground station platforms would be located directly under Santa Clara Street and adjacent

22

23 to the Arena. No BART parking will be provided at Diridon Station. The existing VTA bus

24 transit center would be reconfigured to accommodate projected bus and shuttle transfers to and
from the BART station.

25 46.

26 Another TOJD would be located adjacent to Diridon Station and would consist

27 of a maximum of 640,000 square feet of office space and 72,000 square feet of retail. The TOJD

28 would be approximately eight levels high and have only three levels of underground parking,
with approximately 400 parking spaces to service the TOJD.

47. The line continues west from Diridon Station under Santa Clara Street/The

2 Alameda and turns north under West Julian Street before aligning under Stockton Avenue. The

3 line continues north under the Caltrain tracks and Hedding Street. It continues on the east side

4 of the Caltrain tracks and crosses under Interstate 880 before exiting at the West Tunnel Portal

5 near Newhall Street.

48. A third TOJD would be located on the east side of Stockton Avenue, south of
Taylor Street, with the ventilation structure at the rear of the site. The development would

8 consist of a maximum of 15,000 square feet of ground level retail along the street frontage
9 facing Stockton Avenue.

10 49. The BART Extension in Santa Clara includes the Newhall Maintenance Facility,

11 which is approximately 40 acres. A parking structure of up to five levels would be located

12 north of Brokaw Road and east of the Caltrain tracks to serve the Santa Clara Station within the

13 approximately 10-acre station campus area and would accommodate 500 BART park-and-ride

14 parking spaces in addition to public facilities on the site.

15 50. Systems facilities throughout the route would be located above- and underground

16 and include Traction Power Substations and Sectionalizing Stations, auxiliary power

17 substations, ventilation facilities, and Train Control and Communication Equipment. The

18 stations and line would also include emergency exhaust ventilation facilities with ventilation

19 shafts and fresh air intake/exhaust hatches. Large new High-Voltage Substations and Switching

20 Stations will be required.

21 / Construction Impacts

22 51. The construction impact mitigation measures lack specificity and fail to commit

23 VTA to a specific course of action that will reduce significant impacts. Without adequate detail

24 of the construction impacts, it is impossible to determine if the mitigation measures are

25 adequate. Without a description of the mitigation measures, in turn, it is impossible to determine

26 what other environmental impacts the mitigation measures might trigger.

27 52. The Phase II Project will cause street, trail, and transit service closures and

28 necessitate the use of alternative transportation routes. Truck haul routes and marshalling areas

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
12
10517568.DOC

1 will be heavy disruptors of access in the downtown and Diridon Station area. Nevertheless, the

2 Final SEIS/SEIR provides no specificity on how this will be managed.

3 53. In the already heavily impacted Diridon Station area, impacts caused by

4 construction worker parking have not been adequately disclosed, analyzed, or mitigated. The

5 Final SEIS/SEIR says only that construction worker parking will be accommodated in the

6 construction staging area or other designated locations. No reference is made to the expected

7 number of construction worker vehicles that will be parked in the Diridon area, the portion that

8 will be parked in designated locations outside the construction staging area, the locations of

9 those designated areas, or negative impacts caused by construction worker parking in those

10 locations. No mitigation measures to avoid these significant negative impacts are discussed.

11 This construction impact should be fully analyzed, disclosed and mitigated.

12 54. The truck haul routes depicted on Figure 5-12 of the Final SEIS/SEIR are located
13 in Chapter 5: NEPA Alternatives Analysis of Construction (rather than in Chapter 6: CEQA

14 Alternatives Analysis of Construction and Operation. Those routes show trucks traveling in

15 front of the Arena on Santa Clara Street. They are expected to access Santa Clara Street from

16 Autumn and Montgomery Streets as they apparently travel to and from Interstate 280 to the
17 south. These trucks would be expected to affect traffic and roadway conditions in the area, yet

18 specific mitigation measures to be included in the individual Construction Traffic Control

19 Plans ("CTCP") at this "major project element" location are not described (see pages 5-84 of

20 the Final SEIS/SEIR). The area across Santa Clara Street from the Arena is described as a

21 "Construction Staging Area" where materials will be stockpiled, yet no information is provided

22 about how construction equipment will access this staging area or how pedestrians will be

23 guided through the area during its active use.

24 55. The CTCPs are expected to include signage, notifications, maps, and schedules.

25 However, specific mitigation measures in accordance with standards promulgated by the Bay

26 Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) and City of San Jose General Plan policies

27 MS-10.1 and 13.1 (which are always expected to be included in proposed projects of this type,

28 even those of significantly lesser scale) are not included. Examples of these types of mitigation

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
13
10517568.DOC

measures include but are not limited to (1) watering exposed surfaces (e.g., parking areas,

2 staging areas, soil piles, graded areas, and unpaved access roads) twice per day; (2) covering

3 all haul trucks transporting soil, sand, or other loose materials; (3) removing all visible mud or

4 dirt tracked out of construction areas using wet power vacuum street sweepers at least once per

5 day; (4) limiting all vehicle speeds on paved and unpaved roads; (5) minimizing idling times of

6 construction equipment; (6) shielding sensitive uses from construction equipment with the use

7 of barriers, etc.; (7) maintaining and tuning all construction equipment, including haul trucks,

8 according to all manufacturer's specifications; (8) limiting hours of construction; (9) locating
staging areas as far away as possible from adjacent land uses; and (10) employing flag persons

10 to control construction vehicle access and traffic and maintain pedestrian safety in the project

11 area. Again, these types of specific, universally employed mitigation measures are not included

12 in either Chapter 6 or the CTCPs described in Chapter 5 of the Final SEIS/SEIR. The hauling

13 and storage of construction materials in front of the Arena would significantly affect Arena

14 operations, access, and patrons, as well as the residential areas within the Diridon Station area.

15 The fact that this impact is not described is a significant flaw for a purportedly project-level

16 environmental document under CEQA.

17 Arena Specific Impacts

18 56. SSE was a major contributor to Measure B, which is providing funding for the

19 Phase II Project. SSE did so with the clear understanding, for more than a decade, that the a

20 BART Diridon Station would include a parking garage and would not dramatically disrupt

21 traffic operations and pedestrian flow on Santa Clara Street. Nonetheless, as shown in the Final

22 SEIS/SEIR, there are no longer any plans to provide parking for the BART Diridon Station,

23 and it is obvious that Santa Clara Street in front of the Arena will be disrupted for years.

24 57. It is also obvious that the Arena, as well as nearby bars and restaurants (e.g., San

25 Pedro Square) that depend on event center activities to support their own businesses, will be
26 severely impacted by these unmitigated traffic disruptions. Unlike commuters, who when faced

27 with transportation challenges tend to persevere in order to reach their home or place of

28 employment, entertainment-goers are far less inclined to tolerate poor access. The Final

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
14
10517568.DOC

SEIS/SEIR ignores the fact that, unlike commuters, arena-goers have the option to take their

2 entertainment dollars elsewhere, including other event centers in the San Francisco Bay Area
which provide choices for customers if access to the Arena is impacted.

4 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

5 (Failure to comply with CEQA)

6 58. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates the allegations set forth in each of

7 the paragraphs above.

8 59. VTA's certification of the Final SEIS/SEIR and approval of the Project violated

9 CEQA in at least the following ways:

10 60. Inadequate Project Description. There is no stable or even decipherable project

11 description in the Final SEIS/SEIR. In numerous locations, the VTA and the FTA state that the

12 project description can be found in the Executive Summary and multiple other sections of the

13 document. However, no single section of the document provides a project description as

14 required by CEQA. Following circulation and the close of public comment on the Final

15 SEIS/SEIR, the VTA Board approved a Recommended Project Description that constituted 23

16 pages of the Board's packet, which itself appears to have been cobbled together from various

17 options and alternatives presented previously. This is a tacit admission that there was no

18 Project Description that was included in either the Draft or Final SEIS/SEIR, as required by

19 CEQA. Rather, there was only a Recommended Project Description/Locally Preferred

20 Alternatives section that consisted mostly of options and alternatives. CEQA requires a stable

21 and consistent project description at the start of the environmental analysis. By failing to

22 proceed with a definite, stable project description and then failing to circulate that stable

23 description in the Draft and Final SEIS/SEIR, VTA committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion

24 for which the Project approvals must be set aside. Sacramento Old City Assn. v. City Council

25 (1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 1011, 1023; [An accurate description of the proposed project is "the

26 heart of the EIR process," is and is necessary for an intelligent evaluation of the potential

27 environmental effects of a proposed activity]; McQueen v. Board of Directors (1988) 202

2 ['"An accurate, stable and finite project description is the sine qua non of an informative and

3 legally sufficient EIR"]. Additional legal deficiencies in the Project Description include the

4 following:

5 60.1. On page ES-2, the Final SEIS/SEIR states that the CEQA alternatives are

6 1) the No Build Alternative; 2) the CEQA BART Extension Alternative; and 3) the

7 CEQA BART Extension with TOJD Alternative. CEQA requires that an EIR evaluate

8 a project with a meaningful project description, and then evaluate alternatives that would

9 reduce potential environmental impacts. Characterizing the alternatives as a "project
10 description" does not meet this CEQA requirement.
11 60.2. CEQA requires a complete and stable project description that contains a

12 full statement of objectives, not just those related to the TOJD projects included in

13 Section 1.3 of the Final SEIS/SEIR. Title 14 CCR §15124(b). The TOJD development
14 is a consequence of the Phase II Project and serves a complementary purpose, not an

15 independent purpose. The Phase II Project is a necessary element of the TOJD Project,

16 because it cannot be implemented without the Phase II Project, and thus there is no

17 independent justification for the TOJD absent the Phase II Project. Accordingly, the
18 Project Description needed to include the entire Phase II Project - including the TOJD

19 with its full complement of objectives. A crabbed project description and objectives

20 unlawfully restricts any analysis of alternatives and mitigations,
21 60.3. The TOJD Project Objectives at section 1.3 of the Final SEIS/SEIR do

22 not comply with Title 14 CCR §15124. Furthermore, Project Objectives are not the
23 same as a project's purpose, and referring to the purposes of a project, instead of
24 articulating clear objectives, violates CEQA.

25 60.4. Throughout the document the drafters state that the project has not yet

26 been developed to the level of detail needed to include specific mitigation measures.

27 However, CEQA requires that a project description supply the amount of information
28 needed for evaluation and review of the environmental impacts. Title 14 CCR §15124.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
I6
10517568.DOC

The Final SEIS/SEIR "CEQA project" focuses on the TOJD projects. However, these
2 can only be considered program-level projects in terms of the detail provided - clearly

3 insufficient for what purports to be a project-level SEIR.

4 60.5. As the City of San Jose pointed out, "[t]he Project Description in the
SEIS/SEIR is insufficient under CEQA for environmental impact analysis needed for

6 TOJD entitlements from the City. The City will need to determine what, if any,

7 subsequent environmental analysis would be required when additional project details

8 become available. Likewise, the City stated it cannot make a final determination of
9 TOJD General Plan, specific plan, municipal code or policy conformance until more

10 project specific details are available. General Plan conformance is based on the entirety
11 of the General Plan goals and policies and not solely the Land Use/Transportation

12 Diagram designation." (San Jose Comment Letter March 6, 2017 pp 4-5) This confirms
13 that the project description is inadequate for its stated purpose.

14 60.6. The VTA does not acknowledge anywhere in the Final SEIS/SEIR that

15 additional environmental review may be required for the TOJD, which it admits has not

16 been designed to a project level. The VTA merely defers to the City to make the

17 determination. However, based on the City's comment above, the VTA must

18 acknowledge that the Phase II Project is not adequately described for CEQA purposes

19 nor, with the many changes and decisions yet to be made, is the description stable, as

20 required by CEQA.

21 60.7. Due to the inability of VTA and the City to agree on the project (i.e., cut-

22 and-cover versus tunneling) VTA relied on an incomplete, inadequate, and unstable

23 project description that violates CEQA's requirement for a meaningful draft with a

24 stable project description, followed by a meaningful comment period on that draft, and
25 concluding with a response to those comments in the Final SEIS/SEIR. VTA released

26 its Draft SEIS/SEIR too early in the process, before the analysis and decisions had been

27 taken and VTA could establish a valid project description. Title 14 CCR §15005(b)

28 [requiring that EIR be prepared "late enough to provide meaningful information for

P

2 • environmental assessment"]; Title 14 CCR §15082(a)(L) [requiring, at a minimum,

3 project information must include the "location of the project"].

4 60.8. By failing to postpone its decision until the Project could be accurately

5 described, VTA committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion for which the Project

6 approvals must be set aside. Title 14 CCR §15126.6, subd. (d) [An EIR must provide

7 sufficient information for meaningful evaluations of the comparative merits of the

8 proposed project and each alternative); Cal. Code Regs., Title 14, §15144; Sunnyvale

9 West Neighborhood Assn. v. City of Sunnyvale City Council (2010) 190 Cal.App.4th

10 1351, 1352 [*Drafting an EIR ... necessarily involves some degree of forecasting," and

11 "an agency must use its best efforts to find out and disclose all that is reasonably-can"];

12 Id. at 1386 [Under CEQA, the lead agency must not decide issues without the data

13 necessary to make an informed assessment of the environmental impact of the proposed

14 project]; Sierra Club y. State Bd. Of Forestry (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1215, 1220-1221 [Under

15 CEQA, the lead agency must not decide issues without the data necessary to make an

16 informed assessment of the cnvironmental impact of the proposed project].

17 60.9. As confirmed by VTA's own actions in deferring the critical project

18 decisions and commissioning additional studies, including a parking inventory and

19 tunneling studies, the Draft SEIS/SEIR failed to provide sufficient information for

20 meaningful evaluation of the comparative merits of the proposed project and each

21 alternative. Title 14 CCR § 15126.6(d). Because of this premature Draft SEIS/SEIR,

22 CEQA required VTA to either (a) issue and circulate a Supplement Draft SEIS/SEIR

23 describing and analyzing the new scientific data and definite course of action, or (b)

24 issue subsequent EIS/EIR. Title 14 CCR §§ 15162, 15163. Instead, VTA pushed on
with a deficient Final SEIS/SEIR.

25

26 60.10. VTA could not simply defer the decision on the project description

27 pending receipt of the significant and necessary information. By failing to recirculate

28 the new environmental analysis for public comment in one form or another (i.e.,
Supplemental Draft EIR or Subsequent Draft EIR), VTA committed a prejudicial abuse

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

10517568.DOC 18

of discretion for which the Project approvals must be set aside. Cal. Pub. Res. Code o

2 21166 [A subsequent or supplemental EIR is required where there is new information
W which was not known and could not have been known at the time the environmental

v 1nvo N impact report was certified as complete, where there is a substantial change to the
project, or where the circumstances underlying the project have significantly changed];
Title 14 CCR § 15162(a)(1) & (2); River Valley Preservation Project v. Metropolitan
Transit Development Bd. (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 154, 167 [A supplemental EIR is

8 prepared under section 21166 where it is necessary to explore the environmental

9 ramifications of a substantial change not considered in the original EIRJ; Fund for

10 Environmental Defense v. County of Orange (1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 1538, 1544

11 [Where circumstances have changed significantly, a supplemental EIR is required].

12 61. Inaccurate Baseline. An EIR must describe the existing environmental

13 conditions as the starting point for any environmental analysis. The CEQA Guidelines specify

14 that the baseline is set as of the is publication of the Notice of Preparation ("NOP"), which in this

15 case was January 30, 2015. On that date, BART's adopted policy was to provide expansion

16 projects with sufficient parking to meet the demand expected to be generated by the projects.

17 Failure to do so would be a direct adverse environmental impact to transportation and, by

18 reducing access, would in turn reduce ridership and, indirectly, reduce the associated

19 environmental benefits of the projects.

20 61.1. In its comment letter to the Draft SEIS/SEIR, SSE pointed out that not

21 providing for the parking demand that had been projected at Diridon Station by

22 numerous studies over many years violated BART policy. In response, VTA did not

23 point to any evidence in the record supporting the removal of Diridon Station's long-

24 term parking, nor can it as no such evidence exists. VTA claimed instead that BART

25 policy changed on June 9, 2016. (Response to comment, pp. 84-32.). However, June 9,

26 2016 was 5 months after the NOP set the baseline condition. Thus, the applicable

27 conditions and the policies were those in place on January 30, 2015. VTA's

28 justification for its elimination is therefore based solely on an after-the-fact change in

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
19
10517568.DOC

1 BART policy.

2 61.2. BART's after-the-fact policy to discriminate against auto-parking does

3 not justify VTA's refusal to study or mitigate the impacts its Project will cause.

4 62. Failure to Present a Neutral and Unbiased Environmental Document, CEQA
un requires that an EIR provide a reasonable good-faith disclosure of environmental impacts.

6 Information should be presented allowing decision-makers and the public to understand the

7 environmental consequences of the project. "At the very least, . . . the People have a right to

8 expect that those who must decide will approach their task neutrally, with no parochial interest

9 at stake." Bonzung v. Local Agency Formation Commission of Ventura County (1995) 13

10 Cal.3d 263, 283. Here the VTA it chose the result it desired and issued an NOP removing the

11 Diridon Station's long-term parking mitigation without any study or evidence supporting that

12 decision. VTA then refused to undertake any studies to fairly evaluate the consequence of this

13 decision.

14 62.1. Biased analysis is also evident in the failure to adequately disclose and

15 mitigate the construction impacts. VTA has a long history of failing to fully consider

16 the disruptive and damaging impacts of its construction projects on the San Jose

17 community. VTA's failures to undertake an unbiased and good-faith analysis of

18 foreseeable impacts in accordance with CEQA, and to provide adequate mitigation,

19 resulted in major economic damage to San Jose's downtown businesses during the

20 construction of the downtown transit mall. The businesses on Alum Rock Avenue

21 similarly suffered due to VTA's failures during construction of its Bus Rapid Transit

22 (BRT).

23 62.2. The Final SEIS/SEIR improperly manipulated the travel demand model

24 by treating the Diridon Station as an urban station, in complete disregard of its actual

25 physical location and setting. The Diridon Station is surrounded by parking lots and has

26 an over 80-year history as an origination station for commuters going north and east by

27 commuter trains and Amtrak. Comparing the results of no-BART parking at the Diridon

28 Station to results presented in the 2010 BART Final EIS confirms the misuse of the

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
20
10517568.DOC

-

2 travel demand model. Table 3-23 in that document states that BART parking demand at

3 the Diridon Station will be 1,610 vehicles in the opening year and 2,585 vehicles in

4 2030. This manipulation of the model, specifically recording no parking at the Diridon

5 Station as an input parameter, prevented the true parking demand from being disclosed
and analyzed.

6

7 62.3. The Final SEIS/SEIR states, without any evidentiary support, that the

8 BART Diridon Station is projected to be a destination station in the a.m. commute

9 direction, as patrons travel to nearby "activity centers," rather than an origin station.

10 Therefore, according to the Final SEIS/SEIR, the parking demand at this station will be

11 less than at stations that primarily function as origins in the a.m. commute direction.

12 (Response to SSE Comment P84-18 of the Final SEIS/EIR.) Since the preparation of

13 the 2005 Downtown Strategy and FEIR, the City of San Jose has prepared two EIR

14 addendums to revise the phasing of downtown development, to account for the fact that

15 the demand for residential development has outpaced demand for office space (jobs).

16 As a result, downtown San Jose is, like the rest of the City, jobs poor. This is why the

17 Envision San Jose 2040 General Plan emphasizes correcting the City's jobs-to-housing

18 imbalance, including in the Downtown Growth Area. Being jobs poor means the BART

19 Diridon Station will be an originator, not a destination station. The Final SEIS/EIR not

20 only has no evidence for the assertion that BART Diridon will be a destination, the

21 evidence is entirely is to the contrary. The Final SEIS/SEIR's reversal of such well-known

22 commuter flow information is evidence of manipulation intended to achieve a
preordained result.

23

24 62.4. The City of San Jose is a city of a million residents - the largest in the

25 San Francisco Bay Area. Diridon Station is located in its downtown and will one day be.

26 the largest transit station in the western United States with automobiles, light rail, bus

27 transit, the Caltrain commuter line, passenger rail service (Capitol Corridor, ACE),

28 Amtrak Coast Starlight, California High Speed Rail, and BART all converging at the
same location. These facts encourage the provision of parking, not discourage it.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

10517568.DOC 21

W N Caltrain supplies parking at Diridon Station that is often full. There is a Caltrain stop in
Santa Clara, and Caltrain provides parking there as well. Caltrain has not determined
that, since Diridon is only "one stop away," parking would not be provided there. The
objective evidence based on the Caltrain data is that BART Diridon Station is an
originator and the functional equivalent of an end-of-the-line station. Absent agency

7 desire to reach a predestined result, there is no explanation for how any competent

8 disclosure document could draw the opposite conclusion from the data.

9 62.5. Traffic volume data collected by the California Department of

10 Transportation (Caltrans) shows that the total traffic volume along I-680 and I-880

11 north of San Jose during the a.m. and p.m. peak periods is practically is the same in the

12 northbound and southbound directions. Thus, contrary to unsupported assertions

13 presented in the Final SEIS/SEIR, current traffic volumes on I-680 and I-880 north of

14 San Jose confirm that the Diridon Station will serve as an origin for persons traveling to

15 the north, as well as a destination for trips from the north. Not applying available

16 reliable information, such as Caltrans matcrials, and instead presenting selective

17 assumptions regarding the BART Diridon Station's function, lacks scientific integrity
and is evidence of VTA's bias.

18

19 62.6. The VTA's conclusion that the Diridon Station will function as a

20 destination station is not supported by the information presented in Table 3-18 of the

21 Final SEIS/SEIR. This is the only data the Final SEIS/SEIR presents in the record to

22 support its assertion. However, the table simply presents comparative travel times for

23 selected origin-destination pairs. Though several pairs represent trips to downtown San

24 Jose, the table does not present any pairs with downtown San Jose as the origin and a

25 destination of Milpitas, Union City, Fremont, Pleasanton, etc. This cherry-picking of

26 data does not present an accurate picture of the function of the BART Diridon Station

27 and indicates a determined attempt by VTA, in the Final SEIS/SEIR, to put its thumb
on the scale of the analysis.

28 62.7. Contrary to the statement in the Final SEIS/SEIR that driving to Diridon

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

10517568.DOC 22

Station is not convenient, the locations of the on- and off-ramps to all major highways
2 near Diridon demonstrate that such access is convenient and that the station will serve
as an origination station for riders west and south of downtown San Jose. The decision
to locate the Arena in that location, and the continued success of the Arena in that
location, are predicated on this convenient automobile access.

6 62.8. The Diridon Station Area Plan ("DSAP") Final EIR' includes t
7 discussion of parking and traffic associated with the BART and HSR projects in the

8 Cumulative Conditions scenario and trips. The DSAP EIR relied on the trips generated
9 and parking spaces included in the BART project and from the traffic study completed
10 for the BART FEIS (2010). This information was vital to the determination of

11 cumulative impacts in the DSAP EIR. Indeed, the DSAP project is an extremely
12 important project to the City of San Jose, as major developers are purchasing properties

13 and beginning the entitlement process that would allow millions of square feet of

14 development. The approved DSAP included in its impacts analysis the previously

15 promised parking for the BART project, and the DSAP concluded that parking would
16 be required at the Diridon Station to accommodate BART users. To not include the
17 previously promised and relied upon parking puts the DSAP projects in jeopardy. The

18 claim that the decision not to provide any park-and-ride parking is consistent with other

19 land use plans affecting the Diridon Station area, such as the DSAP, is simply untrue,

20 without any support in the record, and is calculated to lead to a particular and wrong
21 conclusion.

22 62.9. At 3-79, the Final SEIS/SEIR concedes that "if' BART riders access the

23 BART Diridon Station for park-and-ride, they could also use "several downtown

24 parking garages." However, there is no parking study demonstrating that any of these
25 spaces are "excess." Certainly, on evenings and weekends those spaces are often filled

26 by Arena patrons. During the day, meanwhile, these garages are filled close to capacity,

27 leaving few spaces that are actually available for BART customers. The extent to which

2 early morning BART commuters take parking currently used by downtown businesses

3 and residents is exactly the impact the FTA requires VTA to analyze and mitigate?. This

4 parking-pressure scenario, which is unevaluated and unmitigated in the Final

Ur SEIS/SEIR, could result in the downtown parking facilities being overrun with BART

6 parkers. The failure to study or disclose this impact is consistent with other existing

7 BART stations being woefully under-parked, and this pattern of not addressing the

8 well-known problem of lack of parking at BART stations is another line of evidence

9 demonstrating agency bias.

10 62.10. Another example of analysis ignoring obvious facts is that VTA and

11 BART have determined that the Alum Rock/28th Street Station warrants the

12 construction of 1,200 parking spaces. Yet, this station does not meet the criteria of an

13 end-of-the-line station to the extent that Diridon Station does. As any resident of the

14 South Bay knows, Alum Rock is far less convenient than Diridon. Even the underlying

15 information buried in the Final SEIS/SEIR is consistent with that obvious fact, yet the

16 conclusion is to the contrary in the Final SEIS/SEIR.

17 62.11. Providing parking at the BART Santa Clara Station will not alleviate the

18 parking pressure caused by the BART Diridon Station, contrary to VTA's argument

19 (without supporting evidence) in the Final SEIS/SEIR. The only direction to travel on

20 BART from Diridon will be to the north - whether to an area of the City of Santa Clara

21 without housing or jobs, or to the East Bay. Driving from San Jose to get on BART in

22 Santa Clara, where a 500-space parking lot is proposed (and opposed by Apple, which

23 leases a building that will be removed to construct the Santa Clara Station parking

24 structure), makes no sense since vehicular and transit options in that area are

25 disconnected. The proposed Santa Clara Station and parking lot area is inaccessible on

26 two sides (airport to the east and major rail line to the west). To assume that SAP

27 Center patrons in San Jose and southern Santa Clara County will drive to Santa Clara to

28 take BART to Diridon to attend an event is nonsensical.

2 62.12. The obviously inaccurate statements in the Final SEIS/SEIR regarding

3 information well known to any resident of the South Bay is beyond mere error. These

4 inaccuracies are asserted without any evidence in the record or are based on cherry-

5 picked data. This is not good faith and does not make for a neutral disclosure document.

6 63. Refusal to Analyze Parking Impacts under CEQA. Under CEQA Pub. Res C.

7 21099, there have been limitations placed on CEQA analysis of parking impacts in "transit

8 priority areas." However, that section does not eliminate all parking from analysis. It only

9 applies to certain narrowly defined types of parking that fall within the statute, as follows:

10 63.1. Public Resources Code § 21099 only excludes parking from CEQA

11 analysis that is "for" a project. Here the BART Diridon Station is permanently

12 removing existing parking (715) that is used for the Arena and other existing Diridon

13 Station users, not for the Project. Nothing in CEQA prevents this impact from being
disclosed, analyzed, and mitigated.

14

15 63.2. Public Resources Code § 21099 eliminated analysis of parking for

16 projccts within a transit priority area. However, this is the major modification of a

17 transit priority area itself by development of the BART station. The Diridon Station is

18 already a transit priority area and adding another transit hub to the existing area is

19 different than putting in a residential, mixed use, or employment center project and

20 therefore is not excluded from analysis. This makes sense because it would be absurd

21 not to include the largest transit mode (vehicles) in an analysis of the projected biggest
intermodal station in the West.

22 64.

23 Failure to Comply with Land Use Plans. The City and San Jose Arena

24 Management, LLC, are parties to an Arena Management Agreement (AMA), which includes a

25 Transportation and Parking Management Plan (TPMP) over 100 pages in length, The AMA

26 requires the City to maintain certain levels of available parking within close proximity to the

27 Arena, and to manage traffic operations in order to ensure convenient and efficient ingress and

28 egress to and from the Arena.3 Typically, environmental documents relating to projects in the

These obligations were clarified and reaffirmed pursuant to a Term Sheet effective May 19, 2015.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

10517568.DOC 25

1 vicinity of the Arena have considered these obligations as part of their analyses. In other

2 words, public agencies have treated the City's obligations under the AMA as tantamount to a

3 land use plan and have considered whether the projects in question would be consistent with

4 that plan.

5 64.1. The City's obligations related to parking and traffic are expressly

6 incorporated into the June 2014 final plan report for the Diridon Station Area Plan

7 ("DSAP"). Other land use plans have requirements that the Final SEIS/SEIR also

8 ignores, including: the 2004 Final EIR for the San Jose Water Land Company Planned
9 Development Rezoning, the 2005 Downtown Strategy 2000 Final Program EIR, the
10 2011 Envision San Jose 2040 General Plan Final Program EIR, the 2015 Envision San

11 Jose 2040 General Plan Supplemental EIR, the 2014 Diridon Station Area Plan EIR, the

12 2015 Final EIR for Caltrain's Peninsula Corridor Electrification Project, and a host of

13 others. The primary project objectives listed on pages 1-5 of the DSAP include
14 "ensur[ing] the continued vitality of the San Jose Arena, recognizing that the San Jose

15 Arena is a major anchor for both Downtown San Josc and the Diridon Station arca, and

16 that sufficient parking and efficient access for San Jose Arena Customers, consistent

17 with the provisions of the Arena Management Agreement, are critical for the San Jose

18 Arena's on-going success." The DSAP includes numerous provisions in support of this

19 objective, including the following:

20 Since its opening some two decades ago as the home of

21 the San Jose Sharks, the San Jose Arena has consistently
ranked among the 10 busiest indoor facilities for non-
22 sporting entertainment events. Preserving the extraordinary success of Downtown's 'anchor tenant'
23 appears is paramount and is reflected in the Land Use Plan.

24 Although densities will increase, and parking ratios will drop over time, it is imperative that Diridon's
25 development occurs in a coordinated fashion with its

26 transportation infrastructure to ensure adequate parking supply for the San Jose Arena and avoid traffic problems
27 in each phase of development. (Page 2-3)

28 The San Jose Arena Management Agreement commits the
City to pursue best efforts to achieve and maintain at least

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
26
10517568.DOC

a ü Dw N 6,350 parking spaces at Off-Site Parking Facilities available for Arena patrons within one-half mile of the West Santa Clara Street entrance to the Arena, of which approximately half of such spaces will be within one-third mile of the West Santa Clara Street entrance. In addition,
the City will manage and facilitate convenient vehicular access to and from parking facilities located in the Diridon Station area. Future TPMPs need to be in compliance
with this agreement in order to meet the City's obligations

7 and ensure the continued success of the Arena as an

8 anchor of the Diridon area and as a regional draw. (Page
2-133)

9 64.2. The City made a similar point in its March 6, 2017 Comment Letter at

10

11 pages 6, 7, 10 and 11. The Final SEIS/SEIR for the Phase II Project completely ignores
these important land use plans. The AMA and DSAP are baseline conditions of the

12

13 Diridon Station area that were identified in the SSE February 27, 2015 Scoping Letter,

yet the Final SEIS/SEIR fails to identify or evaluate the adverse impacts the Phase II

14 Project will have as a result of its inconsistencies with the Land Use Plans in the

15

16 Diridon Station area. Instead, the Final SEIS/SEIR claims falsely that it is consistent

17 with the Plans, despite being informed otherwise by the City and SSE in their comment
letters. (Final FEIS/SEIR Master Response 3.)

18 64.3. A transportation and parking evaluation is something the City of San Jose

19

20 would require in an EIR for any other large project in the Diridon Station area. The City
has, on multiple occasions, recognized the need to consider and mitigate adverse

21 impacts on the Arena caused by any major project in the Diridon Station area,

22 particularly impacts related to parking and transportation. This expressly includes

23 transit projects. a In a memo dated June 6, 2014, City staff recommended the following

24

25 approach, which was accepted by the City Council upon approval of the Diridon Station

Area Plan:

26 For the BART and High Speed Rail transit projects, the

27 City will request that the lead agency conduct a project

28 parking analysis. The analysis should include a projection
of parking demand, demand management strategies,
recommended supply solutions, and potential impacts on

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

10517568.DOC 27

-
2 the existing parking supply within the Diridon area, including suggested ways to mitigate the impact if it is

ty deemed significant. The results of any parking analysis will be provided to Arena Management for review and

v comment. The City will consider Arena Management's

5 timely feedback in formulating comments that the City forwards to the lead agency as part of the project

6 development and approval process.

7 64.4. VTA's Master Response 3 includes the following inaccurate and

8 misleading statement: "Additionally, the decision to not provide park-and-ride facilities

9 for the BART Extension at Diridon Station is also consistent with the Envision San Jose

10 2040 General Plan, Commercial Downtown Land Use Plan Policies, and Transportation

11 Policies (adopted November 2011)." The response goes on to list several City of San

12 Jose land use policies, none of which say that parking for BART should be excluded

13 from the Diridon Station area.

14 64.5. In fact, parking for BART at the Diridon Station has been included in

15 every previous environmental and planning document prepared for its extension to San

16 Jose. It was also included in the DSAP FEIR prepared by the City of San Jose, which is

17 consistent with the City's General Plan. To say that San Jose policies somehow

18 encourage the decision to exclude BART parking from the Diridon Station area is

19 untrue, particularly in light of the fact that San Jose has a contractual obligation to

20 provide parking in the area. The insistence on mischaracterizing the applicable land use

21 plans evidences improper agency bias and the intention to avoid an objective evaluation

22 of this issue.

23 64.6. VTA has given only lip service to compliance with land use plans. The

24 Final SEIS/SEIR makes misleading assertions of compliance with selected phrases

25 within carefully chosen land use plans. Ignored is the fact that VTA is breaching its

26 commitments made in multiple certified environmental documents that others have

27 rightfully relied upon. Also ignored is that it is others, particularly Petitioner, who will

28 bear the burden of this failure to comply with the existing land use plans.
65. Inadequate Analysis of Indirect Impacts From Lack of Parking, CEQA

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

10517568.DOC 28

requires an analysis of indirect impacts due to a lack of parking both during construction and in

2 the long-term. Air quality emissions are generated due to the additional driving required to find
parking, while other indirect impacts include those related to pedestrian and bicycle safety. The

4 Transportation/Traffic section of the CEQA checklist asks the question:

5 Would the project: Conflict with adopted policies, plans,

6 or programs regarding public transit, bicycle, or pedestrian
facilities, or otherwise decrease the performance or safety
7 of such facilities? (Appendix G of the CEQA Guidelines,
XVI(f).)
8

9 65.1. The lack of adequate parking both during construction and in the long-

10 term will result in many situations where the safety of bicycle and pedestrian facilities

11 will be compromised. When parking is unavailable, the occurrence of predictable illegal

12 on-street parking (in loading zones and restricted parking areas or across driveways and

13 sidewalks) will affect the ability of pedestrians and bicyclists to have an adequate line

14 of sight, and the quality of pedestrian and bicycle paths of travel will necessarily be

15 compromised and could result in injury or death. This concern is especially acute for

16 children and people using wheelchairs. Safety is standard issue to be evaluated under

17 CEQA, yet it has not been evaluated.

18 66. Refusal to Provide Effective, Measurable and Enforceable Mitigation

19 Measures. The Final SEIS/SEIR states that temporary traffic disruptions will be mitigated by

20 the development and implementation of a Construction Transportation Management Plan

21 ("CTMP"); however, the Final SEIS/SEIR does not identify any specific details about this

22 future CTMP, or even suggest metrics of its effectiveness. Given the long duration and heavy

23 amount of construction work along major arterials and adjacent to existing businesses and

24 residences in downtown San Jose, this appears to be at best a program-level analysis of the

25 impacts. If the intention of this analysis is to be project-specific, then this is improper "deferred

26 mitigation" under CEQA.

27 66.1. The basic CTMP details and measures of effectiveness need to be

28 identified in the Final SEIS/SEIR to show that this mitigation is in fact feasible and will
reduce the transportation impacts. As stated in CEQA Guidelines Section

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
29
10517568.DOC

1 15126.4(a)(B):

2 Formulation of mitigation measures should not be deferred
3 until some future time. However, measures may specify performance standards which would mitigate the
4 significant effect of the project and which may be accomplished in more than one specific way.
5

6 66.2. There are no specifics or performance standards regarding this proposed

7 CTMP mitigation measure in the Draft SEIS/SEIR. To state that VTA will, at some

8 future date, work with the Cities of San Jose and Santa Clara to develop Master

9 Cooperative Agreements that will direct all coordination efforts between VTA and the

10 cities prior to and during construction of the BART Extension (pages 5-80 of the Final

11 SEIS/SEIR) is too little, too late. There will be no recourse for residents and businesses

12 should specific measures not be implemented during construction. In fact, at this point,

13 the cities and the public have no idea what measures would actually be utilized, let

14 alone a guarantee that they would ever be implemented.

15 66.3. The Final SEIS/SEIR acknowledges on page 6.2-6 that "construction

16 activities for the BART Extension Alternative may result in lane or road closures in the

17 vicinity of SAP Center and Avaya Stadium." However, the document states that

18 "because potential interference with activities at event centers is not included in

19 Appendix G of the State CEQA Guidelines .. . this discussion is provided for

20 informational purposes." This is an incorrect interpretation of CEQA.

21 66.4. The Final SEIS/SEIR then states that "similar to other businesses and

22 property owners affected by construction, VTA will coordinate with the

23 owners/operators of these event centers to provide information regarding lane closures

24 and detours and provide wayfinding signs during construction." However, coordination

25 alone is not adequate mitigation. While Appendix G of the CEQA Guidelines does not

26 specifically mention event centers, question X., "Land Use and Planning (a)," asks:

27 "Would the project physically divide an established community?" A decade of lane

28 closures, lost parking, and disruptive construction activity immediately adjacent to
residents and long-established businesses, including the Arena, would significantly

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
30
10517568.DOC

impact the viability of these businesses and would physically divide an established

2 community. This impact is not identified, analyzed, or mitigated in the Final
3 SEIS/SEIR.

4 66.5. The Final SEIS/SEIR is deficient because it is impossible to determine if

5 the sidewalk on the south (eastbound) side of Santa Clara Street between Stockton and

6 Delmas Avenues will remain fully available for pedestrians during construction. Pages

7 5-74 of the Final SEIS/SEIR states that there will be lane closure (and, implicitly,

8 sidewalk closures) on Santa Clara Street. That is inconsistent with Figures 5-7/8, which

9 indicate the construction staging area will not intrude onto Santa Clara Street. This

10 creates two problems: (1) The document does not accurately identify the potential

11 adverse impacts, and (2) the Arena will suffer significant adverse impacts if any portion

12 of the sidewalk is inaccessible to pedestrians, or if the vehicular capacity of Santa Clara

13 Street is diminished.

14 67. Inadequate Alternatives Analysis. The Alternatives analysis is wholly

15 inadequate under CEQA. The Final SEIS/SEIR includes only three CEQA alternatives (No

16 Project, BART, and TOJD & BART), which do not constitute an adequate "reasonable range"

17 of CEQA alternatives in accordance with CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6(a), which states:

18 An EIR shall describe a range of reasonable alternatives to

19 the project, or to the location of the project, which would feasibly attain most of the basic objectives of the project,
20 but would avoid or substantially lessen any of the
significant effects of the project, and evaluate the
21 comparative merits of the alternatives.

22 67.1. The three alternatives included in the SEIS/SEIR do not address the
23 potential to reduce or avoid significant impacts of the Phase II Project. In fact, there are
24 only two real alternatives analyzed aside from the required No Project Alternative, and
25 these are essentially two variations of the proposed project. There is no real discussion
26 of other potential Alternatives that could reduce the significant impacts identified
27 (particularly the transportation disruption and noise impacts). The courts have held that
28 a major function of an EIR is "to ensure that all reasonable alternatives are thoroughly

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
31
10517568.DOC

D W N assessed by the responsible official (or board)." Wildlife Alive v. Chickering (1976) 18
Cal.3d 190, 197.
67.2. Similarly, CEQA Guidelines §15126.6(b) & (c) provides:

a Purpose. Because an EIR must identify ways to mitigate
or avoid the significant effects that a project may have on
the environment (Public Resources Code Section 21002.1)

7 the discussion of alternatives shall focus on alternatives to

8 the project or its location which are capable of avoiding or substantially lessening any significant effects of the

9 project, even if these alternatives would impede to some
degree the attainment of the project objectives, or would
be more costly.

10

11 Selection of a range of reasonable alternatives. The range

12 of potential alternatives to the proposed project shall include those that could feasibly accomplish most of the

13 basic objectives of the project and could avoid or

14 substantially lessen one or more of the significant effects.
The EIR should briefly describe the rationale for selecting

15 the alternatives to be discussed. The EIR should also
identify any alternatives that were considered by the lead

16 agency but were rejected as infeasible during the scoping

17 process and briefly explain the reasons underlying the lead
agency's determination ..

18 67.3. The two alternatives analyzed in the Final SEIS/SEIR are variations of

19 the proposed Phase II Project, and do not appear to be created specifically to reduce

20 potential environmental impacts of the project. Although the Final SEIS/SEIR is a

21 subsequent analysis that tiers off prior environmental documents and incorporates those

22 prior analyses by reference, the prior environmental documents were of a program

23 nature. There is no discussion of the original selection process for this segment of the

24 BART alignment and no evaluation of why it was the selected.

68.

25 Additional Inadequate Analysis of the Impacts in the Final SEIS/SEIR. The

26 Final SEIS/SEIR determined that construction of the Santa Clara Station with TOJD results in

27 an impact at the intersection of Coleman Avenue and Brokaw Road (LOS F: PM peak hour)

28 (page 3-97) under City of Santa Clara criteria. Page 3-98 of the Final SEIR/SEIR states that a
mitigation measure for this intersection has been proposed and is presented in Impact BART

10517568.DOC PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
32

Extension + TOJD TRA-1. The is mitigation measure is actually TRA-A and includes

2 improvements at the intersection (page 3-111) that the Final SEIS/SEIR states would reduce
impacts to a less than significant level. However, page 2-17 (last paragraph) of the Final

4 SEIS/SEIR states that, "Improvements to Brokaw Road and the intersection of Brokaw Road

5 and Coleman Avenue near the Santa Clara Station are not part of the project." If this is the

6 case, the project no longer includes mitigation for the project-generated traffic impacts at the

7 Coleman/Brokaw intersection, which is a violation of CEQA. In addition, the text of Chapter 3,

8 where the impact is identified, has not been revised in the Final SEIS/SEIR. This confusion

9 misleads the decision-makers who must certify the environmental documents and approve the

10 project. VTA did not address this issue in their response to SSE's letter dated April 2, 2018.

11 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

12 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for relief as follows:

13 1. For a peremptory writ of mandate commanding VTA:

14 A. To vacate and set aside its decisions (1) certifying the Final SEIS/SEIR

15 for the Project, (2) approving the Project, and (3) approving other related environmental

16 documents; and

17 B. To comply with CEQA prior to any future approvals of the Project.

18 2. For a stay, temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and permanent

19 injunction suspending and prohibiting any actions by VTA in furtherance of the Project until

20 VTA has complied with all requirements of CEQA;

21 3. For costs of suit;

22 4. For attorney's fees and other litigation expenses under C.C.P. $1021.5 or other

23 applicable law; and

24 5. For such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.
