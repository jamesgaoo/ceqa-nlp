1 INTRODUCTION

2 Petitioner IRVINE COALITION FOR THE ENVIRONMENT ("Petitioner") alleges as
3 follows:

4 1. Petitioner challenges certain land use decisions made by respondent City Council
5 of the City of Irvine ("Council") as the elected legislative body for respondent City of Irvine
6 ("City"). (The Council and the City are hereinafter collectively referred to as "Respondent.")
7 Specifically, Petitioner challenges Respondent's various approvals requested by real parties in
8 interest J & R Main Street, LLC and Morgan Kewen Zhang (collectively "RPI") relating to
9 RPI's project referred to as the "15 Degrees South Residential Project" (the "Project").

10 2. Petitioner contends that Respondent violated the California Environmental
11 Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code §§ 21000, et seq., "CEQA") by failing to require RPI to
12 have the Project analyzed by means of a focused "second-tier" project environmental impact
13 report ("EIR") or other legally required environmental document made available for public
14 review instead of an addendum ("Addendum") to the Irvine Business Complex (IBC) Vision
15 Plan and Mixed Use Zoning Code Final Environmental Impact Report (State Clearinghouse
16 No. 2007011024: "the IBC FEIR") that Respondent did not circulate for public review and had
17 not even prepared at the time it began conducting public hearings on the Project. Petitioner
18 contends the Addendum was rife with faulty information and analysis, ignored major
19 environmental concerns, and that Respondent's actions violated specific provisions of CEQA
20 and the Guidelines for Implementation of CEQA (Tit. 14, Cal. Code Regs., §§ 15000 et seq.:
21 the "Guidelines") as well as its own IBC FEIR.

22 3. Petitioner further contends that Respondent violated its own policies, Municipal
23 Code, General Plan and the Subdivision Map Act.
24 4. The Project is being challenged because (among other thing) it is a project that
25 results in significant impacts on the environment that have not been adequately assessed or
26 mitigated in accordance with CEQA and Guidelines and there are numerous inconsistencies
27 and deficiencies with the Project. Respondent ignored the lack of substantial evidence to
28 support its various approvals of the Project, and it intentionally ignored the requirements of

Paimieri, Tylor,+ -2-
Wlihelm & Waldron LLP
Altorneys al Law VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

2311296.3

1 CEQA, the Guidelines and its own IBC FEIR as well as its own policies, General Plan and
2 Municipal Code. Respondent erred by failing and refusing to analyze the significant impacts
3 caused by the Project.

4 5. In failing and refusing to prepare a legally adequate environmental document that
5 fairly, fully and honestly disclosed and analyzed the potential impacts that will result from the
6 Project, refusing and failing to comply with the requirements of CEQA, the Guidelines,
7 Respondent's own IBC FEIR, policies, General Plan and Municipal Code, and failing to
8 require adequate mitigation measures, Respondent has disregarded the specific and substantive
9 requirements of CEQA and the Guidelines and abused its discretion and failed to comply with
10 applicable law.

11 6. Petitioner requests that this Court vacate and set aside Respondent's approval of
12 the Project and the Addendum by issuing a writ of mandate, under Code of Civil Procedure
13 Sections 1085 and/or 1094.5, directing Respondent to vacate and set aside its approval of the
14 Project and Addendum. These claims are based on the following allegations.

15 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

16 7. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to sections 1085, 1094.5 and
17 187 of the Code of Civil Procedure and sections 21168 and/or 21168.5 of the Public Resources

18 Code.

19 8. Venue for this action properly lies in the Orange County Superior Court because
20 Respondent, the property and the Project are located in Orange County.

21 PARTIES AND BENEFICIAL INTEREST

22 9. Petitioner is an unincorporated association composed of and supported by
23 individuals and groups devoted to the preservation of the environment. Petitioner is a
24 grassroots community group that (among other things) was organized for the purpose of
25 representing the interests of the public in assuring Respondent's compliance with the State's
26 environmental and land use laws. Members of Petitioner reside within the City of Irvine
27 and/or own real property within the City of Irvine. On behalf of these and other City residents,
28 Petitioner challenges Respondent's approval of the Project.

Palmieri, Tyler. Wtener
Wilhelm & Waldron LLP
Aitorneys el Law VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
| 2311296.3

1 10. Petitioner has standing and is a party beneficially interested in the issuance of the
2 requested writ of mandate and injunctive and declaratory relief (i) because in accordance with
3 subdivision (c) of Public Resources Code section 21177, Petitioner is an organization formed

4 after Respondent's approval of the Project to maintain this action against Respondent, and (ii)
5 because certain members of Petitioner, including Irvine Residents for the Environment, an
6 unincorporated association, and GHC Properties, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company,
7 complied with subdivisions (a) and (b) of Public Resources Code section 21177 and exhausted
8 their administrative remedies by timely commenting on and objecting to the Project and
9 Addendum. Moreover, unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate, the impacts
10 resulting from the Respondent's decision to approve the Project will extend to areas in which
11 Petitioner's members, supporters and numerous citizens represented by Petitioner live and will
12 directly and adversely affect their living environment.

13 11. Petitioner brings this public interest litigation as a citizen's action, and no matter
14 how any portion of this Petition's allegations or prayer is construed, in no way does Petitioner
15  intend to assert a claim or seek relief herein that is inconsistent with the following parameters:
16 A. Petitioner does not seek any relief greater than or different from the relief
17 sought for the general public or for a class of which Petitioner's members and supporters
18 residing within the geographical jurisdiction of the City of Irvine are themselves members.

19 B. By bringing this action, Petitioner seeks to enforce an important right
20 affecting the public interest and to confer a significant benefit, whether pecuniary or
21 nonpecuniary, on the general public or a large class of persons.
22 C. Private enforcement is necessary and places a disproportionate financial
23 burden on Petitioner in relating to its stake in this matter.
24 12. Respondent City is a charter city organized and existing under and by virtue of
25 the laws of the State of California and is situated in the County of Orange.

26 13. Respondent Council is the duly elected legislative body of respondent City. The
27 Council is responsible for regulating and controlling land use police powers in all areas within
28 the City, including (but not limited to) implementing and complying with all of the provisions

Palmieri, Tyler, Wiener -4-
Withelm & Waldron LLP
Altornoys a VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

2311296.3

of CEQA, the Guidelines, the Planning and Zoning Law, the Subdivision Map Act, and the
2 City's Municipal Code, General Plan, ordinances, rules and regulations.

3 14. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that real party in
4 interest J & R Main Street, LLC, is an Oregon limited liability company. J & R Main Street,
5 LLC is identified on the staff reports, agendas, and other materials presented to the City's

6 Planning Commission and Council as the applicant for the Project.

7 15. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that real party in
8 interest Morgan Kewen Zhang is an individual and owns and/or operates real party in interest J
9 & R Main Street, LLC.

10 16. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of the respondents named
11 herein as DOES through 10 and the real parties in interest named herein as DOES 11 through
12 25, inclusive, and therefore sues those respondents and real parties in interest by such fictitious
13 names. Petitioner will amend this petition to allege the true names and capacities of those Doe
14 parties when ascertained. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that
15 each of the parties designated herein as a Doe a is responsible in some manner for the events and
16 actions referred to herein.

17 17. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that at all relevant
18 times the City, the Council, J & R Main Street, Morgan Kewen Zhang, and the Doe
19 respondents and real parties in interest were and are the agents of each other, authorized to do
20 the acts herein alleged, each of which was ratified by the others.

21 18. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, or otherwise of
22 Does 1 through 25 are unknown to Petitioner who therefore sues Does 1 through 25 by such
23 fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this petition to allege the true names and capacities of
24 the Doe respondents when the same becomes known to it. Reference to "City," "Council,"
25 "Respondent," "J&R Main Street," "Morgan Kewen Zhang" or "RPI" herein shall mean the
26 named respondents and Does 1 through 25.

27 19. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that the City and
28 each of the Does proximately caused the acts, omissions to act, and/or injuries herein alleged.

Paimiert, Tyler, Wiener -5-
Wiihalm & Waldron LLP
Altcrneys at Law VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

2311296.3

1 20. The City is, and at all times relevant herein has been, charged by law with the
2| performance of all duties arising under CEQA and the Guidelines, including (but not limited
3 to) the preparation and certification of a legally adequate environmental impact report ("EIR")
4 for the Project.

5 21. Petitioner has exhausted all legally available administrative remedies against the
6 City's decision to approve the Project. The decision of the City to approve the Project is a final
7 determination. If the Court does not grant the relief prayed for herein, Petitioner will suffer
8 irreparable injury for which it has no adequate remedy at law, there will be a waste, and the
9. failure to enjoin further conduct may tend to render the judgment in this action ineffectual.

10 22. Petitioner has previously complied with the requirements of Public Resources
11 Code section 21167.5 by sending, via United States Postal Service First Class Mail, written
12 notice of this action to the City. A copy of the written notice provided to the City with proof of
13 service of same is attached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated herein by this reference.

14 23. Petitioner will comply with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
15 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 by furnishing a copy of this Verified Petition
16 for Writ of Mandate to the Attorney General of California.

17 24. Petitioner has timely filed this Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate in
18 accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167, subdivision (d), CEQA Guidelines
19 section 15112, subdivision (c)(2) and Government Code section 65009.
20 ALLEGATIONS

21 The Project

22 25. The Project site consists of a 2.43 acre subsection of a larger 7.52-acre parcel
23 bounded by Main Street, Cartwright Road and Da Vinci in the IBC. Approximately 3.793
24 acres of the parcel have already been approved for the construction of a 272-unit apartment
25 building. An existing 5-story office building occupies a 1.397-acre section of the larger parcel.
26 The Project proposes to locate a second 150-unit apartment building within the remaining 2.43

27 acres of the larger parcel, along with a multi-story parking garage that is already under
28 construction. The previously-approved parking garage is intended to replace surface parking

Palmberi, Tyler, Wiener -6-
Wilheim & Waldron LLP VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE Attorneys
| 2311296.3

1 for the office building, as well as providing parking space for approximately half of the
2 proposed 150-unit apartment building, including all visitors.

3 26: According to the Addendum for the Project, the 272-unit structure will be
4 constructed on Lot 1 of the original parcel. The parking structure and 150-unit apartment
5 building will be located on Lot 2 and a portion of Lot 1 of the larger parcel. The Vesting Tract

6 Map for the Project proposes to create a condo map over a portion of Lot 2 of the original
7 parcel. The Conditional Use Permit ("CUP") for the Project does not include the parking
8 garage located on Lot 2, designating it as "not a part." Although it appears the Office Building
9 site is included in the site of the CUP, it is not included in most of the submitted plans. CUP
10 conditions of approval do not address the Office Building. There is uncertainty regarding the
11 scope of the Project due to the incomplete, inconsistent and inadequate Project descriptions. In
12 some, but not all documents, the Project is referred to as "Phase 3" of residential development
13 on the original parcel, totaling 422 units. Other documents refer to it as a stand-alone project.
14 Respondent's Approval of the Project

15 27. The City's approval of the Project consists of three separate approvals--Vesting
16 Tentative Tract Map 18093 (00702224-PTT) (hereafter the "Tentative Tract Map"),
17 Conditional Use Permit 00696272-PCPU (hereafter the "CUP") and Park Plan (00698461-PPP)
18 (hereafter the "Park Plan"')--and the Addendum to the IBC FEIR that purported to analyze the
19 Project's potential environmental impacts.

20 28. On November 15, 2017, the City's Community Services Commission held a
21  public meeting on the Park Plan. Objections were raised at that meeting. At the time this
22 meeting occurred, City staff had not prepared the Addendum. The Community Services
23 Commission voted to recommend Planning Commission approval of the Park Plan.
24 29. On November 22, 2017, the City's Subdivision Committee held a public meeting

25 on the Tentative Tract Map. Objections were raised at the meeting including the fact that City
26 staff had not yet prepared the Addendum they claimed adequately analyzed all of the Project's
27 potential environmental impacts much less made it available to the public, even though it was
28 referenced in the Committee findings. Nevertheless, the Subdivision Committee voted to

Paimiert, Tyler, Wieher -7-
Withelm & Waidron LLP
Attorneys at Law VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
2311296.3

1° recommend Planning Commission approval of the Tentative Tract Map. Page three of the
2 Subdivision Committee's Agenda included the following notice to the public:
3 APPEALS

4 Any person who owns property or resides within 500 feet of the
5 exterior boundaries of the subject property, the applicant or a
6 member of the City Council may appeal the determination of the
7 Subdivision Committee to the City Council. All appeals must be in
8 writing, state the reasons for the appeal and be submitted within
9 15 days of the decision to the City Clerk. The appeal shall be
10 accompanied by a $245 deposit. The City Council will hold a
11 public hearing on the appeal within 60 days of receipt of the
12 appeal. Decisions of the City Council are final.

13 (Emphasis added.)

14 30. On December 6, 2017, a representative for one of Petitioner's members submitted
15 an appeal to the City Council of the Subdivision Committee's recommendation on the
16 Tentative Tract Map. Despite compliance with the 15-day appeal time limit publicized in the
17 Subdivision Committee's Agenda for November 22, 2017 and within the 15-day appeal time
18 limit found in Section 1.6 ["Appeals"] of the City of Irvine Subdivision Manual, Supplement to
19 the Irvine Subdivision Ordinance, the City Clerk rejected the appeal as untimely.
20 31. On December 5, 2017, the City's Transportation Commission held a public
21 meeting on the Project's Traffic Impact Analysis. At the time this meeting occurred, City staff
22 had still not prepared or released for public review the Addendum they claimed would address
23 the Project's impacts, and objections were again raised. The Transportation Commission voted
24 to recommend Planning Commission approval of the Traffic Impact Analysis.
25 32. On December 21, 2017, the City's Planning Commission held a public meeting
26 regarding the Project. Objections to the Project were raised at the meeting. The Planning
27 Commission approved the Project and Addendum.

28

Palmieri, Tyler, Wiener
Wilhelm & Waldron LLP VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE Aitorneys at Law
2311296.3

1 33. Three separate appeals were filed to appeal the Planning Commission's approval
2 of the Project and Addendum to the Council.

3 34. On January 23, 2018, the Council held a public meeting regarding the appeals of

4 the Planning Commission's approval of the Project and Addendum. The City Council denied

5 the appeals and approved the Project and Addendum.

6 35. On January 25, 2018, the Notice of Determination relating to the Project was
7 posted with the Orange County Recorder's Office. As noted above, the City represented the
8 Project was a "phased" project, and Fish and Game Code Section 711.4 allows only one filing
9 fee to be paid for each project unless the project is tiered or phased. Attached hereto as Exhibit
10 B and incorporated herein by this reference are copies of the Notice of Determination and
11 documents showing neither Respondent nor RPI paid the fee for the Project required by Fish
12 and Game Code Section 711.4.

13 The "Cap"'

14 36. The Project site has a City General Plan Land Use Element designation of
15 Urban/Industrial and are located in the 5.1 IBC Multi-Use zoning district. The Project site is
16 within the Urban Neighborhood Overlay established by the IBC Vision Plan. The Urban
17 Neighborhood Overlay allows for development of up to 15,000 base units and up to 2,038
18 "density bonus" units subject to the approval of a conditional use permit (the "Cap").

19 37. Petitioner is informed and believes and based thereon alleges that, since at least
20 2010, the City has had a routine and consistent policy for implementing the "Cap" by reserving
21 residential dwelling unit allocations for pending projects based upon the time of submittal of
22 applications. Basically, a queue was established based upon submittal of applications.

23 38. Petitioner is informed and believes and based thereon alleges that: Respondent's
24 first screen-check comment letter to RPI, on January 19, 2017, advised that Respondent had no
25 residential units available for allocation to RPI's Project under the "Cap": "Absent an adequate
26 number of units becoming available under the existing 15,000 unit residential cap (Option 2
27 above) considering this project's place in line, submit a General Plan Amendment to request

28 an increase in the unit cap above 15,000 units." (Emphasis added.) In response on March 2,

Palmieti, Tyler, Wiener -9-
Wilhdim & Waldron LLP
Altorneys at Law VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

| 2311296.3

1 2017, RPI stated: "The applicant understands that there are more units in the conditional use
2 permit application process than units available under the 15,000 unit cap and wishes to proceed

3 without a general plan amendment applicant." On March 31, 2017, Respondent's Staff

4 reiterated that no units were available and added that a General Plan Amendment and Zone
5 Change would be required for the application to proceed.

6 39. Despite Respondent's policy and its prior written and oral statements, Petitioner
7 is informed and believes and based thereon alleges that Respondent suddenly, unilaterally and
8 without any official action purported to change its policy in order to assist RPI and its Project
9 to jump ahead of the queue. Petitioner is informed and believes and based thereon alleges that,
10 in effect, Respondent changed its queue into a race to the finish; then Respondent ignored the
11 environmental, zoning and other issues relating to the Project so that RPI's Project could obtain
12 its approval first and win the "race."

13 40. At the December 21, 2017 Planning Commission hearing, the Planning
14 Commission considered and approved the Project with numerous "waivers" of compliance
15 with the City's Code and in violation of CEQA. Thus, the Planning Commission's approval
16 and subsequent Council approval of the Project solidified RPI's "leap frogging" to take the
17 "Cap" allocations from another project whose application had been filed earlier. Petitioner is
18 informed and believes and based thereon alleges that Respondent turned a blind eye to the
19 various deficiencies of the Project in order to assist RPI to unlawfully jump ahead of the line.
20 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

21 (Against Respondents)
22 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

23 41. Petitioner realleges and incorporates, as though fully set forth herein, paragraphs
24 through 40 of this Petition.

25 Violation of CEQA and Guidelines:

26 42. CEQA applies to all "governmental agencies at all levels" and requires public
27 agencies to prepare an EIR whenever the approval of a project may cause significant adverse
28

Palmleri, Tyler, Wlener -10-
Wilheim & Waldron LLP
Atlorneys ai Law VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
2311296.3

1 effects or impacts on the environment. Respondent's decision to approve the Project was a

2 project approval causing significant adverse environmental impacts.
43. CEQA requires lead agencies to review the environmental impacts of all projects.
4 Under Public Resources Code section 21065, a project is any discretionary public "activity
5 which may cause either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably
6 foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment." Respondent's decision to approve
7 the Project was a discretionary decision by Respondent that will result in "reasonably
8 foreseeable" adverse environmental impacts.
9 44. Under CEQA and the Guidelines, a "significant effect on the environment"
10 means a substantial, or potentially substantial, adverse change in any of the physical conditions
11 within the area affected by the project including (among other things) land use, light and glare,
12 ambient noise, air quality, traffic and public safety.

13 45.. Respondent made use of an Addendum to the program IBC FEIR in order to
14 hastily approve the Project. With respect to the Project, the IBC FEIR and Addendum do not
15 comply with CEQA and the Guidelines. In addition, the Addendum is particularly
16 inappropriate and improper here because the IBC FEIR itself noted:

17 Once a Program EIR has been prepared, subsequent activities

18 within the program must be evaluated to determine whether

19 additional CEQA documentation needs to be prepared. However,

20 if the Program EIR addresses the program's effects as specifically

21 and comprehensively as possible, many subsequent activities could
22 be found to be within the Program EIR scope and additional

23 environmental documents may not be required (CEQA Guidelines
24 Section 15168[c]). When a Program EIR is relied on for

25 subsequent activity, the lead agency must incorporate feasible

26 mitigation measures and alternatives developed in the Program

27 EIR into the subsequent activities (CEQA Guidelines Section
28 15168[c][3]). If a subsequent activity would have effects not

Palmiari, Tyler, Wiener -11-
Wilhelm | Waldron LLP VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE Allorneya
| 2311296.3

1 within the scope of the Program EIR, the lead agency must
2 prepare a new Initial Study leading to a Negative Declaration,
3 Mitigated Negative Declaration or an EIR. In this case, the

4 Program EIR still serves a valuable purpose as the first-tier
5 environmental analysis.
6 (Bold added.) The Project here is not one of the seven "development projects" the IBC FEIR
7. addressed on a project level (as opposed to a programmatic level). A project of the scale and
8 magnitude--and with the obvious infirmities--of the Project was required to be analyzed for
9 CEQA purposes by means of a focused "second-tier" project EIR made available for public
10 review and comment. Instead, Respondent side-stepped these requirements through the

11 preparation of the nearly two thousand-page Addendum and kept it from public review and
12 scrutiny until the very end. Nevertheless, Respondent adopted the Project without first
13 complying with CEQA, the Guidelines and Respondent's IBC FEIR.

14 46. Subdivision (c)(3) of Fish and Game Code Section 711.4 provides, "a project
15 shall not be operative, vested, or final, and local government permits for the project shall not
16 be valid, until the filing fees requires pursuant to this section are paid" to the California
17 Department of Fish and Wildlife. Based upon the documents attached hereto as Exhibit B,
18 Petitioner is informed and believes and based thereon alleges that Respondent has not paid the
19 requisite fees and has attempted to avoid paying such fees by proceeding by way of the invalid
20 and illegal Addendum. As a result, the Project's approvals are not vested, final or valid.

21 47. Prior compliance with CEQA is also a prerequisite for a lead agency to approve a
22 discretionary project, and pursuant to Guidelines section 15051, the City was the lead agency
23| for the Project. The Project's potentially significant land use impacts required review under
24 CEQA and the Guidelines before the Council approved the Project. Nevertheless, Respondent
25 failed to undertake such compliance.

26 48. Petitioner's members informed the Council that the Project failed to conform to
27 the requirements of CEQA and the Guidelines. Petitioner's members also informed the
28 Council of the serious deficiencies with the information provided in the Addendum.

Wilholm Waldron
Altornoys at Law VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

2311296.3

1 Respondent failed to proceed in the manner required by law and its decision to approve the
2 Project is not supported by substantial evidence, including (but not limited to) the following:

3 A. Inconsistent Project Data: The record for the Project contains
4| irreconcilable inconsistencies regarding the Project. The square-footages of various existing
5 and proposed buildings are inconsistent throughout the information provided to the Council
6 and the public. For example, the office building square-footage was reported as 149,000
7 square-feet in the Planning Commission Staff Report, as 103,700 square-feet in the Traffic
8 Impact Analysis, and is not mentioned at all in the Addendum. The adopted Resolutions do
9 not mention the size of the existing office building at any point. Further, the Preliminary
10 Project Data Sheet reports a site coverage estimate/building footprint for the office building as
11 19,186 square-feet, which does not correlate with the other inconsistent reports of building
12 square-footage. Another example, the multi-purpose room is variously referred to as 933
13 square-feet, 1,163 square-feet and 1,310 square-feet. Similarly, the allocation of parking
14 spaces reported is inconsistent throughout the various documents provided to Respondent.

15 B. Misrepresented Project Density, Landscaping and Population: The
16 City's Zoning Code defines a "site" as "a parcel or parcels which are developed and planned as
17 a unit for either residential or nonresidential developments. (Zoning Code Sec. 1-2-1.)
18 Pursuant to the City's Zoning Code definition, the "site" for the Project is a 3.73-acre parcel
19 containing both a non-residential office building on 1.3 acres and a proposed 150-unit 7-story
20 residential project and a 6-story parking structure on 2.43 acres. Yet, 1n considering and
21 analyzing the Project, Respondent improperly ignored the office building, effectively treating
22 the land on which the office building sits as vacant for the purposes of density and other
23 required calculations. In considering the Project, Respondent also misrepresented the density
24  of the project by ignoring that the entire 7.52-acre site will effectively be developed as a
25  coordinated unit with an effective residential density of 68 units/net acre and a five-story office
26 building sharing one driveway straddling the boundary of the Project approvals. Respondent's
27 improper segregation violates CEQA by failing to consider the cumulative impacts and under-
28 reporting other impacts. In addition to the misrepresentations relating to the Project's density,

Palmiori, Tyter, Wioner -13-

2311296.3

1 the landscaping calculations erroneously included the rooftop and other structures that are to be
2 excluded from landscaping calculations pursuant to the City's Zoning Code. Likewise, the
3 Project population numbers are unreliable, inconsistent and in violation of State law.

4 C. Failure to Analyze and Consider Serious Geotechnical Problems: The
5 Addendum and Project approvals have failed to adequately analyze consider impacts from
6 groundwater elevations, liquefaction and expansive soils. There was no site-specific analysis
7 or information about geotechnical risks and potential mitigation techniques for this Project.
8 The only information was for other property in the vicinity. The Project approvals do not
9 impose special mitigation measures to address the geotechnical issues of the Project. Given
10 the high groundwater table and liquefaction potential reported in the Addendum, the
11 requirements for future geotechnical study and for later analysis of groundwater intrusion in
12 Standard Condition 2.6 and 2.7 of the approvals violate the prohibition on deferring analysis
13 and mitigation. Respondent ignored feasible mitigation measures discussed, but deferred, in
14 the Addendum.

15 D. Failure to Analyze and Consider Serious Contamination Issues
16 Affecting Residential Use of the Property: There is evidence of serious contamination issues
17 at the Property that may be exacerbated by the construction of the Project. The Project
18 construction includes the demolition of the existing data center building and construction of a
19 new 150-unit residential building. According to the Addendum, the Project site has
20 groundwater and soil contamination. Evidence submitted to Respondent is that the data center
21 building acted as a cap over the contamination, trapping toxic vapors in underlying soils.
22 When demolished and replaced with the residential building, it is likely vapor intrusion will
23 occur. Yet, Respondent approved the Project without any site-specific information about risks
24 and mitigation measures relating to the high risk of vapor intrusion and groundwater
25 contamination. Respondent has improperly deferred investigation of environmental hazards
26 and development of appropriate mitigation measures. Respondent ignored feasible mitigation

27 measures.

1 E. Failure to Analyze and Consider Traffic/Parking Impacts from the
2 Project: The Addendum does not consider the major modification to the parking for the office
3 building which includes an overall reduction in office parking spaces from 540 to no more than
4 402 spaces, removal of 22 at-grade spaces outside the structure, elimination of Main Street
5 access, reallocation of space from office use to Project resident use, and gate/access changes to

6 the parking structure, including a design that prevents office parking from being accessed from
7 Cartwright driveway in front of the office building. The Traffic Impact Analysis conducted is

8 deficient and assumes facts that contradict the Project plans and documents. Even
9 Respondent's Staff Report provides information at odds with the assumptions made in the
10 Traffic Impact Analysis. The traffic modeling analysis conducted in the Traffic Impact
11 Analysis did not include the retail component of the project. The Traffic Impact Analysis was
12 deficient and there are issues that could create adverse traffic conditions and undisclosed traffic
13 impacts from the Project that have not been properly considered or analyzed.
14 F. Failure to Analyze and Consider Adequate Noise Attenuation: The
15 Addendum recognizes noise issues, yet Respondent has not required or suggested any noise
16 attenuation or mitigation.

17 G. Failure to Analyze and Consider the Number of Bedrooms in the
18 Project: The Project proposes 52 two-bedroom units, of which 39 are described as two
19 bedroom plus den. Contrary to the City's Zoning Code, Respondent has failed to properly
20 account for the two bedroom plus den units. Petitioner is informed and believes and based
21 thereon alleges that RPI failed to provide Respondent with the requisite floor plans for the
22 units, SO as to avoid analysis.

23 H. Failure to Analyze and Consider Pedestrian Access: The Project plans
24 fail to address how pedestrians will travel from the existing office to the parking structure.
25 There is no discussion of how and where office employees and visitors will cross the drive
26 aisles.

Palmiari, Tyler, Wiener -15-
Wilheim & Waldron LLP
Altornays al VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

2311296.3

1 I. Failure to Analyze, Consider and Address the Greenhouse Gas
2 Mandates ("GHG Mandates"): Neither the Project nor the City's underlying environmental
3 documents comply with the provisions of Assembly Bill 32 (California Health & Safety Code
4 § 38500 et seq.), Executive Order No. S-3-05, California Resources Board Regulations
5 (collectively referred to as the "GHG Mandates"). The IBC FEIR, the underlying CEQA
6 document, is inadequate for use as a project EIR until such time as it is updated to come into
7 compliance with the GHG mandates, as interpreted by the California Supreme Court.
8 Likewise, the Project fails to comply with the applicable provisions of the Subdivision Map
9 Act which mandates the incorporation of feasible design features for passive and natural
10 heating and cooling. (Gov. Code § 66473.1.)

11 Violations of City Municipal Code, General Plan and Policies and the Subdivision
12 Map Act

13 49. Respondent is required to comply with its own Municipal Code, General Plan,
14 policies and procedures. Respondent's approval of the Project violated the City Municipal
15 Code, the City General Plan and the City's policies and procedures. Respondent could not
16 make the required findings necessary for the approval of the Project. In addition to the above,
17 Respondent's violations include (but are not limited to) the following:

18 A. The café and speakeasy exceed the threshold of accessory retail:
19 Zoning Code Section 3-5-2 defines "accessory retail" as "local-serving retail equal to a
20 maximum of two percent of the total aggregate square footage of residential unit living space
21 on the project site." Zoning Code Section 3-5.2A further limits accessory eating
22 establishments to a maximum of 3,000 square feet. Petitioner is informed and believes and
23 based thereon alleges that the café and speakeasy exceed the allowable threshold for accessory
24 retail. This defect further causes the parking calculations to be incorrect because the parking
25 was calculated by excluding the square footage of the incorrectly denominated "accessory
26 retail."

27 B. The Project does not meet parking standards of the Zoning Code:
28 The Staff Report for the Council states the office is allocated 402 parking spaces and refers to

Palmiari, Tylor, Wiener -16-
WHlhelm & Waldron L
Allorneye at Law VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
| 2311296.3

an additional 13 "surplus" spaces designated for office use. However, the allocation of the 13
2 "surplus" spaces is not discussed in any of the Project documents. It appears that it was added

3 by Staff solely to address the parking deficiencies raised by Petitioner because, at 103,700
4 square-feet of office, City Zoning Code Section 4-3.3 requires a minimum of 415 parking
spaces. Conveniently, the 13 "surplus" spaces--the only mention of which is in the Council
6 Staff Report--achieves the minimum required by the Zoning Code. Further, the Project site
7 plan does not comply with the parking dimension standards in Section 4-4-1 of the City Zoning
8 Code.

9 C. The Project does not meet Irvine engineering standards for two-way
10 driveway widths or roundabouts: The City requires a minimum of 28-foot width for two-
11 way driveways serving commercial uses. The Tentative Tract Map, however, does not show
12 driveway widths in violation of the City's Subdivision Manual. Other documents show a
13 driveway width of 26 feet for the two-way driveway. The City's Subdivision Manual provides
14 that an engineer's variance was required for any deviation from the City's standard driveway
15 requirements. No such application requesting the deviation was filed or sought and the City
16 did not approve any such deviation. Further, the design of automobile turnaround in various
17 locations are in conflict with the City Zoning Code standards and policies.

18 D. The Project does not provide a "drop-off" area: The City's IBC
19| Residential/Mixed Use Design Criteria specifies that "drop-off and pick-up locations should be
20 incorporated into the design of parking areas, as determined by an access study or part of a
21 larger traffic analysis to be submitted at the time of the discretionary case application." The
22 Project does not meet minimum design criteria for drop-off and pick-up locations.

23 E. The Project provides inadequate parking and the "administrative
24 relief" provided to the Project was not supported: As discussed, Respondent's approval
25 failed to consider the impacts on the parking for the office building. In addition, Respondent
26 failed to consider that employees and office visitors may be required to walk as much as 500
27 feet to their cars on upper levels of the parking structure, possibly several times each day. In

'Altorneys a I Law VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
2311296.3

P addition, employees and visitors must weave through turnarounds, plaza seating, drive aisles
2 and gates located between the office building and garage.

3 F. There is no support for the findings for approval of the Tentative
4 Tract Map: Respondent's approval of the Tentative Tract Map is invalid, including but not
5 limited to the following: The City's Zoning Code provides a mandatory requirement of an

6 owner's association for approval of a condominium. Here, there has been no compliance with
7 that mandatory requirement. Likewise, the Tentative Tract Map was approved without
8 adequate parking for condominiums. Further, as discussed above, there was no site-specific
9 analysis and consideration of the geotechnical risks and potential mitigation techniques for this
10 Project. As such, there is no support for the Tentative Tract Map resolution finding that
11 "[s]pecialized construction techniques are not known to have been used in the development of
12 this area in the past and are not anticipated to be required for this project."

13 G. The Project is inconsistent with the goals of the General Plan and
14 Irvine Business Complex Vision Plan: As discussed, the office building will be seriously
15 under-parked and located 500-feet away from employee parking in a competitive office a
16 environment. The lack of convenient parking conflicts with the City's goals for the IBC:
17 "Policy (a): Preserve a core area to protect the existing job base and provide for future job
18 growth."

19 H. The CUP does not include a Fire Master Plan as required by City
20 policies: PPP-6-3 requires "Prior to approval of a conditional use permit, project applicants
21 shall prepare a Fire Master Plan for submittal to the Orange County Fire Authority (OCFA)
22 consistent with OCFA Guideline B-09 (Fire Master Plans for Commercial and Residential
23 Development)." Petitioner is informed and believes and based thereon alleges that the Project
24 did not satisfy that mandatory requirement and that no written OCFA approval was obtained.
25 Instead, Respondent's Tentative Tract Map approval omitted standard condition 1.14 which
26 requires the submittal of a plan prior to conditional use permit approval.

Withalm & Waldron LLP
Altorneys VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

2311296.3

H I. The Tentative Tract Map fails to address shared use of facilities by
2 the office and condominiums: Tentative Tract Map Standard Condition 1.5 requires shared
3 access agreement, CC&Rs "which ensure that utilities, access, parking, landscape areas, and

4 drainage (including private catch basins) will be commonly shared and maintained." This
5 Project's facilities will be shared with an office building which has not been considered part of
6 the condominium map, and an adjacent residential structure. Maintenance of facilities serving
7 both the residential condominium and the office building on a single lot should have been
8 addressed. Instead, it was ignored by mere designation of the office as "not a part."
9 J. No administrative relief was requested for deviation from parking
10 standards for the office building and the modifications to the office building parking due
11 to the project was not addressed as a major CUP modification to the prior CUP:
12 Assuming 149,000 square-feet of office uses, the office would require 596 spaces under the
13 City Zoning Code. The parking structure only has 402 spaces designated for office parking.
14 Even at the lower reported square-footage for the office (103,700 square-feet), the office is
15 under-parked with fewer than 415 parking stalls. No variance was sought or obtained. No
16 administrative relief for shared parking was requested. No findings were made, pursuant to
17 City Zoning Code Section 4-6.3, relating to administrative relief for shared parking. Further,
18 there was no application to modify the existing conditional use permit for the parking structure
19 due to the significant changes as required by Zoning Code Section 2-19.
20 K.

21 The Water Quality Management Plan (WQMP) does not take into
account the potential future ownership of residential units: The WQMP considered a
22 "rental apartment community. As part of the approval process for a tentative tract map, the
23 City requires a WQMP to be submitted. Here, however, the WQMP considered a "rental
24 apartment community." It did not consider or analyze the potential future ownership of the
25 residential units. It also did not include or consider the office building or the 272-unit
26 residential building. Thus, the application was incomplete. Respondent's approval of the
27. incomplete and inadequate application was improper.

1 L. The Project was required to be processed with an amendment to the
2 General Plan and a Zone Change: Respondent failed to comply with its own policy and its
3 prior written and oral statements relating to the Cap. Instead, Respondent improperly and
4 illegally processed RPI's application and approved the Project without the requisite General
5 Plan amendment and zone change.

6 Propriety of Relief Under Code of Civil Procedure Section 1085, et seq. and/or

7 Section 1094.5, et seq.

8 50: Respondent has the legal duty in making its determinations to comply with the
9 applicable law governing such acts. In particular, Respondent has the legal and
10 nondiscretionary duty to act in accordance with the requirements of CEQA, the Guidelines, the
11 Planning and Zoning Law, the Subdivision Map Act, the City Municipal Code, the City's
12 General Plan, City policies and procedures and other applicable laws and regulations.
13 51. Respondent acted arbitrarily, capriciously, irrationally, unreasonably, and
14 without any or an adequate evidentiary basis in failing or refusing to comply with the
15 requirements of CEQA, the Guidelines, the Planning and Zoning Law, the Subdivision Map
16 Act, the City Municipal Code, the City's General Plan, City policies and procedures and other
17 applicable laws and regulations. At all times material hereto, Respondent had, and continues

18 to have, the ability to comply with its legal duties. Notwithstanding the efforts of Petitioner
19 and others to inform Respondent of its legal duties, and to induce Respondent to comply with
20 its legal duties, Respondent has failed and refused to perform these duties as described herein.

21 52. Petitioner has exhausted all available administrative remedies. There is no
22 provision known to Petitioner for any further administrative remedial action from the decision
23 of Respondent to approve the Project.
24 53. Respondent has prejudicially abused its discretion by approving the Project and
25 permitting the acts and omissions described herein to occur. Petitioner was entitled to review
26 of the Project by an impartial adjudicator. Petitioner is informed and believes and based
27 thereon alleges that Petitioner did not receive a fair hearing by an unbiased adjudicator. The
28 lack of fair hearing constitutes an abuse of discretion.

54. In acting and failing to act in the manner described above, Respondent has acted
2 in an arbitrary, capricious, and irrational manner lacking any reasonable basis, in violation of
3 Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1085, et seq.

4 55. Petitioner is beneficially interested in issuance of the peremptory writ of mandate
5 as prayed for hereafter. Petitioner will be seriously harmed if Respondent allows the Project to
6 proceed without first complying with applicable laws and regulations.

7 56. At all times material hereto, Respondent has been able to perform its duties and
8 obligations as demanded by Petitioner. Respondent has, however, failed and refused to
9 undertake its obligations. Respondent has failed and refused to require or to perform any of
10 the above, notwithstanding the substantial evidence presented by Petitioner and others that
11 such failures and refusals are contrary to law and will have adverse consequences on
12 Petitioner.

13 57. Alternatively, the decision of the City to approve the Project constitutes a final
14 decision as contemplated in Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.5, et seq.
15 58. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy at law other than the relief
16 sought in this petition. In acting and failing to act in the manner described above, Respondent
17 has prejudicially abused its discretion in approving the Project, in violation of Code of Civil
18 Procedure Section 1094.5, et seq.

19 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

20 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays as follows:

21 1. For a judgment granting a peremptory writ of mandate pursuant to Code of Civil
22 Procedure Section 1085, et seq. and/or Section 1094.5, et seq., commanding Respondent to set
23 aside and invalidate its approvals of the Project, and order Respondent to take no further steps
24 toward implementing the Project unless and until Respondent and RPI fully comply with
25 CEQA, The Guidelines, the City Municipal Code, General Plan, policies and procedures and
26 the Subdivision Map Act;

27 2. For reasonable attorneys' fees in addition to any other relief granted;

Re: Notice of Commencement of Action -Public Resources Code Section 21167.5 [Approvals for the "15 Degrees South Project" in the Irvine Business Complex]
Dear Ms. MeLaughlin:
Please take notice that the IRVINE COALITION POR THE ENVIRONMENT intends to commence an action against the City of Irvine and its City Council to set aside its approval of the so-called "15° South Projeot" project (the "Project") proposed for development by J & R Main Street, LLC, at 2525 Main Street. The litigation will challenge (among other things) the City's preparation and approval of an "Addendum" for the Project instead of an environmental impact report ("EIR") and will allege (among other things) the City's and its Council's violation of the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code $8 21000 et seq.), the State Guidelines for Implementing CEQA (Tit. 14, Cal. Code Regs., §§ 15000, et seq.) the Planning and Zoning Law (Gov. Code §§ 65000 et seq.), the Subdivision Map Act (Gov. Code 8§ 66410 et seq.), as well as the City's General Plan and Municipal Code. The grounds for these allegations were previously provided to the City's appointed and elected decision-making bodies by the members of IRVINE RESIDENTS FOR THE ENVIRONMENT and others during the administrative processing and review of the Project.
This notice is provided to you pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.5.

Enclosed please find a conformed copy of the Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate in the above-captioned action. This copy is provided to you in compliance with Public Resources Code section 21167.7, and Code of Civil Procedure section 388.
The litigation challenges the City of Irvine's land use entitlements granted in connection with the "15 Degrees South" project. The Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate alleges that, in approving the project, the City of Irvine and City Council for the City of Irvine violated the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code §§ 21000 et seq.), the State Guidelines for Implementing CEQA (Tit. 14, Cal. Code of Regs, §§ 15000, et seq.), as well as the State Planning and Zoning Law (Gov. Code §§ 65000 et seq.)
Please acknowledge receipt of the enclosed document. Unless you request otherwise, we will not serve on your office any documents other than this initial pleading and any amended or supplemental initial pleadings. Thank you for your attention to this matter, and please do not hesitate to call me if you would like to discuss this matter further.
Very trafy yours,

11 service address(es) listed on the attached Service List. The documents were transmitted before 5:00 p.m.
12 (MESSENGER) I served the document(s) by placing them in an envelope or package addressed

13 to the person(s) listed on the attached Service List and providing them to a professional messenger service for service. A declaration by the messenger will be provided by separate Proof of Service.
14 X
15 (UNITED STATES MAIL) I cnclosed the document(s) in a scaled cnvelope or a package addressed to the person(s) listed on the attached Service List. I placed the envelope for collection and mailing, following our ordinary business practices. I am readily familiar with 16 this firm's practice of collection and processing mail. Under that practice it would be deposited

17 with the United States postal service on that same day in the ordinary course of business in a sealed envelope addressed as indicated on the Service List, with postage fully prepaid, or in the

18 alternative. I deposited the sealed envelope with the United States Postal Service, with the postage fully prepaid.

19 Place of Mailing: Irvine, California.

20 I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the foregoing is true and correct.

Executed on March 5, 2018, at Irvine, California.
