16

17 Respondent and Defendant. (PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE §S 21167, 21168, 21168.5; CGP §S 1085, 1094.5)

18 By this verified petition, Potitioner and, Plaintiff Discovery Builders, Inc.
19 ("Discovery," "Plaintiff," or "Petitioner") alleges as follows:
20

21 INTRODUCTION

1, Discovery seeks a declaration by this Court that Respondent and
22 Defendant City of Antioch ("City") must fully comply with the requirements of the
23 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"; Pub. Resources Code §§ 21000 et seq.) in
24 connection wilh its review and approval of a General Plan Land Use Element Update
25 ("Land Use Element Update"), and the City must complete a CEQA-compliant, public
26 environmental review process before attempting to adopt a Land Use Element Update.
27 2. The City improperly pjecemealed the General Plan Land Use Element
28 Update into at least three segments: the Land Use Element Update itself, a Downtown

14180950.1 VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

B4

1 Specific Plan, and the potential Sand Creek Focus Area plan. These plans must be
2 evaluated together due to the linkage between the projects. CEQA mandates that
3 activities that are integral parts of the same project be analyzed and evaluated together

4 to ensure environmental impacts are properly identified and considered. (Tuolumne
5 County Citizens for Responsible Growth; Inc. v. City of Sonora (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th
6 1214, 1228.)

7 3. The City improperly prepared and certified a Land Use Element Update
8 Initial Study/Addendum to the 2003 General Plan EIR ("Land Use Element Addendum")
9 that was purportedly "tiered" off of an environmental impact report ("EIR") for the 2003
10 General Plan ('"General Plan EIR"). This tiering is inadequate under CEQA because of (1)
11 substantial changes to the City since adoption of the 2003 General Plan and certification
12 of the Land Use Element Addendum, and (2) the failure of the City to examine new,
13 significant impacts of the Land Use Element Update.
14 4. Further, the Cily abüsed its discretion by certifying the Land Use Element
15 Addendum, because there is substantial evidence that the Addendum will result in new
16 significant impacts to the environment that were not identified, analyzed, or mitigated in
17 the Géneral Plan EIR or the Addendum, and that the Land Use Element Update will
18 result in a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant impacts.
19 5. The City also abused its discretion and failed to proceed in a manner
20 required by law because the City did not adequately respond to Discovery's comments to
21 the Land Use Element Addendum, in violation of CEQA public participation and
22 information disclosure provisions.

23 6. Accordingly, Discovery seeks a peremptory writ of mandate pursuant to
24 Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 and/or section 1094.5 setting aside the certification
25 of the City's Land Use Element Addendum and adoption of the Land Use Element
26 Update, and ordering the City to prepare a subsequent or supplemental EIR that fully
27 analyzes all significant impacts of the Land Use Element Update in conjunction with the
28 Downtown Specific Plan and Sand Creek Focus Area before adopting a Land Use
-2-

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1  Element Update.

2 7. Discovery seeks a declaration by this Court that the City must fully comply
3 with the requirements of CEQA in its review of the Land Use Element Update, and that
4 the City must prepare a CEQA-compliant EIR before adopting a Land Use Element
5 Update.

8. Discovery seeks Injunctive relief by this Court enjoining the City from
7 implementing the Land Use Element Update, which plan was adopted in violation of
8 CEQA.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

10 9. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to CEQA, Public Resources Code
11 sections 21167, 21168, and 21168.5, and Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and

12 1094.5.

13 10. The City of Antioch is located withjn Contra Costa County, and venue is
14 proper in Contra Costa County pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 394(a).
15 PARTIES

16 11. Petitioner and Plaintiff Discovery Builders, Inc. is a California corporation
17 with its principal place of business in Contra Costa County, Discovery owns property
18 within the Land Use Element Update area and conducts business in Contra Costa
19 County and the City of Antloch.
20 12. The City of Antioch is a municipality incorporated in 1872 and the lead
21 agency under CEQA for the Land Use Element Update. On January 23, 2018, the
22 Antioch City Council certified the Land Use Element Addendum and adopted the Land
23  Use Element Update. On January 29, 2018, the City filed a Notice of Determination for
24 the Land Use Element Update with the Contra Costa County Clerk and the State Office of
25 Planning and Research.

26 STANDING

27 13. Petitioner and Plaintiff Discovery has standing to bring this petition and
28 complaint because it is it the owner of real property located within the Land Use Element
-3-

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Update area. Therefore, Discovery has a geographical nexus to the Land Use Element
2 Update and will be affected by the Land Use Element Update's environmental impacts.

3 14. Discovery has exhausted its administrative remedies, by objections
4  intorposed in writing during the administrative proceedings leading to the adoption of the
5 Land Use Element Update, including without limitation written comments submitted to the
6 City's Mayor and City Councilmembers on November 28, 2017, December 12, 2017, and

7 January 23, 2018.
8 15. Discovery has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by
9 previously serving by mail a Notice of Commencernent of Action described in California
10 Public Resources Code section 21167 upon the City. The Notice and Proof of Service of
11 the Notice have been filed with this petition.
12 FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

13 16. The City adopted the 2003 General Plan on November 24, 2003. The City
14 prepared the General Plan EIR (State Clearinghouse No. 2003072140) in July 2003,
15  which was certified by the City Council on November 24,2003.
16 17. Section 4 of the 2003. General Plan contains the Land Use Element,
17 described therein as "the cornerstone of the General Plan, setting forth Antioch's
18 fundamental land use policy and directing development." (2003 General Plan, p. 4-1.)
19 The Land Use Element primarily addresses "type, intensity, location, and character of
20 land uses that will be permitted" in the City. (Id.)
21 18. Since the General Plan was adopted in 2003, there have been significant
22 growth and changes to land use policy in the City of Antioch. These changes include, but
23 are not limited to, the annexation of the Tuscany Meadows project into the City of
24 Pittsburg; approval of Measure K to include Roddy Ranch and a portion of the Gnochio
25 Property within the Urban Lirnit Line and City limits; and a development project known as
26 "The Ranch," consisting of approximately 551.5 acres in what is known as the Sand
27 Creek Focus Area. (Land Use Element Update, p. 4-3; Sept. 12, 2017 Staff Report to the
28 Planning Commission for Consideration at the Sept. 20 Meeting, Agenda Item #2.)

VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND
14180950.1 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

19. On August 23, 2016, the Planning Division of the Antioch Community

2 Development Department presented a Draft Downtown Specific Plan to the City Council.
This Draft Downtown Specific Plan was revised and presented to the Planning
4 Commission on September 21, 2016, According to the Staff Report provided to the City
Council:

6 The Downtown Specific Plan is intended to serve as a comprehensive

7 land use document for the downtown area. Presently, the area IS regulated through a series of planning documents [e.g., the General Plan Land Use Element], municipal code sections, and similar efforts that can
8 be cumbersome and even conflicting. The purpose of this Downtown
9 Specific Plan is to combine the best elements of these past documents, current information, and future trends, to create a single a source for

10 development policy and programs for Downtown Antioch. This document is designed to be streamlined, accessible, and simple to encourage
11 development and reinvestment in Downtown Antioch.

12 (Staff Report, Update on Downtown Specific Plan, August 23, 2016, p. 2.)
13 20. On February 14, 2017, the City released to the public an addendum to the
14 2003 General Plan' EIR for the Downtown Specific Plan ("Downtown Plan Addendum").
15 The Downtown Plan Addendum analyzes changes in density and land use patterns
16 relative to what is permitted under the 2003 General Plan Land Use Element and zoning
17 regulations. The Downtown Plan Addendum notes that the Downtown Plan is intended to
18 "recognize current conditions and facilitate near term improvements and investments."
19 (Downtown Pian Addendum, p. 2.) The Downtown Plan Addendum states that "[these
20 efforts are expected to strengthen the real estate market and eventually spur larger-scale
21 projects." (Id.) The City Council approved and adopted the Downtown Specific Plan on
22 February 13, 2018.
23 21. On November 28, 2017, City staff presented a dratt Land Use Element
24 Update to the City Council. The Land Use Element Update proposed to significantly alter
25 the land use policies contained in the 2003 General Plan and analyzed in the 2003
26 General Plan EIR. The amendments in the Land Use Element Update include but are not
27 limited to the following: rezoning of fifteen acres of land from Light Industrial to High
28 Density Residential Use; allowing for high density residential projects within commercial
-5-

1 land use areas; and replacing the focus planning area (areas identified for focused policy
2 analysls and direction) for the Rivertown/Urban Waterfront with a focus area for the
3 "Downtown Specific Plan Foous Area." (Land Use Element Update, pp. 4-32 to 4-43.)
4 The Land Use Element Update also includes reductions in the number of single family
5 dwelling unlts (3,972 units), multi-family dwelling units (3,035 units), and
6 commercial/office. square footage (19,956,460 square feet). (ld., pp. 4-17 to 4-22; Sept.
7 21, 2017 Traffic Considerations & Environmental Impact Report Consistenoy Review, p.
8 2.)

9 22. In October: 2017, the City released an addendum to the 2003 EIR analyzing
10 the proposed amendments to the General Plan Land Use Element ("Land Use Element
11 Addendum'). The Land Use Element Addendum identifies and purports to analyze
12 various changes in land use in the City of Antioch since the adoption af the 2003 -EIR.
13 The Land Use Element Addendum references both the Downtown Plan Addendum and a
14 separate addendum for the Sand Creek Focus Area, stating that "[t]he City is currently
15 preparing an amendment to the Antioch General Plan to reflect recent developments in
16 the Sand Creek Focus Area and current expectations for future development." (Land
17 Use Addendum, p. 3.0-7.) The Land Use Element Addendum states that the
18 development (of up to 4,000 residential units) in the Sand Creek Focus Area "would be
19 wholly apart from the [Land Use Element UpdateJ" and that the City "would evaluate the
20 | potential impacts [of development in the Sand Creek Focus Area] separately." (Id.)

21 23. Based on this unduly narrow, piecemeal approach to environmental review,
22 the Land Use Element Addendum concludes that there are "no substantial changes
23 proposed by the project or in the circumstances in which the project would be undertaken
24 that require major revisions of the 2003 EIR, or preparation of a new subsequent or
25 supplemental EIR, due to the involvement of new significant environmental effects or a
26 substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant effects." (Land Use
27 Element Addendum, p. 1.0-2.)

28 24. By letter dated November 28, 2017, Discovery timely submitted detailed
-6-
VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND
14180950.1 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1  comments to the City describing the legal inadequacy of the addenda for the Land Use
2 Element Update and the Downtown Specific Plan. This letter detailed the insufficiency of
3 the addenda in light of the substantial changes made to the Land Use Element of the
4 2003 General Plan and the changed circumstances since approval of the 2003 General

5 Plan.

6 25. By letter dated December 12, 2017, Discovery submitted additional

7 comments to the City regarding the legal inadequacy of the Land Use Element
8 Addendum, detailing that the City improperly segmented the addenda for the Land Use
9 Element Update and the Downtown Specific Plan in violation of CEQA, and the failure of
10 both addenda to analyze new or potential impacts.
11 26. By letter dated January 23, 2018, Discovery again submitted comments to
12 the City, reiterating the failure of the Land Use Element Addendum and Downtown
13 Specific Plan Addendum to comply with CEQA on the grounds that (1) the separation of
14 the Land Use Element Update and Downtown Specific Plan constitute improper
15 segmenting of environmental review, (2) a supplemental EIR was required because of
16 substantial chänges to the 2003 General Plan and new significant impacts to the
17 environment, and (3) the City failed to address Discovery's comments regarding the Land
18 Use Element Addendum.

19 27. On January 23, 2018, the City Council voted to adopt Resolution No.
20 2018/14, approving the Land Use Element Addendum, and Resolution No. 2018/15,
21 adopting the Land Use Element Update and thereby amending the Land Use Element of
22 the 2003 General Plan.

23 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

24 - [Writ of Mandate - Violation of CEQA]
25 A. The City Improperly Segmented Environmental Analysis of the Land
26 Use Element Update.

27 28. Discovery refers to and herein incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1
28 through 27, as if stated in full herein.
-7-

14180950.† VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

29, CEQA requires that an environmental impact analysis must evaluate

2 activities that are a "reasonably foreseeable consequence" of a proposed project to make
3 sure that an environmental document examines the full impacts that will result from

4 project approval. (Banning Ranch Conservancy v City of Newpört Beach (2012) 211

5 Cal.App.4th 1209, 1224.) CEQA prohibits the "piecemealing" of single large projects into
6 smaller projects that fail to consider the cumulative impacts of the project as a whole. (ld.)

7 A lead agency cannot avoid its obligation to prepare an EIR by segmenting projects into
8 smaller pieces which, considered individually, may be found to have no significant impact

9 on the environment. (Tuolumne County Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. v City of
10 Sonora (2007) 155 Cal.App. 4th 1214; Association for a Cleaner Envt. v Yosemite
11 Community College Dist. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 629, 638.)
12 30. The Land Use Element Update and Downtown Specific Plan must be
13 evaluated together, and in connection with other changes to land use in and around the.
14 Cily of Antioch, including but not limited to development in the San Creek Focus Area.
15 The Land Use Element Update is a legal prerequisite to adoption of the Downtown Plan,
16 and consistency between the two documents is required. (Antioch City Council Report,
17 December 12, 2017, Agenda Item #3, p. 2.) As stated by the City's own staff report, the
18 Downtown Specific Plan "was delayed until the Citywide General Plan Land Use Element
19 update was ready for consideration." (Antioch City Council Report, December 12,2017,
20 Agenda Item #3, p. 2.) The Downtown Specific Plan is incorporated into the Land Use
21 Element Update, and therefore the impacts of the Downtown Specific Plan are
22 reasonably foreseeable impacts of approval of the Land Use Element Update. (Land
23 Element Use Update, pp. 4-33 to 4-42.)
24 31. The City abused its discretion, and failed to proceed as required by law, in
25 failing to examine the potential impacts of the Land Use Element Update, the Downtown
26 Specific Plan, and the Sand Creek Focus Area together, unlawfully deferring analysis of
27 cumulative impacts of these projects.

14180950.1 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 B. The City Improperly Relied on the Out-of-Date 2003 General Plan EIR and Failed to Adequately Examine Significant Impacts of the Land Use Element Update.

32. Pursuant to CEQA, if an agency determines there is substantial evidence
4 that any aspect of the project, individually or cumulatively, may cause a significant effect
5 on the environment, the lead agency must (1) prepare an EIR, (2) use a previously
6 prepared EIR which adequately analyzes the relevant project, or (3) determine which

7 effects were adequately examined by an earlier EIR or negative declaration pursuant to

8 an appropriate CEQA process, and which effects must be analyzed in a subsequent EIR
9 or negative declaration. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15063(b)(1).)
10 33. An agency may rely on an addendum to a previously prepared EIR only if
11 "some changes or additions are necessary but none of the conditions described in
12 Section 15162 calling for preparation of a subsequent EIR have occurred." (Cal. Code
13 Regs. tit. 14, § 15164.) An addendum is permissible if "only minor technical changes or
14 additions are necessary or none of the conditions described in Section 15162 calling for
15 the preparation of a subsequent EIR or negative declaration have occurred." (ld.) Those
16 conditions include:

17 (1) Substantial changes are proposed in the project which will require
18 major revisions of the previous EIR or negative declaration due to the involvement of new significant environmental effects or a

19 substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant effects; [or]

20 (2) Substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under

21 which the project is undertaken which will require major revisions of the previous EIR or Negative Declaration due to the involvement of
22 new significant environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant effects.
23 (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15162(@)(1)-(2).)

24 34. The City abused its discretion, and failed to proceed as required by law, by
25 failing to recognize substantial evidence that the Land Use Element Update may cause

26 new significant impacts to the environment. The Land Use Element Update makes
27 substantial, significant changes to the 2003 General Plan, including but not limited to the
28 following:

-9

14180950.1 VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MÄNDATE

a. Rezoning of fifteen acres of land from Light Industrial to High Density
2 Residential Use;

3 b. Calling for high density residential projects within commercial land
4 LISe areas (Land Use Element Update, p. 4-32.);

5 C. Replacing the Rivertown/Urban Waterfront Focus Area with the

6 Downtown Specific Plan Föcus Area (ld., pp. 4-33 to 4-43.); and
7 d Including reductions in the number of single family dwelling units
8 (3,972 units), multi-family dwelling units (3,035 units), and

9 commercial/office square footage (19,956,460 square feet).
10  (ld., pp. 4-17 to 4-22; Sept. 21, 2017 Traffic Considerations & Environmental Impact
11 Report Consistency Review, p. 2.)
12 35. Despite these substantial changes to the Land Use Element of the 2003
13 General Plan, the City found that the Land Use Element Addendum "would involve only
14 minor changes," stating that "[there are no substantial changes proposed by the project
15 or in the circumstances in which the project would be undertaken that require major
16 revisions of the 2003 EIR, or preparation of a new subsequent or supplemental EIR, due
17 to the involvement of new significant environmental effects or a substantial increase in
18 the severity of previously identified significant effects." (Land Use Element Addendum, p.
19 1.0-2.)

20 36. The City's certification of the Land Use Element Addendum was an
21 impermissible abuse of discretion, because there was substantial evidence, based on the
22 entire record, that the Land Use Element Update may have significant environmental
23 effects. (See Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of California
24 (1993) 6 Cal.4th 1112, 1123.) These effects include, but are not limited to, the following:
25 Air Quality, Biological Resources, Hazards and Hazardous Materials, Land Use, Noise,
26 Transportation and Traffic, and cumulative impacts. Therefore, the City abused its
27 discretion in approving the Land Use Element Update without preparing a subsequent or
28 supplemental EIR.
-10-
VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND 14180950.1 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

37. The City also failed to properly evaluate substantial changes to the land use
2 in the City of Antioch in the 14 years since the adoption of the 2003 General Plan EIR.
3 These changes include, but are not limited to, the annexation of the Tuscany Meadows

4 area into the City of Pittsburg; approval of Measure K.to include Roddy Ranch and a
5 portion of the Gnochio Property within the Urban Limit Line and City limits; and a
6 development project known as "The Ranch," consisting of approximately 551.5 acres in
7 what is known as the Sand Creek Focus Area. The City abused its discretion, and failed

8 to proceed in a manner required by law, by failing to prepare a subsequent or
9 supplemental EIR to evaluate new significant environmental effects a or a substantial
10 increase in the severity of previously identified significant effects due to these changed
11 circumstances.

12 C. The City Failed to Comply With the Public Participation and
13 Information Disclosure Provisions of CEQA.

14 38. CEQA mandates that agencies "solicit and respond to comments from the
15 public and from other agencies concerned with the project." (Cal, Code Regs., tit. 14, §
16 15002().) The policy purpose of environmental review under CEQA is to demonstrate to
17 the public that an agency has analyzed and considered the environmental implications of
18| its action. (ld. § 15003(d).)
19 39. The City has failed to respond to Discovery's comments regarding the Land
20 Use Element Update and Land Use Element Addendum. Although Discovery submitted
21  written comments to the City on November 28, 2017, December 12, 2017, and January
22 23, 2018 regarding the inadequacy of the Land Use Element Addendum and the
23 substantial changes made to the 2003 General Plan through the Land Use Element
24 | Update, the City did not address, in the January 23, 2018 Staff Report recommending
25 adoption of the Land Use Element Addendum or elsewhere, Discovery's substantive
26 comments, concluding without analysis that "most of the proposed changes are minor
27 and generally inconsequential," and "a few significant actions, including the Tuscany
28 Meadows Annexation by Pittsburg and the sale of the Sierra Vista subdivision, greatly

1 reduce the total build-out projections for the City of Antioch." (Staff Report to City Council
2 Meeting on January 23, 2018, Agenda Item #4.)

3 40. The City prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to act in a manner
required by law by insufficiently responding to Discovery's comments and objections to
5 the Land Use Element Update and Land Use Element Addendum.

6 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

7 [Declaratory Relief]
8 41. Discovery refers to and herein incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1
9 if through 40, as if stated in full herein.

10 42. An actual controversy exists between Discovery and the City in that
11 Discovery contends that the City improperly segmented the Land Use Element Update
12 from other integral parts of the project, including the Downtown Specific Plan, and that
13 these projects must be evaluated together in compliance with CEQA, whereas the City
14 contends it met its legal obligations pursuant to CEQA.

15 43. An actual controversy exists between Discovery and the City in that
16 Discovery contends that the City did not prepare and certify the Land Use Element
17 Addendum in compliance with CEQA, and that an EIR is required to evaluate significant
18 environmental impacts of the Land Use Element Update, whereas the City contends it

4 I through 45, as if stated in full herein.

5 47. Discovery owns land in the area covered by the Land Use Element Update.
6 Discovery's property within the area will be adversely affected due to the environmental
7 impacts of the adoption of the Land Use Element Update as a direct result of the City's

9 limited to the City's failure to adequately examine significant impacts of the Land Use
10 Element Update.
11 48. Such conduct by the City is wrongful and violates California law as
12  previously alleged herein,

17 Discovery has no adequate remedy at law for the damages to be sustained if the City
18 continues its wrongful act of implementing the Land Use Element Update.

9 Discovery restraining the City, and its agents, employees, officers, and representatives
