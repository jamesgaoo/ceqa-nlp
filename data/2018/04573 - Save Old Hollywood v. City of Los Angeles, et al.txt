VERIFIED PRTITION FOR WRITOR MANDATR

Petitioner, SAVE OLD HOLLYWOOD ("Petitioner"), alleges:

1. The project is a proposed small lot subdivision located at 6517-6533 West
Lexington Avenue, Los Angeles, CA ("Project"). The Projects consists of the demolition of three
single family homes and the construction of eighteen (8) small lots for the purposes of a Small
Lot Subdivision.

2. Petitioner, Save Old Hollywood ("Petitioner"), is an unincorporated association

7 whose purpose is to promote the social welfare and environment in the City of Los Angeles.

8 Petitioner and its respective members have a direct and substantial beneficial interest in ensuring
that Respondent complies with laws relating to environmental protection. Petitioner and its
10 respective members are adversely affected by Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA in

g 11  approving the Project. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because Channel Law Group; d17 L-Z06 12 Petitioner and its members' aesthetic and environmental interests are directly and adversely

8 euns "pAja eUJySIM 0078 13 affected by Respondent's' approval of the Project.
'SIIH Áuereg 14 3. Respondent, City of Los Angeles ("Respondent"), is a charter city incorporated
15 under the laws of the State of California. The City is the lead agency under the California
16 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA").
17 4. Real Party in Interest, 6533 LEX LLC ("Real Party in Interest" or "Developer"),
18 is a limited liability company that is developing the Project.

19 5. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Real Parties sued herein
20 as DOES 1-25, inclusive, and therefore sues these Real Parties by such fictitious names.

21 Petitioner will amend this Petition to allege the true names and capacities of fictitiously named
22 Real Parties in Interest. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that each
23 Respondent designated herein as a DOE has some responsibility for the events and happenings
24 alleged in this Petition.
25 6. On February 6, 2018, the City of Los Angeles approved a Vesting Tentative Tract
26 Map and Zoning Administrators Adjustment in order to facilitate the Project. The City
27 erroneously determined that the Project was exempt from CEQA as a Class 32 project.
28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

7. This action has been brought within 35 days of the City's determination that the
2 Project was exempt from CEQA. The City filed a Notice of Exemption for the Project on
3 February 16, 2018.

8. This action arises under CEQA and its implementing regulations, which are
5 prescribed by the Secretary of the California Resources Agency to be followed by all state and

6 local agencies when undertaking projects subject to CEQA. (Pub. Resources Codeg 21000 et
seq.; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15000 et seq.) This Court has jurisdiction over the matters
8 alleged in this Petition pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, and Public Resources
9 Code section 21168.5. In the alternative, this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil
10 Procedure section 1094.5 and Public Resources Code section 21168.

11 9. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 394(a) venue is proper in "the county § d'11'dnoJg MET jouuByo LLZ06 12 in which the city or local agency is situated." Venue is proper in this Court because Respondent
13 & is located in the County of Los Angeles.

10. Members of Petitioner and other interested persons made oral and written á 14

Ájarea 15 comments on the Project and raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this petition.
16

17 CEQA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS
18 11. California Environmental Quality Act is California's broadest environmental
19 | law. CEQA helps to guide public agencies such as the City during issuance of permits and
20 approval of projects. Courts have interpreted CEQA to afford the fullest protection of the
21 environment within the reasonable scope of the statutes. CEQA applies to all discretionary
22 projects proposed to be conducted or approved by a City, including private projects requiring
23 discretionary government approval. See California Public Resources Code, sections 21000.
24 21178, and Title 14 Cal. Code Regs., section 753, and Chapter 3, sections 15000 - 15387.
25 12. "CEQA broadly defines a 'project' as 'an activity which may cause either a direct
26 physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the
27 environment, and that involves the issuance to a person of a lease, permit, license, certificate,
28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

or other entitlement for use by one or more public agencies.' [Citation.] The statutory definition

2 is augmented by the [CEQA] Guidelines [Cal.Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15000 et seq.], which define
a 'project' as "the whole of an action, which has potential for resulting in either a direct
physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the
environment...." Tuolumne County Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. v. City of Sonora
(2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 1214, 1222, 66 Cal.Rptr.3d 645 (Tuolumne County). This includes all
phases of a project that are reasonably foreseeable, and all related projects that are directly linked
8 to the project. (CEQA Guidelines section 15378).

13. A strong presumption in favor of requiring preparation of an Environmental
10 Impact Report ("EIR") is built into CEQA which is reflected in what is known as the "fair
11
d11 'dno9 MET euuBYs § argument" standard, under which an agency must prepare an EIR whenever substantial evidence

9021' # MA0S VPNSTIHMUSMIDA GOZB 12 in the record supports a fair argument that a project may have a significant effect on the
13 environment. No Oil, Inc. V. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75, 82; Friends of "B" St.
14 v. City of Haywood (1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 988, 1002.
Beverly 15 14. "The EIR is the primary means of achieving the Legislature's considered
16| declaration that it is the policy of this state to 'take all action necessary to protect, rehabilitate,
17 and enhance the environmental quality of the state.' [Citation. ] The EIR is therefore "the heart of
18| CEQA.' [Citations.] An EIR is an "environmental "alarm bell" whose purpose it is to alert the
19 public and its responsible officials to environmental changes before they have reached ecological
20 points of no return.™* Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of California
21 (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392.
22 15. Under CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, if a project is not exempt and may cause

23 a significant effect on the environment, the agency must prepare an EIR. PRC §§ 21100, 21151;
24 14 Cal. Code Regs. §15064(a)(1), (f)(1). "Significant effect upon the environment" is defined as
25 "a substantial or potentially substantial adverse change in the environment." PRC $21068; 14 Cal
26 Code Regs §15382. A project "may" have a significant effect on the environment if there is a
27 "reasonable probability" that a it will result in a significant impact. No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
(Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act)
16. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs of this
Petition.
10 17. The City determined that the Project was exempt from CEQA as a Class 32
11
§ project. The Class 32 exemption is reserved for certain types of "infill" projects. According to d71 'dnoJg MET euueyo +LZ06 12 auns "PALE BJJYSIM 0OZ8 the State CEQA Guidelines, a project must meet the following conditions to qualify for this
13 8
SII!H Kuereg 14 (a) The project is consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all exemption:

15 applicable general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and
16 regulations.
17 (b) The proposed development occurs within city limits on a project site of no
18 more than five acres substantially surrounded by urban uses.
19 (c) The project site has no value as habitat for endangered, rare or threatened
20 species.
21 (d) Approval of the project would not result in any significant effects relating to
22 traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality.
23 (e) The site can be adequately served by all required utilities and public services.
24 18. The Project is not eligible for the Class 32 exemption for a variety of reasons.
25 Among other things, the Project does not comply with local zoning requirements. In fact, the
26 applicant sought a Zoning Administrator's Adjustment in order to exceed the applicable height
27 limit.
28

5

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

19. For the aforementioned reasons, Respondent committed a prejudicial abuse of
discretion and failed to proceed in a manner required by law by failing to conduct the required
3 additional environmental analysis under CEQA before approving the Project.

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
(Violation of the Los Angeles City Charter and Los Angeles Municipal Code)

20. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs of this
o Petition.

21. The applicant in this instance has sought a zoning administrator's adjustment to
10 permit a maximum building height of 33 feet 6 inches in lieu of the maximum height of 30 feet
11
cha nnisihlle si Crouguila 500 in the applicable zone and to permit a lot area density of 1,200 square feet per dwelling unit in
44Z06 2406 VANE ILH ,AS ID A 028 Beverly Hills, 12 lieu of 1,500 square feet per dwelling unit in the applicable zone.
13 22. Both the Deputy Advisory Agency and the Area Planning Commission erred
14 when they granted the aforementioned adjustment because they did not make the required
15 findings for variances as required by City Charter Section 562. To the extent that Los Angeles
16 Municipal Code Section 12.28 purports to alter or delete the findings requirements of Charter
17 Section 562, LAMC Section 12.28 violates the City Charter and is therefore unenforceable.
18 23. The City of Los Angeles was sued on an almost identical issue in the case known
19 as Kottler et al. v. City of Los Angeles et al., Los Angeles Superior Court No. BS154184. In that
20 case the petitioner challenged the City's adjustment procedures and the Honorable Robert H.
21 O'Brien granted the petition for writ of mandate and invalidated the adjustment on the grounds
22 that the decision was not supported by the necessary findings.
23 24. The City cannot approve the instant small lot subdivision because the adjustment
24 is similarly not supported by the necessary findings outlined in the City Charter.

Dear City of Los Angeles:
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under California Public Resources Code section 21167.5, that Petitioner, Save Old Hollywood (*Petitioner"), intends to immediately file a Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint ("Petition") under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") against the City of Los Angeles ("City" or "Respondent"). 6533 Lex LLC will be named as a Real Party in Interest.

Among other things, the Petition will request that the court direct the City to vacate and rescind the project approvals, the determination that the project is exempt CEQA and to otherwise comply with CEQA. Also, the Petition will seek Petitioners' cost
and attorneys' fees.
