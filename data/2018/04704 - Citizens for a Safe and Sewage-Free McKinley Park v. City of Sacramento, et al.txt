19 Plaintiff and Petitioner CITIZENS FOR A SAFE AND SEWAGE-FREE MCKINLEY BY FAX

20 PARK ("Citizens") complains and alleges as follows:

21 1. McKinley Park, located in historic East Sacramento, is the oldest park in
22 Sacramento and one of the oldest parks in the United States. Since 1871, Sacramento residents

23 and visitors have enjoyed this invaluable resource, and as of October 18, 2018, McKinley Park is
24 listed in the National Register of Historic Places. New generations-including the elderly and
25 children from surrounding communities and the adjacent day care facility--continue to gather at
26 the park to enjoy its benefits and to rely upon the trees, grass, water features, and recreational
27 facilities provided by McKinley Park.
28 ///

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

2, On October 9, 2018, the City Council of Sacramento approved a plan a to tear up

2 over 76,000 square feet of McKinley Park-including historic canopy trees and recreation

3 facilities-in order to dig a pit that will be at least 255 feet long, 300 feet wide, and approximately
4 20 feet deep. Respondents claim the dig, which will cause irreparable damage to the park, is

5 necessary to install a concrete "vault" under the park that will store approximately one million

6 cubic feet-over 7.4 million gallons-of sewage and stormwater (the "Sewage Vault").' According

7 Respondents, the purpose of the Sewage Vault is to "reduce" the amount of sewage and
8 stormwater that flows .up and out of the City's antiquated combined sewer system and into
0 McKinley Park and the surrounding neighborhood during significant weather events.

10 3..  Respondents acknowledge that the Sewage Vault will not stop the flow of sewage

11 into the park, surrounding public streets, private yards, driveways and homes during significant
12 storins. East Sacramento will continue to be inundated by sanitary sewer and storm flows even if
13 the Sewage Vault is constructed as planned, particularly as climate change increases the frequency

14 and severity of storms in the area in the coming years, The Sewage Vault will not protect

15
*: residents of East Sacramento from the public health and safety hazards that will continue to be

16 caused by existing contaminated water flows.

17 4. Respondents further admit that to solve the problem permanently, the antiquated

18 combined system would need 1o separate sewage from stormwater, as is done in other parts of

19 Sacramento and throughout the country. Nevertheless, despite widespread public opposition to
20 the Sewage Vault--including from the very. residents that the City claims this project will
21 protect-the City has refused to pursue a separate stormwater/sewage system that would solve
22 East Sacramento's flooding problem permanently, Moreover, the Sewage Vault itself will cause
23 significant impacts that have not been adequately disclosed, studied, or mitigated in the Project's
24 environmental import report ("EIR"), as required by the California Environmental Quality Act
25 ("CEQA").

26 The City promotes this project using the term "water vault," which is both incorrect and
27 misleading. The pipes that would feed the proposed Sewage Vault are from the City's combined sewer system, not the City's water pipes.
28

2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

5. Notwithstanding McKinley Park's unique history and its value to the community,

2 Respondents approved the Project without adequately considering and mitigating the Project's
3 environmental impacts, without giving sufficient consideration to feasible alternatives to the
4|| Project, and without giving responsible agencies and the public a meaningful opportunity to
5 review and comment on significant changes made to the Project after the close of the comment
6 period. On or about October 9, 2018, Respondents violated CEQA by certifying the EIR and

7 approving the preliminary design plans for the McKinley Water Vault Project (the "Project").

8 6. Specifically, the City voted to approve the Project despite the EIR's failure to

9 adequately analyze and propose mitigation measures to address the Project's impacts on (i)
10 aesthetics and visual resources; (ii) air quality; (iii) biological resources; (iv) cultural resources;

11 (v) geology and soils; (vi) hazards and hazardous materials; (vii) hydrology; (viii) noise and
12 vibration; and (ix) transportation and traffic. In addition, the EIR fails to comply with CEQA

13 because its project description is legally deficient, and it fails to adequately discuss reasonable and
4 feasible Project alternatives. Finally, the City violated CEQA by failing to adequately respond to

5 comments on the draft EIR, and to recirculate the EIR for public review and comment after

16 significant new information was added to the EIR following the public review period.

17 7. Accordingly, a peremptory writ should issue commanding the City to set aside its
18 approval of the Project.
19 THE PARTIES

20 8. Petitioner and Plaintiff Citizens is, and at all relevant times was, an unincorporated
21 association whose members reside in or around the City of Sacramento. Citizens was created to
22 advocate for the preservation and protection of historic McKinley Park and its surrounding
23 neighborhoods. The interests of Citizens are, and will continue to be, adversely affected and
24 injured by Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA by approving the Project without, inter
25 alia: (i) adequately analyzing and proposing mitigation measures to address the Project's
26 environmental impacts, including impacts on aesthetics and visual resources, air quality,

27 biological resources, cultural resources, geology and soils, hazards and hazardous materials,
28 hydrology, noise and vibration, and transportation and traffic; (ii) providing a legally sufficient

3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 project description; (iii) adequately considering and analyzing adequate and feasible potential
2 alternatives; (iv) adequately responding to comments on the DEIR; and (v) recirculating the EIR in

3 order to allow public comment and consideration of significant new information.

4 9. Respondent City of Sacramento is, and at all times herein mentioned was, a
5 municipal corporation located in Sacramento County, California, and created under the laws of the
6 State of California.

10: Respondent City Council of the City of Sacramento ("City Council") is, and at all

8 times herein mentioned was, the duly-elected legislative body of the City of Sacramento.

11: Citizens is ignorant of the true names and capacities of respondents and defendants
--10 sued herein-as DOES 1 through 100, inclusive, and, therefore,-sues said respondents and
11 defendants by such fictitious names. Citizens will amend this petition to allege their true names
12 and capacities when ascertained. Citizens is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that each

13 of the fictitiously named respondents and defendants is responsible in some manner for the acts

14 alleged hercin and/or will be directly impacted by the relief sought by Citizens in this matter.-

5 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

16 12. This Court has jurisdiction to review actions of the Respondents under California
.17 Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5, and to issue a peremptory writ of mandate
18 under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5.

19 13. Venue is proper in this Court under Code of Civil Procedure section 394(a) because
20 Respondents are located within the County of Sacramento.

21 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

22 A, The City Proposes The Project And Releases The Draft EIR

23 14. Sacramento is one of the few cities which continue to rely on a combined sewer
24 system that carries both sanitary waste and stormwater (the "SAC CSS"). The Project consists of
25 a proposed addition to the SAC CSS, which serves major portions of the City, including McKinley
26 Park. Currently, during storm events, when the SAC CSS exceeds capacity, mixed stormwater
27 and sanitary waste (i.e., sewage) flows out of the system through manholes onto nearby low-lying
28 arcas including streets and adjacent properties. The Project involves the construction of a large

4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 underground concrete vault in McKinley Park into which wastewater and stormwater will flow

2 and be stored during storm events.

3 15. On April 20, 2018, the City released the Project's Draft Environmental Impact

4 Report ("DEIR") for public comment, triggering a 45-day public comment period that would end

5 on June 6, 2018.

6 B. Citizens Objects To The Project

16. On June 6, 2018, Citizens submitted a letter commenting on the DEIR and

8 objecting to the Project. Citizens identified multiple. deficiencies in the DEIR, including the

9 DEIR's failure to adequately analyze and to propose mitigation measures to address the Project's

10 impacts-on-(i) -aesthetics and -visual resources; (ii) air quality; (iii) biological resources; (iv)
11 cultural resources; (v) geology and soils; (vi) hazards and hazardous materials; (vii) hydrology;
12| (viii) noise and vibration; and (iv) transportation and traffic. In addition, Citizens advised the City

13 that the DEIR's project description was legally deficient, and that the DEIR failed to adequately

4 describe and consider feasible project alternatives.

5 • P1 The City Releases The Final EIR
SAMFP*R

16 17. On September 28, 2018, the City announced that it had completed the Final
17. Environmental Impact Report for the Project ("FEIR"), in which it purported to respond to and

18 address the comments it had received from the public and responsible agencies. The City
19 scheduled a vote on the Project to be held at a meeting of the City Council on October 9, 2018.

20 D. Citizens Comments On The Final EIR

21 18. On October 9, 2018, prior to the City Council vote, Citizens submitted written
22 comments on the Project's FEIR, and reiterated its objections to the Project. In that letter,

23 Citizens advised the City that it failed to cure any of the defects in the DEIR described by

24 Citizens in its June 6, 2018 letter, namely: (i) it failed to adequately analyze and to propose
25 mitigation measures to address the Project's impacts on aesthetics and visual resources, air
26 quality, biological resources, cultural resources, geology and soils, hazards and hazardous
27 materials, hydrology, noise and vibration, and transportation and traffic; (ii) its project description
28 was legally deficient; (iii) it failed to discuss adequate and feasible alternatives to the Project; and

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 (iv) it failed to respond to Citizens' substantive comments on the DEIR. In addition, Citizens

2 advised the City that the FEIR improperly made significant changes to the DEIR without

3 analyzing the impacts of those changes, and without then recirculating the EIR for public review

4 and comment.

5 E. The City Council Votes To Approve The Project

6 19. On October 9, 2018, over Citizens' objection, the City Council voted to approve
the Project.

8 20. On October 10, 2018, the City filed a Notice of Determination advising that the
City Council had approved the Project on October 9, 2018.

10 21. This petition followed.

11 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

12 (Violation of CEQA: Deficient EIR)

13 [As Against All Respondents]

14 22. Citizens® incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth

15 herein.
*:

16 23, CEQA requires a public agency to prepare an EIR or cause an EIR to be prepared

17 for any project that it proposes to carry out or approve that may have a significant effect on the
18 environment. Cal. Pub. Res. Code, §§ 21100(a), 21151(a); 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15064 (a)(1).
19 The EIR must describe the proposed project and its environmental setting, state the objectives
20 sought to be achieved, identify and analyze the significant effects on the environment, state how

21 those impacts can be mitigated or avoided, and identify alternatives to the project, among other
22 requirements. Cal. Pub. Res. Code, §§ 21100(b), 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15124, 15125.

23 24. A* complete and accurate EIR is the cornerstone of CEQA. Its purpose is "to
24 | provide public agencies and the public in general with detailed information about the effect which
25 a proposed project is likely to have on the environment; to list the ways in which the significant
26 effects of such a project might be minimized; and to indicate alternatives to such a project." Cal.
27 Pub. Res. Code § 21061. As stated by the California Supreme Court, "[t]he purpose of an EIR is
28 to give the public and government agencies the information needed to make informed decisions,

6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

thus protecting 'not only the environment but also informed self-government." In re Bay-Delta
2 Etc. (2008) 43 Cal.4th 1143, 1162 (internal citation omitted). Stated otherwise, the EIR "is the
heart of CEQA, and the mitigation and alternatives discussion forms the core of an EIR.» Id.

25, The City was required to notify the public of the draft EIR, make the draft EIR and
all documents referenced in it available for public review, and respond to comments that raise

6 significant environmental issues. Cal. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21091(a), (d); 14 Cal. Code Regs, §§
15087, 15088. The City was then required to prepare a final EIR, including any revisions to the
8 draft EIR, considering any comments received from the public and other agencies. 14 Cal. Code
Regs. §§ 15089(a), 15132.

10 26.. The City was not permitted to approve revisions to the Project that will have
11 significant environmental effects if there are feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures
12 that would substantially lessen those effects. Cal. Pub. Res, Code §§ 21002, 21002.1(b); 14 Cal.

13 Code Regs. § 15021. Specifically, the City cannot approve a project that will have significant

C [4 environmental effects unless it finds, as to each significant effect, based on substantial evidence in

03 5 the administrative record, that: (1) mitigation measures required in or incorporated into the project
16 will avoid or substantially lessen the significant effect; (2) those measures are within the
17. jurisdiction of another public agency and have been adopted, or can and should be adopted, by that
18 agency; or (3) specific economic, legal, social, technological, or other considerations make the

19 mitigation measures 0r alternatives identified in the EIR infeasible, and specific overriding
20 economic, legal, social, technological, or other benefits outweigh the significant environmental

21 effects. Cal. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21081, 21081.5; [4 Cal. Code Regs. §§ 15091(a), (b).

22 A. The EIR Fails To Adequately Analyze And To Mitigate Project Impacts

23 27. The Project EIR fails to comply with CEQA because it did not adequately analyze

24 the Project's impacts and propose mitigation measures to reduce those impacts on (i) aesthetics

25 and visual resources; (ii) air quality; (iii) biological resources; (iv) cultural resources; (v) geology
26 and soils; (vi) hazards and hazardous materials; (vii) hydrology; (viii) noise and vibration; and (ix)
27 transportation and traffic. The EIR's deficiencies in each of these areas are summarized below.

28 ///

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 a. Aesthetics and Visual Resources: The EIR's discussion of impacts to visual
2 resources is inappropriately limited to impacts resulting from construction in McKinley Park's

3 baseball field. By disregarding impacts that would occur in the entire Project area, including off-

4 site work locations, the EIR underestimates the Project's impacts on aesthetics and visual

5 resources. Moreover, the EIR fails to accurately identify the number and types of trees that would

6 be removed or damaged by Project construction, and the resulting impacts on the historic scenic

7 vista that is historic McKinley Park. Although the FEIR states that 60 new trees will be planted in
8 the park, the EIR contains no mitigation measure that requires the planting of such trees.
9 Accordingly, the EIR cannot rely on the City's purported plan to plant new trees (of unidentified

10 species and size, and in an unidentified location) in.McKinley Park as a mitigation measure to

11 reduce the Project's impacts on trees to level of insignificance.

12 b. Air Quality: The DEIR's air quality analysis suffered from numerous deficiencies.
13 Among other things, the analysis (i) was performed using an outdated version of the CalBEMOD

14 program; (ii) provided insufficient details about values that were used in the modeling; (iii) made
15 certain land use assumptions that were not supported by the DEIR; (iv) underestimated the total
16| number of haul trips that would be required to complete the Project; (v) failed to account for
17| emissions that would be caused by importing materials to the Project site; and (vi) underestimated
18 and miscalculated Project trips, thereby underestimating emissions.

19 Although the City attempted to reanalyze air quality impacts in the FEIR, it did so
20 incorrectly and failed to correct the deficiencies in the DEIR, Moreover, although the FEIR
21 identifies the Project impact area as being located even closer to the Tiny Tots Daycare, the FEIR
22 provides no analysis of the Localized Significance Thresholds for this substantial change, and
23 makes no effort to mitigate impacts to children at the daycare center.

24 C. Biological Resources: The EIR's analysis of the Project's impacts on biological
25  resources is fatally flawed insofar as it relies on a false assumption that the Project would require
26 only minimal tree trimming. That assumption is not supported by substantial evidence. To the
27 contrary, the DEIR failed to disclose that 39 trees were in direct conflict with Project construction
28 activities and would need to be removed, while an additional 26 trees would be severely impacted

8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

by the Project and would require either removal or severe pruning. The EIR does not identify,
2 study, or mitigate these impacts to level of insignificance. To the extent that the EIR attempts to

3 defer mitigation of the Project's impacts to trees by noting that tree removal permits will be

4 obtained in accordance with the City's tree ordinance, the EIR fails to comply with CEQA.

O Indeed, compliance with such an ordinance would do nothing to prevent or to mitigate
6 environmental impacts resulting from the removal and/or severe damage that the Project would
7 cause to the trees in McKinley Park.

8 Moreover, although the FEIR states that no more than six trees will be removed as part of
the Project, the FEIR does not study whether the Project will damage or potentially kill additional
10 | trees. To the contrary, the EIR incorrectly assumes that placing fencing on the edge of the tree
11 dripline would be sufficient to protect the trees, but fails to address the Project's impacts on the
12 root systems of these trees. The EIR's assumption that tree roots would not grow beyond the
13 dripline is unsupported and constitutes a significant defect a in the EIR's analysis of impacts on
3
14 trees.

15 d. Cultural Resourees: The EIR fails to adequately analyze and to mitigate the
16 Project's impacts on cultural resources. McKinley Park's nomination to the National Register of
17 Historic Places was presented to the City's Historic Preservation Commission on March 21, 2018,
18 prior to the release of the DEIR. After public comment, discussion, and due consideration, the
19 Commission directed City staff to inform the California Office of Historic Preservation of the
20 City's support for the nomination. The DEIR was released for public comment approximately one

21 month later, on April 20, 2018. Nevertheless, the DEIR appended a "Technical Memorandum"
22 that concludes that McKinley Park lacks historic significance, is ineligible for historic registers,
23 and should not be considered an historic resource for purposes of CEQA. These conclusions are
2,4 contrary to the National Register nomination and the Preservation Commission's recommendation

25 on March 21, 2018, and are not supported by substantial evidence. Moreover, as of October 18,
26 2018, McKinley Park is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The EIR failed to

27 consider the Project's impacts on this historic resource.

28 111

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 Similarly unsupported by substantial evidence was the EIR's conclusion that "the proposed
2 Project would not cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of McKinley Park since

3 the park would maintain its existing use once construction is finished and the historical context

4 would be maintained.» Indeed, the EIR fails to adequately analyze environmental impacts that
5 may be caused by leakage and overflow following the Project's construction, and the resulting
6 odor, pathogen, and health threats that would degrade the community's use and enjoyment of the

7 park, thereby substantially impairing McKinley Park's existing uses. In addition, the EIR fails to
00 apply the Secretary of the Interior's criteria for historic resources to its analysis of the Project's
9 | impacts. For example, the EIR incorrectly concludes that the loss of the baseball field in
10 McKinley Park is not significant because it will be replaced with soccer fields and other open

11 areas. The EIR's conclusion is inconsistent with the Secretary of the Interior's standards in that it
12 fails to consider that baseball has been played in McKinley Park since its inception, and at this
13 specific location within the park since 1927.

14 e. Geology and Soils: Although the DEIR stated that a site-specific geotechnical
15 analysis would be conducted prior to construction, deferring the preparation of such a report was
:
16 improper in light of the fact that the Project would involve constructing a large, reinforced
17 structure underground, in an area with high groundwater and subject to liquefaction. Without a
18 meaningful geotechnical analysis, the DEIR did not and could not have adequately identified,
19 studied, or mitigated geotechnical hazards, including those relating to liquefaction, landslides, and

20 unstable or expansive soils. Although the FEIR added a geotechnical report that was completed
21| after the comment period for the DEIR closed, that report contains no information on geotechnical
22 issues, including seismic hazards, earthquakes, or liquefaction. Nor did the EIR adequately study
23  impacts that may be caused by system failures, including leakage and overflow.

24 f. Hazards and Hazardous Matcrials: The Project will cause millions of gallons of

25 contaminated water and sewage to be imported from the surrounding region into McKinley Park,
26 where it will be stored underground for an unidentified period of time. The EIR fails to

27 adequately evaluate the short-term and long-term risks of diverting and storing this contaminated
28 water and sewage material under McKinley Park. Indeed, the EIR fails to study environmental

10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

impacts that inevitably will be caused by leakage from pipes and the Sewage Vault, and by
2 ovorflow, flooding, and surface ponding during and after storm events. Nor does the EIR address
3 the fact that these impacts are more likely to occur--and to be more severe-as a result of climate

4 change, which the State of California forecasts will result in larger and more frequent storms,

5 more flooding, and increased risks to wastewater infrastructure. With the impending increase in
6 the frequency and severity of storm events, the Sewage Vault and its diversion system will be used
more frequently, and at a higher intensity, leading to increased risks of system failure.
Nevertheless, the EIR fails to disclose or to analyze potential, foresecable hazards associated with
leaks of untreated sewage from the Sewage Vault system into the area's groundwater. Nor does
10 the EIR. consider potential impacts of such leaks of hazardous materials (or of hazardous materials

11 that will be used during construction) on the Tiny Tots Daycare facility, which is located
12 immediately south of the Project site.

13 g Hydrology: The EIR's description of existing conditions fails to include a
14 discussion of groundwater quality. This information is critical in light of the Project's potential to
15 impact groundwater due to vault and pipe leakage. Nevertheless, the EIR fails to identify the
16 current quality of the area's groundwater, or to study impacts that may result from system failure
17 and leakage from the Sewage Vault into the groundwater table, which is high and near the surface

18 in this area. The EIR fails to explain or to analyze the large increase in capacity proposed for the
19 Project, why that increase has occurred, and how it will impact the East Sacramento
20 neighborhood. Nor does the BIR explain how long water containing human waste and other

21 contaminants will need to be stored in the Sewage Vault before it can be pumped to a treatment

22 facility, or how stored waters and other materials will be treated or disposed of following
23 completion of the Project.

24 h. Noise and Vibration: The EIR contains no meaningful noise impact analysis,
25 notwithstanding that the Project will require a large number of heavy trucks, as well as pile drivers
26  and dewatering pumps that will be present on the site for a two-year period. Nor does the EIR
27 consider the significance of noise impacts in light of McKinley Park's location, which is adjacent
28| to a variety of sensitive receptors, including elderly residents, park users, and children at the Tiny

11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 Tots Daycare. The EIR also fails adequately to study the impact of vibration on structures within

2 McKinley Park, including historic structures that were built well before modern building code

3 requirements, as well as impacts to older structures surrounding the park. In fact, although the

4 EIR acknowledges that vibration damage could be caused to "extremely fragile historic
5 buildings…fragile buildings, and historic and some old buildings" at the levels described in the

6 EIR, the EIR fails to provide reasonable mitigation measures to address those impacts.
Transportation and Traffic: The EIR understates the Project's impacts on traffic

8 by, among other things, miscalculating the number of heavy truck trips, which will be at least

9 twice as high as reported, and failing to weight heavy truck trips, which are commonly doubled to
10 account for impacts resulting from the size and slow speeds of such trucks. Moreover, the EIR

.1 fails to consider how Project construction at off-site improvement areas will impact traffic
12 conditions, or to analyze the hazards and traffic impacts that will result from queuing of vehicles

13 on already congested City streets during construction. Nor does the EIR provide meaningful
4 mitigation measures to address the Project's traffic impacts, notwithstanding that at least 100
5 trucks per day will drive through the Project site. In addition, the FEIR substantially changes the
16 way in which the Project site will be accessed, and proposes a single ingress and egress on 33rd
7 Strect. This change will likely cause multiple significant impacts that have not been analyzed,
18 including impacts relating to traffic and emergency vehicle access.

19 B. The EIR's Project Description Is Legally Deficient

20 .28. In addition to the above-cited defects, the EIR also fails to comply with CEQA
21 because its Project Description is legally deficient. For example, the EIR's Project Description is
22 misleading insofar as it fails to disclose that the Project will not cure the flooding issues facing the
23 City. In fact, it appears that the EIR improperly attempts to minimize even the current flooding

24 conditions in the McKinley Park area.

25 29, Moreover, the EIR improperly omits certain critical Project details, and provides
26 conflicting information about others. For example, the DEIR does not identify the depth of the

27 Sewage Vault or associated excavation. Such information is critical to any analysis of the
28 Project's impacts on air quality, biological resources, cultural resources, and geology. Nor does

12 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

the EIR state how long overflows would be retained in the Sewage Vault, or provide information
2 concerning the nature and levels of contaminants that are likely to be present in the Sewage Vault.
In addition, the DEIR repeatedly described the size of the Sewage Vault structure as 300 feet by

4 350 feet. However, figures in the DEIR depicted a Project area of just 255 feet by 300 feet,
significantly underestimating the area of impact. This inconsistency may have caused the public

6 and responsible agencies to believe, incorrectly, that the Project's impact area will be confined
entirely to the baseball field, and to underestimate the significance of the Project's impacts on the
8 environment. In addition, the FEIR's description of the Project is significantly different than the
description in the DEIR. -Specifically, the FEIR reduces the size of the Sewage Vault itself, but
10 substantially increases the size of the Project work area. In summary, the EIR fails to set forth an
11 "accurate, stable and finite project description" that would allow the public and responsible
12 agencies to conduct a meaningful evaluation of the Project and its impacts.

3 The EIR Fails To Describe And To Consider Feasible Project Alternatives
4 30,: The EIR's alternatives analysis fails to satisfy CEQA's requirements. CEQA
5 provides that an EIR must describe "a range of reasonable alternatives to the project, or to the
16 location of the project, which would feasibly obtain most of the basic objectives of the project but
17: would avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the project," and must
18 "evaluate the comparative merits of the alternatives." 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15126.6(a). This
19 discussion must "focus on alternatives to the project or its location which are capable of avoiding
20 or substantially lessening any significant effects of the project, even if these alternatives would
21 | impede to some degree the attainment of the project objectives, or would be more costly." 14
22 Cal. Code Regs. § 15126.6(b).

23 31. The EIR fails to identify any alternative proposal that is reasonable, feasible, and
24 that would reduce the impacts of the proposed Project. Instead, the EIR includes a brief
25 discussion of so-called alternatives that it dismisses for reasons such as "limited room" at the
26 alternative site, and "significantly less impact on flooding reduction." Such "alternatives" are
27  neither reasonable nor feasible. Rather, the City was required to describe alternatives to the

28 Project that would "feasibly obtain most of the basic objectives of the project," and to compare the

13
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

merits of the Project against those of the proposed alternatives. The City failed to do so.
2 Moreover, the historic nature of McKinley Park, and its nomination to the National Register,

3 makes the park unique site when compared to alternative locations. The EIR did not properly
4 account for this unique feature of the McKinley Park site when considering Project alternatives.

D. The City Failed To Adequately Respond To Comments On The DEIR

6 32. CEQA requires that a lead agency respond to all substantive comments received on
draft-environmental impact report. Specifically, section 15088(a) of the CEQA Guidelines
8 provides that a "lead agency shall evaluate comments on environmental issues received from
persons whö reviewed the draft EIR and shall prepare a written response." In addition, section

10 15088(c) of the CEQA Guidelines states as follows:

11 The written: response shall describe the disposition of significant environmental

12 issucs raised (e.g., revisions to the proposed project to mitigate anticipated impacts or objections). In particular, the major environmental issues raised when

13 the lead agency's position is at variance with recommendations and objections raised in the comments must be addressed in detail giving reasons why specific

4 comments and suggestions were not accepted. There must be good faith, reasoned ranalysis in response. Conclusory statements unsupported by factual information will not suffice.
15

16 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15008(c).

33.
17 The City failed to comply with CEQA because it failed to provide sufficient

18 responses to Citizens' comments on the EIR.

-34.
19 For example, the City failed to address Citizens' comments and questions regarding

20 (i) inconsistencies in the DEIR between the large design capacity of the Sewage Vault as

21 compared to the storm water generated in outflows in the East Sacramento CSS; (ii) the EIR's

22 failure to address. the length of time that overflows would be retained in the Sewage Vault,

23 particularly during periods of protracted rainfall; (iii) the EIR's failure to describe the methóds and

24 techniques that would be used to shore up the walls of the Sewage Vault; (iv) the EIR's failure to

25 describe or to quantify additional flows that would need to be accommodated due to the addition

26 of interceptors and diversion structures that would allow flows from other CSS lines in H Street

27 and McKinley Boulevard to access the Sewage Vault; (v) the EIR's failure to quantify discharge

28 from dewatering pumps and to mitigate the impacts of such discharge; (vi) the lack of information

14
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 in the EIR regarding the nature and levels of contaminants that will potentially be present in the
2 Sewage Vault (and therefore in runoff), such as human waste/E. coli, petroleum distillates, heavy

3 metals, asbestos, etc.; (vii) the EIR's failure to analyze the Project's impacts on the root systems of

4 trees in the Project area; (viii) the insufficiency of the Project's alternatives analysis; (ix) the
5 defects in the EIR's analysis of noise and vibration; and (x) the EIR's miscalculation of vehicle
6 trips.

35.- For all of the foregoing reasons, the City abused its discretion and failed to proceed
8 in the manner required by law when it approved the Project.

0 36.: -- The -Project will -irreparably harm Citizens -and the •citizens of the -City of
10 Sacramento by, inter alia, causing substantial environmental _impacts without considering the

11 significance of such impacts and considering and imposing appropriate mitigation measures, and
12 without giving the public and responsible agencies a meaningful opportunity to a comment on those

13 impacts.

14 37 Citizens performed all of the conditions precedent to filing this action by sending

5 written letters to Respondents objecting to the proposed activity during the comment period and
t.
16 prior to the close of the public hearing on the City Council's approyal of the Project. Citizens is

17 beneficially interested in the activity described herein. Accordingly, Citizens has exhausted its
18 administrative remedies and has standing to bring this action.

19 38. There is no appeal available from Respondents' determinations challenged herein.
20 Citizens has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy available, other than the relief sought in this
21 Verified Petition.

22 39. The issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate pursuant to the provisions of Public
23|| Resources Code sections 21167, 21168, and 21168.5, and Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1085
24 and 1094.5 is just and proper under the circumstances pled in this Verified Petition.

25 40. By this action, Citizens seeks to enforce an important right affecting the public
26 interest in order to confer a significant benefit on the public as a whole by protecting the
27 environment of the City of Sacramento and enforcing the provisions of CEQA,

41. Citizens is incurring substantial expenses in attorneys' fees and costs in pursuing
2 this matter, all of which are within the jurisdictional limit of this Court. There is no monetary
3 recovery sought or allowed in this action that would be available to offset the expense of pursuing

4 this action for Citizens. The necessity and financial burden of private enforcement is such as to
5 make an award of attorneys' fees in favor of Citizens appropriate.

6 42. Citizens is entitled to recover an award of attorneys' fees from Respondents under
7 the provisions of California Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.

8 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

(Violation of CEQA: Failure To Recirculate EIR)

10 [As Against All Respondents]

11 43, Citizens incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth
12  herein.

13 44. CEQA requires recirculation of an EIR when "significant new information is added
14 to the EIR after public notice is given of the availability of the draft EIR for public review under
15: Section 15087 but before certification.' 14 Cal. Code Regs. § :15088.5. "Significant new
16 information" requiring recirculation of an EIR includes, for example, a disclosure showing that
17 "[a] new significant environmental impact would result from the project," or that "[a] substantial
18 increase in the severity of an environmental impact would result unless mitigation measures are

19 adopted that reduce the impact to a level of insignificance." Id. This recirculation requirement is
20 a fundamental principle of CEQA, and failure to comply invalidates any resulting approval.

21 45. Following the close of the public comment period on the DEIR for the Project, the
22 City added significant new information to the FEIR. For example, the FEIR discloses that the size

23 of the Project's impact area will be significantly greater than the impact area identified in the
24 DEIR. However, the FEIR fails to analyze impacts resulting from the expansion of the Project's
25 impact area, including those relating to air quality, trees, the historic resource that is McKinley

26 Park, and noise and vibration, particularly as they concern children attending the Tiny Tots
27 Daycare.
28 ///

16
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

46. Similarly, the FEIR substantially changes the way in which the Project site will be
2 accessed, and now proposes a single ingress and a egress on 33rd Street. This change will likely

3 cause multiple significant impacts that have not been analyzed, including impacts relating to
traffic and emergency vehicle access. The EIR must be revised to study the impacts of these

5 significant changes, and must then be recirculated for public review and comment.

6 47. In addition, the FEIR adds significant new information about the Project's impacts
0n cultural resources. This information was not provided to the public and responsible agencies

8 for review and comment.

C 48.- • The foregoing changes made to the EIR after the DEIR was circulated for review

10 and comment constituted significant new information that required the City to recirculate the EIR.

11 49. The City's failure to recirculate the EIR constitutes a violation of CEQA and
12 invalidates the approval of the Project.

13 50. The Project will thereby irreparably harm Citizens and the citizens of the City of
14. Sacramento by, inter alia, causing substantial environmental impacts without considering the

. w 15 significance of such impacts and considering and imposing appropriate mitigation measures, and

16 without giving the public and responsible agencies a meaningful opportunity to comment on those
17 impacts.

18 51. Citizens performed all of the conditions precedent to filing this action by sending
19 written letters to Respondents objecting to the proposed activity during the comment period and
20 prior to the close of the public hearing on the City Council's approval of the Project. Citizens is
21 beneficially interested in the activity described herein. Accordingly, Citizens has exhausted its
22 administrative remedies and has standing to bring this action under State and local planning law.

23 52. There is no appeal available from Respondents' determinations challenged herein.
24| Citizens has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy available, other than the relief sought in this
25 Verified Petition.

26 53. The issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate pursuant to the provisions of Public
27 Resources Code sections 21167, 21168, and 21168.5, and Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085
28 and 1094.5 is just and proper under the circumstances pled in this Verified Petition.

12 (Violation of CEQA: Failure to Notify And Consult With Responsible Agencies)
[As Against All Respondents]
4 57; Citizens incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully set

•5 forth herein.

16 58. Citizens is informed and believes and thereon alleges that Respondents violated
17 CEQA by failing to notify and consult with responsible agencies prior to completing and
18 certifying the Project EIR.

19 59. Public Resources Code section 21153 provides that "[p]rior to completing an
20 environmental impact report, every local lead agency shall consult with, and obtain comments

21 from, each responsible agency, trustee agency, any public agency that has jurisdiction by law with
22  respect to the project..." Cal. Pub. Res. Code § 21153(a); see also 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15086. §

23 60. Citizens is informed and believes and thereon alleges that the California State
24 Water Resources Control Board (the "Water Board") is a responsible agency as defined by section
25 21069 of the Public Resources Code.

26 61.: Citizens is informed and believes and thereon alleges that Respondents violated

27 CEQA by failing to notify the Water Board of the Project, to provide a copy of the EIR to the

28 Water Board, and to consult with the Water Board prior to certification of the BIR.
