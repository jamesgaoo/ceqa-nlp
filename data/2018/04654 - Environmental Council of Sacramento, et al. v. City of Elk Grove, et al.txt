GROVE and CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF ELK GROVE'S June 27, 2018 adoption of an m
v1 wo Addendum to the certified Environmental Impact Report (*EIR") for the Southeast Policy Area
("SEPA") Strategic Plan involving text changes to the EIR and previously adopted Mitigation
Monitoring and Reporting Program ("MMRP").

7 2. Petitioners seek a determination from this Court that Respondents' approval of the

8 Addendum modifying Mitigation Measure ("MM") 5.4.7d and the MMRP is invalid and void as

9 it fails to satisfy the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public

10 Resources Code, section 21000 et seq., and the CEQA Guidelines, Title 14, California Code of

11 Regulations, section 15000 et seq.

PARTIES 12

13 3. Petitioner Environmental Council of Sacramento ("ECOS") is a California
14 nonprofit public benefit corporation working to protect and improve the environmental quality of

15 the Greater Sacramento Metropolitan Region and its adjoining ecosystems. Its members include
16 other environmental organizations, neighborhood groups, and individuals. ECOS has expressed

17 particular concern for the environment in which its members live, including Sacramento County.

18 The environment and residents of Sacramento County will be directly affected by

19 the impacts of the Project. ECOS members live, work, travel, and enjoy recreational activities

20 in Sacramento County. These members have a particular interest in the protection of the

21 environment of Sacramento County, and are increasingly concerned about worsening

22 environmental and land use conditions that detrimentally affect their well-being and that of

23 other residents and visitors of Sacramento County. ECOS and its members have a direct and

24 substantial beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondents comply with laws relating to

25 environmental protection. ECOS and its members are adversely affected by Respondents'

26 failure to comply with CEQA in approving the Addendum and MM 5.4.7d and the MMRP.
27 5. Petitioner Sierra Club is California nonprofit membership organization

2 28 incorporated under the laws of the State of California in 1892. Currently, the Sierra Club has
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

0 NOUAWN approximately 500,000 members, approximately one-third of whom live in California.
Approximately 18,000 members belong to the Sierra Club's Mother Lode Chapter that includes
Sacramento County. The Sierra Club functions to educate and enlist people to protect and
restore the natural and human environment, to practice and promote responsible use of the
earth's ecosystems and resources, to explore, enjoy, and protect wild places, and to use all lawful
means to achieve these objectives.

6. The Sierra Club has expressed particular concern for the environment in which its

9 members live, including Sacramento County. Chapter members live, work, travel and enjoy

10 recreational activities in Sacramento County. These members have a particular interest in the

11 protection of the Sacramento County environment and are increasingly concerned about

12 worsening environmental and land use conditions that detrimentally affect their well-being and

13 that of other residents and visitors to Sacramento County. Sierra Club and its members have a

14 direct and substantial beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondents comply with laws relating

15 to environmental protection. Sierra Club and its members are adversely affected by

16 Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA in approving the Addendum and MM 5.4.7d and the

MMRP.

17 7.

18 Petitioner Friends of the Swainson's Hawk was formed in 1994 when se veral

19 Sacramento bird watchers realized that this species, listed as threatened under the California

20 Endangered Species Act would likely get paved out of the region if citizens did not advocate to

21 protect the bird's habitat. The Friends of the Swainson's Hawk work to ensure the State,

22 counties, and cities implement legal protections for the Swainson's Hawk. Further, Friends of

23 the Swainson's Hawk educates the public about the importance of the species to the Sacramento

24 and Central Valley areas and what needs to be done to protect the Swainson's Hawk habitat.

25 Friends of the Swainson's Hawk has an interest in permanent preservation of agricultural lands

26 in Sacramento County and elsewhere in the region because Swainson's Hawks use agricultural

27 lands intensively and reliance on mitigation lands alone to protect Swainson's Hawk would not
ensure the continued survival of the species in this region.

STATEMENT OF FACTS CO THE PROJECT

16. The revisions to the Project consists of changes to the certified EIR and adopted
20 MMRP for the SEPA Strategic Plan. The changes modify MM 5.4.7d related to mitigating for

21 the loss of Swainson's hawk ("SWH") foraging habitat, adding an option for projects subject to

22 the SEPA EIR, including the Souza Dairy Project (EG-13-030), to mitigate for SWH foraging

23 habitat at the 4,768-acre Van Vleck Ranch in Sacramento County.

24 B. BACKGROUND INFORMATION

25 17. On or about July 9, 2014, the City of Elk Grove certified the Final Environmental

26 Impact Report for the Southeast Planning Area (SEPA) Strategic Plan (State Clearinghouse NO.

27 2013042054) and approved the SEPA Strategic Plan. The SEPA Strategic Plan allows for

28 future urban development on 1,090 acres of vacant land in the City of Elk Grove.
5 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

L 18.

auAWN The EIR found that the site contained suitable SWH foraging habitat. There are

ten SWH nests within one mile of the SEPA, and numerous other SWH nests south, east, and
west of the project site. Nesting SWH forage for small rodents on local agricultural fields.
19. In approving the SEPA Strategic Plan, the City adopted MM 5.4.7(d) and MMRP,
which provides that the loss of SWH foraging habitat would be mitigated at the ratio of one acre

7 of SWH foraging habitat preserved off-site, by fee title or conservation easement, for each acre

8 lost, consistent with the Elk Grove Swainson's Hawk Mitigation Ordinance (Elk Grove

9 Municipal Code, § 16.130 et seq,).

20.

10 The Ordinance requires approval of the mitigation land and its location by the

11 California Department of Fish and Wildlife ("CDFW"). The Ordinance provides the City
Council discretion

12 to approve unspecified alternative mitigation measures without CDFW

13 consultation or approval, and to override mitigation for reasons consistent with CEQA. (Elk

14 Grove Municipal Code, §16.130.110.)
21.

15 On August 12, 2015, the City Council approved the tentative subdivision map and

16 development agreement for the 375-acre Souza Dairy Project, developer Kamilos Holdings I,

17 subject to the conditions of the SEPA Strategic Plan and certified EIR, including the SWH

18 mitigation requirement in MM 5.4.7d and MMRP.

22.

19 On December 8, 2017, the City submitted to CDFW a proposal to establish an 895-

20 acre SWH mitigation site with a conservation easement on the Van Vleck Ranch 18 miles east

21 of the City of Elk Grove, to provide SWH mitigation for future development in the SEPA

22 (including the Souza Dairy Project). The 4,768-acre Van Vleck Ranch is mostly dry pasture

23 grassland in the transition zone between the central valley and the Sierra foothills, east and

24 south of Rancho Murietta. This would replace the requirements in MM 5.4.7d requiring SWH

25 mitigation within ten miles of the SEPA.

23.

26 CDFW has long determined that the maximum biologically supportable distance

27 between the point of impact and SWH mitigation habitat is ten miles, and that the foraging

28 quality of mitigation habitat should equal or exceed the quality of SWH foraging habitat lost.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 24.

2 A map of SWH nests shows very few SWH nests in that area, as contrasted with
the high density of SWH nests within 10 miles of Elk Grove. There is only one documented

0u A SWH nest on the 4,768 acre Van Vleck Ranch. The density of SWH nests is indicative of the
suitability of an area for SWH foraging.

25. The City relies upon two reports by Estep Consulting, paid for by Kamilos
Holdings I, LLC and Van Vleck Ranch. The Estep reports and Van Vleck Ranch proposed

8 speculative measures that they assert would improve SWH habitat on the Van Vleck Ranch in

9 the future, consisting of 50 acres planted in alfalfa, planting 20 cottonwood trees, and

10 management of dry grassland in a way that they assert will improve SWH foraging value on the

Van Vleck Ranch.

11 26.

12 In response the City's proposal, on January 12, 2018 CDFW issued a consultation

13 letter to the City. CDFW rejected the City's proposal for modifying MM 5.4.7d and the

14 MMRP. CDFW based this rejection on the following grounds: 1) the Van Vleck Ranch is not

15 within a biologically supportable distance (10 miles) from the SEPA; 2) the foraging habitat on

16 the Van Vleck Ranch is of lesser quality and cannot support the larger population density

17 present near the SEPA; 3) the modification conflicts with the SWH conservation strategy under

18 the proposed South Sacramento County Habitat Conservation Plan; and 4) the modifications

19 conflict with the nearby Westervelt Mitigation Bank, which was authorized by CDFW to sell

20 SWH credits for development projects located within its service area, which is limited to an

21 area east of Sunrise Boulevard on grassland similar to the proposed Van Vleck site, but not the

22 Elk Grove area, where SWH foraging habitat is much higher value (e.g.: more small rodents for
SWH to eat) due to irrigated agriculture.

23 C. THE CITY'S APPROVAL OF THE ADDENDUM TO THE EIR FOR THE SEPA

24 27.

25 On or about March 5, 2018, Souza Elk Grove, LLC submitted an application to the

26 Development Services of the City of Elk Grove to revise the MM 5.4.7d and the MMRP

27 approved when the City certified EIR for the SEPA Strategic Plan and approved the SEPA
Strategic Plan.

28
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

co -N0 7OOP 28. On June 22,2018 and June 24, 2018, Petitioners submitted letters to the City
opposing the adoption of the Addendum on the grounds that it would violate CEQA's
requirements regarding the preparation of a subsequent environmental impact report.

29. On June 27,2018, the City held a public hearing regarding the Addendum and
proposed modifications to MM 5.4.7d and the MMRP. Petitioners' representatives provided
comments at the June 27,2018 and objected the City's reliance on an Addendum.
30. At the June 27, 2018 meeting, the City Council approved "Resolution of the City

9 of Council of the City of Elk Grove Adopting an Addendum to the Southeast Policy Area

10 Strategic Plan Certified Environmental Impact Report and Previously Adopted Mitigation

11 Monitoring and Reporting Program (Project EG18-017.) The Resolution approved the
Addendum and the revisions to MM 5.4.7d and the MMRP.

12 31.

13 On June 29, 2018, the City filed a Notice of Determination with the Sacramento
County Clerk.

14 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

15 32.

16 This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to

17 Code of Civil Procedure section 10945, and Public Resources Code section 21168. In the

18 alternative, this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 and
Public Resources Code section 21168.5.

19 33.

20 Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 394(a), venue is proper in this Court
because the Project is located within the County of Sacramento.

21

22 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES
AND INADEQUACY OF REMEDY

23 34. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant

24 action and have exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required

25 by law.

26 35. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code, section

27 21167.5 by mailing written notice of this action to the Respondents. A copy of this written

28 notice and proof of service are attached as Exhibit A to this Petition for Writ of Mandate.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 8

36. Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.6 by
concurrently filing a request concerning preparation of the record of administrative proceedings
relating to this action.

37. Petitioners have no piain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require respondents to set aside their
approval of the Project and certification of the EIR. In the absence of such remedies, the
Respondents approval will remain in effect in violation of State law.
co 38. This action has been brought within 30 days of the filing of the Notice of

9 Determination.

10 STANDING

11 39. Petitioners have standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because

12 Petitioners' and their respective members' aesthetic and environmental interests are directly

13 and adversely affected by the Respondents' approval of the Project.

14 CAUSE OF ACTION
(Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act, 15 Public Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)
16 40. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference Paragraphs 1 through 39, inclusive,
17 of this Petition, as if fully set forth below.
18 41. Respondents committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in a
19 manner required by law by approving an Addendum that fails to meet the requirements of CEQA
20 for disclosure, analysis, and/or mitigation of significant project impacts.
21 42. Respondents' Findings of Fact violate the requirements of the CEQA Guidelines.
22 The Findings fail to identify the changes or alterations that are required to avoid or substantially
23 lessen the project's significant environmental effects (CEQA Guidelines § 15091(a)(1), and the
24 Findings are not supported by substantial evidence (CEQA Guidelines, § 15091(b)).
25 43. CEQA Guidelines section 15164(a) authorizes the preparation of an Addendum to
26 previously certified EIR if minor changes are necessary but none of the conditions of CEQA
27 Guidelines section 15162 (significant new or more severe environmental effects) are present.
28
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 9

-Nm tno The Addendum must contain an explanation as to why the change would not constitute : new or
more severe environmental impact, supported by substantial evidence. (CEQA Guidelines, §
15164(e). (See Ukiah Citizens for Safety First v. City of Ukiah (2016) 248 Cal.App.4t9 256,
265-66.)

44. CEQA Guidelines section 15162 requires the preparation of a subsequent EIR if
there are substantial changes that require major revisions in the certified EIR due to significant
new environmental effects or a substantial increase a in the severity of previously identified co significant effects.

9 45. On January 12, 2018, CDFW responded to Elk Grove's Request for 30-day

10 consultation regarding the SWH Mitigation Proposal, Kamilos Southeast Policy Area Project,

11 City of Elk Grove, California, Under CBQA, CDFW is the "trustee agency" for the SWH.
Estep's October 2016 "Habitat 12 46. CDFW's Consultation letter referred to Jim

13 Suitability Assessment" of the proposed Van Vleck Ranch mitigation site (relied upon by the

14. City), and discussed the habitat characteristics of the site, and concluded that:

15 (L) That part of the Van Vleck mitigation site closest to the SEPA area is 18

16 miles distant and is therefore not within a biologically supportable distance from the impact site,

17 which CDFW had previously determined should not exceed 10 miles from the impact site

18 (2) The Van Vleck Ranch mitigation site does not contain similar foraging

19 habitat to the impact site. The majority of the proposed Van Vleck Ranch mitigation site is
20 annual grassland with some oak woodland whereas the impact site consists of alfalfa and other

21 semi-perennial hays, hayfields, irrigated cropland, and irrigated pasture that provides higher

22 foraging habitat value that the Van Vleck Ranch mitigation site. The Van Vleck Ranch

23 mitigation site cannot support the larger population density that is present near the SEPA.
24 (3) The Van Vleck Ranch mitigation site is in direct competition with a

25 neighboring mitigation bank owned by Westervelt and may have an unfair advantage if impacts

26 for projects located outside of the CDFW-approved ten-mile service area of the Westervelt

27 mitigation bank were allowed to mitigate on the Van Vleck Ranch mitigation area.
28 47. Despite CDFW's refusal to accept the proposed change, the City approved the
10 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

H Addendum and the revisions to MM 5.4.7d and the MMRP.

Ne 48. For the reasons set forth by CDFW, the City's approval of the revisions will result
in a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant effects to SHW and
SHW foraging habitat as the Van Vleck Ranch mitigation site is 18 miles, at its closest point,
from the SEPA project impact, and it possesses considerably less habitat value than the SEPA
00 J 0 project site.

49. The City's failure to prepare a subsequent or supplement EIR violates CEQA's
requirements and constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion and is contrary to law.

9 PRAYER FOR RELIEE

11 1. That this Court issue a peremptory writ of mandate ordering Respondents to :
