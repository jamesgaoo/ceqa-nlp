25 TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA:
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, pursuant to Public Resources Code § 21167.7 and Code of Civil
26 Procedure § 388, that on July 26, 2018, TRUOJAI, LLC filed a Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate
27 against County of Ventura ("County") in the Ventura County Superior Court. The Petition alleges that
28 the County violated the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") by finding that its June 19,

NOTICE TO ATTORNEY GENERAL

2018 adoption of "County-Initiated Proposal to Amend Articles 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 14 and 18 of the Non-

2 Coastal Zoning Ordinance ("NCZO") (PL 17-0138) to Regulate Temporary Rental Units" ("TRU

3 Ordinance") is exempt from CEQA environmental review pursuant to the "common sense" exception
4 set forth in title 14, California Code of Regulations, §15061(b)(3) ("CEQA Guidelines"). The Petition

5 for Writ of Mandate also alleges that the TRU Ordinance was adopted by the County without fully
6 complying with California Planning and Zoning Law, is facially void because it violates principles of

7 federal and state constitutional equal protection and due process, violates vested property rights, and

8 constitutes a regulatory taking of the distinct investment-backed expectations of those it effects.
9 Petitioner seeks to set aside the County's adoption of the TRU Ordinance as well as obtain declaratory
10 and injunctive relief to stop the enforcement and effectiveness of the TRU Ordinance.
