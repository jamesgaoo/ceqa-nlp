INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO COMPLETE THE COVER SHEET CM-010
To Plaintiffs and Others Filing First Papers. If you are filing a first paper (for example, a complaint) in a civil case, you must complete and file, along with your first paper, the Civil Case Cover Sheet contained on page 1. This information will be used to compile statistics about the types and numbers of cases filed. You must complete items 1 through 6 on the sheet. In item 1, you must check one box for the case type that best describes the case. If the case fits both a general and a more specific type of case listed in item 1, check the more specific one. If the case has multiple causes of action, check the box that best indicates the primary cause of action. To assist you in completing the sheet, examples of the cases that belong under each case type in item 1 are provided below. A cover sheet must be filed only with your initial paper. Failure to file a cover sheet with the first paper filed in a civil case may subject a party, its counsel, or both to sanctions under rules 2.30 and 3.220 of the California Rules of Court. To Parties in Rule 3.740 Collections Cases. A "collections case" under rule 3.740 is defined as an action for recovery of money owed in a sum stated to be certain that is not more than $25,000, exclusive of interest and attorney's fees, arising from a transaction in which property, services, or money was acquired on credit. A collections case does not include an action seeking the following: (1) tort damages, (2) punitive damages, (3) recovery of real property, (4) recovery of personal property, or (5) a prejudgment writ of attachment. The identification of a case as a rule 3.740 collections case on this form means that it will be exempt from the general time-for-service requirements and case management rules, unless a defendant files a responsive pleading. A rule 3.740 collections case will be subject to the requirements for service and obtaining a judgment in rule 3.740. To Parties in Complex Cases. In complex cases only, parties must also use the Civil Case Cover Sheet to designate whether the is case is complex. If a plaintiff believes the case is complex under rule 3.400 of the California Rules of Court, this must be indicated by completing the appropriate boxes in items 1 and 2. If a plaintiff designates a case as complex, the cover sheet must be served with the complaint on all parties to the action. A defendant may file and serve no later than the time of its first appearance a joinder in the plaintiff's designation, a counter-designation that the case is not complex, or, if the plaintiff has made no designation, a designation that the case is complex.

22 Petitioner, SAVE HOLLYWOOD, a California unincorporated association,
23 a (*Petitioner") seeks a writ of mandamus, declaratory, and injunctive relief against
24 Respondents and Defendants City of Los Angeles and Los Angeles City Council (sometimes
25 collectively the "City"), and alleges as follows:
26 INTRODUCTION
27 1.
28 This petition challenges the City's January 31, 2018 decisions and all
subsequent actions in approving two variances from the Los Angeles Municipal Code

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 ("LAMC"), and a finding of Categorical Exemption from the California Environmental

2 Quality Act ("CEQA"). The entitlements granted by the City enable the owner of an existing

3 mixed-use building at 928 N. Western Avenue in East Hollywood to lease out the ground
4 floor of the property as a 6,875 a sq. ft. gymnasium, which is a use not otherwise permitted by
5 the underlying zoning. The first variance granted provides relief from the restrictions of

6 LAMC Section 12.10.5.A and Los Angeles Ordinance 177,115, which prohibit gymnasiums
7 in the Residential/Accessory Services RAS3 Zone; the second variance allows 60 feet of

8 illuminated signage for the gymnasium, whereas the RAS3 Zone restricts signage to 20 sq.
9 ft. per tenant, and prohibits such signage from having interior illumination ("Land Use
10 Entitlements").

11 2. Petitioner seeks a writ of mandamus invalidating the City's determination that
12 the Project is exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), based upon
13 violations of CEQA.

14 3. Petitioner further alleges that the City's approval of two variances from the
15 LAMC violates Los Angeles Municipal Code ("LAMC") Section 12.27.D and City Charter
16 Section 562. Petitioner also alleges that the City's Planning Department exceeded its
17 authority or acted without authority, in violation of Charter Section 561, in approving the
18 variances. Petitioner seeks a writ of mandamus invalidating and setting aside the variances
19 granted for the Project.

5 Management Committee held a public hearing to consider Petitioner's and Save

6 Hollywood's joint appeal, during which time Petitioner's representative gave testimony in

7 support of the appeal of the grant of the two variances, and of the City's finding that the

8 Project is Categorically Exempt from CEQA. Following public testimony, the Committee

9 voted to recommend to the City Council that it deny petitioner's appeal and approve the

10 Project.

11 17. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that on or about

28 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

5

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

(Violation of CEQA And CEQA Guidelines; Does Not Comply with CEQA)

2 23. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of
Paragraphs 1 through 22, inclusive, of this Petition.

4 24. CEQA requires a lead agency for a project to comply with the requirements of

5 the statute. The lead agency must also provide for public review and comment on the project

6 and associated environmental documentation. An agency must provide sufficient

7 environmental analysis such that decision-makers can intelligently consider environmental
consequences when acting on proposed projects.
25. The City's action in approving a Categorical Exemption for the Project
10 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion in that the City failed to proceed in the manner

11 required by law.

12 26. Section 21084 of the Public Resources Code requires the CEQA Guidelines to
13 include a list of categories of projects which have been determined not to have a significant
14 effect on the environment and which shall, therefore, be exempt from the provisions of
15 CEQA. (See CEQA Guidelines, § 15300.) These exemptions are commonly referred to as
16 "*categorical exemptions."

17 27. On its face, the CEQA exemption relied upon by Respondents does not apply
18 to the Project. The City exempted the Project from CEQA pursuant to the City's CEQA
19 Guidelines, Article III, Section One, Class One, Category One, stating that "there is no
20 substantial evidence demonstrating that an exception to a CE pursuant to CEQA Guidelines,
21 Section 15300.2 applies."

22 28. The categorical exemption identified by the City applies only to "interior or
23 exterior alterations, remodeling, or minor construction where there will be negligible or no
24 expansion of use." By law, it must be narrowly construed. Real parties' proposed project
25 does not fit into the scope of this exemption including because: (1) a gymnasium is not
26 permitted by the site's underlying RAS3 Zone, and therefore the City's grant of a variance to
27 allow the project involves a significant expansion of use; (2) The 2005 Mitigated Negative
28 Declaration ("MND") for the property's Zone and Height District Change did not analyze

6

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 traffic, parking, noise and other impacts related to the more intensive use of the prohibited

2 gymnasium; (3) the City improperly imposed a Condition of Approval requiring that "The

3 applicant shall incorporate sound mitigation measures to minimize noise from music,
4 vibrations, or any activity in the fitness center such as acoustical tiles, drÿ wall clips or

5 similar techniques to reduce sound vibrations," when an agency's reliance on mitigation
6 measures when adopting a categorical exemption is an impermissible end-run around

7 requirements for an MND, and (4) both the zoning administrator and members of the Central

8 Area Planning Commission stated during the Commission's public hearing that significant

9 noise impacts are, as noted by Commissioner Chemerinsky, "inherent in having a small gym
10 in a mixed-use development," "that could affect the neighborhood as well as people living in

11 the building." By attempting to squeeze the Project into a narrow CEQA exemption that, on

12 its face, does not apply, Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by CEQA.

13 29. CEQA further prohibits exemption of the Project from CEQA review because

14 there is a reasonable possibility that the project will have a significant effect on the
15 environment due to cumulative impacts. By CEQA Guidelines Section 15300.2, subdivision

16 (b), "All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the cumulative impact of

17 successive Projects of the same type in the same place, over time is significant." The project

18 establishes precedent for permitting the more intensive gymnasium use in not only the RAS

19 Zone, but potentially the surrounding C4 Zone. By exempting the Project from

20 environmental review under CEQA, in the face of a demonstrated reasonable possibility of a

21 significant effect on the environment, Respondents further failed to proceed in the manner

22 required by CEQA.

23 30. CEQA requires every lead agency to provide a good faith, reasoned analysis in

24 response to comments, to address recommendations and objections in detail, and to explain
25 why specific comments and suggestions, especially those of experts, were not accepted. The

26 City failed to respond adequately to comments on the Categorical Exemption, including
27 comments from Petitioner, and comments from members of the Central Area Planning
28 Commission, including but not limited to comments regarding land use and planning, noise,

7

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 parking, and traffic and circulation.

2 31. Because of the City's violations of CEQA, Petitioner has been harmed in that

3 Petitioner and other members of the public were not fully informed about the significant

4 environmental impacts of the Project prior to the City's approval of the Project and approval

5 of the Project as Categorically Exempt.

6 32. As a result of the foregoing defects, the City prejudicially abused its discretion

7 by adopting findings that do not comply with the requirements of CEQA and by approving

8 the Project in reliance thereon. Accordingly, the City's approval of the finding that the

9 Project is Categorically Exempt from CEQA, and approval of the Project and the Land Use

10 Entitlements, must be set aside.

11 33. Petitioner as well as members of the general public will suffer irreparable harm

12 if the relief requested herein is not granted and the Project is allowed to operate in the
13 absence of full and adequate CEQA review, and absent compliance with all other applicable
14 provisions of CEQA and other laws.

15 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

16 (Violation Of LAMC § 12.27.D; Improper Grant Of Variances to LAMC)

17 34. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of

18 Paragraphs 1 through 33, inclusive, of this Petition.

19 35. Section 12.27.D of the Los Angeles Municipal Code and Section 562 of the
20 City Charter require that a Variance be supported by written findings of all of the following:

21 a) That the strict application of the zoning ordinance
22 would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships

23 inconsistent with the general purpose and intent of the zoning regulations;

24 b) That there are exceptional circumstances
applicable to the subject property such as size, shape,
25 topography, location or surroundings that do not apply generally

26 to other property in the same zone and vicinity;
c) That the variance is necessary for the preservation
27 and enjoyment of a substantial property right or use generally

28 possessed by other property within the same zone and vicinity but which, because of the special circumstances and practical

8

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

aupwN- difficulties or unnecessary hardships is denied to the property in question;
d) That the granting of a variance will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements adjacent to or in the vicinity of the subject property; and
e) That the granting of the variance will not adversely affect any element of the general plan.

7 36.

8 Section 562 of the City Charter further states: "A variance shall not be used to

9 grant a special privilege, or to permit a use substantially inconsistent with the limitations
upon other properties in the same zone and vicinity."

10 37.

11 Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that the City
Council abused its discretion and otherwise violated the law in

12 that the findings are

13 incomplete, and as to those findings that were made and the subsequent approvals, those

14 were unsupported in fact or in law and do not satisfy the strict requirements of LAMC

15 Section 12.27.D and City Charter Section 562 to support the variances granted by the City
and City Council.

16 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

17

18 38. (Violation Of City Charter § 561)

19 Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of
Paragraphs 1 through 37, inclusive, of this Petition.

20 39.

21 Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that Los

22 Angeles City Charter Section 561 restricts the authority of the Office of Zoning
Administration as a "quasi-judicial" agency.

23 40.

24 Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that in 2005, the

25 City Council granted the property located at 928 N. Western Ave. a Zone and Height District

26 Change from the Commercial C4 Zone to the Residential/Accessory RAS3 Zone, with a (Q)

27 Qualifying Classification restricting uses on the site to those only allowed in the RAS3 Zone.

28 The RAS3 Zone does not allow gymnasiums. The City Council codified the grant of the
Zone and Height District Change as Ordinance Number 177,115.

9

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

41. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that including in

2 violation of Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.5(b), the Zoning Administrator acting

3 without, or in excess of, jurisdiction issued a determination in favor of Real Parties that

4 deviated from and violated the (Q) Condition legislatively enacted by the City Council,

5 pursuant to Ordinance Number 177,115.

6 42. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that the Zoning

7 Administrator abused its discretion by granting a use variance in direct conflict with the

8 legislative restrictions expressly imposed upon the property by the elected legislative body,

9 the City Council, thereby illegally providing Real Parties with a "back door," de facto zone
10 change.

11 PRAYER

12 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays entry of judgment as follows:
13 1. That this Court issue a peremptory writ of mandamus directing the City and

14 City Council to vacate and set aside its actions approving the Project, the Categorical
15 Exemption for the Project, and the Land Use Entitlements.

16 2. That this Court issue a peremptory writ of mandamus suspending the authority
17 of the City and City Council, their officers, employees, agents, boards, commissions and
18 other subdivisions, to grant any authority, permits or entitlements as part of the Project until
19 a valid and adequate environmental analysis is prepared, circulated, and certified as complete
20 consistent with CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, and all other applicable laws.

21 3. That this Court issue a temporary restraining order and a permanent injunction
22 enjoining the City and City Council, their officers, employees, agents, boards, commissions
23 and other subdivisions, as well as Real Parties in Interest, from undertaking any activities or
24 construction pursuant to the City's Project approvals as described herein, and prior to the
25 City's full compliance with CEQA.

26 4. That this Court issue a peremptory writ of mandamus directing the City and
27 City Council to vacate and set aside the actions approving the variances for the Project, and
28 that the Court invalidate the variances.

10

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

3 entitlements as part of the Project pursuant to the City's approvals of the variances described
4 herein.

5 6. That this Court enjoin Real Parties from undertaking any activities or
6 construction pursuant to the City's approval of the variances described herein.

7 7. That this Court award Petitioner its attorney fees, including under Code of
