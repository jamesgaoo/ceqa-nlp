PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1. Petitioners Friends of the Green Bridge (Friends) and Robert A. Johnston

2 (together, Petitioners) bring this action against Respondent California Department of

3 Transportation (Caltrans) and allege as follows:

4 THE CONTROVERSY

5 2. Caltrans intends to demolish and replace the existing short bridge over Lagunitas

6 Creek on State Route (SR) 1 in western Marin County, located immediately south of the

7 unincorporated town of Point Reyes Station (the Project). The existing bridge is in every sense

8 of the word "historic" and is affectionately referred to by local residents as the "Green Bridge.'

9 The Green Bridge was built in 1929 and serves as the gateway to Point Reyes Station and Point
10 Reyes National Seashore.

11 3. When Caltrans publicly announced the proposed bridge replacement Project in

12 early 2015, Caltrans said that demolition and replacement is necessary because the bridge does

13 not meet current standards for earthquake resistance and could fail during a seismic event.

14 Caltrans stated that Project construction would take three years and involve the erection of a
15 temporary one-lane bridge and alternating one-way traffic over that temporary bridge during the
16 construction period.

17 4. Given the extraordinary economic, community, and environmental impacts
18 anticipated from the Project, beginning in 2015 and at every public comment opportunity since

19 then numerous local residents (including Petitioners) repeatedly requested that Caltrans conduct

20 engineering evaluations of the Green Bridge to identify and evaluate its specific seismic risks

21 and vulnerabilities, and to then identify and evaluate options for conducting a seismic retrofit of

22 the existing bridge to address those risks and vulnerabilities, in lieu of demolition and

23 replacement. Caltrans, however, was determined from the outset to simply demolish and replace

24 the Green Bridge. As a result, it declared retrofit to be "infeasible" and steadfastly refused to

25 seriously consider or evaluate any legitimate seismic retrofit options, contrary to its own
26 statewide policies which require Caltrans to retrofit bridges and "do no more than is necessary to

27 prevent collapse."

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 5. Caltrans, acting as the "lead agency," is required by the California Environmental

2 Quality Act (CEQA) to evaluate the environmental impacts of the Project, including a reasonable

3 range of alternatives. Typically, the first step in the CEQA process is to conduct "scoping,' in

4 which the lead agency solicits input from the public and agencies on the scope of the project,

5 alternatives to the project, and potential resources or issues that may be affected by the project.
6 Following the scoping process, the lead agency is required to develop a reasonable range of

7 alternatives, and then evaluate the impacts of the proposed project and such alternatives through

8 either an initial study or an environmental impact report (EIR).

9 6. During Caltrans' scoping process for the Project, Caltrans received numerous
10 comments requesting that Caltrans identify and evaluate seismic retrofit alternatives. In

11 response, Caltrans instead sought "more justification for bridge replacement." In late 2015
12 Caltrans convened a "Stakeholder Working Group" (SWG) of twelve government agency
13 representatives and four hand-picked individuals to meet in secret to provide "community input"

14 to Caltrans on the Project. The SWG meetings were closed to the public, and to the press.
15 Despite Petitioners' repeated requests, the materials presented by Caltrans to the SWG for the
16 SWG's reviewed were never made public. What is known is that Caltrans did not provide the
17 SWG with its Lagunitas Creek Bridge Seismic Evaluation Report, or several other important and
18 relevant reports (e.g., Preliminary Foundation Report, Natural Environmental Study, and

19 Hydraulic Study Report) because Caltrans did not prepare those reports until at least a year a after

20 the SWG process concluded. Instead, Caltrans told the SWG that a "retrofit" of the Green

21 Bridge would require the piece-by-piece replacement of every single piece of the existing bridge

22 (which is a not a retrofit at all, but rather the construction of a new bridge).

23 7. The SWG met with Caltrans three times. In April 2016, the SWG process

24 concluded, and Caltrans announced that the SWG members "were not supportive of the Retrofit
25 Alternative." Caltrans subsequently relied upon the SWG's "determination" as justification for

26 not identifying and evaluating any seismic retrofit alternatives in the EIR.

27

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

8. Caltrans released the Project's Draft EIR (DEIR) for public review and comment

2 in mid-2017. The DEIR evaluated the CEQA-mandated "no action" alternative and numerous

3 "demolish and replace" alternatives, but failed to include even a single seismic retrofit

4 alternative. Caltrans released the Final EIR (FEIR) in July 2018, which selected one of the

5 "demolish and replace" alternatives as the final Project design.

6 9. Caltrans failed to proceed in the manner required by law and abused its discretion

7 by completely disregarding the environmental review process, its own policies, and CEQA by

8 failing to evaluate a reasonable range of alternatives during the environmental review process.

9 Caltrans also abused its discretion by rejecting any retrofit alternative as infeasible and not

10 carrying forward one or more retrofit alternatives for evaluation in the DEIR and FEIR, without

11 adequate data or analysis. Caltrans also failed to proceed in the manner required by law and

12 abused its discretion by failing to adequately analyze the impacts of the Project, or the provide

13 substantial evidence in support of its analyses. Petitioner asks this Court to set aside Caltrans'

14 approval of the Project and further direct Caltrans to identify and evaluate one or more legitimate

15 seismic retrofit alternatives in a new DEIR. The issuance of such relief will ensure that Caltrans
16 discharges its duty pursuant to CEQA to adequately consider whether retrofitting the historic

17 Green Bridge is a viable alternative.

18 VENUE

19 10. Venue is proper in this Court because Caltrans' acts and omissions giving rise to

20 the instant controversy took place in Marin County. The Project at issue is also located in Marin

21 County.

22 PARTIES

23 11. Petitioner Friends of the Green Bridge is a California non-profit association
24 located in Marin County. Friends is concerned with the environmental, social, and economic
25 impacts the proposed Project will have on the community. Its members enjoy the Green
26 Bridge's history and aesthetics and enjoy using the bridge to traverse Lagunitas Creek.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

12. Petitioner Robert A. Johnston is a long-time resident of Point Reyes Station,
2 California and President of Petitioner Friends.

13. Respondent California Department of Transportation is an executive agency of
4 the State of California, headquartered in Sacramento, California, and is a Project applicant and

5 lead agency approving the Project.

6 PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS

7 14. Petitioners participated in the CEQA process and raised all of the concerns raised
8 herein. During the CEQA process, Caltrans was made aware of these deficiencies in the CEQA

9 process, but they were ignored.

10 15. The Notice of Determination for the Project was filed on July 3, 2018. Therefore l

11 this action has been timely filed in compliance with Public Resources Code 21167.

12 16. This action is brought consistent with the requirements of the Public Resources
13 Code section 21177 and Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094. Petitioners have
14 exhausted all available administrative remedies in connection with Caltrans's approval of the

15 Project.

16 17. Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code section 21667.5, by
17 providing Caltrans notice of Petitioners' intent to commence this action.

18 18. Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.7, Petitioners have served a

19 copy of this Petition on the California Attorney General's office. '

20 THE PROJECT

21 19. Caltrans proposes to demolish and replace the Green Bridge over Lagunitas Creek

22 on - State Route 1 in Marin County. Caltrans' FEIR states that the purpose of the Project is to

23 "provide a safe, seismically stable crossing of Lagunitas Creek on SR 1." The existing bridge is
24 within the jurisdiction of Caltrans District 4, headquartered in Oakland, California.

25 20. Lagunitas Creek and its surrounds, both in general and at the specific location of

26 the Project, is an extremely sensitive habitat area which is used and occupied by numerous
27 animal species protected by the federal Endangered Species Act, the California Endangered

28
-4-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act, including

2 but not limited to endangered coho salmon and steelhead, California freshwater shrimp,
tidewater goby, California tiger salamander, and California red-legged frog.

4 21. The Project is a joint project by Caltrans and the Federal Highway Administration

5 (FHWA) and is subject to state and federal environmental review requirements. Caltrans, as the

6 lead agency, is required analyze the environmental impacts of the Project in compliance with

7 both CEQA and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).

8 22. SR is a 549-mile-long major north-south state highway that runs along most of

9 the Pacific coastline. The entire length of SR 1 in Marin County is listed as being eligible for
10 designation as a State Scenic Highway.

11 23. The Project site is located at post mile (PM) 28.5, south of the unincorporated

12 town of Point Reyes Station in Marin County. The Project limits extend from SR 1 PMs 28.4 to

13 28.6, from the "T" intersection with Sir Francis Drake Boulevard north to B Street in Point

14 Reyes Station. Nearby recreation areas include Whitehouse Pool Park, Point Reyes National

15 Seashore, two tracts of the Golden Gate National Recreational Area, and Tomales Bay

16 Ecological Reserve.

17 24. The Green Bridge was constructed in 1929 by Marin County, and serves as a vital
18 connection between Point Reyes Station and the unincorporated town of Olema to the south.

19 The Green Bridge is a 152-foot-long, 34-foot-wide, three span bridge that has two 11-foot-wide
20 lanes, a 2-foot-wide shoulder on its east side, and a 3-foot-wide sidewalk on its west side.

21 25. The Project, as approved, would demolish and replace the Green Bridge with a

22 new bridge that would have 11-foot-wide northbound and southbound lanes and 5-foot-wide

23 shoulders on both sides. The new bridge would also accommodate one 6-foot-wide sidewalk on

24 the west side of the bridge with railings or barriers to separate it from the shoulder and travel

25 lanes.

26 CALTRANS APPROVED THE PROJECT WITHOUT CONSIDERING
RETROFITTING THE EXISTING BRIDGE AS A PROJECT ALTERNATIVE
27

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

26. In 2007, Caltrans added a work recommendation to "perform the seismic retrofit

2 of the steel truss members" of the Lagunitas Creek Bridge to its STRAIN (Structure
3 Replacement and Improvement Needs) report.

4 27. Caltrans Division of Engineering Services (DES) Memo to Designers (MD) 20-4,

5 "Seismic Retrofit Guidelines for Bridges in California" (June 2016)' (sets Caltrans policy and
6 procedures for the seismic retrofit of California bridges). It states that the "primary performance
7 standard for retrofitting bridges is to prevent the structure from reaching the collapse limit state

8 for the Design Earthquake. The goal of this "No Collapse" performance standard is to protect

9 human life and there are no serviceability expectations for retrofitted bridges." It further
10 provides that Caltrans' retrofit strategy "is to do no more than is necessary to prevent collapse."
11 The "No Collapse" performance standard "only requires the minimum seismic retrofit to prevent |
12 collapse." MD 20-4 mandates an initial assessment of the structure and development of a retrofit
13 strategy. It also provides that the "designer must consider costs when developing a retrofit
14 bridge model. For instance, the abutment and superstructure can sometimes be modified to
15 reduce demands to the columns at considerable savings a over a column and foundation retrofit."
16 Here, Caltrans failed to follow its own detailed, written policies and procedures in proposing |

17 bridge replacement as the only viable alternative.

18 28. Caltrans' Preliminary Seismic Design Recommendation (July 30, 2010) for the

19 Green Bridge indicates that Caltrans had internally proposed full bridge replacement no later
20 than July 1, 2010. Caltrans' internal "full replacement" decision was made without having
21 conducted the seismic analysis required by MD 20-4 or analyzing the environmental impacts of

22 retrofit.

23 29. On March 12, 2015, Caltrans filed a Notice of Preparation initiating the 30-
24 scoping process for the Project, which was later extended to 60 days upon public request.

25 30. In March 2015, Caltrans held the initial public meeting for the Project. Caltrans
26 described the project as: "replace[ing] the current bridge over Lagunitas Creek in SR-1 with a

27

28 http://www.dot.ca.gov/des/techpubs/manuals/bridge-memo-to-designer/page/section-20/20- 4.pdf

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

new bridge." Caltrans requested feedback regarding "the range of reasonable alternatives being
2 proposed," but stated that the only alternatives "under consideration" were full replacement

3 alternatives. However, Caltrans again, without having completed any seismic analysis,

4 concluded that "retrofitting the bridge was [ ] infeasible." Caltrans' stated that the bridge
5 replacement would require three years of construction, including construction of a temporary

6 one-lane bridge and alternating one-way traffic over that single-lane bridge for the duration of

7 the three-year construction period.

8 31. During the scoping process, Caltrans received extensive oral and written

9 comments from regulatory agencies, businesses, local associations and members of the public.

10 Many commenters stated that Caltrans' proposal would be an economic disaster for Point Reyes

11 Station businesses and an intolerable inconvenience for local residents, and demanded that

12 Caltrans propose a faster solution and analyze seismic retrofit as a project alternative to full
13 demolition and reconstruction. For example, the Point Reyes Station Village Association
14 requested that Caltrans commission an independent engineering study to evaluate the viability of

15 repairing, restoring and maintaining the current bridge. Additionally, the Inverness Association

16 stated that Caltrans must evaluate "two additional alternatives: (a) repairing, or (b) retrofitting

17 the existing bridge." The Inverness Ridge Association stated that "Caltrans should reconsider
18 alternatives to replacement of the bridge and seek added professional input on the feasibility of
19 retrofitting the existing structure." A local structural engineer with bridge seismic design

20 experience reviewed the as-built drawings of the Green Bridge, then inspected the bridge, then in

21 written comments stated that "conventional Caltrans Retrofit procedures should be able to

22 address the types of deficiencies identified" by Caltrans. Another commenter stated that in

23 proposing only bridge replacement alternatives and no retrofit alternatives, Caltrans was relying

24 only on general statements related to the age of the structure and a 4-page Bridge Inspection

25 Report from 2014 which was based on a brief and superficial visual inspection of only the most

26 easily accessible portions of the bridge.

27

28
-7-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

32. At the conclusion of scoping, Caltrans' own "Scoping Summary Report"
2 (September 3, 2015) stated that many commenters requested more information regarding a
3 retrofit alternative in the form of a study, and additional information on the structural
4 vulnerabilities of the current bridge while investigating the possibility of retrofitting. This

5 Caltrans report concluded: "The majority of commenters expressed their preference to evaluate
6 retrofit alternative."

7 33. In October 2015, Caltrans held a second public and solicited additional public
8 comments. At the meeting Caltrans provided "updated information about the current bridge,
9 planning efforts to date and considerations in forming the range of possible alternatives."
10 Caltrans proposed several bridge replacement alternatives, including an "Accelerated Bridge
11 Construction" (ABC) approach wherein the new replacement bridge would be built nearby, but

12 offsite. This ABC approach would require one year of preparatory construction at the bridge site,
13 then closure of SR 1 for three weeks to demolish the existing bridge and install the newly
14| constructed bridge.

15 34. At the October 2015 public meeting, Caltrans also presented limited information
16 regarding a "retrofit/rehabilitate alternative." Caltrans concluded that under the retrofit
17 alternative "only truss would remain all other structural pieces replaced." However, Caltrans
18 stated that an "advance planning study" was underway to analyze the feasibility of a retrofit
19 alternative. To Petitioners' knowledge the study was never prepared.

20 35. During and after the October 2015 public meeting the public again submitted

21 extensive comments demanding that Caltrans analyze seismic retrofit alternatives. Several
22 commenters reiterated their prior requests that Caltrans conduct a detailed engineering analysis

23 of the specific seismic risks of the Green Bridge, and the identification and evaluation of

24 potential alternatives for reducing those risks to an acceptable level through retrofit. Caltrans

25 committed at the October 2015 public meeting to do just that. Caltrans subsequently published
26 the following statement on its Project website: "Please note: Caltrans is preparing a technical

27 design study for a retrofit alternative, which is expected to be ready by 2016."

28
-8-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

36. However, an internal Caltrans memorandum obtained through a Public Records

2 Act request, states only that because of public testimony at the October 2015 meeting, "the

3 Department was asked to provide more justification for bridge replacement."

4 37. Rather than conduct the promised technical design study for a retrofit alternative,

5 Caltrans sought to bolster its justification for demolition and replacement by orchestrating the

6 "rejection" of a sham retrofitting option the "community." In late 2015 Caltrans created a

7 "Stakeholder Working Group" (SWG) consisting of a dozen government agency representatives

8 and four hand-picked members of the public, ostensibly to obtain "community input" on the

9 Project. Caltrans met with the SWG three times in early 2016, for a couple of hours each

10 meeting. Caltrans prohibited other members of the public, and the local press, from attending

11 these meetings.

12 38. The only public record of the SWG meetings are Caltrans-produced minutes.

13 Caltrans' minutes show that Caltrans discussed the details of potential retrofitting with the SWG
14 just once, at the January 26, 2016 meeting. The minutes of that meeting show, confirmed by

15 subsequent Caltrans statements, that Caltrans told the SWG that "retrofit" of the existing bridge

16 would require "piece-by-piece replacement" of every single piece of the existing bridge. This

17 "retrofit" approach presented to the SWG (which of course is not a "retrofit" at all but instead a
18 rebuilding of the entire bridge) was not supported by any detailed evaluation of the specific

19 seismic risks and vulnerabilities of the existing bridge. Caltrans further told the SWG that this

20 "retrofit" would take far longer, be far more disruptive, and have far greater environmental

21 impacts than Caltrans' newly proposed ABC demolition and replacement proposal.

22 39. In March 2016, Caltrar published a Project newsletter discussing the results of

23 the SWG meetings. Not surprisingly, the newsletter states that Caltrans "reviewed the possibility

24 of retrofitting the existing bridge as an additional alternative to bridge replacement" and that the

25 "SWG supported not carrying this alternative into further review."

26 40. Caltrans published a second Project newsletter in June 2016. It contains no

27 discussion of any retrofit alternative. Instead, the newsletter states that "Caltrans has determined

28
-9-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

the existing structure has several key deficiencies and would likely fail in a significant seismic
2 event." But in fact, Caltrans had still not performed any seismic engineering analyses at that

3 point.

4 41. As noted above, as of June 2016, Caltrans' Project website said: "(Please note:

5 Caltrans is preparing a technical design study for a retrofit alternative, which is expected to be
6 ready by 2016)." Caltrans later removed this statement from the Project website. To Petitioner's

7 knowledge, no technical design study for a retrofit alternative was ever prepared.

8 42. On August 4, 2016, Caltrans Structure Maintenance and Investigations (SM&N)

9 convened a "strategy meeting" to determine alternatives to address the bridge's structural needs.

10 A December 7, 2016, internal Caltrans memorandum describes the results of the meeting. SM&I

11 concluded that replacement was the most viable alternative. However, to help answer questions

12 from the public, SM&I requested three additional studies: analysis of the existing bridge's

13 seismic retrofit needs; evaluation of the bridge's steel truss member properties; and an updated
14 live load analysis. "As the three studies are completed, they will be forwarded to SM&I for their
15  consideration. If the results provide new information to SM&I, they may convene another
16 formal review of the bridge status/condition and re-evaluate their recommendation to retrofit the

17 bridge or replace the bridge."

18 43. SM&I requested that the studies be presented as a "Seismic Strategy Report."
19 The report must: (1) be completed in conformance with Caltrans' Memo to Designers 20-4; (2)
20 contain a seismic hazard analysis report documenting site-specific seismic demands developed

21 by the Office of Geotechnical Design West; (3) contain retrofit measures developed to address

22 the Memo to Designers 20-4 "no collapse" performance standard; and (4) contain a cost estimatel

23 for the retrofit measures recommended.

24 44. In September 2016, Caltrans' lead consultant for the Project confirmed that the

25 "retrofit" Caltrans proposed to the SWG was not a retrofit, but a complete rebuild, and that the
26 DEIR for the Project was almost entirely written but might be "tweaked" slightly after some new

27 bits of information are developed.

28

- 45.

2 On December 8, 2016, Caltrans issued a "Draft Preliminary Foundation Report
for Lagunitas Creek Bridge." The report indicates that Caltrans was studying five bridge
3 alternatives, not including a retrofit alternative. "No seismic retrofit study has been formally

4

5 performed. No consideration is given to retrofit of the bridge neither [sic] to use of existing pier
footings for the currently proposed replacement."

6 46.

7 On March 8, 2017, Caltrans issued its first seismic analysis - the "Lagunitas
Creek Bridge Seismic Evaluation Report," purporting to comply with MD 20-4. This Seismic
8 Evaluation Report evaluates the current seismic risk conditions of the bridge. It contains a

o "Recommended Seismic Retrofit," which "upgrades the bridge to the performance level of "no
10 collapse." The proposed retrofit requires Caltrans to "Replace existing bearings at bent 2 and

11

12 bent 3 with new bearings," "Construct 2 Cast-In-Steel [] piles at each bent," "Construct bent cap

13 at bent 2 and bent 3," and "Replace existing non-ductile columns at abutments with seat type

abutment."

14 47. The Seismic Evaluation Report concludes that the retrofit is feasible and can be
15 "constructed with one lane closure."

16 48.

17 Caltrans' own March 2017 "Recommended Seismic Retrofit" is far different and

18 less extensive than the "replace every piece of the bridge piece-by-piece" "retrofit" that Caltrans
consistently presented to the public and the SWG.
19 Evaluation Report alternative for analysis in the DEIR. Caltrans did not include the Seismic

20 49.

21 The Seismic Evaluation Report does not include a cost estimate for Caltrans'
Recommended Seismic Retrofit. The actual cost of retrofitting the bridge, if known to Caltrans,
22 has never been made public. MD 20-4 requires Caltrans to determine the cost of retrofit.

23 50. Public comments submitted to Caltrans during the CEQA process also
24 demonstrated that there are several additional reasonable, feasible retrofit alternatives which will

25 achieve the Project's stated purpose and the Green Bridge's need for seismic safety, and with
26 significantly less environmental effects. Caltrans refused to evaluate these submitted alternatives

27 in the DEIR and FEIR.

28
-11-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

51. On April 24, 2017, Caltrans published an Alternatives Analysis Report. The
2 report purportedly "documents the alternatives analysis conducted to identify the range of

3 alternatives to be carried forward into the" DEIR. But it does no more than provide a superficial

4 analysis of the range of retrofit alternatives in order to justify Caltrans' conclusion that the Green

5 Bridge must be replaced. As purported justification for not analyzing any seismic retrofit

6 alternatives in the DEIR, the Report says the following about the sham "retrofit" for which it

7 orchestrated a "rejection" by the SWG: "A detailed retrofit approach was prepared and made

8 available to the public and the SWG via the project website" and "the SWG determined that they
9 were not supportive of the Retrofit Alternative."

10 52. In April 2017 Caltrans published a third Project newsletter stating that a retrofit

11 alternative "was not carried forward" for analysis in the DEIR because "retrofitting the bridge to

12 meet today's seismic requirements would result in far more disturbance than a full replacement"

13 and that "a retrofit effort is unpredictable and could result in unforeseen costs and delays." As
14 discussed above, there is no evidence that Caltrans ever analyzed the environmental impact or

15 cost of the retrofit alternative.

16 53. Caltrans issued the DEIR for public review on April 26, 2017. The DEIR did not

17 analyze or evaluate any seismic retrofit alternative, not even Caltrans' own "Recommended
18 Seismic Retrofit" alternative from its own March 2017 Seismic Evaluation Report. Indeed, the
19 DEIR makes barely any mention of the March 2017 Seismic Evaluation Report. By not
20| analyzing a seismic retrofit alternative in the DEIR, Caltrans precluded any seismic retrofit

21 alternative from being evaluated by the public, or being selected as the final Project, thus
22 guaranteeing (absent judicial review) Caltrans' predetermined outcome complete bridge

23 demolition and replacement.

24 54. The DEIR, in addition to failing to analyze a reasonable range of alternatives,

25 failed to properly and adequately identify, analyze, and/or mitigate several of the Project's
26 significant environmental impacts.

27

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

55. The DEIR was circulated to the a public for a 45-day review and comment period,

2 which ended on June 9, 2017. Caltrans held two public hearings: May 10, 2017 and June 15,
2017. Based on the public input at the first public meeting, Caltrans extended the public
4 comment period for two additional weeks until June 24, 2017.

5 56. Caltrans received a total of 392 comment letter submittals and individual

6 statements at the public hearings during the public review period for the DEIR. Caltrans

7 received two submittals from state agencies and three submittals from local agencies. Ten

8 submittals were received from businesses, and five submittals were received from organizations.
9 Caltrans received 332 submittals from individuals. The overwhelming majority of the public

10 comments were in favor of the "No Build" alternative, and/or requested again that Caltrans

11 prepare a new DEIR analyzing a true seismic retrofit alternative.

12 57. On June 26, 2018, Caltrans released an "Addendum to the State Route 1

13 Lagunitas Creek Bridge Alternatives Analysis Technical Report." The Addendum was prepared

14 as a result of public comment requesting that "Caltrans review a range of retrofit alternatives or a

15 'less intensive retrofit alternative.' The Addendum describes the variety of efforts that would
16 purportedly be needed to meet the "no collapse" design criteria. The Addendum concludes that
17 retrofitting the existing bridge remains an unviable alternative. On June 29, 2018, Caltrans

18 certified the Final Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Assessment/finding of No

19 Significant Impact (FEIR) for the Project. Like the DEIR, the FEIR is deficient in several

20 respects, including failing to analyze a reasonable range of alternatives and failing to identify,

21 analyze, and/or mitigate several of the Project's significant environmental impacts.

22 58. The FEIR contains significant new information, not contained in the DEIR, and

23 by so doing Caltrans has deprived the public of a meaningful opportunity to comment on
24 substantial adverse project impacts or feasible mitigation measures or alternatives.

25 59. On July 3, 2018, Caltrans filed a Notice of Determination for the Project. The

26 Notice of Determination however, was never posted to Caltrans' Project website and was not
27 posted to the Office of Planning and Research's website until more than a week later.

3 analysis, has deprived the Petitioners and the public of informed decision making and

4 participation. Caltrans failure to identify, analyze, and mitigate several of the Project's

5 significant environmental impacts puts Lagunitas Creek, which is habitat to many sensitive and

6 state and federally protected plant and wildlife species, and the community in danger.

7 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

8 (Mandamus Challenge Under CCP §§ 1094 and/or 1085 to Caltrans'
Approval of the Project - Failure to Consider Reasonable Alternatives)
61. Petitioners hereby incorporate each paragraph set forth above.
10 62. EIRs must describe a reasonable range of alternatives sufficient to permit
11 informed decision making and public participation. Pub. Resources Code §§ 21002,
12 21100(b)(4), 21150; CEQA Guidelines § 15126.6. The discussion of alternatives is the "core" of
13 an EIR. "The range of potential alternatives to the proposed project shall include those that
14 could feasibly accomplish most of the basic objectives of the project and could avoid or
15 substantially lessen one or more of the significant effects." CEQA Guidelines § 15126.6(c). The
16 lead agency must adequately justify its decision to reject as infeasible any alternative considered
17 by the lead agency during the scoping process. Id.

18 63. As explained above, Caltrans approved the Project without considering a
19 reasonable range of alternatives, including one or more legitimate seismic retrofit alternatives.
20 Caltrans lacked justification for excluding from analysis in the EIR any retrofit alternative,
21 including Caltrans' own March 2017 "Recommended Seismic Retrofit," as well as other seismic
22 retrofit options submitted to Caltrans through public comment.
23 64. Caltrans failed to proceed in the manner required by land and/or prejudicially
24  abused its discretion by taking the above-described actions in violation of CEQA. Caltrans
25 failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and Caltrans' decision was not supported by
26 substantial evidence in the record.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 65. Pursuant to CCP §§ 1094 and/or 1085, Petitioners seek a writ voiding Caltrans'

2 approval of the Project on the grounds that such a decision was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of

3 discretion, or otherwise unlawful because Caltrans failed to consider a reasonable range of

4 alternatives.

5 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

6 (Administrative Mandamus Challenge Under CCP §§ 1094 and/or 1085 to Caltrans' Approval of the Project - Failure to Analyze and Mitigate Environmental Impacts)
7 66. Petitioners hereby incorporate each paragraph set forth above.

8 67. An EIR must identify and describe the significant environmental impacts that will

9 result from the project. CEQA Guidelines § 15126.2(a). The EIR must be prepared with a
10 sufficient degree of analysis to provide decisionmakers with information which enables them to
11 make a decision which intelligently takes account of environmental consequences. CEQA
12 Guidelines $ 15151.

13 68. An EIR must also describe feasible mitigation measures which could minimize or

14 negate the project's significant adverse impacts. CEQA Guidclincs § 15126.4(a)(1). Mitigation

15 measures must be fully enforceable and their formulation should not be deferred until some

16 future time. CEQA Guidelines §§ 15126.4(a)(1)(B), 15126.4(a)(2).

17 69. The EIR fails to identify and/or analyze the Project's significant environmental

18 impacts, and fails to formulate definite, enforceable, mitigation measures designed to avoid or
19 minimize the Project's significant environmental impacts. For example, the EIR fails to
20 adequately identify and analyze the Project's construction impacts and impermissibly defers
21 development of a "construction management plan" to mitigate the Project's impacts.

22 70. The EIR also fails to adequately analyze the Project's impacts on the community,

23 nearby properties, parks and recreational facilities, traffic, visual and aesthetic values, hydrology,

24 noise, hazardous materials and waste, and biological resources. More specifically, the EIR fails

25 to adequately identify and analyze the Project's:
26

27

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 a. impacts from construction on nearby properties and parks and recreation/

2 facilities, including access restrictions, pedestrian and bicycle facilities, noise, dust, and

3 vibrations.

4 b. economic impacts on the community.

5 C. impacts on traffic, including the proposed 3-way stop, reduced traffic

6 speeds, and one-way reversing traffic control.

7 d. impacts on water quality and sensitive plant and wildlife species in

8 Lagunitas Creek.

e. impacts on biological resources, including wetlands and other waters,
10 sensitive or special status plant and wildlife species.

11 f. impacts on the navigable waters of Lagunitas Creek, which are subject to
12 the federal Clean Water Act, including Section 404, the Lake and Streambed Alteration
13 Agreement requirement of California Fish and Game Code section 1600 et. seq, Fish and Game

14 Code section 5650, and Water Code section 13264.

15 g. impacts from hazardous material release and contamination.

16 h. noise impacts on the Marin Sun Farms restaurant and the Point Reyes

17 Animal Hospital, and other nearby residences and businesses.

18 71. The EIR also impermissibly defers the formulation of definite, enforceable, l

19 mitigation measures. For example,

20 a. Mitigation Measure BIO-1 requires Caltrans to, at some undefined future

21 date, determine the mitigation ratio for native and non-native riparian tree replacement necessary
22 to minimize impacts resulting from tree removal in the riparian zone of Lagunitas Creek.

23 b. Mitigation Measure BIO-2 requires Caltrans to develop a wetland
24 restoration plan but does not specify any performance standards for development of the plan.

25 C. Mitigation Measure BIO-A requires Caltrans to finalize a planting plan to
26 mitigate the Project's impacts on jurisdictional water features but does not specify any
27 performance standards for finalization of the plan.

28
-16-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

d. Mitigation Measure BIO-B requires Caltrans to mitigate the impacts on

2 Coho Salmon by developing a Habitat Mitigation Monitoring Plan to enhance the streambed

3 within Lagunitas Creek Biological Study Area, but only requires Caltrans to ensure its

4 effectiveness for one year. This is inadequate time to ensure the effectiveness of a mitigation

5 measure.

6 e. Mitigation Measure BIO-C states that "the final determinations of habitat
7 impacts and required compensatory mitigation will be coordinated with regulatory agencies.

8 Caltrans will mitigate, as needed, for permanent impacts to California Red Legged Frog through

9 onsite habitat enhancements." This constitutes an impermissible deferral of mitigation.

10 f. AMM BIO-1 requires Caltrans to minimize impacts resulting from tree

11 removal but impermissibly defers the determination of the mitigation ratio for native and non-

12 native riparian tree replacement to some future date.

13 g. AMM BIO-7 requires Caltrans to conduct surveys for foraging Myrtle's

14 Silverspot Butterfly (MSB) adults ahead of vegetation clearing but does not specify measures to

15 be implemented should MSB be discovered.

16 h. Mitigation Measure HAZ-8 requires Caltrans to prepare a Health and

17 Safety Plan and Lead Compliance Plan to prevent exposure of construction workers to hazardous

18 materials. HAZ-8 however, fails to address, or mitigate, the potential exposure of adjacent

19 residents, pedestrians and bicyclists to hazardous materials.

20 i. Mitigation Measure NOISE-1 requires Caltrans to restrict "overly loud"
21 construction activities "where feasible,' but fails to define "overly loud.33

22 j. AMM VIBRATION-1 states that potential for high vibratory annoyance

23 and/or structural damage from the proposed construction equipment is possible, then the
24 construction methods and equipment will be adjusted to avoid vibration-related damage.
25 However, it does not specify compensatory mitigation should Caltrans be unable to avoid
26 vibration-related damage.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

72. Caltrans failed to proceed in the manner required by land and/or prejudicially
2 abused its discretion by taking the above-described actions in violation of CEQA. Caltrans

3 failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and Caltrans' decision was not supported by
4 substantial evidence in the record.

5 73. Pursuant to CCP §§ 1094 and/or 1085 Petitioners seek a writ voiding Caltrans'
6 approval of the Project on the grounds that such a decision was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of
7 discretion, or otherwise unlawful because Caltrans failed adequately identify, analyze and/or

8 mitigate the Project's environmental impacts.

THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

10 (Mandamus Challenge Under CCP §§ 1094 and/or 1085 to Caltrans'

11 Approval of the Project - Predetermination)
74.
12 Petitioners hereby incorporate each paragraph set forth above.

75.
13 Purpose of CEQA is to make informed decisions and the environmental review

14 process must be performed in good faith.

76.
15 The full consideration of environmental effects CEQA mandates must not be
reduced to a
16 process whose result will be largely to generate paper, produce an EIR that

17 describes a journey whose destination is already predetermined. Save Tara v. City of West

18 Hollywood, 45 Cal.4th 116, 135 (2008).

77.
19 Caltrans decision to approve the Project violated CEQA because the decision was

20 predetermined. In other words, prior to completing or initiating the CEQA review process,

21 Caltrans decided that it was going to demolish and replace the Green Bridge to the exclusion of

other alternative.
22
78.
23 Pursuant to CCP §§ 1094 and/or 1085 Petitioners seek a writ voiding Caltrans'

24 approval of the Project on the grounds that such a decision was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of

25 discretion, or otherwise unlawful.
FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
26 (Mandamus Challenge Under CCP §§ 1094 and/or 1085 to Caltrans'
27 Approval of the Project - Recirculation Required)

28 79. Petitioners hereby incorporate each paragraph set forth above.
-18-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

80. A lead agency is required to recirculate an EIR when significant new information

2 is added to the EIR after public notice is given of the availability of the draft EIR for public

3 review under but before certification. Public. Resources Code § 21092.1; CEQA Guidelines §

4 15088.5; Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth v. City of Rancho Cordova (2007) 40

5 Cal.App.4th 412. Recirculation is also required when the addition of new information deprives

6 the public of a meaningful opportunity to comment on substantial adverse project impacts or

7 feasible mitigation measures or alternatives that are not adopted. Laurel Heights Improvement

8 Assoc. V. Regents of University of California (1993) 6 Cal.4th 1112.

9 81. Recirculation is required because, as explained above, the EIR fails to adequately

10 analyze a reasonable range of Project alternatives, including Caltrans' "Recommended Seismic

11 Retrofit," as well as other seismic retrofit options submitted to Caltrans through public comment.

12 82. Recirculation is also required because the public was deprived of an adequate

13 opportunity to review and comment on the significant new information that Caltrans presented at

14 the June 15, 2017, public meeting.

15 83. Recirculation is also required because the public was deprived of an adequate

16 opportunity to review and comment on significant new information contained in the FEIR but

17 not in the DEIR.

18 84. The Addendum to the State Route Lagunitas Creek Bridge Alternatives

19 Analysis Technical Report released by Caltrans after the DEIR was circulated also constitutes

20 significant new information requiring recirculation.

21 85. Caltrans failed to proceed in the manner required by law and prejudicially abused

22 its discretion by taking the above-described actions in violation of CEQA. Caltrans failed to

23 proceed in the manner required by law, and Caltrans' decision was not supported by substantial
24 evidence in the record.

25 86. Pursuant to CCP §§ 1094 and/or 1085, Petitioners seek a writ voiding Caltrans'
26 approval of the Project on the grounds that such a decision was a arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of

27 discretion, or otherwise unlawful because Caltrans failed to recirculate the DEIR.
