1 I. INTRODUCTION

2 1. On June 12, 2018 and June 26, 2018, the City of Loma Linda, by and through
its City Council, (collectively referred to herein as "Respondents"), adopted a series of
resolutions and ordinances, inter alia, Resolution Numbers 2979 and 2980 and Ordinance

5 Numbers 747, 748, and 749, which approved Special Planning Area "D," or "The Groves at

6 Loma Linda" (collectively, "Project"), and certified the Environmental Impact Report (EIR)
7 for the Project (State Clearinghouse No. 2018021064). The Project proposes a variety of
8 phased commercial, institutional, residential and mixed uses across 300 acres, including at least
481 dwelling units, 20 acres of mixed-use retail, residential and commercial, 26.5 acres of
10 parks, open space, and trails, and 10.1 acres of roadways and infrastructure. Project approvals
11 include: (1) General Plan Amendment No. 18-048, to create a Phase Three Concept Area; (2)
12 Specific Plan/Zone Map Amendment No. 18-049, to remove the Project from the East Valley
13 Corridor Specific Plan and change the zoning to Planned Community and Institutional-Health
14 Care (I-HC), and from Single Family Residential (R-1) to Planned Community; (3) Zone Map
15 Change/Amendment No. 17-193, to adopt The Groves at Loma Linda Specific Plan and amend
16 Chapter 17.44 of the City of Loma Linda Municipal Code to establish The Groves Specific
17 Plan as a Special Purpose Designation; and (4) Zone Map/Amendment Change No. 18-050 to
18 amend the Citrus Trails Master Plan/Planned Development Permit No. 15-087.

19 2. Petitioners Paul Marchese and the Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters
20 (collectively, "Petitioners") challenge the approval of the Project on the grounds that the

21 Project does not comply with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA-Pub.
22 Resources Code § 21000 et seq.) because, inter alia, the EIR lacks an accurate and finite

23 project description, Respondents did not provide an adequate baseline or adequately disclose or
24 mitigate impacts for numerous categories of resources, Respondents applied improper
25 greenhouse gas thresholds, the EIR provided a faulty cumulative impacts analysis, and
26 Respondents erroneously determined the Project would not significantly impact the hydrology
27 of the Project site. Respondents' certification of the EIR and approval of the Project

28 constitutes an abuse of discretion and must be reversed.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
2

1 II. PARTIES

2 3. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 2 as if fully set

3 forth herein.

4 4. Paul Marchese is a taxpayer and resident of the City of Loma Linda, where the
5 Project is located.

6 5. Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters is a labor union representing 50,000
7 union carpenters in six states, including in southern California, and has a strong interest in

8 addressing the environmental impacts of development projects, such as the Project. Members
of Petitioner Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters reside in the City of Loma Linda and
10 in the County of San Bernardino, and include residents affected by the Project, whose interests
11 will be adversely affected by the violations of CEQA and approval of the Project. Southwest
12 Regional Council of Carpenters submitted comments on the Project that addressed the

13 inadequacies of Respondents' environmental review.
14 6. Respondent City of Loma Linda, acting through Respondent City Council of the

15 City of Loma Linda, is a charter city in the County of San Bernardino. On June 12, 2018,
16 Respondents adopted a resolution in which they certified the EIR and Respondents also
17 approved a series of other resolutions and ordinances to approve the Project during their June

18 12, 2018 and June 26, 2018 meetings. On July 2, 2018, Respondents filed a Notice of
19 Determination with the County Clerk of the County of San Bernardino. Respondents' Notice
20 of Determination identified Respondent City of Loma Linda as the Project applicant and Real

21 Party in Interest.

22 7. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, or otherwise, of
23 Does 1 through 30, are unknown to Petitioners who therefore sue said Respondents by such
24 fictitious names and will seek leave to amend this Petition for Writ of Mandamus when their
25 identities have been ascertained.

26 8. Petitioners are informed and believe that at all times herein alleged,
27 Respondents and each of them were the agents and employees of each of the remaining

28 Respondents and while doing the things herein alleged, were acting within the course and

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
3

scope of such agency and employment.

2 IIF. STANDING

3 9. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 8 as if fully set

4 forth herein.

5 10. Approval of the Project will adversely affect the interests of Petitioner Paul

6 Marchese. Petitioner Paul Marchese is an individual dedicated to the protection of the

7 environment in the City of Loma Linda and in the County of San Bernardino by participating®

8 in local environmental and land use policy and decision making. Petitioner Paul Marchese is a

9 resident of the City of Loma Linda and County of San Bernardino and is affected by the
10 Project, and whose interests in preservation of the environmental integrity of the City and
11 County will be adversely affected by the lack of proper environmental review under CEQA
12 and approval of the Project. Petitioner Paul Marchese is also a member of Petitioner

13 Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters. Petitioner is an "aggrieved person" within the

14 meaning of Public Resources Code § 21177.

15 11. Approval of the Project will adversely affect the interests of Petitioner

16 Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters and its members. Said organization is a labor union

17 that is dedicated to also preserving the environment for its members, including those in the
18 County of San Bernardino. Approval of the Project and certification of the EIR will adversely

19 affect these interests of Petitioner Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters and its members.

20 Members or representatives of Petitioner Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters, on behalf
21 thereof, have submitted comments on and objections to the lack of CEQA compliance during
22 the administrative proceedings where the Project was considered. Accordingly, Petitioner

23 Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters is an "aggrieved person" within the meaning of

24 Public Resources Code § 21177. The claims asserted and relief requested are broad-based, so
25 that participation in the litigation by individual members is not required.

26 IV. EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

27 12. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 11 as if fully
28 set forth herein.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
4

1 13. Petitioners have performed all conditions precedent to the filing of this Petition

2 by themselves or others, raising each and every issue known to them before Respondents, in

3 compliance with Public Resources Code § 21177, Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085 and

4 1094.5, and other applicable law.

5 14. Notice of the filing of this action as required by Public Resources Code §
6 21167.5 was mailed to Respondents on July 30, 2018. (Letter and Proof of Service are

7 attached hereto as Exhibit "A".)

8 V. JURISDICTION

9 15. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully

10 set forth herein.

11 16. Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to Public Resources Code § 21000
12 et seq., including Public Resources Code §§ 21167, 21168 and 21168.5; 14 Cal. Code Regs. con
13 15122 (hereinafter "CEQA Guidelines"), and Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085 and 1094.5, the
14 Constitution of the State of California, the Constitution of the United States, and all other

15 applicable laws.

16 VI. FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

17 Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act [Public Resources Code 21000 et seq.]
18 17. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 16 as if fully
19 set forth herein.
20 18. Respondents' approval of the EIR constitutes an abuse of discretion because,
21 inter alia, the EIR lacks an accurate and finite project description, Respondents did not provide
22 an adequate baseline or adequately disclose or mitigate impacts to environmental resources,
23 Respondents applied improper greenhouse gas thresholds, the EIR provided a faulty
24 cumulative impacts analysis, and Respondents erroneously determined the Project would not
25 significantly impact the hydrology of the Project site. Furthermore, Respondents failed to
26 adequately respond to comments in the EIR. The responses were incomplete, unresponsive, or
27 deferred analysis. The evaluation and response to public comments must contain good faith,
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
5

1 reasoned analysis. CEQA Guidelines § 15088(b). Thus, Respondents' failure to properly

2 respond to comments on the EIR further constitutes a failure to proceed in a manner required

3 by law.

4 19. "An accurate, stable and finite project description is the sine qua non of an

5 informative and legally sufficient EIR." County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 710

6 Cal.App.3d 185. "Project" is defined as "the whole of the action, which has the potential for

7 resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable

8 indirect physical change in the environment . . .." CEQA Guidelines § 15378(a). The EIR

9 fails to provide an accurate and finite project description. For instance, the EIR fails to

10 adequately describe the whole of Respondents' action, instead unduly focusing on

11 development that will occur on one-third of the Project site and provides limited to no

12 description of development slated to occur on the remaining two-thirds of the Project site.

13 20. An EIR must "include a description of the physical environmental conditions in
14 the vicinity of the project, as they exist at the time the notice of preparation is published."

15 CEQA Guidelines § 15125(a). The City did not adequately evaluate, disclose, or describe

16 baseline environmental conditions in regard to a variety of resource categories, including air

17 quality, greenhouse gases, biological resources, hazards and hazardous materials, and utilities.

18 Further, Respondents focused primarily on one-third of the Project site and failed to adequately

19 evaluate, disclose, or describe existing environmental conditions across the remainder of the

20 Project site.

21 21. CEQA requires Respondents to disclose the environmental impacts of the

22 Project and to adopt all feasible mitigation. Pub. Resources Code § 21002; CEQA Guidelines

23 15126. Respondents failed to adequately disclose or mitigate the Project's impacts relating

24 to, inter alia, aesthetic resources, agricultural resources, air quality, biological resources,

25 historical resources, hazards and hazardous materials, and hydrology and water quality. In

26 addition, the EIR failed to disclose the full breadth of Project impacts, instead primarily

27 focusing on impacts that would occur on one-third of the Project site. Respondents failed to

28 adopt all feasible mitigation or otherwise illegally deferred formulation of mitigation measures

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
6

1 that would have avoided or reduced impacts to the above and other environmental resources.

22. Respondents improperly relied on thresholds of significance they have not

3 themselves adopted. California law requires Respondents to determine the Project's
contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. CEQA Guidelines allow an agency to determine the
significance of Project-level greenhouse gas impacts, for instance, by setting quantitative
emissions thresholds and by determining consistency with a Climate Action Plan, consisting of
7 regulations "adopted by the relevant public agency through a public review process." CEQA

8 Guidelines § 15064.4(b). To be relied on as mitigation, this plan must actively "reduce or
9 mitigate the project's incremental contribution of greenhouse gas emissions." CEQA
10 Guidelines § 15064.4(b).

11 23. In their EIR, Respondents evaluate the consistency of the Project with, inter
12 alia, the California Air Resources Board's AB 32 Scoping Plan (Scoping Plan) to conclude

13 Project-level impacts under this significance threshold are less than significant prior to

14 mitigation. The Scoping Plan is a statewide plan designed to reduce certain categories of
15 greenhouse gases consistent with the mandate of State greenhouse gas laws. However, Center
16 for Biological Diversity v. California Department of Fish and Wildlife (2015) 620 Cal.4th 204,
17 a recent landmark California Supreme Court decision directly on point on this issue, noted that
18 the Scoping Plan was not designed or intended to be used at the Project-level. This case held

19 that, to rely on the Scoping Plan, an agency, such as Respondents, must provide analysis that

20 adequately explains why application of the Scoping Plan at the Project-level would be suitable

21 under the circumstances. Respondents provided no such analysis and, thus, Respondents'

22 reliance on the Scoping Plan is erroneous. Respondents' reliance on this or any other plan not
23 adopted by Respondents is unlawful and erroneous. CEQA Guidelines § 15064.4(b). In

24 addition, Respondents' use of the Scoping Plan did not serve to "reduce or mitigate the

25 project's incremental contribution of greenhouse gas emissions," as required by law. CEQA

26 Guidelines § 15064.4(b). Accordingly, Respondents' significance determination as measured

27 against the Scoping Plan is without merit.

28 24. In addition, Respondents erroneously relied on the numeric threshold of 3,000

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
7

metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2e) formulated by the Southern California Air

2 Quality Management District (SCAQMD) for non-industrial stationary source greenhouse gas

3 emissions. Neither SCAQMD nor Respondents have adopted this numeric threshold, and
Respondents failed to justify the use of this threshold for both the Project's stationary and
5 mobile-source emissions. CEQA Guidelines § 15064.7. Thus, Respondents' use of this

6 numeric significance threshold is without merit.

7 25. Respondents failed to provide an adequate cumulative impacts analysis for,

8 inter alia, air quality and biological resources. CEQA requires Respondents to consider direct,

9 indirect, and cumulative impacts. Cumulative impacts include direct or indirect impacts
10 caused by the Project that may be less than significant at the Project-level but are significant
11 when considered in conjunction with other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future

12 development. CEQA Guidelines § 15355. Respondents failed to evaluate the impact of the
13 whole of Respondents' action in their cumulative impacts analysis. Thus, this analysis failed
14 to accurately represent the cumulative impacts of the Project combined with other past, present,
15 and reasonably foreseeable future projects.

16 26. Respondents' cumulative air quality impacts analysis only considered emissions
17 to be cumulatively significant if Respondents determined these emissions would surpass direct

18 and indirect Project-level significance thresholds. Thus, Respondents failed to proceed in a

19 manner required by law in failing to consider impacts resulting from "individually minor but
20 collectively significant projects," as required by CEQA. CEQA Guidelines § 15355(b).
21 27. Respondents failed to adequately consider cumulative impacts to biological

22 resources. Respondents erroneously concluded, without evidence, that compliance with state

23 and local laws would negate any potential of cumulative impacts to occur to biological

24 resources. Respondents provided no evidence that would support the City's conclusion that the

25 Project would cause cumulatively less than significant impacts to biological resources.
26 Respondents' failure to adequately evaluate these cumulative impacts violates CEQA.

27 28. Respondents' conclusion that the Project would not significantly impact
28 hydrology and water quality is not supported by evidence. Respondents failed to support their

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
8

conclusion that the Project, which would add hundreds of acres of impervious surfaces to what

2 is currently agricultural land, would not significantly alter the hydrology of the Project site.
29. Due to all the above flaws, Respondents' actions constitute an abuse of

4 discretion. Respondents must prepare an adequate EIR that conforms with all of the procedural

5 and substantive requirements set forth under CEQA. Approval of the Project EIR, which

6 lacked both procedural and substantive requirements under CEQA, constitutes an abuse of

7 discretion.

8 VII. ATTORNEYS' FEES

30. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 29 as if fully
10 set forth herein.

11 31. In pursuing this action, Petitioners will confer a substantial benefit on the People
12 of the State of California and therefore are entitled to recover from Respondents reasonable
13 attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure § 1021.5, and other
14 provisions of the law.

15 VIII. INJUNCTION

16 32. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 31 as if fully
17 set forth herein.

18 33. An actual controversy has arisen concerning Respondents' failure to comply
19 with CEQA (Pub. Resources Code § 21000 et seq.), as set forth above.

20 34. As a result of the above-alleged violations of CEQA, Respondents have failed to
21 conduct adequate environmental review as required by law and, thus, have failed to proceed in

22 a manner required by law in approving the Project.

23 35. At all times mentioned herein, Respondents have been able to comply with
24 CEQA, prepare adequate environmental review, and comply with all relevant provisions of
25 law. Notwithstanding such ability, Respondents have failed and continue to fail to perform

26 their duty to comply with CEQA.
27 36. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that Respondents
28 are threatening to proceed with development of the Project in the near future. Said

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
9

implementation of the Project will irreparably harm the environment and will result in

2 significant and unmitigated adverse environmental impacts.

3 37. Petitioners possess no speedy, adequate remedy at law, in that implementation

4 and development in connection with the Project will permanently and forever harm, injure,

5 degrade, and impact the environmental values of the City of Loma Linda, the County of San
6 Bernardino and the State of California. Petitioners will suffer irreparable and permanent

7 injuries if Respondents' actions described herein are not set aside.

8 38. A stay and/or restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunction

9 should issue restraining Respondents from procceding with development of the Project.
10 39. In order to preserve the status quo, a stay and/or restraining order and

11 preliminary and permanent injunction should issue staying Respondents' approval of the
12 Project and certification of the EIR.

13 PRAYER

14 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as follows:
15 1. For Alternative and Peremptory Writs of Mandate ordering Respondents to set
16 aside any and all Project approvals including, but not limited to, General Plan Amendment No.
17 18-048; Specific Plan/Zone Map Amendment No. 18-049; Zone Map Change/Amendment No.
18 17-193; and Zone Map/Amendment Change No. 18-050, as reflected in Resolution Nos. 2979
19 and 2980 and Ordinance Nos. 747, 748, and 749, and certification and approval of the EIR for
20 the Project, unless and until Respondents take all necessary steps to bring their actions into

21 compliance with CEQA.

22 2. For an order staying Respondents or other Project applicants from engaging in
23 any activity pursuant to the Project until the environmental review and the Project complies

24 with California statutes and regulations, including but not limited to the requirements of

25 CEQA;

26 3. For reasonable attorneys' fees, pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure !

27 1021.5, and other provisions of the law;

28 4. For costs of suit; and

RE: Notice of Intent to Commence Litigation
Pursuant to the requirements of Public Resources Code Section 21167.5, this letter will serve as notice that Paul Marchese and Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters will commence litigation against the City of Loma Linda ("City").
The litigation challenges the actions of the City to approve Specific Planning Area "D" (*The Groves at Loma Linda"), including approval of (1) General Plan Amendment No. 18-048, to create a Phase Three Concept Area; (2) Specific Plan/Zone Map Amendment No. 18-049, to remove the Project from the East Valley Corridor Specific Plan and change the zoning to Planned Community and Institutional-Health Care (I-HC), and from Single Family Residential (R-1) to Planned Community; (3) Zone Map Change/Amendment No. 17-193, to adopt The Groves at Loma Linda Specific Plan and amend Chapter 17.44 of the City of Loma Linda Municipal Code to establish The Groves Specific Plan as 1 Special Purpose Designation; and (4) Zone Map/Amendment Change No. 18-050 to amend the Citrus Trails Master Plan/Planned Development Permit No. 15-087. The City identified itself in its Notice of Determination as the entity carrying out the Project.
The litigation has been commenced because the actions listed in the preceding paragraph do not comply with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.).
