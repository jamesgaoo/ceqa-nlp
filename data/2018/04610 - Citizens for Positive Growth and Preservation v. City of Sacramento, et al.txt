19 Plaintiff and Petitioner CITIZENS FOR POSITIVE GROWTH & PRESERVATION
20 ("CPGP") complains and alleges as follows:

21 1. On or about April 19, 2018, the City of Sacramento and the City Council of the
22 City of Sacramento (collectively, the "City" or "Respondents") violated the California
23 Environmental Quality Act ("CBQA") and sought to circumvent a peremptory writ of mandate

24 (the "Peremptory Writ") issued by the Superior Court of the State of California, County of
25 Sacramento (the "Court"), when the City approved the Central City Specific Plan ("CCSP') and
26 adopted Ordinance No. 2018-0014. The City's unlawful actions altered the boundaries of the
27 Alhambra Special Planning District ("Alhambra SPD") by effectively reolassifying portions of the
28 Alhambra SPD-which enjoy certain protections intended to "[m]aintain and improve the

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 character, quality, and vitality" of the neighborhoods within its boundaries-to be subject to the

2 CCSP, which does not provide the same protections.

3 2. The City's first attempt to alter the boundaries of the Alhambra SPD without

4 conducting the environmental review required by CEQA was declared unlawful by the Court on

5 January 30, 2018, in the action captioned Citizens For Positive Growth & Preservation v. City of

6 Sacramento, et al., Case No. 30-2016-80002475 (the "2016 Action"). In the 2016 Action, the
7 Court held that the City abused its discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law

8 by adopting two ordinances (the "2016 Ordinances") that modified the Alhambra SPD by, among
9 lother things, moving its western boundary from 26th Street to 29th Street. By removing these
10 three blocks from the Alhambra SPD, the 2016 Ordinances enabled development between 26th

11 Street and 29th Street to exceed the Alhambra SPD's height restrictions, which prohibit the

12 construction of buildings taller than 35 feet within 300 feet of residential zones.

13 3. The Court concluded, in the 2016 Action, that the City acted unlawfully by
14 determining that the 2016 Ordinances did not constitute a "project," as defined by CEQA, and by
15 failing to subject the Ordinances to environmental review. As the Court explained, the 2016
16 Ordinances qualified as a CBQA project because they "were intended to allow for higher infill
17 development" in the Alhambra SPD," and it is "logical that such development will result in
18 reasonably foresceable indirect physical changes to the environment, such as effects related to
19 traffic conditions, air quality, noise, and sewer and water resources." Accordingly, this Court
20 issued the Peremptory Writ commanding the City to immediately rescind the 2016 Ordinances,
21 which were adopted in violation of CEQA, and to cease any activity in furtherance thereof.

22 4. In March 2018, the City rescinded the 2016 Ordinances. However, in April 2018,
23 the City adopted Ordinance No. 2018-0014-which again moved the western boundary of the
24 Alhambra SPD from 26th Street to 29th Street-this time as part of the City's vote to approve the
25 CCSP, which governs the geographic area that is adjacent (and to the west of) the Alhambra SPD.

26 5. The City violated CEQA and the Peremptory Writ by approving the CCSP and
27 adopting Ordinance No. 2018-0014 because the environmental impact report ("EIR") for the
28 CCSP did not study the environmental impacts of shrinking the boundaries of the Alhambra SPD

2 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 by three blocks. Instead, the City prepared and circulated for public comment the CCSP EIR
2 months before this Court issued the Peremptory Writ, and while the 2016 Ordinances were still in
3 effect. Therefore, the CCSP EIR assumed that the western boundary of the Alhambra SPD had
4 already lawfully been moved from 26th Street to 29th Street by the adoption of the 2016
5 Ordinances, and that the area between 26th Street and 29th Street was not part of the Alhambra

6 SPD, but was instead part of the adjacent CCSP project area. Accordingly, the EIR assumed that
7 the Alhambra SPD regulations did not apply to any land within the CCSP project area, and that no
8 related height restrictions (or the elimination thereof) needed to be analyzed as part of the

9 approval of the CCSP. Based on this foundational assumption, the City conducted no study of the
10 impacts of removing the area between 26th Street and 29th Street from the Alhambra SPD. Nor
11 did the public have any opportunity (or reason) to comment on that change, or the impacts
12 resulting therefrom, during the comment period on the CCSP EIR.

13 6. When this Court concluded, in the 2016 Action, that the 2016 Ordinances were
14 unlawfully adopted in violation of CEQA, this foundational premise of the CCSP EIR was

15 rendered false. Nevertheless, without revising the CCSP EIR to analyze the impacts of moving
16 the western boundary of the Alhambra SPD from 26th Street to 29th Street, and without
17 recirculating the CCSP EIR for public review and comment, the City Council voted to approve
18 the CCSP and to adopt Ordinance No. 2018-0014. The City thus violated CEQA by modifying
19 the boundaries of the Alhambra SPD for the second time without studying the environmental
20 impacts that are likely--if not certainly.to be caused by shrinking the footprint of the Alhambra
21 SPD. Accordingly, a peremptory writ should issue commanding the City to set aside its approval
22 of the CCSP, and to rescind Ordinance No. 2018-0014.

23 THE PARTIES

24 7. Petitioner and Plaintiff CPGP is, and at all relevant times was, an unincorporated
25 association whose members reside in or around the City of Sacramento. CPGP was created to
26 advocate for positive growth in the City, and the preservation of safe, healthy, and livable
27 residential neighborhoods throughout the City. The interests of CPGP are, and will continue to be,
28 adversely affocted and injured by Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA by approving the
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 CCSP without studying the environmental impacts that may result from shrinking the boundaries
2 of the Alhambra SPD, including but not limited to impacts on traffic conditions, congestion, air
3 quality, greenhouse gas emissions, noise, parking, sewer and water resources, aesthetics, light, and

4 glare.

8. Respondent City of Sacramento is, and at all times herein mentioned was, 8
6 municipal corporation located in Sacramento County, California, and created under the laws of the
7 State of California.

9. Respondent City Council of the City of Sacramento ("City Council") is, and at all
times herein mentioned was, the duly-elected legislative body of the City of Sacramento.

10 10. CPGP is ignorant of the true names and capacities of respondents and defendants

11 sued herein as DOES 1 through 100, inclusive, and, therefore, sues said respondents and
12 defendants by such fictitious names. CPGP will amend this petition to allege their true names and
13 capacities when ascertained. CPGP is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that each of the
14 fictitiously named respondents and defendants are responsible in some manner for the acts alleged
15 herein and/or will be directly impacted by the relief sought by CPGP in this matter.

16 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

17 11. This Court has jurisdiction to review actions of the Respondents under California

18 Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5, and to issue a peremptory a writ of mandate
19 under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5.

20 12. Venue is proper in this Court under Code of Civil Procedure section 394(a) because
21 Respondents are located within the County of Sacramento.

22 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

23 13. The Alhambra Corridor SPD was adopted in 1992, and included the area bordered
24  by 26th and 34th streets from the Southern Pacific railroad mainline levee to the W/X Freeway.

25 14. The intent of the Alhambra SPD, as codified in Section 17.420.010 of the
26 Sacramento City Code, is "to assist in the preservation of the neighborhood scale and character,
27 along with providing additional housing opportunities in the area." Among the goals of the

28 Alhambra SPD are to "[m]aintain and improve the character, quality, and vitality of individual

4 VERIFIED PETITION FOR. WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- neighborhoods," and to "[m]aintain the diverse character and housing opportunities provided in
2 these urban neighborhoods."

3 15. Section 17.420.020 of the Sacramento City Code imposes certain special

4 regulations and restrictions governing development within the SPD. Among other things, Section
5 17.420.020 provides that, with certain exceptions, "development located within 300 feet of a

6 residential zone (measured from the street centerline) shall not exceed 35 feet in height. This
7 restriction is intended to establish a residential preservation transition buffer zone to protect
8 residential neighborhoods from visual intrusion by new development that is out of scale with the
9 adjacent residential neighborhood."

10 16, In September 2016, City Council staff proposed modifications to the Alhambra

11 SPD "in order to remove regulatory barriers that could inhibit housing development in the project
12 area." Staff reported that the modifications would (i) shrink the footprint of the Alhambra SPD by
13 adjusting the western boundary from 26th to 29th Streets; and (ii) remove the SPD height
14 restrictions for properties located between 30th Street and Alhambra Boulevard from I to N
15 Streets.

16 17. On September 27, 2016, the City Council passed the 2016 Ordinances, which
17 included (i) Ordinance No. 2016-0041, as amended amending Sections 17.420.010 and 17.420.020
18 of the Sacramento City Code relating to the Alhambra Corridor SPD; and (ii) Ordinance No.
19 2016-0042 amending Title 17 of the Sacramento City Code to rezone various parcels located.
20 within the Alhambra Corridor SPD.

21 18. Specifically, Ordinance No. 2016-0041 amended Section 17.420.010 of the
22 Sacramento City Code by moving the western border of the Alhambra SPD from 26th Street to
23 29th Street, thereby shrinking the boundaries of the SPD by three blocks. In addition, Ordinance
24 No. 2016-0041 amended Section 17.420.020 of the Sacramento City Code by, among other things,
25  excluding from the Alhambra SPD height restrictions of 35 feet development located within the

26 area bounded by J Street to the north, Alhambra Boulevard to the east, N Street to the south, and

27 30th Street to the west.

28  ///

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 19. Similarly, Ordinance No. 2016-0042 amended Title 17 of the Sacramento City
2 Code to rezone the properties from 26th Street to 29th Street, between the Southern Pacific
3 Railroad Levee and Highway 50, so as to exclude them from the Alhambra SPD.

4 20. In sum, the 2016 Ordinances as passed operated to (i) narrow the geographic area
5 included in the Alhambra SPD, and (ii) exclude certain parcels located within the Alhambra SPD
from the height restrictions imposed by the Sacramento City Code governing the SPD.

21. The day after the City Council passed the 2016 Ordinances, on September 28,
8 2016, the City of Sacramento submitted to the County Clerk for the County of Sacramento a
Notice of Exemption concerning the Alhambra Corridor Special Planning District (SPD)
10 Modifications (LR16-009)--i.c., the 2016 Ordinances passed at the September 27, 2016 City
11 Council Meeting,

12 22. The Notice of Exemption described the project as follows:

13 The project consists of modifying the Alhambra Corridor SPD by

14 shrinking the footprint by adjusting the western boundary and rezoning various parcels from 26th Street to 29th Street, and removing the SPD

15 height restrictions for properties located between 30th Street and the Alhambra Blvd. from J to N Streets. The height standards and

16 regulations of the applicable base zone shall apply for this area. These changes result in a smaller footprint for the Alhambra Corridor SPD that will help remove barriers to infill development by streamlining and
17 increasing predictability for development projects. Additionally, these

18 changes will allow development by streamlining and increasing predictability for development projects. Additionally, these changes will

19 allow development in the Central City to occur in a more consistent urban development pattern as identified in the 2035 General Plan, Downtown Housing Initiative, Central City Neighborhood Design Guidelines, and the
20 Planning and Development Code (Title 17 of the Sacramento City Code).
21 Notice of Exemption (emphasis added).

22 23. The Notice of Exemption went on to state that the City of Sacramento found that
23 the 2016 Ordinances were exempt from CEQA reyiew because the "[a]ctivity is not a project as
24 defined in Section 15378 [Section 15060(c)(3)]." The City concluded that the project is not

25 subject to CEQA review because:
26 The project consists of an administrative action that will not result in direct or indirect physical changes in the environment, and the action is
27 not a project that requires environmental review under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (CEQA Guidelines Section
28 15378(b)(5) and 15060(c)(3),. Any future proposed development is subject

6 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

to the review requirements established in the Planning and Development Code, including CEQA review as appropriate.
2

3 24. On November 2, 2016, CPGP commenced the 2016 Action by filing a Verified

4 Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief, by which CPGP challenged
5 the City's adoption of the 2016 Ordinances. In the Petition and in its briefing thereon, CPGP
6 argued, among other things, that the City violated CEQA by adopting the 2016 Ordinances

7 without subjecting them to environmental review. Specifically, CPGP argued that the City's
8  determination that the 2016 Ordinances did not qualify as a project under CEQA was contrary to
law, as the 2016 Ordinances, if allowed to stand, were virtually certain to cause substantial
10 environmental impacts for persons who live, work, attend school, and travel through the Alhambra
11 SPD. Indeed, the impacts of the amendments at issue-which rezoned certain segments of the
12 Alhambra SPD and thereby enabled development of properties excecding the existing SPD height
13 restriction of 35 feet-included potential impacts relating to traffic conditions, congestion, air
14 quality, greenhouse gas emissions, noise, parking, sewer and water resources, aesthetics, light, and
15 glare.

16 25. On January 12, 2018, a hearing on the Petition was held in this Court before the
17 Honorable Michael P. Kenny. On January 30, 2018, this Court entered an order granting in part
18 and denying in part CPGP's Petition (the "Order"), and a Judgment granting in part and denying in
19 part CPGP's Potition (the "Judgment"). The Order and Judgment adopted the Court's tentative
20 ruling on the Petition, in which the Court concluded, in part, as follows:
21 The Ordinances are more than a "process" change. Prior to adoption of the

22 Ordinances, any development within the SPD and within 300 feet of a residential zone could not exceed 35 feet without the Planning and Design Commission's

23 approval of a conditional use permit ("CUP") based upon a finding "that the development would not be out of scale with the adjacent residential
24 neighborhood." (AR 49.). By adopting the Ordinances, certain parcels of property were effectively rezoned, permitting development over 35 feet without
25 the issuance of a CUP. Accordingly, the Court finds the Ordinances amount to a

26 substantive change to the SPD's requirements -- they effectively remove the 35- foot height restriction from certain parcels.
27

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 Moreover, the Court finds this change has "a potential for resulting in ....a

2 reasonably foresecable indirect physical change in the environment." (Cal, Code Regs., tit. 14 15378(a).). The Ordinances were intended to allow for higher infill

3 development…It is logical that such development will result in reasonably foresecable indirect physical changes to the environment, such as effects related
4 to traffic conditions, air quality, noise, and sewer and water resources..For the stated reasons, the Court finds the Ordinances are "projects" under CEQA.
5 Accordingly, Petitioner has shown Respondents abused their discretion in

6 adopting the Ordinances by failing to proceed in the manner required by law, (Emphasis added.)

7 26. Also on January 30, 2018, this Court issued the Peremptory Writ commanding the

8 City to rescind and set aside the 2016 Ordinances, to cease any activity in furtherance thereof, and
9  to file a return to the peremptory writ within 60 days of its service.

10 27. On April 9, 2018, the City filed its Return and reported that the City had rescinded

11 the 2016 Ordinances. The City went on to address the Court's directive that the City take such
12 action as may be necessary to comply with CEQA, as follows:
13 With respect to the Court's directive that the City take any such action as may be

14 necessary to comply with CEQA's requirements, the City staff proposes to recommend to the City Council that, rather than reconsider the above-referenced rescinded Ordinances, to address any potential changes as part of a proposal for a
15 new Specific Plan, and its related regulatory changes, for the Central City area.

16 This could include moving the western boundary of the Alhambra Corridor SPD from 26th Street to 29th Street. This action, if it occurred, would occur

17 concurrent with a proposed adoption of a Central City Specific Plan and would result in rezone of all areas within the proposed Central City Special Planning

18 District, including the area between 26th and 29th streets, to proposed Central City special planning district zoning designations. Such changes, if proposed,
19 would be analyzed in the Environmental Impact Report for the Central City Specific Plan. (Emphasis added.)

20 28. The City's representation that proposal to shrink the Alhambra SPD "would be
21 analyzed in the Environmental Impact Report for the Central City Specific Plan" was false and
22 misleading. In fact, the draft EIR for the CCSP had been completed and circulated more than six
23  months carlier, on September 22, 2017, for a 45-day public review period that expired on or about
24 November 8, 2017. The draft EIR did not study the potential impacts of shifting the western
25 boundary of the Alhambra SPD from 26th Street to 29th Street. Rather, because Ordinance No.
26 2016-0041 had elready been unlawfully adopted (and had not yet been rescinded pursuant to this
27 Court's Peremptory Writ), the draft EIR assumed that the western boundary of the Alhambra SPD

28 was 29th Street. No study of the impact of moving that boundary from 26th Street to 29th Street

8 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 Was undertaken. Nor did the public have any opportunity (or reason) to comment on that change

2 o1 the impacts resulting therefrom.

3 29. It was not until approximately February 2018, when the City released the final EIR

4 for the CCSP that the City proposed, for the first time, to adopt an ordinance that would move the
5 western boundary of the Alhambra SPD as part of the CCSP vote. Like the draft EIR, the final

6 EIR did not analyze the potential impacts of shrinking the footprint of the Alhambra SPD.
7 Instead, the final EIR simply concluded that "the analysis in the Draft EIR considers the effects of
8 the project compared to a baseline that reflects the existing conditions in the plan area," and that,

9 as a result, "the change in maximum allowable heights…does not affect or alter the environmental
10 impact" described in the draft EIR.

11 30. On April 19, 2018, CPGP submitted a written objection to the City's proposal to
12 adopt the CCSP, including the proposed ordiñance that would modify the Alhambra SPD. In that
13 objection, CPGP advised the City, in part, as follows:

14 The City's proposal to adopt this ordinance as part of the Central City Specific

15 Plan evidences a clear attempt to circumvent the judgment and Peremptory Writ issued by the Superior Court, and the mandates of CEQA. Indeed, because the
16 Superior Court determined that an ordinance shrinking the boundaries of the Alhambra SPD constitutes a "project" subject to CEQA review, before re-
17 adopting such an ordinance, CEQA requires the City to determine whether an EIR must be prepared, or whether a negative declaration is appropriate. If there is
18 substantial evidence that the ordinance may have a significant effect on the

19 environment, the City must prepare an EIR to study the environmental impacts that may result from the ordinance. If there is no substantial evidence that the
20 ordinance may have such an environmental effect, the City may instead prepare a negative declaration. See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15063.
21 The City did neither. Instead, well after the close of the public comment period
22 for the DEIR for the Central City Specific Plan, the City issued the FEIR and

23 proposed---for the first time-to adopt e new ordinance modifying the boundaries of the Alhambra SPD as part of the vote on the Central City Specific Plan. The
24 City's proposal is improper because, as discussed below, neither the DEIR nor the FEIR for the Central City Specific Plan considers or analyzes the potential
25 environmental impacts that may result from an ordinance that shrinks the boundaries of the Alhambra SPD by three blocks.
26

27

28 ///

C VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

31. CPGP went on to explain aS follows:

2 [T]he DEIR's analysis was based on the flawed assumption that the western

3 boundary of the Alhambra SPD had already lawfully been moved from 26th Street to 29th Street by the adoption of Ordinance No. 2016-0041. Thus, the DEIR assumed that the Alhambra SPD regulations did not apply to any land within the Central City Specific Plan area, and that no related height restrictions (or the elimination thereof) needed to be analyzed. Because the Superior Court

6 concluded that Ordinance No. 2016-0041 was unlawfully adopted in violation of CEQA, that foundational premise of the DEIR was false. (Emphasis in original.)

8 32. Finally, CPGP objected to the City's adoption of the CCSP without revising and
9 recirculating the EIR for the project:

10 In addition, the City also violated CEQA by failing to revise and then recirculate

11 the Central City Specific Plan EIR for publio review and comment in light of significant new information, namely, the Superior Court's judgment and

12 Peremptory Writ, and the subsequent proposal of a new ordinance modifying the boundaries of the Alhambra SPD. See 14 CCR 15088.5 (requiring recirculation of an EIR "when significant new information is added to the EIR after public
13 notice is given of the availability of the draft EIR. for public review under Section

14 15087 but before certification"). By failing to recirculate the EIR, the City has deprived the public and responsible agencies of an opportunity to review and comment upon the substantial changes to the EIR, including the proposed change
15 to the western boundary of the Alhambra SPD, and the impact of those changes
upon the environment.
16

17 33. Also on April 19, 2018, over CPGP's objection, the City Council voted to approve

18 the CCSP. Included in that vote was the adoption of Ordinance No. 2018-0014, which shrinks the
19 Alhambra SPD by moving its western boundary from 26th Street to 29th Street.

20 34. On April 20, 2018, the City filed a Notice of Determination advising that the City
21 Council had approved the CCSP on April 19, 2018.

22 35. Because the City adopted the CCSP, including Ordinance No. 2018-0014, without
23 studying the impacts of shrinking the boundary of the Alhambra SPD by three blocks, the City
24 failed to comply with CEQA and improperly attempted to circumvent the judgment and
25 | Peremptory Writ issued by the Court in the 2016 Action.

1 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Violation of CEQA: Deficient EIR)

3 [As Against All Respondents]

4 36. CPGP incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 35 as though fully set forth

5 herein,

6 37. Respondents violated CEQA by illegally and improperly approving the CCSP and
7 adopting Ordinance No. 2018-0014 without studying the environmental impacts that are likely, if

8 not certainly, to result from shrinking the boundaries of the Alhambra SPD by three blocks.

9 38. By eliminating the Alhambra SPD designation from 26th to 29th Strect, the City
a 10 created a condition in which significant changes in the density, land use intensity, and height of
11 buildings can occur. Indeed, the area between 26th Street and 29th Street is no longer subject to
12| any of the design guidelines and standards applicable under the Alhambra SPD, including the

13 Residential Preservation Transition Buffer Zone, which limits building heights.

14 39. Allowing increased density and intensity in the areas eliminated from the Alhambra

15 SPD will result in impacts to traffic conditions, congestion, air quality, greenhouse gas emissions,
16 noise, parking, sewer and water resources, aesthetics, light, and glare. All of these impacts must
17  be analyzed under CEQA.

18 40. The EIR for the CCSP does not analyze these impacts. Indeed, the City prepared
19 and circulated the CCSP while the 2016 Ordinances were still in effect, Therefore, the CCSP EIR
20 assumed that the western boundary of the Alhambra SPD had already lawfully been moved from
21 26th Street to 29th Street by the adoption of the 2016 Ordinances, and that the area between 26th

22 Street and 29th Street was not part of the Alhambra SPD, but was instead part of the adjacent
23 CCSP project area. Accordingly, the EIR assumed that the Alhambra SPD regulations did not
24 apply to any land within the CCSP project area, and that no related height restrictions (or the
25 elimination thereof) needed to be analyzed as part of the approval of the CCSP, The CCSP EIR
26 conducted no study of the impacts of removing the area between 26th Street and 29th Street from
27 the Alhambra SPD. Nor did the public have any opportunity (or reason) to comment on that
28 change, or the impacts resulting therefrom, during the comment period on the CCSP BIR.

11 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

41. By approving the CCSP and adopting Ordinance No. 2018-0014 without studying
its impacts in an EIR, Respondents violated CEQA and made it impossible to determine whether
the environmental impacts resulting from Ordinance No. 2018-0014 will be significant.

42. Therefore, the City abused its discretion and failed to proceed in the manner
required by law when it approved the CCSP and adopted Ordinance No. 2018-0014.

6 43. The CCSP and Ordinance No. 2018-0014 will irreparably harm CPGP and the
citizens of the City of Sacramento by, inter alia, allowing the City to approve projects that will

8 cause substantial environmental impacts without considering the significance of such impacts and
considering and imposing appropriate mitigation measures, and without giving the public and
10 responsible agencies a meaningful opportunity to comment on those impacts.

11 44. CPGP performed all of the conditions precedent to filing this action by sending a
12 written letter to Respondents objecting to the proposed activity prior to the close of the public
13  hearing on the City Council's approval of the CCSP and adoption of Ordinance No. 2018-0014.
14 CPGP is beneficially interested in the activity described herein. Accordingly, CPGP has
15 exhausted its administrative remedies and has standing to bring this action.

16 45. There is no appeal available from Respondents' determinations challenged herein.

17 CPGP has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy available, other than the relief sought in this
18 Petition and Complaint.

19 46. The issuance of a preemptory writ of mandate pursuant to the provisions of Public
20 Resources Code Sections 21167, 21168, and 21168.5, and Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1085
21 and 1094.5 is just and proper under the circumstances pled in this Verified Petition.

22 47. By this action, CPGP seeks to enforce an imporlant right affecting the public
23 interest in order to confer a significant benefit on the public as a whole by protecting the
24 environment of the City of Sacramento and enforcing the provisions of CEQA,

25 48. CPGP is incurring substantial expenses in attorneys' fees and costs in pursuing this
26 matter, all of which are within the jurisdictional limit of this Court. There is no monetary recovery

27 sought or allowed in this action that would be available to offset the expense of pursuing this
28 ///

12 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 action for CPGP. The necessity and financial burden of private enforcement is such as to make an
2 award of attorneys' fees in favor of CPGP appropriate.

3 49, CPGP is entitled to recover an award of attorneys' fees from Respondents under the

4 provisions of California Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.

5 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

6 (Violation of CEQA: Failure To Recirculate EIR)

7 [As Against All Respondents]

8 50. CPGP incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 49 as though fully set forth
9 herein.

10 51. Respondents violated CBQA by approving the CCSP without revising and

11 recirculating the CCSP EIR despite significant new information about the project that arose after

12 the close of the public comment period, namely, (i) the judgment entered in the 2016 Action and
13 the Peremptory Writ issued by the Court, (iil) the City's rescission of the 2016 Ordinances, and

14 (iil) the City's proposal to adopt an ordinance modifying the boundaries of the Alhambra SPD as

15 part of the CCSP vote.

16 52. CEQA requires recirculation of an EIR when "significant new information is added
17 to the EIR after public notice is given of the availability of the draft EIR for public review under
18 Section 15087 but before certification." 14 Cal. Code Regs. 40a 15088.5. "Significant new
19 information" requiring recirculation of an EIR includes, for example, a disclosure showing that "a
20 new significant environmental impact would result from the project," or that "a substantial

21 increase in the severity of an environmental impact would result unless mitigation measures are
22 adopted that reduce the impact to a level a of insignificance." This recirculation requirement is a
23 fundamental principle of CEQA, and failure to comply invalidates any resulting approval.

24 53. Following the close of the public comment period on the draft EIR for the CCSP,
25 the City added significant new information to the final EIR, namely, the City's plan to shrink the
26 boundaries of the Alhambra SPD by three blocks as part of the vote on the CCSP,

27 54. The City's proposal to shrink the boundaries of the Alhambra SPD constituted
28 significant new information that required the City to study the environmental impacts of that

13 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

change, to analyzo and propose mitigation measures, and to revise and recirculate the EIR.

2 Indeed, as the Court recognized in the 2016 Action, it is "logical" that modifying the boundaries

3 of the Alhambra SPD-and thereby enabling increased development in the area-"will result in
4 reasonably foresecable indirect physical changes to the environment, such as effects related to

5 traffic conditions, air quality, noise, and sewer and water resources."

6 55. The City's failure to recirculate the BIR constitutes a violation of CEQA and

7 invalidates the approval of the CCSP,

8 56. The CCSP will thereby irreparably harm CPGP and the citizens of the City of
Sacramento by, among other things, allowing the City to approve projects that will cause
10 substantial environmental impacts without considering the significance of such impacts and
11 considering and imposing appropriate mitigation measures, and without giving the public and
12 responsible agencies meaningful opportunity to comment on those impacts.

13 57. CPGP performed all of the conditions precedent to filing this action by sending a
14 written letter to Respondents objecting to the proposed activity prior to the close of the public
15 hearing on the City Council's approval of the CCSP and adoption of Ordinance No. 2018-0014.
16 CPGP is beneficially interested in the activity described herein, Accordingly, CPGP has
17 exhausted its administrative remedies and has standing to bring this action under State and local

18 planning law.

19 58. There is no appeal available from Respondents' determinations challenged herein.
20 CPGP has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy available, other than the relief sought in this
21 Petition and Complaint.

22 59. The issuance of a preemptory writ of mandate pursuant to, the provisions of Public
23 Resources Code Sections 21167, 21168, and 21168.5, and Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1085

24 and 1094.5 is just and proper under the circumstances pled in this Verified Petition,

25 60. By this action, CPGP seeks to enforce an important right affecting the public
26 interest in order to confer a significant benefit on the public as a whole by protecting the
27 l environment of the City of Sacramento and enforcing the provisions of CEQA.

28 61. CPGP is incurring substantial expenses in attorneys' fees and costs in pursuing this

14 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

matter, all of which are within the jurisdictional limit of this Court. There is no monetary recovery
2 sought or allowed in this action that would be available to offset the expense of pursuing this
action for CPGP. The necessity and financial burden of private enforcement is such as to make an
award of attorneys' fecs in favor of CPGP appropriate.

62. CPGP is entitled to recover an award of attorneys' fees from Respondents under the

6 provisions of California Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.

7 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

8 (Declaratory Relief)

9 [As Against All Respondents]

10 63. CPGP incorporates by reference paragraphs through 62 as though fully set forth
11 herein.

12 64. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between CPGP and Respondents
13 concerning their respective rights and duties. Specifically, CPGP contends that Respondents have
14 failed to comply with their obligations under CEQA by approving the CCSP and adopting
15 Ordinance No. 2018-0014, whereas Respondents contend that they have so complied.

16 65, CPGP desires a judicial declaration of its rights and duties, and a declaration as to
17 whether Respondents have complied with all of their obligations under CEQA.

18 66. A judicial declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time under the
19 circumstances to determine whether the City complied with CEQA by approving the CCSP and
20 adopting Ordinance No. 2018-0014.

21 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

22 WHEREFORE, CPGP prays for judgment against Respondents as follows:

23 1, On the First Cause of Action:

24 (ì) For a stay and a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents to:

25 a. Rescind, vacate, and set aside Respondents' certification of the CCSP EIR

26 and approval of the CCSP, including Ordinance No. 2018-0014 and each of

27 the project approvals; and

28 b. Refrain from taking any further actions in furtherance or implementation of in

4 the project.
