SECOND AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 1

Petitioner Palo Verde Irrigation District ("PVID" or "District"), alleges as follows:

2 INTRODUCTION

3 1. PVID brings this action under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA),

4 Public Resources Code sections 21000 et seq., to challenge Metropolitan Water District of
5 Southern California's (MWD) and the Board of Directors of Metropolitan Water District of
a Southern California's (MWD Board) determinations that six leases it approved and executed for
7 various parcels of farmland in Riverside and Imperial Counties were not "projects" subject to
g environmental review, or were otherwise exempt from CEQA. These leases, referred to herein as

9 the "Farm Leases," are "leases" of farmland which are thinly veiled attempts to turn these
10 agricultural parcels into "water farms" through stringent water consumption limitations and
NNNC Y SNOIINIS HOVWOS 11 extensive fallowing requirements.
uOgEIodIod [euoIssajoud V 12 2. The Farm Leases require farming entities leasing land from MWD within PVID's
13 service area to fallow and otherwise limit the use of Colorado River water on their parcels, all in
14 an effort to create additional water for urban use within MWD, whose direct rights to water are
15 otherwise junior to PVID. PVID has the senior water right, within California, to Colorado River
16 water. The Farm Leases individually and collectively have the potential to result in significant
17 environmental impacts, and thus are projects subject to CEQA.
18 3. The Farm Leases were approved by MWD with little discussion and no disclosure
19 to the public of the material terms of the Farm Leases or their potential adverse environmental
20 effects. Furthermore, neither MWD nor MWD Board members were forthcoming with details in
21 response to PVID's direct attempts to learn more about the leases before they were executed.
22 Instead, MWD kept all pertinent information about the Farm Leases "confidential," making only
23 conflicting, partial public information about the Farm Leases available.

24 4. MWD's failure to disclose and acknowledge the potentially significant adverse
25 environmental impacts of these Farm Leases -- particularly to agricultural resources, endangered
26 species, hydrology, and air quality - denied PVID and the local community important information
27 and the opportunity to make informed comments about the Farm Leases and the large-scale water
28 conservation and land fallowing program they implement. This includes depriving PVID and the

SECOND AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 2

1 local community of the opportunity to comment on the manner in which the water that might first
2 be used within PVID and the PVID community would be passed on to lower-priority water users
3 in more urban settings.

4 5. Because the Farm Leases fall squarely within CEQA's definition of a "project,"
5 MWD and the MWD Board violated CEQA when they determined that the Farm Leases were not
6 projects subject to CEQA review. PVID requests that this Court issue a writ of mandate setting
aside the Farm Leases and directing MWD to comply with all CEQA requirements, including
8 preparing and considering an environmental impact report (EIR) for these leases.
THE PARTIES

10 6. Petitioner PVID is, and at all relevant times has been, an irrigation district formed
& NNNC Y SNOIIAIS HOVWOS 11 under the Palo Verde Irrigation District Act of 1923 (Stats. 1923, ch. 452, Act. 770). PVID is A Professional uONBJOd.Ion 12 located within Imperial and Riverside Counties. PVID's boundaries include over 131,000 acres,
13 many of which are currently in agricultural production growing a range of feed and specialty
14 crops. The water used to irrigate lands within PVID comes from the Colorado River, and PVID
15 has first priority to use this water with respect to other California water districts.
16 7. Respondent MWD is, and at all relevant times has been, a metropolitan water
17 district formed under the Metropolitan Water District Act of 1969 (Stats. 1969, ch. 209, Act.
18 570). MWD is a regional water wholesäler made up of 26 member agencies located within Los
19 Angeles, Orange, Ventura, San Bernardino, Riverside, and San Diego counties. The wäter MWD
20 sells to its member agencies comes from both the Colorado River and California's State Water

21 Project. MWD's rights to Colorado River water are junior to those of PVID, Imperial Irrigation
22 District, and Coachella Valley Water District. MWD owns numerous parcels of farmland within
23 PVID's service area.

24 8. Respondent MWD Board is, and at all relevant times has been, the governing body
25 of Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and the entity that approved the Farm
26 Leases and adopted the determinations that the Farm Leases were exempt from CEQA.
27 9. PVID is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Real Party in Interest Cox
28 & Wegis Land Company, LLC (Cox & Wegis) is a limited liability company organized under

SECOND AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 3

2 California law (Corp. Code, §§ 17701.1 et seq.) and has its principal place of business in Blythe,

3 California. It has executed Farm Lease RL 4065 with MWD for properties within Riverside
County.

4 10.

t PVID is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Real Party in Interest

6 Joseph Albert Deconinck is an individual doing business as Joey Deconinck Farms (Deconinck),

7 and is located out of Blythe, California. Deconinck has executed Farm Lease RL 4066 with
MWD for properties in Riverside County.

8 11.

9 PVID is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Real Party in Interest

10 Desert Milling, Inc. (Desert Milling) is a California corporation with its principal place of

11 business in Brawley, California. It has executed Farm Lease RL 4064 with MWD for properties

uoperod.1o [euojssajord v SOMACH SIMMONS & DUNN E in Riverside County.

12 12.

13 PVID is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Real Party in Interest
Craig S. Elmore is an individual who is doing business as River
14 Valley Ranches (River Valley).

15 PVID is informed and believes that Mr. Elmore resides in Brawley, California. River Valley

16 executed Farm Lease RL 4063 with MWD for properties in Riverside and Imperial Counties.
13.

17 PVID is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Real Party in Interest

18 HayDay Farms Venture, LLC (HayDay Farms) is a limited liability company organized under

19 California law (Corp. Code, §§ 17701.1 et seq.), with its principal place of business in Blythe,

20 California. HayDay Farms has executed two of the six Farm Leases (RL 4061 and RL 4067) with
MWD for parcels in Riverside and Imperial Counties.
21 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

22 14.

23 This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure

24 sections 1085, 1094.5, and 1060, and Public Resources Code sections 21167, 21168, and

25 21168.5. Venue is proper in Riverside County under Code of Civil Procedure section 395

26 because Riverside County is where land owned by MWD that is subject to the Farm Leases is

27 located, where activities under the Farm Leases take place, and where their environmental
impacts will occur.

28

SECOND AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 4

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS -

2 15. MWD entered into six (6) Farm Leases with various farming entities for parcels
3 located within PVID's boundaries, consisting of 20,435 total irrigable acres. These include a
4 lease of 1,669 irrigable acres in Riverside County to Cox and Wegis (RL 4065), executed on
40.0 March 16, 2017; a lease of 564 irrigable acres in Riverside County to Deconinck (RL 4066),
executed on March 29, 2017; a lease of 3,582 irrigable acres in Riverside County to Desert
7 Milling (RL 4064), executed on March 29, 2017; lease of 7,248 irrigable acres in Riverside and
Imperial Counties to HayDay Farms (RL 4061), executed on December 28, 2016; a lease of 5,058 8

9 irrigable acres in Riverside County to HayDay (RL 4067), executed on April 24, 2017; and a
10 lease of 2,314 irrigable acres in Riverside and Imperial Counties to River Valley (RL 4063),
11 NNNO Y SNOWWIS HOVIOS executed on January 25, 2017.
uofe.1od.1o |euojssajora v 12 16. The Farm Leases purport to require the lessee to keep the land in agricultural
13 production during the lease term. However, up to half of the irrigable acreage within each lease is
14 subject a to a "fallowing call" by MWD, which would require that the lessee remove all vegetation
:15 including crops - from the acreage to be fallowed and cease all irrigation of those acres. The
16 lessee may voluntarily fallow more acres than those required by the MWD fallowing call, and
17 must also meet water conservation goals on the acres that are not fallowed.
18 17. Under the terms of the Farm Leases, upon a fallowing call by MWD, the lessee
19 must:
comply with its fallowing obligations under this Lease by clearing the 20 land of all vegetation, ceasing irrigation, and refraining from the following: (a) growing any agricultural crops or other vegetation on the 21 fallowed areas; (b) applying any water to the fallowed areas (other than rain that falls naturally on the fallowed areas); (c) extracting or applying 22 any groundwater on the fallowed areas; and (d) using or collecting any surface water on the fallowed areas, other than for dust control in 23 connection with required land management measures with [MWD's] prior written approval. *. 24
(Lease RL 4061, § 5.04.3) 25

26

27 The lease states that the lessee for RL 4067 is "HayDay Farms Ventures, is LLC," but PVID is informed and believes that the correct spelling of this entity's name is "HayDay Farms Venture, LLC."
28 2 Section 5.04 5 of Article 5 is identical in all six Farm Leases.

SECOND AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

18. In addition, all unfallowed irrigable acres may not be irrigated in excess of a

2 specified "water cap.' If this cap is exceeded, MWD charges an additional fee to the lessee for
m t n o consumptive water use that exceeds an average of about 3.5 to 4 acre-feet of water per 4 irrigable
acre, depending upon the terms of the specific lease. (See, e.g., Lease RL 4061, § 1.06:) This cap
is significantly less than the approximately 5 acre-feet of water per acre typically used to irrigate
crops in PVID. Repeated failure to meet this water cap is cause for MWD to terminate the lease.

7 (See, e.g., Lease RL 4061, § 2.04.)

8 19. Farmers within PVID regularly discuss with each other the status of their farmed

9 lands and farm leases, including with PVID Board members and PVID staff. The prospect of
10 MWD's approval of the Farm Leases was a subject of great interest within PVID. The execution

8 NNNC 9 SNOWINIS HOVNOS 11 of the Farm Leases was a subject that lease holders normally would have discussed broadly
A Professional Corporation 12 within the community,

13 20. PVID is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that following MWD's
14 January 25, 2017 execution of the first lease, with River Valley Ranches, MWD instructed the
15 lease holder that it could not disclose the fact that its lease had been approved and executed,
16 purportedly because other leases still were being negotiated.

17 21. At no time prior to June 13, 2017 did PVID know of the final terms of these leases

18 or that they had been executed.

19 A. Background on Water Rights in the Colorado River

20 22.. The source of water at issue under the Farm Leases is the Colorado River, pursuant

21 to a series of historic agreements and related legislation. The Colorado River Compact was

22 executed by representatives of Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, and
23 California in 1922. Due to concerns about storage and usage increases in Lower Basin states

24 (Arizona, Nevada, and California), this compact divided water from the Colorado River, with 7.5
25 million acre-feet annually (MAF) dedicated to the Lower Basin states. That wäter was not

26 allocated between the Lower Basin states in the compact. In 1928, Congress enacted the Boulder

27 Canyon Project Act which, among other things, authorized contracts between the Lower Basin

28

SECOND AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 6

-

2 states for specific quantities of Colorado River water: 4.4 MAF for California, 2.8 MAF for

3 Arizona, and 300,000 acre-feet annually for Nevada.

23.

A In 1931, seven California water entities entered into a "Seven Party Water

5 Agreement" to assign priorities to the 4.4 MAF of Colorado River water to which California is

6 entitled. The parties to this agreement are PVID, Imperial Irrigation District, Coachella Valley

7 Water District, MWD, the City of Los Angeles, the City of San Diego, and San Diego County.

8 As parties to this agreement, PVID and MWD have regular contact with each other, and the other

9 municipalities, at meetings and conferences to discuss use of Colorado River water.

24.

10 Under the Seven Party Water Agreement, and as declared by the United States

A Professional UOHBJOdIOT 8 NNNU  SNOWIIS HOVINOS 11 Bureau of Reclamation in a 1933 contract executed with PVID, PVID has first-priority rights to

12 the water from the Colorado River that has been allocated to California, as compared to other

13 parties to the agreement. PVID's right to this water is expressed in terms of how much water is

14 necessary to irrigate the lands within PVID's boundaries. The remaining water flows through to

15 the junior water agencies in order of their respective priorities.

25.

16 Pursuant to these authorities, PVID diverts Colorado River water and delivers it to

17 Iandowners within the District. The rights to water delivered within PVID belong to PVID. Like

18 irrigation districts organized under California Irrigation District Law (Wat. Code, §§ 20500

19 et seq.), PVID holds title to water from the Colorado River in trust for landowners within the

20 District. This means that landowners do not have a specific ownership interest in water rights

21 held by PVID, but have an equitable right in the water rights, which are commonly held by PVID

22 for the benefit of all landowners within the District. Most farmlands within PVID's boundaries

23 use approximately 4.6 to 5.2 acre-feet of water per acre to irrigate crops.

B.

24 26. History of MWD's Acquisition of Farmland Within PVID

25 In 2001, MWD acquired 15,920 acres of land within PVID from San Diego Gas &

26 Electric Company. Approximately 8,946 acres involved in that purchase are irrigable farmland.

27 These acres largely comprise the land leased under RL 4061 and RL 4063. When MWD

28 purchased this land, MWD and PVID entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to
form a Property Utilization Committee. This committee was created in an attempt to determine

SECOND AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 how MWD-owned property in PVID's service area could be used to the mutual advantage of both

2 PVID and MWD. The MOU stated that MWD acquired the land in question to ensure that future

3 land use remained compatible with agricultural operations in PVID, and to protect MWD's

4 interests in the Colorado River. The MOU also contemplated a land management, crop rotation,
5 and water supply program that other landowners within PVID could join at their option.
6 27. In 2002, PVID adopted the Palo Verde Land Management, Crop Rotation and
A Water Supply Program (PVID Program). Under the PVID Program, farmers within PVID may
8 refrain from irrigating lands in order to make water available for use within MWD. The PVID
Program allows MWD to purchase this additional "saved" water, which provides stable income to
cap on the amount of farmland that can 10 the farming community. The PVID Program establishes a

uO!BJodiod |buoissajoJd v NNNGY SNOWNIS HOVWOS 11 be taken out of production in any year, and provides that no acre can be fallowed for longer than
12 five consecutive years. Prior to adopting the PVID Program, PVID prepared an EIR that
13 addressed concerns raised by state, federal and local agencies about the potentially significant
14 environmental impacts of fallowing farmland in exchange for water deliveries to MWD. MWD
15 a was identified as a responsible agency under CEQA for the PVID Program EIR, and as such was
16 charged with understanding the potential impacts - and CEQA obligations - associated with the
17 farmland fallowing provisions and MWD's use of any "saved" water.

18 28. During the planning process for the PVID Program, Imperial Irrigation District
19 and Coachella Valley Water District (whose water rights in the Colorado River are junior to
20 PVID, but senior to MWD) also agreed to allow water saved through the PVID Program to pass
21 on to MWD, despite Coachella's intervening rights to Colorado River water.
22 29. During the CEOA process for the PVID Program, comments were received from
23 numerous public agencies, including the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the California

24 Department of Fish and Game, the California Department of Food and Agriculture, the Imperial
25 County Air Pollution Control District, the Southern California Association of Governments, the
26 City of Blythe, Imperial County, and other area irrigation districts. Farmers and residents also
27 commented on the PVID Program. These comments raised concerns about potential air quality
28 impacts related to dust, impacts to raptors and endangered species along the Colorado River,

8 SECOND AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 impacts to recreation from lowered Colorado River levels below PVID and related socioeconomic

2 impacts, groundwater levels from reduced irrigation, impacts to agricultural productivity as a

3 result of taking agricultural land out of production, and related economic impacts to local
4 communities. The EIR for the PVID Program addressed these concerns, and a final EIR was
certified and the project approved in October of 2002.
30. In 2004, PVID and MWD entered into an agreement implementing the PVID
7 Program called the Forbearance and Fallowing Program Agreement (Fallowing Agreement).
This agreement is primarily a means for interested landowners within PVID, including MWD, to
9 conserve water on their land through minor fallowing and make the conserved water available to
10 MWD. The Fallowing Agreement provides that landowners can execute agreements with PVID
NNOI  SNOWNTS HOVINOS 11 and MWD to participate in this program, under which PVID forbears its ability to otherwise use jBuoIssajoad V uonejodion 12 or transfer "saved water" created under these agreements to others, and that the conserved water
13. passes to MWD for its use. In exchange for this water, MWD pays participating landowners
14 based on the acreage fallowed. MWD is also obligated to reimburse PVID for administrative
15 costs associated with the Fallowing Agreement and the landowner programs. The Fallowing
16 Agreement also allows for the executing of Landowner Agreements with participating
17 landowners. These Landowner Agreements govern the implementation of the PVID Program on
18 landowner's specific acreage, and also provide that all parties to the agreement must provide
19 written consent to any assignment of the agreement.
20 31. Following the execution of the Fallowing Agreement, PVID and MWD staff
21 members regularly communicated regarding the status of the PVID Program and the leasing of
22 MWD-owned lands participating in the program.
23 32. In 2005, MWD agreed a to pay $6 million to a fund for community improvement
24 programs and projects that haye as their purpose the economic development of the Palo Verde
25 Valley. This fund was created in response to concerns about the economic impacts that the
26 fallowing of farmland under the Fallowing Agreement could have on the Palo Verde area. The

27 implementing agreement for the fund specifies that its administration shall give priority to
28

SECOND AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 9

2 economic development in those economic sectors of the Palo Verde Valley that could be affected
by the PVID Program.

33. On or about July 14, 2015, MWD's Board of Directors approved the purchase of
12,782 gross acres of farmland within PVID from Verbena LLC, making MWD the largest

6 landowner in PVID. The purchase price was $255,644,000 plus escrow, title, and other closing

7 costs of approximately $8,356,000. This sale was completed in about three weeks. An appraisal

8 was never conducted to support this sale. The stated purpose of the purchase was to reduce risk

9 associated with the amount of water MWD could receive from these lands under the PVID

10 Program and to manage the land in such a way as to result in greater water savings, to which
MWD would then have access.

SOMACH SIMMONS & DUNN d8 11
[euoissajoJa V uOHEJOdIo 34.

12 The subject 12,782 acres were previously owned by a Utah nonprofit corporation,

13 Farmland Reserve, Inc., and were enrolled in the PVID Program through a Landowner

14 Agreement executed on or about February 14, 2005. This land primarily makes up leases

15 RL 4064, RL 4065, RL 4066, and RL 4067, although a few hundred acres are part of leases
RL 4061 and RL 4063.

16 C.

17 35. MWD's Leasing Program for the Farm Leases

18 In February 2016, in an apparent attempt to bypass the obligations of the

19 Fallowing Agreement and generate additional water from parcels it owns, MWD began

20 considering a leasing program with new terms for leases on the lands it owns within PVID. A

21 public MWD Board of Directors memorandum from April 12, 2016 states that the new leases for

22 these properties would include various means to reduce the use of water on the land in order to

23 increase the amount of Colorado River water available to MWD. The "potential management

24 objectives" listed include actions that aim to "[r]educe consumptive water use on the land by

25 growing less water-intensive crops, using more efficient irrigation systems, engaging in deficit

26 irrigation, or other means" and "[a]dvance state-of-the-art farming techniques by adopting

27 innovative irrigation methods, crop selection, and data collection that can serve as a model."

28 Additional stated goals included transparency and community involvement and acceptance.

SECOND AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 10

36. The April Board Memorandum also noted that MWD does not consider the Farm

2 Leases to be "projects" as defined under CEQA in California Code of Regulations, title 14,

3 section 15378, subdivision (b)(2), claiming that the Farm Leases were "administrative activities
such as general policy and procedure making."

5 37. On June 2, 2016, PVID's Board Chairman Bart Fisher met with MWD's Assistant

6 General Manager Jeffrey Kightlinger to discuss MWD's plans for the properties it owned within
7 PVID. At this meeting, PVID expressed its opinion that water saved through conservation
8 requirements in the contemplated leases would remain PVID's water and would not become

9 MWD's water.

10 38. The next day, on June 3, 2016, Mr. Fisher met with MWD's Board Chairman
& NNNU Y SNOIINIS HOVWOS 11 Randy Record and repeated PVID's position that any water saved through conservation A Professional Corporation 12 requirements in the new leases that were being considered by MWD remains with PVID and does
13 not become MWD's water.

14 39. On or about July 27, 2016, the Property Utilization Committee met and MWD
15 discussed its plans to encourage its lessees to implement "innovative farming techniques" to
16 further conserve water on MWD-owned lands in PVID. Again, PVID reiterated its position that
17 any water conserved was outside of the PVID Program, and thus remains with PVID and would
18 not flow to MWD for its use. MWD stated that the terms of any leases were still being developed
19 and that nothing was final.

20 40. On or about August 8, 2016, MWD issued a Request for Statements of Interest

21 (RFSI) to farmers in the Palo Verde Valley area to obtain offers from potential lessees of the
22 majority of the land purchased from Verbena, LLC in 2015. PVID received an RFSI from MWD:
23. The RFSI contained draft lease terms, but also contained a reservation that MWD could amend
24 the final lease terms, and that terms were subject to negotiation with selected lessees.
25 41. On or about September 13, 2016, MWD's Board of Directors considered and

26 approved entry into leases for land in the Palo Verde Valley with HayDay Farms and River
27 Valley. The publicly-available agenda and minutes for this action item included no details or

28 descriptions of the terms or the purposes of these leases. The agenda did not discuss the nature of

SECOND AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 11

the CEQA determination to be made at the meeting, and noted that the "prices and terms of
2 payment" would be discussed in closed session. From this agenda, PVID and other members of

3 the public could not determine the nature of the leases or what environmental impacts they could
4 have. The minutes state only that the leases will be entered into "on the terms described in

5 confidential Item 8-4 board letter." This "confidential" board letter was not posted ahead of the
o meeting or otherwise available to PVID or the public at the time the action took place, nor was it
7 included with the meeting minutes posted on MWD's website following the Board meeting. The
8 minutes show that MWD adopted a CEQA determination that the leases were not considered

9 projects subject to CEQA, or were otherwise exempt from CEQA. This determination was
10 reached without any publicly-disclosed details about the actual leases that could support the
a minutes - not even a citation of which specific categorical 11 determination included in the
uopB1od.10 [euorssajo.rdv NNNA SNOWNIS HOVWOS 12 exemption might apply to the proposed actions. Despite repeated expressions of concern to
approve leases & 13 MWD about the proposed lease terms, MWD did not inform PVID of its intent to
14 at the September 13 meeting, nor did it inform PVID that the leases had been approved. PVID
15 was not aware that these Farm Leases were being discussed or approved at this meeting, nor
16 could it have been aware that the Farm Leases might contain objectionable terms or result in
17 potentially significant environmental impacts, based on the materials publicly available. In light
18 of PVID's repeated objections to the draft lease terms, and MWD's representations in late July of
19 2016 that the leases were still "being developed" and "not final," PVID reasonably assumed that
20 MWD would not approve the leases with terms objectionable to PVID, and would not act on the
21 leases without notifying PVID in advance of its final decision about the lease terms at issue.

22 42. On or about December 13, 2016, MWD's Board of Directors considered and

23 approved the execution of leases for land in the Palo Verde Valley with HayDay Farms, Cox &
24 Wegis, Deconinck, and Desert Milling. Just as with the September 13, 2016 lease authorization,
25 the agenda for the December 13, 2016 board meeting contained no publicly-available staff report
26 or meaningful description of the actions to be taken. The minutes for these actions similarly
27 provided no insight into the terms or the purposes of the leases, stating only that the land, terms,
28 and conditions are "as set forth in Agenda Item 8-8 confidential board letter," and that the terms

1 had also been discussed in closed session. Again, the "confidential" board letter was not posted
2 ahead of the meeting or otherwise available to PVID or the public at the time the action took

3 place. The lease with Desert Milling was originally listed as being a decision against leasing the
4 property to Desert Milling and to approve a short-term lease with the then-current tenant, Wegis
5 & Young. At the meeting this item apparently required some discussion, but the minutes show
6 that the Board immediately went into closed session when directors noted that they wanted to

7 speak on the item. The Board ultimately approved the lease with Desert Milling upon resuming

8 open session. As with the prior two leases, all four lease approvals included a determination that
9 each "proposed action is not defined as a project and is not subject to CEQA." As memorialized
10 in the minutes, the CEQA determination adopted did not mention a that a categorical exemption
SOMACH SIMMONS & DUNN E 11 might apply. No details about the actual leases were provided to support such a determination. uopeodio [Euo[ssa}o.rd V 12 Again, MWD did not inform PVID of its intent to approve the leases at the December 13 meeting,
13 nor did it inform PVID that the leases had been approved.

14 43. Without any knowledge that the Farm Leases had been approved the day before, at
15 a Colorado River Water Users' Association meeting held on or about December 14, 2016,
16 Mr. Fisher again stated to Tim Blair, the MWD staff member in charge of overseeing the léases,
17 PVID's position that any saved water under MWD's potential leases would remain PVID's water,
18 and that PVID objects to any assertion by MWD that it could take the water conserved. MWD
19 did not advise or otherwise notify PVID that the leases had been approved, but instead continued
20 to represent to PVID that the terms were under negotiation. Mr. Blair assured Mr. Fisher that
21 there was "no problem" and that the two agencies "just need[ed] to keep talking," or words to that
22 effect. When asked whether leases dealt with moving conserved water outside of PVID, Mr.
23 Blair stated that there was nothing yet to discuss.
24 44. PVID's General Manager, Ned Hyduke, along with two PVID Board members,
25 met with Mr. Blair in person on January 30, 2017. Mr. Hyduke again asked about the status of
26 the leases and was not provided with any information.

27 45. Mr. Hyduke also conferred with Mr. Blair numerous times between the December
28 14, 2017 meeting and June 2017, regarding the status of the leases. Specifically, the two

SECOND AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 13

1 participated in phone conversations on January 30, 2017; January 31, 2017; February 1, 2017;
2 April 19, 2017; May 18, 2017; May 30, 2017; and May 31, 2017. During each call, Mr. Hyduke
3 would ask Mr. Blair about the status of the Farm Leases in PVID. Each time, Mr. Blair told Mr.

4 Hyduke that Mr. Blair would "get back to" him and that the two should "keep talking."
5 46. Additionally, on March 7, 2017, one of PVID's Board Members met with Mr.
wo Record, Mr. Blair, and a consultant hired by MWD to perform a "water fallow study" on MWD's
7 land within PVID. The general purpose of this study was to review the amount of water savings
8 from conservation practices in the Palo Verde Valley. Even though PVID had expressed
9 concerns on multiple occasions to Mr. Blair and other MWD agents regarding water savings from
10 what PVID at the time understood to be potential conservation measures in leases on MWD-
11 owned land within PVID, and the fact that the purpose of the meeting was to review water uopeiod.1o |euoissajoud v NNNC  SNOWNIS HOVWOS 12 savings from certain conservation practices with the assistance of a hired consultant, MWD
13 nonetheless concealed the existence of the Farm Leases. Specifically, MWD concealed the fact
14 that it had already executed two Farm Leases containing extraordinary conservation measures and
15 was in the process of executing four additional Farm Leases containing the same conservation
to generate water 16 measures. All of the conservation measures in the Farm Leases were intended
17 savings that would be relevant to the study and evaluation of water savings from conservation
18 practices, which was the primary subject of the meeting.
19 47. Ironically, by shielding the key details of the Farm Leases in "confidential" board
20 letters, holding all discussions related to the leases in closed session, and misrepresenting the
21 status of the leases to PVID, MWD disregarded its stated goals of transparency and community
22 involvement in the leasing program. In fact, there was no transparency or community
23 involvement at all. Even PVID's direct inquiries about the Farm Leases did not prompt MWD to
24 divulge pertinent information about the leases. PVID's inquiries were met with untruthful or
25 otherwise misleading responses that the lease terms were still being discussed between the
26 parties, or assurances that MWD would report back to PVID on their status. Furthermore, due to
27 the confidential nature of the MWD Board letters discussing the leases, it is impossible to know
28 from the agendas and minutes of MWD's public meetings whether the terms of the leases or the

1 potential environmental impacts of the leases changed between the August 2016 RFSI and the
2 September 13, 2016 and December 13, 2016 Board meetings, or the time the Farm Leases were

3 executed.

4 48. Unbeknownst to PVID, on or about January 5, 2017, MWD filed a Notice of
5 Exemption (NOE) under CEQA with the Office of Planning and Research (OPR) for Lease RL
6 4061 with HayDay Farms. MWD subsequently claimed to have filed an NOE for this lease with
7 Riverside County. PVID does not know whether this NOE was filed and/or posted to provide
8 notice to the public as required by law.

49, On or about February 8, 2017, MWD filed an NOE under CEQA with OPR for

13 50. On or about March 23, 2017, MWD filed an NOE under CEQA with OPR for
14 Lease RL 4065 with Cox & Wegis. MWD subsequently claimed to have filed an NOE for this
15 lease with Riverside County. PVID does not know whether this NOE was filed and/or posted to
16 provide notice to the public as required by law.

17 51. On or about April 3. 2017, MWD filed NOEs under CEQA with OPR for Leases
18 RL 4066 with Deconinck and RL 4064 with Desert Milling. MWD subsequently claimed to have
19 filed NOEs for these leases with Riverside County. PVID does not know whether the NOEs were
20 filed and/or posted to provide notice to the public as required by law.

21 52. On or about May 4, 2017, MWD filed an NOE under CEQA with OPR for Lease
22 RL 4067 with HayDay Farms. MWD subsequently claimed to have filed an NOE for this lease
23 with Riverside County. PVID does not know whether this NOE was filed and/or posted to

24 provide notice to the public as required by law.
25 53. PVID is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that MWD intentionally
26 waited at least 36 days from the date it claims to have filed the final NOE to inform PVID that

27 MWD had approved and executed the Farm Leases.

1 54.

2 Unlike the December 2016 determinations disclosed in MWD's publicly-available

3 Board materials that the Farm Leases are not projects subject to CEQA, and the September 2016

4 determinations disclosed in MWD's publicly-available Board materials that the Farm Leases were

5 either not projects or categorically exempt from CEQA, based on some unspecified exemption,

6 the NOEs MWD filed for every Farm Lease assert that the leases are categorically exempt from

A CEQA pursuant either to CEQA Guidelines sections 15301 or 15304,3 and that there is "no

D0 possibility that the proposed action in question may have a significant a effect on the environment."

9 These specific exemptions and determinations were never previously mentioned during the

10 approval process for the Farm Leases in any readily available public document. MWD's

[euossajord V uoneiodion SOMACH SIMMONS & DUNN 8 11 determination that there is "no possibility" that lease terms requiring similar or greater fallowing,

12 and more extreme conservation than the actions evaluated in the PVID Program EIR, contradicts

13 the assumption underlying the PVID Program EIR - that such actions might have the potential to

14 result in significant adverse impacts to the environment.

55.

15 On or about June 13, 2017, PVID and MWD representatives met for a Property

16 Utilization Committee meeting. At that meeting, MWD disclosed to PVID for the first time that

17 the leases had all been executed and that each lease included a water cap per irrigable acre in

18 production. In addition to again objecting that this additionally-conserved water would not be

19 available to MWD for its use, PVID also objected that under these terms the Farm Leases would

20 be damaging to the agricultural community within PVID's service area.

56.

21 After the June 13, 2017 meeting, PVID requested copies of the Farm Leases from

22 MWD. PVID received copies of all six Farm Leases via email on or about June 14, 2017. The

23 receipt of the Farm Lease documents was PVID's first opportunity to view all of the lease

24 purposes and terms. Previously the ultimate lease purpose and terms had been entirely

25 undisclosed to the public and to PVID.

57.

26 Because PVID did not know that MWD had approved any of the Farm Leases, and

27 communications directly with MWD staff and MWD Board members indicated that continued

28 discussions with MWD would address PVID's concerns with the conservation measures in the
The "CEQA Guidelines" refer to California Code of Regulations, title 14, section 15000, et seq.

SECOND AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 16

1 Farm Leases, PVID had no reason, prior to June 13, 2017, to suspect that MWD had made a

2 CEQA determination or would file an NOE. Thus, PVID had no reason to request a copy of any
3 NOE from MWD or reasonable belief that it should search for any NOE at the County Clerks'

4 offices of Riverside or Imperial Counties, which are located two and one-half and two and three-
quarters hours driving time, respectively, from PVID's headquarters in Blythe, California. Only
after PVID learned that MWD had approved and executed the leases did PVID, upon its own

7 investigation, learn that MWD had filed NOEs with OPR. PVID attempted to determine whether

8 MWD also had filed NOEs with Riverside County and Imperial County by accessing each
9 County's respective websites; however, the NOEs were not available on those Counties'
10 websites.

11 58. At all relevant times, MWD knew that it had approved the Farm Leases, which
uonexod.ion NNNC 3 SNOWNINIS HOVWOS 12 contained extraordinary conservation measures; that it had made CEQA determinations regarding
13 the Farm Leases; and that it had filed NOEs for the Farm Leases with Riverside and Imperial
[EuoIssajoJd V 14 Counties. MWD also, whether intentionally or unintentionally, misrepresented or concealed the

regard 15 true state of facts regarding the content of the Farm Leases and the status of those leases in

16 to CEQA in order to prevent PVID from timely taking legal action related to the Farm Leases.
17 59. PVID was, until June 13, 2017, unaware that the Farm Leases, particularly
18 including the extraordinary conservation measures, had been approved and executed, and that
19 MWD had made CEQA determinations for each Farm Lease. Based on PVID's long history of
20 working cordially and collaboratively with MWD, PVID reasonably and justifiably relied upon
21 MWD's repeated representations that the parties would be able to resolve PVID's concerns with
22 conservation measures in leases on MWD land and that actions by MWD with respect to the
23 leases were not final, and thus did not take additional actions to investigate or confirm the status
24 of MWD's actions with respect to the leases prior to June 13, 2016.
25 60. MWD's- and its staff and Board Members' - affirmative misrepresentations and
26 deliberate concealment of MWD's actions taken on the leases prevented PVID from knowing the
27 true state of facts surrounding the content of the Farm Leases and the CEQA determinations made

1 on the Farm Leases. Therefore, MWD is estopped from asserting the statute of limitations as a

2 defense to this case.

STANDING 3

4 61. PVID is beneficially interested in the subject matter of this proceeding because the

5 Farm Leases may adversely affect agricultural and other environmental resources within PVID's

6 boundaries, which can in turn significantly change the character and environment of the district.

7 By failing to acknowledge that the Farm Leases are projects subject to CEQA, and by failing to
8 disclose pertinent information to the public regarding the potential impacts of the Farm Leases on

9 the environment, MWD has put the agricultural character and environment of the PVID area at

10 significant risk. Therefore, PVID has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition.
NOTICE E NNNO  SNOWINIS HOVWOS 11
uofeJodio |euoissajodd V 12 62. On August 3, 2017, pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.5, PVID
13 a served a notice on MWD informing MWD of PVID's intent to file a petition for writ of mandate
14 challenging MWD's failure to comply with CEQA requirements and conduct an environmental
15 review of the Farm Leases. A copy of PVID's notice and associated proof of service is attached

16 hereto as Exhibit A and is incorporated herein by reference.
ATTORNEYS' FEES 17

18 63. PVID is entitled to receive attorneys' fees from MWD pursuant to Code of Civil
19 Procedure section 1021.5 because this action involves the enforcement of important rights
20 affecting the public interest. PVID has environmental, operational, scientific, and economic
21 interests in the Palo Verde Valley, its water resources and its wildlife, and in facilities that will be

22 affected by the Farm Leases. These interests will be directly and adversely affected by the Farm

• 23 Leases, the approval of which violates provisions of law as set forth in this Petition and which
24 would cause irreversible harm to the environment. PVID has a direct and beneficial interest in

25 MWD's compliance with CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines. The maintenance and prosecution of
26 this action will confer a substantial benefit on the public by protecting the public from the

27 environmental and other harms alleged herein, making an award of fees appropriate.

28

18 SECOND AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 STANDARD OF REVIEW

2 64. Pursuant to Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5, and Code of Civil
3 Procedure sections 1085 or 1094.5, the Court reviews MWD's interpretations of law and the legal
4 effects of any MWD findings on a de novo basis, including whether MWD proceeded in the
manner required by law.

6 INADEQUATE REMEDY AT LAW - STAY AND INJUNCTION

7 65. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, subdivision (g), the
8 Court may stay or enjoin the operation of any administrative decision or order involved in this

9 proceeding.

10 66. In light of MWD's violation of CEQA in determining that the Farm Leases are not
ã NNNCY SNOWNIS HOVWOS 11 projects subject to CEQA, and its failure to publicly disclose pertinent information about the [euogssajo.d V uogeJodion 12 nature of the Farm Leases, any action regarding the fallowing/conservation calls provided for in
13 the Farm Leases will irreparably harm the environment as described in this Petition, to the
14 detriment of PVID, its water users, farmers, and others. PVID lacks an adequate remedy at law
15 for the irreparable harm that the Farm Leases will cause. Therefore, a stay or preliminary
16 injunction should issue in this case restraining MWD from taking any additional actions to fallow
17 land or enforce the water cap under the Farm Leases until MWD complies with CEQA.
18 67. A stay or injunction of MWD's actions relating to the Farm Leases would not be
19 against the public interest because MWD is required by CEQA to conduct an adequate
20 environmental review of the Farm Leases, as they present foreseeable direct and indirect adverse
21 impacts to the environment specifically to agricultural lands. MWD will not be harmed by a
22 stay or injunction of the fallowing/conservation provisions of the Farm Leases.
23 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

24 (Writ of Mandate - Violation of CEQA)
25 68. PVID re-alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 67 above as
26 though set forth in full herein.

27 69. CEQA requires that the lead agency determine whether an action it is proposing to
28 undertake is a project as defined by CEQA. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21080.) A CEQA project is

SECOND AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 19

"the whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in
2 the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment, and
3 that is, among other things, "[a]n activity involving the issuance to a person of a lease ... by one
4 or more public agencies." "EQA Guidelines, § 15378(a)(3).)
4n 70. If the action is a project, the lead agency must then determine what level of
environmental review is appropriate for the project: a negative declaration, a mitigated negative
7 declaration, or an EIR. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21080.1.) If there exists a fair argument that a
8 project may result in a significant impact (defined as a "substantial, or potentially substantial,

9 adverse change in any of the physical conditions within the area affected by the project, including
10 land, air, water, minerals, flora, fauna, ambient noise, and objects of historic or aesthetic
A Professional Corporation NNAM Y SNOWIIS HOVNOS 11 significance'4), an EIR is required. (No Oil, Inc. V. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75.)
12 71. Contrary to MWD's determination, each Farm Lease, and the leases collectively as
13 part of a leasing program, are CEQA projects, and MWD was required to analyze and disclose
14 their impacts pursuant to CEQA. In its September and December 2016 Board minutes, MWD
15 asserted that these leases were not projects subject to CEQA, relying on CEQA Guidelines,
16 section 15378(b)(2),5 but this exception to CEQA's definition of "project" does not cover the
17 actions taking place under the Farm Leases. The CEQA Guidelines, section 15378(b)(2), specify
18 that a CEQA project does not include "[c]ontinuing administrative or maintenance activities, such
19 as purchases for supplies, personnel-related actions, general policy and procedure making (except
20 as they are applied to specific instances covered above [in section 15378(a))."
21 72. The NOEs filed for every Farm Lease assert that the leases are categorically
22 exempt from CEQA pursuant to either CEQA Guidelines sections 15301 or 15304, despite the
23 fact that no categorical exemption formed the basis of the CEQA determination for the four Farm
24 Leases approved in December 2016, and that no specific exemption was discussed when two

exempts 25 Farm Leases were approved in September 2016. CEQA Guidelines section 15301

26

27 4 CEQA Guidelines, section 15382.

28 5 The September 2016 Board minutes also vaguely claim in the alternative that the two leases are "categorically exempt,' without specifying which CEQA exemption MWD believes would apply.

SECOND AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 20

1 projects from CEQA that involve the operation, repair, or leasing of existing facilities involving

2 negligible or no expansion of use, and notes that "[t]he key consideration is whether the project
involves negligible or no expansion of an existing use." CEQA Guidelines section 15304
exempts minor alterations to land, water, or vegetation that do not include the removal of healthy

and mature trees.

6 73. The Farm Leases do not constitute administrative or maintenance activities, nor do
they fall into the exemptions cited in the NOEs. For instance, CEQA Guidelines section 15301

8 lists numerous examples of exempt activities, all of which relate to the operation, repair, or

9 leasing of structures rather than farmland. For this reason, the Farm Leases do not fit into the

10 exemption outlined in section 15301. CEQA Guidelines section 15304 relates only to minor

NNNU Y SNOIWIS HOVWOS 11 alterations of land and water, but the Farm Leases change the land use and water use on
• A Professional Corporation 12 thousands of acres of farmland within PVID to such a degree that farmland designated as Prime

13 Farmland could lose that designation.

14 74. The Farm Leases have the potential to result in direct physical changes to the

15 environment in numerous ways, namely in impacts on agricultural resources, air quality,

16 biological resources, hydrology, recreational resources and aesthetics. This means that the

17 categorical exemptions would not apply in any event. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15300.2(b)-(c).) In

18 this way they are strikingly similar to the types of activities evaluated in the PVID Program EIR.

19 When the potentially significant environmental impacts associated with the water cap and

20 heightened water conservation provisions are considered, the Farm Leases' potential impacts in

21 these areas are substantially more severe than those disclosed in the PVID Program EIR. The

22 Farm Leases also have the potential to induce growth in MWD's service area, because more

23 water can be directed to water users in MWD's service area. In addition, the Farm Leases have

24 the potential to result in significant cumulative impacts to the environment, particularly related to

25 the existing Fallowing Agreement between PVID and MWD. For these reasons, the conclusion

26 in the NOEs for the Farm leases that there is "no possibility that the proposed action in question

27 may have a significant effect on the environment" is incorrect and not supported by substantial

28 evidence.

SECOND AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 21

75. Because - the Farm Leases authorize - and in fact mandate - certain types of
2 physical activities relating to the use and management of land and water resources that will result
3 in direct physical changes to the environment, and fall squarely within the definition of "project"
4 under CEQA Guidelines section 15378(a)(3), MWD prejudicially abused its discretion and failed
5 to proceed in the manner required by law in determining that they were not subject to CEQA.
6 Potential and Reasonably Foreseeable Impacts on Agricultural Resources
7 76. Impacts to agricultural resources include the loss of agricultural land within
8 PVID's service area, particularly to lands classified by the State of California as Prime Farmland

9 and Farmland of Statewide Importance. The conservation requirements under the Farm Leases,
10 particularly the very low consumptive use cap, could directly take agricultural land out of
11. production for years at a time, given that partial or complete voluntary fallowing may be the only [euoissajodd V uonexodion NNNI  SNOWWIS HOVWOS 12 means through which the consumptive use cap can be met. Long periods of time without
13 irrigation can affect land's classification as Prime Farmland or Farmland of Statewide

14 Importance, thereby degrading the quality of the farmland.
15 77. No investigation or substantial evidence supports MWD's assertions that there is
16 "no possibility" that the Farm Leases will have an adverse effect on agriculture. In fact, because
17 of the unique situation of farmland within PVID, there may be no viable means of conserving
18 water to the degree required by the Farm Leases without at least partial fallowing of acreage
19 beyond that subject to a fallowing call. This additional fallowing takes even more land out of
20 agricultural production and puts the agricultural productivity of PVID in an even more precarious
21 position.

22 78. Agricultural resources can be indirectly affected by the Farm Leases, because
23 agricultural productivity in an area depends on a critical mass of farmland in production. The
24 fallowing calls and extreme conservation requirements under the Farm Leases could leave
25 patchwork of unused lands surrounded by lands in production - or vice versa - and therefore
26 adversely impact the vibrancy and productivity of agricultural lands in PVID's service area. As
27 productivity declines, the pressure to convert lands to other uses aside from agriculture may creep
28

SECOND AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 22

into these areas, resulting in the loss of farmland and extinguishing the agricultural heritage of the
2 Palo Verde Valley.

3 79. These impacts are similar to impacts noted in the comments on the Notice of
4 Preparation for the PVID Program EIR raised by the California Department of Agriculture.
5 Given the similarity between the programs (i.e., fallowing of agricultural lands to conserve water

6 for MWD's use outside the Palo Verde Valley), substantial evidence supports a fair argument that
7 the Farm Leases could result in these same potentially significant adverse impacts to agriculture.
8 Under CEQA, MWD was required to evaluate and disclose these impacts in an EIR for its leasing
9 program.

10 Potential and Reasonably Foreseeable Impacts to Air Quality
11 80. Impacts to air quality due to the Farm Leases are primarily related to potential dust uogeiodiod [euotssayo.d v NNNO Y SNOWWIS HOVWOS 12 generation from the fallowing of hundreds to thousands of acres of farmland. Dust is a form of
13 particulate matter (PM10) that is classified as a pollutant and controlled by the Federal Clean Air
14 Act. Both Riverside and Imperial Counties are classified as "nonattainment" for compliance with
15 state and federal regulations aimed at limiting PM10 emissions. Leaving bare soil with no
16 vegetation means that the soil is susceptible to being blown away by wind, adding PM10 to the air
17 and contributing to existing air quality violations.
18 81. The Farm Leases themselves acknowledge that dust is a potential issue associated
19 with the fallowing calls, and incorporate some measures to attempt to reduce this impact;
20 however, the extent of the impact, even with dust reduction measures, is unknown and has not
21 been evaluated and disclosed under CEQA. (See, e.g., Lease RL 4061, § 5.04; Exhibit F to Lease
22 RL 4061.) Air quality impacts related to the generation of PM1o from the implementation of the
23 Farm Leases is a potentially significant adverse environmental impact; CEQA requires that MWD
24 analyze, disclose, and if necessary, mitigate those impacts in an EIR prepared for MWD's leasing
25 program.

26 Potential and Reasonably Foreseeable Impacts to Biological Resources
27 82. Sensitive biological resources, such as raptors and endangered species, will also
28 potentially be directly impacted by the fallowing and extreme conservation measures required in

23 SECOND AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

can P the Farm Leases. As noted in the California Department of Fish and Game's comments related to
2 the PVID Program EIR, the change in Colorado River flows at different diversion points
3 affect riparian habitat and allow invasive plants to establish themselves along waterways.
4 Additionally, agricultural lands provide important habitat for raptor species and wading bird
5 species, year-round and during migrations. Loss of these lands, even temporarily, could greatly

6 impact these bird species.

7 83. Because no investigation has been done into the impacts of these leases, it is

8 unknown whether other special-status species or protected habitats would be affected by

9 fallowing under the Farm Leases. A complete assessment of these species and habitat should
10 have been made to fully understand the potential impacts that could occur due to fallowing calls
11 under the Farm Leases. Therefore, MWD had no evidence to support its determination that there NNAG 12 was no possibility that the Farm Leases would result in a significant impact a to the environment. 8 uOfBIOdIOO [EuOIssajoid V. SNOWINIS HOVWOS 13 Because substantial evidence supports a fair argument that the Farm Leases could result in a

14 significant impact to biological resources, MWD was required under CEQA to prepare an EIR
15 that fully analyzed, disclosed and mitigated these potential impacts.
16 Potential and Reasonably Foreseeable Impacts to Hydrology
17 84. The reduction and cessation of irrigation activities under the Farm Leases could

18 also have impacts on groundwater recharge and groundwater levels in the Palo Verde Valley.
19 Reducing the water used on a parcel of land means that less water can infiltrate into groundwater
20 reservoirs. The EIR for the PVID. Program identified that groundwater levels could decrease
21 under that program due to this reduced infiltration. The potential significance of impacts to

22 groundwater resources is even greater today given the increasing importance of groundwater
23 reservoirs to California's water stability. Because substantial evidence supports a fair argument

24 that the Farm Leases could result in potentially significant hydrologic impacts, MWD was
25 required under CEQA to prepare an EIR that evaluated, disclosed and mitigated those impacts,
26 along with alternatives capable of avoiding those impacts.

27

24 28

SECOND AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

F Potential and Reasonably Foresecable Aesthetic Impacts
2 85. The Palo Verde Valley has a rich agricultural history. Fallowing thousands of
3 acres of farmland annually and seasonally would leave bare land where there were once crops,
4 changing the appearance of the land and potentially degrading the existing visual character of the
valley. Imperial County's Planning and Building Department raised similar concerns in its
comments on the PVID Program EIR. CEQA requires that MWD evaluate and disclose, and if
7 necessary mitigate, the potentially significant impacts to the visual character of the Palo Verde

8 Valley in an EIR for MWD's farm leasing program.

9 Potential and Reasonably Foreseeable Impacts on Growth Inducement
10 86. PVID is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the goal of the Farm
: DUNN SNOIIAIS HOVWOS 11 Leases is to save water that would have been used by PVID such that the extra water flows uoperod.1o [euorssajoud v 12 3 through to MWD for its use. To the extent that the leases give MWD access to more water than it
13 previously has had, they have the potential to induce growth within MWD's service area by
14 potentially allowing MWD to promise water deliveries to new developments within its service
15 area. CEQA requires that MWD evaluate and disclose the potential for growth inducement, and
16 resulting significant environmental impacts associated with new development facilitated by the
17 water made available through the Farm Leases in an EIR prepared for the leasing program.
18 Potential and Reasonably Foreseeable Cumulative Impacts
19 87. Under CEQA, a lead agency must find that a project may have a significant impact
20 on the environment, and thereby require an EIR for that project, where there is substantial

21 evidence that the project may have possible environmental effects that are individually limited but
cumulatively considerable. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15065(a).) "Cumulatively considerable" means 22

23 that the incremental effects of an individual project are significant when viewed in connection
24 with the effects of past projects, other current projects, and future projects. (CEQA Guidelines,
25 con 15065(a)(3).) For each of the impacts discussed previously, there is substantial evidence that
26 the Farm Leases, individually and a together as a leasing program, may have possible
27 environmental effects that are cumulatively considerable. For example, it is reasonably
28 foreseeable that the severe conservation requirements on agricultural lands under the Farm Leases

- will contribute to

2 greater farmland losses in PVID's service area, considering the fallowing

3 program already in place between PVID and MWD under the Fallowing Agreement, as well as
the numerous other pressures facing California agriculture in the 21 st century.
88. Additionally, the impacts identified in the PVID Program EIR would potentially

6 be increased due to the cumulative nature of the additional conservation requirements under the

7 Farm Leases. Implementation of the leases has the potential to have incremental effects to air

8 quality, biological resources, hydrology, recreational resources and aesthetics that are significant

9 in light of the PVID Program effects. Similarly, it is reasonable to assume that any growth

10 inducement related to the Fallowing Agreement would be compounded by the Farm Leases

NNNO  SNOININIS HOVINOS 11 providing even more "saved water" for MWD's use, further contributing to significant impacts in

A Professional uOnBIodaon 12 the growth areas. Thus MWD was required to prepare an EIR for the Farm Leases.

89.

13 All of these foregoing potential environmental impacts would have been raised by

14 PVID or other members of the public if MWD had properly given notice of its actions and intent

15 regarding the Farm Leases. Rather than being forthcoming about the Farm Leases, their status at

16 any given time, and their goals, MWD and the MWD Board made varying representations about

17 the Farm Leases along the way. For example, there were substantial differences between the

18 lease terms and CEQA determinations as described and disclosed in MWDs Board agendas and

19 minutes, which were different still from the executed leases and NOEs. Most critically, MWD,

20 and MWD Board members, made affirmative misrepresentations regarding, and deliberately

21 concealed (and directed others to conceal), MWD's actions with respect to the leases in response

22 to direct questions from PVID, which prevented PVID from knowing that it had it a ripe cause of
action under CEQA.

23 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

24 WHEREFORE, PVID requests the following relief:

25 1.

26 For a stay, temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and permanent

27 injunction prohibiting any actions by MWD, the MWD Board, or Real Parties in Interest pursuant

28 to MWD's ability under the Farm Leases to a make a fallowing call or enforce the water cap on any

4 a. MWD and MWD Board to vacate their determination that the Farm Leases

5 are not projects subject to CEQA;

6 b. MWD and MWD Board to void their approval of the Farm Leases;

7 C. MWD, MWD Board, and Real Parties in Interest to suspend any and all

8 activities pursuant to the Farm Leases until MWD has complied with all requirements of CEQA

9 and all other applicable state and local laws, policies, ordinances, and regulations as are directed

15 and

16 5. For such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

Re: Notice of Intent to File CEQA Lawsuit - Palo Verde Irrigation District
Dear Mr. Record and Board of Directors:

Pursuant to section 21167.5 of the Public Resources Code, this letter is to inform the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) that Palo Verde Irrigation District will file an action in Riverside County Superior Court on August 4, 2017, challenging MWD's determination that six leases of farmland (Farm Leases) within PVID's service area are not subject to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The Farm Leases would require lessees to fallow up to half of the leased, irrigable acreage upon notice by MWD and otherwise strictly curtail water usage on the leased land, potentially impacting the physical environment in the Palo Verde Valley,
The City's lawsuit will allege that the actions of MWD violated CEQA (Public Resources Code, § 21000 et scq.) and will seek a peremptory writ of mandate.
Please contact the undersigned if you have any questions,

Very truly yours,
