2 Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

INTRODUCTION AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
2 1. This case is brought by Petitioners and Plaintiffs Protect Our Homes and Hills,
3 Hills For Everyone, Endangered Habitats League, Inc. and Friends of Harbors, Beaches and
4 Parks, Inc. ("Petitioners") challenging the Esperanza Hills development project (the "Project")
5 proposed for an undeveloped 469 acre site on the northeastern edge of the City of Yorba Linda
6 (the "City") and within its sphere of influence.

2. In this action, Petitioners challenge: Respondents' and Defendants', County of
8 Orange and Board of Supervisors of the County of Orange (collectively "County"), approval of
9 the Project, County Project No. PA120037; Certification of a Second Revised Final
10 Environmental Impact Report 616 ("SRFEIR") for the Project, State Clearinghouse No.
11 2012121071; Adoption of a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program ("MMRP"), Findings
12 of Fact and a Statement of Overriding Considerations; General Plan Land Use Amendment;
13 Zone Change; Approval of Vesting Tentative Tract Map 17522; and Adoption of the Esperanza
14 Hills Specific Plan as amended.
15 3. Petitioners seeks a writ of mandate directing the County to set aside these land-
16 use approvals as these approvals violate the California Environmental Quality Act "(CEQA"),
17 Pub. Resources Code section 21000 et seq.; Planning and Zoning Law, Gov. Code § 65000 et
18 seq.; the Subdivision Map Act, Gov. Code § 66410 et seq.; and the County's ordinances, as
19 alleged below.
20 4. This action is brought without waiver of Petitioners' objections to the County's
21 Return of the Supplemental Writ of Administrative Mandamus and/or Petitioners' opposition to
22 County's Motion to Discharge the Supplemental Writ issued by this Court on April 3, 2018 in
23 related Case No. 2015-30-00797300-CU-TT-CXC. This action is brought without waiver of the
24 issues raised in Petitioners' pending appeal of the trial court's order discharging the initial writ,
25 Court of Appeal Case No. G055716 and issues raised in related consolidated Case No. 2017-
26 •00925230-CU-WM-CXC.
27 5. The Project site is an unincorporated County island consisting of 469
28

3 Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 undeveloped acres, with restricted access located in the northeast portion of the City's sphere of
2 influence. The Project site has eight sides, four of which are bordered by Chino Hills State Park
3 ("CHSP) including portions to the north, east, and south. The Project's western edge borders
4 the undeveloped but concurrently proposed and now approved Cielo Vista development project
5 ("Cielo Vista") with which the Project will share infrastructure. A portion of the Project's
6 southern edge borders existing residential development in the City.

6. The Project proposes development of a gated community of 340 single family
8 homes within a Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone with many documented fires in the past,
9 15 to 16 million cubic yards of grading, and unresolved issues concerning feasibility and safety
10 of access to, and evacuation routes from, the Project. Petitioners are informed and believe that
11 the latest approved access to the Project will require building a private road on City
12 dedicated/controlled/owned open space. According to the SRFEIR, City is a Responsible
13 Agency.
14 7. To date, City has not complied with its statutory responsibilities as a Responsible
15 Agency under CEQA (CEQA Guidelines § 15381) to: (1) reach its own conclusions on whether
16 and how to approve the Project; (2) find feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures
17 within its powers that would substantially lessen or avoid any significant effect the Project would
18 have on the environment (CEQA Guidelines § 15096(g)(2)); (3) deny the Project in order to
19 avoid direct or indirect environmental effects of that part of the Project which the Responsible
20 Agency would be called on to carry out or approve (CEQA Guidelines § 15042); (4) require
21 preparation of a subsequent/supplemental EIR to fully analyze impacts of Access Option 1A; and
22 (5) make its own findings required under CEQA supported by substantial evidence.
23 8. The Project is one of four planned development projects in the area known as the
24 "Murdock Property" consisting of several separately owned properties totaling 630 acres. The
25 Murdock Property also includes Cielo Vista (also referred to as the Sage project), Bridal Hills
26 LLC (also referred to as the Friend project) and Yorba Linda Land LLC.
27 9. The Yorba Linda General Plan ("YLGP") preferred alternative for the Murdock
28

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for
Injunctive Relief

1 is Property is annexation into the City and contemplates "one or more specific plans, composed of
2 all eight properties, or compatible combinations of property owners, to provide a comprehensive
3 development and circulation system."
4 10. As the designated "Lead Agency" (Pub. Resources Code § 21067) for the Project,
5 County certified a Final EIR on March 10, 2015, and later approved a General Plan Amendment,
6 Zone Change and Specific Plan on June 2, 2015 (collectively "initial, vacated approvals") and a
7 preferred access alternative which included two full-time access roads and one separate
8 emergency access/ingress for firefighters known as Option 2B. County adopted an alternate
9 access, also with two full-time access roads and one separate firefighter emergency access
10 known as Option 2 Modified. County certified the EIR for the initial, vacated approvals despite
11 serious concerns expressed by numerous citizens, organizations, including Petitioners, and other
12 responsible and trustee agencies regarding the EIR's omissions and errors, the Project's
13 environmental impacts, the adequacy of review of these impacts in the EIR, and the adequacy of
14 mitigation measures or alternatives proposed to reduce or mitigate these impacts and in the
15 absence of evidence of feasibility of the necessary access for the Project.
16 11. No tentative map was approved in connection with the initial approvals and no
17 findings were made in connection with any tentative map at the time of the initial approvals.
18 12. The original Specific Plan for the initial, vacated approvals included a condition
19 requiring that the Project applicant enter into a pre-annexation agreement with the City prior to
20 Board approval of any tentative map.
21 13. On July 2, 2015, Petitioners herein filed a Petition for Writ of Mandate and
22 Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief in this Court, challenging the initial approvals
23 and naming County as Respondents and Yorba Linda Land, LLC as Real Party in Interest, Case
24 No. 2015-30-00797300-CU-TT-CXC ("the initial action"). On July 22, 2016, after hearings on
25 the merits in the initial action, the trial court found "because the EIR impermissibly defers
26 mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) impacts and also arbitrarily limits the extent to which these
27 mitigation measures must be considered, the Court intends to issue a writ on this basis."
28

5 Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 14. On August 24, 2016, the trial court issued a Judgment granting the Writ of
2 Mandate and a Writ of Mandate directing County to immediately vacate all initial approvals and
3 certification of the EIR, revise the EIR in accordance with CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, the
4 trial court's Statement of Decision, the Judgment and the Writ, and to bring the EIR into
5 compliance with CEQA by resolving deficiencies identified by the Court in its Statement of
6 Decision.

15. On October 22, 2016, Petitioners timely appealed portions of the Judgment not in
8 their favor (Court of Appeal Case No. G054185).
9 16. Thereafter, County prepared a Revised EIR ("REIR") purportedly correcting the
10 GHG errors identified by the trial court and Specific Plan Amendment ("SPA") which changed 11 the Project in a critical way unrelated to the GHG analysis and included changes to the Project 12 triggering required supplemental environmental review and circulation of the REIR for public
13 and agency review and comment.
14 17. Specifically, the SPA proposed a modification of a previously rejected access
15 alternative (Option 1) bisecting biologically sensitive Blue Mud Canyon which now included: a
16 468 foot bridge; only one full-time/daily access and evacuation route for the 340 unit subdivision
17 onto a road shared with Cielo Vista and other existing residences (Stonehaven/Via del Agua) and
18 crossing City dedicated/controlled/owned land; and emergency access for firefighters/emergency
19 personnel through Cielo Vista via a disputed easement. This revised access alternative was
20 denominated "Option Modified",
21 18. Contrary to the City's requests, the SPA also proposed deleting the condition that 22 the Project applicant enter into a pre-annexation agreement with the City prior to Board approval
23 of the Specific Plan.
24 19. The County did not formally circulate the REIR for public and agency review and
25 comment as required by CEQA depriving Petitioners, responsible and trustee agencies and the
26 public of their right to analyze Project changes relating to the previously rejected access. Even if
27 circulated, the REIR failed to adequately analyze the impacts of the changed road access.
28

6 Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 20. On December 13, 2016, the Board of Supervisors vacated all initial approvals and
2 certification of the EIR for the initial approvals. However, the Board referred the REIR and
3 related SPA back to the Planning Commission with directions to consider a second full-
4 time/daily access via Aspen Way, to conduct further study regarding the bridge option and to
5 consider a reduced unit project.
6 21. On January 11, 2017, the Planning Commission directed planning staff to analyze
7 a secondary access option via Aspen Way and/or a reduced project utilizing Modified Option
8 or Option 1 access, with the option of increasing units should a full-time/daily secondary access
9 be obtained.
10 22. Rather than analyzing these options as directed, planning staff, working at the
11 apparent direction of the applicant, simply recited the applicant's response to the Board's
12 requests without any independent analysis of the issues by staff or the Planning Commission.
13 Ultimately, yet another unanalyzed access modification was proposed, Option 1A, which
14 consisted of: a smaller bridge but one which was still 10 times larger than an original arched
15 culvert proposed in original Option 1; only one full-time/daily access/evacuation route for the
16 340 unit subdivision onto a neighborhood street to be shared with Cielo Vista and other existing
17 residences (Stonehaven/Via del Agua) and crossing City owned/controlled land for which the
18 applicant had not established any right of use; and emergency access for firefighters/emergency
19 personnel through Cielo Vista via disputed easement.
20 23. On March 22, 2017, the Planning Commission, approved the REIR, adopted
21 Planning Commission Resolution No. 17-01 recommending the Board certify the REIR and
22 adopt the General Plan Amendment, Zone Change and Specific Plan; however, the Planning
23 Commission expressly and unanimously included a condition that the Specific Plan be modified
24 to include a secondary full-time/daily access roadway and recommended that a pre-annexation
25 agreement with the City be required.
26 24. On May 9, 2017, the Board, in a remarkable rebuke of home District Supervisor
27 4 Spitzer and the City, voted 4 to 1 with Supervisor Spitzer dissenting to certify the REIR and all
28

7 Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 Project approvals and approved the 340 unit Project with a single access, identified as access
2 Option 1A and a Specific Plan without the pre-annexation agreement condition requested by City
3 ("the 2017 Approvals").
4 25. On May 10, 2017, County filed a Notice of Determination for the REIR.
5 26. On June 9, 2017, Petitioners and North County BRS Project, LLC, filed separate
6 actions challenging the 2017 Approvals, Case Nos. 30-2017-00925277-CU-TT-CXC and 30-
7 2017-00925230-CU-WM-CXC, respectively; these matters were later consolidated with Case
8 No. 30-2017-00925230-CU-WM-CXC as the lead case ("the 2017 Actions").
9 27. On October 13, 2017, the Court of Appeal, Fourth Appellate District, Division 3
10 found in Petitioners' favor on three issues raised in Court of Appeal Case No. G054185 and
11 explained "the final environmental impact report did not contain the accurate and stable
12 description of the project's environmental setting required by CEQA, nor did it adequately
13 mitigate fire hazard impacts or properly analyze water supply availability." Accordingly, the
14 Court of Appeal directed that the trial court "shall modify the judgment to indicate the Petition
15 for Writ of Mandate is also granted with respect to the issues of environmental setting [Chino
16 Hills State Park], fire hazard mitigation, and water demand and supply. In addition, the modified
17 judgment shall order the issuance of an additional peremptory writ of mandate, consistent with
18 Public Resources Code section 21168.9. The writ shall direct County of Orange and Board of
19 Supervisors of the County of Orange to (1) revise the EIR for the Project, in accordance with
20 CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, to correct the deficiencies identified in this opinion
21 concerning the Project's environmental setting, fire hazard mitigation, and water demand and
22 supply analysis; and (2) take such further action, or refrain from taking certain action, as the
23 court deems proper in accordance with Public Resources Code section 21168.9. Nothing in this
24 opinion shall affect the peremptory writ of mandate issued by the trial court on August 24,
25 2016.33
26 28. On February 27, 2018, the trial court stayed the 2017 Actions. On April 3, 2018,
27 the trial court issued an Amended Judgment granting Supplemental Writ of Mandate and a
28

8 Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

Supplemental Writ of Mandate directing County to vacate all 2017 Approvals and certification
2 of the REIR, revise the REIR in accordance with CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, the Court of
Appeal Decision, the Amended Judgment and the Supplemental Writ, and to bring the REIR into
4 compliance with CEQA by resolving deficiencies identified by the Court of Appeal in its
decision.
6 29. On July 31, 2018, County vacated the 2017 Approvals.
7 30. In August 2018, County released an Additional Environmental Analysis (*AEA")
8 purportedly revising the 2017 REIR and purportedly addressing the infirmities identified by the
Court of Appeal in Case No. G054185 and the trial court in the Supplemental Writ and Amended
10 Judgment. The AEA and the REIR were referred to collectively as the SRFEIR. In all other
11 respects, the SRFEIR and the related project approvals remained unchanged from the 2017
12 Approvals.
13 31. On September 25, 2018, on a 4-1 vote with home Supervisor Spitzer again
14 dissenting, County reapproved the Project with only one regular full-time/daily access and one
15 firefighter/emergency personnel access and the related project entitlements and certified the
16 SRFEIR.
17 32. On October 5, 2018, the parties stipulated that the 2017 Actions shall be
18 dismissed without waiver of the issues raised therein.
19 33. In re-approving the Project with only one regular full-time access and one
20 emergency access for firefighters and certifying the SRFEIR, County has again failed to comply
21 with CEQA, California Zoning and Planning Law and the Subdivision Map Act. Petitioners
22 therefore petition this Court for a writ of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure §§1085 and
23 1094.5 and Public Resources Code §§21168 and 21168.5 directing Respondent County to vacate
24 and set aside its approval of the Project; VTTM 17522; certification of the SRFEIR, the MMRP,
25 Findings of Fact and a Statement of Overriding Considerations; General Plan Land Use
26 Amendment; Zone Change; and the Esperanza Hills Specific Plan as amended. These claims are
27 based on the following allegations:

1 JURISDICTION AND VENUE
2 34. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to §§ 1085, 1094.5, and 187
3 of the California Code of Civil Procedure and §§ 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources

Code.
5 35. Venue for this action properly lies in the Orange County Superior Court because
6 Respondent County and the proposed site of the Project are located in Orange County.
7 THE PARTIES
8 36. Petitioner and Plaintiff PROTECT OUR HOMES AND HILLS (*POHAH") is a
9 volunteer community conservation organization consisting of citizens and taxpayers in Yorba
10 Linda that works to protect and enhance Yorba Linda's quality of life and public safety and is
11 committed to preserving the regional natural resources. Members offer input into local land use
12 decisions impacting Yorba Linda in an effort to produce better, safer development projects with
13 fewer environmental impacts. POHAH has members throughout Yorba Linda and in the wider
14 Orange County region. POHAH members will be impacted by the Project's aesthetic, biological
15 resources, geology and soils, noise, fire safety, hazards and hazardous materials, land use,
16 recreation, utilities, traffic, climate change, and cumulative impacts as they use areas surrounding
17 the Project site and impacted by the Project for residential, aesthetic, recreational, wildlife
18 viewing, and educational purposes, and intend to continue these uses. POHAH submitted timely
19 comments on the Project, the Notice of Preparation and the inadequacy of the initial Draft and
20 Final EIR, the REIR, and the SRFEIR, testified at hearings on the Project before the County
21 Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors for the initial approvals and the re-approvals.
22 POHAH and its members are directly, adversely and irreparably affected, and will continue to be
23 prejudiced by the Project and its components, as described herein, until and unless this Court
24 provides the relief prayed for in this petition. The maintenance and prosecution fthis action
25 will confer a substantial benefit on the public by protecting the public from the environmental
26 and other harms alleged herein.

2 environs of the Puente-Chino Hills and surrounding areas for the enjoyment of current and
3 succeeding generations and to initiate, sponsor, promote, organize, and carry out plans,
programs, and activities that will tend to further these ends. HFE has been dedicated to, among
5 other things, protecting the CHSP from projects that could damage the natural, visual, and
recreational functions the Park provides. HFE is organized as a California non-profit public
7 benefit corporation and works actively in four different counties and twelve different municipal
jurisdictions. Members and supporters of HFE include residents and taxpayers of the County and
9 City who will be negatively affected by the Project's adverse environmental impacts.
10 38. Petitioner and Plaintiff ENDANGERED HABITATS LEAGUE, INC. ("EHL") is
11 a tax exempt, non-profit, public interest corporation, under California law devoted to sustainable
12 land use planning in Southern California and to the preservation of its native species and the
13 ecosystems upon which these species depend for their survival. EHL submitted timely
14 comments to the County regarding the Project and the inadequacies of the initial Draft and Final
15 EIRs, the REIR and the SRFEIR. EHL's core organizational purposes, and the interest of its
16 members--many of whom reside in Orange County--are directly, adversely, and irreparably
17 affected, and will continue to be prejudiced by the Project and its components, as described
18 herein, until and unless this Court provides the relief prayed for in this petition. The
19 maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a substantial benefit on the public by
20 protecting the public from the environmental and other harms alleged herein.
21 39. Petitioner and Plaintiff FRIENDS OF HARBORS, BEACHES AND PARKS,
22 INC. ("FHBP"), is : California non-profit, 501(c)(3) corporation whose mission is to promote,

25 and community organizations in Orange County. FHBP and its coalition members work to
26 ensure the protection of important natural lands, provide educational opportunities at recreational
27 facilities, and enhance existing natural areas. FHBP has provided written comments during the
28

11 Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for
Injunctive Relief

1 administrative proceedings leading to approval of the Project. The interests that FHBP seeks to
2 further in this action are within the purposes and goals of the corporation, and FHBP and its
3 members have a direct and beneficial interest in Respondents' compliance with CEQA, the
4 CEQA Guidelines, State Planning and Zoning Law, the General Plans of Orange County and of
5 the City of Yorba Linda. These interests will be directly and adversely affected by the Project,
6 which violates provisions of law as set forth in this Petition and which would cause irreversible
7 harm to the natural environment and habitat protections. The maintenance and prosecution of
8 this action will confer a substantial benefit on the public by protecting the public from the
9 environmental and other harms alleged herein.
10 40. Respondent COUNTY OF ORANGE (County") is a local governmental agency
11 and political subdivision of the State of California charged with the authority to regulate and
12 administer land use activities within its boundaries, subject at all times to the obligations and
13 limitations of all applicable state, federal, and other laws, including CEQA, the CEQA

other non-joined parties in the Project.
2 53. Petitioners are currently unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents,
3 Does 1 through 20, inclusive, and therefore sue those parties by such fictitious names. Does
4 through 20, inclusive, are agents of County, state, or federal government who are responsible in
some manner for the conduct described in this petition, or other persons or entities presently
unknown to Petitioners who claim some legal or equitable interest in the Project that is the
subject of this action. Petitioners will amend this petition to show the true names and capacities
8 of Does through 20 when such names and capacities become known.
54. Petitioners are currently unaware of the true names and capacities of Real Parties
10 in Interest, Does 21 through 50, inclusive. Does 21 through 50, inclusive, are persons or entities
11 presently unknown to Petitioners who claim some legal or equitable interest in the Project that is
12 the subject of this action. Petitioners will amend this petition to show the true names and
13 capacities of Does 21 through 50 when such names and capacities become known.
14 _GENERAL ALLEGATIONS
15 55. The Project proposes construction of 340 single-family homes and associated
16 infrastructure on 468.9 acres in unincorporated Orange County within the Yorba Linda sphere of
17 influence. The Project will permanently impact a minimum of 331 acres of natural vegetation
18 communities, including coastal sage scrub habitat of the federally threatened Coastal California
19 Gnatcatcher. The entire Project site burned in 37 minutes in the 2008 Freeway Complex Fire
20 ("FCF"). The road to be used under the single access option (Option 1A), first rejected by the
21 County in the initial approvals, and then approved by County in May 2017, vacated in July 2018
22 and reapproved in September 2018, was subject to documented gridlock during the FCF
23 evacuation involving fewer residents.
24 56. The concerns of Supervisor Spitzer and the City which led to the deletion of
25 Option from the Specific Plan in June 2015 included not only a steep, dangerous and
26 serpentine road but also, the neighborhood impacts of residents of all 340 Project homes coupled
27 with 80 Cielo Vista homes exiting onto Stonehaven/Via de Agua. Option 1A reinstitutes these
28

15 Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 serious impacts to adjoining neighborhoods by providing a single point of ingress and egress to
2 the Project without any mitigation or avoidance.
3 57. As a result of Respondent County's approvals, Petitioners will suffer great and
4 irreparable environmental harm as described herein. Petitioners have no adequate remedy at law
5 for this irreparable harm.

58. Petitioners have exhausted all administrative remedies by submitting written
7 comments to County prior to Project approval, requesting compliance with CEQA and the
completion of full and adequate environmental review and compliance with all relevant state and
9 local laws. All issues raised in this petition were raised in a timely manner before Respondents
10 by Petitioners, other members of the public, or public agencies.
11 59. Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code § 21167.5 by prior service
12 of a notice upon County indicating their intent to file this Petition. Proof of Service of this
13 notification, with the notification attached, is attached as Exhibit A.
14 60. This petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code § 21167
15 and CEQA Guidelines § 15112.
16 61. Respondents have abused their discretion and failed to proceed in the manner
17 required by law in the following ways:
18
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
19 Violation of CEQA (Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.)
20 (By All Petitioners Against Respondents County and Board)

21 62. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth
22 above.

23 63. CEQA requires that Lead Agency must prepare a legally adequate EIR prior to
24 approving any discretionary project that may have a significant environmental effect. The EIR
25 must fully disclose and analyze the project's potentially significant environmental effects. The
26 Lead Agency is also required pursuant to CEQA to consider mitigation measures and alternatives
27 that would reduce or avoid the project's significant environmental effects, to adopt all feasible
28 mitigation measures and/or alternatives, and to determine that proposed mitigation measures will

16 Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

H

2 or will not be effective in avoiding or substantially lessening the project's significant
environmental impacts.

64. CEQA requires that an EIR must provide a complete and accurate description of

5 both the project and the project's environmental setting.

65.

6 The EIR must provide sufficient environmental analysis such that decision-
makers can intelligently consider environmental consequences when acting on proposed projects.
Mitigation measures adopted for a project's significant environmental effects must be specific
and enforceable.
9 66.
10 In approving the Project and certifying the SRFEIR, CEQA requires that County

11 must find either (1) that the project's significant environmental effects have been mitigated or

12 avoided or (2) that the unmitigated impacts are outweighed by specific overriding economic,

13 legal, social, technological, or other benefits of the project. County may reach the latter

14 conclusion and adopt a Statement of Overriding Considerations only if it finds that there are no

15 feasible mitigation measures or alternatives to avoid or substantially lessen the remaining

16 significant environmental effects of the project.

67.
17 As Lead Agency, County has a clear, present, and mandatory duty to analyze and

18 adopt all feasible mitigation measures as well as consider a reasonable range of alternatives and

19 adopt any feasible alternative that would substantially lessen the significant environmental

20 effects of the Project.

68.
21 County violated CEQA by failing to perform its statutory CEQA duties and

22 certifying the SRFEIR for the Project that is inadequate and fails to comply with CEQA for the

23 following reasons, among others:

24 County Failed to Exercise its Independent Judgment on the Access and Density
Reduction Issues.
25 69.
26 County must independently analyze the feasibility of full-time/daily secondary

27 access and, in the absence of secondary access, the feasibility of a reduced project alternative.

28

17 Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

Instead, County simply recited the representations of the Project applicant concerning full-
2 time/daily secondary access, without further inquiry or analyses.

70. County's exercise of independent judgment is critical to the validity of the
environmental review herein and the Project approval process. Any EIR "which is sent out for
public review must reflect the independent judgment of the lead agency. The lead agency is
6 responsible for the adequacy and objectivity of the ] EIR." Pub. Resources Code
7 §21082.1(c)(1)-(2); 14 Cal. Code Regs. ("CEQA Guidelines") §15084(e).
71. When certifying the SRFEIR, County must make specific findings, including one
9 that the SRFEIR reflects its independent judgment. Pub. Resources Code §21082.1(c); Friends
10 of La V. Vina v. County of Los Angeles (1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 1446, 1452-55. Such findings must
11 be supported by substantial evidence.
12 72. County has not exercised its independent judgment on the issue of secondary
13 access or a reduced density project and its findings under Pub. Resources Code §21082.1(c) are
14 not supported by substantial evidence.
15

16 County Erred in Failing to Require Additional Environmental Review or to Prepare

17 a New EIR When the Project Access Changes Revealed Potential Significant Fire Safety,

18 Air Quality, GHG Emissions, Biological and Traffic Impacts

19 73. Access Option 1A is a modification of a previous access alternative, Option 1,

20 which was deleted from the initial approvals and Specific Plan due to documented adverse

21 impacts on existing residences and safety concerns. Neither Option nor Option 1A were part

22 of the initial approvals or subject to challenge in the initial action.

23 74. Access Option 1A includes a previously unanalyzed bridge crossing the

24 biologically sensitive Blue Mud Canyon and presents a host of unanalyzed air quality, GHG,

25 biological, safety, and traffic impacts which should have been subject to additional

26 environmental review. Access Option 1A presents legal feasibility issues concerning the

27 applicants' ability to secure necessary access rights for this option. All legal entitlements for

28 access are not in place.

18 Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

75. The extent and scope of any easement rights for the Project's necessary
2 emergency access through the adjacent Cielo Vista project site have not been adjudicated,
defined and were expressly not addressed in Orange County Superior Court Case Nos. 30-2013-
00650665 and 30-2017-00934107-CU-OR-CJC or Court of Appeal Case No. G05110 as between
Real Party, Yorba Linda Estates, LLC and North County BRS Project, LLC et al., developer of
6 Cielo Vista.
7 76. Only the existence of an easement for the benefit of one of the three Esperanza
Hills Project parcels was determined, not its scope, as such issues were not considered ripe by
the trial court and this conclusion was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The issue of the Real
10 Parties' right to use the easement for non-benefitted parcels has never been judicially determined 11 and remains in question.
12 77. The approved access proposal (Option 1A) is the sixth access option proposed by
13 the applicant and is a variation of an earlier rejected access option, also connecting to
14 Stonehaven/Via del Agua. Option 1 was soundly criticized by Supervisor Spitzer and expressly
15 deleted from the initial approvals and the initial specific plan by County. There has been no
16 change in circumstances rendering this previously unsafe, unacceptable and rejected access
17 alternative, safe or acceptable.
18 78. There is substantial evidence that Option 1A may have significant fire safety
19 impacts requiring additional environmental review or a new EIR.
20 79. The SRFEIR fails to identify and analyze Project inconsistency with Orange
21 County Fire Authority ordinance provisions, Orange County Fire Authority Fire Master Plans,
22 standard planning norms and California Fire Code requirements for secondary access/two
23 vehicle access points, traffic/evacuation modeling for various density alternatives, feasibility or
24 infeasibility of secondary access, or include any justification for any exception to the secondary
25 access norms.
26 80. Orange County Fire Authority Deputy Fire Marshall Timothy Kerbrat has stated
27 in connection with a single access for a project of this size: "We would never approve those
28

19 Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 today. Right now our limit is anything over 150 homes requires a minimum of a second access."
2 (Recording Board of Supervisors Hearing September 25, 2018 at 1:33:11).
Alternatively, County Erred in Failing to Prepare a Subsequent or Supplemental
EIR When the Project Access Changes Revealed Substantial Evidence of Significant Fire
5 Safety Impacts
6 81. CEQA provides that when a public agency makes a new discretionary decision
7 regarding a project for which an EIR has already been prepared, it must prepare a subsequent or
supplemental EIR if: (a) substantial changes are proposed in the project that will require major
revisions of the EIR; (b) substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which
10 the project is being undertaken that will require major revisions in the EIR; or (c) new
11 information, that was not known, and could not have been known, at the time the EIR was
12 certified as complete, becomes available.
13 82. County's certification of the SRFEIR and related project approvals are new
14 discretionary actions regarding the Project.
15 83. After certification and vacation of the original EIR for the Project, substantial
16 changes in access and evacuation routes for the Project were proposed. The two full-time access 17 alternatives in the initial approvals were abandoned and a previously rejected single full-time
18 access alternative was adopted. The single full-time access alternative was previously rejected
19 due to documented adverse impacts on existing residences and safety concerns.
20 84. There have been significant changes in the frequency and destructiveness of
21 wildfires in California and documented difficulties in obtaining and maintaining homeowners'
22 insurance in close proximity to wildland-urban interface since the time of certification and
23 vacation of the original, vacated EIR and vacated REIR.
24 85. Under the circumstances, these significant changes necessitated and required
25 major revisions in the SRFEIR in order to address mitigation or avoidance for documented
26 significant impacts resulting from the single access alternative.
27 86. In certifying the SRFEIR, County failed to consider this Project access change and
28

20 Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

the changed access circumstances regarding the Project. County further failed to prepare a
2 subsequent or supplemental EIR to evaluate this Project change and changed circumstances as
3 required by CEQA. The County's failure to consider the Project change and changed
4 circumstances and failure to prepare a subsequent or supplemental EIR is a failure to proceed in
the manner required by law and is not supported by substantial evidence.
County Erred in Failing to Require Additional Environmental Review or to Prepare
a New EIR When the Project Access Changes Revealed Potential Significant Land Use
8 Consistency and Traffic Impacts
9 87. All legal entitlements for access through City dedicated/controlled/owned land are
10 not in place. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that implementation of
11 Option 1A requires crossing property held by and/or dedicated to the City but approval from the
12 City has not been secured.
13 88. Petitioners are further informed and believe and thereon allege that Real Party in
14 Interest, YORBA LINDA ESTATES, LLC ("YLE"), on or about September 14, 2017, filed
15 related case in this court, YORBA LINDA ESTATES, LLC v. BROCK HOME CAP YORBA
16 LINDA, Case No. 30-2017-00943728-CU-OR-CJC, concerning its right to access the City
17 dedicated/controlled/owned land.
18 89. Petitioners are further informed and believe and thereon allege that YLE did not
19 file a Notice of Related Case in connection with Case No. 30-2017-00943728-CU-OR-CJC
20 informing the court of the following related Cases in this court: Case Nos. 30-2015-00797300-
21 CU-TT-CXC; 30-2017-00934107-CU-OR-CJC; 30-2013-00650665-CU-OR-CJC; 30-2017-
22 00925230-CU-WM-CXC (consolidated with Case No. 30-2017-00925277-CU-TT-CXC).
23 90. Petitioners are further informed and believe and thereon allege that YLE did not
24 name a City as a real party in interest in Case No. 30-2017-00943728-CU-OR-CJC thereby
25 depriving City of any notice of the litigation.
26 91. Petitioners are further informed and believe and thereon allege that YLE did not
27 name the successor in interest to BROCK HOME CAP YORBA LINDA, Lennar Corporation, as
28

21 Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

-

2 a real party in interest in Case No. 30-2017-00943728-CU-OR-CJC thereby depriving Brock's

3 successor and possible current fee owner of the property in question of any notice of the
litigation.
4 92.
5 Petitioners are further informed and believe and thereon allege that on February 5,

6 2018, YLE obtained a default judgment in its favor in Case No. 30-2017-00943728-CU-OR-CJC

7 without having named City or Lennar Corporation as real parties in interest or having apprised

8 the court of the other related matters past or pending in this court.
93.
9 City indicated in a October 26, 2016 letter: "the County should require the

10 applicant to prove and show all documentation that it has legal access to all property needed

11 (including grading rights) for the primary and emergency access points prior to approving the

12 project and provide the exact locations for any proposed streets be presented and acceptable to

13 the City before the County issues any permits for this project."
94.
14 Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that County failed to

15 comply with City's request and there is no substantial evidence in support of applicant's right to

16 legal access to all property needed for the Project's primary and emergency access.
95.
17 In February 7, 2017 and September 18, 2018 letters from City to County, City

18 indicated: "In order to diffuse traffic-related impacts so that they do not overly impact particular

19 neighborhoods within the City with the full amount of new development traffic, the City requests

20 multiple primary access points to the Project…Also, the City requests that the County require the

21 Project applicant to prove and show all documentation that it has legal access to all property

22 needed (including grading rights) for primary and emergency access points prior to approving

23 the Project and provide the exact location for all proposed streets be presented and acceptable to

24 the City before the County issues any permits for this Project." City also requested that the

25 County recirculate the SRFEIR "in compliance with the requirements of CEQA" and require e

26 pre-annexation agreement.

96.
27 Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that County failed to

28 comply with City's requests and there is no substantial evidence in support of applicant's right to

22 Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

legal access to all property needed for the Project's primary and emergency access.
2 97. Legal uncertainty about an agency's ability to implement an alternative justifies a
3 determination of infeasibility. Marin Mun. Water Dist. V. KG Land Cal. Corp. (1991) 235
Cal.App.3d 1652, 1666. An alternative may be found legally infeasible if its adoption is beyond
the power conferred by law on the agency. See Habitat & Watershed Caretakers v. City of Santa
Cruz (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 1277, 1303-1304. Likewise, an alternative will be infeasible if it
7 conflicts with a relevant policy or regulatory limitation. City of Maywood v. Los Angeles Unified
8 Sch. Dist. (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 362, 416-417. Option IA suffers from these infirmities.
9 98. The necessary City approvals and any Yorba Linda General Plan or Municipal
10 Code inconsistency issues and feasibility issues in connection with Option 1A have not been
11 identified or analyzed in the SRFEIR,
12 99. The Yorba Linda General Plan ("YLGP") does not specifically identify an access
13 route to the Project site. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the City
14 controlled/dedicated property necessary for Option 1A may be part of previous mitigation or
15 conditions imposed as part of the approval process for previous developments.
16 100. Permitting the construction of a road on publically dedicated/controlled/owned
17 property to serve a private development is not be consistent with the YLGP or original City
18 development approvals.
19 101. There is substantial evidence that the single full-time access and firefighter access
20 option, Option 1A, may have significant land use consistency and traffic impacts which were not
21 addressed in the EIR, REIR, or SRFEIR and require additional environmental review or a new
22 EIR.
23 102. Alternatively, and for the reasons previously stated, in certifying the SRFEIR,
24 County failed to consider this Project change and the changed access circumstances and land use
25 consistency and traffic impacts regarding this Project change. County further failed to prepare a
26 subsequent or supplemental EIR to evaluate this Project change and changed circumstances as
27 required by CEQA. The City's failure to consider the Project change and changed circumstances
28

23 Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

and failure to prepare a subsequent or supplemental EIR is a failure to proceed in the manner
2 required by law and is not supported by substantial evidence.
3 103. County erred in failing to prepare a subsequent or supplemental EIR when the
4 Project access changes revealed substantial evidence of significant land use consistency and
5 traffic impacts.
6 County Erred in Failing to Require Additional Environmental Review or to Prepare
a New EIR When the Presence of Coastal California Gnatcatchers on the Adjacent Cielo
8 Vista Project Revealed Potential Significant Biological Impacts
9 104. New information concerning the presence of Coastal California Gnatcatchers, a
10 federally threatened species under the federal Endangered Species Act, on the adjacent Cielo
11 Vista property in jurisdictional drainages contiguous to the Project site became publically
12 available after the initial approvals and again in July 2016.
13 105. The May 2017 approvals include Project changes, including construction of a
14 previously unanalyzed bridge option over Blue Mud Canyon, where Coastal California
15 Gnatcatcher habitat exists and will be impacted by the bridge construction and which is
16 contiguous to the jurisdictional drainages on Cielo Vista where Coastal California Gnatcatchers
17 have been found.
18 106. The Project site, as well as the adjacent Cielo Vista and Bridal Hills sites, are
19 within Unit 9 of the designated Critical Habitat for the threatened Coastal California
20 Gnatcatcher. Unit 9 is described as providing "connectivity and genetic interchange among core
21 populations and contains large blocks of high-quality habitat capable of supporting persistent
22 populations of Coastal California Gnatcatchers." The Project site contains 92.02 acres of Coastal
23 California Gnatcatcher habitat in the form of coastal sage scrub ("CSS") and the project will
24 impact over 33 acres of CSS and over 65 acres of CSS/Chaparral Ecotone.
25 107. United States Fish and Wildlife Service ("USFWS") has indicated that Coastal
26 California Gnatcatchers are likely to disperse through the Project site and forage on the Project
27 site and prior to preparation of the initial, vacated EIR had been observed a mere 0.25 mile from
28

24 Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

the Project site as well as within 1.5 miles east and west of the Project site.
2 108. In July 2016, focused surveys established Coastal California Gnatcatchers were
present on the immediately adjacent Cielo Vista site in jurisdictional drainages contiguous to the
Project site.
5 109. According to USFWS, the primary function of the critical habitat is to "maintain
connectivity and genetic interchange between significant Coastal California Gnatcatcher
ipopulations in the Santa Ana Mountains and those in the Chino Puente Hills" and "small patches
of remaining habitat provide important stepping stones for continued Coastal California
9 Gnatcatcher dispersal".
10 110. The Project's impacts on this Coastal California Gnatcatcher presence on Cielo
11 Vista will further impact low elevation dispersal corridors for the Coastal California Gnatcatcher.
12 USFWS previously recommended both Cielo Vista and the Project site "include low elevation
13 corridors to maintain the function of critical habitat for Coastal California Gnatcatcher
14 dispersal".
15 111. By its extensive grading and earth movement activities, the Project will cut off
16 low elevation dispersal corridors which are plainly being used by the Coastal California
17 Gnatcatchers present on the westerly Cielo Vista property and interrupt connectivity between
18 Coastal California Gnatcatcher populations at Chino Hills State Park and Cielo Vista, with
19 Esperanza Hills in between.
20 112. Further Coastal California Gnatcatcher surveys on the Project site are necessary
21 given the species' documented presence on the adjacent Cielo Vista site. A single visit to the site
22 was conducted outside of the appropriate time of the year, without the recommended minimum
23 number of surveys at the suggested frequency as recommended by the USFWS
24 Presence/Absence Survey Protocol for the Coastal California Gnatcatcher. The single visit to the
25 Blue Mud Canyon area by the County's consultant is inadequate and does not support the
26 County's conclusions regarding Coastal California Gnatcatcher presence or potential Project
27 impacts to Coastal California Gnatcatchers or their habitat on the Project site as a whole.
28

25 Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 113. There is substantial evidence that the Project may have significant impacts to
2 Coastal California Gnatcatchers and their habitat on the Project site and related edge effects on
3 Gnatcatchers present on the Cielo Vista site requiring additional environmental review or a new
EIR and mitigation and avoidance.
5 Alternatively, County Erred in Failing to Prepare a Subsequent or Supplemental
6 EIR When the Presence of Coastal California Gnatcatchers on the Adjacent Cielo Vista
Project Revealed Substantial Evidence of New Significant Biological Impacts
8 114. New information, which was not known and could not have been known at the
9 time of the initial approvals and EIR thereon, concerning the presence of Coastal California
10 Gnatcatchers on the adjacent Cielo Vista property in jurisdictional drainages contiguous to the
11 Project site became available in July 2016.
12 115. In July 2016, new information in the form of focused surveys established Coastal
13 California Gnatcatchers were present on the immediately adjacent Cielo Vista site in
14 jurisdictional drainages contiguous to the Project site.
15 116. This new information concerning Coastal California Gnatcatcher presence and
16 impacts falls squarely within Public Resources Code section 21166 triggers for preparation of a
17 subsequent or supplemental EIR. The information was not known and could not have been
18 known at the time the EIR for the initial approvals was certified.
19 117. By its extensive grading and earth movement activities, the Project will cut off
20 low elevation dispersal corridors which are plainly being used by the Coastal California
21 Gnatcatchers present on the westerly Cielo Vista property and interrupt connectivity between
22 Coastal California Gnatcatchers populations at Chino Hills State Park and Cielo Vista, with
23 Esperanza Hills in between.
24 118. The Project will therefore have significant effects not evaluated in the prior EIR,
25 the REIR or SRFEIR and/or significant effects previously examined will be substantially more
26 severe than shown in the prior EIRs. See CEQA Guidelines section 15162. The County should
27 require preparation of a supplemental or subsequent EIR.
28

26 Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 119. Further Coastal California Gnatcatcher surveys on the Project site are necessary
2 given the species' documented presence on the adjacent Cielo Vista site. A single visit to the site
3 was conducted outside of the appropriate time of the year, without the recommended minimum
4 number of surveys at the suggested frequency as recommended by the USFWS
5 Presence/Absence Survey Protocol for the Coastal California Gnatcatcher. The single visit to the
6 Blue Mud Canyon area by the County's consultant is inadequate and does not support the
7 County's conclusions regarding Coastal California Gnatcatcher presence or potential Project
8 impacts to Coastal California Gnatcatchers or their habitat on the total Project site or related edge
9 effects on Gnatcatchers present on the Cielo Vista site.
10 County Erred in Failing to Require Additional Environmental Review or to Prepare
11 a New EIR Upon Significant Revisions to the Adjacent Cielo Vista Project Revealed
12 Potential Significant Biological Edge Effects and Fire Hazard Impacts
13 120. Since the REIR for the Project was completed, the adjacent Cielo Vista project
14 has undergone a significant revision in size and scope. As originally proposed, the entire parcel
15 to the west of the Project was proposed for development. However, as approved by County in
16 December 2016, the northern 41 acres of Cielo Vista will be preserved as protected habitat. The
17 biological resources in this protected open space on Cielo Vista will now be subject to significant
18 edge effects not evaluated in the EIR, REIR or SRFEIR. In addition, the Project will now be
19 surrounded by wildland-urban interface on its western, northern and eastern borders.
20 121. There is substantial evidence that the Project may have significant impacts to
21 biological open space on the Cielo Vista site and increased fire hazard dangers to the Project
22 residents requiring additional environmental review or a new EIR.
23 Alternatively, County Erred in Failing to Prepare a Subsequent or Supplemental
24 EIR When Cielo Vista project changes Revealed Substantial Evidence of New Significant
25 Environmental Impacts
26 122. In December 2016, new information became available concerning newly
27 protected open space on the adjacent Cielo Vista site. Instead of being bounded by urban
28

27 Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

development to the west, the Project will now be surrounded by protected open space and
2 wildland-urban interface on its western, northern and eastern borders resulting in edge effects
and environmental impacts never evaluated in the EIR, REIR or SRFEIR.

123. This new information concerning maintenance of the wildland-urban interface,
protected habitat and open space and concomitant significant edge effect of the Project on this
6 protected land and increased fire hazard dangers to the Project residents fall squarely within
7 Public Resources Code section 21166 triggers for preparation of a subsequent or supplemental
8 EIR. The information was not known and could not have been known at the time the EIR for the
9 initial approvals was certified.
10 124. The project will therefore have significant effects not evaluated in the prior EIR,
11 the REIR or SRFEIR and/or significant effects previously examined will be substantially more
12 severe than shown in the prior EIRs. See CEQA Guidelines section 15162. The County should
13 require preparation of a supplemental or subsequent EIR.
14 County Failed to Proceed in a Manner Required by Law and Its Findings and
15 Conclusions Are Unsupported by Substantial Evidence
16 125. As approved, the SRFEIR: fails to provide adequate impact analysis or mitigation
17 as it relates to Project impacts to CHSP, including but not limited to, edge effects on the park;
18 fails to provide adequate impact analysis or feasible avoidance or mitigation for significant
19 impacts in the following areas: aesthetics, biological resources, noise, fire safety, hazards and
20 hazardous materials, land use, recreation, utilities (water demands), traffic; impermissibly defers
21 mitigation for fire hazards and biological impacts; and is inadequate as an informational
22 document. The SRFEIR fails to provide a reasonable range of alternatives, including a reduced
23 density alternative with a single point of egress. The SRFEIR fails to provide adequate
24 responses to public comments.
25 126. This Petition and the challenges raised herein are without waiver of issues
26 asserted in and at issue in related Case No. 30-2015-00797300-CU-TT-CXC, any return to the

28 Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

1 Supplemental writ or Motion to Discharge the Supplemental Writ in the afore-mentioned case or
2 any issues currently on appeal in Court of Appeal Case No. G055716.
3 County's Decision Regarding Recirculation is Not Supported by Substantial
4 Evidence
5 127. An agency is required to recirculate an EIR when significant new information is
6 added after circulation of the draft EIR but before certification of the final EIR. CEQA
7 Guidelines §15088.5. New information is significant if it "deprives the public of a meaningful
8 opportunity to comment upon a substantial adverse environmental effect of the project or a
9 feasible way to mitigate or avoid such an effect (including a feasible project alternative) that the
10 project's proponents have declined to implement." Id at (a)(3).
11 128. While County has held hearings for the SRFEIR and project approvals, these
12 hearings are not equivalent to CEQA public notice and comment periods. Most seriously, these
13 hearings do not provide responsible, trustee and local agency consultation and comments (Pub.
14 Resources Code $§21104, 21104.2, 21153), required time periods for public review (Pub.
15 Resources Code §21091(a)) or serve the fundamental public participation and informational
16 purposes of CEQA's formal public comment and review procedures (CEQA Guidelines
17 §§15200, 15201, 15204). The process undertaken by the County in again avoiding proper public
18 and agency review of a document found inadequate not once, but twice by the courts invites post
19 hoc rationalization of decisions, fails to take a hard look at this project and its host of significant,
20 unmitigated impacts and violates CEQA.
21 129. Circulation of the SRFEIR was required and County's decision not to circulate the
22 SRFEIR for public review and comment is not supported by substantial evidence.
23

24 County's Statement of Overriding Considerations Is Not Supported By Substantial

25 Evidence.

26 130. Where no feasible mitigation measures or alternatives are available to avoid or

27 reduce a project's significant environmental effects, CEQA allows an agency approving a project

28 to adopt a Statement of Overriding Considerations that describes how specific overriding

29 Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

economic, legal, social, technological, or other benefits outweigh the significant environmental
2 effects.

131. In approving the Project and certifying the SRFEIR, the Board concluded that the
Project would result in significant unavoidable Greenhouse Gas, Noise and
Traffic/Transportation impacts. Accordingly, the Board adopted a Statement of Overriding
6 Considerations, including findings that specific considerations make infeasible the mitigation
7 measures or alternatives identified in the SRFEIR for the Project's unavoidable significant
impacts and that economic, social, and other factors justify approval of the Project despite these
unavoidable significant impacts.
10 132. The County's adoption of a Statement of Overriding Considerations that
11 purportedly justifies the Project's significant adverse impacts on the environment is not
12 supported by substantial evidence and represents a failure to proceed in the manner required by
13 law. Similarly, the finding that no feasible alternatives or mitigation measures exist to eliminate
14 or reduce the remaining significant effects is not supported by substantial evidence.
15 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
16 Violation of Planning and Zoning Law (Gov. Code §65000 et seq.),
17 Subdivision Map Act (Gov. Code $66499.37), Orange County Subdivision Code; Administrative Mandamus - Code of Civ. Proc. $1094.5
18 (By All Petitioners Against Respondents County and Board)

19 133. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth

20 above.

21 134. California Planning and Zoning law requires local agencies to ensure consistency

22 among their land use planning documents and individual project approvals. Gov. Code §§ 65454,

23 65455. No tentative map or parcel map may be approved unless it is consistent with the General

24 Plan and any applicable Specific Plan. The Subdivision Map Act and the County's Subdivision

25 Code likewise require local agencies to make specific findings before approving a map such as

26 VTTM 17522. Gov. Code §g 66473.5, 66474; Orange County Subdivision Code §§ 7-9-255, 7-

27 9-256, 7-9-291.

28 135. County prejudicially abused its discretion when it adopted the September 2018

30 Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

approvals, it did not proceed in a manner required by Planning and Zoning Law and the
2 Subdivision Map Act, its decision was not supported by the findings and the findings are not
supported by the evidence.
4 136. Due to the foregoing CEQA violations in the SRFEIR and its MMRP, unresolved
5 issues concerning the scope of Yorba Linda Estates, LLC's easement rights for the necessary
6 emergency access through Cielo Vista, uncertainty regarding adequate evacuation routes for the
7 Project, uncertainty regarding the applicant's right to use City land for the most recent access
8 iteration (Option 1A), and unresolved issues concerning the applicant's right to perform off-site
9 grading, among others, the following tentative map findings as contained in Board Resolution
10 dated September 25, 2018 Approving Vesting Tentative Tract Map 17522, are not supported by
11 substantial evidence: (1) Findings under Subdivision Code Sections 7-9-255 - 4 (Project Level
12 EIR), 5 (Development Type), 6 (Development Density), 7 (NCCP), 8 (Public Health), 9 (Public
13 Easements).
14 137. VTTM 17522 is inconsistent with the Esperanza Hills Specific Plan and findings
15 under Specific Plan Section 13.3 - 1 (Permission to Gain Access Across Land Not Owned by the
16 Project Applicant), 2 (Permission to Allow for Off-Site Grading), 3 (Consistency with EIR), and
17 4 (Consistency with MMRP) are not supported by substantial evidence.
18 138. There is no substantial evidence in support of County's findings:
19 a) That all legal entitlements for primary or secondary access to public roads are in place
20 or that permission for off-site grading has been secured;
21 b) That VTTM 17522 is not likely to cause substantial environmental damage or
22 substantially and avoidably injure fish or wildlife or their habitat;
23 C) Approving VTTM 17522 with three deviations from County standards of design
24 relating to grades and centerline radius.
25 139. County prejudicially abused its discretion in approving VTTM 17522 in conflict
26 with the Specific Plan, in violation of Planning and Zoning Law, the Subdivision Map Act, and
27 the County's Subdivision Code. Accordingly, the approval of VTTM 17522 must be set aside.
