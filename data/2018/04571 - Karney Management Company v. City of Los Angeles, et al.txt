VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

INTRODUCTION

2 1. On or about February 7, 2018, Respondent CITY OF LOS ANGELES (*City")

3 approved development entitlements including a Conditional Use Permit, Site Plan Review and a
Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND") for an out-of-scale, incompatible and illegal 155-foot

5 high office building at 12531-12575 West Beatrice Street, 5410-5454 South Jandy Place in the

6 Playa Vista neighborhood on the Westside area of Los Angeles ("the Project").

7 2. In approving the Project, the City inexplicably found that the Project, which is ten

8 stories tall and which is 135 feet in height plus a 20 foot mechanical room (the equivalent of two

9 stories on top of 135 feet, making it a 155-foot building) is compatible with the scale and
10 character of the properties adjacent to the Project, all of which are single story, and the

11 surrounding neighborhood which is similarly comprised of low height, light industrial, creative

12 office uses one to three stories in height.

13 3. What's more. despite substantial and overwhelming evidence that the Project

14 would have substantial adverse effects on aesthetics, air quality, cultural resources, geology and
15 soils, greenhouse gas emissions, hazards and hazardous materials, land use and planning, noise,

16 and transportation/traffic, the City found that an MND was the appropriate environmental

17 clearance for the Project under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA").

18 4. As set forth herein, the City's findings and analysis with regard to the MND are

19 not only woefully lacking, and disregarded evidence including credible expert evidence, that

20 under CEQA the City should have a required a full and complete Environmental Impact Report

21 ("EIR") for the Project.

22 5. For all of the reasons set forth herein, the City's actions in approving the Project,

23 and adopting the MND for the Project are not just unsupported by substantial evidence and law,
24 the City's actions also violated several of the City's own Municipal Code ("LAMC") provisions
25 and State law.

26 6. Accordingly, the City's approvals of the Project, including the MND, should be

27 set aside.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

STATEMENT OF FACTS
17. The Project is proposed to be located on the corner of West Beatrice Street and
South Jandy Place, on an approximately 4.52-acre property comprised of five separate legal lots,
in the Playa Vista neighborhood on the Westside of Los Angeles, immediately across the street

5 from a residential apartment development called Avalon Playa Vista.
18. Both of the streets on which the Project fronts, West Beatrice and South Jandy, are

7 small, cul-de-sac streets.

8 19. Jandy Place is an approximately 400-foot long cul-de-sac street which is congested

9 most of the day, serving as the sole access to four of the five office buildings owned by Petitioner,

10 including at 5404, 5405 and 5415 Jandy Place and 12615 Beatrice Street.

11 20. Beatrice Street is slightly longer than Jandy Place, but is aiso a small cul-de-sac

12 street which intersects Jandy Place at its mid-point, is similarly congested from existing
13 development.
24 21. The Project site is zoned "M-2," which stands for "Light Industrial Zone" under

15 the LAMC. It is bounded on all sides by other M-2 zoned properties, with the Avalon Playa Vista

16 residential development facing Jefferson Boulevard being the only exception.
22. With the same zoning, all of the adjacent and surrounding M-2 properties to the

18 Project have a very distinct underlying developmental pattern, they are all improved with low-

19 height, light industrial, creative office uses which are one to three stories in height. Indeed, all of
20 the properties immediately adjacent to the Project site are improved with only single-story
21 industrial or creative office buildings.

22 23. The Project site is currently improved with two creative uses, a 23,072-square-foot

23 office building, accessory structures and surface parking at 12575 Beatrice Street (Lots 20 and 21

24 of Tract 30549) and an 87,881 square-foot office building located 12541 Beatrice Street (Lots 17,

25 18 and 19 or Tract 30549).

26 24. The Project proposes demolition/removal of all existing on-site structures at 12575
27 Beatrice; retention of the office building at 12541 Beatrice Street; and construction of an

28

-S-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 additional 1 55-foot tall office building with associated parking, landscaping and hardscape at both

2 properties.

3 25. On or about April 7, 2016, Real Parties filed an application in Case No. CPC-

4 2016-1208-CU-SPR with the City's Department of City Planning (*Planning Department")

5 seeking various entitlements required by law to develop the Project. Real Parties' application

6 included entitlement requests for (i) Site Plan Review for a development project that results in an

7 increase of 50,000 gross square feet of non-residential floor area; (ii) a Conditional Use for a

8 "Major" development project under LAMC $12.24.U.14; (iii) a Conditional Use for floor area

9 ratio averaging under LAMC §12.24.W.19; and (iv) "additional actions as may be determined

10 necessary."

11 26. Real Parties thereafter modified the scope of the Project and filed a revised

12 application which eliminated the request for a Conditional Use for floor area ratio averaging under
13 LAMC § 12.24.W.19.

14 27. As set forth in more detail hereinbelow, Petitioner is informed, believes and
15 thereon alleges that despite the modified scope of the Project, Real Parties were required to obtain

16 a Conditional Use for floor area ratio averaging under LAMC § 12.24. W.19 in order to obtain all

17 required entitlements and City approvals to construct the Project, as proposed.

18 28. On or about February 1, 2017, Real Parties also filed a separate application in Case

19 No. AA-2017-397-PMEX seeking a lot line adjustment within the five contiguous lots comprising

20 the Project site ("Lot Line Adjustment").
29. Petitioner is informed, believes and thereon alleges that the Lot Line Adjustment

22 was filed in an attempt to evade and circumvent the "Commercial Corner" development standards

23 and requirements set forth in the LAMC to which the Project is subject (most notably the 45-foot

24 height limitation).

25 30. As of the filing of this Petition, the City has not approved or taken any action on

26 Real Parties' requested Lot Line Adjustment.

27 31. On or about April 20, 2017, the Planning Department, prepared an Initial Study

28 and Checklist for the Project, as required by CEQA. In the Initial Study, the Planning Department

-6-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 identified many substantive environmental issues of which the Project had the potential to

2 negatively impact the environment, including aesthetics, cultural resources, geology and soils,

3 noise, transportation/traffic, and tribal resources. The Planning Department determined, however,
that although the Project could have a significant effect on the environment, there would not be a

S significant effect in this case because of revisions to the Project made by, or agreed to by, the

6 Real Parties, and that, therefore, only a Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND") was required.

7 32. On or about June 6, 2017, a Hearing Officer of the Planning Department, on behalf

8 of the City Planning Commission, held a public hearing to take testimony regarding the Project.

9 Many concerned members of the public and surrounding business owners and operators,

10 including Petitioner, appeared and testified against the Project, its many adverse impacts; the fact

11 that the legal findings for the Project could not be made with supporting substantial evidence; that

12 the Project's approval violated both state and City laws; and that the proposed MND was

13 inadequate under CEQA.

14 33. After taking testimony, the Hearing Officer closed the public hearing.

15 34. Subsequently, and despite the numerous concerns raised by the public, including

16 Petitioner, at the June 6, 2017 hearing, the Planning Department made a recommendation to the

17 City Planning Commission to adopt the MND; approve Site Plan Review; and approve a

18 Conditional Use for a "Major" development for the Project.

19 35. On or about July 27, 2017, the City Planning Commission met to consider the
20 Project. Again, numerous concerned members of the public, including Petitioner, appeared and

21 testified against the Project, its many adverse impacts and the inadequacy of the proposed MND.

22 36. After taking testimony and closing the public hearing, the City Planning

23 Commission approved the Project, including the adoption of the MND; approval of Site Plan

24 Review; and approval of a Conditional Use for a "Major" development project.

25 37. On or about August 18, 2017, the City Planning Commission issued Letters of
26 Determination regarding its July 27, 2017 actions.

27 38. On or about September 5, 2017, Petitioner timely filed an appeal of the City

28 Planning Commission's actions to the City Council. In the appeal, among other issues, Petitioner

-7-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 again contended that the proposed MND was inadequate as a matter of law; that the findings for

2 the required entitlements could not be made with supporting substantial evidence; and that the

3 Project's approval violated both State and City laws.
4 39. On or about October 25, 2017, the Planning and Land Use Management

5 Committee ("PLUM Committee"), a standing committee of the City Council, considered

6 Petitioner's appeal. Petitioner, through counsel, appeared and testified against the Project, its

7 many adverse impacts, the inadequacy of the MND and the Project's violations of State and City

8 laws.

40. After taking testimony and closing the public hearing, the PLUM Committee
10 recommended that the full City Council adopt the MND and deny Petitioner's appeal thereby

11 sustaining the decision of the City Planning Commission to approve all of the Project

12 entitlements.

13 41. On or about February 7, 2018, the City Council adopted the PLUM Committee's

14 report and recommendation without further public hearing.

15 42. On or about February 9, 2018, the City Clerk transferred the Project file to the

16 Mayor's Office, as required by LAMC $12.24.

43. On or about February 9, 2018, the Mayor approved the City Council's action.

18 44. The City's actions, as set forth hereinabove, constitute a final action of the City to

19 approve the Project and adopt the MND.

20 45. As set forth above, Petitioner objected to the Project entitlements and proposed

21 MND during the administrative process, including submitting letters, filing appeals and testifying
22 during public hearings, thereby exhausting of its administrative remedies.

23 46. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
24  unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate and injunctive relief.

25 47. Unless the City and Real Parties are restrained and enjoined from the issuance of

26 grading and building permits as well as any construction of the Project before the Court's

great and 27 determination on the merits in this action, Petitioner and the general public will suffer

28 irreparable harm. Without injunctive relief, Petitioner would be denied its rightful remedies if

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 the Project was allowed to proceed with development and thereafter the Court determines that the

2 MND and Project approvals shall be set aside on any of the grounds asserted herein.

3 48. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code $21167.5 by providing the

4 City with notice of intention to commence the within action. [Exhibit A hereto].

5 49. Petitioner requests that Respondents prepare the administrative record [Exhibit B

6 bereto].

7 FIRST CAUSE OF AÇTION

8 VIOLATIONS OF CEQA - INADEQUATE MND

9 50. Petitioner repeats, realleges and incorporates by reference each and every
10 allegation contained in Paragraphs 1-49, inclusive, as though fully set forth herein.

11 51. CEQA, as set forth in Public Resources Code §§21000-21177, was enacted to

12 ensure that the long-term protection of the environment, consistent with the provision of a decent

13 home and suitable living environment for every Californian, shall be the guiding criterion for

14 public decisions.

15 52. CEQ requires that prior to approval of any discretionary project, the environmental

16 effects of that project be evaluated on the existing environment.

17 53. CEQA requires strict compliance with the procedures and mandates of the statute.

18 54. CEQA is not merely a procedural statute. It imposes clear and substantive

19 responsibilities on agencies that propose to approve projects, requiring such agencies not to

20 approve projects that harm the environment unless and until all feasible mitigation measures are

21 employed to minimize that harm.

22 55. Failure to comply with the substantive requirements of CEQA or to carry out the

23 full CEQA procedures so that complete information of a project's impacts is developed and

24 publicly disclosed constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion that requires invalidation of the

25 public agency action regardless of whether full compliance would have produced a different
26 result.

27

28

-9-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 56. In taking the actions set forth herein, including the determination that the Project's

2 approvals may rely on an MND, rather than a full and complete EIR, the City has erred and/or

3 abused its discretion by failing to proceed in the manner required by CEQA.

4 57. Specifically, the MND fails to integrate its environmental analysis with all of the

5 planning and environmental review procedures required under the City's own LAMC, thereby

6 deferring environmental review.

7 58. The MND fails to provide consistent, complete, accurate and up-to-date
e information, thwarting the stated purpose and intent of the statute to provide information of all of
the Project's impacts to the public and decision-makers, therefore facilitating informed decision-

10 making. The MND's failure to utilize consistent and accurate information also altered the actual

11 environmental impacts of the Project, as presented to the public and decision-makers. In

12 numerous sections, the MND fails to provide a sufficient level of detail or explanation in order to

13 adequately inform the public and decision-makers of impacts actually identified and provides

14 skewed or exaggerated data in order to conclude a "less than significant" impact.

15 59. The MND further fails to provide an accurate Project description, environmental

16 setting section and fails to analyze environmental impacts identified during the administrative

17 process and in past environmental documents for the Project site and surrounding areas.

18 60. The MND fails to analyze environmental impacts in accordance with the CEQA
19 statute, Guidelines and the City's own CEQA Thresholds Guide.

20 61. The MND ignores the substantial evidence that the Project, as proposed, may

21 and/or will bave significant environmental impacts including on aesthetics, air quality, cultural

22 resources, geology and soils, greenhouse gas emissions, hazards and hazardous materials, land

23 use and planning, noise, and transportation/traffic, requiring the preparation of an EIR.

24 62. The MND fails to substantiate its findings and conclusions with substantial

25 evidence. Indeed, the MND contains numerous errors, inconsistencies, omissions, incorrect
26 assumptions and conclusions.

27 63. The MND fails to utilize an adequate baseline, thereby failing to compare the

28 Project's impacts with existing conditions.

-10-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 64. The MND fails to impose mitigation measures which will reduce potential impacts

2 identified to a less than significant level, fails to impose mitigation measures the effectiveness of

3 which are supported by substantial evidence, improperly relies on regulatory measures alone to

4 find "less than significant impact," and imposes unenforceable mitigation measures.

5 65. The MND fails to provide an adequate cumulative impacts analysis.

6 66. The administrative record reflects credible evidence of a "fair argument" as to the
7 above-referenced potential and/or actual environmental effects from the Project which, as a matter

8 of law, renders the MND inadequate and which requires an EIR.

9 67. For all of these reasons, the actions of the City in approving the Project based upon

10 the MND constitute error and an abuse of discretion, not supported by substantial evidence, and

11 warrant a writ of mandamus setting aside the MND and the Project approvals.

12 68. As a result of the City's CEQA violations, Petitioner, other members of the public,

13 and City decision-makers have been harmed, and will continue to be harmed unless this Court

14 grants the requested relief, as they were not fully informed about the significant environmental

15 impacts of the Projects prior to the City's approval of the Project and adoption of the MND.

16 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

17 CUP FINDINGS NOT SUPPORTED BY SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE

18 69. Petitioner repeats, realleges and incorporates by reference each and every

19 allegation contained in Paragraphs 1-49, inclusive, as though fully set forth herein.

20 70. In taking action on any discretionary project, including the within Project, the City

21 must proceed in accordance with law, provide fair hearing, and support its decision with findings

22 which are supported by substantial evidence.

23 71. Here, the City's actions in approving the Project were arbitrary and capricious and

24 an abuse of discretion because, among other reasons, the City's findings are not supported by
25 substantial evidence.

26 72. Pursuant to the LAMC, in order to grant a Conditional Use for a Major
27 Development Project, the City must find that the Project provides for an arrangement of uses,

28

-11-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 buildings, structures, open spaces and other improvements that are compatible with the scale and

2 character of the adjacent properties and surrounding neighborhood.

73. Similarly, to grant Site Plan Review, the LAMC requires the City to find that the
Project consists of an arrangement of buildings and structures (including height, bulk and

5 setbacks), off-street parking facilities, loading areas, lighting, landscaping, trash collection, and

6 other such pertinent improvements, that is or will be compatible with existing and future

7 development on adjacent properties and neighboring properties.

8 74. Here, the prevailing scale and character of the adjacent properties and surrounding

9 neighborhood surrounding the Project site is that of low-height, light industrial, creative office

10 uses. Indeed, the majority of the surrounding uses are buildings which are one to three stories in

11 height, and all adjacent properties are single story industrial buildings.

12 75. Accordingly, there is no evidence, let alone substantial evidence, to support the

13 finding that the Project, which is ten stories tall and 135 feet in height plus a 20-foot mechanical

14 room (the equivalent of two stories on top of 135 feet, making it a 155-foot building), and which

15 will have all of the adverse impacts identified by Petitioner and surrounding business owners, will

16 be compatible with the scale and character of the adjacent properties and surrounding

17 neighborhood. Indeed, all evidence is to the contrary. The City's findings are completely

18 unsupported by substantial evidence.
THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

20 VIOLATIONS OF STATE AND CITY LAW

21 76. Petitioner repeats, realleges and incorporates by reference each and every

22 allegation contained in Paragraphs 1-48, inclusive, as though fully set forth herein.

23 77. Again, in taking action on any discretionary project, including the within Project,

24 the City must proceed in accordance with law.

25 78. Here, in approving the Project the City has violated other LAMC provisions and

26 also the Subdivision Map Act.

27 79. Specifically, as set forth hereinabove, the Project is located directly across Beatrice

28 Street from the Avalon Playa Vista residential apartments and is therefore a "Commercial Corner"

-12-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 under the LAMC. Under the LAMC Commercial Corner regulations, the Project is limited to a

2 height of 45 feet.

3 80. Here, despite the LAMC Commercial Corner provisions, the City approved the

4 within Project at 155 feet (135 feet under the LAMC plus a 20-foot high mechanical room), in

5 violation of its own Code.

6 81. Similarly, LAMC § 12.24. W.19 requires an entitlement for "floor area averaging"
whenever a building on each individual parcel or lot would exceed the permitted floor area ratio

8 on that parcel or lot, but when calculated as whole, the unified development under review before

9 the City does not.

10 82. Here, the Project proposes a 199,500 square foot building on the 12575 Beatrice
11 Street lot which will be expanded to 103,353 square feet. Accordingly, as to that lot, the FAR will

12 be 1.93, which exceeds the allowable 1.5:1 FAR limit, requiring either a reduction in floor area

13 or "floor area averaging."

83. By approving the Project without requiring "floor area averaging," the City acted

15 in violation of its own Code.

16 84. LAMC § 12.36.B further requires applicants to file all applications for all approvals

17 reasonably related to complete the project at the same time.

18 85. Here, in addition to the entitlements proposed, the Project will also need at least a

19 Conditional Use Permit for beer and wine to operate the anticipated bar and restaurant use; a haul

20 route; a lot tie; and, per the Project's own application documents, "additional actions as

21 determined necessary."

22 86. By approving the Project without requiring applications for all approvals

23 reasonably related to complete the Project, the City acted in violation of its own Code.

24 87. Furthermore. the California Subdivision Map Act limits lot line adjustments to
25 those existing between four or fewer existing adjoining parcels.

26 88. Here, the Real Parties propose a Lot Line Adjustment to adjust a line within five
27 contiguous lots. Accordingly, approval of the Project based upon the Lot Line Adjustment
