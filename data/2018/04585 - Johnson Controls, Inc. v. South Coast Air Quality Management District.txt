2 explained in detail in this Writ and Complaint, the District prepared an environmental document

3 analyzing the impacts of a different set of amendments to Rule 1111 than the District actually

4 proposed for adoption. This means that the District did not prepare any CEQA document analyzing

5 the environmental impacts of the amendments that the District adopted. Furthermore, the District

6 improperly piecemealed its CEQA analysis by excluding the integrally related rebate program - a
7 program the District expressly stated was a "companion" to the Project -- from its analysis. The

8 District also lacks authority to impose a "mitigation" fee for the purpose of generating general
revenue for the District. For these reasons and for all the reasons identified herein, the District's

10 actions violated CEQA and this Court should direct the District to conduct a new, compliant CEQA

11 analysis, including providing a public comment period and holding a hearing, and analyzing the

12 impacts, alternatives, and mitigation measures for amendments to Rule 1111.

13 INTRODUCTION

14 3. The District's Rule 1111 regulates the emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) from

15 residential furnaces. On March 2, 2018, the District adopted amendments to Rule 1111. This writ

16 and complaint challenges the legal adequacy of District's environmental analysis and the ability of
17 the district to impose a general revenue fee.

18 4. As explained more fully herein, the amendments imposed a new fee on the sale of
19 non-compliant furnaces. The District has amended Rule 1111 several times and has repeatedly set

20 ambitious NOx emissions rates, which furnace manufacturers have been unable to achieve. The

21 District has permitted non-compliant furnaces to be sold in the District if the manufacturer paid a

22 "mitigation fee" on the sale of each non-compliant furnace. The recent amendments to Rule 1111

23 establish the fee.

24 5. The District failed to perform a CEQA-compliant environmental review before

25 adopting the amendments to Rule 1111.

26 6. to CEQA requires public agencies to analyze potentially significant environmental

27 impacts of proposed projects and a range of reasonable alternatives and to identify and implement

28 mitigation for significant impacts. CEQA further requires that the public be made aware of the
2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 project, the potential impacts and mitigation to allow for public comments. The Lead Agency is to

2 review and respond to the public comments and provide all of this information to the agency

3 decision-makers and the public. The District failed to comply with CEQA by (1) failing to analyze

4 the version of Rule 1111 that the District adopted and not properly analyzing the potential significant

5 environmental impacts of amendments to Rule 1111; (2) segmenting its analysis to exclude a
6 forthcoming rebate program; (3) failing to analyze potential mitigation measures; (4) failing to

7 analyze an adequate range of alternatives; and (5) relying upon information that was not provided to

8 the public with sufficient time to comment. Additionally, the District lacks authority to impose the

9 fee established by Rule 1111. The District's justification for the imposition of a "mitigation fee" is
10 insufficient, as the District stated that the potentially adverse environmental impacts arising from the

11 sale of non-complying furnaces "cannot be mitigated." Therefore, the District is imposing a

12 "mitigation" fee that has the primary purpose of generating revenue and therefore is improper. The
13 fundamental purposes of CEQA-public participation and an assessment of potentially significant
14 environmental impacts of a proposed projecthave been defcated by the District's actions.

15 PARTIES

16 7. JCI is multinational company with its domestic principal place of business in

Respondents/Defendants Does 1-20 are also responsible, in whole or in part, for the District's failure

2 to comply with required rulemaking procedures and applicable state laws. When the true identifies

3 and capacities of these Respondents/Defendants have been determined, Petitioner/Plaintiff will, with

4 leave of the Court if necessary, amend this Petition and Complaint to insert such identifies and
capacities.

6 REGULATORY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

7 12. The District's Rule 1111 - Reduction of NOx Emissions from Natural-Gas-Fired,

8 Fan-Type Central Furnaces was adopted in December 1978 and has been amended several times.

9 13. In November 2009, Rule 1111 was amended to establish a more stringent NOx

10 emission limit of 14 nanograms per joule (ng/J), and required the four major categories of residential

11 furnaces - condensing (high efficiency), non-condensing (standard), weatherized, and mobile home
12 heating units - to meet the emission limit by specific dates.

13 14. In these same amendments to Rule 1111, the District also created a financial incentive

14 a rebate program within Rule 1111 - for manufacturers to achieve early compliance with the 14

15 ng/J NOx emission. Manufacturers that delivered and sold compliant furnaces were eligible to

16 receive a rebate payment from the District. The District allocated 3 million dollars for this rebate

17 incentive.

18 15. Original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") were unable to meet the NOx emissions

19 limits established in 2009, and Rule 1111 allowed OEMs to sell non-compliant furnaces if the OEM

20 paid a mitigation fee to the District. All OEMs had been selling non-compliant furnaces and

21 submitting mitigation fees to the District.

22 16. In September 2014, the District amended Rule 1111 again to delay the compliance

23 dates for the emission limit of 14 ng/J for all four categories of furnaces.

24 17. The 2014 amendments retained both the mitigation fee and the rebate program

25 incentive for manufacturers in Rule 1111.

26 18. In 2017, the District decided to amend Rule 1111 again because some OEMs stated

27 that they could now manufacture furnaces that achieved the 14ng/J standard.

28

4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

19. In October 2017, the District prepared Proposed Amended Rule 1111 ("2017 PAR

2 1111"), which would extend the compliance date for the four categories of furnaces to achieve

3 compliance with 14 ng/J while also increasing the mitigation fee for non-compliant furnaces.

4 Importantly, and for the first time, 2017 PAR 1111 deleted the Rule 1111 rebate program and

5 proposed separating it into a separate, but a "linked" program of the District. 2017 PAR 1111 also

6 would increase the mitigation fee from $150 for each non condensing, weatherized, or mobile home

7 furnace and $200 for each condensing furnace to $400 for all non-compliant furnaces to pay for, in

8 part, the now piecemealed rebate program, and extend the dates for complying with the NOx limit

9 for all four categories of furnaces:

10 a. October 1, 2019 for condensing furnaces;

11 b. October 1, 2019 for non-condensing furnaces;

12 c. October 1, 2020 for weatherized furnaces; and

13 d. October 1, 2022 for mobile home furnaces.

14 20. In December 2017, the District released a Draft Subsequent Environmental
15 Assessment ("SEA") to evaluate the potential adverse environmental impacts of adopting 2017 PAR
16 1111. In the SEA, the District acknowledged that 2017 PAR 1111 is considered a "project" under
17 CEQA and that it would create a rebate program, which is a "separate action" from the rule
18 amendment even though a rebate was formerly an integral part of Rule 1111.
19 21. In the SEA, the District stated that, in addition to proposing a fee increase to

20 incentivize early conversion to compliant furnaces, it may also institute a rebate program, "which is
21 separate action from the rule amendment." Elsewhere in the SEA, the District reiterated this by

22 stating: "A rebate program, separate from the rule amendment, is also proposed."

23 22. On January 9, 2018, the District hosted a Working Group mecting to discuss the
24 proposed amendments to Rule 1111. The PowerPoint prepared for the Working Group meeting
25 contained a different mitigation fee schedule than the fee schedule included in 2017 PAR 1111 and

26 analyzed in the SEA. In the Working Group meeting, the District proposed a two-phased
27 "mitigation" fee and subdividing the four categories of furnaces into subcategories based on size.
28

5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 The fee imposed on the sale of non-complying furnaces would vary based upon the equipment

2 category, the equipment size, and when the unit was sold, until the fees were eventually phased out.

3 23. The PowerPoint presentation given at the Working Group meeting also discussed

4 creating a rebate program.

5 24. On January 30, 2018, the District released its Draft Staff Report ("Staff Report") and

6 a new version of the Proposed Amendment to Rule 1111 (ª2018 PAR 1111"). The fee schedule in

7 2018 PAR 1111 is the same as what was discussed in the Working Group meeting. However, 2018

8 PAR 1111 varied in significant ways from 2017 PAR 1111.

9 25. In the Staff Report, the District again acknowledged the creation of a rebate program:

10 "As a companion of the rule amendment, staff has also proposed to establish a rebate program for

11 consumers who purchase and install compliant furnaces in the [District] to benefit consumers and

12 incentivize the purchase of lower emitting compliant furnaces."

13 26. The SEA was published before the District released the text of 2018 PAR 1111. The

14 District did not prepare a new or a revised Subsequent Environmental Assessment or other
15 environmental document analyzing the potentially significant environmental impacts of 2018 PAR

16 1111.

17 27. The Staff Report discusses 2018 PAR 1111, but is not an environmental document

18 under CEQA and the Staff Report does not analyze the potentially significant environmental impacts

19 of 2018 PAR 1111.

20 28. The District did not provide a new public comment period when it released 2018 PAR

21 1111.

22 29. On February 9, 2018, JCI submitted written comments during the SEA's public

23 comment period, that questioned the deficiencies of the SEA and the significant differences between

24 2017 PAR 1111 and 2018 PAR 1111.

25 30. On March 2, 2018, the District adopted 2018 PAR 1111.

26 31. On March 5, 2018, the District filed its Notice of Determination ("NOD") for the

27 adoption of 2018 PAR 1111.

13 35. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 388, Petitioner/Plaintiff is serving the
14 California Attorney General with a copy of this Petition.

15 36. Additionally, consistent with Public Resources Code 21167.5, Petitioner/Plaintiff
16 has served the District with notice of this suit. A true and correct copy of that notice is attached as
17 Exhibit 1.

18 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

19 37. Petitioner/Plaintiff has performed all conditions precedent to filing this action.
20 Petitioner/Plaintiff participated in the rulemaking process and submitted written comments in a
21 timely manner.

22 38. Petitioner/Plaintiff has complied with Public Resources Code § 21167.6 by timely
23 filing a request concerning the preparation of the record of administrative proceedings relating to the
24 District's adoption of 2018 PAR 1111, which is attached as Exhibit 2.

25 39. Petitioner/Plaintiff has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of

1 environmental impacts of the rule amendment the District proposes to adopt, provides a public

2 comment period, and then holds a public a hearing.

3 40. Petitioner/Plaintiff brought this action within 30 days of the District filing the NOD

4 for 2018 PAR 1111. See Public Resources Code § 21167.

5 STANDING

6 41. JCI has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition/Complaint because it is an

7 entity to which the adopted regulation applies. JCI manufactures, sells, and distributes residential

8 furnaces within the geographic territory administered by the District and those residential furnaces

9 are subject to the District's rules and regulations. JCI's environmental, economic, and beneficial

10 interests are directly and adversely affected by the District's adoption of 2018 PAR 1111. JCI will

11 sustain direct harm and injury-in-fact as a result of the District's actions because 2018 PAR 1111

12 will have a direct, immediate, and adverse impact on JCI's operations and business. That injury is

13 imminent because the Board adopted 2018 PAR 1111 on March 2, 2018 and JCI will be required to

14 pay the increased fee on the sale of any non-compliant furnace sold in the District. This Court has

15 the power to remedy and harm and injury caused by the District's actions by granting JCI the relief

16 requested herein.

17 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

18 (Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act; Inadequate and Incomplete Analysis)

19 42. Petitioner/Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference, as though fully set forth

20 herein, the allegations contained above in Paragraphs 1- 41, inclusive.

21 43. Petitioner/Plaintiff brings this First Cause of Action pursuant to Public Resources

22 Code § 21168 and § 21168.5, on the grounds that the District failed to act in accordance with the law

23 and committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion, in that it considered and approved 2018 PAR 1111

24 without undertaking an analysis of the potentially adverse significant environmental impacts as

25 required by CEQA.

26 44. The District is a "Public Agency" within the meaning of CEQA. Pub. Res. Code §

27 21063; CEQA Guidelines § 15383. CEQA requires public agencies to conduct environmental

28
8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIBF

review prior to approving any discretionary project that may have a significant impact on the

2 environment. The District's approval of 2018 PAR 1111 is a discretionary approval.

3 45. Under CEQA, "Project" means "the whole of an action, which has the potential for

4 resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect

5 physical change in the environment." CEQA Guidelines § 15378(a).

6 46. The District's approval of 2018 PAR 1111 constitutes a "Project" within the meaning

7 of CEQA.

8 47. "Approval" of a project means "the decision by a public agency which commits the

9 agency to a definite course of action in regard to a project intended to be carried out by any person."
10 Guidelines 15352. The District's actions related to its adoption of 2018 PAR 1111 constitute an

11 "approval" within the meaning of CEQA.

12 48. Compliance with the procedural requirements of CEQA informs the public of the

13 proposed project and aids in identifying project alternatives and mitigation measures. These

14 procedural requirements (and the project alternativcs and mitigation measures they identify) further

15 CEQA's purpose of reducing the potential for either a direct or a reasonably foreseeable indirect

16 physical change in the environment. Without a proper procedural foundation, a public agency
17 cannot comply with CEQA's mandate to approve projects as proposed only if there are no feasible

18 alternatives or feasible mitigation measures available which would substantially lessen the

19 significant environmental effects of such projects. Pub. Res. Code § 21102.

20 49. If there is any possibility that a discretionary project being considered for approval by
21 a public agency may have the potential for resulting in a direct or reasonably foreseeable indirect

22 significant effect on the environment, the agency must comply with CEQA. Pub. Res. Code §

23 21080.

24 50. The District committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to comply with
25 CEQA when it failed to conduct an adequate investigation of the impacts of 2018 PAR 1111. The

26 District prepared an SEA and analyzed the potentially significant environmental impacts of 2017
27 PAR 1111. However, after the SEA was released to the public, the District later changed the fee

28 schedule and released a different proposed amendment to Rule 1111-2018 PAR 1111. The District
9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

did not revise the SEA or prepare a new CEQA document to analyze the potentially significant

2 environmental impacts of 2018 PAR 1111. Therefore the District adopted 2018 PAR 1111 without

3 analyzing the potentially significant environmental impacts of 2018 PAR 1111.

4 51. The District also failed to comply with CEQA by undermining the public's ability to

5 provide comments and fully participate in the development of 2018 PAR 1111. The text of 2018

6 PAR 1111 was released on January 30, 2018 in conjunction with the release of the District's Staff

7 Report. Staff Reports do not have public comment periods, so the District did not provide an

8 opportunity to comment on the text of the rule amendment the District ultimately adopted.

9 52. For the reasons stated above, the District's adoption of 2018 PAR 1111 failed to

10 comply with CEQA. 2018 PAR 1111 will have significant economic, operational, and other impacts

11 on Petitioner/Plaintiff. Petitioner/Plaintiff has no other plain, speedy, or adequate legal remedy for

12 this harm and seeks appropriate relief through this Petition and Complaint.

13 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

14 (Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act; Improper Piecemealing)

15 53. Petitioner/Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference, as though fully set forth
16 herein, the allegations contained above in Paragraphs 1- 52, inclusive.

17 54. Petitioner/Plaintiff brings this Second Cause of Action pursuant to Public Resources

18 Code § 21168 and § 21168.5, on the grounds that the District failed to act in accordance with the law

19 and committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion, in that it considered and approved rules without

20 undertaking an analysis of the potential environmental impacts as required by CEQA.

21 55. The District's approval of 2018 PAR 1111 constitutes a "Project" within the meaning

22 of CEQA, although the analysis of the rule's environmental impacts was improperly segmented and

23 conducted separately from the impacts of the forthcoming "companion" rebate program.

24 56. The regulation of the emissions of NOx from residential furnaces, including both the

25 mitigation fee and the forthcoming rebate program, constitutes a "Project" within the meaning of

26 CEQA. CEQA requires the Lead Agency to analyze "the whole of an action."

27 57. The District previously treated the mitigation fee and the rebate together, as

28 evidenced by the fact that both were handled together in previous rulemakings. In the text of 2017
10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

PAR 1111 and 2018 PAR 1111 circulated, the section of Rule 1111 titled "Rebate Incentives for

2 Early Compliance" is in strikethrough, showing that the District was removing the previous rebate
program from Rule 1111 while simultaneously stating that a new rebate program was a separate
4 action.

5 58. Additionally, the District has made several statements indicating that the mitigation

6 fee and the forthcoming rebate program are integrally related. In the Staff Report, the District

7 described the rebate as a "companion of the rule amendment." On March 28, 2018, the District held

8 a working group meeting to discuss further amending Rule 1111 to add "labeling requirements to

9 Rule 1111 for any non-compliant unit" sold in the District and to discuss "Rule 1111 rebate program
10 implementation."

11 59. The District has also provided public notice of .a public consultation meeting to
12 present and solicit information and suggestions from the public about these future amendments to

13 Rule 1111. District Staff determined "that it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility
14 that the proposed amendments to Rule 1111 may have a significant adverse effect on the

15 environment" and thus the future rulemaking is exempt from CEQA.

16 60. The District committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to comply with
17 CEQA when it failed to conduct an adequate investigation of the impacts of 2018 PAR 1111 by

18 excluding from its analysis the potential environmental impacts of the forthcoming rebate program.
19 The District improperly and invalidly segmented its analysis. The potentially significant

20 environmental impacts of 2018 PAR 1111 and the rebate program should not be piecemealed. The

21 District failed to comply with CEQA and committed an abuse of discretion by not analyzing the

22 impacts of 2018 PAR 1111 and the rebate program as a single "project."

23 61. For the reasons stated above, the District's adoption of 2018 PAR 1111 failed to

24 comply with CEQA. 2018 PAR 1111 will have significant economic, operational, and other impacts
25 on Petitioner/Plaintiff. Petitioner/Plaintiff has no other plain, speedy, or adequate legal remedy for
26 this harm and seek appropriate relief through this Petition and Complaint.

4 62.

5 Petitioner/Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference, as though fully set forth
herein, the allegations contained above in Paragraphs 1 - 61 inclusive.

6 63.

7 If significant adverse environmental impacts are identified, CEQA requires the Lead
Agency to analyze measures that could either avoid or substantially reduce any adverse
8 environmental impacts to the greatest extent feasible. CEQA Guidelines $ 15126.4.

9 64.

10 The District concluded that 2017 PAR 1111 would have significant adverse

11 operational air quality impacts. The District was thus required to analyze how to mitigate those air
quality impacts.

12 65.

13 The District stated in the SEA that there were no feasible mitigation measures to

14 mitigate the excess NOx from non-compliant furnaces, and only analyzed imposing a "mitigation"

15 fee of various amounts that would be available for general revenue purposes, including the

16 companion rebate program, of the District. There are mitigation measures, however, available to

17 actually mitigate adverse air quality impacts from the sale of non-compliant NOx furnaces, and the
District is required to analyze them.

18 66.

19 Additionally, although the District has labeled the fee imposed as a "mitigation fee,"

20 the District has expressly stated that the fee does not mitigate the adverse environmental impacts

21 from the sale of non-compliant furnaces in the District. The District has thus failed to justify the

22 need for this "mitigation fee" and how it mitigates the adverse impacts of 2017 PAR 1111. The

23 "mitigation fee" fails to serve as a mitigation measure that the District is required to identify and

24 consider in response to its finding that the Rule would have a significant adverse air quality impact.

67.

25 The SEA did not include any analysis of 2018 PAR 1111, so the District also violated

26 CEQA because it failed to analyze the potentially significant environmental impacts of 2018 PAR
1111 and how to mitigate those impacts.

27 68.

28 For the reasons stated above, the District's adoption of 2018 PAR 1111 failed to
comply with CEQA. 2018 PAR 1111 will have significant economic, operational, and other impacts
12

on Petitioner/Plaintiff. Petitioner/Plaintiff has no other plain, speedy, or adequate legal remedy for

2 this harm and seek appropriate relief through this Petition and Complaint.

3 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

4 (Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act and District Rule 110(e); Inadequate

5 and Incomplete Analysis of Alternatives)

6 69. Petitioner/Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference, as though fully set forth

7 herein, the allegations contained above in Paragraphs 1- 68, inclusive.

8 70. The District is required to develop and analyze a reasonable range of alternatives, and

9 that range "shall include [alternatives] that could feasibly accomplish most of the basic objectives of
10 the project and could avoid or substantially lessen one or more of the significant effects." 14 C.C.R.

11 § 15126.6(c).
12 71. District Rule 110(e) also requires an analysis of alternatives and "[a]ny action or
13 proposal for which significant adverse environmental impacts have been identified during the review
14 process shall not be approved or adopted as proposed if there are feasible mitigation measures or

15 feasible alternatives available which would substantially reduce such adverse impact."
16 72. In the SEA, the District failed to develop and analyze a reasonable range of
17 alternatives. The District analyzed 2017 PAR 1111, a "no project" alternative, and three other

18 alternatives. However, the alternatives are all variations on the same concept: revising the NOx
19 emissions limit under the rule and charging various fee amounts for a set amount of time.
20 73. The District did not analyze any other alternative ways of regulating NOx emissions
21 from furnaces and mitigating the environmental impacts. For example, the District did not analyze

22 using an actual mitigation fee to fund an offset program.

23 74. The District's decision to curtail its alternatives analysis is particularly problematic as
24 the District admitted that the no feasible mitigation measures are available that would eliminate or
25 reduce the significant adverse operational air quality impacts for NOx emissions if 2017 PAR 1111
26 was implemented.

27

28

13
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 75. The District's alternatives analysis also violates CEQA because the District did not

2 analyze 2018 PAR 1111-the alternative the District adopted. The SEA, which contains the

3 alternatives analysis, was published before the District released 2018 PAR 1111.

4 76. For the reasons stated above, the District's adoption of 2018 PAR 1111 failed to

5 comply with CEQA. 2018 PAR 1111 will have significant economic, operational, and other impacts

6 on Petitioner/Plaintiff. Petitioner/Plaintiff has no other plain, speedy, or adequate legal remedy for

7 this harm and seek appropriate relief through this Petition and Complaint.

8 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

(Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act, Health & Safety Code, and California
10 APA for Failure to Disclose Regulatory Provisions to the Public in Advance of Adoption)

11 77. Petitioner/Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference, as though fully set forth

12 herein, the allegations contained above in Paragraphs 1- 76, inclusive.

13 78. The text of 2018 PAR 1111 was released on January 30, 2018, and there was no

14 public comment period provided for 2018 PAR 1111. The public comment period for the SEA,

15 which analyzed a different proposal, closed on February 9, 2018-less than two weeks after 2018

16 PAR 1111 was released.

17 79. The District should have provided additional time for the public to review new 2018

18 PAR 1111 and meaningfully participate in the District's deliberative process relating to these

19 provisions.

20 80. The District's actions violate the California APA, Government Code § 11340 et seq.,

21 by failing to inform the public and provide an opportunity to comment in advance of adopting

22 provisions that will directly impact the regulated comment. California Government Code §

23 11346.8(c) prohibits adopting regulations that have been changed from the version originally made

24 available to the public, unless the change is nonsubstantial or sufficiently related to the original

25 proposal to put the public on notice of the potential change. Here, 2018 PAR 1111 varies

26 significantly from 2017 PAR 1111 because the fee structure, amounts, and duration have all

27 changed. These changes significantly impact the regulated community.

28
14
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- 81.

2 The District's actions also violate the Health & Safety Code. Specifically, H&SC
section 40725 requires the District to provide at least 30 days' prior notice of any proposed new or

4 amended regulations; that notice must include a copy of the proposed rule, a summary description of
the effect of the rule, and an invitation to public comment.

82.

6 2018 PAR 1111 is substantially different than 2017 PAR 1111, and the District did
not comply with these notice requirements before adopting 2018 PAR 1111.

83.

8 Additionally, the District's actions violate Public Resources Code 21092 because

9 the District obtained significant new information and revised the proposed rule amendments without

10 providing a new notice to the public. 2018 PAR 1111 is substantially different than 2017 PAR 1111,

11 and the District failed to comply with these notice requirements.

84.

12 The District's adoption of 2018 PAR 1111 will have significant economic,

13 operational, and other impacts on Petitioner/Plaintiff. Petitioner/Plaintiff has no other plain, speedy,

14 or adequate legal remedy for this harm and seeks appropriate relief through this Petition and
Complaint.

15 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

16

17 (2018 PAR 1111 Constitutes an Illegal Tax; Health and Safety Code section 40727)

85.

18 Petitioner/Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference, as though fully set forth

19 herein, the allegations contained above in Paragraphs 1- 84, inclusive.

86.

20 2018 PAR 1111 requires OEMs who sell non-compliant furnaces in the District to
pay a mitigation fee.

21 87.

22 This fee established by 2018 PAR 1111 is a tax, and a not a regulatory fee. The

23 primary purpose of the fee is to generate revenue, as evidenced by the fact that the revenue from the

24 fee will be used to, among other possible general uses, fund the rebate program, which the District
has "separately" authorized..

25 88.

26 The fee was not passed by a two-thirds supermajority, and thus is illegal. California
Constitution Article XIII A, Section 3.

27 89.

28 Additionally, the District's adoption of this mitigation fee violates Health & Safety
Code section 40727 because the District lacks authority to adopt it.
15
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 90. The District's adoption of 2018 PAR 1111 will have significant economic,

2 operational, and other impacts on Petitioner/Plaintiff. Petitioner/Plaintiff has no other plain, speedy,

3 or adequate legal remedy for this harm and seeks appropriate relief through this Petition and

4 Complaint.

5 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

6 WHEREFORE, Petitioner/Plaintiff prays for judgment and further relief as follows:

7 1. For a peremptory writ of mandate ordering the District to:

8 a. Vacate and set aside the SEA prepared for 2017 PAR 1111;

9 b. Vacate and set aside the NOD for 2018 PAR 1111;

10 C. Prepare, circulate, and consider a new legally adequate CEQA analysis for

11 2018 PAR 1111, which includes an analysis of the companion rebate program,

12 provide a public comment period, respond to all comments received, consider

13 all necessary or appropriate amendments, and hold a board hearing to consider

14 adopting any necessary or appropriate amendments to Rule 1111 based on the

15 legally adequate CEQA analysis;

16 d. Comply with the requirements of the Health & Safety Code in these or any

17 related rulemaking proccedings; and

18 e. Any other peremptory writ relief the Court determines is necessary under Pub.

19 Res. Code $ 21168.9.

20 2. For declaratory relief declaring that the District violated CEQA;

21 3. For declaratory relief declaring that the issuance of the SEA and NOD for 2018 PAR

22 1111 was unlawful; null, void, and unenforceable;

23 4. For declaratory relief declaring that the District lacks authority to impose the
24 mitigation fee for the purpose of generating revenue for unspecified District programs

25 including, without limitation the rebate program, and for injunctive relief enjoining

26 the assessment of the mitigation fee;

27 5. For costs of suit, including reasonable attorneys' fees; and

28 6. For such other equitable or legal relief as the Court may deem just and proper.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING UNLIMITED CIVIL CASES
The following critical provisions of the California Ruies of Court, 3. Title 3, Division 7, as applicable in the Superior Court, are summarized for your assistance.

APPLICATION The Division 7 Rules were effective January 1, 2007. They apply to all general civil cases.
PRIORITY OVER OTHER RULES The Division Rules shall have priority over all other Local Rules to the extent the others are inconsistent.
CHALLENGE TO ASSIGNED JUDGE A challenge under Code of Civil Procedure Section 170.6 must be made within 15 days after notice of assignment for all purposes to a judge, or if a party has not yet appeared, within 15 days of the first appearance.
TIME STANDARDS Cases assigned to the Independent Calendaring Courts will be subject to processing under the following time standards:
COMPLAINTS Ail complaints shall be served within 60 days of filing and proof of service shall be filed within 90 days.

CROSS-COMPLAINTS Without leave of court first being obtained, no cross-complaint may be filed by any party after their answer is filed. Cross- complaints shall be served within 30 days of the filing date and a proof of service filed within 60 days of the filing date.
STATUS CONFERENCE A status conference will be scheduled by the assigned Independent Calendar Judge no later than 270 days after the filing of the complaint. Counsel must be fully prepared to discuss the following issues: alternative dispute resolution, bifurcation, settlement, trial date, and expert witnesses.

FINAL STATUS CONFERENCE
The Court will require the parties to attend a final status conference not more than 10 days before the scheduled trial date. All parties shall have motions in limine, bifurcation motions, statements of major evidentiary issues, dispositive motions, requested form jury instructions. special jury instructions, and special jury verdicts timely filed and served prior to the conference. These matters may be heard and resolved at this conference. At least five days before this conference, counsel must also have exchanged lists of exhibits and witnesses, and have submitted to the court a brief statement of the case to be read to the jury panel as required by Chapter Three of the Los Angeles Superior Court Rules.
SANCTIONS
The court will impose appropriate sanctions for the failure or refusal to comply with Chapter Three Rules, orders made by the Court, and time standards or deadlines established by the Court or by the Chapter Three Rules. Such sanctions may be on a party, or if appropriate, on counsel for a party.
This is not a complete delineation of the Division 7 'or Chapter Three Rules, and adherence only to the above provisions is therefore not guarantee against the imposition of sanctions under Trial Court Delay Reduction. Careful reading and compliance with the actual Chapter Rules is imperative.

Class Actions Pursuant to Local Rule 2.3, all class actions shall be filed at the Stanley Mosk Courthouse and are randomly assigned to a complex judge at the designated complex courthouse. If the case is found not to be class action it will be returned to an Independent Calendar Courtroom for all purposes.
*Provisionally Complex Cases Cases filed as provisionally complex are initially assigned to the Supervising Judge of complex litigation for determination of complex status. If the case is deemed to be complex within the meaning of California Rules of Court 3.400 et seq., it will be randomly assigned to a complex judge at the designated complex courthouse. If the case is found not to be complex, it will be returned to an Independent Calendar Courtroom for all purposes.

CASE NUMBER:
STIPULATION - EARLY ORGANIZATIONAL MEETING

This stipulation is intended to encourage cooperation among the parties at an early stage in the litigation and to assist the parties in efficient case resolution.
The parties agree that:
1. The parties commit to conduct an initial conference (in-person or via teleconference or via videoconference) within 15 days from the date this stipulation is signed, to discuss and consider whether there can be agreement on the following:
a. Are motions to challenge the pleadings necessary? If the issue can be resolved by amendment as of right, or if the Court would allow leave to amend, could an amended complaint resolve most or all of the issues a demurrer might otherwise raise? If so, the parties agree to work through pleading issues SO that a demurrer need only raise issues they cannot resolve. Is the issue that the defendant seeks to raise amenable to resolution on demurrer, or would some other type of motion be preferable? Could a voluntary targeted exchange of documents or information by any party cure an uncertainty in the pleadings?
b. Initial mutual exchanges of documents at the "core" of the litigation. (For example, in an employment case, the employment records, personnel file and documents relating to the conduct in question could be considered "core." In a personal injury case, an incident or police report, medical records, and repair or maintenance records could be considered "core.");

C. Exchange of names and contact information of witnesses;

d. Any insurance agreement that may be available to satisfy part or all of a judgment, or to indemnify or reimburse for payments made to satisfy a judgment;
e. Exchange of any other information that might be helpful to facilitate understanding, handling, or resolution of the case in a manner that preserves objections or privileges by agreement;

f. Controlling issues of law that, if resolved early, will promote efficiency and economy in other phases of the case. Also, when and how such issues can be presented to the Court;
g. Whether or when the case should be scheduled with a settlement officer, what discovery or court ruling on legal issues iS reasonably required to make settlement discussions meaningful, and whether the parties wish to use a sitting judge or a private mediator or other options as

i. Whether the case is suitable for the Expedited Jury Trial procedures (see information at www.lacourt.org under "Civil" and then under "General Information").

2. The time for a defending party to respond to a complaint or cross-complaint will be extended to
(INSERT DATE) for the complaint, and (INSERT DATE) for the cross-
complaint, which is comprised of the 30 days to respond under Government Code § 68616(b), § and the 30 days permitted by Code of Civil Procedure section 1054(a), good cause having been found by the Civil Supervising Judge due to the case management benefits provided by this Stipulation. A copy of the General Order can be found at www.lacourt.org under "Civir, click on "General Information", then click on "Voluntary Efficient Litigation Stipulations".

ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR)
INFORMATION PACKET

The person who files a civil lawsuit (plaintiff) must include the ADR information
Packet with the complaint when serving the defendant. Cross-complainants must serve the ADR Information Packet on any new parties named to the action
together with the cross-complaint.
There are a number of ways to resolve civil disputes without having to sue

resolution (ADR). someone. These alternatives to a lawsuit are known as alternative dispute

In ADR, trained, impartial persons decide disputes or help parties decide disputes themselves. These persons are called neutrals. For example, in mediations, the neutral is the mediator. Neutrals normally are chosen by the disputing parties or by the court. Neutrals can help resolve disputes without having to go to court.

LAADR 005 (Rev. 03/17)
LASC Adopted 10-03
Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.221

Advantages of ADR
Often faster than going to trial Often less expensive, saving the litigants court costs, attorney's fees and expert fees. May permit more participation, allowing parties to have more control over the outcome. Allows for flexibility in choice of ADR processes and resolution of the dispute. Fosters cooperation by allowing parties to work together with the neutral to resolve the dispute and
_et. mutually agree to remedy. There are fewer, if any, court appearances. Because ADR can be faster and save money, it can reduce
stress.

Disadvantages of ADR - ADR may not be suitable for every dispute. If ADR is binding, the parties normally give up most court protections, including a decision by a judge or jury under formal rules of evidence and procedure, and review for legal error by an appellate court. ADR may not be effective if it takes place before the parties have sufficient information to resolve the
dispute.
The neutral may charge a fee for his or her services. If the dispute is not resolved through ADR, the parties may then have to face the usual and traditional costs of trial, such as attorney's fees and expert fees.

The Most Common Types of ADR

Mediation

In mediation, a neutral (the mediator) assists the parties in reaching a mutually acceptable resolution of their dispute. Unlike lawsuits or some other types of ADR, the parties, rather than the mediator,
decide how the dispute is to be resolved.
Mediation is particularly effective when the parties have a continuing relationship, like neighbors or business people. Mediation is also very effective where personal feelings are getting in the way of a resolution. This is because mediation normally gives the parties a chance to express their feelings and find out how the other sees things.
Mediation may not be effective when one party is unwilling to cooperate or compromise or when one of the parties has a significant advantage in power over the other. Therefore, it may
not be a good choice if the parties have a history of abuse or victimization.

N Arbitration

In arbitration, a neutral person called an "arbitrator" hears arguments and evidence from each side and then decides the outcome of the dispute, Arbitration is typically less formal than a trial, and the rules of evidence may be relaxed. Arbitration may be either "binding" or "non- binding." Binding arbitration means the parties waive their right to a trial and agree to accept the arbitrator's decision as final. Non-binding arbitration means that the parties are free to request a trial if they reject the arbitrator's decision.

Arbitration is best for cases where the parties want another person to decide the outcome of
their dispute for them but would like to avoid the formality, time, and expense of a trial. It may also be appropriate for complex matters where the parties want a decision-maker who has
training or experience in the subject matter of the dispute.

Mandatory Settlement Conference (MSC)

Settlement Conferences are appropriate in any case where settlement is an option. Mandatory Settlement Conferences are ordered by the Court and are often held near the date
a case is set for trial. The parties and their attorneys meet with a judge who devotes his or her time exclusively to preside over the MSC. The judge does not make a decision in the case but assists the parties in evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the case and in negotiating a settlement.

The Los Angeles Superior Court Mandatory Settlement Conference (MSC) program is free of charge and staffed by experienced sitting civil judges who devote their time exclusively to
presiding over MSCs. The judges participating in the judicial MSC program and their locations are identified in the List of Settlement Officers found on the Los Angeles Superior Court website at http://www.lacourt.org/.This program is available in general jurisdiction cases with represented parties from independent calendar (IC) and Central Civil West (CCW) courtrooms. In addition, on an ad hoc basis, personal injury cases may be referred to the program on the eve of trial by the personal injury master calendar courts in the Stanley Mosk Courthouse or the
asbestos calendar court in CCW.

In order to access the Los Angeles Superior Court MSC Program the judge in the IC courtroom, the CCW Courtroom or the personal injury master calendar courtroom must refer the parties to
the program. Further, all parties must complete the information requested in the Settlement Conference Intake Form and email the completed form to mscdept18@lacourt.org.
