1. In this Amended verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint,
2 Petitioners/Plaintiffs Western States Petroleum Association ("WSPA"), Valero Refining Company -

3 California ("Valero"), Tesoro Refining & Marketing Co. (*Tesoro"), and Phillips 66 Company

4 ("Phillips 66") (collectively "Petitioners/Plaintiffs") ask this Court to declare as invalid,

5 unenforceable, and ultra vires certain actions of Respondent/Defendant Bay Area Air Quality

6 Management District (the "District"), including the District's November 15, 2017 approval of a

7 "Recirculated Final Environmental Impact Report" ("REIR") and the District's related, recent

8 adoption of a new regulation, "Regulation 11-18: Reduction of Risk From Air Toxic Emissions at

9 Existing Facilities" ("Rule 11-18"), which is a part of the District's broader "Petroleum Refinery

10 Emissions Reduction Strategy" (the "Refinery Project" or "Refinery Strategy").

11 2. Petitioners/Plaintiffs further seek a writ of mandate ordering the District to vacate and

12 rescind the challenged actions, as well as appropriate declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and

13 reasonable costs incurred by Petitioners/Plaintiffs to bring this action. Petitioners/Plaintiffs timely

14 filed a Petition and Complaint in this Court on December 15, 2017, and now file this amended

15 Petition and Complaint within 30 days of the original complaint, and before any Answer was filed in

16 this action. Petitioners/Plaintiffs further allege as follows:

17 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND

18 3. The District's Refinery Project is an unjustified and unnecessary initiative that

19 unfairly targets emissions from five refineries located in the Bay Area. On October 15, 2014, the

20 District's Board adopted Resolution 2014-17 ("Resolution 2014-17"), which directed District staff

21 to, among other things, develop a strategy to reduce emissions from refineries by 20%. It also

22 directed District staff to strive to achieve an additional 20% reduction in health risks related to the

23 emission of toxic air contaminants ("TACs").

24 4. This pronouncement was made without any analysis of the need for the 20%

25 reductions, associated costs, alternative strategies, continuity with current regulations, interaction of

26 other emissions sources, or the legality of the District's action.

27 5. According to the District's Bay Area Emissions Inventory Summary Report: Criteria

28 Air Pollutants (2014), petroleum refineries account for less than 3% of all criteria pollutant
2
Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief; Case No. N17-2300

1 emissions in the Bay Area. But despite the relatively minor contribution of refineries to this risk, the

* 2 District has targeted refineries for a 20% reduction in emissions, while taking no similar action with

3 respect to any other industry.

4 6. According to the District's Improving Air Quality & Health In Bay Area CommunitiesI

5 (2014), diesel particulate emissions account for 86% of all cancer risk from TACs in the Bay Area,

6 and on-road mobile sources and aircraft are the two largest contributors to non-cancer heälth risks in

7 the Bay Area. According to the District, "industrial and commercial equipment" collectively

8 contribute just 7% of all cancer risk from TACs, with refineries comprising only a small subset of

9 that total. Again, despite the relatively minor contribution of refineries, the District has targeted

10 refineries for a 20% reduction in health risks from the TAC emissions, while taking no similar action

11 with respect to any other industry.

12 7. The District admits that a air quality data shows a "dramatic decline" in air pollution

13 over the past 30 years and that "air pollutants from Bay Area refineries . generally have been
14 substantially reduced over the past several decades."

15 8. The District has not justified the need for any new regulations targeting refinery

16 emissions.

17 9. The District has stated that it plans to implement Resolution 2014-17 by issuing

18 multiple sets of interrelated rules governing refinery emissions or other aspects of refinery

19 operations (i.e., the Refinery Project).

20 10. The District is implementing its Refinery Project by undertaking-in its own words-

21 related "sets" or "phases" of rules that together form "a suite of" interrelated rulemaking actions that,

22 individually and in aggregate, have a significant impact on refineries and the environment. The

23 District has repeatedly and improperly divided this interrelated and interdependent suite of refinery

24 rules across multiple rulemaking efforts.

25 11. Rule 11-18 is a component of the Refinery Project, notwithstanding that the rule

26 applies to other stationary sources. Rule 11-18's origin is rooted in the District's resolution to

27 reduce health risks related to TACs emitted from refineries by 20%. Rule 11-18 grew out of the

28 District's development of Regulation 12, Rule 16, Petroleum Refining Greenhouse Gas Emissions
3
Amended Verified Petition for. Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief; Case No. N17-2300

P Limits ("Rule 12-16") and is repeatedly included by the District in presentations and other public

2 materials describing the District's Refinery Project.

3 12. At last count, the istrict promulgated five refinery rules within a four-month

4 window to advance the Refinery Project, and its adoption of Rule 11-18 marks the sixth such action.

5 13. Despite the interrelated nature of these actions and their common underlying

6 purpose-to fulfill the Board's arbitrary mandate of a 20% reduction in refinery emissions and a

7 20% reduction in health risks-the District has consistently refused to analyze its Refinery Project
8| rulemakings in a comprehensive manner to assess their aggregate impact.

9 14. When promulgating rules and regulations, the District is required to comply with the

10 requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code, §

11 21000 et seq. CEQA is further implemented by the CEQA Guidelines, Title 14, California Code of

12 Regulations, § 15000 et seq. ("Guidelines"). CEQA and its Guidelines impose procedural and

13 substantive requirements on public agencies when they undertake or approve an activity defined by

14 CEQA as a "project."

15 15. Among other things, CEQA requires an initial environmental study to determine if a

16 "project" will have a significant effect on the environment, If so, the lead agency must prepare an

17 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") evaluating numerous criteria. If the lead agency determines

18 that a project will not have a significant environmental impact, the agency may issue a "negative

19 declaration" that is supported by the findings of its initial study.

20 16. CEQA also prohibits "piecemealing" projects to create the appearance of a lesser

21 degree of impact. That is exactly what the District has done here: it has evaluated Rule 11-18 in
are part of 22 isolation, rather than analyzing the aggregate and cumulative impacts of all the rules that

23 the Refinery Project.

24 17. This action challenges the District's adoption of Rule 11-18, the District's approval of

25 a "Recirculated Environmental Impact Report" ("REIR") for Rule 11-18, and the District's

26 subsequent issuance of its related Notice of Determination ("NOD").

27 18. Although Rule 11-18 is on its face a rule of general applicability, it was conceived

28 and adopted as one component of the District's Refinery Project, which in totality constitutes a
4
Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief; Case No. N17-2300

P single "project" under CEQA.

• 2 19.

3 The District's analysis in the REIR is flawed and fails to comply with CEQA,

4 because it improperly piecemeals the environmental analysis of the Refinery Project, thereby failing

5 to analyze the aggregate impacts of the Refinery Project rules or evaluate whether the incremental

6 impacts of the Refinery Project as a whole are cumulatively considerable when combined with the

7 impacts of other past, present, and probable future rules or regulatory actions pursued by the District
and other agencies.

8 20.

9 The District's CEQA analysis is further flawed because it fails to adequately consider

10 all impacts arising from Rule 11-18 itself, including without limitation the direct, indirect and

11 cumulative impacts from the increased use of certain emissions control technologies, such as thermal
oxidizers and carbon adsorption.

12 21.

13 These actions violate the letter and spirit of CEQA and other requirements of

California law.

14 22.

15 In addition to violating CEQA, the District's adoption of Rule 11-18 was arbitrary,
capricious, and lacked adequate evidentiary support.

16 23.

17 While refineries contribute only a small amount to the Bay Area's total air emissions,

18 the District has arbitrarily targeted refineries for a 20% reduction in health risk from the emission of

19 toxic compounds-a capricious action not taken against any other industry nor justified as necessary

20 by the District. Even assuming the 20% reduction target was justified, which it is not, the District

21 ignored its original 20% pronouncement and instead adopted provisions in Rule 11-18 that would
amount to a reduction of over 90%.

22 24.

23 Through Rule 11-18, the District would implement that 90% reduction by abandoning

24 a long-standing risk action threshold of 100-in-a-million ("100/M*) in favor of a 10-in-a-million
("10/M") standard.

25 25,

26 The 100/M threshold has been used for decades by air quality agencies across the

27 country, including in California, and has been endorsed by the United States Environmental

28 Protection Agency ("EPA") and upheld by courts for over 30 years. When adopting Rule 11-18, the
District failed to explain why a 10/M threshold is now appropriate, and did not justify its departure
5
Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief; Case No. N17-2300

1 from the long-standing threshold of 100/M. These actions are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of

2 agency discretion, and lack support in the record.

3 26. The District's actions also are contrary to the California Health and Safety Code

4 ("H&SC"'), which imposes procedural and substantive requirements on actions taken by the District.

5 Among other things, the law requires the District to:

6 Assure that rules meet criteria for "necessity, authority, clarity, consistency, non-

7 duplication and reference." H&SC § 40727.

8 Consider cost effectiveness of control measures and make related findings available to

9 the public. H&SC § 40703.

10 Each of these requirements is intended to assure that regulations are promulgated only after a

11 reasoned, transparent decision-making process. In each instance, the District failed to adhere to the

12 basic rulemaking requirements, relying on conclusory analysis or ignoring requirements altogether.

13 27. The District failed to justify the necessity of Rule 11-18 for the same reason that the

14 rule is arbitrary and capricious: nowhere in the record does the District justify or provide a oredible

15 basis for establishing a risk threshold that is an order-of-magnitude departure from long-standing

16 practice. The District further fails to explain why Rule 11-18 is necessary to reduce health risks,

17 given that the District's own data indicates that diesel emissions account for 86% of all cancer risk

18 from TACs in the Bay Area, with emissions from all "industrial and commercial equipment" in the

19 Bay Area collectively accounting for just 7% of all risk.

20 28. Rule 11-18 also lacks the clarity required by law. Repeatedly, the District fails to

21 define various vital terms and defines others only by reference to other rules, which in turn, contain

22 numerous cross-references. By relying on undefined terms and a matrix of cross-references that is

23 nearly impossible to untangle, the District violated the H&S Code's clarity requirement. These

24 failings also render Rule 11-18 overly vague, unenforceable, and void.

25 29. Rule 11-18 has several other fatal defects related to the District's over-reach and its

26 efforts to impose requirements that are preempted by existing state and federal laws. Specifically,

27 the District lacks authority to regulate cargo carriers and its attempts to do so in Rule 11-18 are

28 preempted. In addition, AB 617 requires the Air Resources Board to establish a state-wide emissions
6
Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief; Case No. N17-2300

inventory that is consistent across all air districts. By doing so, the legislature impliedly preempted

2 the parallel inventory system relied on by Rule 11-18

3 30. Given these serious shortcomings, Petitioners/Plaintiffs seek a determination from

4 this Court that:

5 The District's issuance of the REIR and NOD for Rule 11-18 was unlawful, null, void,

6 and unenforceable.

7 Rule 11-18, and the District's promulgation of that rule, is invalid and void for failing to

8 satisfy the requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines.

9 Rule 11-18 is invalid and void because it is arbitrary, capricious, and lacks adequate basis

10 in the record.

11 Rule 11-18 is invalid and void because the District failed to comply with H&SC §§

12 40727, 40703.

13 Rule 11-18 is void for lack of necessity, due to the District's failure to demonstrate a

14 need for the regulation with substantial evidence in the record.

15 Rule 11-18, or any portion thereof addressing cargo carriers and other mobile sources, is

16 ultra vires and preempted by both California and Federal law.

17 Rule 11-18 is ultra vires and preempted by AB 617.

18 Rule 11-18 is void for vagueness because it does not define core terms and provisions

19 and leaves the District with unfettered discretion to interpret these terms at whim.

20 Portions of Rule 11-18 that were adopted at the last minute, with no prior public notice or

21 opportunity to comment, are invalid and void because the District's actions violated the

22 procedural requirements of the California Administrative Procedure Act, the H&SC, and

23 CEQA.

24 All actions taken as part of the District's Refinery Project are invalid and void for failing

25 to satisfy the requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines.

26 31. For the foregoing reasons, Petitioners/Plaintiffs ask this Court to issue a writ of

27 mandate requiring the District to vacate and rescind Rule 11-18, or grant such other relief as the

28 Court deems just and proper.
7
Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief; Case No. N17-2300

1 32. Petitioners/Plaintiffs also ask this Court for declaratory relief and judgment against

2 the District declaring that Rule 11-18 (i) is arbitrary, capricious, and lack adequate basis in the

3 record; (ii) the District's promulgation of Rule 11-18 violates H&SC §§ 40727 and/or 40703; (iii)

4 Rule 11-18 is void for vagueness and unenforceable; (iv) the District's promulgation of Rule 11-18

5 provisions related to cargo carriers are ultra vires and preempted by both California and Federal law;

6 (v) provisions of Rule 11-18 adopted in violation of rulemaking procedural requirements are void

7 and unenforceable; and (vi) granting any other declaratory relief the Court deems just and proper.

8 33. Petitioners/Plaintiffs further seek injunctive relief and ask this Court to enjoin the

9 District from enforcing any of the requirements contained in Rule 11-18.

11 REGULATORY & PROCEDURAL HISTORY

40.

12 The District began its arbitrary refinery emissions initiative with its 2014 adoption of

13 Resolution 2014-17. That resolution contained within it two entirely arbitrary and capricious

14. directives that established the District's objectives for its Refinery Project: (1) reduce emissions

15 from refineries by 20% and (2) strive to achieve an additional 20% reduction in health risk from the
emission of TACs from refineries.

16 41.

17 The District envisioned implementing these concrete objectives through a "suite" of

18 regulations, with the first phase of those regulations targeting emissions and the second phase

19 targeting health risks. The District began this process in 2015 when it proposed a related package of

20 six regulations aimed at its first goal of reducing refinery emissions by 20%. Rule 11-18 is aimed at
health risk reductions and represents one component of the District's second phase. Each of these
21 regulationsand others yet to be adopted-are constituent parts of a greater whole: the District's

22 Refinery Project.

23 42.

24 In 2015, the District began the Refinery Project by proposing a package of six

25 refinery-focused regulations. The District prepared a draft EIR for two of those regulations, but did

26 not prepare an EIR for any of the other four rules. Shortly before its board meeting in December,

27 2015, the District withdrew three rules from consideration: Two of the withdrawn rules were

28 Regulation 12, Rule 15: Petroleum Refining Emissions Tracking ("Rule 12-15"); and Regulation 9,
Rule 14: Petroleum Coke Calcining Operations ("Rule 9-14").
9
Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief; Case No. N17-2300

H 43. The District adopted the remaining three of the remaining four rules at the December

2 16, 2015 Board meeting. The rules adopted in 2015 include Regulation 6, Rule 5: Particulate

3 Emissions from Refinery Fluidized Catalytic Cracking Units ("Rule 6-5"); Regulation 8, Rule 18:

4 Equipment Leaks ("Rule 8-18"); and Regulation 11, Rule 10: Hexavalent Chromium Emissions from

5 AlL Cooling Towers and Total Hydrocarbon Emissions from Petroleum Refinery Cooling Towers

6 ("Rule 11-10").

7 44. On January 22, 2016, three Bay Area refiners filed a Petition and Complaint in this

8 Court alleging that Rule 6-5, Rule 8-18, and Rule 11-10 violate CEQA, fail to comply with the

9 California Health & Safety Code, are arbitrary and capricious, and constitute illegal, ultra vires

10 actions. That action is currently pending in this Court as Case No. N16-0095 and implicates many

11 of the same claims and issues as Petitioners/Plaintiffs raise in this case.

12 45. The District subsequently re-proposed Rules 12-15 and 9-14. This time, there was no

13 EIR prepared for Rule 12-15.

14 46. On April 20, 2016less than four months after promulgating its initial batch of

15 refinery rulesthe District adopted Rules 12-15 and 9-14 as part of its Refinery Strategy. The

16 District asserts that these two regulations will reduce emissions of criteria pollutants and their

17 precursors from the Bay Area refineries and associated facilities.

18 47. Despite coming on the heels of its first "phase" of refinery regulations (the three rules
19 promulgated in late 2015), the District's CEQA analysis evaluated Rules 12-15 and 9-14 in isolation,

20 rather than conducting a comprehensive analysis of all the Refinery Project rules or their cumulative

21 environmental impacts.

22 48. On May 25, 2016, WSPA, Tesoro, Valero, and Phillips 66 filed a Petition and

23 Complaint in this Court alleging that Rule 12-15 and 9-14 violate CEQA, fail to comply with the

24 California Health & Safety Code, are arbitrary and capricious, and constitute illegal, ultra vires

25 actions. That action is currently pending in this Court as Case No. N16-0963, and implicates many

26 of the same claims and issues as Petitioners/Plaintiffs raise in this case. A hearing on the merits

27 currently is set for March 5, 2018.

28 49. Notwithstanding these prior lawsuits and numerous written and oral comments
10
Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief; Case No. N17-2300

I submitted by WSPA and its members, the District continued its pattern of violating CEQA when it

2 adopted Rule 11-18.

3 50. The District has consistently and repeatedly identified Rule 11-18 as part of its

4 broader Refinery Project, and specifically included Rule 11-18 in public materials describing the

5 District's Refinery Project.

6 51. In September of 2016, the District released a draft project description that included

7 Rule 11-18 and another Refinery Project Rule, Rule 12-16. The District specifically identified both

8 rules as part of its broader Refinery Project. Petitioners/Plaintiffs submitted comments to the

9 District on this action.

10 52. In October, 2016, the District released draft versions of Rule 11-18 and 12-16, along

11 with a CEQA Notice of Preparation and Initial Study for both rules, which clearly indicates the

12 District's then-existing intent to evaluate and adopt these two rules in parallel, as part of the

13 District's broader efforts to reduce refinery emissions, and linked both Rule 11-18 and Rule 12-16 to

14 Resolution 2014-17. Petitioners/Plaintiffs submitted comments to the District on these actions.

15 53. On March 2, 2017, the District released new versions of Rule 12-16, Rule 11-18, and

16 a single Draft Environmental Impact Report encompassing both rules ("DEIR"). As one alternative

17 to adopting Rule 12-16, the District considered in the DEIR "Rules and rule amendments in the
18 Refinery Strategy", including "the combination of proposed 11-18 and draft Rule 13-1." And in the

19 District's Staff Report for Rule 12-16 and Rule 11-18, the District further links Rule 11-18 to its
•20 Refinery Project, stating that the "District has developed a different approach [to Rule 12-16] that

21 directly addresses concerns about health risks to the refinery communities. The staff
22 recommendation is that the Air District adopt new Regulation 11, Rule 18... "

23 54. Petitioners/Plaintiffs submitted comments to the District on the DEIR and draft Rules

24 12-16 and 11-18.

25 55. Following the enactment of AB 617 Nonvehicular air pollution: criteria air

26 pollutants and toxic air contaminants and AB 398, which amended AB 32, the California Global

27 Warming Solutions Act of 2006, the District it announced that it would suspend further action on rule

28 12-16 and focus instead on Rule 11-18.
11
Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief; Case No. N17-2300

56. On October 5, 2017, the District released a revised version of Rule 11-18 and a

2 Recirculated Draft Environmental Impact Report ("RDEIR") for Rule 11-18. Despite previously

3 analyzing Rules 12-16 and 11-18 in a single DEIR, but subsequently eliminating Rule 12-16 from

4 consideration, the RDEIR was not a new a analysis. Instead it was, according it to the District, simply

5 "revised to address only proposed Rule 11-18 and to reflect revisions in proposed Rule 11-18." The

6 District further concluded that the omission of Rule 12-16 did not alter the conclusions of the

7 RDEIR with respect to cumulative impacts.

8 57. The RDEIR found that rule 11-18 would create significant environmental impacts due

9 tO construction activities and increased water demand and greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions likely

10 to result from the rule's implementation. Petitioners/Plaintiffs submitted comments to the District on

11 the RDEIR and October 2017 draft of Rule 11-18.

12 58. At a public hearing held on November 15, 2017, the District's Board of Directors

13 voted to adopt Rule 11-18 and approve the REIR, and approve the District's related Resolution

14 2017-11. Resolution 2017-11 also contained never-before announced regulatory provisions related

15 to the implementation of key components of Rule 11-18.

16 59. The District posted the NOD for Rule 11-18 in Contra Costa County on November

17 17, 2017.

18 60. The District failed to comply with California law when it issued the NOD, approved

19 the REIR, and adopted Rule 11-18.

20 61. Petitioners/Plaintiffs timely filed this Petition and Complaint on December 15, 2017.

STANDING

2 71. WSPA has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition/Complaint because its

3 members are entities to which the adopted regulations apply. WSPA's members own and/or operate

4 refineries that are within the geographic territory administered by the District and which are subject

5 to the District's rules and regulations. WSPA's members' environmental, economic, and/or

6 beneficial interests are directly and adversely affected by the District's approval of the Refinery

7 Project and associated rules, including Rule 11-18. WSPA's members will sustain direct harm and

8 injury-in-fact as a result of the District's actions because Rule 11-18 and other components of the

9 Refinery Project will have a direct, immediate, and adverse impact on the refinery operations and

10 businesses of WSPA's members. That injury is imminent because Rule 11-18 and other components

11 of the Refinery Project will become effective on their specified dates in the near future. This Court

12 has the power to remedy the harm and injury caused by the District's actions by granting WSPA and

13 its members the relief requested herein.

14 72. Individual Petitioners/Plaintiffs Tesoro, Valero, and Phillips 66 each have standing to

15 assert the claims raised in this Petition/Complaint because they are entities to which the adopted

16 regulations apply. Tesoro, Valero, and Phillips 66 each own and/or operate refineries that are within

17 the geographic territory administered by the District and which are subject to the District's rules and

18 regulations. The environmental, economic, and/or beneficial interests of these individual
19 Petitioners/Plaintiffs are directly and adversely affected by the District's approval of the Refinery

20 Project and associated rules, including Rule 11-18. The individual Petitioners/Plaintiffs will sustain

21 direct harm and an injury-in-fact as a result of the District's actions because the District's new

22 regulations will have a direct, immediate, and adverse impact on their refinery operations and

23 businesses. That injury is imminent because the newly-passed regulations will become effective on

24 their specified dates in the near future, requiring certain actions in a matter of months. This Court

25 has the power to remedy the harm and injury caused by the District's actions and its new refinery

26 regulations by granting the relief requested herein.

1 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act; Improper Piecemealing)

3 73. Petitioners/Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference, as though fully set forth

4 herein, the allegations contained above in Paragraphs 1-72, inclusive.

5 74. Petitioners/Plaintiffs bring this First Cause of Action pursuant to Public Resources

6 Code § 21168 and § 21168.5, on the grounds that the District failed to act in accordance with the law

7 and committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion, in that it considered and approved regulations/rules

8 without undertaking an analysis f the potential environmental impacts as required by CEQA.

9 75. The District is a "Public Agency" within the meaning of CEQA. Pub. Res. Code

10 21063; Guidelines § 15383. CEQA requires public agencies to conduct environmental review prior

11 to approving any discretionary project that may have a significant impact on the environment. The

12 District's approval of Rule 11-18 is a discretionary approval.

13 76. Under CEQA, "Project" means "the whole of an action, which has the potential for

14 resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect

15 physical change in the environment." Guidelines § 15378(a).

16 77. The Refinery Project, including all rules adopted as part of it, constitutes a "Project"

17 within the meaning of CEQA. CEQA requires that all cumulative impacts related to that Project

18 must be analyzed together.

19 78. The District's approval of Rule 11-18 also constitutes a "Project" within the meaning

20 of CEQA, although the analysis of the rule's environmental impacts was improperly segmented and

21 conducted separately from those of the Refinery Project as a whole.

22 79. "Approval" of a project means "the decision by a public agency which commits the

23 agency to a definite course of action in regard to a project intended to be carried out by any person."
24 Guidelines 15352. The District's actions related to its adoption of Rule 11-18 constitute an

25 "approval" within the meaning of CEQA.

26 80. Compliance with the procedural requirements of CEQA informs the public of the

27 proposed project and aids in identifying Project alternatives and mitigation measures. These

28 procedural requirements (and the Project alternatives and mitigation measures they identify) further
15
Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief; Case No. N17-2300

CEQA's purpose of reducing the potential for either a direct or a reasonably foreseeable indirect

2 physical change in the environment. Without a proper procedural foundation, a public agency
cannot comply with CEQA's mandate to approve projects as proposed only if there are no feasible

4 alternatives or feasible mitigation measures available which would substantially lessen the
significant environmental effects of such projects. Pub. Res. Code § 21002.

6 81. If there is any possibility that a discretionary project being considered for approval by

7 a public agency may have the potential for resulting in a direct or reasonably foresecable indirect

8 significant effect on the environment, the agency must comply with CEQA. Pub. Res. Code §
21080.

10 82. The Refinery Project and its related rules have the potential for resulting in a direct or

11 reasonably foreseeable indirect significant effect on the environment. As a whole, the rules

12 comprising the Refinery Project are designed as part of a sweeping, comprehensive "package" to

13 achieve the mandate of Resolution 2014-17.

14 83. On repeated occasions, the District has publically identified Rule 11-18 as a

15 component of its broader Refinery Project.

16 84. The District committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to comply with

17 CEQA when it failed to conduct an adequate investigation of the impacts of the proposed Refinery

18 Project in the following respects, among others:

19 a, The District improperly and invalidly segmented the Refinery Project and its

20 analysis of all rules promulgated as part of it, including Rule 11-18.

21 b. Section 15378(a) of the CEQA Guidelines states that a "project" under

22 environmental review must be the "whole of the action." The "project"-or "whole of the action"-

23 was, at a minimum, the set of six regulations that the District has adopted to-date as part of its

24 Refinery Project.

25 c. The District has already improperly segmented the Refinery Project into at
26 least multiple separate "sets" or "phases" of rulemaking. Substantial evidence in the record supports

27 a a fair argument that, taken as a whole, the Refinery Project may result in significant adverse impacts,

28 thereby requiring preparation of an EIR that evaluates all associated impacts.
16
Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief; Case No. N17-2300

- d. The District failed to comply with CEQA and committed an abuse of

2 discretion by not analyzing the impacts of the Refinery Project as whole. When the District

3 identifies a number of rules as belonging to a single, industry-wide "strategy," aimed at a single

4 objective, it must evaluate the impacts of the rules that comprise that "strategy" as a whole and not

5 in a piecemeal manner. Furthermore, the District also must continually update its analysis for each

6 new it rule that it releases, taking into account the impacts and effects of past actions that were adopted

7 as part of the same strategy or project. The narrowly-focused REIR which the District approved for

8 Rule 11-18 does not consider the cumulative impacts resulting from Rule 11-18 in combination with

9 the other components of the Refinery Project, nor provide any form of analysis or update related to

10 the Refinery Project as a whole. For example, Rules 8-18 and 12-15 supply much of the data to be

11 used for the health risk assessments which are at the heart of the Rule 11-18 process as it applies to

12 refineries.

13 e. The interrelated nature of the Refinery Project and the various rules the

14 District has adopted as part of that project requires the District to analyze the whole of the action in

15 single, comprehensive manner, which the District has failed to do in violation of CEQA.

16 f. The District failed to comply with CEQA and committed an abuse of

17 discretion by not adequately informing the public of the true nature of the Refinery Project and of its

18 decision not to discuss the Refinery Project at a Public Hearing. No Hearing Notice related to Rule

19 11-18 informs the public that the "Project" under discussion is the Refinery Project or a component

20 thereof.

21 g. The District failed to comply with CEQA and committed an abuse of

22 discretion by not adequately informing the public regarding the interrelated nature of its proposed

23 refinery rules by piecemealing its analysis and treating each rule as a wholly separate action or

24 project for purposes of notice-and-comment rulemaking, public hearings, and related regulatory

25 proccedings.

26 85. For the reasons stated above, the District's adoption of Rule 11-18 failed to comply

27 with CEQA. Rule 11-18 will have significant economic, operational, and other impacts on

28 Petitioners/Plaintiffs. Petitioners/Plaintiffs have no other plain, speedy, or adequate legal remedy for
17

this harm and seek appropriate relief through this Petition and Complaint.

2 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

3 (Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act; Inadequate and Incomplete Analysis)

4 86. Petitioners/Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference, as though fully set forth

5 herein, the allegations contained above in Paragraphs 1-85.

6 87. Petitioners/Plaintiffs bring this Second Cause of Action pursuant to Public Resources

7 Code § 21168 and § 21168.5, on the grounds that the District failed to act in accordance with the law

8 and committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion, in that it considered and approved regulations/rules

9 without undertaking an analysis of the potential environmental impacts as required by CEQA.

10 88. CEQA requires the District to analyze all direct, indirect and cumulative impacts

11 arising from the whole of a given action. To fulfill this mandate, the District is obligated to consider

12 "all phases of a project" including "planning, acquisition, development, and operation." Guidelines

13 LOP 15126.

14 89. The REIR does not adequately consider all environmental impacts arising from Rule
15 11-18. The District acknowledges in the REIR that carbon adsorption and thermal oxidizers are

16 control technologies that could be used to reduce emissions at certain facilities, such as sewage

17 treatment plants and landfills. However, the District fails to identify thermal oxidizers and carbon

18 adsorption as potential control technologies for refinery fugitive emissions, and underestimates the

19 emissions and environmental impacts associated with the installation and increased operation of both

20 carbon adsorption and thermal oxidizers.

21 90. The REIR fails to address the additional construction and operational impacts of

22 applying thermal oxidizers and carbon adsorption to refineries. At least one Bay Area refinery

23 already has permits for and operates these technologies.

24 91. The District's failure to adequately consider impacts related to thermal oxidizers and

25 carbon adsorption undermines the integrity of the REIR and calls into question whether the District

26 has properly accounted for and analyzed the applicability of other control technologies to other

27 facilities. As a result, the REIR understates the environmental impacts for at least air quality and
28 hydrology.
18
Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief; Case No. N17-2300

- 92.

2 The REIR also does not adequately consider environmental impacts associated with

3 the installation and operation of wet gas scrubbers. The District estimates that at least 10 "smaller"

4 wet gas scrubbers and three "large" wet gas scrubbers may need to be installed in order to achieve

5 the 10/M risk threshold established by Rule 11-18. According to the District, wet gas scrubbers are

6 significant contributors to construction air emission and water demand but the REIR fails to

7 adequately account for the enhanced environmental impacts caused by the installation and operation
of these additional devices.

8 93.

9 By failing to account for environmental impacts related to the installation and

10 operation of control technologies that include carbon adsorption, thermal oxidizers, and wet gas

11 scrubbers, the District has failed to comply with CEQA's requirement to comprehensively analyze
all impacts.

12 94.

13 CEQA further requires the District to evaluate "Alternatives to the Proposed Project."

14 Guidelines § 15126(f). This mandate requires that an "EIR shall describe a range of reasonable

15 alternatives to the project .. . which would feasibly attain most of the basic objectives of the project
but would avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the project, and evaluate the
16 comparative merits of the alternative." Guidelines § 15126.6. The "rule of reason" governs which

17 alternatives must be included in this analysis.

18 95.

19 The District's stated objective for adopting Rule 11-18 is to reduce health risks

20 associated with toxic air contaminants by 20%. According to the District, diesel particulate

21 emissions account for 86% of all cancer risk from toxic air contaminants in the Bay Area. The REIR

22 itself states that diesel particulate matter "is the primary source of ambient risk."

96.

23 The REIR did not consider reductions of diesel particulate matter emissions as an

24 alternative to Rule 11-18. The only alternatives considered related to Rule 11-18 were a "no action"

25 alternative and an alternative that would have set the risk threshold in Rule 11-18 at 25/M, rather

than 10/M.

26 97.

27 It is patently unreasonable to fail to consider reductions in diesel particulate matter-
86% of the risk--as an alternative to Rule 11-18 when Rule 11-18 is aimed at a set of operations
28 that, collectively, constitute only 7% of the risk that the District seeks to reduce.
19
Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief; Case No. N17-2300

98. The District violated CEQA by failing to consider reductions from other sources of

2 toxic air contaminants as an alternative to Rule 11-18 that would achieve the District's stated

3 purpose of reducing health risks in the Bay Area associated with toxic air contaminants by 20%.

4 99. The District also failed to consider an alternative commensurate with its stated goal of

5 a 20% reduction in risk, instead considering alternatives that represent 90% and 75% reductions.

6 100. For the reasons stated above, the District's adoption of Rule 11-18 failed to comply

7 with CEQA. Rule 11-18 will have significant economic, operational, and other impacts on
8 Petitioners/Plaintiffs. Petitioners/Plaintiffs have no other plain, speedy, or adequate legal remedy for

9 this harm and seek appropriate relief through this Petition and Complaint.

10 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

11 (Violations of Health and Safety Code § 40727)

12 101. Petitioners/Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference, as though fully set forth

13 herein, the allegations contained above in Paragraphs 1-100.

14 102. California Health and Safety Code 4Op 40727 imposes six specific statutory

15 requirements that must be met before the District can issue new regulations: Necessity, Authority,

16 Clarity, Consistency, Non-Duplication and Reference.

17 103. With respect to the requirement of "Necessity," the Health & Safety Code requires

18 that the "record of the rulemaking" must demonstrate the need for the new regulation with

19 "substantial evidence," which requires that the record of the rulemaking contain sufficient objective

20 information and expert opinion based on objective information to support the logical inference of the

21 "need" for the regulation. To demonstrate the "need" for a regulation, the District must make a
22 substantive showing that the regulation is not merely desirable or of potential use, but that the

23 regulation is actually "necessary" before it can be imposed on the governed.

24 104. The District has not demonstrated that Rule 11-18 is a necessary, justified, or an

25 effective measure to reduce risks related to health risks related to emissions of toxic air contaminants

26 in the Bay Area.

27 105. The stated purpose of Rule 11-18 is to "ensure that facilities that emit toxic air
28 contaminants do not pose an unacceptable health risk to nearby residents, workers, or students."
20
Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief; Case No. N17-2300

106. Rule 11-18 does not define "unacceptable health risk", and the record is silent on how

2 the District applies that term in the context of developing the Risk Action Levels and Significant
Risk Thresholds contained in Rule 11-18.

107. Section 218 of Rule 11-18 establishes "Risk Action Levels" of 25/M until 2020 and

10/M thereafter.

108. Nowhere in the record does the District explain why or how it determined that a final

7 cancer risk of 10/M is "acceptable" while a risk of 25/M or 100/M is not "acceptable."

8 109. Section 221 of Rule 11-18 defines certain "Significant Risk Thresholds" of (1) cancer

9 risk of 1.0 per million (1.0/M); (2) a chronic hazard index of 0.20; or (3) an acute hazard index of

10 0.20.

11 110. The Risk Action Levels and Significant Risk Thresholds contained in Rule 11-18

12 levels and thresholds are not supported by the record, not necessary to protect human health, and

13 based on an arbitrary and capricious decision by the District to reduce the degree of risk that it

14 deems "significant" or "acceptable" by an order of magnitude. There is no reasonable basis for this

15 decision in the record, and no explanation as to why this level of reduction is "necessary."

16 111. The District's actions and the risk levels established by Rule 11-18 run counter to

17 long-standing District and EPA policies, which establish a risk threshold of 100/M. Since the mid-

18 1970s, EPA has defined "ample margin of safety" as 100/M cancer risk, and that approach has been
19 consistently upheld as reasonable. See, e.g., Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. V. U.S.E.P.A.,

20 824 F.2d 1146 (D.C. Cir. 1987).

21 112. Congress retained the 100/M standard when it substantially revised Section 112 of the

22 federal Clean Air Act in 1990, and the D.C. Circuit has consistently rejected arguments that the

23 100/M standard should be lowered. See Natural Resources Defense Council v. E.P.A., 529 F.3d

24 1077, 1080 (D.C. Cir. 2008); see also National Association for Surface Finishing v. E.P.A., 795 F.3d

25 1, 5 (D.C. Cir. 2015).

26 113. The San Joaquin Valley Air District retained the 100/M threshold in its own response

27 to the same 2015 Health Risk Guidelines of the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment

28 that the District purports to implement through Rule 11-18.
21
Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief; Case No. N17-2300

114. Petroleum refineries are already subject to standards under Section 112 of the Clean

2 Air Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7412, that are required to protect human health with an "ample margin of

3 safety." In turn, those standards are based on EPA's risk threshold of 100/M. The District has not

4 explained why or how these standards fail to protect human health with an "ample margin of safety"

5 such that the lower thresholds established by Rule 11-18 are "necessary."

6 115. The District is obligated to demonstrate the "necessity" of its actions with real,
credible evidence in the record. That is especially true here where the available information suggests

8 that Rule 11-18 will in fact result in only minimal risk reduction because the sources covered by
Rule 11-18 account for only a small fraction of the health risks at issue, while diesel particulate

10 emissions account for 86% of the risk and the District has taken no action to address those

11 emissions. At the same time, the District estimates that all industrial and commercial operations in

12 the Bay Area collectively contribute only 7% of the health risk related to TACs. If reducing health

13 risks was truly necessary, the District would have targeted diesel particulate emissions for

14 regulation, rather than seeking a 20% reduction in 7% of the problem, or a 1.4% overall risk

15 reduction in the Bay Area. If, by its own terms, Rule 11-18 will result in a mere 1.4% reduction in

16 risk (at best), while the lion's share of risk goes unaddressed, Rule 11-18 is a priori not necessary to

17 lower health risks in the Bay Area.

18 116. The District has also failed to consider the effect of the other refinery-focused

19 it regulations it has adopted as part of its broader Refinery Strategy, many of which may result in the

20 reduction of refinery emissions and a corresponding reduction in health risks. If the effects of each

21 rule are additive, each a building block towards completing the objectives defined by the District in

22 Resolution 2014-17, then the District must consider the cumulative effects of its actions to determine

23 whether additional actions are warranted and "necessary" to reach the ultimate goal.

24 117. Given the protective nature of the risk threshold standards applicable prior to the

25 adoption of Rule 11-18, and the lack of any information suggesting that existing standards are not

26 sufficiently protective, the District has not demonstrated that reducing the level of "acceptable" risk

27 by an entire order of magnitude is necessary to fulfill the District's statutory mandate or protect the

28 public health. Even if such a drastic reduction were necessary to protect public health, Rule 11-18
22
Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief; Case No. N17-2300

P will not accomplish that goal given the very minor contribution from refineries to overall toxic air

2 contaminant risk in the Bay Area. There is no need for Rule 11-18.

3 118. By failing to make adequate findings on the record of the "necessity" of Rule 11-18,
4 the District violated California Health and Safety Code § 40727.

5 119. The "Authority" requirement requires the District to identify the provision of law that

6 permits or requires the adoption or amendment of a regulation. The requirement of "Consistency"

7 requires that the Districts regulation must be "in harmony with" and not conflicting with existing

8 laws and regulations. The "Nonduplication" requirement further requires that a regulation not

9 impose the same requirements as existing state or federal regulations, unless a showing of necessity

10 is made. The District violated all three of these requirements by adopting provisions in Rule 11-18

11 that are preempted by, conflict with, and overlap with the statewide emissions inventory mandated

12 by AB 617 and under development by the Air Resources Board. The District's reliance on an

13 independent, parallel emissions inventory in Rule 11-18 is not authorized by AB 617 and may

14 interfere with the orderly implementation of the uniform statewide system" required by AB 617. The

15 District failed to address these issues when it adopted Rule 11-18, in violation of the authority,

16 consistency, and nonduplication requirements imposed by Health and Safety Code § 40727.The

17 H&S Code also imposes an important "Clarity" requirement, which requires that a regulation is

18 written "so that its meaning can be easily understood by the persons directly affected by it." The

19 District violated this requirement in several ways when it adopted Rule 11-18. Specifically:

20 a. The key term "Significant Impact" is undefined. Section 406 of Rule 11-18 requires
updates to Risk Reduction Plans if "health risk posed a by a facility . would 21

22 significantly impact health risks to exposed persons" (emphasis added). Because the

23 term "significantly impact" is integral to the implementation of Rule 11-18 but is

24 undefined, regulated entities cannot reasonably interpret or comply with this

25 requirement.

26 b. The REIR for Rule 11-18 identifies a key objective of Rule 11-18 as "[e]nsur[ing] the

27 facilities that impact the most sensitive and overburdened communities reduce their

28
23
Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief; Case No. N17-2300

1 associated health risk in an efficient and expeditious manner." Neither the REIR nor

2 Rule 11-18 define what constitutes an "overburdened community."

c v Section 101 of Rule 11-18 provides that "[t]he purpose of this rule is to ensure that
facilities that emit toxic air contaminants do not pose an unacceptable health risk to

U nearby residents, workers, or students." Despite the repeated use of the term

6 "unacceptable health risk" in the rule and other District materials, such as the REIR

7 and Staff Report, the District fails to identify the term "unacceptable health risk."

8 120. The District's failure to define integral terms that form the basis of Rule 11-18 is a

9 plain breach of the "clarity" requirement of Health and Safety Code § 40727.

10 121. The District further violated the "clarity" requirement of Health and Safety Code :

11 40727 by failing to define the term "Health Risk Assessment."

12 122. The applicability of Rule 11-18 depends entirely on the District's calculation of a

13 facility's health risk, based on a Health Risk Assessment conducted by the District. But nowhere in

[4 the rule or its supporting materials does the District explain exactly how it will conduct those Health

15 Risk Assessments. Instead, Rule 11-18 provides the following vague definition of "Health Risk
16 Assessment": "An analysis that estimates the potential for increased likelihood of health risk for

17 individuals in the affected population that may be exposed to emissions of one or more toxic air
18 contaminants, determined in accordance with Rule 2-5, Section 2-5-603." That rule, in turn

19 references the District's Air Toxics New Source Review Program Health Risk Assessment

20 Guidelines. Those Guidelines in turn cross-reference 2015 Health Risk Assessment Guidelines

21 published by California's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment ("OEHHA"). And

22 OEHHA's Guidelines themselves cross-reference yet more documents, None of these documents

23 provide a cohesive, understandable definition of what the District means by a "Health Risk

24 Assessment" in the context of Rule 11-18.

25 123. Under the "Clarity" requirement, a regulation must be written "so that its meaning

26 can be easily understood by the persons directly affected by it." On its face, Rule 11-18 does not

27 describe how the District will conduct Health Risk Assessments with sufficient clarity to allow

28 regulated entities to anticipate or replicate those calculations.
24
Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief; Case No. N17-2300

- 124. The District's violation of the clarity requirement of Health and Safety Code § 40727

2 is no mere paper violation. Instead, a lack of clarity-or any definition at all-with respect to core

3 provisions or Rule 11-18 severely limits the ability of regulated entities to understand, plan for, and

4 comply with the requirements of Rule 11-18.

5 125. For these and other reasons stated above, the District's adoption of Rule 11-18

6 violated Health and Safety Code § 40727. Rule 11-18 will have significant economic, operational,

7 and other impacts on Petitioners/Plaintiffs. Petitioners/Plaintiffs have no other plain, speedy, or

8 adequate legal remedy for this harm and seek appropriate relief through this Petition and Complaint.

9 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

10 (Rule 11-18 is Arbitrary and Capricious)

11 126. Petitioners/Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference, as though fully set forth
12 herein, the allegations contained above in Paragraphs 1-125, inclusive.

13 127. District actions that are "arbitrary, capricious, entirely lacking in evidentiary support,

14 unlawful, or procedurally unfair" are illegal and void. Am. Coatings Ass'n v. S. Coast Air Quality

15 Dist. (2012) 54 Cal.4th 446, 460.

16 128. The mandate of Resolution 2014-17-a 20% reduction in health risks from refinery
17 TACsis itself arbitrary and capricious. That objective, which forms the basis of Rule 11-18, is

18 mere agency fiat, lacking in any reasoned basis in fact. Alone, the arbitrary objective of Rule 11-18

19 begs the question of whether Rule 11-18 and rest of the Refinery Project is little more than a

20 capricious exercise in political expediency aimed at a visible industry in the Bay Area.

21 129. The District's adoption of Rule 11-18 itself was demonstrably arbitrary, capricious,

22 entirely lacking in evidentiary support, unlawful, and procedurally unfair.

23 130. As described above, Section 218 of Rule 11-18 establishes a final "Risk Action

24 Level" of 10/M and Section 221 defines certain "Significant Risk Thresholds." These Risk Action

25 Levels and Significant Risk Thresholds are the cornerstone of Rule 11-18 and the driver of all other
26 substantive requirements imposed by the rule.

27 131. The District violated the H&S Code by failing to demonstrate on the record that the

28 Risk Action Levels and Significant Risk Thresholds are "necessary" to achieve the District's
25
Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief; Case No. N17-2300

1 ultimate objective of reducing Bay Area health risk by 20%. The District provides no reasoning

2 with respect to why a 10/M cancer risk is "acceptable" while a risk of 100/M is not, despite the fact

3 that EPA regulations based on a 100/M threshold apply to Bay Area refineries and already protect

4 human health with an "ample margin of safety." For the same reasons, the District's action in

5 establishing a final Risk Action Level of 10/M is arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion.

6 132. While the agency may change its mind with respect to a given regulation or policy, it

7 must clearly explain and support its rationale for that change. Here, the District has failed to explain

8 why the risk thresholds of 10/M and 25/M contained in Rule 11-18 are appropriate given that they

9 represent a severe departure from the District's prior 100/M threshold, as well as a radical departure

10 from long-standing policy of the EPA and other air districts. This "unexplained inconsistency" with

11 prior policy is alone a sufficient reason for finding a regulation arbitrary and capricious. Encino

12 Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 136 S.Ct. 2117, 2126 (2016).

13 133. Nowhere in the record has the District provided any explanation demonstrating why it

14 is now necessary to reduce its longstanding risk threshold-one also endorsed by the EPA and

15 Congress-by an order of magnitude. On its face, the District's decision to lower residual risk

16 thresholds, without providing a reasoned explanation for that decision, appears arbitrary and

17 capricious.

18 134. The District's adoption of Rule 11-18 is arbitrary, capricious and not supported by

19 evidence in the record. Those actions harm Petitioners/Plaintiffs because Rule 11-18 will have

20 significant economic, operational, and other impacts on Petitioners/Plaintiffs. Petitioners/Plaintiffs

21 have no other plain, speedy, or adequate legal remedy for this harm and seek appropriate relief

22 through this Petition and Complaint.

23 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

24 (Violation of California Health and Safety Code § 40703)

25 135. Petitioners/Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference, as though fully set forth

26 herein, the allegations contained above in Paragraphs 1-134, inclusive.

27 136. California Health and Safety Code § 40703 requires that, in adopting any regulation,

28 the District must "consider, pursuant to Section 40922, and make available to the public, its findings
26
Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief; Case No. N17-2300

related to the cost effectiveness of a control measure, as well as the basis for the findings and the

2 considerations involved. A district shall make reasonable efforts, to the extent feasible within

3 existing budget constraints, to make specific reference to the direct costs expected to be incurred by

4 regulated parties, including businesses and individuals."

5 137. Rule 11-18 establishes an arbitrary and unprecedented risk level of 10/M. Even if

6 this level of risk were scientifically justified, necessary to protect human health, and supported by

7 the record (none of which is true) achieving the 10/M threshold established by Rule 11-18 is

8 glaringly not cost-effective. The District failed to adequately evaluate the cost effectiveness of Rule

9 11-18 in several important ways:

10 a. The District did not assess the cost-effectiveness of increasing the risk threshold to

11 25/M or higher, or assess the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of a 25/M threshold as

12 compared to a 100/M threshold. Nor did the District assess the incremental costs and

13 benefits of lowering the threshold from 25/M to 10/M.

14 b. The District did not evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Rule 11-18 against the cost

15 effectiveness of other alternatives to reducing health risk from TACs in the Bay Area,

16 such as reducing diesel particulate emissions, which the District admits are

17 responsible for 86% of total risk.

18 C. The District failed to identify and assess all forms of control technologies and account

19 for the cost of their installation and operation.

20 138. The District further failed to consider the cumulative impacts of Rule 11-18 with the

21 set of five additional rules recently adopted by the District and additional new rules that the District

22 has stated it intends to propose as part of its Refinery Project. The District has not considered the
23 cumulative costs of complying with so many new substantive requirements within a 5-year (or in

24 some cases, shorter) window. The record offers no discussion of the resource constraints associated

25 with developing multiple new compliance programs within the same time period and does not
26 analyze the economic feasibility of the capital expenditures required to comply with these rules,

27 a within a narrow timeframe.

28 139. By failing to conduct an accurate, thorough, unbiased, and otherwise appropriate cost
27
Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief; Case No. N17-2300

b effectiveness analysis for Rule 11-18 by itself and in conjunction with the other rules comprising the

2 Refinery Strategy, the District violated California Health and Safety Code § 40703. That violation

3 harms Petitioners/Plaintiffs because Rule 11-18 will have significant economic, operational, and

4 other impacts on Petitioners/Plaintiffs. Petitioners/Plaintiffs have no other plain, speedy, or adequate

5 legal remedy for this harm and seek appropriate relief through this Petition and Complaint.

6 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

7 (Federal and California Law Preempt Any Provisions of Rule 11-18 That Encompass Cargo Carrier Emissions) 8

9 140. Petitioners/Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference, as though fully set forth

10 herein, the allegations contained above in Paragraphs 1-139, inclusive.

141. The District has no authority to regulate cargo carriers. Rule 11-18 is not clear as to 11

12 the scope and extent of the emissions inventories and other information forming the basis for the

13 District's Health Risk Assessments. To the extent that rule 11-18 requires inclusion of cargo carrier

14 emissions within emissions inventories, that requirement is preempted by state and fcdcral law.

15 142. The Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act ("ICCTA") includes an

16 express preemption clause that grants the Surface Transportation Board (*STB") exclusive
17 jurisdiction over rail carriers, including among other things, rail carrier operations, rail transportation

18 of goods, and the practices of rail carriers. 49 U.S.C. § 10501(b)(1)-(2). The "practices" and

19 "operations" of rail carriers encompass their emissions and data reporting. The ICCTA preempts all

20 state laws that have the effect of managing or governing rail transportation, including any state or

21 local law purporting to regulate emissions from trains.

22 143. The California Health & Safety Code expressly prohibits the District from regulating

23 emissions from locomotives. H&S Code § 40720.

24 144. The Federal Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. §7401 et seq., preempts California regulations

25 related to emissions from ocean-going vessels.

26 145. The District's inability to regulate cargo carrier emissions is further underscored by

27 various California laws that expressly grant authority over the transportation of goods to other

28 agencies. See, e.g., H&SC §§ 39625 et seq., §§ 39630-32, § 29625.02(c), § 39631(a).
28
Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief; Case No. N17-2300

- 146. To the extent that any provision of Rule 11-18 encompasses trains, rail carriers, or
2 marine vessels, and/or their operations, practices, or emissions, such provision is preempted by the

3

4 ICCTA, H&S Code § 40720, the Clean Air Act, and other state and federal laws.

147.

5 The District's adoption of such provisions as part of Rule 11-18 will have significant

6 economic, operational, and other impacts on Petitioners/Plaintiffs. Petitioners/Plaintiffs have no

7 other plain, speedy, or adequate legal remedy for this harm and seeks appropriate relief through this
Petition and Complaint.

8 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

9

10 (Rule 11-18 is void for vagueness)

148.

11 Petitioners/Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference, as though fully set forth
herein, the allegations contained above in Paragraphs 1-147, inclusive.

12 149.

13 Because Rule 11-18 contains numerous vague or undefined terms, including vital

14 provisions related to triggering applicability of Rule 11-18, it violates due process and is void for

vagueness.

15 150. The due process protections of the 5th and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution
16 demand that a law or regulation is void for vagueness when it fails to clearly define what the law

17

18 requires. As the U.S. Supreme Court has explained, "we insist that laws give the person of ordinary

19 intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act

20 accordingly. Vague laws may trap the innocent by not providing fair warning." Grayned v. City of
Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108 (1972).

21 151.

22 California law also requires that "[c]ivil as well as criminal statutes must be

23 sufficiently clear as to give a fair warning of the conduct prohibited, and they must provide a

24 standard or guide against which conduct can be uniformly judged by courts and administrative

25 agencies." Morrison v. State Board of Education (1969) 1 Cal.3d 214, 219.

152.

26 The applicability of Rule 11-18 depends on the District's calculation of a "Health

27 Risk Assessment" but Rule 11-18 does not define "Health Risk Assessment" or explain how the

28 District will conduct those assessments. Nowhere in the rule or its supporting materials does the
District explain exactly how it will conduct those Health Risk Assessments. There is no way for a
29
Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief; Case No. N17-2300

P person or entity subject to Rule 11-18 to anticipate or replicate the District's analysis determining

2 what requirements may apply to that person or entity.

3 153. Rule 11-18, and the record supporting the rule, further fail to define "Significant
4 Impact," "overburdened community," "unacceptable health risk," and other vital terms.

5 154. Rule 11-18 does not give refineries and other entities or persons subject to the rule "a

6 fair warning of the conduct prohibited."

7 155. Rule 11-18 also fails to "provide a standard or guide against which conduct can be

8 uniformly judged by courts and administrative agencies," leaving the District with unfettered and

9 overly broad discretion to impose requirements or find violations under Rule 11-18.

10 156. These failings offend due process and render Rule 11-18 void for vagueness. The

11 District's adoption of Rule 11-18 will have significant economic, operational, and other impacts on

12 Petitioners/Plaintiffs. Petitioners/Plaintiffs have no other plain, speedy, or adequate legal remedy for

13 this harm and seek appropriate relief through this Petition and Complaint.

14 EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (Violation of the California APA, H&S Code, and CEQA for Failure to Disclose Regulatory Provisions to the Public in Advance of Adoption)
16

17 157. Petitioner/Plaintiff re-allege and incorporate by reference, as though fully set forth

18 herein, the allegations contained above in Paragraphs 1-156, inclusive.

19 158. Immediately before Rule 11-18 was adopted, and with no prior public notice, the

20 District for the first time notified the public that it intended to establish an entirely new "Dispute

21 Resolution Panel" to address any disputes over the proper interpretation of Rule 11-18 or the

22 appropriate emissions data used by any individual refinery. Nowhere in any of the materials

23 provided to the public did the District identify what this "Dispute Resolution Panel" was, or explain

24 how it would work, how Board members would be selected, or how the decisions made by this

25 Board may affect the District's decisions and Petitioners' legal rights.

26 159. The District further announced, immediately before adopting Rule 11-18, that it plans

27 to create a "Tracking and Implementation Workgroup" comprised of various stakeholders that will

28
30
Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief; Case No. N17-2300

"meet to discuss issues related to rule implementation, receive periodic reports from the Dispute
2 Resolution Panel, and otherwise review implementation of the Proposed Rule with District staff."

3 160. Nowhere in any of the materials provided to the public did the District identify how

4 this "Tracking and Implementation Workgroup" would "review implementation" of Rule 11-18,

5 guide or review District actions, or otherwise oversee the District's "Dispute Resolution Panel."

6 161. The District memorialized and adopted these provisions within Board's Resolution
7 2017-11, the document in which the District adopted Rule 11-18.

8 162. Rather than including significant provisions within Resolution 2017-11, the District

9 should have included them within the rule itself and provided the public with an opportunity to
10 meaningfully participate in the District's deliberative process relating to these provisions. The

I1 District could have included provisions related to the dispute resolution process, the Dispute

12 Resolution Panel, and the Tracking and Implementation Workgroup in its proposed drafts of Rule

13 11-18, provided for public comment, then considered those comments prior to adopting the

14 provisions, but did not.

15 163. The District's actions violate the California APA, Government Code, § 11340 et seq.

16 by failing to inform the public and provide an opportunity to comment in advance of adopting

17 provisions that will directly impact the implementation of Rule 11-18. California Government Code

18 11346.8(c) prohibits adopting regulations that have been changed from the version originally made

19 available to the public, unless the change is nonsubstantial or sufficiently related to the original

20 proposal to put the public on notice of the potential change. Here, the first mention of the new

21 provisions implementing Rule 11-18 came at the very meeting at which it the rule was adopted, in

22 plain violation of basic rulemaking requirements.

23 164. H&SC § The District's actions also violate the Health & Safety Code. Specifically,

24 40725 requires the District to provide at least 30 days' prior notice of any proposed new or amended

25 regulations; that notice must include a copy of the proposed rule, a summary description of the effect

26 of the rule, and an invitation to public comment. H&SC § 40726 further prohibits the District from

27 adopting a proposed rule at the scheduled hearing if it makes changes "that are so substantial as to

28 significantly affect the meaning of the proposed rule or regulation." In this event, the District is
31
Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief; Case No. N17-2300

] required to delay adoption until its next regular meeting and allow additional opportunity to

2 comment on these new provisions. Notwithstanding significant changes made to the proposed

c regulations in Resolution 2017-11, the District nevertheless adopted these new provisions at the

4 same meeting at which they were first brought to the attention of the public, in plain violation of

5 H&SC 40725-26.

6 165. By relying on a document and or/information that was not made available to the
7 public before the meeting or in the RDEIR, the District's actions further violate Public Resources

8 Code § 21092 and CEQA Guidelines § 15087. The significant new provisions first announced in

9 Board Resolution 2017-11 adopting Rule 11-18 on November 15, 2017 did not come out of thin air.

10 Upon reason and belief, Petitioners/Plaintiffs believe that the District had document(s) describing the

11 utilization and process for the Tracking and Implementation Workgroup and the Dispute Resolution

12 Panel in order to include such language in the Board Resolution 2017-11. This information that was

13 not made available to the public in advance of the meeting thereby depriving the public of a

14 reasonable opportunity to review and comment. The District committed a prejudicial abuse of

15 discretion and failed to comply with CEQA when the District, upon information and belief, relied

16 on a document that was not made available for public review in advance of the meeting.

17 166. The District's adoption of provisions in Resolution 2017-11 directly impacting the
18 implementation of Rule 11-18 will have significant economic, operational, and other impacts on

19 Petitioners/Plaintiffs. Petitioners/Plaintiff s has no other plain, speedy, or adequate legal remedy for

20 this harm and seeks appropriate relief through this Petition and Complaint.

21 NINTH CAUSE OF ACTION
(AB 617 Preempts Rule 11-18) 22 167. Petitioner/Plaintiff re-allege and incorporate by reference, as though fully set forth 23

24 herein, the allegations contained above in Paragraphs 1-166, inclusive.

168. AB 617 was signed into law on July 26, 2017. AB 617 addresses the subject of Rule 25 11-18: the reduction of toxic air contaminant emissions and the reduction of related
26
health risks.
27
169.
28 AB 617 expressly grants to ARB the authority to "establish a uniform statewide

32
Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief; Case No. N17-2300

1

2 system of annual reporting of emissions of criteria pollutants and toxic air contaminants
for a stationary source." AB 617 further requires ARB to prepare these inventories "in

D consultation with [air] districts" and requires annual reporting to ARB "using the uniform

statewide system of annual reporting."
ü 170.

6 The District's reliance on an independent, parallel emissions inventory in Rule 11-18

7 is not authorized by AB 617, usurps ARB's authority to implement AB 617, and may

8 interfere with the orderly implementation of the "uniform statewide system" required by

AB 617.

9 171.

10 AB 617 preempts Rule 11-18 to the extent that Rule 11-18 would create or rely on a

11 duplicate and/or parallel emissions inventory for preparation of health risk assessments or

12 any other purpose related to the implementation of Rule 11-18.

c 172. The District failed to address these issues when it adopted Rule 11-18, in violation of

14 the authority, consistency, and nonduplication requirements imposed by Health and
Safety Code § 40727.

15 173.

16 The District's adoption of Rule 11-18 which will have significant economic,

17 operational, and other impacts on Petitioner/Plaintiff. Petitioner/Plaintiff has no other

18 plain, speedy, or adequate legal remedy for this harm and seek appropriate relief through
this Petition and Complaint.

19 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

20

21 WHEREFORE, Petitioners/Plaintiffs pray for judgment and further relief as follows:

1.

22 For a peremptory writ of mandate ordering the District to:

9 5. For declaratory relief declaring that Rule 11-18 is preempted by state and federal law,

10 is beyond the scope of the District's authority, and constitutes an illegal ultra vires action to the

11 extent it encompasses cargo carriers;

12 6. For declaratory relief declaring that Rule 11-18 is preempted by AB 617, to the extent

13 that Rule 11-18 usurps authority granted exclusively to ARB and/or interferes with the

14 implementation of AB 617;

15 7. For declaratory relief declaring that Rule 11-18 is void for vagueness and

16 unenforceable;

17 8. For declaratory relief declaring that the District's adoption of new regulatory

18 provisions as part of Resolution 2017-11 violation of the APA, the Health & Safety Code, and

19 CEQA was unlawful, null, void, and unenforceable;

20 9. For declaratory relief declaring that issuance of the REIR and NOD for Rule 11-18

21 was unlawful, null, void, and unenforceable;

22 10. For injunctive relief prohibiting the District from enforcing any provision Rule 11-18

23 or Resolution 2017-11;

24 11. For injunctive relief prohibiting the District from enforcing or implementing any

1 VERIFICATION

2 I am an attorney for Petitioners/Plaintiffs Western States Petroleum Association, Valero

3 Refining Company-California, Tesoro Refining & Marketing Co., and Phillips 66 Company in this

4 action. I make this verification on behalf of Petitioners/Plaintiffs because such parties and their

5 representatives are absent from the county in which my office is located. have read the foregoing

6 Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief and Injunctive Relief

7 and know its contents. The facts therein alleged are true and correct to the best of my knowledge
