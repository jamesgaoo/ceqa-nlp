VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 Petitioner, FIGHT BACK, VENICE! ("Petitioner'), alleges through this Verified Petition
2 for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declarative and Injunctive Relief ("Petition"), as follows:
3 INTRODUCTION

1. Petitioner challenges the approvals by Respondent City of Los Angeles ("City" or
5 "Respondent") of two new land use ordinances passed simultaneously with the goal of providing
6 shelter and supportive housing for Los Angeles homeless population. Ordinance No. 185492
7 titled the "Permanent Supporting Housing Ordinance" ("PSHO") and Ordinance No. 185489 the
8 "Interim Hotel Conversion Ordinance" ("IMCO") were both adopted by the Los Angeles City
9 Council on April 11, 2018 to provide the City and real estate developers with streamlined
10 approval methods; environmental review exemptions; and other land use concessions in
11
ยง exchange for building projects designed to shelter and support Los Angeles growing homeless d77 41Z06 Auerea L0 MONE MH MASI MA BOZ8 12 population (the "Project").
13 2. The Project was not subjected to adequate environmental review under the
14 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). As supporting environmental documentation,
15 the City certified a Mitigated Negative Declaration (*MND") for the PSHO : Negative
16 Declaration ("MND") for the IMCO and an addendum to the Programmatic Environmental
17 Impact Report ("PEIR") prepared for the Regional Transportation Plan (the "Environmental
18 Review Documents.") The Environmental Review Documents were legally inadequate because
19 A) A full environmental impact report ("EIR") was required to be prepared but was not; B) the
20 Project was improperly analyzed as two separate actions; C) the Project precommitted the city to
21 a further project requiring environmental review which was not reviewed resulting in improper
22 piecemealing; and D) the individual Environmental Review Documents themselves were legally
23 defective for various procedural and substantive reasons.
24 3. Petitioner requests that this Court vacate, set aside, rescind and void all of the
25 Environmental Review Documents, actions, resolutions, ordinances, amendments and findings
26 related to the Project. The Project was approved by the City of Los Angeles on or about April 11,
27

28 2

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 2018. Petitioner requests that the Court vacate the Project because Respondent failed to comply
2 with the provisions set forth under the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources
3 Code section 21000, et seq. ("CEQA"), the State Planning and Zoning Law, and local laws and
therefore failed to proceed in a manner required by law.

4. Petitioner seeks a Peremptory Writ of Mandate under California Code of Civil

6 Procedure section 1094.5, directing Respondent to vacate, rescind and set aside all Project
7 Approvals and the certification of the EIR because Respondent failed to comply with CEQA and
8 applicable State Planning and Zoning Laws.
9 PARTIES

10 5. Petitioner, FIGHT BACK, VENICE!, formerly known as Venice Vision, is an

13 beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondent complies with laws relating to environmental
14 protection. Petitioner and its respective members are adversely affected by Respondents' failure
15 to comply with CEQA in approving the Project. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims
16 raised in this Petition because Petitioner and its members' aesthetic and environmental interests

17 are directly and adversely affected by Respondent's' approval of the Project.
18 6. Respondent, City of Los Angeles, is charter city incorporated under the laws of
19 the State of California. The City is the lead agency is under CEQA.

23 Real Parties in Interest. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that each
24 Respondent designated herein as a DOE has some responsibility for the events and happenings

3 MND, ND and Addendum and approved the Project.

15. On or about April 11, 2018, the City filed a Notice of Determination (*NOD")
with the County Recorder.

6 CEQA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS

7 16. In 1970, the California Legislature enacted CEQA, as a means of forcing public
8 agency decision makers, such as Respondent, to document and consider the environmental
9 implications of its actions. CEQA's fundamental goal is to fully inform the public and the
10 decision makers as to the environmental consequences of proposed projects and to assure
11 members of the public that their elected officials are making informed decisions. CEQA requires 00E S LIZ06 'SI!H 2A08 VPANE UHLSIMA COZ8 Beverly 12 governmental authorities, such as Respondent, to fully evaluate potential environmental effects Channel Law Group, 13 of projects, and to seek feasible means to reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that
14 otherwise could result from their actions. CEQA limits agencies from approving projects with
15 significant adverse impacts when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen such impacts.
16 17. If a project will not result in potentially significant effects on the environment, the
17 government agency may prepare a negative declaration. Mitigated negative declarations are

18 prepared when a project applicant revises a project to eliminate or avoid all significant impacts
19 by incorporating mitigation measures into the project. A proposed mitigated negative
20 declaration circulated for review and comment must describe the project as modified to
21 incorporate mitigation measures. Mitigation measures cannot be improperly deferred and must
22 eliminate or avoid all significant environmental impacts of the project. An agency adopting a
23 mitigated negative declaration must provide members of the public, as well as responsible
24 agencies and trustee agencies with notice of its intention to adopt the mitigated negative
25 declaration. An agency adopting a mitigated negative declaration must also adopt a mitigation
26 monitoring or reporting program for the mitigation measures incorporated into the negative
27

5 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

declaration.

18. Where substantial evidence in the record of proceedings before the lead agency
supports a "fair argument" that one or more significant environmental effects could occur as a
result of approval and implementation of a project CEQA requires preparation of an
environmental impact report ("EIR"). The primary function of the EIR is to discuss the
important environmental consequences of the project, including cumulative effects, and to
7 provide the agency and the general public with mitigation measures and alternatives to the
8 project that would have Jess serious environmental consequences. A lead agency is required to
9 consult with responsible agencies in determining whether an EIR shall be prepared. Responsible
10 agencies are public agencies which propose to carry out or approve a project, for which the lead
11 agency is preparing or has prepared an EIR or negative declaration. ยง Channel Law Group, d77 a LIZ06 12 19. Under CEQA, lead agencies, such as Respondent, are required to prepare a

8 euNS "pA8 BJIySI!M 0OZ8 13 complete and legally adequate EIR prior to approving any discretionary project that may have
'SIlIH AueAeg 14 significant adverse effect on the environment. The EIR must fully disclose and adequately
15 analyze the project's potentially significant environmental effects. CEQA also requires lead
16 agencies, such as Respondent, to consider mitigation measures and alternatives to a project,
17 adopt all feasible mitigation measures and/or alternatives, determine whether proposed
18 mitigation measures will be effective in avoiding or substantially lessening the project's
19 significant environmental impacts, and to make adequate findings, including an adequate
20 statement of overriding consideration for those significant environmental impacts deemed
21 unavoidable. Lead agencies, such as Respondent, may not avoid the duty to prepare an EIR by
22 segmenting a project into several smaller projects.
23 20. When a government agency adopts a negative declaration, mitigated negative
24 declaration or an EIR, it must exercise its independent judgment and analysis.

1 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
2 (The Environmental Review for the Project was Legally Inadequate under CEQA)
3 21. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
4 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

5 22. CEQA requires a lead agency for a project to prepare environmental

6 documentation that complies with the requirements of the statute. The lead agency must also

7 provide for public review and comment on the project and associated environmental
8 documentation. CEQA is designed to provide sufficient environmental analysis such that
9 decision-makers can intelligently consider environmental consequences when acting on proposed
10 projects.

11

25 review.

exemption.
v. Inadequately addressed the environmental consequences of, possible
mitigation measures for, and potential alternatives to the Project.
vi. Did not adequately address issues raised by public comments,
including all other issues mentioned herein.

6 24. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion
by certifying Environmental Review Documents that do not comply with CEQA and by
approving the Project in reliance thereon. Accordingly, Respondent's certification of the
9 Environmental Review Documents and approval of the Project must be set aside.
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION 10

19 29. Petitioner has no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy at law, and will suffer
20 irreparable injury unless it receives the relief requested in this Petition.
21 30. An actual controversy exists between Petitioner and Respondents as to whether
22 the actions and conduct of Respondents alleged in this Petition have violated CEQA and other
23 laws as identified herein. This controversy implicates the legality of the manner in which
24 Respondents have proceeded in giving the Project Approvals, the validity of the Respondents'
25 actions with respect thereto and, consequently, the legal ability of Respondents to take further
26 actions to develop the Project based upon the Project Approvals. The Petitioner contends that
27

each and all such actions and conduct have violated and will violate these laws. Petitioner is

2 informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that Respondents dispute these contentions. A
3 judicial resolution of that controversy is now required pursuant to California Code of Civil
Procedure section 1060.

5 31. Petitioner requests a judicial declaration that Respondents' actions and conduct

6 alleged in this Petition have violated and will violate CEQA and other laws identified herein.

Impact Report; Council File 17-0422, 17-1432; ENV-2017-3137-MND; ENV-2017-

et al.

Honorable Attorney General Becerra:

Enclosed please find a copy of the Petition for Writ of Mandate filed by Fight Back, Venice!, formerly known as Venice Vision. The Petition alleges, inter alia, that the City erroneously determined that Permanent Supportive Housing Ordinance (No. 185492) and Motel Conversion Ordinance (No. 185489) would have no significant effects on the environment. The
Petition also challenges the Addendum to the Southern California Association of Government's
2016-2040 RTP/SCS Programmatic Environmental Impact Report ("PEIR") on the grounds that
it is non-complaint with CEQA. The City Council of the City of Los Angeles approved the
Ordinances and the Addendum on or about April 11, 2018.

Please call if you have any questions.

Sincerely, Q-Al
Jamie T. Hall

Enclosure: Petition for Writ of Mandate
