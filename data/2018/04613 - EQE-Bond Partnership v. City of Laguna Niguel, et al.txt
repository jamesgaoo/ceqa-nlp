Dept: CX105

20 Petitioner and Plaintiff BQR-Bond Partnership ("EQR") alleges as follows:

1. INTRODUCTION
EQR brings this action because Respondent and Defendant City of Laguna Niguel
21| (City" or "Laguna") violated California law and its own Municipal Code by approving improper,
22| unauthorized permit parking districts within the City in the vicinity of Windridge Apartments, a
23 large apartment complex owned by EQR, which parking districts improperly distinguish and
24 discriminate against residents of Windridge and other apartment complexes in the City by
25 depriving them of their right to park on City streets, in violation of Vehicle Code Section 22507.
26 As recently confirmed by the Attorncy General of the State of California, a City cannot

28 27 discriminate against residents of aparlments in connection a with a permit parking district.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE FOR VIOLATION OF
CEQA, & COMPLAINT FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION & DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF VEHICLE CODE, LAGUNA NIGUEL MUNICIPAL CODE &

2. The City additionally violated and failed to comply with the Vehicle Code and the
2 City's Municipal Code through its approval of the permit parking districts because the evidence
3 and information considered by the City does not establish that approval of the permit parking
districts was roasonable and necossary, and does not indicate that there were "parking problems"
within the areas included within the permit parking districts which "substantially interfere[d] with
the normal and expected use of available public street parking spaces at regular daily or weekly
intervals." (Laguna Niguel Municipal Code § 7-4-607(a).) The City also failed to give the
8 required ten-days' notice prior to approval of the permit parking districts, and failed to hold a
9 hearing in connection with the districts. (Vehicle Code § 22507.5.) The approval of the two
10 permit parking districts also violates and is contrary to the City's General Plan.
11 3. EQR also brings this action because the City violated the California Environmental
12| Quality Act ("CEQA") (Public Resources Code §5 21000 et seq.) by approving permit parking
13 districts which deprive City residents, in particular apartment dwellers, of their right to use the
14| public streets and roads of the City without undertaking any review of the environmental impacts
15 of the approval of the parking districts and imposition of additional parking limits on City streets.
16 The City instead attempted to rely on inapplicable and improper categorical exemptions. The
17| City's reliance on categorical exemptions to avoid CEQA review is additionally improper because
18 the permit parking districts will have a significant impact on the environment, thus requiring
19| proper and complete review of the permit parking districts pursuant to CEQA.
20 4. The City additionally violated CEQA by attempting to impose broad parking
21 restrictions, including restrictions which deprive City residents of the right to use City streets and
22 roads, through smaller, separate permit parking districts, instead of a previously proposed City-
23| wide permit parking program, in an attempt to avoid compliance with CEQA by "piecemcaling,"
24 or segmenting, a larger project into sinaller, separate components.
25 5. The City's violations of the Vehicle Code, the Municipal Code, the General Plan,
26 and CEQA threatens damage and irreparable harm to EQR, and residents of the City, including
27| residents of Windridge and other apartment complexes in the City, and to the environment.
28 Among other things, the City's violations of the Vehicle Code, the Municipal Code, the General 2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE FOR VIOLATION OF VERICLE CODE, LAOUNA NIGUEL MUNICIPAL CODE & CEQA, & COMPLAINT FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION & DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Plan, and CEQA will cause significant harm and prejudice to EQR and residents of Windridge by
2| forcing residents of the City to park far from their homes and expose themselves to considerable
3| public safely risk and harm by walking on City streets late at night in isolated and deserted areas,
by depriving City residents of their right and ability to use and park on City streets where there is
5 available parking for residents, by changing and disrupting parking palterns in and around the
City, and by reducing the value of the Windridge property and rendering it less desirable to
tenants, particularly tenants with children, and larger families. The actions of the City will have
8 related significant impacts on traffic, public transportation, greenhouse gas emissions, air quality,
9 cultural resources, City services, land use and planning patterns, noise, recreation, and public
10 safety. The permit parking districts will have additional impacts on surrounding areas by reducing
11 and condensing available parking in the City and by shifing a large part of the available parking 12 areas and vehicle traffic areas to new areas outside the parking districts. 13 6. Through this action, EQR secks a writ of mandate barring the City from
14 implementing or enforcing the permit parking districts or from improperly depriving certain City
15 residents from proper use of City streets, including public parking spaces on City streets, based on
16 the City's violations of the Vehicle Code, Municipal Code, and General Plan, and barring the City
17 from implementing any new permit parking districts or parking restrictions without subjecting
review pursuant to CEQA. BQR 18 approval of the districts to proper and complete environmental
19 also seeks monetary damages against the City for its improper "taking" of EQR's property without
20 compensation.

21 7. EQR and Windridge residents will suffer immediate and irreparable harm if the
22| Court does not grant EQR its requested relief. EQR therefore also seeks a preliminary and
23| permanent injunction barring the City from undertaking any activity to implement or enforce the
24 two new permit parking districts, or to take any other action to limit and deprive City residents of
25 the right to use and park on City streets, unless and until the City has complied with the Vehicle
26 Code, the Municipal Code, and the Gencral Plan, and unless and until it has subjected any new
27| permit parking districts or parking restrictions to proper and complete review pursuant to CEQA.

8. This proceeding involves enforcement of important rights affecting the public
2| interest. Tssuance of the relief requested in this Petition and Complaint will confer a substantial
3 benefit on the public, including citizens, residents, businesses and taxpayers of the City, and will
result in the enforcement of important public rights by requiring the City to comply with the
5 Vehiole Code, the Municipal Code, the General Plan, and CEQA, and other legal requirements
applicable to the adoption of permit parking districts and other parking restrictions, and
7 prohibiting the City from taking any action with respect to permit parking districts or limitations
8 on parking until it has complied with those legal requirements.

CEQA, & COMPLAINT FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION & DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

concerns with the proposed permit parking districts and other efforts to limit and restrict use of

3 the April 3, 2018 meeting of the City Council wherein the City approved the permit parking

4 districts.

5 17. The City did not hold any public hearings with regard to the permit parking
6 districts and did not give members of the public an opportunity to raise objections orally or in
writing prior to approval of the permit parking districts, and the City failed to give timely or
8 sufficient notice required by law. (Public Resources Code § 21177(e); Vehicle Code 22507.5.)

18 in violation of state law, the General Plan, and the Municipal Code.

26 23. On May 8, 2018, prior to commencement of this action, EQR served written notice

17 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
18 Windridge Background
19 28. Windridge is located to the south of Hidden Hills Road and to the east of Niguel
20 Ranch Road in the City.

21 29, EQR acquired Windridge on November 16, 1994 a8 part of a larger portfolio of 26
22 apartment buildings (7321 units) acquired from Executive Life Insurance Company, EQR has
23| complied with all applicable zoning and land üse requirements with regard to Windridge,
24| including all requirements and conditions regarding parking.
25 30. Windridge contains 344 separate apartments with 344 single-car garages. There are
26 297 additional parking spaces onsite, including five disabled parking spaccs. Windridge's
27| apartments are a mix of two- and a three-bedroom apartment homes. There are 72 three-bedroom
28 units and 272 two-bedroom units. The property is typically 94% to 98% occupied. 7
VERIFIED PETTION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE FOR VIOLATION OF VEHICLE CODE, LAGUNA NIQUEL MUNICIPAL CODE &
CEQA, & COMPLAINT FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION & DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

31. Windridge has developed and implemented an on-site parking program
administered by Windridge staff. Windridge residents are required to register all vehicles that will
3 be parked on-site with the Windridge office upon move in or change in ownership, Each
apartment is assigned a spocific garage. There must be room for a car to park in a garage at all
times; they cannot be used solely for storage. Motorcycle parking is prohibited in garage, unless
a car can also be parked in the garage. Windridge staff make quarterly garage inspections and
regularly observe and monitor garages to make sure they can still be used for parking. Residents
8 that consistently violate the parking and garage rules are not given the opportunity to renew their
9 leases at Windridge.
10 32. Fach Windridge home is eligible for parking permits from Windridge for the non-
11 garage parking spaces in the Windridge common space. Permit hours are 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. 12 Two-bedroom homcs are eligible for one permit. Proof of ownership of two vehicles registered in
13 the name of someone listed on the lease is required to receive one permit. Three-bedroom homes
14 are eligible for two permits. Proof of ownership of three vehicles registered in the name of
15 someone listed on the lease is required to receive two permits. Each vehicle parked on-site must
16 'also conform to all applicable vehicle regulations. Vehicles parked on-site must be maintained in
17| operating condition.
18 33. Windridge retains a private company for parking enforcement and security. The
19| security and parking enforcement staff visit Windridge several times on a nightly basis, every day
20 of the week.
21 34. EQR requires all Windridge residents over the age of 18 to be listed on the lease for
22| each home. Windridge's occupancy standard is two residents (over the age of two) per
23 bedroom/den plus one additional person per apartment. Windridge staff regularly monitor
24| oceupancy during preventative maintenance walks and any other time there is a valid reason to be
25 in an occupied apartment. Subletting of apartments in Windridge is strictly prohibited, as are
26 short-term rentals and room-sharing arrangements.
27 35. Many residents of Windridge must routinely utilize the public streets surrounding
28 Windridge and in the vicinity of Windridge for on-street parking, including overnight parking. 8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE FOR VIOLATION OF VEHICLE CODE, LAGUNA NIGUEL MUNICIPAL CODE & CEQA, & COMPLAINT FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION & DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

The availability of on-street parking for Windridge residents is an important feature and
2 requirement for many Windridge residents. If on-street overflow parking is not available for
3 Windridge residents, EQR would not be able to lease apartments to many families, including
larger families and families with multiple drivers, which would substantially decrease the value of
5 the Windridge property.
City Permit Parking Ordinance and Districts

36. In 2007 the City adopted a municipal ordinance, now contained in the City's
8 Municipal Code at Section 7-4-607, which authorized and established proccdures for permit
9 parking distriets within the City.
10 37. Municipal Code Section 7-4-607 provides that "It]he city council may establish
11| residential permit parking programs in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section."
12 38. In order to approve and implement a permit parking district, the City Council must
13 find that "parking problems" in the proposed parking district "substantially interfere with the
14 normal and expected use of available public street parking spaces at regular daily or weekly
15 intervals." (Laguna Niguel Municipal Code § 7-4-607(a).)
16 39. Following adoption of Municipal Code Section 7-4-607, the City approved several
17 permit parking districts within various neighborhoods in the City, The prior districts did not have
18 an immediate or material impact on Windridge or its residents, based on the location and scope of
19 the districts.
20 40. On September 23, 2015, a neighborhood association in the City, the Somerset Point
21|| Homeowners Association ("Somerset HOA"), submitted a request to the City for establishment of
22| a permit parking district. The Somerset HOA includes 141 single-family homes "located west of
23 Golden Lantern and Hidden Hills Road," which are "primerily accessed from Hidden Hills Road."
24 Several apartment complexes, including Windridge, are located in the vicinity of the Somerset
25| HOA neighborhood.
26 41. On July 26, 2016, the City received a request from the Sterling Niguel
27 Homeowners Association ("Sterling HOA") for establishment of a permit parking district in its
28 neighborhood. The Sterling HOA "includes 115 homes located between Niguel Ranch Road and 9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE POR VIOLATION OF VEHICLE CODE, LAGUNA NIGUEL MUNICIPAL CODE &
CEQA, & COMPLAINT FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION & DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Carma Court, which can be accessed from Hidden Hills Road." The Sterling HOA neighborhood
2 is located directly across the street from Windridge, separated by Hidden Hills Road.
3 42. The City did not take any immediate action in response to the Somerset HOA and
Sterling HOA applications. Instead, in late 2016 the City took steps to develop a "Citywide
Residential Parking Permit Program" ("RPPP") with the stated intent "to develop more detailed
guidelines and procedures to address concerns for overflow parking from adjacent multi-
7 residential developments." (Somerset HOA Staff Report, April 3, 2018, p. 3.)
43. The City thereafter retained third party consultant to prepare a parking survey and
9 to draft a Citywide RPPP, The City's appointed Traffic Commission considered the RPPP in a
10 series of meetings Chroughout 2017. The City indicated that the Somerset HOA and Sterling HOA
11 permit parking district applications would be "put on hold" while the City considered the Citywide
12| RPPP.
13 44. Windridge submitted comments to the City regarding the RPPP in 2017. After the
14  City gave notice that it would consider an ordinance establishing the Citywide RPPP at the
15| September 19, 2017 City Council meeting, Windridge submitted detailed comments and
16 objections to the City's approval of the RPPP. Windridge objected to and opposed the approval of
17 the RPPP on a number of grounds, including that the City was required to, but had failed to,
18 subject the RPPP to a detailed and comprehensive level of CEQA review.
19 45. At its September 19, 2017 meeting, the City Council considered but did not
20 approve the Citywide R.PPP, based primarily on Windridge's objections, as well as questions and
21 concerns raised by other City residents and certain City Council members.
22 46. The City Council also indicated, at the September 19, 2017 meeting, that it would,
23 in the future, consider the previously submitted Somerset HOA and Sterling HOA permit parking
24| district applications.
25 47. On December 8, 2017, the City released an agenda for the December 14, 2017
26| regular meeting of the City's Traffic Commission, which indicated that the Traffic Commission
27 would consider the Somerset HOA and Sterling HOA permit parking applications at that meeting.

CEQA, & COMPLAINT FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION & DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEG

The Traffic Commission does not have authority to approve permit parking programs, but can

2 make recommendations to the City Council.

3 48. In the staff report that accompanied the agenda for the Traffic Commission
meeting, City staff recommended that the Traffic Commission "table," or delay, consideration of
the Sterling HOA permit parking district application "to a future date when the Traffic
Commission reviews parking permit applications from Windridge Apartments and Vista Mar
7 HOA and consider action on the three requests at the same time since those applications are
8 linked." City staff did recommend approval of the Somerset HOA permit parking district
9 application.
10 49. Counsel for Windridge submitted detailed comments to the City's Traffic
11 Commission prior to the December 14, 2017 meeting regarding the Somerset HOA and Sterling
12| HOA permit parking district applications. Windridge requested that the City again delay
13 consideration of the permit parking district applications at least until the City could consider other
14| *linked" permit parking district applications, including applications which would extend permit
15 parking district rights to Windridge residents. Windridge also again pointed out that the City was
16| required to, but had failed to, undertake any CEQA review of the pending permit parking district
17 applications.
18 50. The City's Traffic Commission thereafter delayed consideration of the Somerset
19 HOA and Sterling HOA permit parking district applications to give City staff time to review and
20 respond to Windridge's comments.
21 51. On February 28, 2018, the City's Traffic Commission considered and
22 recommended that the City Council approve the Somerset HOA and Sterling HOA permit parking
23| district applications. The applications were thereafter placed on the agenda for consideration by
24 the City Council at its regular April 3, 2018 meeting. The City did not give notice of a hearing for
25 the two new permit parking districis, but instead placed consideration of the districts on the City
26 Council's Consent Calendar. The City also only gave notice of its consideration and possible
27 approval of the permit parking district applications on March 30, 2018, just four days before the
28 City Council mecting. 11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE FOR VIOLATION OP VEHICLE CODE, LAGUNA NIGUEL MUNICIPAL CODE &
CEQA, & COMPLAINT FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION & DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

52. Prior to the April 3, 2018 City Council meeting, Windridge again submitted
detailed comments requesting that the City reject the Somerset HOA and Sterling HOA permit
3 parking district applications based on the City's failure to subject the applications to any CEQA
review, as well as the City's failure to comply with applicable provisions of the Vehicle Code and
the City's Municipal Code. Windridge also pointed out that the proposed districts improperly
6 discriminated against Windridge residents and other apartment residents within the City,
53, At its April 3, 2018 mecting, the City Council rejected Windridge's comments and
8 adopted and approved separate resolutions establishing new permit parking districts in the
9 Somerset HOA and Sterling HOA neighborhoods, The City did not undertake any level of CEQA
10| review prior to its approval of the permit parking districts.
11 54. The separate resolutions for the Somerset HOA and Sterling HOA permit parking
12| districts do not indicate that the City approved the parking districts based on a lack of available
13 street parking in the neighborhoods. Instead, the resolutions expressly state that the City approved
14 the districts based on "concerns about overflow parking from the multi-residential development on
15 Hidden Hills Road." That is clearly a reference to Windridge, and to parking by residents of
16 Windridge on public streets outside of Windridge.
17 55. The City approved the permit parking districts for improper and illegal reasons, and
18 for reasons unrelated to a lack of available street parking within the new districts. Instead, the
19| City reported that Sterling HOA residents requested a permit parking district due to concerns over
20 "trash in and around the community," the presence of "park and ride shuttles, in the
21 neighborhood," and "diminished property valucs.» The staff report for the Somerset HOA further
22 indicates that homeowners in that neighborhood requested approval of e permit parking district not
23 to address parking problems, but duc to concerns over "litter" and "parked vehicles in states of
24| disrepair."
25 56. During the course of public comments on the proposed districts at the City Council
26| meeting and previous Traffic Commission meetings, a number of residents of various
27| neighborhoods made hostile, discriminatory aud disparaging remarks about Windridge's
28 predominately Hispanic residents. Public commenters referred, for example, to Windridge 12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE FOR VIOLATION OF VEHICLE CODE, LAGUNA NIGUEL MUNICIPAL CODE & CEQA, & COMPLAINT FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION & DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Residents as "those people," and generally claimed that Windridge residents wore not entitled to
2 the same rights and privileges as other residents of the City.
57. The staff reports and other information considered by the City prior to and at the
April 3, 2018 City Council meeting did not establish or indicate that there was a lack of available
parking spaces in the Somerset HOA and Sterling HOA neighborhoods. Instead, the staff reports
and traffic studies indicated that parking spots were available each night in the neighborhoods, and
that on many occasions only a small percentage of available parking spots were filled.
58. A number of people still commented at the Traffic Commission and City Council
9 meetings that residents of apartments, and in particular residents of Windridge, should not be
10 allowed to park in their neighborhoods, or on any public streets in the City. Public commenters at
11 the meetings did not reference a lack of parking in their neighborhioods as a justification for permit 12| parking districts, but stated that a parking ban was necessary to address "litter," "noise," and 13| "crime," which conditions were attributed to or blamed on Windridge residents, without any
14| evidence or explanation.
15 Additional Proposed Parking Restrictions
16 59. At its April 25, 2018 meeting, the City's Traffic Commission recommended a ban
17 on overnight parking ou several streets immediately adjacent to Windridge, including Hidden
18 Hills, Niguel Ranch, Carmen and Spalding streets, without consideration of or recommendation
19| for a permit parking district for that area. The City Council has not yet considered or taken action
20 on the Traffic Commission's recommendation to ban overnight parking on those streets.
21 60. The City has posted signs for the implementation of the new Somerset HOA and
22| Sterling HOA permit parking districts in the neighborhoods near Windridge, and will apparently
23 implement the permit parking districts in May or June, 2018, thus threatening significant harm and
24 prejudice to Windridge and its residents.
25 61. The implementation of the Somerset HOA and Sterling HOA permit parking
26 districts would substantially reduce the number of on-street public parking spots available to
27| residents of the City. Residents of other apartment complexes and condominiums in the vicinity
28 of Windridge would not be able to utilize available on-street public parking near their residences, 13
VERIFIED PETTION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE POR VIOLATION OF VEHICLE CODE, LÁGUNA NIGUEL MUNICIPAL CODE & CEQA, & COMPLAINT FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION & DECLARATOR Y & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

which would force residents of the City to compete for a shrinking number of available parking
2 spots. Residents of Windridge would also be forced to park far from their homes, and walk
3| considerable distances to their homes. Available parking for residents of the City would be
squeezed and reduced to a smaller and smaller area, in more remote portions of the City, to the
point of oversaturation, and to the point where the increasing pressure for parking would reach the
6 breaking point, rendering it impossible for many City residents to park in their own
7| neighborhoods, and near their own homes.
8 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
9 (Writ of Mandate- C.C.P. 9§ 1085 and 1094.5) (Violation of Vehicle Code Section 22507-Improper Approval of 10 Permit Parking Distriets)
11 62. BQR realleges and incorporates, as though fully set forth herein, cach and every
12| allogation in paragraphs 1 through 61 of this Petition and Complaint.

13 63. Pursuant to Vehicle Code Section 22507, cities may, by ordinance or resolution,
14 designate "certain streets upon which preferential parking privileges are given to residents and
15 merchants adjacent to the streets for their use and the use of their guests, under which the residents
16 and merchants may be issued a permit or permits that exempt them from the prohibition or
17 restriction of the ordinance or resolution." Section 22507 further provides that "[a] local
18 ordinance or resolution adopted pursuant to this section may contain provisions that are reasonable
19| and necessary to ensure the effectiveness of a preferential parking program."
20 64. California courts have held that, pursuant to Vehicle Code Section 22507, cities
21 may impose permit parking programs and limitations that differentiate between residents and non-
22 residents, such as commuters. (See Friedman v, City of Beverly Hills (1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 436.)
23 "The purpose of section 22507 is to turn over parking regulations to local government. The statute
24| expressly gives local authorities the power to prohibit or restrict parking, and to adopt provisions
25 in preferential parking programs which are reasonable and necessary to ensure that they are
26 effective." (Id., at 444.)

27 65. California courts, and the Vehicle Code, however, prohibit permit parking
28 programs and parking restrictions that distinguish between or discriminate against residents of
14
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE FOR VIOLATION OF VEHICLE CODE, LAGUNA NIGUEL MUNICIPAL CODE & CEQA, & COMPLAINT FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION & DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

apartments or other multi-family residences. Vehiele Code Section 22507 does not authorize
2 establishment of permit parking districts based entirely on a desire to exclude and bar residents of
3 nearby or adjoining neighborhoods from parking in a particular neighborhood, where there is
otherwise no shortage of available parking spaces.
5 66. In a recent Opinion, the Attorney General of the State of California confirmed that
pursuant to Vehicle Code Section 22507, when establishing permit parking districts or issuing
7 residential parking permits, local authorities cannot "distinguish among residents based on the
8 type of dwelling in which they live-for example, by only making permits available to those who
reside in single-family dwellings or small (two-to-four-unit) multifamily dwellings, and excluding
10 those who reside in larger multifamily dwelling units such as apartment buildings." (99
11| Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 49 (2016).)
12 67. In the Opinion, the Attorney General explained that the State has primary authority
13 over the regulation of streets and parking on public streets: "The streets of a city belong to the
14 people of the state, and every citizen of the state has right to the use thereof, subject to legislative IS control. The right of control over street traffic is an exercise of part of the sovereign power of the
16 state. Local ordinances regulating traffic which are inconsistent with general state laws are
17 invalid. While it is true it that the regulation of traffic upon a public street is of special interest to the
18 people of a municipality, it does not follow that such regulation is a municipal affair, and if there
19 is a doubt as to whether or not such regulation is a municipal affair, that doubt must be resolved in
20 favor of the legislative authority of the state." (Id, quoting Ex. Parte Daniels (1920) 183 Cal. 636,
21 639, emphasis added.)
22 68. The Attorney General recognized that under Vehicle Code Section 22507, local
23 authorities may "issue long-term preferential parking permits to residents only." (Id.) The
24 Attorney Gencral further stated: "Having concluded that Vehicle Code section 22507 allows local
25 authorities to limit preferential parking to residents only, we next consider whether, in issuing
26 residential parking permits, local authorities may further distinguish among residents based on the
27 typc of dwelling in which they live--for example, by making permits avuilable only to those
28| residents who occupy single-family dwellings or small (two-to-four-unit) multifamily dwellings. 15
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE FOR VIOLATION OF VEHICLE CODE, LAGUNA NIGUEL MUNICIPAL CODE & CEQA, & COMPLAINT FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION & DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

We conclude that local authorities may not do so." (Id.)
69.

W The Attorney General explained that given the broad definition of "resident" in
Vehicle Code Section 22507, "the Legislature did not intend to give local authorities discretion to
treat certain, or particular, residents differently from other residents in this context." (Id.) The
Attorney General further concluded "that Vehicle Code section 22507 docs not authorize local

co authorities, in issuing long-term residential parking permits, to distinguish among residents based
on the type of dwelling in which they live." (ld.)
70. The resolutions approving the Somerset HOA and Sterling HOA permit parking
9 districts violate Vehicle Code Section 22507 and the Attorney General's Opinion because they
10| expressly state that the City approved the districts for the sole purpose of barring residents of
11

12 Windridge from parking in the referenced neighborhoods. Specifically, the resolutions are void
and invalid on their face, as a matter of law, because they expressly state that they are intended to
13 exclude and bar certain City residents from parking in the districts based entirely on the fact that
14 they live in a "multi-residential development." 1S 71.
16 The materials and reports presented to the City Council additionally did not
demonstrate that there was a shortage of available parking spaces in the Somerset HOA or Sterling
17 HOA neighborhoods. The permit parking districts are not "reasonable and necessary to ensure the
18 effectiveness of a preferential parking program," since imposition of parking restrictions that
19 excluded apartment residents was not "reasonable," and absent a shortage of parking spaces, the
20| parking restrictions adopted by the City are not "necessary." (Vehicle Code § 22507.)
21 72. The City's approval of the Somerset HOA and Sterling HOA permit parking
22 districts therefore violated California law, and specifically Vehicle Code Section 22507, because
23 the City improperly (I) denied parking rights and permits to residents of the City that reside in
24 Windridge or other apartment complexes, (2) discriminated and distinguished between residents of
25 single family homes and apartments, and (3) imposed unreasonable and unnecessary parking
26 restrictions.
27 73. The City's actions in approving the permit parking districts are in express
28| derogation of its statutory duties, and the City failed to proceed in a manner a required by law. Such 16
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE FOR VIOLATION OF VEHICLE CODE, LAGUNA NIGUEL MUNICIPAL CODE & CEQA, & COMPLAINT FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION & DECLARATOR Y & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

actions and inactions also constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion on the part of the City and
2 the City Council because they (1) are not supported by adequate findings or law, (2) are not
supported by substantial evidence, and (3) are contrary to and in direct violation of California law,
and in particular Vehiole Code Section 22507.

5 74. EQR has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law,
6 other than the relief sought in this Petition and Complaint. EQR is therefore entitled to a writ of
mandate enjoining and ordering the City to set aside its approval of the Somerset HOA and
8 Sterling HOA permit parking districts.
9 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
10 (Writ of Mandate--C.C.P. $§ 1085 and 1094.5) (Violation of Vehicle Code Section 22507.5- Failure to Give Proper Notice of Consideration 11 of Permit Parking Restrictions)
12 75. EQR. realleges and incorporates, as though fully set forth herein, each and every
13| allegation in paragraphs 1 through 74 of this Petition and Complaint.

14 76. Pursuant to Vehicle Code Section 22507.5(c), a city or local agency may not
15| impose overnight parking restrictions unless and until the city or local agency "holds a public
16 hearing on the proposed ordinance prior to its adoption, with notice of the public hearing given in
17 accordance with Section 65090 of the Government Code." Government Code Section 65090
18 provides that "notice shall be published pursuant to Section 6061 in at least one newspaper of
19 general circulation within the jurisdiction of the local agency which is conducting the proceeding
20 at least 10 days prior to the hearing, or if there is no such newspaper of general circulation, the
21 notice shall be posted at least 10 days prior to the hearing in at least three public places within the
22 jurisdiction of the local agency."

23 77. Instead of giving at least ten-days' notice of its consideration and possible approval
24| of the permit parking distriets, the City provided notice by publication of its agenda for the April
25 3, 2018 City Council meeting on March 30, 2018, only four days prior to the City Council
26 meeting. The City also failed to provide any notice of its consideration of the permit parking
27| districts in a newspaper of general circulation.

28
17
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE FOR VIOLATION OF VEHICLE CODE, LAGUNA NIGUEL MUNICIPAL CODE &
CEQA, & COMPLAINT FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION & DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIET

78. In the agenda for the April 3, 2018 City Council meeting, the City indicated that it
2 would consider approval of the permit parking districts not during a hearing, but on the City's
3 consent calendar. The City Council took the permit parking district applications off the consent
calendar during the meeting and had a discussion regarding the proposed distriets, based on public
5 comments regarding the districts. However, the City still did not hold a hearing on the proposed
6 districts, nor did the City provide any notice of a hearing,
79, The City therefore violated Vehicle Code Section 22507.5 by failing to hold
8| hearing on the proposed permit parking districts, and by failing to give at least ten-days' notice of
9 its intended approval of the permit parking districts.
10 80. The City's actions in approving the permit parking districts are in express
11  derogation of its statutory duties, and the City failed to proceed in a manner required by law, as the
12 City did not give proper or timely notice of the potential approval of the permit parking districts,
13 nor did the City hold a hearing prior to approval of the districts, The actions of the City were
14 therefore contrary to and in direct violation of California law, and in particular Vehicle Code
15 Sections 22507 and 22507.5.
16 81. EQR has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law,
17| other than the relief sought in this Petition and Complaint. EQR is therefore entitled to a writ of
18 mandate enjoining and ordering the City to set aside its approval of the Somerset HOA and
19 Sterling HOA permit parking distriets.
20 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
21 (Writ of Mandate-C.C.P. §§ 1085 and 1094.5) (Violation of Municipal Code-Improper Approval of Permit Parking Districts) 22

23 82. EQR realleges and incorporates, as though fully sct forth herein, each and every

24 allegation in paragraphs 1 through 81 of this Petition and Complaint.

25 83. Laguna Niguel Municipal Code Section 7-4-607(a) states "The purpose of the city
26 residential permit parking programs is to regulate and manage residential eurb parking problems.
27 The parking problems must substantially interfere with the normal and expected use of available

28 public strect parking spaces at regular daily or weekly intervals."
18
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE FOR VIOLATION OF VEHICLE CODE, LAGUNA NIGUEL MUNICIPAL CODE & CEQA, & COMPLAINT FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION & DECLARATOR Y & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

84. The documents and materials considered by the City do not indicate that there were
2 parking problems in the neighborhoods requesting the permit parking districts that substantially
3 interfered with the normal and expected use of public street parking spaces, The evidence and
materials presented to the City instead demonstrate that parking spots were regularly available
each night in the Somerset HOA and Sterling HOA neighborhoods.
85. The staff report for the Somerset HOA permit parking district, for example, states
that "the total overnight street parking capacity of all streets within the Somerset Point HOA is
8 275 vehicles," and that "nighttime surveys indicated an average of 75 total vehicles parked" in that
9 neighborhood at night. A parking survey attached to the staff report further indicates that there are
10 consistently up to 200 parking spots available every night in the Somerset HOA neighborhood.
11 86. The staff report for the Sterling HOA permit parking district indicates that the
12| "total strect parking capacity of all the streets within the Sterling Niguel HOA coinmunity is 115
13 vehicles." The staff report further states that at most 100 cars have been observed parked on the
14| street in that neighborhood. That statement, and the acknowledgement of up to 15 available
15 parking spaces on the street, confirms that there is not and has not been any "substantial
16 interference" with the normal and expected use of available public street parking spaces in that
17 neighborhood.
18 87. The identified areas of concern for the Somerset HOA and Sterling HOA
19 neighborhoods (vehicles parked for extended periods of time, litter, vehicles in states of disrepair)
20 do not support or justify establishment of permit parking districts. The Municipal Code does not
21 identify litter, vehicles in states of disrepair or vebicles parked for extended periods of time as

22| valid justifications for formation and approval of a permit parking district.
23 88. The City therefore did not comply with its own Municipal Code in connection with
24| the permit parking districts, In violation of Municipal Code Section 7-4-607, the evidence
25 considered by the City prior to approval of the permit parking districts does not establish or
26 indicate that "parking problems" in the Somerset HOA and Sterling HOA neighborhoods
27| "substantially interfered with the normal and expected use of available public street parking spaces
28 at regular daily or weekly intervals." 19
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE FOR VIOLATION OF VEHICLE CODE, LAGUNA NIGUEL MUNICIPAL CODE &
CEQA, & COMPLAINT FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION & DECLARATORY & INIUNCTIVE RELIEF

89. The staff reports for the Somersel HOA and Sterling HOA permit parking districts
instead concluded that, notwithstanding the consistent availability of parking spots in those
3 neighborhood, because there are vehicles parking within the Somerset HOA and Sterling HOA
neighborhoods which are not registered to any property within the neighborhoods, "there is a need
for a permit parking district."

90. The presence of parked vehicles not registered to any property within an area of the
City, however, is not a justification for a permit parking district, where there is otherwise no
8 substantial interference with or lack of available parking. The Municipal Code does not identify
9 the presence of "non-resident" parked cars in a neighborhood as a justification or basis for
10 approval of a permit parking district. The Municipal Code does not require City residents to only
11 park within their own neighborhood or within a certain distance from their homes. The Municipal
12| Code additionally does not prohibit City residents from parking their cars in adjacent
13 neighborhoods, nor does the Municipal Code indicate that such actions would justify or require
14 approval of a permit parking district.
15 91. Municipal Code Section 7-4-607 further provides: "The resolution specified in
16 subsection (c) of this section may provide that parking restrictions imposed pursuant to this
17 section shall apply to the designated permit parking area only after a petition signed by the owners
18 of 67 percent or more of the residential lots abutting the on street parking spaces of the subject
19 restrictions have filed a petition with the traffic commission expressing their desire for such
20 parking restrictions." (Laguna Niguel Municipal Code § 7-4-607(d).)
21 92. There is no indication in the staff reports or in the materials presented to the City
22 Council that the Somerset HOA and Sterling HOA permit parking district applications, or
23 petitions, were signed by "67 percent or more of the residential lots abutting the on-street parking
24 spaces of the subject restrictions," as required by Laguna Niguel Municipal Code Section 7-4-
25 607(d). Although staff provided the City Council with copies of the petitions requesting formation
26| of the Somerset HOA and Sterling HOA permit parking districts, there is no indication or
27| evidence that 67 percent or more of the residents. in homes abutting the on-street parking spaces
28
20
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE FOR VIOLATION OF VEHICLE CODE, LAGUNA NIGUEL MUNICIPAL CODE &
CEQA, & COMPLAINT FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION & DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIÉEF

that would be subject to parking restrictions signed, supported or approved the applications for the
2 permit parking districts.
3 93. The City's actions in approving the permit parking districts are in express
derogation of' its statutory duties, and the City failed to proceed in a manner required by law, Such
5 actions and inactions also constitute prejudicial abuse of discretion on the part of these elected
officials because they (1) are not supported by adequate findings or law, (2) are not supported by
substantial evidence, and (3) are contrary to and in direct violation of California law, and in
8 particular Laguna Niguel Municipal Code Sections 7-4-607(a) and (d),
94. EQR has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law,
10 other than the relief sought in this Petition and Complaint. EQR is therefore entitled to a writ of
11| mandate enjoining and ordering the City to sel aside its approval of the Somerset HOA and
12 Sterling HOA permit parking districts.
13 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
14 (Writ of Mandate-C.C.P. $9 1085 and 1094.5) (Violation of CEQA - Improper Relianee on Inapplicable Categorical Exemption) 15

16 95. EQR realleges and incorporates, as though fully set forth herein, each and every

17 allogation in paragraphs through 94 of this Petition and Complaint.

18 96. The City violated CEQA by failing to conduct any environmental analysis of its
19 approval of the Somerset HOA and Sterling HOA permit parking districts, and by attempting to
20 rely on inapplicable categorical exemptions for the approval of the new permit parking districts,
21| including the "categorical" exemptions contained in CEQA Guidelines Sections 15061(b)(3) and

22 15301. (14 Cal. Code Regs §§ 15061, 15301.)

23 97. The City's approval of the permit parking districts is subject to CEQA because the

24 approval constitutes a "Project" pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 21065. CEQA defines

25 a "Project" as "an activity which may cause either a direct physical change in the environment, or
26 a reasonably foresecable indirect physical change in the environment, and which is any of the
27 following: (a) An activity directly undertaken by any public agency, . " (Public Resources Code

28 21065.)

21
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE FOR VIOLATION OF VEHICLE CODE, LACUNA NIGUEL MUNICIPAL CODE & CEQA, & COMPLAINT FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION & DECLAKATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEP

98. Categorical exemptions under CEQA are rebuttable, Reliance on categorical
exemptions are disallowed if there is a single, low-threshold "fair argument" that a project may
3| have significant environmental impacts. (14 Cal. Code Regs $15300.2.)
99. Courts have traditionally narrowly construed categorical exemptions (Dehne V.
County of Santa Clara (1981) 115 Cal.App.3d 827, 842), and the scope of exemptions should not
be unreasonably expanded. (Wildlife Alive v. Chickering (1976) 18 Cal.3d 190, 205.) Strict
construction ensures that categorical exemptions are interpreted a in a manner affording the greatest
8 environmental protection within the reasonable scope of their statutory language. (County of
9| Amador v. El Dorado County Water Agency (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 966.)
10 100. The Section 15301 cxemption, morcover, states that the exemption only applies to
11| permitting or licensing activities that involve "negligible or no expansion of existing use beyond
12| that existing at the time of the lead agency's determination." The two new districts will
13 significantly modify and expand the City's permit parking program to cover new, additional areas 14 of the City, in excess of the current scope of the parking program.
15 101. The Section 15301 exemption additionally does not apply because it is a certainty
16 that the districts will have a significant impact on the environment. It is improper to rely on a
17 categorical exemption "where there is any reasonable possibility that a project or activity may
18 have a significant effect on the environment." (Wildlife Alive v. Chickering, 18 Cal.3d at 205-206;
19 14 Cal Code Regs. § 15300.2(c).) The districts would result in significant impacts on the
20 environment by causing a shift and significant increase in residential parking and the use of
21| existing facilities in arcas outside of the districts. The districts will also result in the increased use
22 of streets and roads in and around the City As a result of residents being forced to drive around
23| looking for parking, and being forced to park in areas far removed from their homes.
24 102. The findings in the staff reports do not justify the City's failure to comply with
25 CEQA in connection with the permit parking districts. Establishment of permit parking districts
26 for the Somerset HOA and Sterling HOA neighborhoods will substantially increase parking
27 impacts, issues and limitations in other neighborhoods, and will result in significant adverse 28| impacts in surrounding neighborhoods. 22
VERIFIED PETTTION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE FOR VIOLATION OF VEHICLE CODE, LAGUNA NIGUEL MUNICIPAL CODE & CEQA, & COMPLAINT FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION & DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

103. EQR and Windridge residents and staff have indicated to the City on numerous
occasions that adopting piecemeal, separate parking districts within the City will increase the
3 demand for parking in other parts of the City, will unfairly and improperly prevent City residents
from parking within their own neighborhoods, and will unreasonably decrease the number of
5 parking spots available to City residents outside of the parking districts. All of those impacts will
have a significant adverse effect on City residents and the environment. Such impacts include
impacts caused by the City forcing many residents to park far from their homes, thereby increasing
8 risks to their health and safety, increasing parking problems in other City neighborhoods, and
9 increasing traffic and congestion in parts of the City outside of the proposed districts.
10 104. The parking districts would essentially shift a substantial number of cars ouf of the
11| portions of the City covered by the districts, to other undetermined locations. The districts 12| constitute a significant land use and planning action by the City, with resulting significant impacts
13 on the City, its residents, and the environment.
14 105. A project that causes a change, aud in particular an increase, in traffic and parking
15 movement and patterns necessarily will have a significant impact on the environment, thus
16| requiring preparation of an RIR. (Gentry v. City of Murrieta (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 1359, 1414-
17 15.) The environmental checklist form recommended for use in an initial study to consider the
18 proper level of CEQA review (Appendix G to CEQA Guidelines) asks a lead agency to consider
19 whether project will "[r]esult in inadequate parking capacity," and also whether the project will
20 "[c]ause an increase in traffic which is substantial in relation to the existing traffic load and
21 capacity of the street system (i.e., result in a substantial increase in either the number of vehicle
22 trips, the volume to capacity ratio on roads, or congestion at intersections)."
23 106. The City's failure to subject the two permit parking districts to CEQA review
24| presents far more than a technical violation of the law. The lack of CEQA review prevented and
25| limited public knowledge of and participation in the process for the consideration and approval of
26| the parking districts. Without CEQA review, the public was not given a proper opportunity to
27| comment on the proposed districts in advance of the City's consideration of the districts. Without
28 CEQA review, the City did not consider mitigation measures or reasonable alternatives to the 23
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE FOR VIOLATIÓN OF VEHICLE CODE, LAOUNA NIGUEL MUNICIPAL CODE & CEQA, & COMPLAINT FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION & DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RÉLIEP

parking districts. The City additionally did not give notice of the proposed districts to surrounding

2 communities, the State, the County, transportation agencies, or other individuals and entities that

3 will be significantly impacted and prejudiced by the approval and creation of new parking

4 districts.

107. The actions of the City in attempting to rely on the inapplicable exemptions to
avoid CEQA review for its approval of the permit parking districts constitute a prejudicial abuse
of discretion because the City failed to proceed in a manner required by law, its actions are not
8 supported by adequate findings, and its actions and findings are not supported by substantial
evidence.

10 108. EQR has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law,
11 other than the relief sought in this Petition and Complaint. EQR is therefore entitled to a writ of
12| mandate enjoining and ordering the City to set aside its approval of the Somorset HOA and
13| Sterling HOA permit parking districts.

161

17 109. EQR realleges and incorporates, as though fully set forth herein, cach and every
18| allegation in paragraphs 1 through 108 of this Petition and Complaint.

19 110. The City's actions.in approving the Somerset HOA and Sterling HOA permit
20 parking districts constitutet prejudicial abuse of discretion in that the City failed to identify and

21 assess the potential impacts on the environment arising from approval and implementation of the

22 permit parking districts, including secondary and cumulative impacts. The City failed to satisfy

23 the requirements of CEQA and improperly approved the permit parking districts despite

24 significant adverse environmental offects arising from and caused by such approvals.

25 111. During the course of prior meetings, including several Traffic Commission

26 meetings, City officials acknowledged that the approval of separate permit parking districts would
have significant impacts on the environment and on parking and traffic within the City. 27| likely
28 City officials also indicated that the City should still approve the new permit parking distriets so
24

CEQA, & COMPLAINT FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION & DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

that the City could "see what happens" with the permit parking districts, and determine the actual
2 impacts after the approval and implementation of the districts. That, of course, is directly contrary
3 to the intent and requirements of CEQA, and is a clear violation of CEQA.
112. The actions of the City in failing to analyze the environmental impacts of the
approval of the permit parking districts constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion because the
City a failed to proceed in a manner required by law, its actions are not supported by adequate
findings, and its actions and findings are not supported by substantial evidence.
8 113. EQR has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law,
9 other than the relief sought in this Petition and Complaint. FQR is therefore entitled to a writ of
10| mandate enjoining and ordering the City to set aside its approval of the Somerset HOA and
11 Sterling HOA permit parking districts.
12 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION
13 (Writ of Mandate---C.C.P. $§ 1085 and 1094.5) (Violation of CEQA -Iproper "Piecemcaling" of Project to Avoid CEQA Review)
14 114. EQR realleges and incorporates, as though fully set forth herein, each and every
15| allegation in paragrapbs 1 through 113 of this Petition and Complaint.
16 115. Windridge previously objected to the City's consideration of a proposed Citywide
17 Residential Permit Parking Program (RPPP) based, in part, on the City's failure to conduct any
18 type of CEQA review of the RPPP. The City responded to and attempted to avoid Windridge's
19 objections by "chopping" the proposed RPPP into smaller separate neighborhood permit parking
20 districts, to attempt to avoid CEQA review of the impact of a comprehensive Citywide parking
21| program, and an expansion of the number and scope of permit parking distriets in the City,
22 116. A public entity, however, cannot avoid compliance with CEQA by "piecemcaling,"
23 or segmenting, a project into smaller, separate components. (Orinda Association v. Board of
24 Supervisors (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 1145, 1171.) The City specifically cannot avoid proper,
25 comprehensive CEQA review by chopping its overall effort to address parking issues in the City
26 into smaller, separate and allegedly isolated projects involving the establishment of parking
27| districts in separate parts of the City.
28
25
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE FOR VIOLATION OF VEHICLE CODE, LAGUNA NIGUEL MUNICIPAL CODE & CEQA, & COMPLAINT FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION & DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

117. CEQA defines "Project" broadly to encompass "the whole of an action, which has
a potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably
foresceable indirect physical change in the environment." (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15378.) That
definition is intended to preclude "piecemeal review which results from 'chopping large project
into many little ones--each with a minimal potential impact on the environment---which
6 cumulatively may have disastrous consequences."" (Planning & Conservation League v. Castaic
7 Lake Water Agency (2009) 180 Cal.App,4th 210, 235.)
8 118. The City cannot avoid CEQA review by ignoting impacts, including cumulative
9. and secondary impacts, arising from and associated with the separate, piecemeal approval of a
101 series of separate parking districts within adjacent neighborhoods. The staff reports for the
11 Sterling HOA and Somerset HOA parking districts, for example, should have but failed to
12| consider potential impacts associated with the approval of separate, additional parking districts.
13 The staff reports fail to even mention impacts associated with other current or proposed parking
14 districts, and the resulting impacts from the approval of the Sterling HOA and Somerset HOA
15 districts.

16 119. Restricting and reducing parking in certain neighborhoods, and reducing the
17 number of available parking spots in the City, will only exacerbate, rather than relieve, any actual
18 or perceived parking issues, and will increase the significant and adverso impacts associated with
19 the parking restrictions and reductions. Establishing permit parking districts in the Somerset HOA
20 and Sterling HOA neighborhoods, for example, will increase parking issues and limitations in
21 other neighborhoods, and will result in significant adverse impacts in surrounding neighborhoods.
22 120. The actions of the City in altempting to avoid proper, comprehensive CEQA review
23| of permit parking districts by chopping its overall effort to address parking issues in the City into
24 smaller, separate and allegedly isolated projects, in violation of CEQA, constitute a prejudicial
25 abuse of discretion because the City failed to proceed in a manner required by law, its actions are
26 not supported by adequate findings, and its actions and findings are not supported by substantial
27| evidence.

121. EQR has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law,
other than the relief sought in this Petition and Complaint. EQR is therefore entitled to a writ of
mandate enjoining and ordering the City lo set aside its approval of the Somerset HOA and
Sterling HOA permit parking districts.
SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

6 (Writ of Mandate-C.C.P. §§ 1085 and 1094.5) (Violation of General Plan)
122. EQR realleges and incorporates, as though fully set forth herein, each and every
8 allegation in paragraphs 1 through 121 of this Petition and Complaint.
123. All public agencies, including the City, have a mandatory duty to refuse to approve
10 any project inconsistent with the General Plan of the city or county in which the project is located.
11 124. The permit parking districts, and the City's improper discriminatory treatment of
12 residents of apartments and multi-family developments, including Windridge, in connection with
13 the parking districts violates and is contrary to the City's General Plan. Among other things,
14 approval of the permit parking districts violated the Circulation Element of the City's General
15 Plan, which requires the City to provide sufficient on- and off-street parking for City residents.
16 (Seo Circulation Element Policy 7.1.)
17 125. The permit parking districts also violate the Housing Element of the General Plan,
18 including Goal 2, which requires the City to "maintain[] equal housing opportunities for all
19 residents in Laguna Niguel," and Policy 2.3, which calls for the City to "[e]nsure that City land
20 use and housing policies and regulations do not create unreasonable barriers to housing and
21| housing support services to special needs population groups such as. .. families with children."
22 126. The City's actions in approving the permit parking districts are in express
23 derogation of its statutory dutics, and the City failed to proceed in a manner required by law. Such
24 actions and inactions also constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion on the part of these elected
25 officials because they (1) are not supported by adequate findings or law, (2) are not supported by
26| substantial evidence, and (3) are contrary to and in direct violation of the City's General Plan.
27 127. FQR has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law,
28| other than the relief sought in this Petition and Complaint. BQR is therefore entitled to a writ of 27

Sterling HOA permit parking districts.
3 EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION

4 (Writ of Mandate--C.C.P. §§ 1085 and 1094.5)

u 128. (Inverse Condemnation)
EQR realleges and incorporates, as though fully set forth herein, cach and every
allegation in paragraphs through 127 of this Petition and Complaint.
129.

8 The City's approval of the Somerset HOA and Sterling HOA permit parking
districts caused and constituted a substantial impairment of access to and the use of BQR's
property, and substantially reduced and will reduce the value of EQR's property, in violation of
10 the rule of the California Constitution, Art I, Sec. 19, that private property may not be taken Of'
11 damaged for a public use without just compensation.

12 130. The City's approval of the Somerset HOA and Sterling HOA permit parking
13 districts also substantially impaired BQR's right to lease or rent its property to a tenant of its
14 choice by depriving such tenants of their right to park on City streets.

15 131. The City's approval of the Somerset HOA and Sterling HOA permit parking
16 districts served no legitimate public purpose because it had no effect other than to take away
17. EQR's right to transfer, sell or lease its property to tenants of its choice, and as a result the City
18 confiscated a valuable property right in violation of the California Constitution, Art I, Sec. 19.

19 132. The substantial impairment of access to and the use of and the right to lease EQR's
20| property has reduced and will reduce the value of EQR's property in the City in an amount to be

21 determined at trial.

22 133. The City has not compensated EQR for the substantial impairment of access to and
23 the use of EQR's property, or for the reduction in the value of EQR's property,

24 134. EQR additionally has incurred and will incur attorneys', appraisal, and engineering
25 fees because of this proceeding, in amounts that cannot yet be ascertained, which
26 in this action under the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure Section 1036, are recoverable

NINTH CAUSE OF ACTION
2 (Declaratory Relief)

3 135. EQR realleges and incorporates, as though fully set forth herein, cach and every
allegation in paragraphs 1 through 134 of this Petition and Complaint.
136. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between EQR, on the one hand,
and the City, on the other hand, concerning the City's compliance with Vehicle Code Sections
22507 and 22507.5, Laguna Niguel Municipal Code Section 7-4-607, CEQA, and the City's

8 General Plan.

137, EQR contends that the City violated Vehicle Code Sections 22507 and 22507.5

10 because it improperly discriminated against residents of Windridge, and other apartment

11 complexes, in approving permit parking districts which exeluded Windridge residents from the

12 benefits of the districts, that the permit parking districts are not reasonable and necessary, and

13 because the City failed to give sufficient notice or hold a hearing regarding the permit parking

14 districts. EQR further contends that the City violated Laguna Niguel Municipal Code Section 7-4-

15 607 because the record does not indicate that there were parking problems in the neighborhoods

16 requesting the permit parking districts that substantially interfered with the normal and expected

17 use of public street parking spaces. BQR also contends that the City violated and failed to comply

18 with CEQA by relying on inapplicable exemptions, failing to reyiew and consider the actual

19 impacts of the permit parking districts, and by aftempting to "chop up" a large permit parking

20 program into smaller segments in an attempt to avoid CBQA review. EQR additionally contends

21 that the City violated its General Plan in its approval of the permit parking districts. EQR is

22 informed and believes that the City contends otherwise.

23 138. Accordingly, a judicial resolution of this controversy and a declaration of the rights

24 of the parties herein with regard to the City's authority and ability to approve the Somerset HOA

25 and Sterling HOA permit parking districts, the City's compliance with the Vchicle Code, the

26 Municipal Code, CEQA, and the City's General Plan, ate necessary and appropriate in accordance

27 with Code of Civil Procedure Section 1060.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE FOR VIOLATION OF VEHICLE CODE, LAGUNA NIGUEL MUNICIPAL CODE &
CEQA, & COMPLAINT FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION & DECLARATOR Y & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

TENTH CAUSE OF ACTION
2 (Injunction)

3 139, EQR realleges and incorporates, as though fully set forth herein, each and every

4 allegation in paragraphs 1 through 138 of this Petition and Complaint,

5 140. The actions of the City, as described above, are illegal and invalid, and in clear
violation of the Vehicle Code, the Municipal Code, the General Plan, and CEQA. BQR is entitled
to preliminary and permanent injunctive relief enjoining the City from taking any action to
8 implement or enforce the Somerset HOA and Sterling HOA permit parking districts, and any other
9 parking restrictions or permit parking districts, until and unless the City has complied with the
10 Vehicle Code, the Municipal Code, the City's General Plan, and CEQA, and prepared appropriate

11 CEQA level documents.

12 141. For all of the reasons set forth above, EQR has strong probability of prevailing on

13 the merits, and of establishing misconduct by the City arising out of its violations of law and its

14 statutory and regulatory obligations under the Vehicle Code, the Municipal Code, the General

15 Plan, CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines.

16 142, Unless BQR is granted injunctive relief, it and residents of the City, including

17 Windridge residents, will suffer irreparable harm in that the implementation and enforcement of

18 the permit parking districts will cause significant irreparable harm and adverse impacts and

191 prejudice to EQR, Windridge residents, and all residents of the City, and will create adverse
20 environmental impacts, as previously described herein, to the detriment of EQR, Windridge
21 residents, and all residents of the City. Absent direct and immediate intervention by this Court,

22 EQR, Windridge residents, other City residents, and the public in general, will suffer irreparable

23 and irreversible injury as a result of the City's failure to comply with the Vehicle Code, the

24 Municipal Code, the General Plan, and CEQA.

25 143. If the City is allowed to implement and enforce the permit parking districts without
26 compliance with the Vehicle Code, Municipal Code, the General Plan, and CEQA, EQR and the

27 public will have no legal way to undo the harm and damage to EQR and Windridge residents, and

28 environmental harm and damage to sensitive resources, and no further recourse under the law.
30
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OP MANDATE FOR VIOLATION OF VEHICLE CODE. LAGUNA NIGUEL MUNICIPAL CODE &
CEQA, & COMPLAINT FOR INVERSÉ CONDEMNATION & DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

144. The City, by comparison, will suffer little or no harm if this Court grants the relief
requested herein, as there are no pending or significant parking problems within the areas affected
by the permit parking districts, and no need for any type of parking restriction, particularly
restrictions based on improper and discriminatory distinctions between City residents,
145. EQR lacks an adequate remedy at law because future monetary damages cannot be
6| ascertained and EQR cannot be compensated for the irreparable injury and environmental harm
7| and degradation, including public safety harm and threats, that would result from implementation

8 and enforcement of the permit parking districts, as described herein. No other means is available

9 to obtain judicial review of the City's actions, and no damages or other legal remedy can
101 adequately compensate for the irreparable harm EQR, as well as the local environment, and the
11 entire region, will suffer if the City is allowed to implement and enforce the permit parking
12 districts without complying with the Vehicle Code, Municipal Code and General Plan, and without
13 proper and complete CEQA review.
14 146. Therefore, EQR requests that this Court preliminarily and permanently enjoin the
15| City from taking any action to implement and enforce the Somerset HOA and Sterling HOA
16 permit parking districts, or any other parking restrictions or permit parking districts, pending trial
17 of this matter, and unless and until they have fully complied with the mandates of all applicable
18 statules and regulations, including CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines.
19 PRAYER FOR RELIEF
20 WHEREFORE, EQR prays for relief as follows:
21 I. That the Court enters judgment determining that the City's approval of the
22 Somerset HOA and Sterling HOA permit parking districts was illegal and is therefore null and
23| void;
24 2, For a writ of mandate commanding and ordering the City to:
25 a. vacate, rescind and set aside the City's approval of the Somerset HOA and
26 Sterling HOA permit parking districts based on the City's violations of and failure to comply with

8 Section 21168.9; and

d. vacate, rescind and set aside the City's approval of the Somerset HOA and
10 Sterling HOA permit parking districts based on the City's violations of its General Plan;
11 3. That the Court determine, declare and order as follows:

13 connection with its approval of the Somerset HOA and Sterling HOA permit parking districts;
14 b. that the City violated Laguna Niguel Municipal Code Section 7-4-607 in
15 connection with its approval of the Somerset HOA and Sterling HOA permit parking districts;

18 d. that the City violated its General Plan in connection with its approval of the
19 Somerset HOA and Sterling HOA permit parking districts;

21| and refrain from implementing or enforcing the two permit parking districts, or engaging in any
22 action related to the permit parking districts, or any other parking restrictious, until it takes
23| necessary action to comply with the Vebicle Code, the Municipal Code, the General Plan, and 24| CEQA with regard to the permit parking districts;
