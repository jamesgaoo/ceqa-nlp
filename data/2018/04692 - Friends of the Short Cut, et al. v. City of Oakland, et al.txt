Plaintiffs Friends of The Short Cut and Patrick Sheahan allege:
2 This Petition challenges the actions of Respondents CITY OF OAKLAND and CITY COUNCIL OF
3 THE CITY OF OAKLAND ("CITY") in carrying out a project identified as "Repairs to City stair path #137
4 called the 'Short Cut' Alvarado Road descending to the Claremont Hotel parking lot" (Project). Plaintiff

5 FRIENDS OF THE SHORT CUT alleges that the City's actions violate applicable provisions of the

6 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code §§ 21000 et seq. The City

7 improperly relied on categorical and statutory exemptions from CEQA even though it is clear that the Project

8 as now planned would result in unmitigated significant impacts to an historic resource.
2. Plaintiffs seek a writ of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085 and/or 1094.5 prohibiting
the City from implementing the Project without adequate CEQA review. Plaintiffs also seek a stay of 10 decision during the pendency of these proceedings suspending the City's authority to take any furtber actions 11 regarding the Project and a interim and permanent injunctive relief enjoining action by the City that could 12 result in changes to the physical environment unless and until the City complies with CEQA. Plaintiffs seek
13 an award of costs and attorney's fees under Code of Civil Procedure § 1021.5, together with any other relief
14 the Court deems necessary and proper.
15 Parties

16 3. Petitioner FRIENDS OF THE SHORT CUT is an unincorporated association with its principal place
17 of business is Oakland, California. Friends of The Short Cut's organizational purpose is to preserve and
18 protect the historic and cultural value of The Short Cut while ensuring a repair project that would permit safe
19 use of the facility. FRIENDS OF THE SHORT CUT'S members include residents, taxpayers, and electors

20 who reside in the City of Oakland and Alameda County and who currently enjoy the cultural and historic

21 values, ambiance, views, historic plantings, and mobility provided by The Short Cut and which are

22 threatened if the City implements the currently proposed Project without environmental review and

23 mitigation.

a. Petitioner PATRICK SHEAHAN is an individual who owns and resides at 2728 Russell 24

25 Street, in Berkeley, California, about five or six blocks from The Short Cut. Petitioner SHEAHAN
grew up on 2639 Russell Street, about six or seven blocks from The Short Cut. Petitionerl
26 SHEAHAN is a licensed architect and a Commissioner on the City of Berkeley Zoning Adjustments
27 Board. Petitioner SHEAHAN enjoys the cultural and historic values, ambiance, views, historic

l plantings, and mobility provided by The Short Cut, which are threatened if the City implements the
2 currently proposed Project without environmental review and mitigation.
3 b. Friends of the Short Cut's members and Petitioner a Sheahan have a clear and present right
4 to, and beneficial interest in, the City's performance of its duties to comply with CEQA. As citizens,

5 homeowners, taxpayers, and electors, Friends of The Short Cut's members and Petitioner Sheahan

6 are within the class of persons to whom the City owes such duties. Friends of The Short Cut's

7 members and Petitioner Sheahan will also suffer direct injury as a result of the adversel

8 environmental, aesthetic, and land use impacts caused by the Project. These include loss of cultural
and historic values, ambiance, views, historic plantings, and mobility provided by The Short Cut.

10 By this action, Friends of The Short Cut seeks to protect the interests of its members and to enforce
public duty owed to them by the City.
11 5. Plaintiffs and members of Friends of The Short Cut have objected to the City's proposed Project in
12 emails and appearances at public meetings in July and August 2018 when the members became aware that
13 the City had changed the scope of the Project identified in the 2014 Notice of Exemption.
14 6. Respondent City of Oakland is municipality of the State of California. Respondent Oakland City
15 Council is the governing legislative body of the City. The City and its City Council (collectively the "City")
16 are the governing land use authorities for the Project challenged in this action and the lead agency for
17 purpose of complying with CEQA.
18 7. On May 20, 2014, the City Council adopted Resolution No. 84988 authorizing the City
19 Administrator to request an allocation of State Transportation Development Act Article 3 funds for the

20 Project, finding that the Project as then described was exempt from CEQA. The City has acted as the lead

21 agency responsible under CEQA for evaluating the environmental impacts of the Project.

22 8. Does 1 to 25 are fictitiously named respondents whose true names and capacities are currently

23 unknown to Plaintiffs. If and when their true names and capacities are known, this petition will be amended
to assert them.

Background Facts 25
9.
26 The Short Cut is a 16' wide and roughly 300' long footpath leading down the steep bill betweenl
Lower Alvarado Road to the Hotel Claremont's south parking area near Tunnel Road in the City of Oakland.
27 The Short Cut features stone steps and retaining walls which appear to have been quarried and constructed
28 al the same time as the Hotel Claremont (1906-1914). The designed curvilinear entry off of Alvarado Road

1 to the first descending steps and these steps are composed of stonework and feature a rustic bench resting
2 on three stones. The Short Cut is lined with Royal Palms planted by the hotel circa 1915, as well as other
3 mature trees.

4 10. The Short Cut contains three segments. The western segment consists of concrete steps rising from

5 Tunnel Road, some of which are broken and tilted. The central segment consists of a long sloping asphalt

6 pathway. The eastern segment consists of stonework steps rising to the curvilinear landing off of Alvarado
Road.

11. The Claremont Hotel, adjacent to The Short Cut, was found eligible for the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) and is listed on the California Register of Historical Resources (CRHR) in 2003.

10 The nomination for historical resource eligibility included both the Hotel and its adjacent grounds and
gardens.
11 12. The Short Cut was constructed contemporaneously with the Claremont Hotel and uses stonel
12 materials and workmanship consistent with the Claremont Hotel. The Short Cut, with its bordering palm
13 trees, is connected thematically and visually to the rest of the Hotel Claremont grounds, where palms were
14| featured prominently.
15 13. The Short Cut meets the criteria for a historic resource under CEQA because it is associated with
16 events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of California's history and cultural
17 heritage.
18 14: The Short Cut also meets the criteria for a historic resource under CEQA because it embodies the
19 distinctive characteristics of a type, period, region, or method of construction, or represents the work of an
20  important creative individual, or possesses high artistic values.

21 15, Construction of the Project, as now planned, would constitute a significant adverse impact to a

22 resource that meets CEQA's criteria for a historic resource by materially altering the character-defining

23 features which allow it to retain integrity.

24 Procedural History
16.
25 On April 2, 2014, a staff report to the City Council recommended that the City apply for a grant from

26 the State Transportation Development Act Article 3 funds for The Short Cut Project. The staff report
described the project as follows: "The Rehabilitation of the Short Cut Stair Path at Alvarado Road will
27 correct trip-and-fall issues by replacing concrete steps and landings, and installing handrails. The stair path
28 IS adjacent to the renovated Eucalyptus Stair and connects Alvarado Road to Tunnel Road, serving a

1 commercial district, transit, and an elementary school. Identified as stair path #137, the rehabilitation of the
2 Short Cut is a priority based on a citywide inventory and ranking of the City's stairs and paths."
3 17. The staff report does not indicate that The Short Cut Project would include any changes to the middle
4 section of The Short Cut, consisting of a sloping asphalt path, or that the Project would make any changes

5 to the rock stairs at the east end of The Short Cut. The staff report does not indicate that The Short Cut

6 Project would include any changes to accommodate bicycle use such as bicycle channel or runnel.

7 18. On May 20, 2014, the City Council adopted Resolution No. 84988 authorizing the City

8 Administrator to request an allocation of State Transportation Development Act Article 3 funds for the

9 "Rehabilitation of the Short Cut Stair Path at Alvarado Road" project.
19.
10 On May 23, 2014, the City filed a Notice of Exemption (NOE) under CEQA for The Short Cut

11 Project identified as "Repairs to City stair path #137 called the 'Short Cut' Alvarado Road descending to
the Claremont Hotel parking lot" (emphasis added).
12 20. The NOE project description states "[g]enerally, repairs include the replacement of broken, tilted|
13 concrete at walkways or steps, the addition of code complaint handrails at steps and sloping walkways, and
14 street signs" (emphasis added).
15 21. The NOE project description did not identify any changes to the rock stairs, any changes to the
16 sloping asphalt path comprising the middle section of The Short Cut, or any provision of bicycle facilities.
17 22. The NOE states that The Short Cut Project is exempt from CEQA under the "General Rule {Sec
18 15061(b)(3)}," and under categorical exemptions for "Existing Facilities (Sec 15301(c) (f)) and Minor
19 Alterations (Sec 15304 (h))."

20 23. In April 2016, Project neighbors became aware of a March 15, 2016, e-mail from Jeff Krohn,

21 identified as the Project architect for the City (then with the City's Bureau of Engineering and Construction,

22 now with the City's Department of Transportation), that indicated that the scope of the Project might include

23 replacement of the sloping middle section of The Short Cut with stairs and landings and replacement of the

24 rock steps with concrete steps.
24.
25 On April 29, 2016, a Project neighbor, David Kessler, emailed Jeff Krohn, the architect for the City

26 (then with the Bureau of Engineering and Construction, now with the Department of Transportation).
Kessler explained that the neighbors were concerned about the potential loss of features of distinctive
27 character and historical significance and the potential impacts on users with wheeled vehicles. Kessler

requested drawings of The Short Cut Project and asked the City to convene a public meeting to discuss the
2 work before it commences.

3 25. In response, on April 29, 2016, City architect Krohn advised neighbor Kessler by email that the City

4 had not surveyed the site and no design work had begun. Krohn told Kessler that "when the design is at

5 65%, citizens using or bordering the stair path shall participate in a review." Krohn explained that such a

6 public meeting would usually be coordinated by the council district member, Mr. Dan Kalb, but that Krohn

7 had not contacted him yet because "all is premature."

8 26. On June 1, 2016, neighbor Rani Marx asked City architect Krohn for information on the stair Project.

9 Krohn responded on June 2, 2016, that the Project was still under design so no drawings were ready yet for
public comment.
10 27. On June 15, 2017, neighbor Justin Baldwin requested that City architect Krohn advise him of the
11

12 status of the Project and expressed concern that the Project might affect the historical protection of the
property. Krohn did not respond to that request for more than a year.
13 28. Despite its commitment for public review of the Project design before it was finalized, the City did
14 not schedule a design meeting with the neighbors or advise them of the Project plans before July 2018.
15 29. Friends of The Short Cut are informed and believe that the City entered into a contract with Bay
16 Construction Company to construct the Project prior to July 2018 without a noticed public hearing on the
17 contract.
18 30. On July 6, 2018, Bay Construction Company notified Project neighbors via door hangers that it had
19 contracted with the City for "replacement of the pedestrian stair path" and that it would begin construction

20 on July 16, 2018. The door hanger advised neighbors with questions or concerns to contact Jeffrey S.

21 Krohn, identified as City of Oakland Resident Engineer.

22 31. On July 9, 2018, neighbor Marx addressed the meeting of the Oakland Landmarks Preservation

23 Advisory Board during its Open Forum to object that the City had not honored its commitment to provide

24 plans or to permit public participation in Project design.
32.
25 On July 10, 2018, neighbor Marx learned from City architect/engineer Krohn that the City had

26 decided not to hold a public meeting or to consider public comments on the Project design because the City

27 believed it to be a small job a that could not be adjusted by the public . Krohn represented that the City had
"melded the historical and required access goals attractively."

- 33. On July 11, 2018, Tom Debley, president of Oakland Heritage Alliance, wrote to City
2 architect/engineer Krohn and members of the City's Planning and Zoning Bureau, Public Works
3 Department, and Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board to explain that The Short Cut could be a cultural
4 resource and subject to designation as a Heritage Property. Debley pointed out the City's obligation under
5 its General Plan Historic Preservation Element to preserve historic resources and to conduct CEQA review

6 of projects that affect historic resources. Debley urged postponement of the Project construction to allow

7 consideration of alternatives that would preserve the historic character of The Short Cut, CEQA review of

8 the historic resource, and a hearing to consider landmark designation.
34.
9 On July 11, 2018, neighbor Kessler emailed City architect/engineer Krohn to request that a public

10 meeting be held before Project plans were finalized.
35. On July 13, 2018, City architect/engineer Krohn advised neighbors that the City would hold a public 11 meeting on July 17, 2018. Krohn provided a Dropbox link to the Project drawings, which are identified as
12 the "100% bid set 12-16-16."
13 36. On July 13, 2018, neighbor Marx emailed City staff to request postponement of the Project until the
14 City considers historic preservation requirements and the public has the opportunity to comment on the
15 plans.
16 37. On July 17,2018, counsel for the Claremont Preservation Coalition notified the City that the Project
17 may have a significant effect on the historic character and aesthetics of The Short Cut and objected to
18 implementation of the plan without CEQA review.

19 38. On July 17, 2018, the City held a public meeting to discuss the Project with neighbors.

20 39. As a result of the July 17, 2018, meeting and review of the Project plans provided by City
21 architect/engineer Krohn on July,13, 2018, neighbors learned that the contract already awarded for The Short

22 Cut Project goes well beyond the proposed "replacement of broken, tilted concrete at walkways or steps, the

23 addition of code complaint handrails at steps and sloping walkways, and street signs" described in the 2014

24 Notice of Exemption. For example, the Project would alter the existing stone stairs by covering them with

25 concrete. The Project would entirely rebuild the sloping asphalt path that comprises the middle section of

26 The Short Cut with series of concrete stairs and landings. The Project would add a bicycle runnel to all
of the new concrete stairs. The Project would narrow portions of The Short Cut to 44 inches. None of these
27 changes were identified in the 2014 Notice of Exemption.

1 40. On July 30, 2018, neighbor Baldwin objected to City architect/engineer Krohn that Krohn had not
2 responded to Baldwin's June 15, 2017, request for project status. Baldwin expressed concern about the
3 Project impact on an historic resource and the need for a public review. On July 30, 2018, City
4 architect/engineer Krohn responded to Baldwin that, although he had previously told the public that there
5 would be a review, "my administration at the time considered it a right of way repair, and thus a minor code

6 required upgrade which did not involve the public." Krohn stated that the City staff had "retained the

7 historical elements of the path in the final design, which we felt accommodated both its history and provided

8 for new accessibility to more path users.'
41. In July and August, 2018, hundreds of neighbors petitioned the City to designate The Short Cut as

10 a Heritage Property and to postpone Project construction until alternatives are considered.
42. On August 3, 2018, neighbor Justin Baldwin submitted a Notice of Intent to Submit Oakland
1.1 Landmark and S-7 Preservation Combining Zone Application to the Oakland Landmarks Preservation 12 Advisory Board. Baldwin requested that the application to designate The Short Cut as a Heritage Property
13 be considered on an expedited basis in view of the City's plan to commence construction. Baldwin objected
14 to any plan to replace the stone steps with concrete or to replace the asphalt path with concrete steps and
15 ramps, destroying the cultural significance of The Short Cut and potentially damaging the bordering trees.
16 43. On August 5, 2018, neighbor Marx objected to City architect/engineer Krohn that the July 17, 2018,
17 meeting had not provided the opportunity for community participation in design that Krohn had promised
18 in 2016. Krohn acknowledged that "senior management felt the project too small in scope to warrant a
19 community meeting."

20 44. On August 9, 2018, City architect/engineer Krohn advised the neighbors that the City had made some

21 changes to the original Project design to accommodate community input, including preserving stone walls

22 on either side of the stairs, changing the color of the handrails and cement, and adding a bicycle channel.

23 Krohn advised the neighbors that the City would host a public meeting on August 16, 2018, to discuss design

24 changes.
45.
25 On August 10, 2018, neighbor Marx advised City architect/engineer Krohn that the City had not

26 provided sufficient lead time to permit public participation and requested : second meeting in September.
Marx identified the neighbors' priorities as making the path safe while preserving its historic character and 27 appearance. Marx explained that this would entail rebuilding the stone steps rather than covering them with

3 46. On August 13, 2018, the City's Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board agenda included an update
4 of the "DOT project to upgrade the 'cut through ."" The agenda did not contain an action item to consider

5 the application to designate The Short Cut as Heritage Property.

6 47. Friends of The Short Cut is informed and believes that at the August 13, 2018, Landmarks

and after the treatment.

10 Friends of The Short Cut is informed and believes that at the August 13, 2018, Landmarks

11 the application for Heritage Property Designation should be denied.
12 49. On August 16, 2018, the City held a public meeting attended by neighbors to discuss the Project.
13 50; At the August 16, 2018, meeting, Friends of The Shortcut submitted a letter objecting to the Project
14 as proposed. The letter objected to the proposal to replace the path with concrete and to provide bicycle
15 accommodations not previously evaluated.

18 52. Friends of The Short Cut is informed and believes that at the August 16, 2018, meeting City staff.

19 indicated construction would commence on September 4, 2018.

21 of construction on the basis of the Project plans that had been disclosed to the public in July and August;

22 2018. In its August 28, 2018, letter, Friends of The Short Cut explained that the Project as now planned to

23 be constructed differs materially from the Project as described in the 2014 Notice of Exemption.

24 54. In its August 28, 2018, letter, Friends of The Short Cut provided an expert opinion from Kara

25 Brunzell that The Short Cut is an historic resource. Brunzell explained that construction of the Project as
now planned would result in a significant impact to that historic resource. 26 55. In its August 28, 2018, letter, Friends of The Short Cut offered to meet with City staff to discuss and

- commencement of construction until the City undertakes a valid CEQA review of the Project as now

3 56. On August 29, 2018, counsel for Friends of The Short Cut notified the City of its intent to commence

4 an action under CEQA alleging that the City violated CEQA by approving a contract for the Project as now
s planned . Friends of The Short Cut notified the City that it would seek temporary relief to prohibit the City

6 from implementing the Project as now planned unless and until the City complies with CEQA.

7 57. On August 29, 2018, the City and Friends of The Short Cut agreed that the City would postpone the

8 start of the Project to September 18, 2018, in consideration of Friends of The Short Cut not seeking a

9 temporary restraining order on September 4, 2018.

10 On August 29, 2018, neighbor Baldwin requested that his notice of intent to nominate The Short Cut
as Heritage Property, received by the City on August 3, 2018, but not placed on the agenda for the August 11 13, 2018, meeting of the Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board, be considered at the September 17,2018
12 Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board meeting. Baldwin explained that the application is on the desk of
13 a planner and action is urgent in light of the plan to initiate construction on September 4, 2018. City planner
14 Peterson Vollman replied that the City may not own the property but only the easement and that there are
15 "issues with regard to owner notice and consent." Vollman said he would probably provide "clear direction
16 in the next couple of days."

20 Code of Civil Procedure sections 393 and 395.

21 Statute of Limitations

17 class of persons by ensuring that Respondent City does not approve the Project in the absence of lawful
18 environmental review.

19 65. Plaintiffs are entitled to recover attorneys' fees as provided in Code of Civil Procedure § 1021.5 if

20 it prevails in this action and the Court finds that a significant benefit has been conferred on the general

21 public or a large class of persons, and that the necessity and burden of private enforcement is such as to

22 make an award of fees appropriate. Plaintiffs have no substantial financial interest in the subject matter of

23 this action and Plaintiffs bring this action in the public interest.

24 Necessity for Interim Injunctive Relief
66.
25 If the Project is allowed to proceed prior to the Court's final judgment on the merits, Plaintiffs and

26 the environment will be greatly, permanently and irreparably injured from the resulting unmitigated|
environmental, aesthetic, recreational, and land use impacts.
27 67. Under Code of Civil Procedure $ 1094.5(g), this Court may issue a stay order during the pendency
28 of the proceedings unless it is satisfied that a stay would be against the public interest. Imposition of a stay

- would not be against the public interest in that the public will derive no benefit from the Project prior to the
2 Court's final judgment.

3 68. Under Code of Civil Procedure sections 526 and 527 this a Court may issue a restraining order or
4 preliminary injunction during the pendency of the proceedings. Interim injunctive relief is warranted l

5 because Plaintiffs are likely to prevail on the merits and because commencement of physical development

6 activities will cause great and irreparable injury.

7 First Cause of Action
(Violations of CEQA)
8 69. Plaintiffs incorporate all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.
9 70. At all times relevant to this action the City was the lead agency responsible for the review and
10 approval of the Project under Public Resources Code § 21067.
11 71. An activity is a "project" subject to CEQA if it is a discretionary activity undertaken by a public]
12 agency that may cause a direct or reasonably foreseeable indirect physical effect on the environment. PRC,
13 § 21080, CEQA Guidelines, § 15378.)

14 72. An agency may not rely on the "common sense exemption" for a project unless it can be seen with
15 certainty that there is no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant effect on the

16 environment. (14 C.C.R. § 15061(b)(3).) The Brunzell letter conclusively establishes that the Project may|

17 have a significant effect on the environment. Therefore, the City's decision to exempt the Project from

18 CEQA review based on the "common sense exemption" represents prejudicial abuse of discretion.
73.
19 CEQA provides that "a categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may cause

20 substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource." 14 C.C.R. § 15300.2(h). The

21 Brunzell letter conclusively establishes that The Short Cut is a historical resource and that the Project may
cause a substantial adverse change in its significance. Therefore, the City's decision to exempt the Project
22 from CEQA review based on the Class 1 and 4 categorical exemption represents a prejudicial abuse of
23 discretion.
24 74. The City prejudicially abused its discretion by failing to proceed as required by CEQA because it
25 relied on mitigation or a project alternative a in order to justify its continued treatment of the Project as
26 exempt. (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network v. County of Marin (2004) 125 CalApp.4th 1098, 1102;
27 Azusa Land Reclamation Co. V. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997) 52 CalApp.4th 1165, 1200.)

75. Plaintiffs have no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law and will
2 suffer irreparable injury unless this Court issues the writ of mandate prayed for below.

3 Prayer for Relief

4 WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for entry of judgment as follows:

5 76. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing the City:

6 a. to set aside its May 23, 2014, Notice of Exemption finding that the Project is exempt from

7 CEQA;

b.
8 to set aside its May 20, 2014, Resolution No. 84988 approving the Project and making

9 findings that it is exempt from CEQA;

C.
10 to comply with CEQA in any subsequent action or actions taken to approve the Project;
77.
11 For other relief that prevents the City's actions, determinations, and approvals for the Project from
taking effect and/or that requires the City to rescind, modify, or invalidate its actions related to the Project;
12 78. For an order granting temporary relief, including an order prohibiting the City and its agents from
13 proceeding with the Project pending the outcome of this proceeding;
14 79. For a preliminary and permanent injunction directing the City to cease and refrain from engaging in
15 any action related to the Project that could result in any change or alteration in the physical environment until
16 the City takes any necessary action to bring its action into compliance with CEQA.
17 80. For its costs of suit;

18 81. For an award of attorneys' fees, including attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §
19 1021.5 and/or the catalyst theory; and

20 82. For other legal or equitable relief that the Court deems just and proper.
