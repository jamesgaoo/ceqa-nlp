RE: Notice to Attorney General of Commencement of Action against the City of Davis

To the Attorney General of the State of California:

Please take notice, under Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388, that on April 12, 2018, Susan Rainier filed a petition for writ of mandate under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq. (CEQA"), against the City of Davis ("City") and Real Parties in Interest Highbridge Properties, LLC and Olive Drive East, LLC. The Petition challenges Respondent's March 13, 2018 decisions, and all subsequent actions, in approving: a General Plan amendment; Gateway / Olive Drive Specific Plan amendment; development agreement; affordable housing plan; lot merger; and other associated entitlements purporting to authorize the Lincoln40 development project, which includes a 249,788 square-foot multi-family residential building, parking areas, and various amenities (the "Project"). The lawsuit will be based on violations of CEQA and other claims, as discussed more fully in the Project's administrative and environmental review proceedings. The exact nature of the allegations and relief sought is described in the Petition for Writ of Mandate, and is attached to this notice as Exhibit A.

Very truly yours,

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. Petitioner SUSAN RAINIER ("Petitioner") petitions this court for a Writ of

3 Mandate ("Petition"), directed to Respondent CITY OF DAVIS ("Respondent" or "City") and

4 Real Parties in Interest HIGHBRIDGE PROPERTIES, LLC and OLIVE DRIVE EAST, LLC

5 (collectively "Real Party"). Petitioner challenges Respondent's March 13, 2018 decisions, and

6 all subsequent actions, in approving: a General Plan amendment; Gateway / Olive Drive

7 Specific Plan amendment; development agreement; affordable housing plan; lot merger; and

8 other associated entitlements (collectively the "Entitlements"). These Entitlements purport to

9 authorize the Lincoln40 development project, which includes a 249,788 square-foot multi-

10 family residential building, parking areas, and various amenities (the "Project"). The Project site
11 is approximately 5.92 acres in the City of Davis, located immediately south of the Union Pacific

12 Railroad (the "Project Site").
13 2. In certifying an Environmental Impact Report for the Project, Respondent

14 prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law, including

15 but not limited to its failure to comply with substantive mandates under the California

16 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") requiring analysis of all environmental impacts.

17 Respondent's EIR did not provide adequate analysis of, or identify adequate mitigation

18 measures for, the Project's individual and cumulative impacts, including but not limited to its

19 impacts on hazardous materials, land use, biological resources, traffic, and air quality.
20 Apparently cognizant of the defects in its EIR, Respondent also made a finding that the Project

21 is exempt from CEQA, a finding not supported by any evidence in the record.
22 3. Respondent also prejudicially abused its discretion by approving the General Plan
23 amendment, Specific Plan amendment, and other Entitlements because the Project is
24 inconsistent with the Gateway / Olive Drive Specific Plan and City of Davis General Plan.

25 4. Because Respondent's approval of the Project and certification of the EIR violates

26 these requirements, the Project Entitlements and related approvals must be overturned.

27 Therefore, Petitioner requests that the Court direct Respondent to set aside its actions approving
28 the Project and its Entitlements.

1 PARTIES

2 5. Petitioner SUSAN RAINIER is a Davis resident and California-licensed architect

3 with international design and construction experience. Ms. Rainier is Chair of AIA Central

4 Valley Committee on the Environment, and is also speaker and writer addressing man-made

5 climate disruption for water reform, healthy net zero energy buildings, ecologically balanced
6 infrastructure, biomimicry, interdisciplinary integrated collaboration, sustainable behavior
7 education, and Living Buildings & Living Communities. Ms. Rainier is also an advocate for
8 restorative, regenerative, resiliency planning and development that respects natural ecosystems
9 and diversity, and that addresses social equity. Petitioner brings this action on behalf of herself
10 and all others similarly situated who will be affected in the Davis area, as well as for all
11 residents in the County of Yolo, including all those who seek to maintain sensible planning in
12 the land use entitlement process.
13 6. Respondent the CITY OF DAVIS is a municipal corporation, organized under the
14  law of the state of California, and exercising local government power. The City is the CEQA is
15 "lcad agency" for the Project, and is responsible for preparation of an environmental document
16 that describes the Project, its impacts, and, if necessary, mitigation measures and alternatives to
17 lessen or avoid any significant environmental impacts. The Project is within the City's
18 jurisdictional limits.

19 7. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of respondents DOES
20 through 10, and sues such respondents by fictitious names. Petitioner is informed and believes,
21 and on that basis alleges, that the fictitiously named respondents are also responsible for the
22 actions described in this Petition. When the true identities and capacities of these respondents
23 have been determined, Petitioner will amend this Petition, with leave of court if necessary, to
24 insert such identities and capacities.

25 8. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that real party in
26 interest HIGHBRIDGE PROPERTIES, LLC is the applicant and proposed developer for the
27 Project.

28 9. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that real party in

1 interest OLIVE DRIVE EAST, LLC is the applicant and proposed developer for the Project.

2 10. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of real parties in interest,

3 DOES 11 through 50, and sues such real parties in interest by fictitious names. Petitioner is

4 informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that the fictitiously named real parties are also

5 directly and materially affected by the actions described in this Petition. When the true

6 identities and capacities of these real parties have been determined, Petitioner will amend this

7 Petition, with leave of court if necessary, to insert such identities and capacities.

8 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

9 11. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to
10 Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21167,

11 21168 and 21168.5.

12 12. Venue is proper in Yolo County Superior Court in accordance with Code of Civil
13 Procedure section 394, subdivision (a), among others, because the Project is located in Yolo
14 County.

15 STANDING

16 13. Petitioner has-standing to assert the claims alleged in this Petition because she is

17 beneficially interested in this matter, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1086.

18 Petitioner lives, works, and conducts business within the City of Davis and will be directly
19 impacted by the Project. In addition, unless the relief requested herein is granted, the
20 environment will be adversely affected and injured by Respondent's failure to comply with
21 CEQA in approving the Project and certifying the EIR.
22 14. Petitioner actively participated in the Project's administrative approval process to

23 try to ensure Respondent complied with CEQA and all other applicable laws in processing Real

24 Party's application for Project Entitlements.
25 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

26 15. Petitioner has performed or will perform all conditions precedent to the filing of

27 this Petition, and has actively participated in the administrative and environmental review
28 process prior to close of the public hearings on the Project and before the issuance of the notice

CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

- of determination, and thus has fully exhausted her administrative remedies. (Pub. Resources
2 Code, § 21177, subd. (a).)

3 16. Petitioner submitted written comment letters and appeared before Respondent to
4 advocate for required changes to the Project.

5 17. Respondent has taken final agency actions certifying the EIR and approving the
6 Project Entitlements. Respondent had a mandatory duty to comply with all applicable laws,
7 including, but not limited to, CEQA and the state planning and zoning laws, prior to undertaking
8 the discretionary approvals at issue in this lawsuit. Petitioner possesses no effective remedy to
9 challenge the approvals at issue in this action other than by means of this lawsuit.
10 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

11 18. On March 13, 2018, or soon thereafter, Respondent posted the Notice of
12 Determination ("NOD") for the Project.
13 19. The statute of limitations for a CEQA challenge to Respondent's decision to
14 certify the Project EIR expires 30 days from the filing and posting of the NOD. (Guidelines, §§
15 15094, subd. (g), 15112, subd. (c)(1).)
16 20. The statute of limitations for challenges based on inconsistency with the General
17 and Specific Plan expires 90 days from their approval. (Gov. Code, § 65009, subd. (c).)
18 21. Petitioner filed its Petition prior to the expiration of any applicable statute of
19 limitations.

20 NOTICE OF CEOA SUIT

21 22. On April 12, 2018, Petitioner served a notice of its intent to file this lawsuit, in

A LAW Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate CORPORATION

1 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE

2 24. Petitioner brings this action as a private attorney general pursuant to Code of

3 Civil Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important

4 rights affecting the public interest.

5 25. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a significant benefit on

6 the general public by requiring Respondent to carry out its duties under CEQA and other

7 applicable laws before approving the Project.

8 26. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will also result in the enforcement

9 of important rights affecting the public interest by compelling Respondent to engage in a
10 legally adequate analysis of the Project, and to ensure that the public has meaningful

11 opportunity to review and comment on the impacts and mitigation measures for the Project.

12 27. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement make an award of attorneys'
13 fees appropriate in this case. Without this Petition, Respondent and Real Party will proceed
14 with a development that will cause significant, unmitigated environmental impacts that might

15 otherwise have been reduced or avoided through legally adequate environmental review and the
16 adoption of feasible mitigation measures.

17 ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS ACTIONS

18 28. Petitioner asserts that Respondent acted arbitrarily and capriciously when
19 certifying the EIR and approving the Project Entitlements.

20 29. In accordance with Government Code section 800, and other applicable laws,
21 Petitioner is entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees for bringing this Petition to overturn

22 Respondent's arbitrary or capricious actions.

23 IRREPARABLE HARM

24 30. Petitioner who resides and works in the City of Davis and the public at large have
25 | been harmed by Respondent's failure to provide environmental documents that accurately and
26 fully inform interested persons of the Project's true impacts. Such documents would lead to
27  better environmental decision-making regarding the Project, and would enable all residents,

28

MESERVE 5

CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

land owners, and business owners in the affected region to better understand the true

2 environmental impacts of the Project.

3 31. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

4 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondent to set aside its
5 approval of the Project. In the absence of such remedies, Respondent's decisions will remain in

6 effect in violation of State law and Petitioner will be irreparably harmed. No monetary
7 damages or legal remedy could fully and adequately compensate Petitioner for that harm.

8 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
9 The Project Site
10 32. The Project Site is located along Olive Drive, within the Gateway/Olive Drive
11 Specific Plan, in the City of Davis. The Site is directly adjacent to the Union Pacific Railroad
12 and its existing uses include a fully-occupied 14-unit apartment complex, 10 single-family
13 homes, and a vacant field with approximately 180 mature trees. The Project Site is designated
14 East Olive Multiple Use and Residential Medium Density in the Gateway / Olive Drive
15 Specific Plan ("Specific Plan"). According to that Plan, the East Olive Multiple Use district is
16 intended to be developed by creatively combining residential land uses with supporting retail,
17 office, and business uses. The Residential Medium Density district is intended for single-family
18 or multi-family residential development with densities from 4.2 to 10.0 units per acre. The
19 Specific Plan also provides "required" guidelines for development of the Project Site, known as
20 the "Callori" site, which limits development to 49 small-sized single-family cottage units and
21 8,000 square fect of commercial use. The City's Planning Staff confirmed that these restrictions
22 apply in an official interpretation letter dated October 9, 2008.
23 33. According to the Specific Plan, its land use regulations serve as the General Plan,
24 Specific Plan and zoning for the properties within the plan area. The Specific Plan purpose
25 provides an overarching framework for the development of the four sub-areas that make up the
26 Specific Plan area. The Project Site is located within the East Olive Drive subarea. The guiding
27 policy for the East Olive Drive subarea is: Any improvement or development within the
28

SOLURI
MESERVE 6
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

existing neighborhood of East Olive Drive must be compatible with the unique qualities of the
2 neighborhood. The East Olive Drive subarea is defined by its "cottage character."
3 The Project

4 34. The Project would demolish all existing buildings and construct a 249,788

5 square-foot student-oriented residential development. The Project would include 130 units, with

6 473 total bedrooms, 235 of which are designed as double-occupancy rooms resulting in a total

7 of 708 beds. The Project would be designed specifically as off-campus student-oriented

8 housing, and would not lease units, but individual beds. The Project would provide 240 parking

9 spaces.

10 Environmental Review

11 35, On or about August 29, 2016, Respondent circulated the Notice of Preparation for
12 the Project's Draft EIR and held a scoping meeting. A total of 24 comment letters and three

13 verbal comments were received on the Notice of Preparation.
14 36. On June 16, 2017, the Draft EIR for the Project was released for public review.
15 37. A total of 36 comment letters were submitted on the Draft EIR, including a letter
16 from Petitioner.

17 38. On or about December 6, 2017, Respondent published the Final EIR.

18 Project Approval

19 39. The Planning Commission held a hearing to consider the Project on January 10,
20 2018, and voted to recommend the City Council certify the Final EIR and approve the
21 Entitlements.

22 40. On March 13, 2017, the City Council held a hearing on the Project, where it

23 certified the Final EIR and approved the Project Entitlements.

24 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

25 Violation of CEQA

26 (Public Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)
27 41. Petitioner hereby re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding
28 paragraphs through 40, inclusive, in their entirety, as if fully set forth herein.

SOLURI
MESERVE 7
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 A. Mandatory Requirement of CEQA

2 42. CEQA prohibits local agencies from approving projects that may have adverse
3 environmental effects without first undergoing environmental review and avoiding or reducing

4 the significant environmental effects of those projects whenever feasible.

5 43. The EIR is an informational document that must disclose any potentially
6 significant environmental impacts of the project, and inform decision-makers and the general
7 public of mitigation measures and alternatives to the project that would avoid or substantially

8 lessen those impacts.
9 44. CEQA is designed to ensure that the public lead agency identifies all potentially
10 significant environmental impacts of a proposed project, adequately discloses those impacts to
11 the public, and implements all feasible alternatives or mitigation measures necessary to avoid or
12 substantially lessen those impacts. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21002, 21100; CEQA Guidelines,
13 §§ 15126.6, 15370.)
14 45. It is improper for an EIR to defer its analysis or the formulation of mitigation
15 measures until after certification of the EIR and approval of the project, and mitigation
16 measures must be enforceable and contain specific enforcement standards.
17 46. The EIR must also evaluate any impacts of the project that may be "cumulatively
18 considerable," and address the project's incremental effects when combined with the effects of
19 past, current, and probable future projects. (CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15064, subd. (h)(1), 15130,
20 subd. (a), 15355.)

21 47. When significant new information is added to a final EIR, CEQA requires that the
22 | lead agency recirculate the EIR for additional public review and comment. (Pub. Resources
23 Code, § 21092.1; CEQA Guidelines, § 15088.5, subd. (a).)
24 48. A lead agency cannot certify an EIR and approve a project with significant
25 environmental effects unless the agency makes a series of detailed findings. These include
26 findings that changes or alterations have been required that mitigate or avoid the project's
27 significant effects on the environment, or that specific considerations render the mitigation
28 measures or alternatives "infeasible" but that the benefits of the project nonetheless outweigh

SOLURI
MESERVE 8
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

the project's significant environmental effects. The lead agency's findings must be supported

2 by substantial evidence in the administrative record. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21081; CEQA

3 Guidelines, §§ 15091-15093.)

4 49. Noncompliance with the requirements outlined above constitutes a prejudicial

5 abuse of discretion under sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code, regardless

6 of whether a different outcome would have resulted if the lead agency had complied with those

7 requirements in the first place. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21005.) Abuse of discretion is

8 established if the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law or if the agency's
9 determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record.

10 (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21168, 21168.5.)

11 50. Failure to include essential information in the EIR is failure to proceed in the

12 manner required by law. (Banning Ranch Conservancy v. City of Newport Beach (2017) 2

13 Cal.5th 918.)

14 51. Acting as the CEQA lead agency, Respondent had a mandatory duty to comply

15 with CEQA prior to approving the discretionary actions at issue in this lawsuit.

16 B. Improper Determination That Project Is Exempt from CEQA

17 52. In an apparent attempt to create a litigation fallback position if a court finds

18 defects in the Project's EIR, Respondent found that the Project was exempt from CEQA under

19 Public Resources Code section 21155.1, which sets forth an exemption for "sustainable
20 communities projects."

21 53. To qualify for the sustainable communities projects exemption, a project must
22 among other things comply with certain environmental criteria. (Pub. Resources Code,
23 21155.1, subd. (a)(1)-(8).)

24 54. The California Supreme Court has explained that "[a]lthough CEQA does not
25 generally require an evaluation of the effects of existing hazards on future users of the proposed
26 project, it calls for such an analysis in several specific contexts [including] ... housing
27 development projects . . . [under Public Resources Code section] 21155.1, subd. (a)(4), (6)."

MESERVE 9
ALAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

F (California Building Industry Assn. V. Bay Area Air Quality Management Dist. (2015) 62
2 Cal.4th 369, 391.)

3 55. Section 21155.1, subdivision (a)(4) requires an agency to assess the potential for
4 exposure to significant hazards by preparing preliminary endangerment assessment. If after

5 preparing the assessment, the agency discovers a potential for exposure to significant hazards

6 from surrounding properties or activities, the effects of the potential exposure must be mitigated
7 to a level of insignificance in compliance with state and federal requirements. This requirement

8 applies to all projects relying on the sustainable communities project exemption.
9 56. A preliminary endangerment assessment was not prepared for the Project Site.
10 57. Instead, Respondent prepared a Phase Environmental Assessment for the

11 Project Site, which revealed that there are multiple contaminated sites nearby containing
12 significant levels of petroleum hydrocarbons and chlorinated solvents. One of these sites
13 (known as the former J.F. Wilson facility) is located only 80 feet north of the Project Site and is
14| known to be severely contaminated with the chlorinated solvent trichloroethene ("TCE"). TEC
15 is highly mobile and does not readily degrade into the subsurface. According to State Water
16 Quality Control Board data, the levels of TCE at the J.F. Wilson site are over 300 times greater
17 than the applicable environmental screening levels. Yet, there is no ongoing or approved
18 cleanup of that contamination. Studies conducted on the Project Site show that the
19 contamination has migrated to the Project Site, and that on-site TCE levels currently exceed the
20 applicable environmental levels by more than three times. That on-site contamination will
21 worsen over time because the plume is migrating toward the Project Site. Therefore, the Project
22 Site has potential to expose future residents to significant hazards. Yet. the Project does not
23 propose any mitigation for this potential exposure to significant hazards.
24 58. Section 21155.1, subdivision (a)(6)(C) requires, without the implementation of
25 project-specific mitigation, that the project not create a risk of a public health exposure at a
26 level that would exceed the standards established by any state or federal agency.
27 59. Substantial evidence shows that the Project would exceed health standards with
28 respect to air quality, noise, and hazardous materials. For example, during construction, the

SOLURI
10 MESERVE
ALAW Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate CORPORATION

1 Project would exceed acceptable cancer risks levels at nearby sensitive receptors as established

2 by several regional Air Quality Management Districts. During operation, the Project would

3 exceed indoor and outdoor noise thresholds established by the Environmental Protection

4 Agency, the California Governor's Office of Planning and Research, in partnership with the

5 Department of Health Service's Office of Noise Control, and the General Plan. The Project

6 Site also currently contains contamination that exceeds the San Francisco Bay Regional Water

7 Quality Control Board's Tier Environmental Screening Levels by almost threefold, and has

8 the potential to worsen over time because it is migrating from a significant source that is not

9 subject to any cleanup.

10 60. Section 21155.1, subdivision (a)(2)(A) requires, without the implementation of

11 project-specific mitigation, that the project not harm any species protected by the federal
12 Endangered Species Act, the Native Plant Protection Act, or the California Endangered Species
13 Act, and that the project not cause the destruction or removal of any species protected by a local

14 ordinance in effect at the time the application for the project was deemed complete.
15 61. Substantial evidence shows that during construction or operation, or both, the
16 Project has the potential to harm Swainson's hawk, burrowing owl, special-status bat species,

17 and special status plant species. For example, in 2016, a pair of Swainson's hawks were

18 actively nesting approximately 1,000 feet from the Project Site. Construction noise would harm
19 Swainson's hawks by disturbing them, especially if attempting to breed or raise their fledglings.
20 The Project Site provides suitable nesting and foraging habitat for this species. The Project

21 would also harm Swainson's hawks by eliminating suitable habitat. Therefore, the Project has
22 potential to harm special-status species.
23 62. To qualify for the sustainable communities project exemption, a project must also
24 incorporate any applicable mitigation measures and performance standards set forth in the
25 Sacramento Area Council of Government's ("SACOG") 2016 Metropolitan Transportation

26 Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy ("2016 MTP/SCS") EIR. (Pub. Resources Code, §
27 21155.1, subd. (b)(5).) The Project does not incorporate any mitigation measures or

28

SOLURI
MESERVE 11
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 performance standards set forth in SACOG's 2016 MTP/SCS EIR or its Mitigation Plan.
2 Therefore, the Project is not exempt from CEQA.

3 C. Defects In the EIR

4 63. In approving the Project and certifying the Final EIR, Respondent prejudicially

5 abused its discretion because its decision is not supported by substantial evidence and because

6 it failed to proceed in a manner required by law, as follows:

7 a. Hazardous Materials. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, evaluate, and
8 mitigate the Project's substantial adverse impact with respect to hazardous materials. The EIR
9 concludes that the Project's specific and cumulative impacts are less than significant, but the
10 conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence, as follows:
11 i. The Draft EIR does not disclose or analyze the significant
12 contamination at the former J.F. Wilson site or its potential to contaminate the Project Site. The
13 Phase 1 prepared for the Project Site failed to identify the J.F. Wilson site as a Recognized
14 Environmental Condition (even though it qualifies) and failed to conduct the level of analysis
15 appropriate for a site with such significant contamination.
16 ii. Neither the Draft EIR nor the Final EIR analyzed the potential for
17 any nearby contamination to have significant impacts on the Project Site in a future scenario,
18 despite the contamination migrating toward the Project Site.
19 iii. Neither the Draft EIR nor the Final EIR analyzed contamination
20 levels after Project construction, which may be greater than before, because the construction
21 will exacerbate existing conditions. Construction will exacerbate existing conditions because,
22 for example, any pipes or utility lines placed underground may play a large role in the spread
23 and migration of contamination. Typical pipe-bedding materials (such as crushed gravel or sand
24 placed in the bottom of a trench) can be more permeable and transmissive than the native
25 surrounding material, which make them preferential pathways for the migration of water and
26 vapors. The same is true for the planned pool and outdoor amenities.
27 iv. Neither the Draft EIR nor the Final EIR analyzed impacts from this
28 contamination other than existing potential for vapor inhalation. Thus, the EIR failed to

SOLURI
MESERVE 12
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 analyze, for example, the potential impacts from contact with contaminated soils or

2 groundwater. The EIR did not analyze the thresholds that are used for contaminated soil or

3 groundwater, which differ from the thresholds that were used.

4 V. Because the EIR did not analyze these impacts, it failed to

5 determine their significance, and failed to propose adequate mitigation and monitoring.
6 Feasible mitigation could be imposed to lessen these potential significant impacts, but no
7 mitigation was included as part of the Project. This failure will expose future residents to

8 significant environmental harm that could be avoided through feasible mitigation.

9 b. Traffic. The EIR's conclusions that the impacts to Davis roadways are less
10 than significant, or mitigated to a level of less than significant, are not supported by substantial

11 evidence, as follows:

12 i. The EIR does not include a related projects list but assumes traffic

13 conditions based on the General Plan at full build out. This underreports the trips in the future
14 cumulative scenario because it does not account for the numerous pending and planned projects
15 that are requesting General Plan amendments to develop at densities greater than that allowed
16 under existing land use designations.

17 ii. The EIR also does not account for modifications to planned

18 projects, such as the Nishi development project, and therefore utilizes inaccurate trip

19 distribution data when quantifying future cumulative impacts.

20 iii. Because the EIR does not include accurate information for its

21 cumulative impact analysis, its conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence.

22 C. Air Quality. The EIR's conclusions that the Project's air quality impacts

23 are less than significant, or mitigated to a level of less than significant, are not supported by

24 substantial evidence, as follows:

25 i. The EIR fails to quantify and assess the Project's cumulative air

26 quality impacts (existing + Project) on nearby sensitive receptors during the construction phase.
27 The Draft EIR does not quantify existing cancer risk levels for all nearby sensitive receptors
28 from all toxic air contaminants and diesel particulate matter, including ultra-fine emissions.

SOLURI
MESERVE 13
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

Existing cancer risk levels are significant because of the proximity to the Interstate-80 Highway
2 and Union Pacific Railway. During construction, the Project will exacerbate existing conditions

3 by contributing additional diesel particulate matter and toxic air contaminants from, among
4 other sources, diesel-powered equipment. The EIR therefore fails to assess a potentially

5 significant cumulative impact during construction phase.

6 ii. The EIR also fails to consider all volatile air contaminants, such as

7 benzene, toluene, and xylenes, or ultra-fine particle emissions, when quantifying the effects of
8 the proposed mitigation for construction air quality impacts. The Draft EIR found that, before
9 mitigation, Project construction would cause significant impacts on nearby sensitive receptors
10 because it will exceed the applicable cancer-risk threshold by over six times. While the Draft
11 EIR concludes that mitigation will reduce that impact below significance, it only analyzes
12 mitigation of particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in size, and does not analyze mitigation of
13 all cancer-causing air contaminants. Therefore the conclusion that the mitigation will reduce
14 impacts below levels of significance is not supported by substantial evidence.
15 iii. Because the EIR does not include this information, it fails as an
16 informational document and its conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence.
17 Additional feasible mitigation could be imposed to mitigate these potentially significant
18 impacts, but was not included as part of the Project. This failure will expose existing sensitive
19 receptors to significant environmental harm that could be avoided through feasible mitigation.
20 d. Land Use. The EIR fails to adequately analyze the Project's land use
21 impacts because it omits consideration of policies and objectives that apply to the Project Site:
22 i. For example, the EIR does not analyze consistency with Specific
23 Plan Goals 3-7, which include the goal to "Develop a plan which preserves the historic and
24 biotic qualities of the public area, while: a. respecting and promoting the historical character and
25 ambiance of the East Olive Drive neighborhood." The Specific Plan provides that the guiding
26 character is "cottage character" and "small-scale character." Specifically, the East Olive Drive
27 subarea limits development on the Project Site to 49 small-sized single-family cottage units and
28 8,000 square feet of commercial use. The Draft EIR omits analysis of how the Project is

SOLURI
MESERVE 14
A LaAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

consistent with the fundamental policy and objective of the Specific Plan to maintain cottage

2 character.

3 ii. The EIR also fails to address consistency with the requirement for

4 mixed-use development on the Project Site. According to the Specific Plan, when the zoning is

5 combined with the design guidelines, the vision for the district is predominantly an updated

6 version of the 1940-1950's concept of cottage/bungalow siting which successfully incorporates

7 residential and non-residential land uses needed by both the residents and the community. The

8 Specific Plan provides that the site must be developed with at least two of the following: (a)
9 multi-family; (b) restaurants; (c) professional and administrative offices; and (d) retail uses. The

10 EIR omits analysis of how the Project is consistent with this mixed-use policy and objective.

11 iii. The Draft EIR also relies on the requested entitlements to
12| demonstrate consistency with the General Plan and Specific Plan. However, consistency cannot

13 be demonstrated by assuming the requested entitlements have been granted.
14 e. Biological Impacts. The EIR fails to adequately analyze and mitigate the

15 Project's biological impacts, as follows:

16 i. The Draft EIR acknowledges that Swainson's hawks are known to

17 nest within the urban portion of the City of Davis and that the mature trees on the Project Site

18 provide suitable nesting habitat for this species. It also acknowledges that the Project would
19 have significant impacts on Swainson's hawks because it would result in the direct loss of
20| potential nesting habitat. However, Respondent fails to mitigate for the loss of the suitable
21 nesting habitat and therefore fails to mitigate the impact to insignificance. Feasible mitigation
22 includes for example dedicating off-site replacement habitat or replacing mature trees off-site.
23 Therefore, the Project did not mitigate this significant impact despite feasible mitigation being

24 available.

25 4 Recirculation. Respondent failed to recirculate the EIR to address
26 significant new information. CEQA requires that a lead agency must recirculate an EIR when

27 "significant new information" is added to the EIR after public review but prior to certification
28 of the EIR. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15088.5.) New information is considered "significant" if the

SOLURI 15 MESERVE
A LAW Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate CORPORATION

1 information is necessary to provide the public and interested agencies with "meaningful
2 opportunity to comment upon a substantial adverse environmental effect of the project or . ..
3 feasible project alternative[s] . . . ." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15088.5, subd. (a).) Significant new

4 information includes "a disclosure showing .. [a] significant environmental impact would
5 result from the project" or . . . [t]he draft EIR was so fundamentally and basically inadequate

6 and conclusory in nature that meaningful public review and comment were precluded." (CEQA
7 Guidelines, § 15088.5, subds. (a)(1) and (4).) Respondent is required to recirculate the EIR

8 because the Final EIR introduced significant new information.

9 i. The Final EIR introduced new information concerning hazardous
10 materials that demonstrates the potential for significant impacts on future residents that were
11 not disclosed in the Draft EIR. This new information showed the potential impacts from
12 hazardous materials were actually considerably higher than reported in the Draft EIR and that
13 the Phase 1 relied on in the Draft EIR was flawed and misleading. This evidence of a
14 significant new impact required recirculation pursuant to Public Resources Code section
15 21092.1 and CEQA Guidelines section 15088.5, subdivision (a)(1).

16 ii. This new information also demonstrates that the Draft EIR was

17 inadequate and precluded meaningful public review, which required recirculation under CEQA
18 Guidelines section 15088.5, subdivision (a)(4).

19 iii. Because there is feasible mitigation for the impact, but Respondent
20 declined to consider or adopt it, recirculation is also required under CEQA Guidelines section
21 15088.5, subdivision (a)(3).

22 g. Findings. Respondent failed to adopt legally adequate findings, supported
23 by substantial evidence, before approving the Project. As a result of the inadequacies in the
24 environmental analysis identified above, the findings adopted by Respondent are not supported
25 by substantial evidence as required by CEQA. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21002, 21002.1,
26 21081; CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15091, 15092, 15093).
27 h. As result of the foregoing defects, Respondent prejudicially abused its
28 discretion by approving the Project in a manner that does not comply with the requirements of

SOLURI

CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 CEQA and Petitioner is entitled to issuance of a writ of mandate setting aside all Entitlements

3 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

4 Violations of State Planning and Zoning Law

5 (Government Code, § 65000 et seq.)

6 64. Petitioner hereby re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding
7 paragraphs 1 through 63, inclusive, in their entirety, as if fully set forth herein.

8 65. The City's General Plan is the constitution for all future development, and any
9 decision affecting land use and development must be consistent with it.

10 66. The Gateway / Olive Drive Specific Plan functions as the General Plan, Specific

11 Plan, and zoning for the Project Site.

12 67. Actions inconsistent with the General Plan or the Specific Plan are void ab initio.

13 68. Respondent analyzed consistency with the General Plan and Specific Plan, but
14 omitted analysis where the Project was inconsistent with applicable policies and objectives. For
15 example, the Project is inconsistent with the Specific Plan's requirement to maintain historic

16 cottage character. The Project is also inconsistent with the General Plan's Noise Element

17 because indoor noise levels would exceed standards, and Respondent did not demonstrate that

18 the mitigation proposed would feasibly reduce impacts below significance. Similarly, outdoor
19 noise levels would exceed applicable standards at residential units nearest the Union Pacific

20 Railroad and those impacts have not been mitigated.
21 69. The City approved Project Entitlements that depend on General Plan consistency,

22 and approved the General Plan amendment and Specific Plan amendment that depend on

23 internal consistency.

24 70. By approving the Project's Entitlements and other approvals that depend on

25 General Plan consistency without an adequate analysis, and without considering the material
26 mandatory conflicts, the City acted arbitrarily, capriciously, and without evidentiary support.

1 71. For the foregoing reasons, Respondent has failed to proceed in accordance with

4 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

5 WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests the following relief and entry of
6 judgment as follows:

7 1. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondent to:

8 (a) vacate and set aside its CEQA exemption determination and approval of
9 the Entitlements for the Project on the grounds that the Project is not exempt from CEQA;
10 (b) vacate and set aside its certification of the Final EIR and approval of the

12 those actions;

13 (c) comply with CEQA and the State CEQA Guidelines in any subsequent
14 action taken to consider approval of the Project; and
15 (d) vacate and set aside the General Plan Amendment, Specific Plan

RE: Notice of Commencement of Action against City of Davis

Dear Ms. Mirabile:

Please take notice, under Public Resources Code section 21167.5, that Petitioner Susan Rainier intends to file a Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate (the "Petition")
under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act., Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"), against the City of Davis ("City"). The Petition challenges Respondent's March 13, 2018 decisions, and all subsequent actions, in approving: a General Plan amendment; Gateway / Olive Drive Specific Plan amendment; development agreement; affordable housing plan; lot merger; and other associated entitlements purporting to authorize the Lincoln40 development project, which includes a 249,788 square-foot multi-family residential building, parking areas, and various
amenities (the "Project"). The lawsuit will be based on violations of CEQA and other claims, as discussed more fully in the Project's administrative and environmental review proceedings. The exact nature of the allegations and relief sought is described in the
Petition that Petitioner plans to file on April 12, 2018.

Very truly yours,
