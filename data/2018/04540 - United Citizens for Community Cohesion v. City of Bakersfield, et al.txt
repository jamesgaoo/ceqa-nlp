FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Petitioner, UNITED CITIZENS FOR COMMUNITY COHESION ("Petitioner"),
2  alleges:
3 1. The Project is the "24th Street Improvement Project." The City of Bakersfield
4| ("City") certified the Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR") for the Project on June 8,
5 2016. The Project is a joint project by the California Department of Transportation ("Caltrans")

6 and the City and is subject to both state and federal environmental review requirements. The
7 Project is one of the projects included as part of the Thomas Roads Improvement Program
8 ("TRIP"). Caltrans, as assigned by the Federal Highway Administration, and in cooperation with
9 the City, proposes to widen roadways and alter the intersection on State Route 58 west of State
10 Route 99, and on State Route 178 east of State Route 99 in the City. This stretch of highway is

§ 11 collectively referred to as 24th Street. In addition to proposed alterations along 24th Street and a
-1706 eedo e eog 1 0 PE HBIRA OZ 8 Aueseg 12 I portion of 23rd Street, a northbound auxiliary lane along State Route 99 south of 24th Street is
13 planned. The area of the Project extends from southbound State Route 99/State Route 58,
14 through a residential neighborhood leading to a business district to just east of M Street linking
15 to State Route 178. In July of 2011, 24th Street was relinquished to the City and the limits of the
16 relinquishment are from the west end of the Kern River Bridge to just east of M Street.
17 2. Petitioner, United Citizens for Community Cohesion ("Petitioner"), is a California
18 mutual benefit corporation whose purpose is to promote the social welfare and environment in
19 the City of Bakersfield. Petitioner and its respective members a have a direct and substantial
20 beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondent complies with laws relating to environmental
21 protection. Petitioner and its respective members are adversely affected by Respondents' failure
22 to comply with CEQA in approving the Project. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims
23 raised in this Petition because Petitioner and its members' aesthetic and environmental interests

24 are directly and adversely affected by Respondent's' approval of the Project.
25 3. Respondent, City of Bakersfield ("Respondent"), is charter city incorporated
26  under the laws of the State of California. The City is the lead agency under the California
27 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA").

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 4. Real Party in Interest, California Department of Transportation ("Caltrans"), is a
2 public and state agency within the State of California, with its headquarters in Sacramento,
3 California. Caltrans is the lead agency for the Project under the National Environmental Policy
4 Act ("NEPA"). Caltrans obtained federal funding from the Federal Highway Administration

5 ("FHWA") and is the lead federal agency for the Project under NEPA based on the delegation of

7 environmental review, consultation, and any other actions required in accordance with applicable 6 authority to Caltrans by FHWA. Pursuant to 23 U.S. Code 327, Caltrans carried out the

Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Real Parties sued herein 8 federal laws on behalf of the FHWA.

10 as DOES 1-25, inclusive, and therefore sues these Real Parties by such fictitious names. 5.

11 Petitioner will amend this Petition to allege the true names and capacities of fictitiously named § d11 'dnoJ9 MET |euuBuO LIZ06 12 Real Parties in Interest. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that each
8 ezins "paia eulysjm ooZg 13 Respondent designated herein as a DOE has some responsibility for the events and happenings
'SIlH Auerag 14 alleged in this Petition.

16 Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Assessment. Respondent received comments from 15 6. In May of 2012, Respondent released for public review and comment a Draft

18 Assessment. The DEIR maintained the existence of the crosswalks at Alder/A Streets and 17 the public and public agencies regarding the Draft Environmental Impact Report/Environmental

19 Drake/D Streets (collectively the "Crosswalks") as part of the Project. Thereafter, in February of
20 2014 Respondent certified a Final Environmental Impact Report ("FEIR") for the Project but
21 eliminated the Alder/A Streets crosswalk from the Project approval. The FEIR was challenged in
22 Kern County Superior Court (Case No. S-1500-CV-281556) for non-compliance with the
23 California Environmental Quality Act. The Court granted the Petition for Writ of Mandate and
24 ordered Respondent to set aside the FEIR and project approvals.

26 Draft Environmental Impact Report (RDEIR). Respondent received comments from the public 25 7. In response to the writ issued by the Court, Respondent issued a Recirculated

27 and public agencies regarding the RDEIR. On June 8, 2016, Respondent certified the new FEIR

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 for the Project but did not remove the Alder/A Streets crosswalk from the Project. The new FÈIR

2 was again challenged in Kern Court Superior Court but the writ was ultimately discharged. The
3  legality of the new FEIR is the subject of a pending appeal in the Fifth District Court of Appeal.

4 8. While the CEQA appeal has been pending, City staff, along with the City's design
5 consultant, TYLin International ("TYLin"), have been working to refine the designs for the
6 Project, including the Crosswalks.
7 9. On October 11, 2017, the City conducted a public hearing to consider removal of
8 the crosswalks at Alder/A Street and Drake/D Street. Pursuant to Section 21950.5 of the
9 | California Vehicle Code, the City was required to give the public an opportunity to provide

10 comment on the proposed crosswalk removals. City staff and their design consultant TYLin
11 International (TYLin") expressed concerns regarding the safety of the crosswalks. TYLin § - I706 8 dee  ey aee g Aueseg eyns "pAa JJySI!M 00Z8 12 refused to sign the design plans for the Alder/A Streets crosswalk as the engineer of record
13 primarily because of the crosswalk's location. City staff recommended that the City Council
14 remove both crosswalks.
15 10. The City Council unanimously voted to "approve staff's recommendation" to
16 remove both crosswalks and to "direct[] staff to bring back design plans for council's approval,

17 that reflects a replacement crosswalk as close as possible to A Street and Alder Street between
18 north and south 24th Street so that the history of safe crossing is preserved." However, the did not
19 City conduct any additional environmental review for the Project before taking their vote on
20 October 11, 2017.
21 11. The new FEIR conducted for the Project states that the crosswalks are a
22 "neighborhood unifying element" that will ensure that there will be no further impacts on
23 "community cohesion." The City stated in the new FEIR that the two neighborhoods on either
24 side of 24th Street were "highly cohesive communities." The City also stated in the new FEIR
25 that maintenance of the crosswalks would ensure that there were no impacts on pedestrian
26 facilities and/or bicycle access. Also, the City stated in the new EIR that maintaining the
27 crosswalks would ensure that there would be no significant impacts on public services. The City
28

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 acknowledged that many residents continued to use the crosswalks to access public schools, bus
2 stops, hospitals, churches, libraries, public facilities, commercial and retail uses and other

3 existing land uses in the area. The City also stated that the crosswalks were needed to safely

6 the crosswalks which occurred on or about October 11, 2017.

8 November 13, 2017, the City Council conducted a public hearing to consider a replacement 7 13. After Petitioner brought suit against the City for non-compliance with CEQA on

crosswalk located at Pine Street at 24th Street. The City prepared an addendum for the Project.
10 Petitioner objected to the use of an Addendum as the appropriate environmental clearance 9

11 document and submitted a lengthy page objection letter. A true and correct copy of the letter 8 d17 Group, L1Z06 ens "pAg euJysI!M 0OZ8 12 submitted by Petitioner is attached as Exhibit D. Petitioner urged the City to conduct a

8 Subsequent EIR noting such a review was required to address both: (1) the decision to remove
anm dog Beverly 14| Alder/A Street and Drake/D Street crosswalks from the proposed project, and (2) the decision to 13

15 replace these two crosswalks with a new crosswalk at Pine Street. Petitioner further maintained
16 that the City was engaged in "project splitting" in order to try to justify use of an Addendum.
17 Finally, Petitioner explained to the City that the belated preparation of an Addendum did not
18 solve the non-compliance with CEQA - which requires preparation of an environmental
19 clearance document before any action is taken on a project. The City did not rescind its prior
20 resolution to remove the crosswalks on October 11, 2017.
21 14. This action arises under CEQA and its implementing regulations, which are

23 local agencies when undertaking projects subject to CEQA. (Pub. Resources Code§ 21000 et 22 prescribed by the Secretary of the California Resources Agency to be followed by all state and

24 seq.; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15000 et seq.) This Court has jurisdiction over the matters
25 alleged in this Petition pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, and Public Resources
26 Code section 21168.5. In the alternative, this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil
27 Procedure section 1094.5 and Public Resources Code section 21168.

9 Petition.

a 10 18. CEQA Guidelines Section 15164 is entitled "Addendum to an EIR or Negative
11 Declaration." This section of the Guidelines states as follows: "(a) The lead agency or § d77 Group, MET juueyo •LZ06 euns "pAIa BJJySIIM 0OZ8 12 responsible agency shall prepare an addendum to a previously certified EIR if some changes or
13 8 additions are necessary but none of the conditions described in Section 15162 calling for

15 declaration may be prepared if only minor technical changes or additions are necessary or none
16 of the conditions described in Section 15162 calling for the preparation of a subsequent EIR or
17 negative declaration have occurred. (c) An addendum need not be circulated for public review
18 but can be included in or attached to the final EIR or adopted negative declaration. (d) The
19 decision-making body shall consider the addendum with the final EIR or adopted negative
20 declaration prior to making a decision on the project. (e) A brief explanation of the decision not
21 to prepare a subsequent EIR pursuant to Section 15162 should be included in an addendum to an
22 EIR, the lead agency's required findings on the project, or elsewhere in the record. The
23 explanation must be supported by substantial evidence."
24 19. CEQA Guidelines Section 15162 is entitled "Subsequent EIRs and Negative
25 Declarations." This section of the Guidelines requires a Subsequent EIR to be conducted when

importance, which was not known and could not have been known with the exercise of

8 Declaration was adopted, shows any of the following: (A) The project will have one or more

10  effects previously examined will be substantially more severe than shown in the previous EIR; 9 significant effects not discussed in the previous EIR or negative declaration; (B) Significant

alternatives previously found not to be feasible would in fact be 11 (C) Mitigation measures or § d11'dnoJg MET jeuueuo LIZ06 eyns "pALE BJJySIIM 0OZ8 12 feasible, and would substantially reduce one or more significant effects of the project, but the

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 of the relocated crosswalk on November 13, 2017 did not eliminate the legal failings of the City.
A Subsequent EIR was required for the Project to address both: (1) the decision to remove

3 Alder/A Street and Drake/D Street crosswalks from the proposed project, and (2) the decision to
4 replace these two crosswalks with a new crosswalk at Pine Street. Further, the City engaged in

5 "project splitting" in an effort to justify use of an Addendum. In any event, CEQA required
6 preparation of an environmental clearance document before any action is taken on a project. The
7 City did not rescind its prior resolution authorizing the removal the crosswalks on October 11,
8 2017. Therefore, the City failed to comply with CEQA.
9 23. Respondent therefore committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to

10 proceed in a manner required by law by failing to utilize the applicable environmental clearance

§ 11 document under CEQA and failed to conduct the required environmental analysis before

Dear City Clerk:
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under California Public Resources Code section 21167.5, that Petitioner, United Citizens for Community Cohesion, Inc. ("Petitioner"), intends to immediately file a Petition for Writ of Mandate ("Petition") under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") against the City of Bakersfield ("City'). Petitioner contends that the City inappropriately prepared an Addendum to the Final EIR for the 24th Street widening project ("Project') on or about December 13, 2017 in an effort to avoid the requisite public review and comment required for a Subsequent or Supplemental Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the 24th Street widening project.
Petitioner contends that a subsequent EIR is required to address both: (1) the decision to remove Alder/A Street and Drake/D Street crosswalks from the proposed project, and (2) the decision to replace these two crosswalks with a new crosswalk at Pine Street. Petitioner contends that the City has engaged in project splitting in order to try to justify use of an Addendum. The Petition will be filed in Kern County Superior Court and will allege, inter alia, that the City failed to comply with CEQA. The Petition will request that the court direct the City to vacate and rescind the project approvals and to comply with CEQA. Also, the Petition will seek Petitioners' cost and attorneys' fees.

Re: Challenge to Approval of Removal of Crosswalks as Part of 24th Street Widening Project in the City of Bakersfield; United Citizens for Community Cohesion v. City of Bakersfield et al.
Honorable Attorney General Becerra:

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under Public Resources Code §21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure Section §388, that on November 13, 2017, United Citizens for Community Cohesion, a California mutual benefit corporation, filed a petition for writ of mandate against the City of Bakersfield ("Respondent") and California Department of Transportation ("Real Party in Interest") in the Kern County Superior Court. The petition alleges that the City of Bakersfield ("City") violated the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") by failing to conduct the

Subject: Comments December 13, 2017 Agenda Item 10a - Public Hearing Proposed Pedestrian Crossing of 24th Street at Pine Street - Need For
Appropriate Environmental Review of Changes to the 24th Street Widening Project.

Dear Members of the City Council:

The City has inappropriately prepared an Addendum to the Final EIR for the 24th Street widening project in an apparent effort to avoid the requisite public review and comment required for a Subsequent or Supplemental Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the 24th Street widening project. A Subsequent EIR is required to address both: (1) the decision to remove Alder/A Street and Drake/D Street crosswalks from the proposed
project, and (2) the decision to replace these two crosswalks with a new crosswalk at
Pine Street. Not only has the City prepared the wrong environmental document to
address new information indicating that the project as proposed and approved is unsafe, it has engaged in project splitting in order to try to justify use of an Addendum.

1. When Is An Addendum Appropriate

As noted in CEQA Guidelines Section 15164, use of an Addendum is allowable when (emphasis added):

15164. ADDENDUM TO AN EIR OR NEGATIVE DECLARATION
(a) The lead agency or responsible agency shall prepare an

addendum to a previously certified EIR if some changes or additions are necessary but none of the conditions described in Section 15162 calling for preparation of a subsequent EIR have
occurred.
(c) An addendum need not be circulated for public review but can be included in or attached to the final EIR or adopted negative
declaration.
(d) The decision making body shall consider the addendum with the final EIR or adopted negative declaration prior to making a decision
on the project. (e) A brief explanation of the decision not to prepare a subsequent EIR pursuant to Section 15162 should be included in an addendum to an EIR, the lead agency's findings on the project, or elsewhere in the record. The explanation must be supported by substantial
evidence.

2. An Addendum Is Not Appropriate To Address The Unsafe Crosswalks
In this case the City has ignored the fact that one or more of the conditions described in Section 15162 calling for preparation of a subsequent EIR have occurred. CEQA
Guidelines Section 15164 states (emphasis added);'

15162. SUBSEQUENT EIRS AND NEGATIVE DECLARATIONS
(a) When an EIR has been certified or a negative declaration adopted for a project, no subsequent EIR shall be prepared for that project unless the lead agency determines, on the basis of substantial evidence in the light of the whole record, one or more of
the following: (1) Substantial changes are proposed in the project which will require major revisions of the previous EIR or negative declaration due to the involvement of new significant environmental effects or a
substantial increase in the severity of previously identified
significant effects; (2) Substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which the project is undertaken which will require major revisions of the previous EIR or Negative Declaration due to the
involvement of new significant environmental effects or a
substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant effects; or (3) New information of substantial importance, which was not known and could not have been known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time the previous EIR was certified as complete or the Negative Declaration was adopted, shows any of the following: (A) The project will have one or more significant effects not
The City misquotes CEQA Guidelines Section 15162 on pages 1 and 3 of the
Addendum.

2

discussed in the previous EIR or negative declaration; (B) Significant effects previously examined will be substantially more severe than shown in the previous EIR;
(C) Mitigation measures or alternatives previously found not to be feasible would in fact be feasible, and would substantially reduce
one or more significant effects of the project, but the project
proponents decline to adopt the mitigation measure or alternative;
or
(D) Mitigation measures or alternatives which are considerably different from those analyzed in the previous EIR would substantially reduce one or more significant effects on the environment, but the project proponents decline to adopt the
mitigation measure or alternative. (d) A subsequent EIR or subsequent negative declaration shall be given the same notice and public review as required under Section 15087 or Section 15072. A subsequent EIR or negative declaration shall state where the previous document is available and can be
reviewed.

2.1 This Is New Information of Substantial Importance Of Significant Effects Not Discussed In the FEIR

In this case, the new information that has come to light is the fact that the project as designed is so unsafe that the project designer, TYLin will not sign the project plans. As explained on page 2 of the Addendum:

During development of final designs for the Project, the City's design consultant, TYLin International (TYLin), determined that maintaining the Alder/A Streets crosswalk at its current location as a part of the Project would be unsafe, for the following reasons:

1. While traveling westbound on 24th Street, there would not be sufficient distance for drivers to stop their vehicles prior to the crosswalk after navigating through complex roadway features, such as the merging of lanes and the geometry of the approaching
curve.

2. The effectiveness of the existing traffic control devices, including flashing yellow beacons, is limited on high-speed or high-volume arterial streets.

3. The widening of the roadway from 2 lanes to 3 lanes will increase traffic volumes and increase the time for pedestrians to
cross 24th Street

4. The merge between traffic on 24th Street and C Street would
occur too close to the crosswalk.

3

City staff also determined that the Drake/D Streets crosswalk was equally unsafe and should be removed for the following reasons:
1. This existing crosswalk is only striped and has no light or other
signage.
2. While traveling westbound on 24th Street, the crosswalk is located at the beginning of the merge from four lanes to three lanes. As with the Alder/A Streets crosswalk, this crosswalk creates multiple points of focus for drivers who will be forced to prepare for the merge while, at the same time, determining whether there is a pedestrian crossing the street.
3. Since 24th Street at Drake Streets will be four lanes, a
pedestrian in the crosswalk could be hidden from view while in the
middle two lanes.

4. A safer location for crossing exists at the signalized intersection at F Street, which is a much safer crosswalk for pedestrians and is
only 600 feet away.
The conditions described in CEQA Guidelines Section 15162(3)(A) are met by the discovery that the two crosswalk locations are unsafe. This is:
(3) New information of substantial importance, which was not known and could not have been known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time the previous EIR was certified
as complete or the Negative Declaration was adopted, shows
any of the following: (A) The project will have one or more significant effects not discussed in the previous EIR or negative declaration;

2.2 This New Information Of Substantial Importance Was Not Known At The Time The Previous EIR Was Certified
The City in the 24th Street Widening FEIR Volume 1 (page 329) found no impacts to pedestrian safety:4
Traffic and Transportation/Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities: The project provides beneficial impacts to traffic and transportation/pedestrian and bicycle facilities within the study area and therefore would not contribute to adverse cumulative impacts.
The City in its Findings certifying the FEIR for the 24th Street Widening Project found no pedestrian impacts:
See also FEIR Volume 1, page 339 where pedestrian issues are listed as less than significant.

4

f) Conflict with adopted policies, plans or programs regarding public transit, bicycle, or pedestrian facilities, or otherwise decrease the performance or safety of such facilities?
No Impact. The Project is identified in several adopted local and regional transportation planning documents as an important and necessary
component of the transportation system. It is consistent with the mobility goals and policies of Kern Council of Governments, Caltrans, and the City. The Project is also consistent with the City General Plan goals and policies to improve transportation corridors, provide adequate infrastructure, maintain efficient traffic operations on City streets, and work with Kern COG and Caltrans to improve the corridor. No impacts would
occur.

The City's Master Response 10 in Volume 2 of the FEIR, pages 60-67 for the 24th Street Widening Project says in part, at page 65 that the project as designed is safe for pedestrians:

Pedestrians typically cross arterials at intersections. Sometimes
pedestrian markings are painted on the road surface at midblock crossing locations. The project would result in an improved arterial roadway developed in compliance with city standards. Similar to the existing conditions on 24th Street, the improvements to 24th Street include intersection signalization, stop controls, painted pedestrian crosswalks, and other features to ensure that pedestrians can safely cross segments of 24th Street.

Furthermore, in Volume 3 of the FEIR at page 102 the City added the following language:

The following new paragraph is inserted after Paragraph 5 on page
61.
The project is consistent with overall goals for creating a pedestrian friendly environment in the residential neighborhood and compatible with the City's goal to encourage livability. New cul-de-sacs are compatible with adjacent residential land uses and zoning.
As noted on page 137 of Volume 3 of the FEIR:

2.1.5 Crosswalks
Some comments asked about the status of the crosswalks, made recommendations about their design or operation, or expressed concerns about their safety. Crosswalks were described as an element of the
project in Chapter 2 of Volume and addressed in responses to public comments in Volume 2 of the FEIR (refer to Master Response No. 10: Pedestrian and Bicycle Access and GP-24-5, GP-36-8, GP-52-1, GP-93-4, GP-95-1, GP-100-1, GP-111-11, GP-116-2, GP-140-2, GP-160-5, GP- 163-1, GP-182-1, GP-187-2, GP-193-14, GP-196-4, P-4-2, OC-7-1, OC-

5

13-1, OC-34-4, OC-46-1, OC-47-1). The issue of crosswalks was not
addressed in the R-DEIR.

The City thus received comments expressing concern regarding crosswalk safety during the environmental process that lead to the certification of the FEIR, but found the crosswalk design to be safe. The fact that the City has now discovered that the project as designed posses a safety hazard to pedestrians is thus new information of substantial importance, which shows the project, will have one or more significant effects not discussed in the previous EIR (i.e. FEIR).

2.3 This New Information Was Not Known With The Exercise Of Reasonable Diligence At The Time The Previous EIR Was Certified
The City did not discover the potential for impacts during the CEQA process for the proposed project, which included two court challenges to the document and the preparation of:3

As noted in the City's August 31, 2017 staff report, the City first learned of the potential safety issues regarding crosswalk placement during the design refinement, when TYLin expressed its concerns with the Alder/A Streets crosswalk as currently configured and TYLin indicated they would not sign the design plans for the crosswalk as the engineer of record primarily because of the crosswalk's location. This is laid out in the Resolution of the Bakersfield City Council Removing the 24th Street Crosswalks At Alder/A Streets and Drake/D Streets adopted August 31, 2017, which states:
WHEREAS, on June 8, 2016, Council certified the REIR and approved the Project but did not remove the Alder/A Streets crosswalk from the Project;
and

WHEREAS, since the Project was reapproved, City staff, along with the City's design consultant, TYLin International ("TYLin"), has been working to refine the designs for the Project, including the Crosswalks; and

See also process summary in the August 31, 2017 staff report for the removal of the two crosswalks and the Resolution of the Bakersfield City Council Removing the 24th Street Crosswalks At Alder/A Streets and Drake/D Streets.

6

WHEREAS, during the design refinement, TYLin expressed its concerns
with the Alder/A Streets crosswalk as currently configured and recommended that it be removed for the following reasons:

1. Going westbound on 24th Street, there is insufficient distance
between the merge from four lanes to three lanes after the couplet
to allow drivers to successfully navigate the merge and the potential of pedestrians in the crosswalk meaning that drivers will be focused on the road while they transition through the area and not on the upcoming crosswalk and drivers in the middle lanes may not have adequate sight distance to see a pedestrian;

2. The flashing yellow beacon and striping does not provide sufficient notice to drivers going either direction on 24th Street that a pedestrian is crossing the road;

3. The volume of traffic on 24th Street makes crossing 24th Street
at an Alder/A Streets crosswalk unsafe for pedestrians and
vehicular traffic alike; and

4. Additional traffic accesses 24th Street from the south at C Street,
close in proximity to the crosswalk; and
WHEREAS, although other designs for the Alder/A Streets crosswalk were proposed, TYLin refuses to sign the design plans for the Alder/A Streets crosswalk as the engineer of record primarily because of the crosswalk's location; and

WHEREAS, City staff has also expressed concerns with the Drake/D Street crosswalk and recommends that it be removed for the following
reasons:

1 . As defined in the Project, the crosswalk is only striped without any lights or other signage;

2. Going westbound on 24th Street, the crosswalk is located at the beginning of the merge from four lanes to three lanes, which creates multiple points of focus for drivers who will be forced to prepare for the merge while, at the same time, determining whether there is a pedestrian crossing the street;

3. Since 24th Street at Drake/D Streets will be four lanes, a pedestrian in the crosswalk could be shielded from traffic in the
middle two lanes; and

4. The mid-block crosswalk at Drake/D Streets is only 600 feet from
the crosswalk at the signalized intersection at F Street, which is a much safer crosswalk for pedestrians; and

7

WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 21950.5 of the California Vehicle Code, the City is required to give the public an opportunity to provide comment on the proposed removal of the Crosswalks, which it accomplished by placing notice of an October 11, 2017 public hearing at both Crosswalks inviting the public to provide comments on the proposed removal; and
WHEREAS, during the public hearing, the City Council considered all facts, testimony, and evidence concerning the removal of the Crosswalks.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Bakersfield City Council
as follows:

1. The above recitals are incorporated herein by this reference.
2. All required notices have been given. 3. The Crosswalks are hereby ordered to be removed.
The criterion for a Subsequent EIR contained in CEQA Guidelines Section 15162, has therefore been met. The Subsequent or Supplemental EIR must be circulated for public review and comment. The Subsequent or Supplement EIR must address both of the connected actions: (1) the decision to remove Alder/A Street and Drake/D Street crosswalks from the proposed project, and (2) the decision to replace these two crosswalks with a new crosswalk at Pine Street. The City cannot separate these connected actions in order to try to justify an Addendum for the new crosswalk portion of the actions.

3. The Required Subsequent EIR for the 24th Street Widening Project
It has now been shown that the project as proposed is unsafe. The EIR needs to be revised to indicate that the project as proposed is unsafe. The removal of the two crosswalks and their replacement with a new crosswalk at Pine Street is essentially mitigation, or a project alternative, to address a project impact that was not disclosed or identified in the FEIR, and should be identified and addressed in the Subsequent EIR for the project. The Subsequent EIR should include a more detailed examination of
potential crosswalk and intersection location impacts.

3.1 The Analysis Of Alternative Crosswalk Locations In The Addendum Is Inadequate And The Analysis of Traffic and Pedestrian Safety In The FEIR Is Inadequate And Must Be Augmented
The Subsequent EIR should identify the location of all proposed crosswalks included in the project as approved, and indicate whether they are signalized or unsignalized. Any unsignalized intersections, such as K Street, that will have crosswalks should receive a thorough safety analysis. The analysis should address both stopping sight distance and decision sight distance, as was done in the Addendum. The Subsequent EIR should explain why a decision sight distance of 800 feet (Addendum page 5) was selected (i.e. Avoidance Maneuver D), which is for suburban roads, rather than the Avoidance

Exhibit 3-3. Decision Sight Distance

Given the urban characteristics of 24th Street, it is unclear that the Pine Street crossing is safe as proposed.
The Subsequent EIR must also detail the criteria used to select the HAWK type of crossing and demonstrate consistency with AASHTO Guide for the Planning, Design, and Operation of Pedestrian Facilities guidance.
The analysis conducted should include current and projected traffic and pedestrian volumes and be consistent with the typical requirements for Caltrans Project Report, as specified in California's Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD):

Standard:
The Caltrans' District shall prepare a project report of the investigation of conditions at locations where a new traffic signal is to be installed, an existing traffic signal is to be modified or an existing traffic signal is to be removed on the State highway. Caltrans District Directors are authorized
to approve project reports in accordance with the current departmental
policies contained in the Project Development Procedures Manual. Three copies of the District approved project report shall be forwarded to Caltrans' Chief, State and Local Project Development. A project report

4 Exhibit 3-3. Decision Sight Distance. AASHTO Manual: A Policy on Geometric Design, Highways and Streets.

9

shall be prepared whether the work is performed by the State or by others, if the traffic signal is located on the State highway.

Guidance:

General requirements for project reports are noted in Caltrans' Project Development Procedures Manual. A project report for the installation, modification (except for upgrading projects involving specific equipment) or removal of a traffic signal should include the following specific
information:
1. Traffic Counts. a) Both pedestrian and vehicular traffic counts should include the periods of the average day when the signals would appear to be needed most. The counts should be at least eight hours in duration, not necessarily
consecutive, but including a.m. and p.m. peak hours. b) Traffic counts for a new signal shall be shown on appropriate Traffic Signal Warrant Sheets and a Directional Traffic Count Sheet. See Figures 4C-101(CA) thru 4C-103(CA). c) Where pedestrian volumes are significant, show the volume on each crosswalk for the same periods as the vehicle count.
d) When estimated traffic volumes are used in establishing traffic signal warrants, they should be prepared on Form TS-10D. See Figure 4C- 103(CA).
2. Collision Diagram. A collision diagram for the intersection covering the recent collision experience history. The diagram should cover a 3- year interval. 3. Condition Diagram. A condition diagram showing existing roadway conditions. Any railroad grade crossing within 200 feet of the intersection should be shown.
4. Improvement Diagram. A diagram showing existing and proposed signals, phasing, channelization and other proposed improvements. This may be combined with 1, 2 and/or
3 on a single plan.
5. Estimate.
An estimate of the cost of the project (including State furnished materials) and the proposed method of financing. 6. Other Specialized Data When Appropriate: a. Classification of Vehicles. The classification is required when it is a
significant factor in affecting intersection capacity. b. Critical Speed (85th percentile) of Approaching Vehicles. This is the speed at a point unaffected by existing controls. c. Time-Space Diagram. When the project involves a coordinated traffic signal system.

The investigation of the need for a traffic control signal shall include an

analysis of factors related to the existing operation and safety at the study location and the potential to improve these conditions, and the applicable factors contained in the following traffic signal warrants: Warrant 1, Eight-Hour Vehicular Volume Warrant 2, Four-Hour Vehicular Volume
Warrant 3, Peak Hour
Warrant 4, Pedestrian Volume Warrant 5, School Crossing Warrant 6, Coordinated Signal System Warrant 7, Crash Experience
Warrant 8, Roadway Network Warrant 9, Intersection Near a Grade Crossing®
Clearly the kind of detailed analysis needed to assess pedestrian safety was not included in the FEIR for the project, resulting in the failure to identify a significant impact, and the EIR needs to be augmented accordingly.
As noted in the AASHTO Manual A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and
Streets (page 99):

Reducing Pedestrian-Vehicular Conflicts

When designing urban highways with substantial pedestrian-vehicular conflicts, the following are some measures that could be considered to help reduce these conflicts and may increase the efficient operation of the roadway: (1) eliminate left and/or right turns, (2) probibit free-flow right-turn movements, (3) prohibit right turn on red, (4) convert from two-way to one- way street operation, (5) provide separate signal phases for pedestrians, (6) eliminate selected crosswalks, and (T) provide for pedestrian grade separations. These and other pedestrian considerations are detailed in subsequent chapters and in the AASHTO Guide for the Planning, Design, and Operation of Pedestrian Facilities (25).

The Subsequent EIR should examine whether more than one crosswalk is needed to provide connectivity between the neighborhoods on either side of 24th Street, between Oak Street and F Street. As noted by the National Association of City Transportation Officials:

On streets with higher volume (>3000 ADT), higher speeds (>20 mph), or more lanes (2+), crosswalks should be the norm at intersections. Designers should take into account both existing as well as projected crossing demand. Frequent crossings reinforce walkability and have the
potential to fuel greater demand. Where signalized or stop-controlled
pedestrian crossings are not warranted but demand exists or is
anticipated, designers should continue to work toward goals of safety and comfort for people walking through other means, such as actuated crossings or enhanced crossing treatments. ..

California MUTCD 2014 Addition, page 828 https://nacto.org/publication/urban-street-design-guide/intersection-design- elements/crosswalks-and-crossings/

11

Application of the Pedestrian Volume Warrant (MUTCD 4C.05) should be considered alongside multiple factors, including future land uses, projected pedestrian volumes, and built environment factors. Minimum spacing criteria of 300 feet may not be adequate in all cases and should be evaluated on the basis of the pre existing street network as well as
foreseen crossing demand. ..
The practice of discouraging pedestrian crossings by leaving uncontrolled crossings unmarked is not a valid safety measure. Instead, it encourages unsafe, risk-taking behavior and discourages walking citywide. Efforts should be made to enhance or highlight desired crossings wherever practicable. Hybrid beacons, rapid flash beacons, raised crossings, medians, and other safety counter measures may be suitable and less expensive than full signalization. These should all be considered before leaving an uncontrolled crossing unmarked. ..
Crosswalk spacing criteria should be determined according to the pedestrian network, built environment, and observed desire lines. In general, if it takes a person more than 3 minutes to walk to a crosswalk, wait to cross the street, and then resume his or her journey, he or she may
decide to cross along a more direct, but unsafe or unprotected, route. While this behavior depends heavily on the speed and volume of motorists, it is imperative to understand crossing behaviors from a
pedestrian's perspective.
The mid-distance point between the Oak Street and proposed Pine Street Crosswalk is approximately 1,006 feet to the nearest crosswalk; and the mid-point is approximately 1,214 feet between Pine and F Streets.
measurements of distances). (See Attachment 1 for Google Earth

Average pedestrian walking speeds range from approximately 0.8 to 1.8 m/s [2.5 to 6.0 ft/sec]. The Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) uses a normal walking speed of 1.2 m/s [4.0 ft/s]. Older people will generally walk at speeds in the lower end of this range.®
This equates to walking times of approximately 4.2 minutes and 5 minutes respectively, from the mid-point between crosswalks, exclusive of crosswalk wait time. This may be too far from a safety and community connectivity standpoint, given the increased traffic on 24th Street with the project. Based on AASHTO Walking Speeds and the National Association of City Transportation Officials guidance, pedestrians should be no further than (3 X 60 seconds x 4 ft/sec) or a maximum of 720 feet from a crosswalk, if crosswalks wait times are zero; closer with wait times considered. The authors of the Addendum (at page 6) appear to know this, focusing in their description of the new crosswalk at Pine Street on the increased distance pedestrians would have to walk, rather than the total distance, and thus deceptively stating that:

& AASHTO, page 97 - Walking Speeds.

12

Staff, therefore, proposes the construction of a new pedestrian crossing at the intersection of Pine Street and 24th Street. This crosswalk would be located 700 feet to the west of A Street. The proposed Pine Street crossing would combine with the existing crosswalk at Oak Street to the
west and the existing crosswalk at F Street to the east to provide available pedestrian crossings at three locations within or in the vicinity of Segment 3. While some pedestrians crossing 24" Street would have an increased
distance to get to the nearest crosswalk, such as those currently located close to Alder/A Streets or Drake/D Streets, no pedestrians would have to walk more than an additional 700 feet (two blocks) to reach the nearest crosswalk.

The Subsequent EIR should also address the location of crosswalks in relation to school access, bus stops, and bike paths/lanes.

3.2 The Subsequent EIR Needs to Re-Examine The Project and Alternatives In Light of the New Information

The City and the FEIR for the 24th Street Project screened out Alternative I due to safety concerns.9 It has now been revealed that the project as approved is not safe. The Subsequent FEIR needs to reexamine the analysis of both the project and the alternatives when it comes to safety and rectify the inappropriate screening out of Alternative I.

The following table summarizes the approved project's ability to meet the project objectives. The City has approved a project that fails to meet most of the project objectives.

RESULTING CONCLUSION: Alternative meets only two

/1/ Objectives are from pages 26-28 of the RDEIR of the project objectives.

The proposed project would result in an increase in capacity on 24th Street consistent with Objective 1 . However, the proposed Project does not meet Objective #1a, since 16

14

of the 34 study intersections will operate at LOS D or worse in 2035 with the proposed Project according to Table 2.9 of the 2013 FEIR/2015 DEIR; according to the Summary Table of the Traffic Analysis11 for the proposed project, 22 of the 39 study intersections will operate at LOS D or worse in 2035 with the proposed Project.
When screening Alternative I - Restriping, the RDEIR used alleged failure to achieve one of the objectives, Objective 1b the public safety objective, as an alternative-killer. When screening Alternative J Hageman Flyover, the RDEIR uses alleged failure to fully achieve one or two of the objectives, as an alternative-killer. If this same threshold were applied to the adopted Project, it would be screen-out, it since it fails to meet most of the project objectives. The Alternatives in the Subsequent EIR should reflect this information.

3.3 The City Must Rescind Its Action On The Crosswalks Until the Subsequent EIR Is Prepared

CEQA requires analysis of the whole of an action. It is not acceptable to break a project into pieces for purposes of limiting environmental analysis. The City inappropriately acted to remove the two crosswalks from the project design, without conducting any environmental review, despite the fact that the City received a comment from a member of the public on the need for additional environmental review.12

4. Conclusion

The City needs to prepare a Subsequent or Supplemental EIR to address the combined actions of removing and replacing project crosswalks. In addition, the City needs to
provide a more detailed analysis of safety issues regarding project design, now that it
has been revealed that the project as approved is unsafe.

Sincerely,
