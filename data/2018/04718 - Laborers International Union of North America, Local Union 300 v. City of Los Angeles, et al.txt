26 Civil Procedure §388, that on November 30, 2018, Laborers International Union of North

1 COUNCIL; LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF CITY PLANNING; and LOS ANGELES
2 CITY PLANNING COMMISSION (*Respondents"), and Real Party in Interest CP V 520
3 MATEO, LLC ("Real Party").

4 The Petition alleges that Respondents approved Real Party in Interest's proposal to
5 construction of a 13-story, 150-foot high mixed use live/work development containing up to 600

6 live/work units and 60,000 square feet of office, restaurant, retail, and cultural space (the

7 "Project"), despite the presence of highly toxic chemicals on the Project site, which could pose a

8 risk to construction workers and others. Respondents approved the Project even though the
9 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") and Statement of Overriding Considerations (which is
10 necessary because Respondents concede there will be significant environmental effects that will
11 not be fully mitigated) violate the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public
12 Resources Code ("PRC") §21000, et seq., including the CEQA Guidelines, 14 California Code of
13 Regulations ("CCR") §15000, et seq. The EIR does not comply with CEQA, including by failing
14 to analyze properly the known toxic chemicals present on the Project site and deferring
15 development of mitigation measures to deal with those chemicals, analyzing air quality using
16 erroneous assumptions that understate the effects and failing to adopt feasible mitigation
17 measures, failing to analyze health risks at all, incorrectly finding greenhouse gas emissions less
18 than significant and failing to adopt feasible mitigation measures, and inaccurately describing
19 existing traffic conditions and understating the Project's effects on traffic. Respondents also
20 violated CEQA by making inadequate findings in adopting the Statement of Overriding
21 Considerations. A copy of the Petition is attached to this Notice.

3  ("Petitioner" or "Local 300") petitions this Court on its own behalf, on behalf of its members, on
4 behalf of the general public, and in the public interest pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure

5 §1094.5 and Public Resources Code §21168, or, in the alternative, pursuant to Code of Civil
6 (Procedure §1085 and Public Resources Code §21168.5, for a writ of mandate directed to
7 Respondents City of Los Angeles, Los Angeles City Council, Los Angeles Department of City
8 Planning, and Los Angeles City Planning Commission ("Respondents" or "City"), and Real Party
9 in Interest CP V 520 Mateo, LLC ("Real Party").
10 2. This action challenges Respondents' approval of the construction of a 13-story,
11 150-foot high mixed use live/work development containing up to 600 live/work units and 60,000
12 square feet of office, restaurant, retail, and cultural space (the "Project"). Highly toxic chemicals
13 are present on the Project site, which could pose a risk to construction workers and others.
14 3. Respondents approved the Project even though the Environmental Impact Report
15 ("EIR") and Statement of Overriding Considerations (which is necessary because Respondents
16 concede there will be significant environmental effects that will not be fully mitigated) violate the
17 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code ("PRC") §21000, et
18 lseq., including the CEQA Guidelines, 14 California Code of Regulations ("CCR") §15000, et
19 Ilseq.
20 4. The EIR does not comply with CEQA, including by failing to analyze properly the
21 known toxic chemicals present on the Project site and deferring development of mitigation

22 measures to deal with those chemicals, analyzing air quality using erroneous assumptions that
23 understate the effects and failing to adopt feasible mitigation measures, failing to analyze health
24 risks at all, incorrectly finding greenhouse gas emissions less than significant and failing to adopt
25 feasible mitigation measures, and inaccurately describing existing traffic conditions and
26| understating the Project's effects on traffic.
! 27 5. Respondents also violated CEQA by making inadequate findings in adopting the
28 Statement of Overriding Considerations.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE*

6, Respondents did not do what they should have with respect to important
environmental concerns. Accordingly, Respondents' certification of the EIR, adoption of the
Statement of Overriding Considerations, and approval of the Project should be set aside.

PARTIES

5 7. Petitioner Laborers International Union of North America, Local Union 300, is a
6 labor organization representing thousands of employees who are residents of the City and County

7 of Los Angeles. Local 300's purposes include advocating on behalf of its members to ensure safe
8 workplace environments; working to protect recreational opportunities for its members to

10 healthful, productive, and aesthetically and culturally pleasing surroundings on and off the job;
11 /promoting environmentally sustainable businesses and development projects on behalf of its
12 members, including providing comments raising environmental concerns and benefits on
13  proposed development projects; advocating for changes to proposed development projects that
14 will help to achieve a balance between employment, the human population, and resource use to
15 permit high standards of living and a wide sharing of life's amenities by its members as well as
16 the general public; advocating for steps to preserve important historic, cultural, and natural
17 aspects of our national heritage, and to maintain, wherever possible, an environment that supports
18 diversity and variety of individual choice; advocating on behalf of its members for programs,
19 policies, and development projects that promote not only good jobs but also a healthy natural
20 environment and working environment, including advocating for changes to proposed projects
21 and policies that, if adopted, would reduce air, soil, and water pollution, minimize harm to
22 wildlife, conserve wild places, reduce traffic congestion, reduce global warming impacts, and
23 assure compliance with applicable land use ordinances; and working to attain the widest range of
24 . beneficial uses of the environment without degradation, risk to health or safety, or other
25  undesirable or unintended consequences.

26 8. Respondent City of Los Angeles is a municipal corporation in whose jurisdiction

27 the Project will be located.

28

3..
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 9. Respondent Los Angeles City Council ("City Council") serves as the legislative
2 body of the City of Los Angeles for the planning and provision of services related to public needs
3 and the requirements of state laws. As the elected representatives of the people of the City of Los
4 Angeles, the members of the City Council establish overall City priorities and set policy.
5 Respondent City Council is the governing body of the City, and is ultimately responsible for
6 reviewing and approving or denying the Project. The City Council voted on October 31, 2018, to
7 approve the Project, including to certify the EIR and adopt a Statement of Overriding
8 Considerations.

10. Respondent Los Angeles Department of City Planning is the "lead agency" for the
10 Project for purposes of Public Resources Code §21067, and has principal responsibility for
11| conducting environmental review for the Project and taking other actions necessary to comply
12 with CEQA.

13 11. Respondent Los Angeles City Planning Commission ("Planning Commission") is
14 a commission of the City of Los Angeles. Planning Commission members are appointed by the
15 Mayor, subject to confirmation by the City Council. The Planning Commission voted on June
16 14, 2018, to approve the Project, including certifying the EIR.

17 12. Real Party in Interes CP V 520 Mateo, LLC, is the Project applicant and recipient
18 of the approvals granted as part of the Project.

19 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

20 13. Pursuant to either California Code of Civil Procedure ("CCP") §1094.5 and Public
21| Resources Code §21168 or California Code of Civil Procedure §1085 and Public Resources Code
22 §21168.5, this Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandate to set aside Respondents' •
23 decisions to certify the EIR, adopt the Statement of Overriding Considerations, and approve the
24 Project.

25 14. Venue is proper in this Court under California Code of Civil Procedure §§394
26 (actions against a city, county, or local agency) and 395 (actions generally) because Respondents
27 include a city and local agency based in the County of Los Angeles and because the cause of

28

4
VERIFIED PETITIÓN FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- action alleged in this Petition arose in the County of Los Angeles and the Project will occur
2 within the County of Los Angeles.

3 STANDING

4 15. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims alleged in this Petition because it is
5 beneficially interested in this matter, as required by Code of Civil Procedure §1086. Petitioner
6 a has a direct and beneficial interest in Respondents' compliance with laws bearing upon approval
7 of the Project. These interests will be directly and adversely affected by the Project, which

8 violates the law as set forth in this Petition and would cause substantial harm to the natural
9 environment and the quality of life in the surrounding community. In addition, unless the
10 requested relief is granted, the environment will be adversely affected and injured by
11 Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA when certifying the EIR and approving the Project.

12 16. Petitioner actively participated in the Project's administrative approval process in
13 an attempt to ensure Respondents complied with CEQA and all other applicable laws.
14 17. Unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate, Petitioner has no plain,
15 speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law to require Respondents to set aside their
16 certification of the EIR, adoption of the Statement of Overriding Considerations, and approval of
17 the Project. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' decisions will remain in effect in
18 violation of state law.

19

20 18. EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

Petitioner has performed or will perform all conditions precedent to the filing of
21 this Petition. in Petitioner has actively participated in the administrative and environmental review
22  process prior to close of the public hearings on the Project and before Respondents posted a
23 Notice of Determination. Petitioners has fully exhausted administrative remedies to the extent
24 required by law. PRC §21177(a).

25 19. Respondents have taken final agency actions. Respondents had a mandatory duty
26 to comply with all applicable laws, including CEQA, prior to undertaking the discretionary
27 approvals at issue in this Petition. Petitioner possesses no effective remedy to challenge the
28 Project other than by means of this lawsuit.

STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

20. On October 31, 2018, the City Council approved the Project subject to approval of
the Mayor.

21. On November 2, 2018, Respondents posted the Notice of Determination for the
5 approvals of the Project.

6 22. The statute of limitations for a CEQA challenge to Respondents' decision to

8 Determination. CEQA Guidelines, 14 California Code of Regulations ("CCR") §§15094(g),
9 15112(c)(1). Because the 30th day after the Notice of Determination falls on Sunday, December
10 2, 2018, the limitations period extends to Monday, December 3, 2018. CCP §12.

14 24. Petitioner performed all conditions precedent to filing this Petition by serving
15 prior notice of the action. PRC §21167.5. A copy of the written notice letter is attached as
16 Exhibit A.

17 25. Petitioner will provide notice of this action to the California Attorney General by
18 serving copy of this Petition along with a notice of its filing. PRC §21167.7; CCP $388.

19 PREPARATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD

20 26. Petitioner elects to prepare the record of proceedings in this matter, and is filing its
21 notice of intent to prepare the record of proceedings with this Petition. PRC §21167.6. A copy
22 of Petitioner's Notice of Intent to Prepare Record is attached as Exhibit B.

23 CEQA LEGAL BACKGROUND

24 27. CEQA mandates that "the-long-term protection of the environment ... shall be the
25 guiding criterion in public decisions" throughout California. PRC $21001(d). CEQA requires
1
26 environmental factors to be considered at the "earliest stage before [the project] gains
27 irreversible momentum," Bozung v. LAFCO (1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 284 n.28, "at a point in the
28 planning process where genuine flexibility remains." Sundstrom v. County of Mendocino (1988)

6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

202 Cal.App.3d 296, 307 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Moreover, "the
2 'foremost principle' in interpreting CEQA is that the Legislature intended the act to be read so as
to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the
4 statutory language." Communities, for a Better Env't v. Cal. Resources Agency (2002) 103
5 Cal.App.4th 98, 109.

6 28. CEQA requires that an agency analyze the potential environmental effects of its
proposed actions in an EIR if "there is substantial evidence, in light of the whole record before

8 the lead agency, that the project may have a significant effect a on the environment." PRC
9 §21080(d). A "project" is "the whole of an action" directly undertaken or supported by a public
10 agency "which may cause either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably
11 .foresecable indirect physical change in the environment." PRC §21065; CCR §15378(a).

12 29. CEQA has two primary purposes. First, CEQA is designed to inform decision
13 makers and the public about a project's environmental effects. 14 CCR §15002(a)(1)). "The EIR
14 process protects not only the environment but also informed self-government." Laurel Heights
15 Improvement Ass'n v. Regents of the University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392.
16 Therefore, "[a]n accurate, stable and finite project description is the sine qua non of an

17  informative and legally adequate EIR." County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71
18 Cal.App.3d 185, 193.

19 30. Second, CEQA requires public agencies to identify ways to avoid or reduce
20 environmental damage and prevent such damage "by requiring changes in projects through the
21  use of alternatives or mitigation measures when the governmental agency finds the changes to be
22 feasible." 14 CCR §15002(a)(2), (3). Put another way, "agencies are required to give major
23 consideration to preventing environmental damage" and "should not approve a project as
24 proposed if there are feasible alternatives or mitigation measures available that would
25 substantially lessen any significant effects that the project would have on the environment." 14
26 CCR §15021(a).

27 31. CEQA requires that a lead agency analyze all significant environmental effects of
28 its proposed actions in an EIR. PRC §21100(b)(1); 14 CCR §15126(a). The EIR must not only

*
7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

identify the impacts, but must also provide "information about how adverse the adverse impact
2 will be." Santiago County Water Dist. v. County of Orange (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 818, 831.
32. If a project will have a significant effect on the environment, the agency may

4 approve the project only if it has "[e]liminated or substantially lessened all significant effects on
the environment where feasible" and finds that any unavoidable significant effects on the
6 environment are "acceptable due to overriding concerns." 14 CCR §15092(b)(2). When an
7 agency approves a project with significant environmental effects that will not be fully mitigated,
8 it must adopt a "statement of overriding considerations" finding that, because of the project's
overriding benefits, it is approving the project despite its environmental harm. 14 CCR §15043;
10 PRC §21081(b). A statement of overriding considerations expresses the "larger, more general
11 reasons for approving the project, such as the need to create new jobs, provide housing, generate
12. taxes and the like." Concerned Citizens of South Central LA v. Los Angeles Unif. Sch. Dist.
.13 (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 826, 847. A statement of overriding considerations must be supported by
14 substantial evidence in the record. 14 CCR §15093(b). Key among the findings that the lead
15 agency must make is: "Specific economic, legal, social, technological, or other considerations,
16 including the provision of employment opportunities for highly trained workers, make infeasible
17 the mitigation measures or alternatives identified in the environmental impact report" and that
18 those "benefits of the project outweigh the significant effects on the environment." PRC
19 §21081(a)(3), (b). Where the agency fails to impose all feasible mitigation measures, the
li
20 statement of overriding considerations is invalid. City of Marina v. Board of Trustees of the
21 California State University (2006) 39 Cal.4th 341, 368-69. - :48
22 33. A "feasible" alternative is one that is "capable of being accomplished in a
23 successful manner within a reasonable period of time, taking into account economic,
24 'environmental, legal, social, and technological factors. 14 CCR §15364. That an alternative may
25 be more expensive or less profitable does not demonstrate financial infeasibility; there must be
26 "evidence that the additional costs or lost profitability are sufficiently severe as to render it
27 impractical to proceed with the project." Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of Supervisors (1988)
28 197 Cal.App.3d 1167, 1180-81.

8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 34. An EIR must discuss significant cumulative impacts. 14 CCR §15130(a). This
2 requirement flows from Public Resources Code §21083(b)(2), which requires a finding that a
3 project may have significant effect on the environment if "possible effects of a project are

4 individually limited but cumulatively considerable," meaning "that the incremental effects of an
5 individual project are considerable when viewed in connection with the effects of past projects,

6 the effects of other current projects, and the effects of probable future projects." The CEQA

7 Guidelines define "cumulative impacts" as "two or more individual effects which, when
considered together, are considerable or which compound or increase other environmental
9 impacts." 14 CCR §15355. These "individual effects may be changes resulting from single
10 project or a number of separate projects." 14 CCR §15355(a).
11 35. An abuse of discretion under CEQA may be shown either because an agency
12 failed to proceed in the manner required by law or reached factual conclusions unsupported by
13 substantial evidence. E.g., Banning Ranch Conservancy v. City of Newport Beach (2017) 2
14 Cal.5th 918, 935. A procedural failure, such as whether an EIR failed to include essential
15 information, is reviewed de novo; in contrast, greater deference is accorded an agency's factual
16 conclusions. Id. In any event, "the reviewing court is not to "uncritically rely on every study or
17 analysis presented by a project proponent in support of its position. A clearly inadequate or
18 unsupported study is entitled to no judicial deference."" Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay
19 Committee v. Bd. of Port Comrs. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1355 (quoting Laurel Heights, 47
20 Cal.3d at 409 n.12). There is prejudicial abuse of discretion "if the failure to include relevant
21 information precludes informed decisionmaking and informed public participation, thereby
22' thwarting the statutory goals of the EIR process." Kings County Farm Bureau v. City of Hanford
233 (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 712 (citing Laurel Heights, 47 Cal.3d at 403-05).
24 FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

25. 36. On December 21, 2017, the City released a Draft EIR ("DEIR") on the Project for
26 public review and comment. According to the Draft EIR, the Project site is located on the

1 27 southeast corner of the intersection of Mateo Street and 4th Place, with Mateo Street forming the
28 western boundary and Santa Fe Avenue forming the eastern boundary of the site. 4th Place

.VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

1 abuts the site to the north, and existing commercial and industrial buildings border the site to the
2 south. The 97,460-square foot (2.24-acre) Project site is currently developed with an

3 approximately 80,736-square foot two-story warehouse distribution building containing four
4 tenants. The proposed Project would include the demolition of the existing warehouse building
and the construction of a mixed use live/work development containing up to 600 live/work units,

6 20,000 square feet of office space, 15,000 square feet of restaurant space, 15,000 square feet of
7 retail space, and 10,000 square feet of cultural space. The proposed Project uses would be

8 contained in a 13-story, approximately 150-foot high building and would contain a total floor
9 area of approximately 584,760 square feet,

10 37. On June 14, 2018, the Planning Commission approved the Project, including
11  certifying the EIR. Petitioner appealed to the City Council. On October 31, 2018, the City
12 Council denied the appeal, and approved the Project, subject to approval of the Mayor. In so
13 doing, the City Council, among other things, certified the EIR and adopted a Statement of
14 Overriding Considerations. On November 6, 2018, the Mayor approved the City Council's

15 actions.

16 38. Local 300 commented on the Project, raising significant issues with the EIR and
17| the Statement of Overriding Considerations.
18 Toxic Hazards.

19 39. The Project site has been used for heavy industrial uses for more than 100 years.
20 The Project Site was developed for industrial use and occupied by Los Angeles Iron & Steel
21 Company, California Industrial Rolling Mills, and Grinnell Company from at least 1894 until as
22 late as 1987; and was redeveloped for industrial use and occupied by the current industrial
23 structure from 1988 to the present. Tenants on site have included Los Angeles Iron & Steel
24 Company, California Industrial Rolling Mills, Grinnell Company, and ITT Grinnell Company
25 (1890-1987); and Dondex Universal Corporation, L & S Import Corporation, LA Kid, Weavers
26 Menswear Inc., Brother International Machine/Corporation, MC Apparel Service, INTEP
27 Graffix, Lee Limited Company, Palomares Apparel Inc., Revolt Clothing Co., Closet Inc., and
28 International Off-price (1988-2008).

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

•

1 40. Industrial use of the Project site and the surrounding area dates back to at least
2 1894, at which time the site was developed with a portion of Los Angeles Iron & Steel
3 Company's Rolling Mill. Historical occupant Grinnell Company was identified as a
4. manufacturer of pipe fittings, valves, and hangers associated with the fire protection industry,

5 piping systems for utility power plants and industrial humidification, pipe process networks for

6 chemical companies, and a custom pipe bender/shaper. Information indicates ITT acquired

7 Grinnell Company in 1969, and in 1976, Tyco Laboratories purchased the fire protection unit,
8 with remaining operations known as ITT Grinnell Corp. Garage/service operations are noted on
9 the eastern portion of the site on 1950-1970 Sanborn maps. Various hazardous materials such as
10  metals, solvents, and petroleum products were likely used on-site as part of historical industrial
11 operations.

12 41. Railroad tracks have been present to the east of the Project site since at least 1894,
13 with sidings historically present to the south as well as extending onto the site. Railroad tracks
14 represent an environmental concern due to the potential for contamination of surficial soils from
15 the historical application of oils containing polychlorinated biphenyls ("PCBs"), herbicides, and
16 arsenic for pest and weed control, as well as the potential presence of creosote on the rail ties, and
17 the historically common practice of using coal cinders for track fill material.

18 42. A limited Phase II Site Assessment was undertaken by URS Corporation in
19 September 2014. This study involved four soil borings to a depth of 10 feet below ground
20 surface on the Project site. Soil samples were collected at one, five, and 10 feet below the
21  surface, and were analyzed for metals, volatile organic compounds ("VOCs"), petroleum
22 "hydrocarbons, and PCBs. Specific individual soil samples were found to have detectable
23 concentrations of contaminants that will require further assessment and/or management during
24 site clearing and grading.

25 43. For example, the sample collected at one foot below ground surface in Soil Boring
26 1 exhibited a lead concentration of 1,940 parts per million (*ppm"), which renders the sample a
27 federally-regulated hazardous waste and is significantly above the California risk-based screening

28

11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

level of 320 ppm for commercial/industrial exposure. Lead is a known human carcinogen, and in
2 addition to cancer, it can cause birth defects and learning disabilities.

3 44. Further, arsenic was found elevated in the sample collected at one foot below
4 ground surface in Soil Boring 1 at a level of 78 ppm. Arsenic is known to cause cancer and birth
5 defects. PCBs were found in soil samples taken from Soil Boring 2 at both one and five feet
6 below ground surface at detectable concentrations (0.93 and 0.42 ppm at one and five feet,

7 respectively) that suggests some historical release, possibly associated with the leakage of past
8 transformers that may have been located on-site. PCBs are a highly toxic family of chemicals
9 known to cause cancer and birth defects at extremely low levels.

10 45. Despite the known presence of these highly toxic chemicals on the Project site, the
11 EIR fails to analyze their presence adequately and fails to adopt adequate mitigation measures to
12 'ensure worker safety and the safety of future residents and occupiers of the Project. The Draft
13 EIR states:

14 In order to ensure that potential impacts associated with excavation and grading of
15 the Project Site to accommodate the Project are reduced to a less than significant level, Mitigation Measure HAZ-MM-1 below requires a complete Phase II ESA to be performed
16 to fully characterize the soils beneath the site following the demolition of the existing structure on-site and prior to the commencement of soil removal activities, and the
17 implementation of all soil remediation and/or disposal recommendations contained within

18 the complete Phase II report.

19 DEIR p. 4F-14.

20 46. CEQA does not allow the City to analyze the known toxic chemicals after
21 approval of the Project. The EIR must identify and characterize the baseline presence of toxic
22 chemicals. Instead, the EIR defers full analysis until after Project approval, which is not allowed
23 under CEQA.

24 47. The EIR also improperly defers development of mitigation measures by providing
25 that if toxic chemicals are identified at some later time, then mitigation measures will be
26 developed at some later time. CEQA does not allow deferral of the development of mitigation

27 measures. See, e.g., Communities for a Better Environment v. City of Richmond (2010) 184

2 (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 327, 331-32.

3 48. Construction workers such as the members of Local 300 will be at the highest risk
4 from toxic soil contamination. The risk will also extend to future residents and occupiers of the
5 Project and neighboring residents.
6 Air Quality -

7 49. The environmental consulting firm Soil/Water/Air Protection Enterprise
8 ("SWAPE") commented on air quality, health risk, and greenhouse gas impacts, concluding that
9 the EIR is deficient on all three.

10 50. With respect to air quality, the EIR improperly analyzed the Project's construction
11 and operational emissions, including because the EIR used incorrect and unsubstantiated input
12 parameters. The EIR concludes that the Project's construction nitrogen oxides ("NOx")
13 emissions will be 94 pounds per day ("ppd"), slightly below the South Coast Air Quality
14 Management District ("SCAQMD") CEQA significance threshold of 100 ppd. The EIR
15 calculates that operations NOx emissions will be 51 ppd, also slightly below the SCAQMD.
16 CEQA significance threshold of 55 ppd.

17 51. These calculations are based on erroneous assumptions, For instance, the EIR
18  assumes that construction equipment will not move at all. The EIR also improperly reduces the
19 number of construction hauling trips, including by assuming all of the haul trucks will take one-
20 way trips only when they will actually make round-trips, which doubles the number of truck trips.
21 With respect to operations, the EIR's errors include incorrectly allocating the Project's
22 operational trips to various trip purposes, resulting in an underestimation of the emissions
23 associated with these trips. When SWAPE ran a proper air quality model that corrected the
24 errors, it demonstrated that the Project's construction NOx will be 157 ppd (well above the 100
25 ppd threshold), and operation NOx will be 62 ppd (above the 55 ppd threshold).

26 52. The Project's NOx impacts will be significant. Exceedance of duly adopted air
27 district CEQA significance threshold is evidence of a significant impact. NOx is a serious
28 "criteria" air pollutant. NOx reacts with other chemicals in the air to form both particulate matter

13
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDÄTE

+,* :

1 and ground level ozone. The Los Angeles air basin suffers from the worst ozone pollution in the
2 nation. The Project's NOx emissions will therefore be exacerbating an already unacceptable
3 level of air pollution, creating a significant cumulative effect.

4 53, According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, even short-term
5 exposure to ozone can have significant irreparable health impacts, including wheezing and
6 shortness of breath; damaging the airways; aggravating lung diseases such as asthma,
7 emphysema, and chronic bronchitis; making the lungs more susceptible to infection; and causing

g chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Recent studies consistently report associations between
9 short-term ozone exposures and total non-accidental mortality, which includes deaths from
10  respiratory causes.

11 54. SWAPE proposed a long list of feasible mitigation measures that the EIR did not
12 analyze because it erroncously concluded that the Project would have less than significant air
13 quality effects. Feasible mitigation would include solar panels, electric car stations, LEED
14 Platinum certification, and many other measures that have been implemented on other projects. • -n

15 The EIR expressly does not require solar panels, even though they are in wide use and are
16 feasible. DEIR, p. 4.H-23.
17 Health Risks

18 55. The EIR failed to conduct a Health Risk Assessment ("HRA") for the Project.
19  'The reasoning for this failure is inconsistent with guidance from the SCAQMD and the Office of
20 Environmental Health Hazards ("OEHHA") on when HRAs are needed. For example, OEHHA
21 recommends that all short-term projects lasting at least two months be evaluated for cancer risks
22 to nearby sensitive receptors. Construction on the Project is expected to take place over a 30-
23 month period.

24 56. SWAPE performed a screening-level HRA. SWAPE's analysis results in cancer
25 risk from the Project of between 42 and 620 per million - between four and 62 times higher than
26 the SCAQMD's threshold of 10 in one million. SWAPB concludes that "a refined HRA must be

27 prepared to examine air quality impacts generated by Project construction and operation using
28 site-specific meteorology and specific equipment usage schedules," and an EIR must "adequately

14
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

)

2 evaluate the Project's health risk impact, and should include additional mitigation measures to
reduce these impacts to a less-than-significant level." SWAPE proposes a long list of mitigation
3 measures that would reduce the Project's cancer risks, such as requiring ultra-low emission
4 construction equipment, electrified equipment, and many other measures. Because the EIR did

5

6 not even include a health risk assessment, it failed to analyze any mitigation measures.
Greenhouse Gases

57. The EIR concludes that the Project would have a less than significant greenhouse
gas impact without proper justification. For instance, the EIR uses a comparison of Project-
specific reductions to statewide reduction goals. DEIR, Table 4.E-4, p. 4.E-19. This is an
10 improper basis of comparison. Center for Biological Diversity v. California Department of Fish
11 and Wildlife (2015) 62 Cal.4th 204, 227.
12 58. SWAPE found that the EIR did not properly calculate the Project's greenhouse gas
13 emissions. When calculated properly, the emissions will be significant, particularly cumulatively
14 with other greenhouse gas emissions, and must be mitigated. SWAPE calculates that the
15 Project's greenhouse gas emissions would exceed the SCAQMD's screening threshold by a
16 multiple of four. This requires a more detailed review. SWAPE's more detailed review also
17 shows greenhouse gas emissions that exceeds SCAQMD's thresholds. The EIR did not do any of
18 the necessary analysis of greenhouse gases.

19 59. The EIR also relies on mitigation measures that are unenforceable. This is
20 improper because mitigation measures "must be fully enforceable through permit conditions,
21 agreements, or other legally binding instruments." 14 CCR §15126.4(a)(2).
22 •60. There are additional mitigation measures that are feasible that must be considered
23 'to reduce the Project's greenhouse gas emissions, such as solar panels and LEED platinum
24 I certification.

25 Traffic

26 61. Traffic engineer Daniel Smith, P.E., commented on traffic issues surrounding the
27 Project, and found the EIR deficient.
28

15
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 62. First, the EIR fails to describe existing traffic conditions accurately. The EIR uses
2 baseline conditions from as early as 2008, when the area was in the depths of the worst recession

3 since the 1930s. This time period is not representative of current traffic conditions. A thorough
set of more recent traffic counts is necessary to establishi an adequate baseline to analyze traffic

5 effects and needs.

63. Second, the EIR significantly undercounts traffic the Project will generate. For
example, Mr. Smith concluded that morning peak trips generated by the on-site restaurant should
be 13 times higher. He also concluded that the EIR drastically underestimates traffic generated
by the retail component of the Project. For instance, retail traffic is likely to be almost 10 times
10 higher - 1,534 daily trips, instead of the 166 trips set forth in the EIR.

11 64. Despite these and other significant traffic undercounts, the EIR concludes that by
12° 2020 the Project will significantly degrade traffic from current levels.

13 65. Although the Project will have significant effects on traffic, the EIR fails to
14 impose feasible mitigation measures. The EIR fails to identify feasible physical or operational
15 mitigation for any of the 11 impacted intersections except one, where physical improvements

16 were considered but found infeasible.

17 66. Instead, the EIR assumes that Transportation Demand Management ("TDM")
18 program and formation of a Transportation Management Organization ("TMO") for the Arts
19 District will result in a 20 percent reduction in the Project's traffic that would mitigate its traffic
20 impacts on the intersections disclosed as impacted, with one exception where impacts remain
21 significant and unavoidable. But there is no hard quantitative relationship between the
22 components of a TDM program or the actions of a TMO and the actual traffic reduction achieved,
23 Mr. Smith concludes: "The presumption of a 20 percent traffic reduction as the result of a TDM
24' plan adoption and a TMO formation is purely speculative." A public agency may not rely on
25 mitigation measures of uncertain efficacy or feasibility. See Kings County Farm Bureau, 221
26 Cal.App.3d at 728. There is no substantial evidence to support the EIR's assumption that the
27 TDM and TMO measures will reduce traffic impacts by 20 percent.

28

16
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

67. The traffic analysis also discloses that the Project would contribute traffic to 40
2 deficient freeway mainline segments, and would significantly increase queue problems at three

3 freeway off ramps. Yet the only mitigation proposed is that Real Party will consult with Caltrans
4 and make fair share payments toward improvements that will increase storage capacity on the
5 affected off ramps so that traffic will not hazardously queue onto the mainline lanes. This

6 mitigation is inadequate. Mitigation fees are not adequate mitigation unless the fees will fund a
7 specific mitigation plan that will actually be implemented in its entirety. See Anderson First
8 Coal. v. City of Anderson (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1173, 1188-89. The EIR does not identify
9 specific mitigation measures, and does not ensure that any mitigation measure will actually be
10 implemented. Nor did the EIR even examine what specific measures to increase off-ramp queue
111 storage capacity might be feasible. Therefore, the proposed mitigation measure is deficient.
12 Statement of Overriding Considerations

13 68. The City concedes that the Project will cause significant environmental effects that
14 will not be fully mitigated and therefore adopted a Statement of Overriding Considerations. The
15 findings in the Statement of Overriding Considerations are inadequate, particularly in making a

16 finding of infeasibility due to considerations under Public Resources Code §21081(a)(3), but not
17 making specific findings, supported by substantial evidence, concerning "the provision of
18 employment opportunities for highly trained workers" created by the Project. PRC §21081(a)(3).
19 69. The EIR makes no effort whatsoever to analyze the fiscal impacts related to jobs
20 to be created by the proposed Project or the quality of the new jobs. For example, the EIR is
21 devoid of any analysis of how the quality of jobs created compares to citywide averages. The

22 EIR makes no attempt to determine whether new jobs created by the Project, in either the
23 construction phase or the operational phase, will be for "highly trained workers," and what the
24 likely salary and wage ranges of these jobs will be. Without this information, the City lacks
25 'substantial evidence to make any statement of overriding considerations.
26 70. Despite comments raising the above issues, including expert evidence, the City
27| Council voted to approve the Project.
28

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 71. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the paragraphs set forth above.

3 72. CEQA requires the lead agency for a project to prepare an EIR that complies with
4 the requirements of the statute.

5 73. Respondents violated CEQA by certifying an EIR for the Project that is inadequate :

6 and fails to comply with CEQA. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion because they
failed to proceed in a manner required by law and because their decision is not supported by
8 substantial evidence, which precluded informed decisionmaking and informed public
9'participation.

10 74. The analysis in the EIR failed to comply with CEQA, including by: (a) failing to
11  'analyze properly the known toxic chemicals present on the Project site, (b) analyzing air quality
12 using erroneous assumptions that understate construction and operational emissions, (c) failing to
13 analyze health risks, (d) incorrectly finding greenhouse gas emissions less than significant, and
14 i(e) inaccurately describing existing traffic conditions and understating the Project's effects on

15 traffic.

16 75. Based on the above failures of analysis, the EIR also did not conduct a proper
17 Finquiry into mitigation measures, including by deferring development of mitigation measures to
18 deal with those toxic hazards and failing to adopt feasible mitigation measures with respect to air
19| quality, health risks, greenhouse gases, and traffic.
20 76. The EIR did not conduct a proper cumulative impacts analysis, including for air
21  quality, greenhouse gas emissions, and traffic.
22 77. The EIR is inadequate as an informational document because it does not provide
23 adequate information about toxic hazards, air quality, health risks, greenhouse gases, or traffic.

24 78. Respondents further violated CEQA by adopting findings that are inadequate as a
25 matter of law in that they are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, particularly by
26 adopting the Statement of Overriding Considerations without specific findings concerning the
27 Project's employment opportunities for highly trained workers, and without accurately
28: identifying all of the Project's significant adverse environmental impacts.

18

79. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents' certification of the EIR,

2 adoption of the Statement of Overriding Considerations, and approval of the Project should be set

3 aside.

5 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays that the Court:

6 1. Issue a stay of Respondents' decisions approving the Project pending trial;
2. Issue a peremptory writ of mandate directing:
