Petition for Writ of Mandamus

Petitioner alleges:

Introduction

1. Petitioner Napa Valley Model Railroad Historical Society brings this

5 mandamus action in the public interest to challenge the state's discretionary action to

6 eliminate the Napa Valley Model Railroad Historical Society from its longstanding
venue on the grounds of the Napa Valley Exposition Fairgrounds. The Model Railroad 8

9 IS a recreational, cultural, educational, and historical resource enjoyed by thousands of

10 visitors each year, with its lease automatically renewing for many decades.

11 The Napa Valley Expo Board of Directors published a "2017 Draft Expo Master a
12

13 Plan" in February 2017 to "guide future planning, decisions, financial priorities, and

14 overall management of the Napa Valley Expo." Among the changes considered in the

15 Draft Plan were the permanent removal of various Expo facilities, including the Model

16 Railroad. The Draft Plan acknowledged that to comply with the California
17

18 Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the Expo Board's final Expo Master Plan approval

19 and implementation would first "require preparation of an Environmental Impact

20 Report (EIR) in order to evaluate the specific and cumulative environmental impacts"
21 of the Plan and to identify mitigation measures and alternatives. 22

23 Yet the Expo Board instead began to implement the Draft Plan without any

24 CEQA notice or environmental review process. Among other things, over the repeated

25 objections of the Model Railroad Historical Society the Board took discretionary actionsl
26

27 to terminate the Model Railroad lease to make way for additional parking spaces

28 contemplated in the Draft Master Plan. It also approved the demolition of additional

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 1

1 Expo buildings to provide a site for a proposed new Main Pavilion. And it approved

2 grading, irrigation, and sod installation to accommodate the Bottle Rock music festival,
3

4 with significant unstudied water use. All such actions were part of the Expo Draft

5 Master Plan. No CEQA review occurred before the piecemealed approvals.

6 This was error. It is too early for the Expo Board to commit to the vision of the

7 Draft Master Plan. The Board's ill-conceived, discretionary decision to remove the
8

9 Model Railroad facility requires CEQA review to consider environmental impacts and

10 feasible alternatives in a public forum. Environmental review processes must be

11 scrupulously followed early in the planning process to avoid a meaningless post hoc

12 rationalization of decisions already made. Further, a discretionary project or plan
13

14 cannot be segmented into pieces but must be reviewed as a whole. The California

15 Supreme Court has made clear that agency actions are illegally premature if they move

16 a project's momentum significantly forward before environmental review is complete.
17

18 Here, absent this Court's writ, the Expo Board proposes to remove the Model Railroad

19 from its home at the Napa Valley Expo Fairgrounds and to proceed with other Draft
20 Master Plan projects, in manifest violation of CEQA.

21 This Court's writ is of critical importance not only to the future of the Napa Valley
22

23 Expo but to the state's ongoing implementation of CEQA. The Expo Board's

24 discretionary approvals of physical actions furthering the Draft Master Plan at the Napa

25 Valley Expo must be set aside pending certification of an adequate EIR that fairly
26 considers feasible mitigation measures and Plan alternatives.

1 Jurisdiction

2
2. This Court has jurisdiction under Public Resources Code sections 21168.5 3

4 and Code of Civil Procedure section 1085. The parties and project site are in Napa

5 County. Venue is proper in Alameda County because the respondents are a state agency

6 and its directors that are represented by the California Attorney General who maintains
7
offices in Oakland.
8

9 Parties

10 3. The Napa Valley Model Railroad Historical Society (Society) is a California
11

12 non-profit corporation whose mission is to represent and interpret to the public the

13 agricultural and industrial heritage of the Napa Valley region through the use of a 4,600

14 square foot scale model railroad exhibit at the Napa Valley Exposition Fairgrounds. The
15 Society provides a welcoming environment where disciplines in railroad operating 16

17 practices, miniaturization, electrical engineering, computer programming, mechanical
18 engineering, landscape artistry, regional history, and economics can be learned and

19 shared with the public in a multi-generational setting. The Society's members include
20

21 community residents and concerned citizens who enjoy and appreciate the Napa Valley

22 Model Railroad resource. The Society brings this petition on behalf of all others

23 similarly situated too numerous to be named and brought before this Court as

24 petitioners. The Society and its members objected to the implementation of the Expo
25

26 Draft Master Plan and exhausted their available administrative remedies.

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 3

1 4. Respondent California ex rel. 25th District Agricultural Association Napa

2 Valley Exposition (the Expo) is California State institution established by the

3 California Legislature. Agricultural Associations are subject to regulation by the
4

5 Department of Food and Agriculture. The Expo is the lead agency under CEQA for the

6 Napa Valley Exposition Master Plan and took actions to implement the Expo Master

7 Plan without CEQA compliance. The Board of Directors of the California ex rel. 25th
8

9 District Agricultural Association Napa Valley Exposition (the Board) is the legislative

10 body of the Expo. The California Department of Food and Agriculture, Division of Fairs

11 and Expositions, is the state agency charged with regulating the Expo.

12
5. Does 1 to 20 are fictitiously-named respondents and real parties in interest
13

14 whose true names and capacities are currently unknown to the Napa Valley Model

15 Railroad Historical Society. If and when their true names and capacities are known, the

16 Society may amend this petition to assert them.

19 General Allegations

20 6. The paragraphs below refer to and rely on information in documents

21 relating to this action, all of which will be filed with this Court as part of the record of
22
proceedings
23 and which are here incorporated by reference.

24 Environmental Setting

25 7. The Napa Valley Model Railroaders began in 1955 with a small layout in
26

27 the Southern Pacific West Napa depot, a moving to a building at the Napa Fairgrounds in

28 moved to the Veteran's Home at Yountville in the the late 1950's. The organization

Petition for Writ of Mandamus

1 1960s, with a layout in a one of the buildings' basement. It returned to Napa in 1969-70

2 following donation of two used 50° x 20' Quonset Huts that came from the World War
3 II-era Basalt Corporation ship construction facility at the Port of Napa. The buildings 4

5 had been moved to the Napa Fairgrounds as part of the animal displays from the 1950s

6 and 1960s.

7 8. The Napa Valley Model Railroad Historical Society raised funds and built a
8

9 2-story center building to connect the two donated Quonset Huts into an L-shaped

10 building. The building opened in April 1970 and a new layout featuring the geography

11 and historical businesses of the Napa Valley region was built. This layout has remained
12 at the Expo for 47 years and is currently operated by the Society.
13

14 9. Parts of the current layout remain from the original construction in the

15 early 1970s. It has been a popular community resource since that time as a regular part

16 of the annual Napa Town and Country Fair and other public events at the Fairgrounds.
17

18 In the last year, the model railroad was open to the public for 69 days, not counting

19 many visits by school groups and other community/youth/tourist groups. Admission is

20 free for all visitors.

21 Project Approval
22

23 10. The Expo Board initiated an Expo Master Plan revision process at the start

24 of 2016. Two prior draft master plans since the 1990s were never implemented. The
25 new Draft Master Plan was published in February 2017, and proposed the removal of 26

27 the Model Railroad building in Phase 4B - one of the last steps of the proposed $100+

28 million modernization of the Fairgrounds. The Society objected to the planned removal

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 5

1 of the Model Railroad. The Draft Master Plan recited that an EIR would be prepared'

2 before the Plan was finalized and implemented.

3
11. In the spring of 2017, the Expo Board approved the installation of five
4

5 acres of sod at the Fairgrounds, requiring grading and irrigation. No formal approval or

6 environmental review occurred. On July 25, 2017, the Expo Board voted to remove the

7 Model Railroad building from the Fairgrounds by the end of the year. No CEQA notice
8
or environmental review occurred.
9

10 12. During the 5-day Town and County Fair in August 2017 the Model Railroad

11 hosted more than 4,000 visitors, and over 1,600 of them signed protest letters objecting

12 to the proposed removal of the Model Railroad. The letters were sent to the Expo Board
13

14 and the threatened eviction was front-page news.

15 13. In September 2017, the Expo Board approved the demolition of additional

16 buildings at the Fairgrounds in preparation for the Main Pavilion proposed in the
17 Master Plan. The demolitions have not yet occurred. There has been no CEQA review.
18

19 14. In October 2017, the sod planted in the spring of 2017 was significantly
20 damaged during the wine country wildfires. Petitioner alleges on information and belief

21 that the Expo Board intends to proceed to reinstall the sod despite unaddressed
22

23 significant water supply impacts. No public notice or CEQA review has occurred.

24 15. In October 2017, the Society, through its counsel, contacted the Expo

25 Board and its counsel and offered to meet and confer to discuss the long-term tenancy

26 of the Model Railroad. The Society explained that the Expo Board's proposed
27

28 discretionary eviction of the Model Railroad is a project subject to CEQA and a as part of

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 6

1 the Expo Master Plan it cannot proceed without prior compliance with CEQA. Through

2 counsel, the Expo Board declined to discuss settlement.
3
16.
4 In December 2017, the Society received a notice dated November 28, 2017,

5 declaring that the Society's Expo lease would terminate in 30 days. On December 12,

6 2017, the Expo Board held a public meeting at which it agendized discussion of "the

7 repurposing of the former Model Railroad site for highest and best use" and the "hiring
8

9 of a CEQA consultant to review Draft Master Plan." Speakers attended to object to the

10 Model Railroad eviction. The Board continued the "repurposing" discussion until

11 January and rejected the hiring of : CEQA consultant.

12
17. This action is timely filed within 30 days of the receipt of the termination
13

14 notice in December 2017 and within 180 days of the Expo Board's action in July 2017 to

15 approve the termination of the lease by the end of 2017.

16 18. The Napa Valley Model Railroad Historical Society has no plain, speedy,
17

18 and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. Issuance of a peremptory writ is

19 needed to avoid immediate, severe, and irreparable harm to Napa County residents.

20 The Expo Board has the capacity to correct its violations of law but has failed and
21 refused to do so.
22

23 Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act
24

25 19. The Society incorporates all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.

26 20. The state respondents have and continue to abuse their discretion and fail
27

28 to act in the manner required by law in implementing the Expo Master Plan without

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 7

1 first preparing and certifying a project EIR and meeting all mandates of CEQA.

2 21. CEQA requires that environmental review be completed before any action

3

4 can be taken to approve or implement the Expo Draft Master Plan in any way. The Expo

5 Board's approval of building demolitions, installation of sod and irrigation systems, and
6 termination of the Napa Valley Model Railroad Historical Society tenancy are

7 discretionary actions with potentially significant environmental impacts. Such actions
8

9 Iconstitute an abuse of discretion and a failure to proceed in the manner required by law

10 and must be set aside to assure an adequate EIR process.

11

12 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays:

13 1. That the Court issue a peremptory writ of mandamus ordering the Expo

14 Board to rescind its actions taken to implement the Expo Draft Master Plan, including
15

16 but not limited to demolitions of Fairground buildings, grading and installation of sod

17 and irrigation systems, and termination of the Model Railroad tenancy or interference

18 with the ongoing operation of the Model Railroad facility as a recreational, cultural,
19 historic, and educational resource pending the preparation of an adequate EIR and full
20

21 compliance of CEQA's procedural and substantive mandates;

22 2. That the Court issue a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary

23 injunction prohibiting the Expo Board and its employees from proceeding with any
24

25 actions pursuant to the Draft Master Plan, including but not limited to demolitions of

26 Fairground buildings, grading and installation of sod and irrigation systems, and

27 termination of the Model Railroad Historical Society tenancy or interference with the

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 8

1

1 ongoing operation of the Model Railroad facility as a recreational, cultural, historic, and

2 educational resource, while this action is pending;
3
3. For costs and attorney fees pursuant to CCP section 1021.5; and
4

5 4. For such other and further relief as the Court finds proper.
