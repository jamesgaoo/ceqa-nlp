1 Plaintiff, Lower Austin-Kidd Creek Conservancy, alleges:

2 Introduction

Plaintiff Lower Austin-Kidd Creek Conservancy seeks judicial review of Respondent California
4 Department of Forestry and Fire Protection's June 22, 2018, decision approving Non-Industrial Timber
5 Management Plan 1-15NTMP-007 SON (Kidd Creek) [hereinafter referred to as "the Plan"] submitted by
6 real party in interest Lytton Rancheria of California, on grounds that Respondents' approval does not comply
7 with the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), the California Forest Practice Act, and the Forest
8 Practice Rules. The Plan proposes timber operations, including road building and logging on five hundred
9 and seventy-nine (579) acres of land in the Russian River watershed in Sonoma County, California.
10 Parties

11 2. Plaintiff, LOWER AUSTIN-KIDD CREEK CONSERVANCY (hereinafter "Plaintiff"), is an
12 association of concerned citizens founded to advocate ecological sustainability and protect the health of the
13 forests and watersheds in the lower Russian River watershed area. Plaintiff and its members are beneficially
14 interested in the aesthetic enjoyment and continued productivity of the land, in the preservation of wildlife
15 species at self-perpetuating population levels, and in environmental protection. Many of Plaintiff's members
16 live in close proximity to the land subject to the Plan and use the same roads that the Plan will use for
17 hauling timber and transporting heavy logging equipment. Plaintiff and its members are beneficially
18 interested in Respondents' full compliance with the law before Respondents approve the Plan. Respondents|
19 owed a mandatory duty to comply with the legal duties that Plaintiff alleges were violated before approving
20 the Plan. Plaintiff has the right to enforce the mandatory duties that CEQA, the Forest Practice Act, and the
21 Forest Practice Rules impose on Respondent.
22 3. Respondent KEN PIMLOTT is Director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection
23 and is named herein solely in that capacity. Respondent CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY
24 AND FIRE PROTECTION is an agency of the State of California located in Sacramento, California. Both
25 Respondents are hereinafter referred to as "Cal Fire."
26 4. Plaintiff does not know the true names and capacities of Respondents fictitiously named herein as
27 DOES through 20, inclusive. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon allege, that such fictitiously|
28 named Respondents are responsible in some manner for the acts or omissions complained of or pending
29  herein. Plaintiff will amend this Petition to allege the fictitiously named Respondents' true names and
30 capacities when ascertained.

5. Real Party in Interest LYTTON RANCHERIA OF CALIFORNIA is identified in the Plan as the
2  "timber owner of record" and the "timberland owner of record." The Plan identifies LYTTON
3 RANCHERIA OF CALIFORNIA's address as 437 Aviation Blvd., Santa Rosa, California.
6. Real Party in Interest JAMES BEYERS is an individual identified in the Plan as the "plan submitter."
Under the Forest Practice Rules, the Plan Submitter has dozens of responsibilities for ensuring the accuracy
6 and completeness of the Plan as well as for ensuring its faithful execution. A small subset of these
7 responsibilities are listed in Forest Practice Rule 1090.9. The Plan identifies JAMES BEYERS' address as
8 P.O. Box 878, Santa Rosa, California, 95402, Real Parties LYTTON RANCHERIA OF CALIFORNIA and
9 JAMES BEYERS are collectively referred to herein as "Real Parties."
10 7. Plaintiff does not know the true names and capacities of Real Parties in Interest fictitiously named
11 herein as DOES 21 through 40, inclusive. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon allege, that such
12 fictitiously named Real Parties in Interest are responsible in some manner for the acts or omissionsl
13 complained of or pending herein. Plaintiff will amend this Petition to allege the fictitiously named Real
14 Parties in Interest's true names and capacities when ascertained.
15 Notice Requirements
16 8. In accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167.5, Plaintiff served Respondent Cal Fire
17 with written notice of commencement of this action on July 17, 2018. The Notice of Commencement of
18 Action and Proof of Service thereof are attached hereto as Exhibit 1.
19 9. In accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388,
20 Plaintiff has provided a copy of this pleading to the Attorney General's office. Proof of Service thereof on
21 the Attorney General's office is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.
22 Jurisdiction

23 10. Plaintiff brings this action as a Petition for Writ of Mandate and the Court has jurisdiction over the
24 claims alleged herein pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and Public Resources Code
25 sections 4514.5, 21080.5(g), and 21168.
26 Standing
27 11. Plaintiff and its members are beneficially interested in Respondents' full compliance with the law
28 before Respondents approve the Plan. Respondents owed a mandatory duty to comply with the legal duties
29 that Plaintiff alleges were violated before approving the Plan. Plaintiff has the right to enforce the
30 mandatory duties that CEQA, the Forest Practice Act, and the Forest Practice Rules impose on Respondent.

Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies

2 12. Plaintiff has exhausted all available administrative remedies in that Respondent's approval of the
3 Plan is final and not subject to further administrative appeal procedures.
4 13. In accordance with Public Resources Code section 21177, subdivision (b), Plaintiff and its members
5 objected to the approval of the project orally or in writing during the public comment period or prior to the
6 close of the public hearing on the project before the filing of notice of determination.
7 14. In accordance with Public Resources Code section 21177, subdivision (a), all grounds for non-
8 compliance with CEQA, the Forest Practice Act and the Forest Practice Rules alleged herein were presented
9 to Cal Fire during the public-comment period for or prior to the close of the public hearing on the Plan; or
10 in the alternative, there was no opportunity for members of the public to raise the grounds of noncompliance
11 alleged in this Petition prior to Cal Fire's decision to approve the Plan.
12 Private Attorney General Doctrine
13 15. Plaintiff brings this action as a private attorney general pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
14 1021.5 to enforce important rights affecting the public interest. Issuance of the relief requested in this
15 Petition will confer a significant benefit on a large class of persons by ensuring that Cal Fire does not
16 approve the Plan without complying with CEQA, the Forest Practice Act and the Forest Practice Rules. The
17 necessity and financial burden of enforcement are such as to make an award of attorney's fees appropriate |
18 in this proceeding. Absent this timely enforcement action by Plaintiff, the Plan might otherwise be deemed
19 lawfully approved, despite Cal Fire's failure to comply with CEQA, the Forest Practice Act and the Foresti
20 Practice Rules.

21 Factual Background
22 16. Real Parties submitted the Plan to Cal Fire on November 12, 2015. Cal Fire returned the Plan to
23 Real Parties November 20, 2015, to correct numerous deficiencies in the NTMP. Real Parties resubmitted
24 the Plan to Cal Fire on January 4, 2016, and Cal Fire accepted the Plan for filing on January 14, 2016.
25 17. Cal Fire conducted an on-site Pre-Harvest Inspection on February 16, 2016, and February 23, 2016,
26 which was attended by representatives of Cal Fire, California Department of Fish and Wildlife, Californial
27 Geological Survey, and the North Coast San Francisco Regional Water Quality Control Board, and issued
28 its Pre-Harvest Inspection Report on March 8, 2016.
29 18. The first public comment period on the Plan ended on May 15, 2017. On March 8, 2018, Cal Fire
30 recirculated the Plan for an additional 30 days public comment period, which ended on April 9, 2018. On

May 11, 2018, Cal Fire again recirculated the Plan for an additional 30 days public comment period, which
2 ended on June 11, 2018.

3 19. In response to agency and public comments, Real Party submitted numerous revised Plan pages to
4 Cal Fire, which Cal Fire incorporated into the Plan.

22: Plaintiff hereby realleges and incorporates the preceding paragraphs of this Petition as though set

10 forth in full.

11 23. In approving the Plan, Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion in violation of CEQA, the

25 June 11, 2018, regarding Foothill Yellow Legged Frog, Greenhouse Gases and Climate Change, and

26 Salmonid and Watershed Impacts.

27 24. In particular, but without limitation, Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion by failing to

modification by timber operations, including herbicide use; failing to comply with Forest Practice Rule 30

7 with all operational limitations within Watercourse and Lake Protection Zones and failing to adequately
8 explain and justify such failures as "in lieu practices."
9 25. These violations of law include, without limitation:

22 adverse environmental effects.
23 26. Plaintiff has no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law and will suffer
