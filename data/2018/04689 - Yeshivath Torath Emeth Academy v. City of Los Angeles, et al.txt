ATTORNEYS AT LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF PETITION

2 1. Petitioner Yeshivath Torath Emeth Academy brings this action under the
3 California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code sections 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"),

4 and Los Angeles Municipal Code section 12.24, to compel Respondent City of Los Angeles
("City") to set aside conditional use permits ("CUPs") issued for the sale and dispensing of

6 alcoholic beverages and patron dancing at the Lyric Theatre (the "Project"), which is located at

7 520, 520 1/2 and 522 North La Brea Avenue, Los Angeles, California (the "Lyric Property"),
8 and comply with its legal duty to prepare an environmental impact report ("EIR") for the Project.
9 2. Petitioner also brings this action under the California Alcoholic Beverage Control
10 Act ("ABC Act") to compel the City to rescind its approval of an application for Determination
11 of Public Convenience or Necessity for the sale of alcoholic beverages for on-site consumption
12 at the Lyric Property.

13 3. The approval of this Project involves the City's complete dereliction of its legal
14  duties under CEQA, the Los Angeles Municipal Code ("LAMC"'), and the ABC Act. Petitioner
15 and other members of the quiet Orthodox Jewish community consisting of schools, synagogues,
16 senior facilities, and residences surrounding the Lyric Property have raised many concerns about
17  the operation of that a property as a concert venue with alcohol service, in violation of the Certificate
18 of Occupancy that has for decades made clear that the use of the property is limited to a school.
19 4. In 2016 Real Parties in Interest sought the City's approval for the CUPs to allow
20 the Lyric Theatre to operate as a concert venue, nightclub and theater with dancing, serving a full
21 range of alcohol, from 10 a.m. to 2 a.m. daily, with a capacity of 318 guests.

22 5. Petitioner, other sensitive uses in the area, and many others, including hundreds of
23 members of the Orthodox Jewish community in the area, protested this vast expansion of
24 operations at the Lyric Theatre, submitting substantial evidence to the City both in writing and
25 with oral testimony showing that the Project would result in significant environmental impacts
26 and that the Project would be incompatible with the uses in this neighborhood.
27 6. The City ignored that evidence. After Petitioner and others appealed a Zoning
28 Administrator's decision on the CUPs, on February 26, 2018, the City's Central Area Planning
2
LATHAM&WATKINSw
ATTORNEYS AT LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
LOS ANGELES

F Commission ("CAPC") disregarded substantial evidence in the record in its decision to reject

2 those appeals, adopt an inadequate Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND") for the Project, and

3 issue the requested CUPs. The CAPC relied exclusively on the MND as the environmental

4 clearance for the approval of the CUPs.

5 7. As expressly permitted by CEQA and City procedures, Petitioner and a number of

6 other concerned community members then appealed the approval of the MND by the CAPC to
7 the Los Angeles City Council, the legislative body having jurisdiction over the CAPC. Petitioner

8 and other concerned community members submitted further evidence, including additional

9 expert reports, demonstrating the significant impacts that would occur from operation of the
10 | Project. As provided for by CEQA and City procedures, the only item before the City Council
11 on appeal was the adequacy of the MND approved by the CAPC.

12 8. Months after the CAPC's approval of the MND and the appeals of that MND to
13 City Council, the Los Angeles Department of City Planning (*Planning Department"), issued a
14 completely new proposed Negative Declaration for the Project directly to the City Council,
15 bypassing all legal procedures required for the adoption of a new environmental clearance for the
16 | proposed Project. The Negative Declaration was never considered by the CAPC, whose decision
17 in approving the CUPs was based on the MND. A mere week before the City Council hearing
18 on the appeal of the MND, the Planning Department again bypassed proper legal procedures and
a 19 issued a second new environmental clearance directly to the City Council, a Categorical
20 Exemption for the Project. The Categorical Exemption was never considered by the CAPC.

21 9. The only item before the City Council on the appeal of the MND was the
22 adequacy of the MND. The City Council had no jurisdiction over the wholly new environmental
23 documents issued after the CAPC's action. (See Pub. Resources Code, § 21151, subd. (c).)
24 Moreover, Petitioner and other members of the community submitted substantial evidence to the

25 record demonstrating the potentially significant environmental impacts that would result from
26 the Project, and why an EIR needed to be prepared for the Project.
27 10. Despite its lack of jurisdiction, on August 29, 2018, the City Council rejected
28 Petitioner's and others' CEQA appeals, ignored the prior MND for the Project, ignored the
3
LATHAM&WATKINSw VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE ATTORNEYS AT LAW
LOs ANGELES

- substantial evidence in the record, including expert testimony regarding potentially significant

2 environmental impacts, and instead adopted both the Negative Declaration and the Categorical
3 || Exemption. The City Council failed to confirm the adequacy of the MND approved by the

4 CAPC and by adopting both new CEQA documents that were not before the CAPC and ignoring

5 the MND, the City failed to proceed in the manner required by CEQA. The City's failure to
6 j grant the appeals and require the preparation of an EIR ignored the substantial evidence in the

7 Project's record demonstrating that the Project could result in significant environmental impacts.

8 11. The law requires a lead agency to prepare an EIR for a project whenever

9 substantial evidence in the record supports a "fair argument" that a project may have a
10 significant effect on the environment. This standard sets a low threshold for the preparation of

11 an EIR. It is clear from the evidence in the record including the testimony given at hearings,

12 hundreds of protests and opposition letters submitted by community members, legal analysis,

13 expert reports, and the fact that the proposed concert venue and nightclub will be located literally

14 next door to a synagogue, a few feet from a school, across from a senior residence, a and near
15 another 10 sensitive uses, that the threshold is met. This Court should set aside the CUPs, the
16  purported CEQA clearances, and the Determination of Public Convenience or Necessity, and

17 require the City to prepare an EIR for the Project.

18 THE PARTIES

19 12. Petitioner Yeshivath Torath Emeth Academy ("Torath Emeth") is a private
20 Orthodox Jewish school with its main address at 540 North La Brea Avenue, Los Angeles,

21 California 90036, less than 200 feet north of the Lyric Property. Torath Emeth operates its

22 school in several buildings along North La Brea Avenue and either adjacent to or nearby the

23 Lyric Property, with addresses that include 529, 540, 555, and 636 North La Brea Avenue, as

24 well as additional locations on West Clinton Street. The location of Torath Emeth's school

25  buildings are marked with an X on Exhibit A to this Petition. Torath Emeth is a California non-
26 profit corporation doing business as Yeshiva Rav Isacsohn, and is commonly referred to as

27 Yeshiva Rav Isacsohn Torath Emeth Academy. Torath Emeth serves over 1,000 students from

28 ages 2 to 14 and has served the surrounding community for several decades.

5 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

6 19. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to sections 1085 and 1094.5

7 of the Code of Civil Procedure and section 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code. The Court

8 has jurisdiction to issue injunctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 526, and is otherwise

9 authorized to grant the relief prayed for herein.
10 20. Venue is proper in the County of Los Angeles, where the Lyric Property and the
11 City are located, and where the violations of law alleged herein occurred.

12 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

13 A. The Lyric Property Is Surrounded by Sensitive Uses

14 21. The Project has been the subject of heated controversy in the Beverly-La Brea
15 neighborhood of the City, a historically Orthodox Jewish community. The immediate area
16 where the Lyric Theatre intends to operate its concert venue is home to families, schools,
17 synagogues, retirement communities, and a number of other sensitive uses. For decades,

18 Orthodox Jewish families have resided in this quiet and safe neighborhood full of small
19 | businesses, schools, synagogues and other community-based uses. Torath Emeth has served the
20 community for several decades and enrolls over 1,000 children from ages 2 to 14 years of age.
21 Torath Emeth's values reflect those of the community.

22 22. The Lyric Property sits within the same block as a variety of sensitive uses other
23 than Torath Emeth. For instance, Jewish Learning Exchange (a synagogue), City View (seniors
24 residences and assisted living), and La Brea Rehabilitation Center (nursing home and
25 rehabilitation) are all within 500 feet of the Lyric Property. Other nearby sensitive uses include
26 single and multi-family residences, Bnos Devorah High School, Congregation Kollel Yechiel
27 Yehuda, Bais Yaakov School for Girls, Bikur Cholim House, Congregation Levi Yizchok, and
28 the Al & Hedi Azuz child and family services. To the east, separated from the Lyric Property by
6
LATHAM&WATKINSW
ATTORNEYS AT LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
LOS ANGELES

a narrow alley, is 102-unit condominium complex located at 525 North Sycamore Avenue.

2 Other apartment buildings and condominium complexes line North Sycamore Avenue in the
immediate vicinity of the Lyric Property. In total, there are at least 13 sensitive uses within

4 1,000 feet of the Lyric Property.

5 23. It is in this neighborhood, in the midst of Orthodox Jewish schools, synagogues, a

6 senior assisted living facility, and a senior nursing home and rehabilitation facility, that the Lyric

7 Theatre intends to operate a nightclub with public dancing and live entertainment that will sell

8 and serve alcohol for on-site consumption, with the ability operate until 2:00 a.m. daily.

B. The City's Unlawful Approval of the Project's CUPs and MND

10 24. The Lyric Property is developed with a single-story, 3,516 square foot art school

11 subject a to a Certificate of Occupancy issued by the City on January 27, 1958. Despite the

12 Certificate of Occupancy limiting the use to a school, in 2007, the Lyric Theatre began

13 unlawfully operating the Lyric Property a as a nightclub and concert venue. That illegal operation

14 continued for years, with nearby residents reporting experiencing disruptive incidents, including

15 reports of drunken and stoned patrons making their way to their cars.

16 25. In 2015 and 2016, the Lyric Theatre hosted hundreds of events at the Lyric
17 Property illegally, without a required conditional use permit, through the issuance of one- to

18 three-day temporary permits issued by the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control
19 ("ABC"'). These events occurred despite the fact that the Lyric Property was still subject to a

20 Certificate of Occupancy for a school and without any City-required CUPs. (See Exhibit B

21 [photos of events held without any conditional use permit].)

22 26. In early 2016, finally recognizing that the Lyric Theatre had been operating

23 unlawfully, Real Party in Interest Lyric LLC applied to the City's Department of Building and

24 Safety ("LADBS") for a permit to conduct tenant improvements at the Lyric Property and to

25 change its use from that of a private school to a theater with lounge ("Change a of Use Permit").

26 On June 1, 2016, LADBS issued the Change of Use Permit without notification to the

27 community.

28

7
LATHAM&WATKINSw
ATTORNEYS AT I VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
LOs ANGELES

27. Despite issuance of the Change of Use Permit, Petitioner is informed and believes

2 and based thereon alleges that Real Party in Interest Lyric LLC never completed the
improvements proposed under the permit. Accordingly, on July 3, 2018, the Change of Use

4 Permit expired, and the Lyric Property remains subject to the 1958 Certificate of Occupancy,

5 which allows operation of a school, not a theater and lounge.

6 28. On July 19, 2016, Real Party in Interest Dorothy M. Braun, as Trustee of the
7 Dorothy M. Braun Trust ("Applicant"). applied to the Planning Department for the Project's

8 CUPs, which would be necessary to operate the Lyric Property with alcohol service and dancing.

9 More specifically, Applicant sought a CUP a pursuant LAMC Section 12.24- W.1 to allow the sale

10 and dispensing of a full line of alcoholic beverages for on-site consumption, and a CUP pursuant

11 to LAMC Section 12.24-W.18(a) to allow patron dancing, both in conjunction with the Change
12 of Use of the Lyric Property from a school to a "new" theater with live entertainment and a new

13 400 square foot dance floor. As proposed, the Project would operate daily from 10:00 a.m. to 2

14 a.m., with space for up 318 patrons and no on-site or off-site parking.

15 29. Because the Project's CUPs are discretionary actions, the Project is subject to
16  environmental review under CEQA. On or about July 19, 2016, in conjunction with the

17 application for the CUPs, the Applicant filed an Environmental Assessment Form with the City.

18 30. The Planning Department prepared an MND for the Project. In the MND, the

19 City recognized that the Project could result in significant impacts on the environment, but
20 concluded that "mitigation measures have been included to reduce impacts to less than

21 significant levels." For instance, in assessing the Project's potential noise impacts, the City

22 concluded that mitigation measures had been included in the MND "[gliven the potential to

23 impact neighboring sensitive uses." However, although the MND stated that the Project would
24 result in potentially significant noise impacts on neighboring sensitive uses, the MND failed to
25 include a single mitigation measure to address those potentially significant noise impacts, a clear

26 violation of CEQA. The MND failed to comply with CEQA in many other respects, as described

27 herein.

28

8
LATHAM WATKINS 4
ATTORNEYS AT LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
LOS ANGELES

31. On September 8, 2016, the City published notice of intent to adopt the MND in
2 the Los Angeles Times, which indicated that the public review and comment period for the MND

3 would expire on September 28, 2016.

4 32. Thereafter, many members of the community, including Torath Emeth, submitted
5 opposition emails and letters to the Planning Department raising genuine and legitimate concerns

6 about and objections to the Project.

7 33. On October 25, 2016, the City's Zoning Administrator held public hearing
8 regarding the Project. At the conclusion of the hearing, the City's hearing officer announced that

9 the matter would be held under advisement, and that comments on the Project would be accepted
10 until November 8, 2016.

11 34. From the date of the hearing until November 8, 2016, the Planning Department
12 received hundreds of emails opposing the Project from members of the community, raising
13 concerns such as its lack of parking; the noise impacts it would have on nearby schools,
14| businesses, residences, and religious institutions; traffic impacts that could result from the
15 Project; the Lyric Theatre's problem with drunken and disorderly patrons; and other legitimate
16 concerns.

17 35. Despite substantial evidence in the record demonstrating the negative impacts of
18 the Project on the nearby sensitive uses, the Project's potentially significant environmental
19 impacts, the inability of the City to make the required findings for the Project's CUPs under the
20 LAMC, as well as vocal opposition from the community, on April 4, 2017, the Zoning
21 Administrator issued a written decision approving the CUPs. In approving the Project, the
22 Zoning Administrator relied on the MND that the City had prepared for the Project.
23 36. After issuance of the written decision, the Planning Department failed to mail
24 properly its notice of the decision to all parties who had requested such notice. Because of that
25 failure, on November 28, 2017, the Planning Department reopened the appeal period to allow
26 any aggrieved parties to file an appeal of the Zoning Administrator's decision.

27 37. On December 11, 2017, Torath Emeth timely appealed the Zoning
28 Administrator's decision to the CAPC. In addition, several other members of the community
9
LATHAM&WATKINS
ATTORNEYS AY LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
LOS ANGELES

P timely appealed the decision, including La Brea Rehabilitation Center, LLC, Bnos Devorah High
2 School, Rabbinical Council of California, City View, Lawrence Polon, Congregation Kollel

3 Yechiel Yehuda, and Jewish Learning Exchange. Appellants submitted ample and substantial

4 evidence to the CAPC that the Project was not suitable for the area, that the City could not make

5 the findings required for the CUPs under the LAMC, and that the Project would have a

6 significant effect on the environment, thus requiring an EIR.

7 38. In early 2018, over 700 concerned parents, residents, rabbis, community

8 members, business owners, and others in the predominantly Orthodox Jewish surrounding the

9 Lyric Property signed a petition opposing the Project.
10 39. That petition was submitted to the City along with a February 16, 2018, letter sent
11 on behalf of Torath Emeth, which explained in detail why the proposed concert venue would
12 have substantial environmental impacts on the community, and why the required findings for

13 granting the Project's CUPs could not be made. As the letter and substantial evidence in the

14 record made clear, operation of the Project would not only create substantial impacts but it would
15 not enhance the built environment in the surrounding neighborhood, would not provide an

16 essential service or benefit to the community, and would adversely affect the welfare of the
17  community including the appellants' schools, synagogues, senior care facilities and other uses.

18 40. On February 26, 2018, ignoring the evidence before it, and in violation of its legal
19  duties under the LAMC and CEQA, the CAPC denied the appeals, adopted the MND, and

20 sustained the Zoning Administrator's decision to approve the CUPs for the Project. On March
21 14, 2018, the CAPC issued its final letter of determination approving the CUPs and adopting the
22 MND.

23 C. The City's Illegal Actions During the CEQA Appeal of the MND

24 41. On March 20, 2018, pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21151(c),
25 Petitioner appealed the CAPC's adoption of the MND to the Los Angeles City Council.
26 42. On March 23, 2018, Jewish Learning Exchange, Bnos Devorah High School, City
27 View, La Brea Rehabilitation Center, LLC, Rabbinical Council of California, and Congregation

28 Kollel Yechiel Yehuda also appealed the CAPC's adoption of the MND to the City Council.
10
LATHAM•WATKINSw VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE ATTORNEYS AT LAW
LOS ANGELES

43. On June 8, 2018, the City Clerk mailed notice of a June 19, 2018, public hearing

2 on the appeals that was to be held by the City Council's Planning and Land Use Management

3 ("PLUM") Committee.

4 44. Prior to that hearing, on June 15, 2018, Petitioner sent correspondence to the

5 PLUM Committee requesting that the City Council grant the appeals and require the preparation

6 of the EIR. That correspondence included substantial evidence supporting a fair argument that

7 the Project may result in a significant effect on the environment, including expert reports from
8 traffic and noise consultants with substantial experience evaluating development projects in the

9 City of Los Angeles, as well as other evidence.

10 45. The PLUM Committee continued the June 19, 2018, hearing to July 31, 2018.

11 46. Then, on July 5, 2018, the day after Independence Day, the Planning Department
12 published notice in the Los Angeles Times that it was now proposing to adopt a Negative

13 Declaration for the Project, which notice purported to require that comments on the Negative
14 Declaration be submitted to the Planning Department on or before July 25, 2018. The Negative

15 Declaration was not considered by the CAPC.

16 47. On July 23, 2018, the Planning Department transmitted the Negative Declaration

17 to the City Council, with the intent that the City Council would adopt the Negative Declaration
18  instead of the MND approved by the CAPC, despite the fact that the sole basis of the CEQA

19 appeal was the MND considered and approved by the CAPC and the City Council had no
20 jurisdiction over a new environmental document not considered by the CAPC.

21 48. In addition, despite the fact that multiple appeals of the MND had been filed, the

22 City failed to mail the notice of intent to adopt the Negative Declaration to any of the appellants.

23 Petitioner learned of the Negative Declaration by checking the Project file, and on July 25, 2018,

24 submitted a comment letter to the Planning Department and PLUM Committee objecting to the
25 Planning Department's unlawful end-run around CEQA and submitting substantial evidence that
26  the Project would have a significant impact on the environment.

27 49. The PLUM Committee continued the July 31, 2018, hearing on the CEQA appeal

28 to August 28, 2018.
11
LATHAM•WATKINS-P
ATTORNEYS AT LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
LOS ANGELES

P 50. But the Planning Department continued to take actions in violation of CEQA. On
2 August 23, 2018, notwithstanding substantial evidence in the record demonstrating a fair
3 argument that the Project would result in significant impacts, the Planning Department
4 transmitted to the PLUM Committee a completely different CEQA document, a proposed Notice
5 of Exemption for its consideration. In its transmittal, the Planning Department wrongly
6 indicated that the Project could be approved by the City Council by finding that Categorical
7  Exemption Class 1, Category 22 applied to the Project. Again, the Categorical Exemption was
8 never before the CAPC.

9 51. On August 28, 2018, the PLUM Committee finally held its public hearing on the
10 CEQA appeals. In contravention of its obligations under CEQA and disregarding substantial
11 evidence in the record, the PLUM Committee both adopted the Negative Declaration and
12  determined that the Project was exempt from CEQA. The PLUM Committee also adopted the
13 findings of the CAPC as the findings of the Council. In denying the appeals and taking these
14 unlawful actions, the PLUM Committee entirely ignored the MND that was approved by the
15 CAPC-the only subject of the appeal and the only item truly before the City Council.
16 52. On August 29, 2018, the City Council approved the PLUM Committee's actions.
17 53. On August 30, 2018, the City posted both a Notice of Determination and a Notice
18 of Exemption with the County Clerk, both of which indicated that they would be posted from

19 August 30, 2018, until October 1, 2018.

20 D. The City's Unlawful Approval of the Project's Application for a

21 Determination of Public Convenience or Necessity

22 54. In addition to needing CUPs, the Project also needs an alcoholic beverage license
23 to operate. On May 17, 2018, Real Party Lyric Presents LLC applied to the ABC for an
24 alcoholic beverage license for the Lyric Property. As part of its licensure process, pursuant to

25 Business and Professions Code sections 23958 and 23958.4, the ABC delegates to the applicable
26 local government the determination of whether the license would be in the public convenience or
27 necessity. On May 31, 2018, Braun applied to the City to make such a determination in its favor.
28

12
LATHAM&WATKINSw VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE ATTORNEYS AT LAW
LOS ANGELES

1 55. Torath Emeth opposed the application before the City Council, submitting

2 substantial evidence demonstrating why the application should be denied under the ABC Act

3 because issuance of a license would create a law enforcement problem and result in an undue
4 concentration of licenses in the census tract where the Lyric Property is located.

5 56. On August 29, 2018, ignoring such substantial evidence in the record, the City

6 Council issued a Determination of Public Convenience or Necessity in favor of the Project.

7 THE CITY VIOLATED THE LAW IN APPROVING THE PROJECT

8 57. The City's actions in approving the Project violated CEQA, the LAMC, and the

9 ABC Act. A writ of mandate must issue that requires the City to vacate its approvals of the

10 CUPs, prepare an EIR for the Project, and rescind its Determination of Public Convenience or

11 Necessity for the Project.

12 A. The City Council Lacked Jurisdiction Over the Negative Declaration and the

13 Categorical Exemption

14 58. The City Council had no jurisdiction over either the proposed Negative
15 Declaration or Categorical Exemption. Public Resources Code section 21151(c), the statute
16 governing CEQA appeals to the City Council, is clear-"[i]f a nonelected decisionmaking body

17 of a local lead agency certifies an environmental impact report, approves a negative declaration

18 or mitigated negative declaration, or determines that a project is not subject to this decision, that
19 certification, approval, or determination may be appealed to the agency's elected
20 decisionmaking body, if any." (Emphasis added.)

21 59. Under CEQA, these documents are not interchangeable. The MND for the

22 Project was appealed to the City Council-the Negative Declaration and Categorical Exemption

23 were not. In fact, they never existed at the time of the CAPC's action. Indeed, these newly

24 created substitute documents were never seen or approved by the CAPC or any other
25 decisionmaking body.

26 60. Because the City does not have an ordinance implementing Public Resources

27 Code section 21151(c), the City has looked to its staff to develop policies and/or guidelines to

28 implement the statute. Petitioner is informed and believes and based thereon alleges that the City
13
LATHAM&WATKINSw
ATTORNEYS AT L VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

LOs ANGELES

H has been handling CEQA appeals to the City Council by following a December 30, 2005,
2 memorandum prepared by former Deputy Director of City Planning Robert H. Sutton ("'Sutton

3 Memo") (See Exhibit C.) As is clear under the procedures outlined in the Sutton Memo, the only
4 item before the Council was the MND. Moreover, the Sutton Memo states that "[t]he filing of an

5

6 appeal stays proceedings in the matter until the City Council has made a decision." Because of
that stay, the Planning Department's further actions to introduce the Negative Declaration and
7 Categorical Exemption were made in excess of applicable jurisdiction-the matter was stayed

8 during the appeal of the MND and the Planning Department was barred from proposing new
9 | environmental clearance documents.

10 61.

11 Neither Public Resources Code section 21151(c) nor the City's own procedures
outlined in the Sutton Memo contemplate that the Council may create and review a wholly new
12  document, never appealed and not before the prior decisonmaking body. Under CEQA, the only
13

14 question before the Council was whether the environmental clearance that was before the non-

15 elected planning commission met the requirements of CEQA. Clearly the MND before the
CAPC does not meet the requirements of CEQA. If the City wanted to rely legitimately on the
16 Negative Declaration or the Categorical Exemption as CEQA clearance for the Project, the Lyric
17  needed to restart the consideration of the Project at the Zoning Administrator.
18 62.

19 Indeed, both the Zoning Administrator and the CAPC on appeal relied heavily on
the MND in approving the Project's CUPs. To attempt to substitute the environmental review
20 | considered by the Zoning Administrator and CAPC with a Negative Declaration or Categorical
21

22 Exemption would undermine the entire discretionary review and appeal process mandated by
CEQA.

23 B.

24 The Categorical Exemption Used by the City Does Not Apply, and Even If it

25 Did Unusual Circumstances Bar Its Use for the Project

63. a The City improperly relied on a Class 1, Category 22 Categorical Exemption for
26 the Project. That category covers the "[g]ranting or renewal of a variance or conditional use for

27 a nonsignificant change of use in an existing facility." The Lyric Theatre's current certificate of
28 occupancy is for a school. The Project, as permitted by the CUPs, would allow the Lyric

LATHAM&WATKINSP 14

ATTORNEYS AT L
LO$ ANGELES VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Property to be used as a nightclub with alcohol service and dancing and concerts that would

2 persist until 2:00 a.m. daily. The Project would invite hundreds of patrons into the neighborhood,

3 on a daily basis, causing traffic, noise, and safety issues. The change in character of the existing

4 facility would be anything but "nonsignificant." Thus, a Class 1, Category 22 Categorical

5 Exemption is inapplicable to the Project.

6 64. But even if the Categorical Exemption did apply, unusual circumstances bar its
7 | application to this Project. "A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where

8 there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment

9 due to unusual circumstances." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15300.2, subd. (c).) "[A] party may

10 establish an unusual circumstance with evidence that the project will have a significant

11 environmental effect." (Berkeley Hillside Pres. v. City of Berkeley (2015) 60 Cal.4th 1086,

12 1105.) Further, a "party invoking the exception may establish an unusual circumstance without

13 evidence of an environmental effect, by showing that the project has some feature that
14 distinguishes it from others in the exempt class, such as its size or location.. . . [T]he party need

15 only show a reasonable possibility of a significant effect due to that unusual circumstance."

16 (Ibid.) The record contains detailed evidence of the significant impacts likely to result from the

17 Project. Beyond that evidence, the proposed nightclub and concert venue is to be located in

18 close proximity to at least 13 sensitive uses, in an Orthodox Jewish community with hundreds of
19 residents objecting to the proposed use. A school serving young children is located near the

20 Project site, and a synagogue, a retirement home and other uses are in the same block.

21 Substantial evidence demonstrates that the Categorical Exemption is inapplicable.

22 C. The Project Description Is Inadequate

23 65. The project description set forth in the City's CEQA documents is inadequate.
24 The adequacy of a project description is closely linked with the adequacy of an environmental

25 document's analysis of the project's environmental effects. An accurate and complete project
26 description is necessary for an intelligent evaluation of the project. Otherwise, the lack of

27 accurate information impairs the public's right and ability to participate effectively in the

28 environmental review process.
15
LATHAM&WATKINSw
ATTORNEYS AT LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

+4 66.

2 The project description in the MND and Negative Declaration inaccurately

3 describes the proposed use as allowing "the sale and dispensing of a full line of alcoholic

4 beverages for on-site consumption and patron dancing in conjunction with a 3,516 square-foot

5 theater with live entertainment with 128 seats, with hours of operation from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00

6 a.m. daily." This description fails to describe the actual proposed operations as testified to by

7 Real Parties in Interest at the hearings and in other evidence presented to the City.

67. The project description fails to mention that this is essentially a concert venue and
8 nightclub and as shown on the project plans in the record the operational configuration with the

9 dance floor shows that there would be no seating in the area in front of stage. The project
10 description in the MND fails to mention that in the concert venue and nightclub configuration the

11 occupancy of the Lyric could be up to 318 persons not 128 persons. Speakers on behalf of the
12 Lyric Theatre whom testified at the Project's public hearings confirmed this capacity for events

13

14 with no seating in the stage area. A venue that sells and serves alcohol for on-site consumption

15 from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m. nightly in combination with patron dancing for up to 318 patrons is
a concert venue and nightclub, not a theater.

16 68.

17 As a result of the inaccurate and incomplete project description, the MND fails to

18 accurately disclose the potential range of impacts and assess the significant impacts that will

19 a occur as a result of the project operating as a concert venue and nightclub.

D.

20 69. Potential Significant Impacts Require the Preparation of an EIR

21 The law is clear that a public agency must prepare an EIR whenever substantial
evidence supports a fair argument that proposed project may have a significant effect on the
22 |l environment. Here, substantial evidence in the record supports a fair argument that the Project
23

24 may have a significant effect on the environment, and thus an EIR must be prepared before the
City can take any action to approve the Project.

25 70.

26 Under CEQA, "significant effect upon the environment" is defined as "a

27 substantial or potentially substantial adverse change in the environment." (Pub. Resources Code

28 § 21068; 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15382.) A project "may" have a significant effect on a the

LATHAM&WATKINSw environment if there is a "reasonable probability" that it will result in a significant impact. (No

2 Oil, Inc. v City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 83, n.16; Sundstrom v County of Mendocino

3 (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 296, 309.) If any aspect of a proposed project may result in a significant

4 impact on the environment, an EIR must be prepared. "The fair argument standard creates a

5 'low threshold' for requiring an EIR, reflecting a legislative preference for resolving doubts in

6 favor of environmental review." (Latinos Unidos de Napa v. City of Napa (2013) 221
Cal.App.4th 192, 200.)

7 71.

8 Here, it is clear from the evidence in the record, including the testimony given at

9 the CAPC hearing, expert reports assessing the Project's impacts, and the fact that the Project

10 will be located literally next door to a synagogue, close to a school, across from a senior

1I residence, and near another 10 sensitive uses, that the threshold is met. The City violated CEQA

12 when it failed to prepare an EIR for the Project, as the Project would result in significant impacts
across multiple environmental areas.

13 72.

14 Noise Impacts. Neither the MND nor the Negative Declaration fully or

15 accurately studies the Project's noise impacts on the community. Indeed, the MND and Negative
Declaration contain several errors, fail to include mitigation measures where required, and ignore
16 | potentially significant impacts on the neighboring community.

17 73. Substantial evidence in the record supports a fair argument that the Project would
18  result in significant noise impacts, including : report prepared by noise experts Acoustical
19 Engineering Services (AES). The City unlawfully approved the Project without any mitigation

20

21 measures to mitigate these potentially significant noise impacts.
74. Land Use Compatibility. The MND and Negative Declaration state: "A
22  significant impact would occur if the proposed project physically divided an established

23 community. The project would not create a physical barrier with an established community.
24 || Therefore, no impact would occur." This analysis finds no support in the record and fails to
25 comply with CEQA.

26 75.

27 The MND and Negative Declaration fail to accurately study the significant land
use compatibility impacts that would result from the establishment of a concert venue and
28 nightclub within the midst of several sensitive uses surrounding the Lyric Property. Indeed ,the

LATHAM&WATKINSw 17

ATTORNEYS AT LAW
LOs ANGELES VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

t MND and Negative Declaration fail to fully describe all of the several sensitive uses within
2 1,000 feet of the Lyric Property.

3 76. Moreover, the MND and Negative Declaration applied the wrong standard in

4 assessing whether the Project would result in land use compatibility impacts. The determination
5 of whether a project creates a significant land use compatibility impact must consider several

6 factors, including but not limited to disruption of a community.

7 77. Substantial evidence in the record supports a fair argument that the Project would
8 result in significant land use compatibility impacts as it would disrupt this long established

9 residential community with many sensitive uses virtually next door to the proposed concert
10  venue. The City must prepare an EIR to study and mitigate the Project's potentially significant
11 land use compatibility impacts.

12 78. Parking and Neighborhood Intrusion Impacts. The Lyric Property has not one
13 parking space on-site. The Applicants acknowledge in their application and the record confirms
14 that the Lyric Property has no on-site parking and no off-street parking is proposed for its
15  patrons. Further, there are no public parking lots or structures within the vicinity of the Lyric
16 Property. With up to 318 people at any one time at the Lyric Property, the residential streets in
17 the vicinity of the Lyric Property will be significantly impacted.

18 79. Traffic generated by a project may result in neighborhood intrusion impacts; or, in
19  other words, impacts resulting from project traffic shifting to local streets in residential
20 neighborhoods. The MND and Negative Declaration entirely ignore the likelihood that the
21 Project will result in potentially significant impacts.

22 80. As documented in an expert report prepared by a traffic consultant with decades

23 of experience, the Project could result in an additional 150-200 vehicle trips from a sold out

24 performance. Because of the Project's lack of parking, the parking demand for such vehicle trips
25 would spill into the adjacent residential neighborhoods, including the residential neighborhood
26 directly east of the Lyric Property. Substantial evidence supports a fair argument that the Project
27 would result in significant neighborhood intrusion impacts.

28

18
LATHAM&WATKINSw VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE ATTORNEYS AT LAW
LOS ANGELES

1 81. Odors. The MND and Negative Declaration also fail to examine potentially

2 significant odor impacts to sensitive users such as children, worshipers, and residents that will

3 occur with over 300 people making their way to and from the Lyric Property. This issue needed

4 to be further studied in an EIR.

5 82. Urban Decay. Members of the Orthodox Jewish community that surround the

6 Lyric Property walk during the day, the evening and night. There frequently are afternoon, early

7 evening and nighttime events at the adjacent schools, and study and worship at the synagogues
8 often extend well into the night. Substantial evidence shows that the Lyric Theatre's past events

9 have resulted in conflicts with the sensitive uses in the community. Increased activity at the

10 Lyric Property could further exacerbate the problem, leading to potentially significant urban

11 decay impacts. The MND and Negative Declaration fail to study such potential impacts.

12 83. Mandatory Findings of Significance. A lead agency must find that a project

13 may have a significant effect on the environment and thereby require an EIR for the project when
14 substantial evidence in the record demonstrates that "[t]he environmental effects of [the] project

15 will cause substantial adverse effects on human beings, either directly or indirectly." (Emphasis
16 added.) (CEQA Guidelines § 15064.5(a)(4); see also Pub. Resources Code § 21083(b)(3).) A

17 change to the physical environment that might otherwise be minor must be treated as significant

18 if people will be significantly affected. Substantial evidence in the record demonstrates that this

19 test is met here. An EIR must be prepared.

20 E. The Citv's Approval of the CUPs Violated the LAMC

21 84. The City's approval of the Project's CUPs violated the LAMC. The City may not

22 approve a CUP for a project unless it makes several important findings, including that "the

23 project will enhance the built environment in the surrounding neighborhood or provide a service

24 that is essential or beneficial to the community, city, or region" and is "compatible with and will
25 not adversely affect or further degrade adjacent properties, the surrounding neighborhood, or the

26 public health, welfare, and safety[.]" (LAMC Ç 12.24-E.) The findings adopted by the City

27 under LAMC section 12.24-E have no evidentiary support. To that end, to the extent the City's

28

19
LATHAM&WATKINSw
ATTORNEYS AT LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
LOs ANGELES

P

2 findings rely on the Change of Use Permit, such findings are not supported by substantial
evidence as the Change of Use Permit expired prior to the City's final action on the Project.
85.

4 Further, under LAMC § 12.24-W, in order to approve a CUP for the sale or

5 dispensing of alcoholic beverages, the City must make several additional findings. The City

6 purported to make those findings when approving the Project, but none of them have sufficient
evidentiary support.

7 86.

8 In addition, the City failed to follow the correct procedures in approving the
City's CUPs. The City's approval of the CUPs must be reversed.

9 F.

10 The City's Determination of Public Convenience or Necessity Is Arbitrary
and Not Supported by Substantial Evidence

11 87.

12 Substantial evidence in the record demonstrates that neither the public

13 convenience nor necessity is served by is the Project. The City does not have unlimited discretion
to determine whether an alcoholic beverage license would serve the public convenience or
14  necessity. Indeed, the City may "not act arbitrarily or rely on factors that are not supported by
15 substantial evidence." (Nick v. City of Lake Forest, 232 Cal.App.4th 871, 884.)
16 88. The law is clear that it is appropriate for an agency to deny an application for
17 determination of public convenience or necessity where crime in the area is higher than average
18 or where church and youth meetings are held nearby. Other factors that local governments may
19 consider when making a Determination of Public Convenience or Necessity are: whether area is

20

21 targeted by law enforcement, high number of law enforcement calls, or elevated rates of alcohol-
related crime; consistent history of undue concentration; proximity to sensitive land uses; health
22 : indicators in the area (alcoholism rates, homelessness, etc.); youth demographics in the
23 immediate area; and business operation variables (high percentage of alcohol to non-alcohol
24 sales, late night operations, high percentage of untrained/underage staff, inadequate security,
25 etc.). (See, e.g., Cal. Council on Alcohol Policy, Public Convenience or Necessity: A Guide for
26 Local Government and Interested Citizens (March 2006).)

27 89. There is no indication that the Lyric Theatre's operation as a nightclub is in the
28 public convenience or necessity under any of the above factors. In addition to the significant

LATHAM&WATKINSw 20

ATTORNEYS AT LAW
LOS ANGELES VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

P adverse environmental impacts that the community will endure as the result of the Project,
2 another alcoholic beverage license will add to the already high crime in the area. The number of

3 crimes for the crime reporting district where the Lyric Property is located is 22 percent greater
4 than the city average (181 crimes v. 221 crimes).

5 90. The addition of a seven-day-a week concert venue and nightclub open until 2:00

6 a.m. discharging upwards of 300 people in this area of sensitive uses would increase the need for
7 police services and increase crime in the area. Increasing the likelihood of criminal activity is

8 not convenient or necessary. Finally, there are significant numbers of youth in the area who

9 meet for afterschool activities as well as numerous other surrounding sensitive uses, including

10 religious organizations and a community that have vigorously protested the Project.

11 91. Further, there is a clear over concentration of alcohol within the area. The record

12 is clear that there are currently 13 on-site and 3 off-site ABC alcohol licenses in the census tract,

13 which greatly exceed the ABC's licensing criteria of 2 on-site and 1 off-site licenses in the
14 subject census tract (Census Tract 1919.02).

15 92. The City offers no reasoning for its Determination whatsoever, issuing only a
16 | perfunctory document that states that the issuance of a license for the Project "will serve a Public

17 Convenience or Necessity and will not tend to create a law enforcement problem." As the City

18 supplied no justification for its action, it is impossible to know what convenience or necessity is

19 served that overcomes the considerable drawbacks of an alcoholic beverage license being issued
20 for the Project. The City's finding that the Project is in the public convenience or necessity is

21 arbitrary and not supported by substantial evidence.

22 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

23 93. Petitioner has exhausted all administrative remedies available to it, and has no
24 plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, to ensure appropriate City

25 review of the Project. All violations alleged herein were raised by Petitioner or others during the
26 administrative process for the Project.

27 94. Petitioner has written many detailed letters, submitted comprehensive expert
28 reports, and provided overwhelming evidence of environmental impacts and of the surrounding

P community's opposition to the Project• all to no avail. The City failed to engage meaningfully
2 with Petitioner regarding the Project and its potentially significant environmental impacts.
3 95. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.7 by serving a

4 copy of this Petition on the California Attorney General. (See Exhibit D.)

5 96. Petitioner has also complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by
6 providing the City with notice of intention to commence the action. (See Exhibit E.)

7 97. Petitioner elects to prepare the administrative record, as reflected in the Notice of

8 Election to Prepare the Administrative Record filed concurrently with this Petition.
9 IRREPARABLE HARM

10 98. Absent injunctive relief, Petitioner will suffer irreparable harm from significant
11 impacts that the City has failed to avoid or mitigate through environmental review of the Project.
12 99. Damages are not adequate to compensate Petitioner for the City's violations of
13 CEQA and significant impacts to health, safety, and the environment that the Project will create.
14 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (WRIT OF MANDATE - VIOLATIONS OF CEQA)
16 100. Petitioner realleges and incorporates in full all preceding paragraphs by this
17 reference.

18 101. By enacting CEQA, the California Legislature sought to require all public
19 agencies to give careful, deliberate consideration to preventing environmental damage. (CEQA

20 Guidelines, § 15021, subd. (a)(1).) Whenever a public agency is required issue a discretionary
21 approval for a proposed project, the CEQA process is triggered to ensure that the project's
22 significant environmental impacts are avoided or mitigated where feasible. (Pub. Resources

23 Code, § 21080.)

24 102. If there is substantial evidence supporting a fair argument that a proposed project
25 may have a significant effect on the environment, the public agency with authority to grant
26 discretionary approval for the project must initiate a public, comprehensive environmental-
27 review process under CEQA and prepare an EIR. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15064.)
28

22
LATHAM&WATKINS:LP
ATTORNEYS, VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
LOS ANGELES

103. As alleged, substantial evidence supports a fair argument that the Project's
2 proposed operations may have significant environmental impacts on the environment, including

3 but not limited to, noise impacts and impacts to traffic, odor, and land use compatibility.

4 104. In addition, the City failed to proceed in the manner required by CEQA when it
adopted both the Negative Declaration and Categorical Exemption and ignored the only CEQA

6 document properly before the City Council - the inadequate MND that had been prepared for the

7 Project.

8 105. The Categorical Exemption does not apply to the Project. In addition, unusual

9 circumstances demonstrate that the Project would have significant environmental impacts on the
10 | environment, making the use of any categorical exemption inapplicable.

11 106. The City also violated CEQA by failing to provide proper notice to interested
12 parties and by failing to submit CEQA documents to state agencies with jurisdiction over the
13 Project; most notably, ABC.

14 107. Because the City has failed to conduct the appropriate comprehensive
15 environmental review of the Project, the City has abdicated its responsibilities under CEQA, and

16 a peremptory writ of mandate is necessary to compel the City to fulfill its duties under State law.

17 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

18 (WRIT OF MANDATE - VIOLATIONS OF THE LAMC)

19 108. Petitioner reallages and incorporates in full all preceding paragraphs by this

20 reference.

21 109. LAMC sections 12.14-E and 12.24-W provide that the City must make specific

22 and required findings to support its approval of CUPs involving the sale or dispensing of

23 alcoholic beverages and for patron dancing.

24 110. As alleged, substantial evidence does not support the City's findings, and the City

25 failed to follow the correct procedures in approving the CUPs.
26 111. The City's approval of the CUPs is contrary to the law and must be reversed.

MEMORANDUM

Date: December 30, 2005

To: All Planners
Barbara Grcaves, City Clerk's Office

From: Robert H. Sutton, Deputy Director

Re: TEMPORARY PROCEDURES - Filing an Environmental Appeal Under CA Public Resources Code Section 21151 (c) (CEQA)

The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), Section 21151 (c), permits appeal of certain decisions by non-elected decision-making body of a local lead agency, as follows: 1) certification of an environmental impact report, 2) approval of a negative declaration or
mitigated negative declaration, or 3) determination that a project exempt from CEQA. These decisions may be appealed to the agency's elected decision-making body, if any.
In consultation with the City Attorncy's Office the following temporary procedures have been set
up:

1. An aggrieved party can file a 21151 (c) appeal within the next five meeting days of the City Council during which the City Council has convened in regular session, after the mailing of the non-elected decision-making body's decision. Any appeal not filed within the specified time
will not be considered.

2. The appeal shall be filed at one of the Department of City Planning's Public Counters on a
form provided by the Department. The appeal needs to set forth the points on how the
Environmental Document fails to comply with CEQA.

3. The filing of an appeal stays proceedings in the matter until the City Council has made a
decision

4. The City Clerk will notify the applicant 15, but not less than 10 days prior to the PLUM hearing on the Section 21151 (c) appeal.
5. As the Council only has the environmental appcal in front of them, if the Council finds that the Environmental Document failed to comply with CEQA the related case will need to be
remanded back.

6. The intent is for Council to act with 30 days from the expiration of the appeal period.

EXHIBIT C
37

The above temporary procedure for implementing CEQA Section 21151 (c) appcals is only utilized when the city's final decision, including all appeals, on a discretionary project is made by a non-clected official or body. For the Planning Department this occurs when the appeal process ends with the City Planning Commission or the Area Planning Commission.
As this process evolves we will keep you informed.
