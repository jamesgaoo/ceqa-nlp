1 T. INTRODUCTION

2 1. Petitioner Raptors Are The Solution ("Petitioner") challenges Respondent California

3 Department of Pesticide Regulation's ("Respondent" or "DPR") determination to renew the
registrations of seven rodenticides without initiating the reevaluation process pursuant to state law

5 (hereinafter, the "Project'). The seven rodenticides are: (1) brodifacoum; (2) bromadiolone; (3)

6 difethialone; (4) difenacoum; (5) diphacinone; (6) chlorophacinone; and (7) warfarin.

7 2. These rodenticides have been implicated in numerous poisonings of non-target wildlife

8 including raptors (owls, hawks, eagles etc), bears, bobcats, mountain lions and a host of other

9 wildlife that prey on target wildlife species such as rats, mice and gophers that have ingested the

10 rodenticides. Non-target wildlife harmed by rodenticides include species of special concern as

11 well as species listed under the federal and/or state Endangered Species Acts.

12 3. Petitioner challenges Respondent's approval of the Project as contrary to the California

13 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Pub. Res. Code § 21000 et. seq. Respondent took a

14 discretionary action without adequately assessing the potentially significant impacts of continued

:15 use of the rodenticides on non-target wildlife, without assessing the feasibility of non-harmful

16 alternatives, without consulting with the trustee agency, the California Department of Fish and

17 Wildlife ("DFW"), and without responding to Petitioner's comments provided in the

18 administrative proceedings below. See Pub. Res. Code $ 21080.5.

19 4. Petitioner also challenges the District's approval of the Project as contrary to state law,

20 including but not limited to requirements that Respondent initiate reevaluation of pesticides where

21 there is evidence showing the likelihood of adverse wildlife impacts due to contamination, to

22 make findings that support its decision, and to consult with DFW as part of its decision-making

23 process. See Food & Ag. Code § 12824; 3 Cal. Code Reg. §§ 6215, 6220, 6222(a); 6252.

24 5. Petitioner seeks a writ of mandate directing Respondent to set aside its determination to

25 renew registration of these rodenticides without a reevaluation.

26 II. PARTIES

1 IV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

2 A. RENEWAL OF PESTICIDE REGISTRATIONS BY THE DEPARTMENT OF
PESTICIDE REGULATION
3
24. Respondent Department of Pesticide Regulation is the state agency vested with the
4
responsibility and jurisdiction over the registration of pesticides in California. Food & Ag. Code §
5 11454. California's registration period for pesticides is 12 months, at which time the registrant must
6 apply for renewal. Food & Ag. Code § 12817. For each pesticide, Respondent must determine
7
whether renewal is appropriate in light of a number of factors, which are the same evaluation criteria
used for initial registration. Food & Ag. Code §§ 12824, 12825. As part of its decision-making
process, Respondent must consult with agencies having jurisdiction over the resources potentially
10 affected by pesticide use. See 3 Cal. Code Reg. § 6252.
11
25. Respondent must reevaluate a registered pesticide when it has received information indicating
12 a pesticide is likely to cause a significant adverse impact, or when there is any alternative that may
13 significantly reduce an adverse environmental impact. 3 Cal. Code Reg. § 6220. Respondent must
14 also a reevaluate a registered pesticide whenever certain factors have been found such as, but not
15 limited to: environmental contamination; fish or wildlife hazard; other information suggesting a
16 significant adverse risk; or availability of an effective and feasible alternative material or procedure
17 which is demonstrably less destructive to the environment. 3 Cal. Code Reg. § 6221.
18
26. If Respondent makes a decision to renew a pesticide registration without reevaluation, the
19
Respondent director must make a written finding that he or she has not received sufficient information
20
necessitating reevaluation pursuant to sections 6220 and 6221. 3 Cal. Code Reg. § 6215(c.)
21
27. If the Respondent director obtains information from the public indicating possible adverse
22
effects from the use of a pesticide, the director shall respond in writing to all significant adverse
23 environmental points raised and the reason for the decision either to reevaluate or not reevaluate the
24
pesticide registration. 3 Cal. Code Reg. §§ 6222(b), 6254(b).
25
B. RESPONDENT'S PESTICIDE REGISTRATION AND RENEWAL PROGRAMIS A
26 CERTIFIED REGULATORY PROGRAM UNDER CEQA

27 28. On December 28, 1979, the California Resources Agency approved the state's pesticide

28 registration process as a certified regulatory a. program under CEQA. Pub. Res. Code § 21080.5(g);

4
Petitioner's Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No.

Pesticide Action Network North America v. Department of Pesticide Regulation (2017) 16 Cal. App.

2 5th 224, 238-243; 14 Cal. Code Reg.§ 15251(i)(1.)

3 29. As a certified regulatory program, the pesticide registration process must comply with the
general policy goals of CEQA. See § 21080.5(c); Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish & Game

5 Commission (1997) 16 Cal. 4th 105, 114; Sierra Club v. State Board of Forestry (1994) 7th Cal.4th

6 1215, 1230-1231. This includes CEQA directives that an agency conduct environmental review when

7 there is the potential for significant impacts from a project approval, consult with trustee agencies

8 over the environmental impacts of a proposed project, consider the cumulative impacts of its project

9 approvals, provide timely and adequate responses to comments made by the public, and consider

10 feasible alternatives to the proposed action. Pub. Res. Code § 21080.5; Azusa Land Reclamation Co.

11 V. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997) 52 Cal. App.4th 1165, 1192; Friends of Old Trees

12 V. Dept. of Forestry and Fire Protection (1997) 52 Cal. App. 4th 1383, 1404-1405; Dunn-Edwards

13 Corp. V. Southcoast Air Quality Management District (1993) 19 Cal. App. 4th 519, 534; EPIC v.

14 Johnson (1985) 170 Cal. App. 3d 604, 625.

15 .30. Since the pesticide registration program includes Respondent's program for deciding whether

16 to annually renew existing pesticide registrations, Respondent's decisions whether to renew pesticide

17 registrations are included in the regulatory program certified by the Secretary of Resources under

18 CEQA. See also 3 Cal. 3 Code Regs. §§ 6252-6255.

19 31. A decision by Respondent to renew a pesticide registration is a "project" under CEQA because

20 the decision grants a license to pesticide manufacturers and users to sell and apply potentially harmful

21 chemicals in California. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21083; 21002; 21065(c); 14 Cal. Code Reg. § 15378(c.)

22 32. In addition, Respondent has the authority to deny or modify a pesticide registration in response

23 to a renewal application. Food & Ag. Code § 12824. Thus, Respondent's decision-making authority

24 over renewal applications is "discretionary" and therefore subject to CEQA. Pub. Res. Code §

25 21080(a); Friends of Westwood, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1987) 191 Cal. App.3d 259, 267, 269.

26 33. CEQA and the Food and Agriculture Code require Respondent to assess and identify the

27 potential environmental impacts arising from its proposed decision to renew pesticides. Food and Ag.

28 Code § 12824 ("All pesticides for which renewal of registration is sought also shall be evaluated in

5
Petitioner's Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No.

1 accordance with this section"); Pub. Res. Code § 21080.5(d)(2)(A); (agency must assess whether

2 activities may have significant adverse effects on the environment); Sierra Club v. State Board of

3 Forestry, supra, 7 Cal.4th at 1228 (agencies operating under a certified regulatory programs must

4 assess the potential for significant environmental impacts at the time of project approval.)

5 34. In renewing pesticide registrations, Respondent must also comply with CEQA requirements

6 that an agency provide the public with notice and the opportunity to review and comment on proposed

7 actions with the potential for significant environmental impacts, and to review and respond to public

8 comments prior to making any decision. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21080.5(d)(2),(3); EPIC v. Johnson,

9 supra, 170 Cal. App. 3d at 627-28; Gallegos v. State Bd. of Forestry (1978) 76 Cal. App. 3d 945,

10 952-55. Respondent must also consider submitted information prior to renewing pesticide

11 registrations without reevaluation and convey to the public an accurate description of the agency's

12 decision-making process. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21080.5(d)(2)(C); 21080.5(d)(3); 21002, 21003.1(a);

13 Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of California (1988) 47 Cal. 3d 376, 391;

14 Schoen V. Department of Forestry & Fire Protection (1997) 58 Cal. App. 4th 556, 563.

15 C. RESPONDENT'S PRIOR RODENTICIDE REEVALUATION.

16 35. In 2013, Respondent completed a Second Generation Anticoagulant Rodenticide Assessment

17 (*2013 Risk Assessment"), which concluded:

18 DPR analyzed wildlife incident and mortality data between 1995 and 2011, and rodenticide

19 use and sales data between 2006 and 2010. The data indicate that exposure and toxicity to non-target wildlife from second generation anticoagulant rodenticides is a statewide problem. In addition, the data suggest that the problem exists in both urban and rural areas. Research
20 data from various locations throughout California indicate that exposure is occurring in many
taxa and in various ecosystems (urban, suburban, rural, and natural/wild areas). ....Of the 492
21 animals analyzed between 1995 and 2011, approximately 73% had residues of at least one second generation anticoagulant rodenticide ...The data also show that exposure of wildlife
22 to second generation anticoagulant rodenticides can lead to sub-lethal effects. The sub-lethal effects reduce the fitness of wildlife at a time when wildlife are already meeting numerous
23 challenges. Riley et al's (2007) study of bobcats is an example of the sub-lethal effects of rodenticides. The bobcats died due notoedric (sic) mange. Mange was not previously known
24 as a significant pathogen in wild felids. However, exposure to rodenticides appears to have contributed to the disease process, and hence, the mortality of the bobcats..
25 Based on this data, Respondent found that "the use of second generation rodenticides presents a
26 hazard related to persistent residues in target animals resulting in impacts to non-target wildlife."
27
36. The 2013 Risk Assessment states that "[w]hile the data show exposure, they do not link
28 specific uses, or location of use of second generation anticoagulant rodenticide (i.e., indoors or

6
Petitioner's Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No.

1 outdoors, homeowners or professionals) to exposure." Nonetheless, Respondent made a

2 determination that the banning of consumer applications of these rodenticides could potentially avoid

3 the continued adverse effects on wildlife. On July 1, 2014, Respondent adopted new regulations that

4 restricted the purchase, possession, and use of rodenticide baits that contain the active ingredients

5 brodifacoum, bromadialone, difenacoum, and difethialone.

6 37. The 2014 regulatory amendment limited the purchase, possession, and use of the four second

7 generation rodenticides (also known by the acronym "SGAR") to certified pesticide applicators and

8 those under their direct supervision. Respondent's notices stated that it "adopted these regulations

9 due to overwhelming evidence of wildlife weakened or killed by SGARs" but that "[o]ther categories

10 of rodenticides - the 1 st-generation anticoagulants, acute toxicants, and certain burrow fumigants

11 are still available to consumers." At the time of this notice, Respondent stated:

12 DPR expects that trained certified applicators will exercise caution and fulfill their professional responsibilities when using SGARs and use them only when necessary. Once
13 applicators are certified, they're required to take continuing education courses that include instruction about using rodenticides safely and only when necessary. If DPR continues to
14 receive reports of nontarget wildlife being adversely impacted by SGARs, further regulatory action may be considered.
15

16 D. RESPONDENT'S RENEWAL OF RODENTICIDE REGISTRATIONS WITH
POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACTS ON NON-TARGET
17 WILDLIFE.

18 38. On November 17, 2017, Respondent issued a public notice entitled "NOTICE OF

19 PROPOSED DECISION TO RENEW PESTICIDE PRODUCT REGISTRATIONS FOR 2018." The

20 notice states: "This is a proposed decision to renew Certificates of Registration of pesticide products

21 registered with DPR that will expire on December 31,2017." The notice also states that "[t]he annual

22 renewal of Certificates of Registration is a non-discretionary duty that must be taken if certain

23 requirements, as described in the regulatory framework below, are satisfied by the registrant." The

24 notice includes a proposed finding by the Respondent director stating:

25 At this point in time, the Director finds, for all pesticide products proposed for renewal that are not currently under reevaluation and are not under consideration for reevaluation,
26 sufficient information has not been received necessitating the reevaluation or initiation of the cancellation process. This proposed action to renew Certificates of Registration of pesticide
27 products currently registered in California maintains the status quo and will not cause either a direct or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment that
28 constitutes a significant adverse environmental effect, and as a result, no alternatives or
mitigation measures are proposed. Based on the findings made above, the Director

7
Petitioner's Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No.

1 determines the renewal of pesticide product registrations for the calendar year 2018 should proceed in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations and no additional products
2 need to be placed into reevaluation or the cancellation process initiated.

3 The notice invites public comment on Respondent's proposed decision by December 22, 2017.

4 39. On December 22, 2017, Petitioner submitted comments on Respondent's proposal to renew

5 without reevaluation pesticide registrations for the seven rodenticides, brodifacoum, bromadiolone,

6 difethialone, difenacoum, diphacinone, chlorophacinone and warfarin for the year 2018. Petitioner's

7 comments stated that continued use of these rodenticides was causing and would continue to cause

8 significant adverse impacts to non-target wildlife through ingestion of poisoned target rodent species.

9 Petitioner's comments included evidence gathered over the last four years consisting of incident

10 reports in which numerous non-target wildlife species have been poisoned as well as more recent

11 scientific studies showing that 1) poisoning of non-target wildlife by second generation rodenticides

12 was continuing despite their restricted use status; and 2) poisoning of non-target wildlife by first

13 generation rodenticides diphacinone, chlorophacinone and warfarin still available for normal

14 consumer use presented a significant threat, particularly due to sub-lethal impacts leading to

15 debilitating diseases such as mange.

16 40. In support of its comments, on December 22, 2017 and thereafter, Petitioners submitted a

17 number of studies substantiating the significant threat posed by first and second generation

18 rodenticides on wildlife species in California.

19 41. Petitioner's comments requested that Respondent initiate reevaluation pursuant to state

20 regulations and CEQA in order to assess the significance of these continued rodenticide poisonings

21 of non-target wildlife and the feasibility of alternative or mitigation measures that would avoid or

22 substantially lessen these impacts.

23 42. On or about December 31, 2017, Respondent renewed all current pesticide registrations for

24 further use in 2018, including registrations for the seven rodenticides. Respondent treated this

25 renewal as a ministerial (non-discretionary) decision and did not post any notice of the decision with

26 the Secretary of Resources. At this time, Respondent did not make a determination whether

27 reevaluation of the seven rodenticides identified in Petitioner's comments was warranted.

28 43. From January to March 2018, Petitioner submitted additional newly published scientific

8
Petitioner's Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No.

1 studies showing that the continued use of the seven rodenticides was having a significant adverse

2 impacts on non-target wildlife, including species of special concern and species listed under the

3 federal and state Endangered Species Acts.

4 44. On March 17, 2018, Petitioner sent an email to Respondent requesting that Respondent, in

5 considering and evaluating Petitioner's comments to initiate reevaluation for the seven rodenticides,

6 consider and analyze the monitoring data produced since 2014 in order "to continuously evaluate the

7 impact of SGAR use and take additional steps, if necessary," and to determine whether the continued

8 use of rodenticides requires "appropriate regulatory action."

9 45. On March 19, 2018, Respondent sent a letter a to Petitioner's counsel, stating that "DPR is

10 proceeding with the renewal of [the seven rodenticides] and will not be placing them into reevaluation

11 at this time." Respondent's letter does not provide any response to the monitoring data or studies

12 submitted in support of Petitioner's comments. Instead, the letter states that "DPR will continue to

13 evaluate available information to determine if additional mitigation measures are needed to

14 adequately protect non-target wildlife. If at any point DPR concludes that there are additional studies

15 that registrants could conduct on the impact of anticoagulant rodenticide use on non-target wildlife

16 in order to determine the need and extent of further regulatory action to address these concerns, DPR

17 may utilize its formal reevaluation process."

18 46. On April 18, 2018, Respondent issued a "Final Decision Regarding Renewal of Registration

19 of Pesticide Products for 2018," which repeated Respondent's prior decision that "DPR is proceeding

20 with the renewal of FGARs and SGARs and will not be placing them into reevaluation at this time."

21 47. On May 16, 2018, Respondent's "Final Decision Regarding Renewal of Registration of

22 Pesticide Products for 20183 was filed with the Secretary of Resources.

23 48. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to the filing of this petition by raising each

24 and every issue known to it regarding the impacts of rodenticide contamination on non-target wildlife,

25 and by requesting reevaluation at the time of Respondent's proposed renewal of pesticide products

26 containing these rodenticides that contribute to this contamination, in compliance with Public

27 Resources Code § 21177, during the public comment period for Respondent's pesticide registration

28 renewal.

14 significantly reduce adverse environmental impacts. 3 Cal. Code Reg. § 6220.
15
61. In renewing, without reevaluation, Rodenticides for 2018, Respondent abused its discretion
16
and acted contrary to law by failing to consider and evaluate monitoring information and scientific
17 studies that were reasonably obtainable and necessary to determine whether the continued registration 18
and use of this pesticide will have significant adverse environmental impacts. 3 Cal. Code Reg. §
19
6222(a).
20
62. In renewing, without reevaluation, Rodenticides for 2018, Respondent abused its discretion
21
and acted contrary to law by failing to respond to comments adequately, including providing : written 22 evaluation of any significant adverse environmental point raised during the review process. 3 Cal.
23
Code Reg. §§ 6222(b); 6254(b).
24
63. In renewing, without reevaluation, Rodenticides for 2018, Respondent abused its discretion

Community v. County of Los Angeles ("Topanga") (1974) 11 Cal. 3d 506. 27
62.
28 In renewing the Rodenticides for 2018 without reevaluation Respondent acted arbitrarily and
capriciously and failed to proceed in the manner required by law. Respondent's actions, therefore,

7 make a new decision in light of the Court's ruling on this petition; and to file a return with the Court

8 showing compliance with the writ of mandate.

9 2. For injunctive relief restricting use of the Rodenticides pending the completion of

10 Respondent's evaluation and satisfaction of the Court's writ of mandate;
