PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. This action challenges the decision of the County of San Diego and its Board of

3 Supervisors ("Respondents") to certify the Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for and adopt the
4 Newland Sierra Specific Plan and associated approvals (the "Project"). The Project, which includes an
5 amendment of the County's General Plan, proposes the development of over 2,100 residential units on a

6 1,985-acre site in unincorporated San Diego County north of the cities of San Marcos and Escondido.

7 2. Petitioners CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY and ENDANGERED

8 HABITATS LEAGUE (collectively, "Petitioners") file this action seeking to require the County of San
9 Diego to set aside certain approvals and entitlements the County granted in violation of its statutory duty
10 to not approve this environmentally-damaging Project without analyzing the Project's impacts and
11 adopting all feasible mitigation for such harm. Specifically, Petitioners seek a Writ of Mandate ordering
12 the Respondents to set aside all approvals and entitlements for the Project until the County has fully
13 complied with the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code sections
14 21000, et seq., State Planning and Zoning Law, the County's General Plan and local ordinances, and
15 other applicable laws and regulations. Petitioners also seek a judicial declaration establishing the
16 County's duties for compliance with its General Plan and State Planning and Zoning Law.
17 THE PARTIES

18 3. Petitioner CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY (the "Center") is a non-profit
19 conservation organization dedicated to the protection of native species and their habitats through
20 science, policy, and environmental law. The Center has approximately 68,000 members worldwide,
21 including residents of San Diego County. The Center has worked for many years to protect imperiled
22 plants and wildlife, open space, air and water quality, and the overall quality of life for people in both
23 unincorporated and incorporated parts of the County. Members of the Center objected to the approval
24 and construction of the Project and will be directly and adversely affected by the Project.

25 4. Petitioner Endangered Habitats League ("EHL") is a tax-exempt non-profit California
26 corporation dedicated to the conservation of native ecosystems and to sustainable land use and
27 transportation planning. Since 1991, EHL has engaged in planning partnerships across Southern

28
2
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

California and worked to create habitat preserve systems, now threatened by climate change. EHL is
2 extremely active in the San Diego region, where many of its members live and enjoy the biological

3 diversity in the area. EHL served on the advisory committee for the San Diego County 2011 General
4 Plan Update. Members of EHL objected to the approval and construction of the Project and will be
5 directly and adversely affected by the Project.

6 5. Members of the Center and EHL have environmental, educational, recreational,
scientific, and aesthetic interests in the Project area and its wildlife and plant communities. These

8 interests will be directly and adversely affected by the Project, which violates provisions of law as set
forth in this Petition and which would cause irreversible harm to the natural environment and its
10 recreational assets. The Center and EHL and their members have a direct and beneficial interest in
11 Respondents' compliance with CEQA and California Code of Regulations, title 14, section 15000 et seq.
12 ("CEQA Guidelines"), State Planning and Zoning Law, and the County's General Plan. The
13 maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a substantial benefit on the public by protecting
14 the public from the environmental and other harms alleged herein.
15 6. Respondent COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO (the "County"), a political subdivision of the
16 State of California, is responsible for regulating and controlling land use in its territory, including
17 implementing and complying with the provisions of CEQA, State Planning and Zoning Law, and the
18 County's General Plan. The County is the "lead agency" for the purposes of Public Resources Code
19 Section 21067, with principal responsibility for conducting environmental review of the proposed
20 actions and complying with CEQA and other state laws.
21 7. Respondent BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OF THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO (the
22 "Board") is the elected decisionmaking body of the County. As the decisionmaking body, the Board is
23 charged with the responsibilities under CEQA for conducting a proper review of the proposed action's
24 environmental impacts and granting the various approvals necessary for the Project.
25 8. Real Party in Interest NEWLAND SIERRA, LLC ("Newland Sierra") is identified as one
26 of the two Project applicants in the County's September 27, 2018 Notice of Determination (*NOD") for
27 the Project.

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

9. Real Party in Interest RITA BRANDIN is identified as the second of two Project
2 applicants in the County's September 27, 2018 NOD for the Project. Petitioners are informed and

3 believe that Ms. Brandin is Newland's Chief Executive Officer.

10. Petitioners do not know the true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate,

5 associate, or otherwise, of respondents DOES 1 through 20, inclusive, and therefore sue said
respondents under fictitious names. Petitioners will amend this Petition to show their true names and
capacities when the same have been ascertained. Each of the respondents is the agent and/or employee

8 of Respondents, and each performed acts on which this action is based within the course and scope of
9 such Respondents' agency and/or employment.

10 11. Petitioners do not know the true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate,

11 associate, or otherwise, of real parties in interest DOES 21 through 40, inclusive, and therefore sue said
12 real parties in interest under fictitious names. Petitioners will amend this Petition to show their true

13 names and capacities when the same have been ascertained.
14 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

15 12. This Court has jurisdiction to issue a Writ of Mandate to set aside Respondents' decision
16 to approve the Project under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 (alternatively section
17 1085) and Public Resources Code sections 21168.5 (alternatively 21168) and 21168.9.

18 13. Venue for this action properly lies in the San Diego County Superior Court because
19 Respondents and the proposed site of the Project are located in the County.

20 14. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
21 21167.5 by serving written notices of Petitioners' intention to commence this action on Respondents on
22 October 24, 2018. A copy of the written notices and proof of service are attached hereto as Exhibit A.

23 15. Petitioners are complying with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
24 21167.6 by notifying Respondents of Petitioners' election to prepare the record of administrative
25 proceedings relating to this action. A copy of the election to prepare the record of administrative
26 proceedings is attached hereto as Exhibit B.

Y

16. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
2 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 by furnishing the Attorney General of the State of

3 California with a copy of the Petition on October 25, 2018. A copy of the letter transmitting the Petition
4 to the Attorney General attached hereto as Exhibit C.

5 17. Each Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this instant

6 action and has exhausted any and all administrative remedies to the extent required by law, including,

7 but not limited to, submitting extensive written and oral commentseither jointly and individually-

8 objecting to the approval of the Project and presenting to Respondents the flaws in its environmental
9 review.

10 18. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
11 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside certification of
12 the EIR and approval of the Project. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' approval will remain
13 in effect in violation of state law.

14 19. This petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167
15 and CEQA Guidelines section 15112.
16 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

17 20. Petitioners challenge the decision of Respondents to approve the Project based upon a
18 legally inadequate EIR, and inadequate findings of fact and statement of overriding considerations,
19 violations of State Planning and Zoning Law, and the County's General Plan and zoning regulations.
20 The Proposed Project

21 21. The Project is located on 1,985 acres of unincorporated San Diego County in the rural
22 Twin Oaks Valley north of the cities of San Marcos and Escondido. Prior to the County's action, the
23 Project site was designated as Rural and Semi-Rural, allowing no more than 100 residential units. The
24 Project would transform the mostly undeveloped site with a sprawling development that will include
25 2,135 residential housing units and 81,000 square feet of commercial uses.
26 22. The Project will introduce over 5,700 new residents to a region already burdened by
27 heavy commuter traffic on and around the I-15 freeway. The Project site is a in a Very High Severity Fire
28
5
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Hazard Zone, putting new residents at risk while making a potential evacuation by existing area

2 residents nearly infeasible.

3 23. The undeveloped Project site contains sparse dirt roads and trails that provide access to
4 existing parcels, as well as existing water infrastructure such as transmission lines, tanks, and a portion
5 of the San Diego County Water Authority ("SDCWA") aqueduct. Surrounding land uses include single

6 family and semi-rural residential development.

7 24. The Project is located within the northern portion of the Merriam Mountains, which
8 provide high-quality wildlife habitat that is largely undeveloped. The Project area is located within the
9 area covered by the draft North County Multiple Species Conservation Program ("MSCP"). The MSCP
10 is a broad conservation planning program designed to protect native ecosystems for imperiled San Diego
11| County wildlife and site compatible development.

12 25. The Project will permanently impact over 15 acres of wetlands and wetland buffers,
13 harming numerous special status plant and wildlife species specially adapted to rapidly declining
14 riparian habitats.
15 26. The Project site contains 706 acres of designated critical habitat for the federally
16 threatened coastal California gnatcatcher. This habitat supports nesting and foraging behaviors, as well
17 as providing connectivity and genetic interchange between otherwise isolated populations.

18 27. Construction of the Project will fragment core habitat for wildlife, disrupting resident
19 species as well as species, such as mountain lions and bobcats, reliant on the area as a movement
20 corridor between core habitat in the Merriam and San Marcos Mountains.

21 28. The Project site contains 22 vegetation communities, including native, non-native and
22 other land cover types. Over 90% of the Project site is undisturbed chaparral (1,804 acres), with areas of
23 coastal sage scrub scattered throughout the chaparral, covering approximately 4% (80 acres) of the site.
24 The site also contains 9.1 acres of coast live oak woodland, considered special-status vegetation
25 community by the County of San Diego.
26 29. The Project area's natural topography consists of hills and valleys defined by rock
27 outcroppings and moderate to steep slopes. The elevation on the Project site ranges from 660 feet above
28
6
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

19

r mean sea level to approximately 1,750 feet above mean sea level. Due to the unsuitability of this

2 landscape for development, construction of the Project would require grading on 504 acres, hillside-

3 removal amounting to over 10 million cubic yards of cut and fill.

4 30. The Project poses significant threats to ecological resources and human health, risks that
5 have been omitted or insufficiently analyzed in the Respondents' environmental review. The Project will

6 potentially impose negative impacts to the area's biological resources, water supply, air quality,
7 greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions, traffic, and wildfire risk, among other impacts.

8 Greenhouse Gas Emissions

9 31. The County is already subject to a Writ issued on May 4, 2015 by the San Diego Superior
10| Court, Hon. Timothy Taylor presiding, in Case number 37-2012-00101054-CU-TT-CTL, Sierra Club, et
11 al. v County of San Diego. That Writ was issued following remand after the Court of Appeal's opinion
12 in Sierra Club v. County of San Diego (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 1152 affirmed Judge Timothy Taylor's
13 ruling that the County's previous Climate Action Plan ("CAP") was not adopted in the manner required
14 by law in that it "fail[ed] to incorporate mitigation measures into the CAP as required by Public
15 Resources Code section 21081.6." (Id. at 1167-68.) The Writ commanded the County to set aside its
16 Climate Action Plan adopted in June 2012, to prepare a new Climate Action Plan to reduce greenhouse
17 gases in the County (hereinafter "Revised CAP"), and to comply fully with CEQA and any and all other
18 applicable laws.

19 32. On February 14, 2018, the County adopted its Revised CAP, which was promptly
20 challenged by Petitioners and numerous other environmental and community groups for failing to
21 comply with this Court's Writ, in that the Revised CAP does not contain fully enforceable and
22 additional (in excess of what would happen absent the activity to create offsets) measures to mitigate the
23 significant adverse effects on the environment of the County's adoption of the 2011 General Plan
24 Update ("GPU").

25 33. Importantly, it has failed to carry out Mitigation Measure CC-1.2 set out in the Program
26 Environmental Impact Report for the GPU. Mitigation Measure CC-1.2 required the adoption by the
27 County of a CAP that would achieve specified reductions in the emissions of greenhouse gases GHGs

28
7
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

r from County operations and community emissions in the County by the year 2020. Mitigation Measure
2 CC-1.2 of the County's General Plan Update requires the County to:
w Prepare a County Climate Change Action Plan with an update[d] baseline inventory of greenhouse gas emissions from all sources, more detailed greenhouse gas emissions reductions targets and deadlines; and a
5 comprehensive and enforceable GHG emissions reduction measures that will achieve : 17% reduction in emissions from County operations from

6 2006 by 2020 and a 9% reduction in community emissions between 2006 and 2020.

34. Despite the requirement in the GPU that GHG emissions reductions be made within the

9 County (Mitigation Measure CC-1.2), the County adopted Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1 within the

10 CAP's Supplemental EIR, which allows GHG emissions within the County to rise, if they are

11 purportedly compensated for ("offset") by GHG emissions reductions outside the County, outside the

12 state of California, and even on other continents.

13 35. Although transportation is responsible for about 45% of the GHG emissions in the

14 County, and although the County's General Plan, including, for example, the Conservation and Open

15 Space Element, encourages and supports land use development patterns and transportation choices that

16 reduce pollutants and greenhouse gases, the County has thus far approved four large residential

17 development projects in the County's rural back-country areas, including Newland Sierra.

36.
18 The construction of these development projects in locations far from transit and urban

19 services and amenities will cause increased driving and its attendant GHG emissions. These projects

20 were never contemplated or analyzed as future projects or the future direction of growth by the 2011

GPU.
21
37.
22 In addition to the Projects' inconsistency with the County's own General Plan, it is also

23 inconsistent with the GHG reduction provisions of the region-wide Regional Transportation Plan and

24 Sustainable Communities Strategy prepared by the San Diego Association of Governments

25 (SANDAG"), which is designed to reduce GHG emissions associated with driving. There was no

26 discussion of this inconsistency in the Projects' EIR.

27 38. The County's approvals allow Newland Sierra to mitigate the climate-changing impacts

28 of the GHG emissions it will cause by obtaining off-site GHG emissions offsets. These offsets are not

8
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

4%

P required to be obtained in San Diego County, as the mitigation for the GPU EIR provides, but may be

2 obtained anywhere in the world at the discretion of the County's Director of Planning and Development

3 Services ("PDS"). Verification of the amount and the efficacy of these offsets need be shown only "to

4 the satisfaction" of the Director of PDS, without written or duly adopted standards for determining such
5 satisfaction. Obtaining offsets outside of San Diego County violates Mitigation Measure CC-1.2 adopted

6 for the GPU, which requires in-County GHG reductions. In addition, the failure to obtain GHG offsets

7 within the County has other environmental impacts, in that the reductions in conventional air pollutants
8 and the additional jobs that GHG offset projects would produce will not be realized by County residents,
9 but by residents outside the County, and likely outside the United States.

10 Administrative History of the Project

11 39. On or about February 12, 2015, the County issued a Notice of Preparation for the Project,
12 notifying public agencies and interested individuals that, as lead agency, it would it be preparing a Draft
13 EIR to analyze the Project's potentially significant environmental impacts.

14 40. On or about June 15, 2017, the County released its Draft EIR for the Project, which had
15 changed substantially from the version of the Project submitted to the County in 2015. Despite multiple
16 requests from members of the public for an extended review period to consider the nearly 22,000-page
17 document, the County provided the public only 60 days to review and comment on the Draft EIR.
18 41. The County received extensive public comments, including from the Petitioners, raising
19 concerns about the Project's environmental impacts and the analytical defects of the County's
20 environmental review. Comments were received from concerned San Diego residents, organizations and
21 businesses, as well as state and regional government agencies.
22 42. On or about June 18, 2018, the County released the Final EIR, which included text
23 changes to the Draft EIR and responses to public comments on the Draft EIR. Despite numerous
24 comments from the Petitioners and other concerned stakeholders highlighting Draft EIR deficiencies,
25 the Final EIR and its responses to comments failed to properly disclose or analyze the Project's impacts.
26 43. Following the FEIR's release and shortly before the Project approval, the County
27 released new environmental analyses purporting address key environmental impacts for the Project,
28
9
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

including water supply impacts and oak tree loss. The County failed to adequately circulate these
2 changes to the public and responsible agencies for review and comment.

44. On September 26, 2018, the Board of Supervisors, at the recommendation of the Planning
Commission, certified the Final EIR and granted all necessary approvals for the Project. In doing so, the
5 Board of Supervisors disregarded the recommendation of three of its Community Sponsor Groups--the
Twin Oaks Valley Community Sponsor Group, the Bonsall Community Sponsor Group, and the Hidden
Meadows Community Sponsor Group-all of which unanimously recommended denial of the Project.

8 45. On September 27, 2018, the County filed a "Notice of Determination" for the Project
9 stating that the Board had approved the Project, even though an ordinance approved as part of the
10 Project had not yet undergone a second reading as required by California law.

11 46. Petitioners have exhausted all administrative remedies by submitting written comments to
12 the County prior to the Project's approval and appearing at the public hearings on the Project to request
13 compliance with CEQA, State Planning and Zoning Law, and the County's General Plan, and the
14 completion of full and adequate environmental review. All issues raised in this Petition were raised
15 before Respondents by Petitioners, other members of the public, or public agencies prior to approval of
16 the Project.

17 47. Respondents have abused their discretion and failed to proceed in a manner required by
18 law in the following ways:

19 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

20 Violation of CEQA - Inadequate EIR

21 (Public Resources Code § 21000, et seq.)

22 48. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above.

23 49. CEQA is intended to ensure that long-term protection of the environment be the guiding
24 criterion in public decisions. To effectuate this policy, a lead agency must prepare a legally adequate
25 EIR prior to approving any discretionary project that may have a significant environmental effect. The
26 EIR must fully disclose and analyze the project's potentially significant environmental effects. The lead
27 agency is also required pursuant to CEQA to consider mitigation measures and alternatives that would

28 10
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 reduce or avoid the project's significant environmental effects, to adopt all feasible mitigation measures
2 and/or alternatives, and to determine that proposed mitigation measures will or will not be effective in
3 avoiding or substantially lessening the project's significant environmental impacts.

4 50. In approving the Project and certifying the EIR, CEQA requires that the lead agency must
5 find either (1) that the project's significant environmental effects have been mitigated or avoided or (2)
6 that the unmitigated impacts are outweighed by specific overriding economic, legal, social,
7 technological, or other benefits of the project. The lead agency may reach the latter conclusion and adopt
8 a Statement of Overriding Considerations only if it finds that there are no feasible mitigation measures

9 or alternatives to avoid or substantially lessen the remaining significant environmental effects of the
10 project.
11 51. An EIR must provide a complete and accurate description of both the project and the
12 project's environmental setting.

13 52. The EIR must provide sufficient environmental analysis such that decision-makers can
14  intelligently consider environmental consequences when acting on proposed projects. Mitigation
15 measures adopted for a project's significant environmental effects must be concrete and enforceable.
16 53. CEQA requires that substantial evidence in the administrative record support all of the
17 EIR and agency's findings and conclusions, and that the agency explain how the evidence in the record
18 supports the conclusions the agency has reached.
19 54. As lead agency, the County has a clear, present, and mandatory duty to analyze and adopt
20 all feasible mitigation measures as well as consider a reasonable range of alternatives and adopt any
21 feasible alternative that would substantially lessen the significant environmental effects of the Project.

22 55. Respondents violated CEQA by certifying an EIR for the Project that is inadequate and
23 fails to comply with CEQA for the following reasons, among others:

24 56. Environmental Setting. The EIR fails to comply with CEQA's requirements to provide
25 an adequate and accurate description of the environmental setting of the Project area. (CEQA Guidelines
26 § 15125.) The EIR's description of the environmental setting is inadequate because, but not limited to,
27 its failure to adequately disclose the Project a area's importance as a habitat corridor and linkage for
28
11
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

wildlife; establish that adequate protocol-level surveys were performed on all appropriate species; and
2 disclose the results of all biological surveys conducted on the Project site.

57. Project Description. The EIR does not contain a legally adequate Project description
4 because it does not accurately describe the whole of the action, including Interstate 15 interchange

5 capacity improvements that are an integral part of the Project.

6 58. Biological Resources. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and mitigate the
7 Project's significant direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts to wildlife, including federally-protected
8 species, such as the California gnatcatcher, and state and federal species of special concern.

59. The EIR understates the Project's effects on California gnatcatcher by discounting areas

10 on the Project site that are suitable for gnatcatcher habitat or that provide connectivity between other
11 gnatcatcher populations.

12 60. The EIR does not adequately disclose, analyze, and mitigate the Project's impacts on
13 areas designated as critical habitat for the California gnatcatcher, although the Project site contains
14 approximately 706 acres of designated gnatcatcher critical habitat. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
15 designated this area as critical habitat because it "contains all of the features essential to the conservation
16 of the coastal California gnatcatcher" and "provides for connectivity and genetic interchange among
17 core populations and contains large blocks of high-quality habitat capable of supporting persistent
18 populations of coastal California gnatcatchers."

19 61. Mitigation measures proposed in the EIR and adopted by the County to address impacts

20 to California gnatcatchers and their habitat are inadequate and improperly deferred. The preservation of
21 some parts of the Project site, including 25.2 acres of coastal sage scrub, is insufficient to compensate

22 for the net loss of approximately 685 acres of occupied or suitable gnatcatcher nesting or foraging
23 habitat, some or all of which is designated gnatcatcher critical habitat, that will occur with construction
24 of the Project. Avoidance of a small part of the Project site does not qualify as mitigation for this net
25 loss under CEQA. To the extent the County relies on the proposed acquisition of a 212-acre off-site
26 parcel in Ramona for mitigation of the Project's gnatcatcher and associated habitat impacts, the off-site
27

28 12
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F mitigation site is unsuitable for gnatcatchers habitat, for facilitating gnatcatcher movement or dispersal,

2 or for promoting gnatcatcher recovery.

3 62. The EIR fails to disclose and analyze the Project's potential to impair the recovery of
4 federally-protected species, including the California gnatcatcher. By appropriating areas essential for the
5 gnatcatcher's recovery for development, the Project undermines the feasibility of the MSCP, and saddles

6 other property owners and future projects with a disproportionate burden for recovering the gnatcatcher.

7 63. The EIR also fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and mitigate the Project's significant

8 direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts to protected, special status, and rare plants and plant
9 communities, including the Ramona horkelia, Orcutt's brodiaea, Munz's sage, summer holly, rainbow
10 Manzanita, Engelmann oak, chaparral rein orchid, and ashy spike-moss. Mitigation proposed for
11| protected, special status, and rare plants is improperly deferred. Mitigation proposed for direct impacts
12 to Ramona horkelia, which would be entirely eliminated from the Project site, is inadequate because it
13 relies on relocation that has a very low probability of success, and fails to identify sufficient mitigation
14 acreage, the relocation sites, or the terms of their management.
15 64. Mitigation measures proposed in the EIR and adopted by the County for the Project's
16 impacts to Resource Protection Ordinance ("RPO") wetlands do not achieve the mitigation ratios
17 required by the RPO: By exempting the Project from the RPO, Respondents have failed to adopt
18 adequate mitigation for wetlands and other sensitive resources. Additionally, both the County's RPO
19 and the MSCP were mitigation measures adopted for the County's 2011 General Plan. Yet the EIR fails
20 to analyze the Project's inconsistency with these mitigation measures.
21 65. The EIR's disclosure, analysis, and mitigation of the Project's impacts on wildlife
22 movement are inadequate. The EIR's analysis of wildlife movement impacts relies on an inaccurate and
23 incomplete assessment of existing conditions, which yields a distorted and inadequate baseline for
24 environmental review. The residual wildlife movement corridors that would remain after Project
25 construction are functionally inadequate, and reflect a net, but unacknowledged loss of regional wildlife
26 movement functionality.

27

28
13
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

66. The EIR's disclosure, analysis, and mitigation of the Project's impacts on contiguous

2 habitat areas are inadequate. The EIR fails to consider the Project's "edge effects" impacting
surrounding onsite and offsite areas.

67. Water Supply. The EIR does not adequately disclose, analyze and/or mitigate the
environmental consequences of supplying the Project with water. The EIR does not accurately describe

6 the baseline conditions relevant to analyzing the Project's water supply impacts, and improperly

7 conflates existing conditions with development that is hypothetically allowed under the existing General

8 Plan, resulting in a substantial underestimate of the Project's true water supply impacts. The EIR also
9 based its water supply analysis on simplified demand model that likely understates the Project's actual
10 water consumption, and fails to adequately analyze the Project's cumulative impacts in light of the

11 projected water supply deficit for the Project area.
12 68. Traffic. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze and/or mitigate the Project's
13 significant direct, indirect, and cumulative traffic impacts, including the impacts associated with
14 completing the Interstate 15 interchange improvements required for the Project.

15 69. Fire Safety. Although the Project site is located in an area designated by the California
16 Department of Forestry and Fire a Protection as a Very High Severity Fire Hazard Zone, Respondents
17 failed to adopt feasible mitigation measures and alternatives that would reduce or avoid the Project's fire
18 safety impacts. Among other things, the Respondents failed to fully consider the likelihood that the
19 Project would increase the chance of wildfires while simultaneously impairing evacuation routes for
20 existing residents.

21 70. Cumulative Impacts. The EIR does not adequately disclose, analyze, or mitigate the
22 Project's significant cumulative impacts. From the outset, the EIR failed to consider the full scope of
23 recently-approved or pending development projects within the County and neighboring jurisdictions that
24 would together create significant environmental impacts.

25 71. Among other impacts, these projects, when taken together, would have significant
26 cumulative impacts related to inconsistencies with San Diego's Air Quality Plan. The Project, together
27 with just six other planned projects, would be inconsistent with the RAQs for San Diego County because

28 14
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F they would result in more intense land uses and increased vehicle miles traveled. These cumulative

2 projects, if taken together as CEQA requires, would result in VOC emissions that exceed San Diego Air
3 pollution Control District thresholds of significant by more than 2,000%. Yet the EIR did not consider
4 these cumulative impacts, much less mitigate them or make findings justifying Project approval in light

5 of them.

6 72. The cumulative wildfire impacts of the Project together with the other projects were also
7 ignored. Increasing the risk and intensity of wildfires not only impacts human health and safety, it also
8 impacts critical habitat for endangered and sensitive species.

73. By developing sprawling residential developments far from public transit and job centers,

10 all of these cumulative projects also contribute significantly to transportation-related energy
11 consumption. The Project's EIR failed to quantify either the increase in vehicle miles traveled (*VMT")
12 caused by these projects or transportation-related energy consumption on a cumulative basis. Based on
13 evidence in the record, these cumulative projects would cause VMT to increase by 644,739 miles every
14 day, or over 235 million new VMT per year. This is an astonishing impact that must have been, but was
15 not, analyzed as a potentially significant cumulative impact.
16 74. The EIR also failed to consider the cumulative impacts related to inconsistency with the
17 General Plan's Community Development Model and numerous policies in the Land Use and Housing
18 Elements. Nor did the EIR consider the cumulative impacts related to consistency with SANDAG's
19 Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy, or the approved or proposed Multiple
20 Species Conservation Plans.
21 75. Consistency with Applicable Plans and Policies. The EIR fails to disclose, analyze,
22 disclose, or mitigate the significant impacts associated with the Project's inconsistency with the
23 County's General Plan, the MSCP, the Vallecitos Water District's Urban Water Management Plan, and
24 the SANDAG Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy.
25 76. For example, the Project site is a core habitat area or Pre-Approved Mitigation Area
26 (PAMA) in the draft North County MSCP. The Project would develop or fragment approximately two-
27 thirds of this core habitat area, leaving behind severely diminished species populations and ecological
28
15
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

functions and values in an area that is currently highly valued as a biological preserve. In doing so, the
Project would undermine the preserve-design principles of the North County MSCP.

77. Alternatives. The EIR fails to provide a selection and discussion of alternatives that
4 foster informed decision-making and informed public participation. The alternatives analysis in the EIR

5 does not meet the requirement of a reasonable range of alternatives that lessen the Project's significant
6 environmental impacts, and does not focus on alternatives that either eliminate adverse impacts or

7 reduce them to insignificance, even if they would to some degree impede the Project's objectives, as

8 required by CEQA. The alternatives analysis fails to consider feasible reduced-footprint alternatives,
9 including alternatives proposed by wildlife agencies, and feasible off-site alternatives to the Project. The
10 EIR's alternatives analysis also misled the public and decisionmakers by comparing the Project to
11 purportedly more impactful alternatives that were legally or physically impractical to build.
12 78. Responses to Comments. The responses to comments in the Final EIR fail to meet
13 CEQA's requirements in that they neither adequately dispose of all the issues raised, nor provide
14 specific rationale for rejecting suggested Project changes, mitigation measures, or alternatives. CEQA
15 requires that the lead agency evaluate and respond to all environmental comments on the Draft EIR that
16 it receives during the public review period. The responses must describe the disposition of the issues
17 raised and must specifically explain reasons for rejecting suggestions and for proceeding without
18 incorporating the suggestions. The Final EIR's responses to comments fail to satisfy the requirements of
19 law.

20 79. Administrative Record. Respondents violated state and local law, including Public
21 Resources Code section 21167.6(e) and County Board of Supervisors Resolution 17-170 and Policy A-
22 129, by failing to retain all records necessary for complete administrative record in CEQA action.
23 Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that, throughout the administrative process

24 for the Project, the County deleted records related to the Project that were required to be included in the
25 administrative record for this case

26 80. Based upon each of the foregoing reasons, the EIR is legally defective and Respondents
27 have failed to comply with CEQA's procedural requirements. Respondents prejudicially abused their

28 16
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F discretion in violation of CEQA in approving the Project. As such, the Court should issue writ of
2 mandate directing Respondents to set aside the certification of the EIR and approval of the Project.

3 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

4 Violation of CEQA - Inadequate Statement of Overriding Considerations and Findings

5 (Public Resources Code § 21000, et seq.)

6 81. Respondents' Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations violate the

7 requirements of the CEQA Guidelines. The Findings fail to identify the changes or alterations that are
8 required to avoid or substantially lessen the project's significant environmental effects (CEQA

9 Guidelines § 15091(a)(1). The purported benefits of the Project cited in the Statement of Overriding
10 Considerations do not outweigh the substantial costs of the Project on public health and the
11 environment. The Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations are not supported by substantial
12 evidence. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15091(b).)
13 82. Where mitigation measures and alternatives to a project are not adopted, the CEQA
14 findings must identify specific economic, legal, social and technological and other considerations that
15 make infeasible the adoption of mitigation measures or alternatives. All CEQA findings must be
16 supported by substantial evidence in the record and must disclose the analytical route by which approval
17 of the Project is justified. The findings regarding the impacts, mitigation measures, and alternatives
18 relied upon by Respondents' approval of the Project are not supported by substantial evidence in the
19 record, and the links between evidence and conclusions are not satisfactorily provided.
20 83. Respondents' Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations fail to reflect
21 the independent judgment of Respondents.

22 84. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents did not proceed in the manner required
23 by law, and their decision to approve the Project was not supported by substantial evidence.
24 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

25 Violation of CEQA - Failure to Recirculate EIR
26 (Public Resources Code § 21000, et seq.)
27 85. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above.
28
17
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

86. CEQA requires that if significant new information is added to an EIR after a draft EIR is
2 prepared, but before certification of the final EIR, an amended EIR must be recirculated for public

3 review and comment.

4 87. The Draft EIR relies on the use of GHG offset credits to reduce the Project's climate
5 change impacts, including the permissible use of offsets of GHG emissions outside of San Diego County
6 as mitigation for Project emissions. The measures regarding the use of offset credits track those in the
7 County's Climate Action Plan, which is subject to a pending legal challenge in San Diego County
8 Superior Court Case Number 37-2018-00013324-CU-TT-CTL. On September 14, 2018, the court in that
9 case issued an order prohibiting the County from using the new Climate Action Plan GHG offset
10 proposals for approvals of pending General Plan amendments until the court's final judgment in that
11 case or further order of the Court of Appeal.

12 88. The Project here includes a General Plan amendment and relies on GHG offset measures
13 that are equivalent to the enjoined Climate Action Plan measures. The September 14, 2018 order
14 fundamentally alters the EIR's analysis and mitigation of the Project's GHG impacts.

15 89. Despite the addition of significant new information in the Final EIR, including but not
16 limited to the stay and injunction effected by the September 14, 2018 order, Respondents failed to
17 recirculate the EIR or any portion of the EIR as required CEQA, nor did Respondents update the text of
18 the Final EIR to reflect the effects of the stay and injunction. As a result of Respondents' failure to
19 recirculate the EIR, the public and other public agencies were deprived of any meaningful opportunity to
20 review and comment on the new information, including new information indicating that the EIR's
21 analysis and mitigation of the Project's GHG impacts is inadequate.
22 90. By failing to amend and recirculate the EIR, Respondents failed to proceed in the manner
23 required by law, and their decision to approve the Project was not supported by substantial evidence.
24 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

25 Violation of CEQA - Failure to Analyze and Mitigate GHG Impacts

26 (Public Resources Code §§ 21002 and 21081, CEQA Guidelines § 15126.4)
27 91. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above.

28
18
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

92. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze and/or mitigate the Project's significant and

2 cumulative impacts due to increased emissions of GHGs. The Project, when combined with other

3 cumulative projects in the County and neighboring jurisdictions, would emit hundreds of thousands of
4 metric tons of CO2 equivalent per year.

5 93. The Project authorizes the use of offsets from outside the County of San Diego. The EIR
6 identifies the County's "priority" list for consideration of GHG reduction features as follows:
7 1) project design features/on-site reduction measures; 2) off-site within the
8 unincorporated areas of the County of San Diego; 3) off-site within the County of San Diego; 4) off-site within the State of California; 5) off-site
9 within the United States; and 6) off-site internationally.

10 94. CEQA, at Public Resources Code section 21002, provides that "public agencies should
11 not approve projects as proposed if there are feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures
12 available which would substantially lessen the significant environmental effects of such projects. . .." In
13 addition, Public Resources Code section 21081 provides that "no public agency shall approve or carry
14| out a project for which an environmental impact report has been certified which identifies one or more

15 significant effects on the environment that would occur if the project is approved or carried out unless"
16 either the public agency makes findings that changes or alterations to the project have been made that
17 would mitigate or avoid such significant effects, or the public agency adopts a Statement of Overriding
18 Consideration that such significant effects are outweighed by specified economic, social, or other
19 benefits of the project. (Pub. Res. Code section 21081, subds. (a), (b).) Such findings must be supported
20 by substantial evidence. (Pub. Res. Code section 21081.5.)
21 95. The County's approval of Newland Sierra violates Public Resources Code sections 21002
22 and 21081 in that GHG emissions from the Project may have significant cumulative impacts on the
23 environment by contributing to climate change in California and elsewhere, and such significant effects
24 have not been adequately mitigated. The County, in certifying the EIR for the Project and approving the
25 Project, relied on the option of providing off-site and out-of-County reductions in GHG emissions that
26 are not legally adequate to serve as mitigation for GHG emissions from each Project, in that the off-site
27 emissions reductions are not real, permanent, quantifiable, verifiable, and enforceable reductions as set
28
19
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 forth in Health and Safety Code Section 38562(d)(1), are not additional to any other requirement of law

2 or regulation (CEQA Guidelines section 15126.4(c)(3)), and lack legally-required performance

3 standards.

4 96. The County left the determination of the adequacy of off-site, out-of-County GHG
5 emissions reductions to fully offset the GHG emissions of the Project to the discretion of the Director of

6 Planning and Development Services, with no regulations or procedures established by which the

7 Director should make such determination. Without established, defined, and scientifically supported
8 criteria for approving offset registries and offset programs, off-site offsets may be approved by the
9 Director that will not actually reduce GHG emissions, or that may not reduce them to the degree claimed
10 | in the Project's EIR.

11 97. CEQA is a statute intended to "protect[] informed self-government" (Laurel Heights
12 Improvement Assn. v. Regents of the University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392) and "to
13 demonstrate to an apprehensive citizenry that the agency has, in fact, analyzed and considered the
14 ecological implications of its action." (No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 86.)
15 Without duly adopted, publicly available criteria in place under which the Director of Planning and
16 Development Services will make the determination as to the validity of off-site GHG reduction registries
17 and programs, the "apprehensive citizenry" of San Diego will not be able to know whether the County
18 has approved projects that have significant environmental impacts that have not been adequately
19 mitigated, in violation of CEQA's purposes of full environmental disclosure and public accountability.

20 98. The County's approval of Newland Sierra violates Public Resources Code sections 21002
21 and 21081, and CEQA Guidelines sections 15126 and 15126.2, in that the EIR fails to analyze, disclose,

22 and if necessary, provide adequate mitigation for, the impacts resulting from the inconsistency of each
23 Project with County Land Use Element Policy CC-1.2, which requires specified GHG reductions within
24 the County, given that each Project relies on the ability to use out-of-County GHG offsets.
25 99. The EIR also relies on "Project design features" without adequately demonstrating that
26 these features will yield the claimed emissions reductions.
27

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

100.

2 In each of the respects enumerated above, Respondent County of San Diego has violated
its duties under the law, abused its discretion, failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and
3 decided the matters complained of without the support of substantial evidence, all in violation of CEQA.

4

5 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

6 Violation of California Planning and Zoning Law

J 101. (Government Code § 65300, et seq.)

8 102. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above.
The California Planning and Zoning Law requires the legislative body of each county to
9 adopt a general plan for the physical development of the county. State law provides that the County's
a 10 General Plan is a fundamental land use planning document and serves as the constitution for future
11 development within the County.
12 103. Government Code section 65030.1 directs that decisions about growth "should be guided
13 by an effective planning process, including the local general plan." Government Code section 65300.5
14 requires that the local general plan be "integrated, internally consistent and compatible." Land use
15 actions, including the approvals associated with the Project, also must be consistent with the General
16 Plan.

17 104. The Project is inconsistent with numerous mandatory General Plan policies, including,
18 but not limited to, (a) policies within the Conservation and Open Space Element, including Policies
19 COs-1.2, COS-1.3, cOs-1.4, COS-2.2, COS-3.1, COS-7.4, COS-8.1, and COS-20.1; (b) policies within
20 the Land Use Element, including Policies LU-1.1, LU-1.2, LU-1.3, LU-1.4, LU-5.1, LU-5.3, LU-6.9,
21 LU-6.10, LU-6.11, and CC-1.2; and (c) policies within the Safety Element, including Policies S-1.1, S-
22 2.6, and S-3.5.

23 105. In addition to other inconsistencies, the Project is fundamentally inconsistent with the
24 Community Development land use model at the core of the County's General Plan. The Project
25 constitutes a leapfrog development that would disturb lands far from existing villages, in violation of the
26 Community Development model.

27

28
21
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

106. Another major goal of the General Plan is to create a housing stock at a range of prices
2 (Goal H-1), especially in order to meet the County's Regional Housing Needs Assessment allocations

3 for lower income households. The Housing Element recognizes that one of the most promising

4 mechanisms for achieving this goal is by requiring large-scale residential developers to provide
affordable housing. For this reason, Policy H-1.9 "[r]equires developers to provide an affordable

6 housing component when requesting a General Plan amendment for a large-scale residential project

7 when this is legally permissible." The Project is a large-scale residential project that requires a General
| Plan amendment, but fails to provide any affordable housing component, in violation of the General

9 Plan's affordable housing goals and Policy H-1.9.

10 107. In addition, Project-related General Plan Amendments have rendered the General Plan
11 internally inconsistent with other elements of the existing General Plan.
12 108. Government Code § 65358(b) limits the number of times per calendar year that a city or
13 county may amend any mandatory General Plan element. That limit is currently four. Mandatory San
14 Diego County General Plan elements include: the Land Use Element, Mobility Element, Conservation
15 and Open Space Element, Housing Element, Safety Element and Noise Element.
16 109. Prior to approval of the Project, the County had already amended the Land Use Element
17 four times in 2018, for the Lake Jennings Marketplace, Harmony Grove Village South, Valiano. and
18 Otay 250 projects. The County amended the General Plan's Land Use Element for a fifth time, in
19 violation of Section 65358(b), when it approved the Project.

20 110. SB 1000 also requires the County to adopt an "environmental justice element, or the
21 environmental justice goals, policies, and objectives in other elements" in 2018 after it amends two or

22 more elements of its General Plan. The County has amended its General Plan more than twice in 2018,

23 but it has failed to adopt an environmental justice element or environmental goals and policies in its

24 General Plan. Until it does so, the County lacks a legally adequate General Plan. Thus, the County's

25 approval of the Project in reliance on the General Plan is unlawful.
26 111. Additionally, the County may not approve the Project until it adopts a legally-adequate
27 CAP, and the Project is inconsistent with the County's existing CAP.

28 22
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 112. Other Project approvals, including changes to the Project site's zoning classification and

2 exemption from the RPO, are inconsistent with these mandatory General Plan policies and render the
3 Project inconsistent with the General Plan.

4 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

5 Declaratory Relief

Violation of General Plan 6

113. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above.
c 114. An actual and immediate controversy has arisen and now exists regarding the legality of
9 the Respondents' action in approving multiple General Plan amendments ("GPAs") to allow greater
10 densities than permitted by the General Plan in areas that are designated by the General Plan for rural or
11 low-density development.

12 115. Respondents are required to follow the law including but not limited to the requirement
13 that the County must have an internally consistent General Plan and must not approve projects or zoning
14 changes that are inconsistent with General Plan policies.
15 116. The 2011 General Plan adopted a "Community Development Model" to govern
16 development in the County. In this model, designated "Villages" would be the only areas of the County
17 with dense residential neighborhoods, commercial and civic uses, and networks of roads, bike lanes, and
18 walkways. These "Villages" are then be surrounded by semi-rural areas with low-density residential
19 neighborhoods, small-scale agricultural operations, and rural commercial businesses. The semi-rural
20 areas are then surrounded by rural lands with very low density residential areas, open space, habitat,
21 recreation, agriculture, and other rural uses.
22 117. This "environmentally sustainable approach to planning" was carefully crafted to achieve
23 numerous 2011 General Plan goals, including reduced vehicle miles traveled, reduced greenhouse gas
24 emissions, improved transportation, and the preservation of "each unique community with[in] the
25 County, agricultural areas, and extensive open space."
26 118. Key to this "Community Development Model" was the County's commitment not to
27 allow dense residential development outside of existing villages.

28
23
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

119. Yet, in 2018, the County has already adopted numerous General Plan amendments,
2 including the amendments authorizing the development of the Harmony Grove Village South, Valiano,
3 Otay 250, and Newland Sierra projects, to allow multiple projects to exceed allowable densities and to
4 permit development in areas designated by the General Plan for rural or low-density development.
Furthermore, the is County is currently processing numerous other GPA applications that will allow

6 additional residential development projects to exceed allowable densities and to develop suburban
7 housing projects in rural or low-density areas of the County. For example, the County plans to "bundle"
8 forty-one separate General Plan amendments (called the "Property Specific Requests") for consideration
9 by the Board of Supervisors at one time. These amendments would also allow development that was not

10 studied or permitted under the 2011 General Plan. These projects are anticipated to be considered by the
11 Board of Supervisors in 2018.

12 120. By approving multiple General Plan Amendments that allow higher density residential
13 development in areas that are designated by the General Plan for limited growth or rural uses, the
14 County has created, and will create, an internally inconsistent General Plan. On the one hand, the core
15 General Plan principle, and numerous General Plan policies, impose strict limitations on where dense
16 development can occur. On the other hand, the County is continually undermining those limitations by
17 approving amendment after amendment allowing dense development outside of designated "Villages."

18 121. These amendments also compromised the ability of the County to meet other General
19 Plan requirements such as those related to the reduction of GHGs, transportation management, and
20 affordable housing. There is no substantial evidence that the County can meet its own General Plan
21 requirements when it has approved, or will approve, multiple residential projects that substantially
22 deviate from the density allowances of the General Plan and that will involve growth in areas assumed
23 by the General Plan to be for rural or low-density development.

24 122. The County has further failed to adopt an "environmental justice element, or"
25 "environmental justice goals, policies, and objectives in other elements" in compliance with SB 1000
26 before approving multiple General Plan Amendments in 2018. Petitioners are informed and believe, and

27

28 24
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

on that basis allege, that the County has no plans to amend its General Plan to conform the SB 1000's

2 requirements before approving additional developments requiring General Plan amendments.

3 123. A judicial declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time in order that the parties

4 ascertain their rights and obligations with respect to the adoption of GPAs.

5 124. Therefore, Petitioners seek a declaration that Respondents' action in approving the

6 numerous GPAs for dense development outside of the "Villages" designated in the 2011 General Plan,
7 creates an internal inconsistency in the General Plan, is an abuse of discretion, or otherwise fails to
8 comply with the law.

125. Petitioners seek an additional declaration that Respondents' action in approving the
10 numerous GPAs without first complying with SB 1000, is an abuse of discretion, or otherwise fails to
11 comply with the law.

12 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

13 Violation of County Zoning Ordinance

14 126. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above.
15 127. Section 7507 of the County's Zoning Ordinance requires that the Planning Commission
16 consider "any modification of" a requested amendment to the Zoning Ordinance before Respondent
17 Board of Supervisors adopts the proposed amendment.
18 128. Respondents violated section 7507 of the Zoning Ordinance when the Board of
19 Supervisors adopted an amendment to the RPO to exempt the Project without first allowing the Planning
20 Commission to consider the adopted version of the amendment.
21 129. Respondent also violated the RPO, as amended. because there is no substantial evidence
22 to support the determination that the Resources Protection Plan prepared for the Project is "the
23 functional equivalent" to the protections otherwise provided by the RPO.
24 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

25 Arbitrary and Capricious Administrative Action; Improper Spot Zoning
26 (Code Civil Procedure § § 1085, 1094.5)
27 130. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above.
28
25
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 131. The amended RPO created a special exemption from resource protection requirements

2 applicable only to the Newland property, without any rational basis for treating that property differently

3 than other, similarly situated properties in the County.

4 132. The amended RPO conditioned the Newland exception on a finding that the Project

5 includes a Resource Protection Plan ("RPP") that provides the "functional equivalent" of the RPO
6 requirements, but the final ordinance amending the RPO was revised to include a determination that the
7 proposed RPP is the functional equivalent of RPO requirements.

8 133. Unlike the RPO, the RPP requires insufficient avoidance and compensatory mitigation

9 for the significant loss of gnatcatcher habitat, wetlands, and wetlands buffer arcas resulting from the
10 Project. Substantial evidence in the record establishes that the RPP is not the functional equivalent of the
11 RPO, there is no substantial evidence in the record to support a contrary determination.
12 134. The RPO exemption imbedded a quasi-adjudicative determination in a legislative action,
13 without making any of the findings required by state law, and is arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of
14 discretion, and unsupported by substantial evidence.
15 135. In addition, the County's adoption of the RPO special exemption is void as an arbitrary
16 exercise of the legislative power that bears on reasonable relation to the public welfare, and as an
17 instance of improper spot zoning that confers special benefits to the Newland property owner without an
18 evidentiary showing that the public interest warrants such treatment.

19 136. As result of the foregoing defects, Respondents did not proceed in the manner required
20 by law, and their decision to approve the Project was not supported by substantial evidence.
21 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as follows:

22 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

23 1. For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent
24 injunctions restraining Respondents and Real Parties in Interest and their agents, servants, and
