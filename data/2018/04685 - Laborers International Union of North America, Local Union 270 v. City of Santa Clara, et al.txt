27 (hereinafter "Petitioner") petitions this Court for a writ of mandate directed to Respondents and

28 Defendants City of Santa Clara, City Council for the City of Santa Clara, Planning Commission of
the City of Santa Clara, and Architectural Committee of the City of Santa Clara (collectively
1

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 "Respondents" or "City") and Real Parties in Interest PR III 2305 Mission College Boulevard, LLC,

2 Clarke Michalak, and PR III 2305 Mission College ("Real Parties," "PR III 2305 Mission College

3 Boulevard" or "Applicant"), and by this verified petition and complaint, alleges as follows:

4 1. Petitioner brings this action to challenge the unlawful actions of Respondents in

5 approving the 2305 Mission College Boulevard Data Center Project ("Project") without first

U preparing an Environmentai impact Report ("EiR") in accordance with tne requirements of tne

7 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq., and the

8 CEQA Guidelines, title 14, California Code of Regulations, § 15000 et seq. The specific actions
9 challenged are: (1) the adoption of Resolution No. 18-8582 adopting the Mitigated Negative

10 Declaration ("IS/MND") and the Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program for the Project; and

11 (2) the adoption of Resolution No. 18-8583 approving the Project.

12 2. The Project includes the demolition of an existing 358,000 square foot office building

13 and parking lot located at 2305 Mission College Boulevard in the City of Santa Clara and the

14 subsequent construction and operation of a 495,610 square foot data center building. The data center

15 building would house computer servers for private clients and would be designed to provide 60

16 megawatts of information technology power. Standby backup emergency electrical generators would

17 be installed to provide for an uninterrupted power supply. A total of 120 625-kW diesel-fueled engine

18 generators would be located within a generator yard west of the data center building. The generators

19 would provide 75 MW of backup power generation capacity. Additionally, the site will also construct

20 a 90-megavolt amp electrical substation on-site and 75 parking stalls.

21 3. The City is in violation of CEQA by failing to prepare an EIR for the Project despite

22 substantial evidence in the record of a fair argument that the Project may have significant and

23 unmitigated air quality impacts associated with the construction of the Project, including significant

24 impacts from the Project's construction emissions of nitrogen oxide (NO%) and particulate matter

25 (PM2.5 and PM10).

26 4. Petitioner and others submitted evidence presenting a fair argument that the proposed

27 Project may have significant air quality impacts and that the IS/MND's air emissions analysis is not

28 supported by substantial evidence because (1) the air modeling the analysis relies upon to estimate

2

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 NOx emissions during construction underestimates and is inconsistent with the schedule of

2 construction and equipment operation provided by the Applicant, (2) the analysis fails to factor in

3 emissions of particulate matter from wind erosion and off-road travel of heavy trucks on unpaved

4 surfaces during construction at the site, and (3) expert analysis of the Project's construction emissions

5 of NOx, PM10 and PM2.5 demonstrates that the Project's construction emissions of these pollutants

0 may exceed threshoids of signiticance establisned by California air districts.

7 5. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion in adopting the IS/MND and failing

8 to prepare an EIR. Alternatively, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by relying upon

9 an IS/MND that is not supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, the Resolutions approving the

10 IS/MND and approving the Project should be set aside and the City should be required to prepare an

11 EIR and fully comply with CEQA prior to considering whether to approve the Project.

12 PARTIES

13 6. Petitioner LABORERS INTERNATIONAL UNION OF NORTH AMERICA,

14 LOCAL UNION 270 ("LIUNA") is a labor organization that has approximately 3,240 members

15 residing in the County of Santa Clara. Local 270 has more than 100 members who live in the City of

16 Santa Clara. Local 270's purposes include advocating on behalf of its members to ensure safe

17 workplace environments; working to protect recreational opportunities for its members to improve its

18 members' quality of life when off the job; advocating to assure its members access to safe, healthful,

19 productive, and aesthetically and culturally pleasing surroundings on and off the job; promoting
20 environmentally sustainable businesses and development projects on behalf of its members, including

21 providing comments raising environmental concerns and benefits on proposed development projects;

22 advocating for changes to proposed development projects that will help to achieve a balance between

23 employment, the human population, and resource use to permit high standards of living and a wide

24 sharing of life's amenities by its members as well as the general public; advocating for steps to

25 preserve important historic, cultural, and natural aspects of our national heritage, and maintain,

26 wherever possible, an environment that supports diversity and variety of individual choice;

27 advocating on behalf of its members for programs, policies, and development projects that promote

28 not only good jobs but also a healthy natural environment and working environment, including

3

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

advocating for changes to proposed projects and policies that, if adopted, would reduce air, soil, and

2 water pollution, minimize harm to wildlife, conserve wild places, reduce traffic congestion, reduce

3 global warming impacts, and assure compliance with applicable land use ordinances; and working to

4 attain the widest range of beneficial uses of the environment without degradation, risk to health or

5 safety, or other undesirable or unintended consequences.

cognizable interests in the Project. Local 270 members live, work, and recreate in the City of Santa

8 Clara. Local 270 members may also be exposed to construction and operational hazards from air
pollution emissions on the Project site that have not been adequately analyzed or mitigated. The

10 interests of Local 270 and its members.are unique and will be directly impacted by the Project.

11 Petitioner brings this action on behalf of itself, its members, and the public interest.

12 8. Local 270 and its members have a direct and beneficial interest in Respondents'

13 compliance with laws bearing upon approval of the Project. These interests will be directly and

14 adversely affected by the Project, which violates the law as set forth in this Petition. The maintenance

15 and prosecution of this action will confer a substantial benefit on the public by protecting the public

16 from the environmental and other harms alleged below and others that may exist but are unknown

17 due to the lack of a full environmental analysis. Local 270 and its members submitted written and

18 oral comments to the City's Architectural Committee, Planning Commission, and City Council
19  objecting to and commenting on the Project and its unsupported and inadequate environmental

20 review pursuant to CEQA.

28

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

LEGAL BACKGROUND

2 23. CEQA has two primary purposes. First, CEQA is designed to inform decision makers

3 and the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of a project. (14 Cal. Code Regs.

4 ("CEQA Guidelines") § 15002(a)(1)). Second, CEQA requires public agencies to avoid or reduce
5 environmental damage when "feasible" by requiring "environmentally superior" alternatives and all

, feusibie mitgation measures. (CEQA Guidelines § 15002(a)(2) andi (3)).

7 24. CEQA requires that an agency analyze the potential environmental impacts of its

8 proposed actions in an EIR except in certain limited circumstances. (See Pub. Resources Code, §
9 21100.) The EIR is the very heart of CEQA. (Bakersfield Citizens for Local Control v. City of

10 Bakersfield (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1184, 1214; Pocket Protectors v. City of Sacramento (2004) 124

11 Cal.App.4th 903, 927.) The EIR is an "environmental 'alarm bell' whose purpose is to alert the

12 public and its responsible officials to environmental changes before they have reached the ecological

13 points of no return." (Bakersfield Citizens, 124 Cal.App.4th at 1220.) The EIR also functions as a

14 "document of accountability," intended to "demonstrate to an apprehensive citizenry that the agency

15 has, in fact, analyzed and considered the ecological implications of its action." (Laurel Heights
16 Improvements Assn. v. Regents of University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392.) The EIR

17 process "protects not only the environment but also informed self-government." (Pocket Protectors,

18 124 Cal.App.4th at 927.)

19 25. An EIR is required if "there is substantial evidence, in light of the whole record before

20 the lead agency, that the project may have significant effect on the environment." (Pub. Resources
21 Code, § 21080(d); see also Pocket Protectors, 124 Cal.App.4th at 927.) This evidentiary standard is

22 generally referred to as the "fair argument" standard.

23 26. "Significant environmental effect" is defined very broadly as "a substantial or
24 || potentially substantial adverse change in the environment." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21068; see also

25 CEQA Guidelines, § 15382.) An effect on the environment need not be "momentous" to meet the

26 CEQA test for significance; it is enough that the impacts are "not trivial." (No Oil, Inc. V. City of Los

27 Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 83.)

28

7

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 27. Under the "fair argument" standard, an EIR is required if any substantial evidence in

2 the record indicates that a project may have an adverse environmental effect-even if contrary

3 evidence exists to support the agency's decision. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15064(f)(1); Pocket

4 Protectors, 124 Cal.App.4th at 931; Stanislaus Audubon Society v. County of Stanislaus (1995) 33

5 Cal.App.4th 144, 150-15; Quail Botanical Gardens Found., Inc. V. City of Encinitas (1994) 29

u Cai.App.4th 1597, i602.) The "fair argument" standard creates a "low threshoid" favoring

7 environmental review through an EIR rather than through issuance of negative declarations or notices

8 of exemption from CEQA. (Pocket Protectors, 124 Cal.App.4th at 928.) "[I]t is a question of law,

9 not fact, whether a fair argument exists, and the courts owe no deference to the lead agency's

10 determination. Review is de novo, with preference for resolving doubts in favor of environmental

11 review." (Pocket Protectors, 124 Cal.App.4th at 928.)

12 28. "[U]nder CEQA, the lead agency bears a burden to investigate potential environmental

13 impacts. 'If the local agency has failed to study an area of possible environmental impact, a fair

14 argument may be based on the limited facts in the record. Deficiencies in the record may actually

15 enlarge the scope of fair argument by lending a logical plausibility to a wider a range of inferences.'
16 (Sundstrom v. County of Mendocino (1988) 202 Cal. App. 3d 296, 311. County Sanitation Dist. No. 2

17 V. County of Kern (2005) 127 Cal. App. 4th 1544.)

18 29. In limited circumstances, an agency may avoid preparing an EIR by issuing a negative

19 declaration but only if there is not even a "fair argument" that the project will have a significant

20 environmental effect. (14 Cal. Code Regs., § 15371 ["CEQA Guidelines"]; Pub. Resources Code, §§

21 21100, 21064.) Since "[t]he adoption of a negative declaration has a terminal effect on the
22 environmental review process," by allowing the agency "to dispense with the duty [to prepare an

23 EIR]," negative declarations are allowed only in cases where "the proposed project will not affect the

24 environment at all." (Citizens of Lake Murray v. San Diego (1989) 129 Cal.App.3d 436, 440.) A

25 mitigated negative declaration is proper only if the project revisions would avoid or mitigate the

26 potentially significant effects identified in the initial study "to a point where clearly no significant

27 effect on the environment would occur, and…..there is no substantial evidence in light of the whole

28 record before the public agency that the project, as revised, may have a significant effect on the

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

environment." (Pub. Resources Code §§ 21064.5 and 21080(c)(2); Mejia v. City of Los Angeles

2 (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 322, 331.) In that context, "may" means a reasonable possibility of a
significant effect on the environment. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21082.2(a), 21100, 21151(a); Pocket

4 Protectors, 124 Cal.App.4th at 927; League for Protection of Oakland's etc. Historic Resources v.
City of Oakland (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 896, 904-905.)

6 30. As mattei of iaw, "subsiantai evidence inciuces . . . experi opinion." (Pub.

7 Resources Code, § 21080(e)(1); CEQA Guidelines, § 15064(f)(5).) CEQA Guidelines demand that

8 where experts have presented conflicting evidence on the extent of the environmental effects of a

9 project, the agency must consider the environmental effects to be significant and prepare an EIR.

10 (CEQA Guidelines § 15064(f)(5); Pub. Res. Code § 21080(e)(1); Pocket Protectors, 124 Cal.App.4th

11 at 935.)

12 STATEMENT OF FACTS

13 31. The Project is proposed to be located on a 15.7 acre site located at 2305 Mission

14 College Boulevard. Currently, the site contains a 358,000 square feet office building. The Project

15 includes demolition of the existing building and construction and operation of a 495,610 square foot

16 data center building with equipment yards and onsite improvements. The southwest corner of the

17 Project will consist of a generator yard consisting of 120 625-kW diesel-fueled engine generators. 24

18 10,000 gallon above ground diesel fuel tanks would be located beneath the generators. A large

19 equipment yard will be located on the north edge of the project site. An electrical substation will be

20 constructed in the northwest corner of the site.

21 32. The Project's demolition and construction activities would extend for about 15

22 months. The Project conditions authorize construction to occur from 7 a.m. until 6 p.m. each

23 weekday other than a holiday. Grading and soil disturbance will extend over 15 acres of the site.

24 Approximately 46,000 cubic yards of fill will have to be imported to the site to raise the base

25 elevation by about four feet.

26 33. Construction of the Project includes the operation of a wide variety of heavy

27 machinery, including tractors, dozers, scrapers, cement trucks, excavators, backhoes, cranes and other

28

equipment. This heavy machinery emits NOx when operating. NOx reacts in the atmosphere to create

2 ground-level ozone. US EPA states that ozone has serious adverse health impacts:

3 Ozone in the air we breathe can harm our health. People most at risk from breathing air

4 containing ozone include people with asthma, children, older adults, and people who are active outdoors, especially outdoor workers. In addition, people with certain genetic

10 The Bay Area Air Quality Management District ("BAAQMD") has established a

11 significance threshold of 54 lbs/day of NOx during construction. Based on that threshold, Projects

.12 emitting greater than 54 lbs/day of NO% during construction will have a significant adverse effect on
the environment.
13
35.
14 After factoring in the mitigation measures identified to reduce NOx emissions, the

15 IS/MND states that the Project will emit an average of 51 lbs/day of NOx during construction. This

16 calculation of NOx emissions is based on air emission modeling conducted by the City's consultant

17 using the California Emissions Estimator Model Version CalEEMod.2016.3.1 ("CalEEMod"). The

18 model generates emission levels based on project-specific inputs provided by the applicant. The

19 inputs include the number and type of construction equipment to be used, the schedule and duration

20 of construction for each phase of construction, the size of the project, and other parameters.

36.
21 Expert comments submitted to the City evaluated the inputs used for the Project's
CalEEMod modeling. The comments point out that the construction schedule information used in the
22

23 CalEEMod model is different from the construction schedule identified by the applicant. Expert

24 comments indicate that the duration of various phases of the Project's construction is underestimated

25 by the modeling relied upon by the IS/MND. The date ranges for each construction phase provided

26 by the applicant include more workdays than were input into the CalEEmod modeling relied upon by

27 the IS/MND. As a result, the NOx emissions calculated by the CalEEMod model for the Project are

28 underestimated. Expert comments using inputs more reflective of the Project's actual work days
indicate that the Project's average emissions of NOx during construction will be 57 lbs/day. The
10

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 evidence that the CalEEMod modeling relied upon by the IS/MND employs inputs that are

2 inconsistent with the applicant's construction schedule is substantial evidence of a fair argument that

3 the Project may have significant environmental impacts from NOx emissions. Expert calculations that

4 the Project's average emissions of NOx during construction will exceed the BAAQMD threshold of

5 significance for NOx is substantial evidence of a fair argument that the Project may have significant

5 envirommeniai impacis from NOx emnissions.

7 37. During the Project's construction, dust will be generated by wind and the operation of

8 trucks and equipment on unpaved areas of the site. Dust generated during construction will contain
particulate matter, including PM2.5 and PM10. Haul truck activities will generate fugitive PM2.5 and

10 PM10 emissions when traveling on unpaved areas within the Project site during site preparation and

11 grading. Particulate matter that is smaller than 10 micrometers in diameter poses serious health risks.

12 Small particles can lodge deep within the lungs and even enter the bloodstream. Exposure to

13 particulate matter pollution has been linked to a number of health impacts, including premature death

14 in people with heart or lung disease, heart attacks, aggravated asthma, decreased lung function, and

15 respiratory problems.

16 38. Particulate matter pollution is divided into two categories based on the size of the

17 particles - PM10 and PM2.5. BAAQMD has not established a threshold of significance for

18 construction emissions of PM2.5 or PM10. However, other California air districts have established

19 significance thresholds for construction emissions of PM10 and PM2.5. The Monterey Bay Unified

20 Air Pollution Control District has established a significance threshold of 82 pounds per day for

21 construction PM10 emissions. The South Coast Air Quality Management District has established

22 significance thresholds of 150 pounds per day for PM10 and 55 pounds per day for PM2.5. The

23 Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District has established significance thresholds of

24 80 pounds per day for PM10 and PM2.5 if all feasible control measures are implemented.

25 39. Instead of relying on any of the available thresholds of significance, the IS/MND

26 relies on the Project's implementation of various control measures and assume that such measures

27 will mitigate the Project's PM10 and PM2.5 emissions to levels of insignificance. The IS/MND lists

28 a number of standard measures used to control dust during construction. These include watering

11

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

unpaved surfaces twice per day, covering haul trucks containing soil, cleaning up dirt tracked onto

2 adjacent roadways, limiting truck speeds on site to 15 miles per hour, completing paving and building
pads as soon as possible, installing construction screening around the perimeter of the site, providing
information for the public to report dust complaints, suspending excavation, grading and demolition

5 when wind speeds exceed 20 mph or dust is observed extending beyond the site, installing tree or
fouve wind bieaks along windward side of üne site, avoiding simultaneous ground-disturbing
activities, and installing erosion control measures such as sandbags. The IS/MND concludes that

8 implementation of these standard measures would reduce construction dust impacts to a less than
significant level.

10 40. The CalEEMod model relied upon by the IS/MND does not model fugitive dust

11 emissions from off-road vehicle travel, including on-site haul trucks. Likewise, CalEEMod does not

12 estimate fugitive dust generated by wind over land and storage piles. Expert comments submitted to

13 the City, applying U.S. Environmental Protection Agency emission factors, calculate that the

14 Project's fugitive emissions of PM10 during construction will be 524 to 648 lbs/day of PM10. The

15 expert comments further calculate that the Project will emit 79 to 94 lbs/day of PM10 during grading

16 and site preparation. Each of these emission levels of PM10 and PM2.5 exceeds the thresholds of

17 significance established by various California air districts for fugitive PM2.5 and PM10 construction

18 emissions. Evidence of the limitations of the CalEEMod model and expert calculations of PM2:5 and

19 PM10 emissions is substantial evidence of a fair argument that the Project's emissions of particulate

20 matter may have significant environmental impacts.

21 PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

22 41. On or about March 7, 2017, the applicant submitted an application to the City for the
23 Project.

24 42. From March 5, 2018 through April 12, 2018, the IS/MND for the Project was

25 circulated for public review.

26 43. On March 30, 2018, LIUNA submitted written comments on the IS/MND and the

27 Project.

/

1 44. The morning of April 18, 2018, the City provided responses to comments submitted

2 on the Project's IS/MND. The evening of April 18, 2018, the Architectural Committee held a public

3 meeting on the Project. LIUNA attended and made comments at the meeting. At the conclusion of the

4 meeting, the Architectural Committee adopted the IS/MND and the Mitigation Monitoring and

5 Reporting Program and approved the Project.

5 45. Ou April 24, 2018, LIUNA fiied a umely appeai of the Architeciurai Commiuee's

7 approval of the IS/MND and the Project to the Planning Commission. On April 25, 2018, California

8 Unions for Reliable Energy ("CURE") also filed an appeal of the Architectural Committee's actions.

9 46. On June 12, 2018, LIUNA submitted supplemental comments in response to the City's

10 responses to earlier comments.

11 47. On June 13, 2018, the Planning Commission held a public hearing to consider
12 LIUNA's and CURE's appeals of the Architectural Committee approvals. LIUNA appeared at the

13 Planning Commission hearing. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Planning Commission voted to

14 overrule the appeals and uphold the Architectural Committee's actions.

15 48. On June 20, 2018, LIUNA, as well as CURE, filed timely appeals of the Planning

16 Commission's action.

17 49. On July 17, 2018, the City Council held a hearing to consider LIUNA's and CURE's

18 appeals of the Planning Commission action. LIUNA appeared at the City Council hearing. At the

19 conclusion of the hearing, the City Council voted 5 to 5 1 to deny the appeals. Despite the existence of

20 substantial evidence creating a fair argument that the Project may result in significant adverse
21 environmental impacts, the City Council adopted Resolution No. 18-8582 approving the IS/MND and
22 Mitigation and Monitoring Program. The City Council also adopted Resolution No. 18-8583

23 approving the Project.

24 50. On July 23, 2018, the City filed a Notice of Determination with the Santa Clara

25 County Clerk's office. This action is being filed within 30 days of the posting of the City's Notice of

26 Determination with the Santa County Clerk's office, in accordance with Public Resources Code

27 section 21167(b).

28

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

51. Petitioners exhausted administrative remedies by submitting written and oral

2 comments and expert analysis to the Respondents demonstrating that there is a fair argument that the

3 Project may have adverse environmental impacts and requesting preparation of an EIR to analyze

4 these impacts and to propose feasible mitigation measures. Despite being presented with this

5 substantial evidence, Respondents failed to prepare an EIR.

U 52. Petitioner nas no piain, speedy, or adequate remedy in tne ordinary course ot law

7 within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure: 1094.5 or, alternatively, § 1086, in that

8 Respondents' approval of the Project is not otherwise reviewable in a manner that provides an

9 adequate remedy. Accordingly, Petitioner seeks this Court's review of Respondents' approval of the

10 Project to rectify the violations of CEQA.

11 53. Petitioner is informed and believes that the Real Parties in Interest are threatening to

12 proceed with implementation of the Project in the near future. Implementation of the project will

13 irreparably harm the environment in that the Real Parties will commence with polluting activities

14 without Respondents having prepared an EIR for the Project resulting in air quality impacts to

15 Petitioner and its members. A temporary restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunctions

16 should issue restraining Respondents and Real Parties from proceeding with the Project without first

17 preparing and certifying an EIR analyzing impacts and imposing all feasible mitigation measures.

18 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

19 (Violations of CEQA; Failure to Prepare EIR Despite Fair Argument of Potential
Significant Impacts and IS/MND Not Supported by Substantial Evidence)
20
54.
21 All of the above paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference as if set forth again in
full.
22
55.
23 Respondents failed to comply with CEQA by failing to prepare an EIR for the Project

24 despite substantial evidence in the record of a fair argument that the Project may have one or more

25 significant environmental impacts, including but not limited to the following:

26 a. There is a fair argument that the Project may have significant air pollution impacts

27 because substantial evidence demonstrates that the Project's analysis of

28 construction emissions of NOx relies upon modeling inputs that are inconsistent
with the equipment list and schedule submitted by the applicant and that
14

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

construction emissions of NOx may exceed the BAAQMD threshold of
significance for NOx construction emissions.

b. There is fair argument that the Project may have significant air pollution impacts

Cr because substantial evidence demonstrates that the Project's analysis of
construction emissions of PM2.5 does not address either off-road fugitive dust
emissions or wind fugitive dust emissions and that the Project likely will exceed
CEQA significance thresholds for construction emissions of PM2.5 established by
numerous California air districts.

10 c. There is a fair argument that the Project may have significant air pollution impacts
because substantial evidence demonstrates that the Project's analysis of

12 construction emissions of PM10 does not address either off-road fugitive dust

13 emissions or wind fugitive dust emissions and that the Project likely will exceed

14 CEQA significance thresholds for construction emissions of PM10 established by
numerous California air districts.

15 56.

16 Because a fair argument exists that the Project may have one or more significant

17 environmental impacts, the City must prepare an EIR for the Project to analyze all environmental

18 impacts and to propose all feasible mitigation measures and alternatives to reduce those impacts.
57.

19 Alternatively, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by adopting an

20 IS/MND the construction emission analysis for which is not supported by substantial evidence. The
IS/MND's reliance on inaccurate construction schedule and equipment information in its air
21 modeling for NOx construction emissions is an abuse of discretion. The IS/MND's failure to properly

22

23 address construction emissions of PM2.5 and PM10 resulting from vehicles traveling over unpaved
areas and wind is an abuse of discretion.

24 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

25 (Injunctive and Declaratory Relief Against Respondents and Real Parties in Interest)

26 58. All of the above paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference as if set forth again in

27 full.

28 59. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law. Unless enjoined,
Respondents and Real Parties in Interest will implement the Project despite their lack of compliance
15

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

with CEQA. Petitioner will suffer irreparable harm due to Respondents' failure to take the required

2 steps to protect the environment. Declaratory relief is appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure &
1060, injunctive relief is appropriate under Code of Civil § Procedure § 525 et seq. and a writ of

4 mandate is appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure § 1085 et seq. and 1094.5 et seq. and under

5 Public Resources Code § 21168.9, to prevent irreparable harm to the environment.

6 PRAYER

7 WHEREFORE, Petitioner and Plaintiff prays that the Court:

8 1. Issue a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents to set aside the approvals of
the Project unless and until Respondents have prepared, circulated, and considered a legally adequate
10 CEQA document prior to any subsequent approval action;
11 2. Issue a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents and Real Parties in Interest
12 to suspend all activity in furtherance of the Project unless and until Respondents take all necessary
13 steps to bring their actions into compliance with CEQA;
14
3.
15 Issue a preliminary and permanent injunction staying the effect of Respondents'
approvals of the Project;
16
4.
17 Issue a declaratory judgment declaring Respondents' approvals of the Project to be

18 null and void and contrary to law;

19 S. Award costs of suit;

20 6. Award attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure $1021.5 and any other

21 applicable provisions of law; and

22 7. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Page 2 of 3

Council of the City of Santa Clara, Planning Commission of the City of Santa Clara, and the
Architectural Design Review Committee of the City of Santa Clara ("Respondents") in the
Superior Court for the County of Santa Clara, challenging the July 17, 2018 decision of Respondent City Council of the City of Santa Clara to approve the Project and the accompanying
mitigated negative declaration and mitigation and monitoring program. In doing so, the City Council affirmed the June 13, 2018 decision of Respondent Planning Commission of the City of Santa Clara also approving the P'roject and MND. The Planning Commission's decision in turn affirmed the April 18, 2018 of Respondent Architectural Design Review Committee of the City of Santa Clara. The action challenges each of these decisions.

The Petition being filed will request that the Court grant the following relief:

1. Issue peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents and Real Parties in Interest to set aside the approval of the Project at 2305 Mission College
Boulevard unless and until Respondents have prepared, circulated, and considered
a legally adequate CEQA document prior to any subsequent approval action;

2. Issue peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents and Real Parties in
Interest to suspend all activity in furtherance of the Project at 2305 Mission
College Boulevard unless and until Respondents take all necessary steps to bring
their actions into compliance with CEQA;

3. Issue a preliminary and permanent injunction staying the effect of Respondents' approval of the Project at 2305 Mission College Boulevard;

4. Issue a declaratory judgment declaring Respondents' approval of the Project at 2305 Mission College Boulevard to be null and void and contrary to law;

5. Award costs of suit;

6. Award attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §1021.5 and any other applicable provisions of law; and

7. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
Petitioner urges the City Council to rescind its approval of the Project and direct staff to conduct the environmental analysis CEQA requires.
