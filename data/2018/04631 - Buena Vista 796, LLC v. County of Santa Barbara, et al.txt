VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. Petitioner Buena Vista 796, LLC ("Petitioner" or "Buena Vista") brings this Verified

3 Petition for Writ of Mandate ("Petition") to remedy the County of Santa Barbara's failure to

4 properly evaluate, under the California Environmental Quality Act (*CEQA," California Public

5 Resources Code, ยง 21000 et seq.), the potential significant environmental impacts of a real estate

6 development project proposed by the Lighthouse Trust. The project seeks to voluntarily demolish

7 and rebuild residential structures in an area of Montecito that (a) was affected by the January 9,

8 2018, debris flows and slides and (b) has been identified by the County itself as being an "Extreme
9 Risk Area" for future debris flows and flooding. In light of these circumstances, the County

10 improperly determined that the Lighthouse Trust project is categorically exempt from the provisions

11 of CEQA.

12 THE PARTIES

13 2. Buena Vista is California limited liability company whose business address is 219
14 Anacapa Street, Santa Barbara, California 93101. Buena Vista is the owner of real property located
15 at 796 Buena Vista Drive in the Montecito community in the unincorporated portion of the County
16 of Santa Barbara. Michael MacElhenny is the managing member of Buena Vista,
17 3. Respondent County of Santa Barbara (the "County") is a political subdivision of the
18 State of California. The County acts by and through its Board of Supervisors ("Board"), its

19 Montecito Planning Commission, and its Montecito Board of Architectural Review. The County
20 and its Board shall collectively be referred to as "Respondents."

21 4. DOES 1 through 100, inclusive, are, on the basis of information and belief, agents,
22 affiliates, representatives, employees, volunteers, and associates of the named Respondents. The

23 identities of said DOES are currently unknown, and when they become known, the Petition will be

24 amended to add them,

25 5. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Real Party in
26 Interest Errett Van Nice, as Trustee of the Lighthouse Trust U/T/A Dated as of July 11, 2016 (the
27 "Lighthouse Trust"), is the owner of real property located at 1948 and 1952 Tollis Avenue in the
28 Montecito community in the unincorporated portion of the County of Santa Barbara.

1
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 6. ROES 1 through 100, inclusive, are, on the basis of information and belief, agents,

2 affiliates, associates, members, owners, assignees, and successors of the Lighthouse Trust or its
trustee(s) or beneficiaries. The identities of said ROES are currently unknown, and when they

4 become known, the Petition will be amended to add them.

5 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

6 The Lighthouse Proiect

7 7. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that the Lighthouse

8 Trust currently owns the contiguous properties located at 1948 and 1952 Tollis Avenue in
9 Montecito (collectively, the "Property").

10 8. In 2017, the Lighthouse Trust's designated agent, Brian Banks, applied to the County

11 for certain land use development approvals, including a Land Use Permit from the County's

12 Planning and Development Director and a Preliminary Design Review approval from the Montecito

13 Board of Architectural Review. Broadly speaking, these applications requested the County to

14 authorize the Lighthouse Trust to: (a) merge the two existing, contiguous lots into one; (b)
15 demolish the two existing single-family homes; (c) construct a new single-family residence, an
16 underground basement, attached garage, guesthouse, cabana, pool, detached garage, and water

17 tanks; and (d) install new landscaping (collectively, the "Project").

18 9. The Lighthouse Trust's application to the County indicated that over 6,000 cubic

19 yards of soil would need to be excavated for the Project. The Lighthouse Trust subsequently
20 indicated that, in order to construct the Project's 4,947 square foot basement, approximately 4,800
21 cubic yards of soil would need to be excavated. The Lighthouse Trust indicated in its grading plan

22 that a substantial portion of the excavated soil will be utilized as fill on the Project site.

23 10. In its records, the County identifies the Lighthouse Trust as having the address of

24 1212 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10046. In its records, the County identifies the

25 Lighthouse Trust's agent, Brian Banks, as having the mailing address of P.O. Box 591,
26 Summerland, California 93067.

27 11. In 2017, the County's Planning and Development Director approved the Project's
28 Land Use Permit. After five hearings that resulted in minor architectural changes to the Project, the

2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

v

L

2 Montecito Board of Architectural Review approved the Preliminary Design Review for the Project.

3 Buena Vista's representative timely appealed these approvals to the Montecito Planning

4 Commission, which also approved the Project's land use approvals on January 3, 2018. Buena Vista
again timely appealed the Project to the County's Board of Supervisors.

6 Santa Barbara County's Response to the Thomas Fire and Subsequent Montecito Slides

12.

7 On December 4, 2017, the rapidly-moving Thomas Fire began in Ventura County.

8 Within two weeks, the fire had spread to Santa Barbara County, where it scorched the hillsides
above Montecito and destroyed over two dozen homes in that community. The fire ultimately grew
9 to be the largest in California's recorded history.

10 13.

11 The potential impact of wildfire on debris flow is well known. Wildfire consumes

12 the vegetation and shallow root system that holds soil in place, setting the stage for rapid erosion.

13 The intense heat also causes slopes to repel, rather than absorb, rainwater by changing the

14 composition of the soil and drying the soil to such a degree that it loses the ability to soak up water.

15 Steep slopes are particularly susceptible to erosion following wildfire.
14.

16 In January 2018, a powerful storm inundated parts of Santa Barbara County with
rain. The scarred hillsides above Montecito

17 gave way, causing flooding, mudslides, and debris
flows that led to the loss of nearly two dozen lives.

18 15.

19 The January slides caused substantial physical and property damage in Montecito as
well, The slides damaged or destroyed over 200 homes and over 100 other structures (e.g., guest
20 homes, bridges, and commercial buildings) in Montecito.

21 16.

22 The January slides affected the Lighthouse Trust Property as well as adjacent and

23 nearby residences. Buena Vista Creek, which is north of the Property, could not contain the debris

24 flow that ultimately traveled through a local channel, across Buena Vista Drive, and down to the

25 Property itself as well as to the south and east of the Property, A map compiled by the County

26 Office of Emergency Management indicates that several structures near the Property were damaged
or destroyed by this debris flow.

27 17.

28 After the January slides, the County's Office of Emergency Management prepared a
map indicating, in part, which areas of Montecito would be subject to ongoing risk from future

3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

debris flows. That map, last updated March 10, 2018, designates the Lighthouse Property as being

2 in the "Extreme Risk Area," which the County defined to mean that the Property is still "at risk of

3 debris flows from water overtopping the banks, creating high velocity flow (debris, rocks, mud and

4 water) that causes destruction."

5 18. In a March 13, 2018, memorandum entitled "Guidance to Property Owners

6 Montecito Debris Flow Rebuilds," the County's Planning and Development Department provided

7 guidance to property owners seeking to rebuild damaged or destroyed structures after the Thomas

8 Fire and January slides. According to the memorandum, "County staff is working to assist property

0 owners in the rebuild process following the January 9th debris flow in Montecito which occurred

10 after a very significant rainfall event in the Thomas burn area. Unlike rebuilding after fire, the

11 current situation poses unique challenges."

12 19. The March 13, 2018, memorandum continues:

13 Additionally, according to the U.S. Forest Service Burned Area

14 Emergency Response Team and the State of California Watershed Emergency Response Team reports, the area is subject to ongoing

15 threats of debris flows during significant rain events (a half inch of rain or more in an hour) for the next two to five years. In order to

16 prevent potential damage to rebuilt structures and other structures in the community, any improvements that occur during this timeframe
17 should be done with proper attention to changes in topography and new creck profiles.

18 20. Despite the County's March 13, 2018, memorandum, the Lighthouse Trust continued

19 to seek approval from the County of its Project, which constitutes a voluntary demolition and
20 rebuild of a home in an Extreme Risk Area.

21 The County's Local CEQA Guidelines and Thresholds

22 21. Broadly speaking, CEQA directs certain state and local agencies to identify the

23 significant environmental impacts of certain of their actions and to avoid or mitigate such impacts,

24 if feasible. A "significant effect on the environment" is a substantial, or potentially substantial,

25 adverse change in the physical conditions of the area affected by a proposed project. (Cal. Pub.

26 Resources Code, ยง 21068; CEQA Guidelines, ยง 15382.) A "project" is "the whole of an action,

27 which has a potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment, or a

28 reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment." (CEQA Guidelines, ยง 15378,

4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

v

subd. (a).) A "project" may include: an activity directly undertaken by any public agency (e.g.,

2 public works construction); an activity undertaken by a private entity that is supported in whole or

3 in part by a public agency (e.g., through grants or subsidies); or an activity involving the issuance to

4 a private entity an agency approval such as a permit or license. (Ibid.)

22. The Governor's Office of Planning and Research and the California Natural

6 Resources Agency together prepare, develop, certify, and adopt the "CEQA Guidelines" (14 Cal.

7 Code Regs., ยง 15000 et seq.) and amendments thereto. The CEQA Guidelines are regulations that

8 clarify, interpret, and implement CEQA.

9 23. The CEQA Guidelines encourage local agencies such as the County to:

10 develop and publish thresholds of significance that the agency uses in
11 the determination of the significance of environmental effects. A threshold of significance is an identifiable quantitative, qualitative or
12 performance level of particular environmental effect, non-
compliance with which means the effect will normally be determined
13 to be significant by the agency and compliance with which means the

14 effect normally will be determined to be less than significant.

15 (CEQA Guidelines, ยง15064.7, subd. (a).)

16 24. The County adopted Guidelines for the Implementation of the California
17 Environmental Quality Act of 1970 As Amended ("Implementation Guidelines"), which, broadly
18 speaking, governs the County's implementation of the procedural elements of CEQA. The County

19 also adopted its Environmental Thresholds and Guidelines Manual ("Thresholds Manual"), which,
20 broadly speaking, guides the County's substantive determination under CEQA as to whether a
21 project may have a significant effect on the environment.

22 25. The County's Implementation Guidelines provide that a project applicant must
23 include, at the outset of the permitting process, sufficient information to properly evaluate the

24 project, For example, the Guidelines direct that a permit application should contain "[d]etailed

25 information on site conditions, particularly any unique characteristics such as environmentally

26 sensitive habitats or geologic hazards."

27 26. Pursuant to the County's Thresholds Manual, a project is deemed to have a
28 potentially significant environmental impact "if the proposed development activity, including all

5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

V

F proposed mitigation measures, could result in substantially increased erosion, landslides, soil creep,

2 mudslides and unstable slopes.... In addition, impacts are considered significant when people or

3 structures would be exposed to major geologic hazards upon implementation of the project."

4 (Emphasis added.)

5 The Board of Supervisor's Consideration of the Lighthouse Project

6 27. On May 15, 2018, four months after the Montecito slides, the Santa Barbara County

7 Board of Supervisors considered Buena Vista's appeal regarding the Project.

8 28. In advance of the hearing, Buena Vista timely submitted written comments to the

9 Board regarding the proposed Project. A true and correct copy of that May 11, 2018, letter, without

10 its attachments, is attached hereto as Exhibit A. In its comment letter, Buena Vista explained that

11 the County and Lighthouse Trust failed to consider potential significant environmental impacts

12 from the Project arising from and associated with the January 9, 2018, slides, which physically and

13 otherwise transformed the landscape of the Montecito community, While the County expressly
14 recognized that there are substantial ongoing risks associated with development within Montecito,

15 the County did not evaluate such risks in connection with the Project even though the Lighthouse

16 Property was affected by the January slides and the County identified the Property as being in an
17 Extreme Risk. Area for future debris flows and flooding.

18 29. At the May 15, 2018, hearing before the Board, Buena Vista provided additional

19 verbal comments regarding the County's failure to comply with the provisions of CEQA.
20 30, At the conclusion of the May 15, 2018, hearing regarding the Project, the Board
21 denied Buena Vista's appeal of the Project, thereby approving the Land Use Permit and Preliminary

22 Design Review for the Project. In so doing, the Board adopted certain findings. The Board also

23 adopted, pursuant to CEQA, a Notice of Exemption for the Project.

24 31. The County's Notice of Exemption determined that the Project is "categorically"

25 exempt from CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15301, subdivision (l) and section
26 15303, subdivisions (a) and (e), The Notice of Exemption also addressed CEQA Guidelines section

27 15300.2, which enumerates several exceptions to the categorical exemptions provided for in the
28 CEQA Guidelines, including subdivision (c), which provides, "A categorical exemption shall not be

6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant a

2 effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances.3 The County's Notice of Exemption for

3 the Project states, "There is no substantial evidence that the proposed project involves unusual
4 circumstances, including future activities, resulting in or which might reasonably result in

5 significant impacts which threaten the environment. Accordingly, this exception to the Categorical

6 Exemption is not applicable to the proposed project."

7 32. County staff informed Buena Vista's representative that the County's Clerk of the
8 Board publicly posted the Notice of Exemption on May 16, 2018.

9 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTR VE REMEDIES. INADEQUATE REMEDY AT LAW,

10 JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

11 33. Petitioner Buena Vista has exhausted all available administrative remedies before

12 Respondents or is otherwise excused from doing so.

13 34. Buena Vista has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law, and thus seeks a writ

14 of mandate from this Court.

15 35. Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21667.5, Buena Vista timely and properly
16 notified Respondents that Buena Vista intended to file this Petition. A true and correct copy of that
17 notice, including its proof of service, is attached hereto as Exhibit B.

18 36. Buena Vista separately and concurrently notifies Respondents that Buena Vista has

19 elected to prepare the record of proceedings in this matter pursuant to Public Resources Code
20 section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2).

21 37. Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21667.4, subdivision (a), and CEQA

22 Guidelines section 15232, Buena Vista separately and concurrently requests from this Court a

23 hearing on this Petition.

24 38. This Court has jurisdiction to issue the requested writ of mandate pursuant to Public

25 Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.9 and California Code of Civil Procedure sections

26 1094.5 and/or 1085.

27 39. Venue in this Court is appropriate pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 393
28 and 394 because the County and the Lighthouse Property are located in the County of Santa

1 Barbara.

2 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

3 Violation of CEQA: Improper Determination of Categorical Exemption

4 (Against All Respondents and Real Parties in Interest)

5 40. Paragraphs 1 through 39 are incorporated here as if fully set forth herein.

6 41. The County determined that the Lighthouse Project was categorically exempt from

7 CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15301 and 15303.

8 42. Pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15300,2, subdivision (c), "A categorical

9 exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity

10 will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances."

11 43. There is a reasonable possibility that the Project will have a significant effect on the

12 environment due to unusual circumstances.

13 44. There are "unusual circumstances" concerning the Project arising from the January

14 9, 2018, slides in Montecito. The County itself identifies the Lighthouse Property as being in an

15 Extreme Risk Area, meaning that the Property is still "at risk of debris flows from water
16 overtopping the banks, creating high velocity flow (debris, rocks, mud and water) that causes
17 I destruction.ยป

18 45. In addition, the County, in a March 13, 2018, memorandum noted, "Unlike

19 rebuilding after a fire, the current situation poses unique challenges." The County further noted,

20 Additionally, according to the U.S. Forest Service Burned Area

21 Emergency Response Team and the State of California Watershed
Emergency Response Team reports, the area is subject to ongoing
22 threats of debris flows during significant rain events (a half inch of
23 rain or more in an hour) for the next two to five years, In order to prevent potential damage to rebuilt structures and other structures in
the community, any improvements that occur during this timeframe
24 should be done with proper attention to changes in topography and

25 new creek profiles.

26 (Emphasis added.)
27 46. The County's determination that the proposed Project does not involve unusual
28 circumstances "which might reasonably result in significant impacts which threaten the

8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 environment" is not supported by substantial evidence in the record.

2 47. The unusual circumstances described above give rise to a reasonable possibility that a

3 the Project will have a significant effect on the environment.

4 48. Pursuant to the County's own Thresholds Manual, a project is automatically deemed

5 to have a potentially significant environmental impact "if the proposed development activity,

6 including all proposed mitigation measures, could result in substantially increased erosion,
landslides, soil creep, mudslides and unstable slopes.... In addition, impacts are considered

8 significant when people or structures would be exposed to major geologic hazards upon
9 implementation of the project."

10 49. The County itself identifies the Lighthouse Property as being "at risk of debris flows

11 from water overtopping the banks, creating high velocity flow (debris, rocks, mud and water) that

12 causes destruction." In addition, the Project, its inhabitants, and its neighbors may be exposed to

13 major geologic hazards if the Project is implemented. The County failed to analyze the potential
14 impact, on the Property and nearby property owners, of the Project's substantial earthwork, given

15 the potential changes in topography and creek profiles that have resulted, or may result in the future,
16 from mud and debris flows.

17 50. There is a "fair argument," as that terminology is understood in is the CEQA context,

18 that the unusual circumstances described above give rise to a reasonable possibility that the Project

19 will a have a significant environmental impact.

20 51. The County improperly determined that the Project is exempt from the provisions of

21 CEQA, The County improperly determined that there "is no substantial evidence that the proposed

22 project involves unusual circumstances, including future activities, resulting in or which might

23 reasonably result in significant impacts which threaten the environment." The County improperly

24 determined that the "exception to the Categorical Exemption [found in CEQA Guidelines section

25 15300.2, subdivision (c)] is not applicable to the proposed project."

26 52. The County's improper determination that the Project is exempt from the provisions

27 of CEQA constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

Re: MacElhenny Appeal of Lighthouse Trust Demo/Rebuild Project (Case Nos. 16BAR-00000-00219 and 17LUP-00000-00035) Hearing Agenda May 15, 2018

Dear Chair Williams and Members of the Board:

On January 9, 2018, the County of Santa Barbara experienced deadly and widespread debris flows and mudslides that, physically and otherwise, transformed the landscape of its communities, particularly Montecito. Even as Montecito residents attempt to rebuild damaged and destroyed homes and properties, the County of Santa Barbara has recognized that there are substantial ongoing risks associated with such development. The County therefore has determined that it requires additional technical information before it can have confidence that individual projects may proceed without adversely impacting project applicants and their neighbors. Notably, County staff has requested that individual property owners refrain from pursuing plans for rebuilding homes until that information becomes available.
In the midst of the County's efforts to balance public safety concerns with the needs of residents who lost their homes and other structures, the Lighthouse Trust continues to seek approval from the County to voluntarily demolish two homes and rebuild one new residence on its property on Tollis Avenue in Montecito. This property was physically impacted by the January mud-slides and has been identified by the County as being in an Extreme Risk Area for future debris flows and flooding. Despite these critical issues, the Lighthouse Trust has not provided any information required to properly evaluate the potential environmental impacts

Exhibit A

Chair Williams

associated with the project. This is true even though the County's local environmental standards
dictate that environmental "impacts are considered significant when people or structures would
be exposed to major geologic hazards upon implementation of the project." (Emphasis added.)

Instead of properly addressing the potential impacts of its project in order to assure the safety of the applicant and its neighbors, the Lighthouse Trust continues to seek special treatient to pursue its project as though the January slides did not occur. All County decision-makers who have considered the Lighthouse Trust project did so prior to January 9, 2018, without the benefit of the considerable new information regarding debris flows and flood risk that is now known to the County and the Montecito community.

In light of the Lighthouse Trust project's failure to consider potential environmental impacts arising from and associated with the January 9th slides, we request that the Board of Supervisors direct County staff to prepare the requisite technical studies and analyses -- under the California Environmental Quality Act and otherwise - s0 that the County and the Montecito community are assured that the project can be developed without adversely impacting the applicant and its neighbors.
While the project applicant will most assuredly object to any delay arising from the to-be- completed technical studies and analyses, recall again that the Lighthouse Trust seeks to demolish its existing residences voluntarily; it is not trying to rebuild a home lost in the catastrophe of January 9th. Consequently, any considerations that support a streamlined rebuilding process are entirely inapplicable here. The Lighthouse Trust project's tension with substantial public safety concerns cannot and should not be overridden by arguments regarding
project delays.

Accordingly, on behalf of Michael MacElhenny', we submit the following comments
regarding the above-referenced item and request that this letter be included in the adrninistrative
record for the matter.

The Project: The Lighthouse Trust, of New York, New York2, owns the adjacent

attached garage, guesthouse, guesthouse garage, swimming pool, pool cabana, and two new water tanks (the "Project"). The Project also proposes to "cut," or excavate, approximately 4,800 cubic yards of soil to accommodate the proposed home's 4,947 sq, ft. basement. While a substantial portion of the excavated soil will be utilized as fill on the site, the excavation involves the equivalent of approximately 343 to 480 truck trips worth of soil. The Project also includes a new landscaping plan.
The Lighthouse Trust submitted applications to the County for preliminary design review approval from the Montecito Board of Architectural Review (MBAR) as well a land use permit from the Planning and Development Director. Michael MacElhenny appealed the MBAR and Director approvals to the Montecito Planning Commission and, in turn, that Commission's
approval of the Project to the Board of Supervisors. Notably, all of the County decision-makers that have previously considered the project did so before January 9, 2018 - without the benefit of current knowledge regarding the debris flow and flood risks in Montecito and on the Property.
The January 9, 2018 Slides: The Planning Commission considered the Project on a January 3, 2018. Less than a week later, the Montecito area was subjected to devastating and tragic mudslides that claimed almost two dozen lives and damaged or destroyed over 200 homes and over 100 other structures (e.g., guest homes, bridges, and commercial buildings) in Montecito. (See Attachments A, B.)
Notably, the slides affected the Property and damaged adjacent and nearby residences. Buena Vista Creek, which is north of the Property, could not contain debris flow that ultimately traveled to the Property itself as well as to the south and east. That flow traversed a local channel
that crosses Buena Vista Avenue. (See April 30, 2018, photographs included as Attachment C.) A map compiled-by the Santa Barbara Independent illustrates the debris flow path into, through, and beyond that local channel,' (See Attachment D.) This same map confirms that debris flow ended up on the Lighthouse Property itself and, indeed, in areas of the Property where the Project's larger new home will be constructed.
Furthermore, a separate map compiled by the County Office of Emergency Management demonstrates that several structures near the Proporty were damaged or destroyed by the debris flow, including the home to the south, a guest home two properties north, and several homes just

east of the Lighthouse Property.* (See Attachment E.) Lastly, the Office of Emergency Management prepared a map indicating, in part, which arcas of Montecito comprise existing debris flow risk areas. (See Attachment F.) That map, last updated March 10, 2018, identifies the Lighthouse Property as being within the Extreme Risk Arca, the highest level of concern. That designation recognizes that a property is "at risk of debris flows from water overtopping the banks, creating high velocity flow (debris, rocks, mud and water) that causes destruction."

In a March 13, 2018, memorandum (Attachment G), the County reaffirmed that the
Montecito area:

is subject to ongoing threats of debris flows during significant rain events (a half inch of rain or more in an hour) for the next two to
five years. In order to prevent potential damage to rebuilt
structures and other structures in the community, any
improvements that occur during this timeframe should be done with proper attention to changes in topography and new creek profiles.

(Emphasis added.) The County further explained that "the current situation poses unique
challenges" even beyond what would be associated with "rebuilding after a fire, as the
Montecito "landforms have changed significantly, including property elevations and at some
locations, the width and depth of creeks.'

The Ongoing Impacts of the January Slides: In fact, the County's March 13, 2018
memorandum indicates that the entire floodplain management program is currently inadequate. As noted, the County relies heavily on FEMA's Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) in implementing its own floodplain ordinance. As the memorandum notes, though,
the current FIRM maps are no longer representative of on-the- ground conditions due to the land-changing debris flow. The base flood elevations on the current FIRM maps do not reflect current topography and are of little use in the rebuilding process where

topography has changed. FBMA will be developing new FIRM maps but this is expected to take four to five years.
To provide interim assistance to property owners while the FIRM maps are permanently updated, County staff, in conjunction with FEMA, is preparing a "Flood Hazard/Mapping Analysis" to be completed in several months. County staff has advised property owners to delay design plans and permit applications in Montecito so that the County's land use permit process and decisions may be informed by the Flood Hazard/Mapping Analysis.
For those property owners that decline the County's request to wait until the interim Flood Hazard/Mapping Analysis has been completed, the March 13th memorandum states that the County will require "submittals" to "facilitate the review process," which submittals may include: a current topographic study; a hydrologic analysis; and plans prepared with the geotechnical civil and hydraulic engineering, soil erosion, hydrology, and engineering geology expertisc.

In addition to the caution expressed by County staff, the Montecito community supports the County's efforts to ensure that new development within Montecito is approved after being informed at least by the Flood Hazard/Mapping Analysis. In April, the Montecito Planning Commission reaffirmed the County's March 13th memorandum, discussed above, and voted unanimously to:

recommend() that the Board of Supervisors wait to take action on
the proposed Ordinance Amendment to the Montecito Land Use and Development Codo (MLUDC) and recommend[] that the County Planning Commission recommend that the Board ofโข Supervisors wait to take action on the proposed Ordinance Amendment to Article II, the Coastal Zoning Ordinance, until the
Flood Hazard/Recovery Mapping comes out in June 2018,
members of the public have had sufficient time to review the
Ordinance Amendments in context with the new advisory base
flood elevations, and resiliency and adaptive management
strategies have been considered. Upon receipt of this information, the Montecito Planning Commission requests that the Ordinance Amendments be referred back to the Montecito Planning
Commission for further review and recommendations,

(Attachment H; emphasis added.) The Montecito Planning Commission Chair, Joe Cole, stated
that the County's proposed ordinance amendments regarding streamlined rebuilding should be delayed because the "County needs an overall strategy that would include a threat analysis, early
Exhibit A Page 5of S Pages

Chair Williams
Board of Supervisors

Page 6

warning monitoring, slope protections and neighborhood zoning based on actual hazard maps." Chair Cole continued, "We need to use FEMA mapping to figure out where the real risks are." (Attachment I.)
The California Environmental Quality Aet: While the County has, so far, indicated that new development within Montecito should be informed by technical analyses of the development site's ongoing flood and hazard risks, it is also important to remember that the County's interim response to the January slides is not the only arbiter of what analyses may be required in connection with the land use permit process. The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) is designed, in part, to "[i]nform governmental decision makers and the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of proposed activities" and to "fi]dentify the ways that environmental damage can be avoided or significantly reduced." (CEQA Guidelines, ยง 15002.)
In order to determine when a development project may have a potentially significant impact on the environment, CEQA encourages local agencies such as the County to:
develop and publish thresholds of significance that the agency uses in the determination of the significance of environmental effects. A
threshold of significance is an identifiable quantitative, qualitative or performance level of a particular environmental effect, non-
compliance with which means the effect will normally be determined to be significant by the agency and compliance with which means the effect normally will be determined to be less than
significant.

(CEQA Guidelines, ยง15064.7, subd, (a).) The County has accepted this invitation. First, the County has established a detailed framework - its Guidelines for the Implementation of the California Environmental Quality Act of 1970 As Amended - governing the procedural components of CEQA. (Attachment J.) The County also adopted its Environmental Thresholds and Guidelines Manual, which guide the "Planning and Development Department's determination on whether or not a project may have a significant effect on the environment."
(Attachment K..)

On the procedural side, the County's Guidelines provide that a project applicant must include; at the outset of the permitting process, sufficient information to properly evaluate the project. For example, the Guidelines direct that a permit application should contain "[d]etailed information on site conditions, particularly any unique characteristics such as environmentally sensitive habitats or geologic hazards is required." Additionally, for "projects which may ... pose

Exhibit A
Pageleof&Pages

Chair Williams
Board of Supervisors
May 11, 2018
Page 7

a threat to public health or safety, information regarding the engineering basis and design of the project facilities and the effects of project operations is required."

Such information is critical because, as the County's Environmental Thresholds and
Guidelines Manual instructs, a project is deemed to have a potentially significant environmental impact "if the proposed development activity, including all proposed mitigation measures, could result in substantially increased erosion, landslides, soil creep, mudslides and unstable slopes.... In addition, impacts are considered significant when people or structures would be exposed to major geologic hazards upon implementation of the project." (Emphasis added.)

The Lighthouse Project's Potentially Significant Impacts: With regard to the
Lighthouse Trust Project, the County prepared - before the January slides - a project description and Notice of Exemption indicating that the Project was exempt from the provisions of CEQA.
The same project description and Notice of Exemption, which have not been revised to address
the substantial environmental issues arising from the January slides, appear in the Board's packet for the appeal. Notably, then, the County has not addressed, through the CEQA process or otherwise, the potential impacts associated with demolishing and rebuilding a home in what the County itself has identified as an Extreme Risk Area for ongoing debris flows and flooding.
Instead, the County continues to rely on CEQA exemptions that are typically applicable to single-family homes and similarly inconsequential projects. However, the CEQA exemptions relied on by the County are, in CEQA terminology, categorical exemptions, which renders them subject to CEQA Guidelines section 15300,2 - the "exception to the exemptions" provision. That CEQA Guidelines provision specifies, in part, that categorical exemptions "shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances."

It is clear that both elements of the "exception to the exemption" - unusual circumstances
and the reasonable possibility of a significant impact - are present with regard to the Lighthouse
Project. As discussed above, Santa Barbara County experienced a life- and community-altering event in January. The Lighthouse Property was itself impacted by the debris flow resulting from the January slides. The same debris flow damaged or destroyed structures on adjacent and nearby properties. The risk is also ongoing. The County itself identified the Property as being in an Extreme Risk Area. The County acknowledged that its prior flood management program is, currently, severely lacking. The January slides radically altered not only the physical conditions of Montecito, but also what was known about the likely risks associated with living in
Montecito.

Additionally, there is beyond a "reasonable possibility" that the Project will have
significant adverse enyironmental impact. As noted above, the County's own CBQA thresholds
Exhibit A Page_3of SPages

Chair Williams
Board of Supervisors
May 11,2018
Page 8

state that "impacts are considered significant when people or structures would be exposed to major geologie hazards upon implementation of the project." Again, the County identified the
Property as being in an Extreme Risk Area. Moreover, the flood and debris risk associated with the Property is not just hypothetical. The Property was, as discussed above, actually impacted by the debris flow from the Buena Vista Creek, Despite this, the County has not conducted an analysis, under CEQA or otherwise, regarding these potential impacts.

It is also worth noting that the Lighthouse Project includes elements that threaten to increase the Property's geologic hazards. For example, in order to accommodate the Project, including its basement, approximately 340 to 480 truck trips worth of soil will be excavated at the Property, including, in the words of County staff, to "step down the hillside in a manicured landscape." The County has not analyzed the potential impact of such grading, including potential impacts on adjacent properties as a result of such significant earthwork.
For the foregoing reasons, we request that the Board grant the appeals outright, or, alternatively, direct the Planning and Development Department to prepare an Initial Study under CEQA that will inform the County as to what type of environmental review will be required under CEQA for the Project if it proceeds.'

Sincerely, TM I Neal P. Maguire

6 Pursuant to the County's Guidelines for the Implementation of the California Environmental Quality Act of 1970 As Amended, "A determination that a project is not exempt may not be appealed; a determination that a project is exempt may be reviewed by the decisionmaker at the time of consideration of the project, and if the decisionmaker disagrees with the determination of exemption, the decisionmaker shall instruct the Planning and Development Department to
prepare an Initial Study." (Emphasis added.)
