Re: Notice of Intent to File CEQA Petition In Connection with Artesia Live II Project Approvals

Dear Mr. Elayath:
Please take notice that on or before April 12, 2018, the City of Cerritos will file a petition for writ of mandate in Los Angeles County Superior Court challenging actions of the City of Artesia and City of Artesia City Council approving various entitlements and mitigated negative dcclaration (collectively, the "Project Approvals") in connection with the proposed Artesia Live II development. Cornerstone Artesia Development, LCC will be named as a Real Party in Interest.

The City of Cerritos will challenge the Project Approvals on the grounds that, among other things, the City failed to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") (Cal. Pub. Res. Code ยง21000 et seq.) by not preparing an environmental impact report. Cerritos will also allege violations of State Planning and Zoning Law (Cal. Gov. Code ยง65000 et seq.). The a petition will request, among other relief, a peremptory writ of mandate directing that the various approvals for the Artesia Live II project be vacated and set aside and that โข Artesia be ordered to prepare an environmental impact report, and otherwise proceed as required by CEQA and State Planning and Zoning Law. The petition will also request Petitioner's costs and attorney fees. This notice is given pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.5.

Very truly yours,
