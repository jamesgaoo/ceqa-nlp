Exhibit 1, Page 3

INTRODUCTORY ALLEGATIONS

2 1. This Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint ("Petition") is brought by
3 Petitioner/Plaintiff City of Irvine ("City") pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085,
4 1094.5, 1060 and 526 et seq., as well as Public Resources Code sections 21167, 21168 and 21168.5,
to challenge the County of Orange ("County") and Orange County Board of Supervisors' ("Board")
6 (collectively, "Respondents") approval of a high impact, high-density multi-family residential
7 project allowing development of 803 residential dwelling units (the "Project") on approximately
8 32.32 acres adjacent to a protected 11.84 acre wildlife corridor, totaling approximately 44.16 acres,
9 in the City of Irvine ("City") (the "Site") that was formerly part of the EI Toro Marine Corps Air
10 Station (the "Base"). Respondents' approval of the Project ignored the fact that the Site has long

11 been planned for only low impact, permanent agricultural and open space uses, as reflected in the
12 applicable City and County General Plan and zoning designations, as well as the parties' Property
13 Tax Transfer and Pre-Annexation Agreement (*Property Tax Exchange Agreement") and City's
14 Amended and Restated Development Agreement ("ARDA"), which governs the redevelopment of
15 the former Base as the Orange County Great Park ("OCGP").

16 2. As described in more detail herein, Respondents' approval of the Project violated the
17  California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA," codified as Public Resources Code §§ 21000 et
18  seq.); the State CEQA Guidelines ("CEQA Guidelines," promulgated as title 14 of the California

19 Code of Regulations, § 15000 et seq.); the City's General Plan, the County's General Plan, including

20 a ballot measure amending the same ("Measure W'), City and County Code; and the Property Tax
21  Exchange Agreement entered into by the City and County (as well as the City's now defunct
22 Redevelopment Agency) concerning future use the Site.

23 3, This Petition seeks a Court Order mandating that Respondents rescind the
24 June 5, 2018 approval of Resolution 18-052 (the "Resolution"), which (a) certified Final EIR
25 No. 621 for the West Alton Parcel Development Plan ("FEIR"); (b) adopted a Statement of Facts,
26 Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations for the FEIR; (c) adopted a Mitigation and
27 Monitoring and Reporting Program ("MMRP") for the FEIR; and (d) approved the West Alton
28 Parcel Development Plan ("Development Plan"), as proposed in the FEIR.

Exhibit 1, Page 4

1 4. This Petition further seeks a Court Order (a) mandating that Respondents rescind
2 approval of the Resolution because it is inconsistent is with both the City and/or County General Plan,
3 and (b) enjoining Respondents from approving any other project on the Site or any other property
that was formerly part of the Base and is now under County control that allows uses that are
5 inconsistent with either the City or County General Plans (i.e., the 100 Acre Parcel, as that term is
6 defined herein).

7 5. This Petition further seeks a Court Order (a) declaring that Respondents, by
8 approving the Resolution, have breached the Property Tax Exchange Agreement because the
9 Property Tax Exchange Agreement does not allow Respondents to approve the uses allowed by the
10 Project on the Site, and (b) enjoining Respondents from approving any other project on the Site or

11 any other property that was formerly part of the Base and is now under County control that allows
12 üses not contemplated by the Property Tax Exchange Agreement (i.e., the 100 Acre Parcel, as that
13  term is defined herein).

14 6. While Respondents' approval of the Project was unlawful (and the FEIR is
15 inadequate under CEQA) for many reasons, many of the Project and the FEIR's defects are the result
16 of the County's erroneous position that the Project is not subject to any land use authority, and in
17 particular, its steadfast refusal to acknowledge that the City has any authority over a large, for-profit
18 private residential project proposed within its jurisdiction, which has no basis in fact or law.

19 THE PARTIES

20 7. Petitioner and Plaintiff City is, and at all times mentioned herein was, a municipal
21 corporation and charter city, duly organized and existing under the Constitution and laws of the
22 State of California and the City's Charter, and is governed by its duly elected City Council. The
23 City has been, for many years, designated as "the safest city in America" for cities with a population
24 over 100,000 residents. The City has been closely monitoring the processing of the Project to ensure
25 that, among other issues, public safety issues and other matters of governmental and public interest
26 are fully addressed in the FEIR. The City has the authority and duty to protect the public health,
27 safety and general welfare of its citizens, residents, employees and visitors within its boundaries,
28 including those who travel through or are otherwise directly or indirectly affected by the operation

Exhibit 1, Page 5

and use of the Project. By virtue of its police powers, duties and responsibilities, the City is
2 beneficially interested in the Project and the outcome of this proceeding. Unlike virtually any other
development project proposed within the City's jurisdiction, the City was not the lead agency under
4 CEQA for the Project, and the County has steadfastly refused to allow the City land use (or any)

5 approval authority over the Project, over the City's objections. The Project would result in large
6 high-density residential development within the jurisdiction of the City, yet not controlled by the
7 City, nor would it comply with the City's Code, standards or design guidelines. As a result, the a
8 Project will result in significant impacts on the City and its residents.
9 8. Further, issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer significant
10 benefits on the general public by requiring the County to carry out their duties under CEQA and
11 other applicable laws prior to proceeding with the Project. Issuance of the relief requested will also
12 result in the enforcement of important rights affecting the public interest by compelling the County
13 to engage in a fair, objective, and legally adequate analysis of the Project, and ensure that the public
14 has a meaningful opportunity to review and comment on the impacts and mitigation measures for
15 the Project. *. .*

16 9. The City also brings this action as a private attorney general a pursuant to Code of
17 Civil Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory to enforce important rights
18 affecting the public interest. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement are such as to make

19 an award of attorneys' fees appropriate in this case. Absent enforcement by the City, the County
20 will proceed with a project that will cause significant, unmitigated environmental impacts that might
21 otherwise have been reduced or avoided through legally adequate environmental review and the
22 adoption of feasible mitigation measures.

23 10. Respondent and Defendant County is a political and geographical subdivision of the
24 | State of California with its principal offices located in the City of Santa Ana, California, with the
25 legal ability to be sued. (See, Government Code 23001 et. seq.). The County acted as lead agency
26 for environmental review of the Project and certified the FEIR in that capacity, as indicated in the
27 Project's June 5, 2018 Notice of Determination ("NOD"). The County has a mandatory duty to
28 comply with applicable local planning documents (e.g., the City and County General Plans), local

1 ordinances, and state law requirements, including CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, when
2 considering discretionary activities and land use regulatory actions, such as the Project. The County
3  also has a mandatory duty to comply with the Property Tax Exchange Agreement.

4 11. Respondent and Defendant Orange County Board of Supervisors ("Board") is the
5 legislative body of the County, which voted to approve the Project and certify the FEIR by approving
6 the Resolution.

7 12. The City is informed and believes, and alleges thereon that Real Party in Interest
8 | Lowe Enterprises Real Estate Group ("Lowe") is a California corporation. Pursuant to the

9 Development Plan approved by the County on June 5, 2018, Lowe will develop the Project. In
10 substance, the City is informed and believes, and alleges thereon, that Lowe is the proponent - or at
11 a minimum, along with the County, a proponent - of the Project.

12 13. The City is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Respondents and Defendants
13 sued herein as Does through 50 and therefore sues those Respondents and Defendants by such
14 fictitious names. The City is informed and believes, and alleges thereon that each of the fictitiously-
15 named Respondents and Defendants is in some manner responsible or liable for the events and
16 happenings referred to herein, and that each such fictitiously named Respondent and Defendant
17 caused injury and damage to City as alleged in this Petition. The City will seek leave of Court to
18  amend this Petition to allege the true names and capacities of such fictitiously-named Respondents

19 and Defendants when the same are ascertained.

20 14. The City is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Real Parties in Interest sued
21 herein as Roes 51 through 60 and therefore sues those Real Parties in Interest by such fictitious
22 names. The City is informed and believes, and alleges thereon that each of the fictitiously-named
23 Real Parties in Interest is in some manner responsible or liable for the events and happenings referred
24 to herein, and that each such fictitiously named Real Parties in Interest caused injury and damage to
25 City as alleged in this Petition. The City will seek leave of Court to amend this Petition to allege
26  the true names and capacities of such fictitiously-named Real Parties in Interest when the same are
27 ascertained.

EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

2 15. The City has performed all conditions precedent to filing a CEQA action against
3 Respondents and has exhausted all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.
4 The City objected to the approval of the Project and certification of the FEIR during the
5 administrative process, including but not limited to its two comment letters (dated February 9, 2017
6 and June 4, 2018) setting forth, inter alia, the many deficiencies in both the draft and final versions
7 of the EIR, as well as Respondents' violation of the Property Tax Exchange Agreement, the City
8 and County's General Plans, and City and County Code.
9 16. Notice of the City's intent to file this Petition was served by personal service and
10 certified mail, return receipt requested on Respondents on July 3, 2018, to the attention of Hugh
11 Ngyuen, the County Clerk-Recorder (a true and correct copy of the proof of service of this notice is
12 attached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated herein by this reference), pursuant to Public Resources

13 Code section 21167.5.

14 17. A copy of this pleading shall be furnished to the Attorney General of the State of
15 California in accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167.7.

16 18. The City elects to prepare the administrative record, and that election is filed and
17 served with this Petition.

18 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

19 19. This Court has jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to California Code of Civil
20 Procedure sections 1085, 1094.5, 1060, 526 et seq., and CEQA, including but not limited to Public
21 Resource Code sections 21167, 21168 and 21168.5. Venue in this Court is proper pursuant to Code
22 of Civil Procedure section 394, because both the County and the City are located within the County
23 of Orange, and the impacts of the Project will occur in the County of Orange.

24 20. On June 5, 2018, or soon thereafter, the County filed for posting an NOD for the
25 Project. This Petition was filed on July 5, 2018, within the applicable statute of limitations.

26 21. The subject matter of this Complaint relates to Respondents' June 5, 2018 approval
27 of Resolution 18-052, which relates to real property within the boundaries of the City of Irvine.
28 Code of Civil Procedure section 860 et seq, authorizes a local agency or private party to bring an

action in the Superior Court of the County in which the principal office of the local agency is located
2 to determine the validity of a matter that under any other law authorizes to be determined pursuant

3 to Code of Civil Procedure section 860 et seq. Code of Civil Procedure section 860 et seq.
4 establishes that this case is, among other things, a proceeding in rem. Under these facts, jurisdiction

5 and venue are proper in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Orange.

6 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

7 Annexation of the Base from the County into the City

8 22. In July 1992, the United States Department of Navy ("DoN*) decided to close the
9 Base under the Base Realignment and Closure Act. At that time, the Base was located in an
10 unincorporated area of the County.

11 23. At the March 5, 2002 election, the voters of the County adopted Measure W, and in
12 so doing, decided that the Base would be redeveloped as what is now known as the OCGP. In
13 particular, Measure W "amends the Orange County General Plan to authorize the closed [Base] to
14 be used for non-aviation uses, including multi-purpose central park, open space, nature preserve,
15  universities and schools, cultural facility, and other interim and long-term uses described herein."
16 (Measure W, § A.)

17 24. Dating back to November 25, 1997, the City determined that it would pursue the
18 annexation of the Base into the City. Before annexation could be accomplished, the following five
19 steps, among others, had to be completed: (1) prezoning of the property; (2) formulation of a
20 Municipal Services Plan; (3) preparation of a Fiscal Impact Report; (4) preparation of environmental
21 documentation; and (5) entry into a Property Tax Exchange Agreement with the County. Although
22 the City had substantial control over the first four steps in the process, execution of a Property Tax
23 Exchange Agreement required the cooperation, and ultimately consent, of the County.

24 25, Property tax exchange agreements are generally governed by Revenue & Taxation
25 Code (*R&T Code") §§ 99 and 99.02. Property tax exchange agreements, whether formulated
26 pursuant to R&T Code § 99 or R&T Code § 99.02, constitute a modification and reallocation of
27 property tax revenues from the basic property tax allocation scheme, generally known as "AB8", as
28  specifically found in R&T Code §§ 96 and/or 96.1. (See R&T Code §§ 99(a)(1) and 99.02(a).)

12535821.2 a07/05/18 OF CONTRACT, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DECLARATORY RELIEF
Exhibit 1, Page 9

26. Property tax exchange agreements which involve a "jurisdictional a change" subject
2 to the Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Local Government Reorganization Act of 2000 (Division 3)
3 (commencing with Section 56000) of Title 5 of the Government Code (the "Reorganization Act"),
4 such as the annexation of the Base to the City, are governed by R&T Code § 99(b). In general,
5 negotiations of property tax exchange agreements pursuant to R&T Code § 99(b) are limited in
6 scope to the "exchange of property tax revenues."

7 27. In addition to the general procedural and substantive requirements and limitations
8 | imposed upon property tax exchange agreements subject to the Reorganization Act, R&T Code
9 | § 99(e)(1) imposes further substantive and procedural requirements and limitations upon a
10 "jurisdictional change" that consists of the City's qualified annexation of an unincorporated
11 territory, such as the case at bar, which includes, among other things, retention of a third-party
12 consultant to perform a comprehensive, independent, fiscal analysis that specifies estimates of all
13 tax revenues that would be derived from the annexed territory and the cost of county services with
14 respect to the annexed territory, as well as mediation, and ultimately arbitration if an annexing city
15 and a county cannot reach agreement regarding the division of property tax revenues. (R&T Code
16| § 99(e)(1).) A local agency formation commission (*LAFCO") shall not impose any fiscal
17 conditions upon a city's qualified annexation of unincorporated territory other than the division of
18 property tax revenues as determined in the process set forth in R&T Code § 99(e)(1). (R&T Code
19 § 99(e)(2).)

20 28. Property tax exchange agreements formulated outside of the purview of the
21 Reorganization Act are generally governed by R&T Code § 99.02. As is the case with property tax
22 exchange agreements formulated pursuant to R&T Code § 99, property tax exchange agreements
23 formulated pursuant to R&T Code § 99.02 are limited to property tax transfers and exchanges. In
24 addition, property tax exchange agreements formulated pursuant to R&T Code § 99.02 require,
25 among other things, a noticed public hearing and the adoption of certain findings. (R&T Code
26 § 99.02(e)-(f).) The City is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that neither City Council
27 nor the Board followed or complied with R&T Code § 99.02(e)-(f) in relation to any property tax
28  exchange agreement ultimately executed between those parties.

29. The County possessed no viable objections to annexation of the Base into the City.
2 However, and notwithstanding the specific limitations set forth upon property tax exchange

3 agreements in R&T Code §§ 99 and 99.02, the County demanded, and ultimately received, several

4 significant concessions and giveaways from the City beyond an appropriate division of property tax
revenues. In general, as explained in more detail below, the County required that it receive, an
6 approximately 44 acre parcel northwest of the intersection of Alton Parkway and Irvine Boulevard

7 in the City (i.e., the Project Site) and approximately 108 acres generally located south of Marine
8 Way, generally north of the Railroad tracks that run along the southern border of the El Toro
9 property, and generally east of O Street (*100-Acre Parcel"), where the County approved the 100-
10 Acre Development Plan (*100-Acre Project") in November 2017. The County's approval of the
11  100-Acre Project is currently being challenged by the City and other Petitioners in related lawsuits,
12 on grounds substantially similar to those set forth with respect to the Project in this Petition.

13 30. The City, the former Irvine Redevelopment Agency ("Irvine RDA"), and the County
14 | ultimately entered into the Property Tax Exchange Agreement on or about March 4, 2003, Property
15 tax exchange agreements subject to the Reorganization Act, such as the one at bar, are incorporated
16 into the LAFCO approval process in that the LAFCO Executive Officer "shall not issue a certificate
17 of filing pursuant to Section 56658 of the Government Code until the local agencies included in the
18 property tax revenue exchange negotiation ... present resolutions adopted by each such county and
19 city whereby each county and city agrees to accept the exchange of property tax revenues." (R&T
20 Code § 99(b)(6).) The City is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that the Property Tax
21 Exchange Agreement was presented to the Orange County LAFCO Executive Director pursuant to
22 the requirements of R&T Code § 99(b)(6). The Property Tax Exchange Agreement was part and
23 parcel of the LAFCO process.

24 31. As previously discussed, property tax exchange agreements are statutorily limited to
25 the transfer and exchange of property tax revenues. Notwithstanding this fact, the County demanded
26 not only the transfer of the Site and the 100-Acre Parcel to the County, but certain guarantees
27 regarding the land use characterization of the Site to be provided by present and future City
28 Councils. Said demand not only exceeded the authorization set forth in R&T Code §§ 99 and 99.02,

Exhibit 1, Page 11

but once incorporated into the Orange County LAFCO process, further violated the direct
2 prohibition that LAFCO "shall not impose any conditions that would directly regulate land use
3 density or intensity, property development, or subdivision requirements." (Government Code
4 § 56375(a)(6).) In addition, the decision of a LAFCO with regard to a proposal to annex territory

5 to a city, such as the one at bar, "shall be based upon the general plan and prezoning of the city."
6| (Government Code § 56375(a)(7).) In attempting to leverage the LAFCO approval process to secure
7 the exaction of over 150 acres of land, without payment or compensation, along with certain land

8 use and development guarantees, the County, and ultimately the Property Tax Exchange Agreement,
9 ran afoul of the clear limitations and prohibitions set forth in both the Revenue & Taxation Code as
10  well as the Reorganization Act. For these reasons alone, certain provisions of the Property Tax
11 Exchange Agreement should be declared void and without enforceability.

12 32. In the Property Tax Exchange Agreement, the County sought not only the gratis
13 dedication of acres of approximately 152 acres valuable land, but also sought certain land use and
14  development guarantees applicable to both the then-current as well as future City Councils.
15 Although the Property Tax Exchange Agreement does not identify specific uses for the Site, it does
16 define that property as being "for the exclusive use of the County or its designees, lessees, or
17 concessionaires, including but not limited to joint venturers with private or public agencies to
18 construct and operate permitted uses and facilities." (Property Tax Exchange Agreement, § 2.2.3.1).

19 Consistent with that designation, Exhibit A to the Property Tax Exchange Agreement describes the
20 Site (and the 100-Acre Parcel) as "public facilities." (Property Tax Exchange Agreement,
21 Exhibit A, Note 5). Section 2.2.4 of the Property Tax Exchange Agreement further provides:

22 "Irvine agrees that while the parcels of Base property the County is to receive will

23 be annexed to Irvine, that notwithstanding said fact, Irvine will zone County's parcels and designate them in Irvine's General Plan, in accordance with the County's designation. In addition, County shall retain exclusive land use control over said
24 parcels, and shall be entitled to place any development upon said parcels the County

25 shall determine to be desirable for County's needs, as though said property remained unincorporated, without the obligation for payment to Irvine for any permit fees or

26 other mitigation/impact fees, other than in Section 2.2.5, including but not limited to the following uses, all of which Irvine agrees with." "The uses listed in Section 2.2.4 include animal shelters, environmental health facilities, automotive/equipment repair
27 facilities, child care facilities, youth and family resource center, law enforcement training facilities, emergency shelters, transitional shelter care facilities, children and
28 family service centers, business offices, warehouses, storage facilities, vehicle parking and storage facilities, heavy equipment maintenance and storage, and field

2 33. If, and to the extent, sections 2.2.3 and 2.2.4 of the Property Tax Exchange
3 Agreement are ultimately determined to be complete and limitless delegations of City Councilmanic
4 land use authority over the Site (and 100-Acre Parcel) to the County, or its "designees, lessees, or

5 concessionaires. " (Property Tax Exchange Agreement, section 2.2.3.1), the Property Tax
6 Exchange Agreement, or at least those provisions thereof, would constitute an abdication of the
7 City's Police Power, a violation of numerous public hearing, public participation, and transparency
8 requirements and an unlawful delegation of police power constitutionally held by the City Council
9 to external public agencies or even private parties, and thus void and unenforceable.

10 34. Recognizing the potentially unlawful nature of an unbridled grant of police power
11 land use discretion to the County, or its public and private designees, as potentially voiding the gratis
12 extraction of the Site and potentially as well as other property dedicated to the County pursuant to
13 the Property Tax Exchange Agreement, such as the 100-Acre Parcel, the County agreed that its use
14 of the property shall be subject to, at a minimum, County land use controls including the County
15 General Plan, sO that the County's use of the Site would be "as though said property remained
16| unincorporated. . ." (Property Tax Exchange Agreement, Section 2.2.4). This language, which
17  limits the County's "exclusive land use control over said parcels," subjects the County's use of the
18 Site to, at a minimum, County land use controls applied on a uniform and non-discriminatory matter,
19 which the County has also refused to recognize. One of those County land use controls, which
20 would have been applicable on March 4, 2003 and is currently applicable, is Measure W.

21 35. Measure W, which was a voter initiative amending the County's General Plan for all
22 of the property located within the Base, limits the uses available on the Site to public facilities and
23 prohibits, without exception, the uses proposed by the Project, as set forth in more detail herein.
24 Any interpretation of Sections 2.2.3 and 2.2.4 of the Property Tax Exchange Agreement which
25 exempts the Development Plan from the City's General Plan, the County's General Plan (including
26 Measure W), the City's Zoning Code, and the County's Zoning Code clearly and unequivocally
27 constitutes an abdication of the City's police power, a violation of numerous public hearing, public
28 participation, and transparency requirements, and a delegation and abdication of the City's police

1 power land use authority and is unenforceable.

2 36. Assuming that Sections 2.2.3 - 2.2.4 do not constitute an unlawful delegation and
3 abdication of the City's police power land use authority over the Site, those provisions must be
4 | interpreted in a such a manner that the City retains meaningful land use authority over the Site.

5 37. Recognizing that Sections 2.2.3 - 2.2.4, at a minimum, might be unlawful and
6 unenforceable, the County attempted to include a "poison pill" a through the inclusion of Section 5,
7 which reads, in relevant part:

8 "The parties agree that the provisions of this agreement are dependent upon each
9 other, and failure of any party to comply with any provision of this agreement shall render the entire agreement void. In particular, the provisions of this agreement
10 relating to a property tax transfer under subparagraph 2.2.6 above shall be void and shall be of no force and effect, unless the parties fully comply with other provisions of this agreement."
11

12 In addition to an express recognition that the property tax transfer provisions of the Property
13 Tax Exchange Agreement, which are located in Section 2.2.6, are independent of the other
14 provisions of the Property Tax Exchange Agreement, this provision to the extent that it coerces
15 compliance with an otherwise unlawful and unenforceable condition and requirement of the
16 Property Tax Exchange Agreement, is likewise void, unlawful, and unenforceable.

17 38. The City is informed and believes, and alleges thereon, that the City completed its
18 annexation of the Base, specifically including the Site and the 100-Acre Parcel, in January 2004.

19 39. On or about October 12, 2004, the City entered into a development agreement with
20 the developers of the remainder of the former Base property, which was amended in December 2010
21 (the Amended and Restated Development Agreement, or "ARDA").

22 40. As set forth in the ARDA and evidenced by the Site's General Plan and zoning
23 designations, as well as other long-range planning documents (e.g., the Southern California
24 Association of Governments' Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy
25 ("SCAG's RTP/SCS")), the Site has long been planned for approximately 44 acres of exclusive
26 agriculture and preserved open space uses resulting in a maximum of 88 average daily trips
27 ("ADTs"). The 100-Acre Parcel has long been planned for approximately 300,00 square feet of low
28 impact governmental/institutional uses resulting in a maximum of 6,916 ADTs.

a 41. However, by 2014, the County had drastically changed its long-standing position,
2 and began processing the massive mixed use 100-Acre Project. Even the so-called "reduced

4 density" version of the 100-Acre Project that was ultimately approved by the Board would result in
the development of thousands of dwelling units and millions of square feet of office, retail and hotel
5 uses, which will result in 35,719 ADTs, approximately five times the amount of traffic that has long

6 been planned for and allocated to the 100-Acre Parcel. The County unilaterally decided to make
7 this significant change to the well-established long-term plan for the 100-Acre Parcel, steadfastly
8 refusing to allow the City to assert any authority, land use or otherwise, over the 100-Acre Project.

9 42. The Project challenged here, which was processed concurrently with the 100-Acre
10 Project, proposed the development of over 800 dwelling units, which will result in 4,963 ADTs,
11  over fifty-six times the amount of traffic that has long been planned for and allocated to the Site.
12 Again, the County unilaterally decided to make this significant change to the well-established long-

13 term plan for the Site, steadfastly refusing to allow the City to assert any authority, land use or
14 otherwise, over the Site.

15

16 The County's Processing and Approval of the 100-Acre Development Plan

43. On or about January 28, 2014, the Board approved a Disposition and Development
17 Agreement ("DDA") with Lowe, which set up the framework for the development of both the Site
18 and the 100-Acre Parcel with private, for-profit residential, office, retail and hotel uses, whereby
19 Lowe would take control of the 100-Acre Parcel from the County pursuant to the Master Ground
20 Lease.

21 44. The City is informed and believes, and alleges thereon, that the County and Lowe
22 collectively prepared the 100-Acre Development Plan to begin the so-called entitlement phase, or
23 "Phase 1". but Lowe was its principal creator. The City is further informed and believes, and alleges
24 thereon, that nothing in the County's Zoning Code authorizes a "development plan" entitlement,
25 which appears to have been created by Lowe and the County specifically the challenged Project and
26 the 100-Acre Project. In substance, both Development Plans are substantially similar to a specific a
27 plan.

28 45.

Rutan & Tucker, LLP On or about November 7, 2014, the County released the Notice of Preparation ("100-

Exhibit 1, Page 15

1  Acre NOP") of a program environmental impact report ("PEIR") to purportedly analyze the impacts
2 of the development of the 100-Acre Parcel permitted by the proposed 100-Acre Development Plan.
3 The 100-Acre Development Plan referenced in the 100-Acre NOP and ultimately analyzed as the

4 "project" in the Final PEIR ("FPEIR") would have allowed the development of the Site with

5 1,876,000 square feet of office uses, 2,103 dwelling units, 220,000 square feet of retail, and 242
6 hotel rooms (the "100-Acre NOP Project").

7 46. Under Table 2 of the 100-Acre NOP, which is entitled "County of Orange Required
8 Approvals," the 100-Acre NOP lists the first required action as the County Planning Commission
making a recommendation to the Board regarding certification of the FPEIR and approval (or denial)

10 of the proposed 100-Acre Development Plan. The County Planning Commission was never
11 permitted to consider or take action on the 100-Acre Project or the FPEIR, and never made any

12 recommendation to the Board.

13 47. On November 4, 2016, the County released the Draft Program EIR No. 620
14 ("DPEIR") (State Clearinghouse No. 2014111019) for public review and comment. The County
15 received many comments from concerned and interested parties pointing out the DPEIR's many

16 significant problems.

17 48. In particular, on December 19, 2016, the City submitted a detailed comment letter
18 containing hundreds of specific comments setting forth the many deficiencies in the DPEIR and
19 resulting violations of CEQA, as well as a cover letter summarizing selected major issues. The
20 City's comment letter also alerted the County to the fact that the 100-Acre Project violated the
21 Property Tax Exchange Agreement, both the City and the County's General Plans (including
22 | Measure W), and the City's Zoning Code (as well as other City Code provisions, standards,
23 requirements and guidelines).

24 49. Among many other things, the City's letter makes clear that the entire premise upon
25 which the County was processing approval of the 100-Acre Development Plan was flawed. The
26 County took the position that regardless of the uses it approved for the 100-Acre Parcel, the 100-
27 Acre Project was entirely exempt from the City's land use authority and all other potentially
28 applicable land use regulations, standards and requirements. No provision of law supports the

Exhibit 1, Page 16

County's position that the proposed 100-Acre Project - a profit generating mixed use development

2 is exempt from all City regulation, the City and County General Plans (including Measure W),
3 and/or the Property Tax Exchange Agreement, As set forth herein, the County has taken the same

4 position in response to similar comments made on Project EIR.

50. In particular, the County's position appears to be based, at least in part, on an
6 incorrect interpretation of Government Code sections 53090 through 53091. Those sections would
7 only be potentially applicable if the 100-Acre Parcel was being used for County governmental uses,
8 and certainly have no application for the proprietary mixed use project approved by Respondents.
9 (See, e.g., Board of Trustee v. City of Los Angeles (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 45, 50.)

10 51. The County's decision to process the 100-Acre Project - and now, the Project -
11 under the assumption that it is not required to comply with the City's General Plan, Zoning Code or
12 other land use regulations, standards, requirements or design guidelines also resulted in the DPEIR
13 failing to analyze certain impacts and improperly concluding that a number of impacts are less than
14 significant, when they are, in fact, significant and require mitigation. Further, the County's flawed
15  premise also resulted in the DPEIR concluding that certain significant impacts are unavoidable,
16 when, in fact, they are avoidable, and can be mitigated to a less than significant level by compliance
17 with City requirements.

18 52. On November 3, 2017, the County posted a Notice of Availability and publicly
19 released the FPEIR (inoluding the Responses to Comments contained therein) which was to be
20 considered by the Board - without County Planning Commission review - a mere eleven (11)
21 calendar days later. The City, other commenters, members of the public, and the Board were all
22 given less than two weeks to review the FPEIR's changes to the DPEIR, its 1,328 pages of
23 Responses to Comments, and its 14,681 pages of new attachments that were not included in the
24 DPEIR. As set forth below, the County followed this same truncated public procedure when
25 approving the Development Plan for the Project.

26 53. The FPEIR's Responses to Comments were, in large part, nonresponsive to the issues
27 raised by the City in its December 19, 2016 letter, and were also nonresponsive to issues raised by
28 other commenting parties. Further, the FPEIR failed to correct any of the deficiencies in the DPEIR

Exhibit 1, Page 17

set forth in the City's December 19, 2016 comment letter.

2 54. Even though the City had an extremely short time frame in which to review the
3 FPEIR - and in particular, its 381 specific responses to the City's comments, along with thirteen

4 "topical responses" to issues raised by the City and others on November 13, 2017, the City

5 submitted another letter to the County, pointing out the many deficiencies that remained in the
6 FPEIR, its inadequate Responses to Comments, and the need for the County to recirculate the FPEIR
7 in light of the significant changes and additions to the FPEIR when compared to the DPEIR.

8 55. On November 14, 2017, despite requests from numerous parties to delay
9 consideration of the Project and FPEIR to allow both the public and the Board adequate time to
10 review the thousands of pages of new material included in the FPEIR, the Board considered the 100-
11 Acre Project at a public hearing. The Board also ignored requests from the public to allow the
12 County Planning Commission to consider the Project and FPEIR first, and make recommendation(s)
13 concerning the same.

14 56. At the Board's November 14, 2017 hearing, staff recommended that the Board certify
15 the FPEIR and approve the 100-Acre Project, although staff recommended that the Board approve
16 the so-called Reduced Intensity and Reduced Density Alternative ("RDA"), discussed as Alternative
173 to the NOP Project in FPEIR. The RDA - and ultimately, the version of the 100-Acre Project that
18 was approved - would allow development of 1,000,000 square feet of office uses, 1,998 dwelling
19 units of residential, 200,000 square feet of retail, and 242 hotel rooms, along with the associated

20 infrastructure,

21 57. Following the public hearing, the Board followed County staff's recommendation
22 approved the Project by a 4-1 vote. As set forth above, the County's approval of the Project
23 consisted of the approval the Resolution, which (a) certified the FPEIR; (b) adopted a Statement of
24 Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations for the FPEIR; (c) adopted an MMRP
25 for the FPEIR; (d) approved the 100-Acre Development Plan, as modified by the RDA set forth as
26 Alternative 3 in the FPEIR; and (e) authorized execution of the Master Ground Lease with Lowe in
27 substantially the same form as is attached to the Resolution.

28 58. Also on November 14, 2017, the County filed an NOD, which provided notice that

Rutan & Tucker, LLP -16-

Exhibit 1, Page 18

1 the Board certified the FPEIR and approved the RDA version of the Development Plan (Alternative
2|3) as the Project.

3 59. As expressly acknowledged by Respondents, the 100-Acre Project as approved will
4 still result in a number of significant, unmitigated impacts. When compared with the 100-Acre NOP
5 Project, the 100-Acre Project as approved does not avoid any significant impacts.

6 60. Accordingly, the Statement of Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding
7 Considerations approved by Respondents, which are not supported by substantial evidence in the
8 record, concluded that the 100-Acre Project would result in significant and unavoidable impacts on
9 (i) air quality; (ii) land use and planning; (iii) population and housing; and (iv) transportation and
10 traffic. A number of these impacts are avoidable, but Respondents unlawfully failed to impose
11  feasible mitigation or adopt a less impactful alternative to reduce those impacts to a less than
12 significant level.

13 61. Further, Respondents' Statement of Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding
14 Considerations are inadequate as a result of the improper conclusion that a number of the 100-Acre
15 Project's impacts are less than significant, when in fact they are significant and must be mitigated.
16 For example, under the City's standards - which the County chose to ignore - the 100-Acre Project's
17 | impacts on recreation are in fact significant, yet they are unmitigated and no finding was made that
18 the 100-Acre Project's impacts on recreation are outweighed or overridden by the Project's
19 purported benefits.

20 The County's Processing and Approval of the West Alton Development Plan

21 62. The City is informed and believes, and alleges thereon, that the County and Lowe
22 collectively prepared the Development Plan, but Lowe was its principal creator. The City is further
23 informed and believes, and alleges thereon, that nothing in the County's Zoning Code authorizes a
24 "development plan" entitlement, which appears to have been created by Lowe and the County
25 specifically for this Project and the 100-Acre Project. As alleged above, the Development Plan is
26 substantially similar to a specific plan.

27 63. On or about December 19, 2014, the County released the Notice of Preparation
28 (*NOP") of an environmental impact report ("EIR") to purportedly analyze the impacts of the

Pd development of the Site permitted by the proposed Development Plan. The Development Plan
2 referenced in the NOP would have allowed 970 multi-family units at with an average density of
3 approximately 30 units per acres (the "NOP Project"). Ultimately, the FEIR analyzed an 803 unit
4 (multi-family development with an average density of approximately 25 units per acre.

5 64. Under Table of the NOP, which is entitled "County of Orange Required
6 Approvals," the NOP lists the first required action as the County Planning Commission making a
7 recommendation to the Board regarding certification of the FEIR and approval (or denial) of the
8 proposed Development Plan. However, the County Planning Commission was never permitted to
9 consider or take action on the Project or the FEIR, and never made any recommendation to the

10 Board.

11 65. On December 9, 2016, the County released the Draft EIR No. 621 ("DEIR") (State
12 Clearinghouse No. 2014121065) for public review and comment. The County received many
13 comments from concerned and interested parties pointing out the DEIR's many significant
14 problems. A number of commenters appeared to be shocked by both the Project's proposed use
15 when compared to what has long been publicly planned for the Site as well as the complete disregard
16 for the Wildlife Corridor that runs through the middle of the Project, and the Project's resulting
17 significant impacts on biological resources.

18 66. In particular, on February 9, 2017, the City submitted a detailed comment letter
19 containing hundreds of specific comments setting forth the many deficiencies in the DEIR and
20 resulting violations of CEQA, as well as a cover letter summarizing selected major issues. Again.
21 the City's comment letter also alerted the County to the fact that the Project violated the Property
22 Tax Exchange Agreement, both the City and the County's General Plans (including Measure W),
23 and the City's Zoning Code (as well as other City Code provisions, standards, requirements and
24  guidelines).

25 67. Among many other things, the City's letter makes clear that the entire premise upon
26 which the County was processing approval of the Development Plan was flawed. The County has
27 taken the position that regardless of the uses it approves for the Site, the Project is entirely exempt
28 from the City's land use authority and all other potentially applicable land use regulations, standards

1 and requirements. No provision of law supports the County's position that the proposed Project -
2 a profit generating residential development - is exempt from all City regulation, the City and County
3 General Plans (including Measure W), and/or the Property Tax Exchange Agreement.

4 68. In particular, as was the case with the 100-Acre Project, the County's position

5 appears to be based, at least in part, on an incorrect interpretation of Government Code sections

6 53090 through 53091. Those sections would only be potentially applicable if the Site was being

7 used for County governmental uses, and certainly have no application for the private, for-profit

8 residential Project approved by Respondents here. (See, e.g., Board of Trustee v. City of Los Angeles
9 (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 45, 50.)

10 69. The County's decision to process the Project under the assumption that the Project is
11 not required to comply with the City's General Plan, Zoning Code or other land use regulations,
12 standards, requirements or design guidelines also resulted in the DEIR failing to analyze certain
13 impacts and improperly concluding that a number of impacts are less than significant, when they
14 are in fact significant and require mitigation. Further, the County's flawed premise also resulted in
15 the DEIR concluding that certain significant impacts are unavoidable, when in fact they are
16 avoidable, and can be mitigated to a less than significant level by compliance with City
17 requirements.

18 70. The City's letter further pointed out that the Project EIR. engages in "piecemealing"
19 by segmenting the environmental review of the Project and the 100-Acre Project into two separate
20 EIRs. Indeed, the EIRs were even processed concurrently, as both the draft and final EIR for the
21 Project were released mere months after the draft and final EIR for the 100-Acre Project were
22 released, respectively. As a result, the true impacts of the Project were not fully analyzed and
23 mitigation measures that may have mitigated potentially significant impacts could not be imposed.

24 71. The City's letter also notes that the DEIR's discussion of so-called "Development
25 Plan measures" consistently and unlawfully compresses its impact analysis with its analysis of
26 mitigation measures. As a result, the DEIR improperly concludes that a number of impacts are less
27 than significant without first providing a full discussion and analysis of the potential impact before
28 the implementation of any Development Plan measures.

Exhibit 1, Page 21

1 72: The City's comments also pointed out a significant number of legal deficiencies
2 (both CEQA and otherwise), factual errors, incomplete analysis and other problems with the DEIR.
3 In particular, the City detailed the DEIR's many deficiencies relating to its analysis and conclusions
4 regarding the Project's impacts on aesthetics, air quality, biological resources, geology and soils,

5 greenhouse gas emissions, hazards and hazardous materials, hydrology and water quality, land use
6 and planning, light and glare, noise, population and housing, public services, recreation/parkland,
7 transportation and traffic, cumulative impacts, and project alternatives.

8 73, The City's letter, as well as a comment letter from the United States Fish and Wildlife
9 Service, also pointed out that the Project will have a severely detrimental impact on the viability of
10 the Wildlife Corridor by placing high density residential uses directly adjacent to the Wildlife
11 Corridor and incorrectly states that the impact is less than significant. As a result, the a DEIR does
12 not study meaningful alternatives and fails to provide mitigation measures that mitigate the
13 potentially significant impacts.

14 74. On May 25, 2018, the Friday before the Memorial Day weekend, the County posted
15 a Notice of Availability and publicly released the FEIR (including the Responses to Comments
16 contained therein) which was to be considered by the Board - without County Planning Commission
17 review-a mere eleven (11) calendar days later. The City, other commenters, members of the public,
18 and the Board were all given less than two weeks to review the FEIR's changes to the DEIR, its 694
19 pages of Responses to Comments, and its 19,930 pages of new attachments that were not included
20 in the DEIR.

21 75. The FEIR's Responses to Comments were, in large part, nonresponsive to the issues
22 raised by the City in its February 9, 2017 letter, and were also nonresponsive to issues raised by
23 other commenting parties. Further, the FEIR failed to correct any of the deficiencies in the DEIR
24 discussed above and set forth in the City's February 9, 2017 comment letter concerning the same.

25 76. Even though the City had an extremely short time frame in which to review the FEIR

26 and in particular, its 234 specific responses to the City's comments, along with eleven "topical

3 77. The City's June 4, 2018 letter summarized and cited to a number of specific

4 responses to comments in the FEIR that are legally inadequate (see, Pub. Res. Code §§ 21153, 2109
5 & 21092.5; CEQA Guidelines § 15088), including responses to the City's comments concerning
6 land use, recreation/parkland, traffic and transportation (specifically including, inter alia, responses
7 to the City's comments concerning the North Irvine Transportation Mitigation ("NITM") program,
8 traffic thresholds, traffic generation assumptions, the scoping of the traffic impact analysis ("TIA"),
9 and cumulative impacts), biological resources and the Wildlife Corridor, piecemeal environmental
10 review, greenhouse gas emissions, air quality, noise, the Development Plan/Project descriptions,
11 and the alternatives analysis. The City's June 4, 2018 letter also asserted that, at a minimum, the a
12 FEIR sections related to affordable housing, traffic and transportation (including new appendices
13 concerning the same), greenhouse gas emissions, and hydrology and water quality must be
14 recirculated pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21092.1 and CEQA Guidelines section
15 15088.5.

16 78. On June 5, 2018, despite requests from numerous parties to delay consideration of
17 the Project and FEIR to allow both the public and the Board adequate time to review the thousands
18 of pages of new material included in the FEIR, the Board considered the Project at a public hearing.
19 The Board also ignored requests from the public to allow the County Planning Commission to
20 consider the Project and FEIR first, and make recommendation(s) concerning the same.
21 79. At the Board's June 5, 2018 hearing, County staff recommended that the Board
22 certify the FEIR and approve the Project as proposed with 803 multi-family residential units.
23 80. Following the public hearing, the Board followed County staff's recommendation
24 approved the Project by a 3-1 vote. As set forth above, the County's approval of the Project
25 consisted of the approval of the Resolution, which (a) certified the FEIR; (b) adopted a Statement
26 of Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations for the FEIR; (c) adopted an MMRP
27 for the FEIR; and (d) approved the Development Plan,
28 81. Also on June 5, 2018, the County filed an NOD, which provided notice that the Board

Exhibit 1, Page 23

1 certified the FEIR and approved the Development Plan as the Project.

2 82. As expressly acknowledged by Respondents, the Project as approved will result in a
3 number of significant, unmitigated impacts. In particular, the Statement of Facts, Findings and
4 Statement of Overriding Considerations approved by Respondents, which are not supported by
5 substantial evidence in the record, concluded that the Project would result in significant and
6 unavoidable impacts on (i) air quality; (ii) land use and planning; (iii) population and housing;
7 (iv) transportation and traffic; and (v) hydrology and water quality. A number of these impacts are
8 avoidable, but Respondents unlawfully failed to impose feasible mitigation or adopt a less impactful
9 alternative to reduce those impacts a to a less than significant level.

10 83. Further, Respondents' Statement of Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding
11 Considerations are inadequate as a result of the improper conclusion that a number of the Project's
12 impacts are less than significant, when in fact they are significant and must be mitigated. For
13 example, under the City's standards - which the County chose to ignore - the Project's impacts on
14 | recreation are in fact significant, yet they are unmitigated and no finding was made that the Project's
15 impacts on recreation are outweighed or overridden by the Project's purported benefits. The
16 Project's impacts on biological resources are also significant, and must be mitigated.

use by, inter alia, incorrectly assuming that the Project is exempt from City regulation

2 (including the City's General Plan, Zoning Code, and all other standards, requirements,

3 regulations and guidelines), failing to analyze the Project's consistency with the County's
General Plan (including Measure W). The FEIR further fails to make a good-faith effort at
fully disclosing the Project's conflicts with applicable land use plans, policies and
1o regulations and the resulting impacts;

7 B. The FEIR fails to impose feasible mitigation relating to its impacts on land

8 use, and/or adopt a feasible alternative that would reduce such impacts, instead relying solely
o on vague and uncertain future amendments of the City's General Plan, Zoning Code,
10 SCAG's RTP/SCS and other applicable land use documents and regulations, which does not

11 actually modify the Project or lessen its impacts;

12 C. The FEIR's comparisons of the Project to the City's 8.1 Trails and Transit-

13 Oriented Development ("TTOD") zoning designation are misleading, inaccurate and fail to

14 disclose the actual extent of the Project's impacts, and in particular, the full extent of its

15 inconsistency with the City's TTOD Zoning, including but not limited to fact that the many

16 uses, heights, and densities permitted by the Project would not be permitted or appropriate

17 if the Project was governed by the City's TTOD Zoning. For this reason, among others, the
18 FEIR's project description (and description of the Development Plan) is misleading and

19 inaccurate;

20 D. The FEIR improperly refuses to use City's General Plan, Zoning Code and

21 other standards, requirements, regulations or guidelines as thresholds of significance, which
22 results in an underestimation of impacts and incorrect conclusions regarding the significance

23 of such impacts, including but not limited to the Project's impacts on air quality, aesthetics,

24 biological resources, land use, recreation/parkland, public services, utilities and service

25 systems, population and housing, greenhouse gas emissions, hazards and hazardous

26 materials, noise, protected natural resources, and traffic/transportation. Accordingly, the

27 FEIR fails to properly identify, disclose and mitigate a number of significant impacts;

28 E. Based on its refusal to use City requirements and standards as thresholds of

Exhibit 1, Page 25

- significance, the FEIR improperly concludes that the Project's impacts on parkland would

2 be less than significant because the Project would provide approximately 4 acres of parkland,

3 which complies with County standards. However, City standards require approximately
7.99 acres of parkland, meaning that under the correct threshold of significance, the Project's

5

6 impacts on parkland are significant, and must be mitigated. Further, the FEIR improperly
considers setbacks (or "Focal Gardens" and "Pocket Parks") to be parkland, which do not

7 qualify as such under City (or even County) standards. In sum, the FEIR's conclusion that

8

9 the Project's impact on parkland is less than significant is not supported by substantial
evidence;

10 F.

11 The FEIR also refuses to require compliance with City requirements and

12 standards relating to traffic and transportation, nor does it analyze the Project's impacts using

13 City standards as thresholds of significance, resulting in additional undisclosed significant

14 impacts. In particular, the FEIR does not comply with the City's Traffic Impact Analysis

15 Guidelines (resulting in, among other things, a stale traffic analysis) and fails to accurately

16 describe or implement the City's level of service ("LOS") standards, allowance policy or

17 traffic significance thresholds, which require mitigation back to an acceptable LOS

18 regardless of the ICU increase, unless the baseline condition is already at an unacceptable

19 LOS, in which case the threshold of 0.02 or greater ICU increase applies. The FEIR also

20 fails to disclose the Project's significant impact resulting from its inconsistency with the
ARDA's ADT budget for the site, which the Project will exceed fifty-six times over;
21 G. The FEIR also fails to

22 disclose all impacts, improperly defers

23 mitigation/imposes uncertain mitigation, and fails to adopt available, feasible mitigation

24 relating to the Project's impacts on traffic and transportation by, among other things,

25 erroneously assuming that the Project can participate in the NITM program, and by failing
to address what happens if County is unable to reach agreement with the City and/or Caltrans

26 regarding traffic mitigation measures;

27 H. The FEIR further improperly refuses to acknowledge and/or fails to disclose

28 that the Project is responsible for one hundred percent of the improvement costs for all

intersections impacted by the Project except for those with fully funded NITM

2 improvements (and in the case of partially funded NITM locations, one hundred percent of
m t the unfunded balance), and defers feasible mitigation by not requiring such funding as
mitigation for both project level and cumulative impacts;

I. The FEIR improperly compresses its discussion of potential project impacts
with mitigation measures, when it is instead required to first analyze a potential impact

7 without mitigation, reach a significance conclusion, and then develop and impose mitigation

8 measures. (See, Lotus v. Department of Transportation (2014) 3 Cal.App.4th 654). The
o FEIR does this by relying on the implementation of "Development Plan measures" to reduce

10 impacts to a less than significant level without mitigation, and does not discuss the potential

11 Project impacts without/before the implementation of the "Development Plan measures,"

12 which appear to be, in substance, CEQA mitigation measures. In particular, this defective

13 analysis is present in the FEIR's analysis of impacts related to aesthetics, hazardous and

14 hazardous materials, hydrology and water quality, light and glare, noise and public services,

15 as well as other areas of the FEIR;

16 J. The FEIR fails to study an adequate and/or reasonable range of alternatives.

17 In particular, the FEIR failed to adequately analyze an alternative that minimizes the impacts

18 on the Wildlife Corridor by not developing the area north of the Wildlife Corridor
19 developing non-residential uses south of the Wildlife Corridor;

20 K. The FEIR's analysis of the Project's impacts on aesthetics is incomplete, does

21 not disclose all impacts, defers mitigation, and its conclusion that the Project will result in a

22 less than significant impact on aesthetics is not supported by substantial evidence;

23 L. The FEIR's analysis of the Project's impacts on biological resources is

24 incomplete, does not disclose all impacts, defers mitigation, and its conclusion that the

25 Project will result in a less than significant impact on aesthetics is not supported by

26 substantial evidence;

27 M. The FEIR's analysis of the Project's impacts on air quality is incomplete,

28 does not disclose all impacts (including but not limited to emissions from the nearby

1 - railway), defers mitigation, improperly relies on future revisions to the Air Quality
2 Management Plan ("AQMP*) to conclude that the Project would not obstruct

implementation of the AQMP, and its conclusion that a number of air quality impacts will
be less than significant is not supported by substantial evidence;

N. The FEIR's analysis of the Project's impacts on geology and soils is
6 incomplete, does not disclose all impacts, defers mitigation, and fails to separately analyze

7 short term and long term impacts;

8 O. The FEIR's analysis of the Project's impacts from greenhouse gas emissions

9 is incomplete, does not disclose all impacts, defers mitigation, and among other things,
10 improperly amortizes construction period greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in

11 understating the Project's impacts. As a result, the FEIR's conclusion that the Project's

12 impacts from greenhouse gas emissions are less than significant is not supported by

13 substantial evidence;

14 P. As discussed above, the FEIR'S analysis of the Project's impacts related to

15 land use is incomplete, does not disclose all impacts, defers mitigation, and its impact

16 conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence;

17 Q. As discussed above, the FEIR's analysis of the Project's impacts related to

18 recreation is incomplete, does not disclose all impacts, defers mitigation, and its conclusion

19 that such impacts would be less than significant is not supported by substantial evidence;
20 R. The FEIR's analysis of the Project's impacts on public services is incomplete,

21 does not disclose all impacts, defers mitigation, and its conclusion that such impacts would

22 be less than significant is not supported by substantial evidence, particularly because the

23 FEIR relies on the City's public services (e.g., police and fire services) without requiring

24 compliance with City Code, standards and requirements, nor does it impose any contribution

25 for funding for additional services required by the Project as mitigation;

26 S. As discussed above, the FEIR's analysis of the Project's impacts related to

27 traffic and transportation is incomplete, does not disclose all impacts, defers mitigation, and

28 its impact conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence. The FEIR also fails to

1 mitigate the Project's cumulative impacts on traffic and transportation;
2 T. The FEIR's analysis of the Project's impacts related to biological resources,
3 hazards and hazardous materials, hydrology and water quality, light and glare, noise,
4 population and housing, and utilities and service systems is incomplete, does not disclose all
5 impacts, defers mitigation, and its conclusion that such impacts would be less than
6 significant is not supported by substantial evidence;

7 U. The FEIR's analysis of the Project's cumulative impacts related to all
8 environmental issue-areas/impact categories does not disclose all impacts, defers mitigation,
9 and its impact conclusions concerning the same are not supported by substantial evidence;
10 V. The FEIR contains improper deferral of environmental analysis, such that the
11 full scope of environmental impacts was neither analyzed nor disclosed nor mitigated prior
12 to the certification of the FEIR, and there is an absence of substantial evidence demonstrating
13 the adequacy of mitigation to reduce the Project's potentially significant environmental
14 impacts to a level of insignificance;

15 W. The FEIR improperly defers of mitigation, such that the efficacy of mitigation
16 cannot be adequately judged and, therefore, the conclusion that various impacts are
17 "*mitigated to below a level of significance" cannot be verified, and improperly relies on
18 mitigation that has no articulated standards;

19 X. The FEIR's decision to rely on thresholds of significance not based on or in
20 conflict with City Code, requirements, standards, or guidelines is not supported by
21 substantial evidence;

22 Y. Respondents' Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations
23 approved by Respondents are legally and factually deficient, and not supported by
24 substantial evidence in the administrative record. Respondents also failed to adopt findings
25 to justify the Project's unmitigated, significant impacts in a number a of areas because the
26 FEIR improperly concluded that those impacts are less than significant, including but not
27 limited to impacts on land use, greenhouse gas emissions, public services and
28 recreation/parkland;

2 The FEIR's Responses to Comments are nonresponsive and/or otherwise

u A 0 legally inadequate, specifically including, but not limited to, the Responses to Comments
regarding land use, recreation/parkland, traffic and transportation, greenhouse gas
emissions, air quality, noise, the Development Plan/Project descriptions, and the EIR's

6 alternative analysis, in violation of CEQA and CEQA Guidelines section 15088 in particular;

AA.

7 Significant new information was added to the FEIR, as compared to the

8 DEIR, such that it was required to be recirculated for public review and comment, pursuant

9 to CEQA Guidelines section 15088.5. The significant new information in the FEIR includes,

10 but it is not limited to, additional information relating to the Project's impacts on affordable
housing, traffic and transportation, and greenhouse gas emissions.

11 BB.

12 The FEIR improperly segmented and/or piecemealed its analysis by

13 analyzing the Project's impacts separately from the similar, recently approved mixed use

14 development of the 100-Acre Parcel (the 100-Acre Project), which is proposed by the same

15 developer (Lowe) under the same flawed theory that the County's former Base properties

16 are exempt from all land use regulation. The Project and the 100-Acre Project were covered

17 under the same DDA and the Project's DEIR and the DPEIR for the 100-Acre Project were

18 released in close succession, as was the Project's FEIR and the FPEIR for the 100-Acre

19 Project. The development of both the Site and the 100-Acre Parcel should be analyzed

20 together, and the County's failure to do so has resulted in a lack of disclosure and analysis

21 of the full impacts of both the Project and the previously approved 100-Acre Project.

87. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion
22 by certifying an EIR that does not comply with the requirements of CEQA. As such, Respondents'
23 certification of the FEIR and approval of the Project must be set aside, Respondents' approval of
24 the Resolution rescinded, and the Court should enjoin Respondents and Lowe from taking any
25 further action with respect to the Project, until a timely writ of mandate is returned to this Court in
26 compliance with CEQA, and the other applicable land use regulations violated by Respondents and
27 Lowe.

2 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

3 (Writ of Mandate - Inconsistency with the City General Plan and Zoning Code)

88. The City realleges and incorporates by this reference each and every allegation
4 contained in paragraphs 1 through 87 above.

5 89. All public agencies, including the County, have a mandatory duty to refuse to
6 approve any private development project that is inconsistent with the General Plan of the City or
7 County in which the development project is located. Likewise, all public agencies have a mandatory
8 duty to refuse approval of any private development project that is inconsistent with the relevant
9 property's zoning designation.

10 90. There is no dispute that the Site is located within the jurisdiction of the City, and has
11 been since it was annexed into the City in 2004.

12 91. As acknowledged in the DEIR, the City's General Plan Land Use Element designates
13 the Site as Orange County Great Park (PA 51) and contemplates no development on the Site. The
14 803 multi-family unit residential development proposed by the Project is clearly inconsistent with
15 the City's General Plan.

16 92. As acknowledged in the DEIR, the City's Zoning Map identifies the Project site as
17 1.1, Exclusive Agricultural, and 1.4, Preservation Area. The Exclusive Agriculture zoning district
18 applies to land designated for agricultural use. The only permitted uses within the 1.1 zoning district
19 are agricultural and accessory uses. The Preservation zoning district is intended to protect and
20 maintain natural resources by permanently preserving its natural state with little to no modification.
21 The permitted uses in the 1.4 zoning district are accessory uses, agriculture, caretaker's quarters,
22 manufactured structure for up to two a years, and a wireless communication facility, The Project is
23 likewise clearly inconsistent and does not comply with its Exclusive Agriculture and Preservation
24  zoning designation.

25 93. The County does not contend that the Project is consistent with the City's General
26 Plan or Zoning, but instead relies on an argument that "the Project is not required to comply with
27 the City or County General Plan policies or other similar plans and regulations."

28 94.

uses that will be developed by Lowe, a private developer, the Project is in fact required to comply
2 with the City's General Plan, as well as the City's Zoning Code, requirements, standards, policies,

3 and other "similar plans and regulations", The Property Tax Exchange Agreement, Government
4 Code sections 53090 and 53091, or any other provision that would purport to provide the County

5 and/or Lowe with immunity from the City's General Plan, Zoning Code, and other City regulations
6 do not apply and/or extend to a private developer or private project, like the Project here. The FEIR,
7 and other documents relating to the Project make clear that the Project is Lowe's private
8 development, and a the County is not a partner nor in a public private partnership with Lowe.
9 95. Accordingly, because the Project is plainly inconsistent with the City's General Plan
10 and does not comply with the Site's Exclusive Agriculture and Preservation zoning designation
11 (neither of which are disputed), and a writ must issue overturning Respondents' approval of the
12| Resolution. The County has abused its discretion by approving the Project.

13 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

14 (Writ of Mandate - Inconsistency with the County General Plan)

15 96. The City realleges and incorporates by this reference each and every allegation
16 contained in paragraphs 1 through 95 above.

17 97. Respondents have a mandatory duty to comply with the County General Plan, and

18 refuse to approve any development project that is inconsistent with its Land Use Element.

19 98. The Project, as approved, authorizes uses of the Project that are not permitted by, and
20 are inconsistent with, the County's General Plan, as amended by Measure W.

21 99. The County has taken the position that, pursuant to the Property Tax Exchange
22 Agreement, is permitted to "place any development upon said parcels the County shall determine to
23 be desirable for County's needs, as though said property remained unincorporated." If the Site had
24 "remained unincorporated," then it would be subject to the County's General Plan.
25 100. The County's General Plan was amended by the voters of Orange County through
26 the adoption of Measure W in 2002, approximately 1 year before the City and County entered into
27 the Property Tax Exchange Agreement. Measure W states that it "amends the Orange County
28 General Plan to authorize the closed [Base] to be used for non-aviation uses, including a multi-

1 purpose central park, open space, nature preserve, universities and schools, cultural facility, and
2 other interim and long-term uses described herein." (See, Measure W § A.) Conspicuously absent
3 is any mention of high density multi-family residential uses.

4 101. Indeed, it was contemplated in the public debate that "about 100 acres would stay
5 under County control for various programs and to provide housing for the homeless." The voters
6 have not since voted to amend, change or repeal Measure W.

7 102. Accordingly, even if true that pursuant to the Property Tax Exchange Agreement, the
8 County is somehow entitled to develop the Site with private, for-profit development as if the Site
9 was unincorporated, the Project still is inconsistent with the County's General Plan, and therefore a
10 writ must issue overturning Respondents' approval of the Resolution. The County has abused its
11 discretion by approving the Project.

12 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

13 (Writ of Mandate - Failure to Follow Mandatory Procedures)

14 103. The City realleges and incorporates by this reference each and every allegation
15 contained in paragraphs 1 through 102 above.

16 104. While the "development plan" entitlement does not appear to exist in the County's
17 Zoning Code, it is substantially similar, and for all intents and purposes, a specific plan.

18 105. The County violated its mandatory duties and abused its discretion failing to submit
19 the FEIR and the Project to the County Planning Commission for review and recommendation
it 20 before it was submitted to the Board for review and approval, both in violation of state law and the
21 City and County Codes. (See, Government Code § 65453; County Code § 7-9-5; City Code, Div. 2.)

22 106. The County also violated its mandatory duties and abused its discretion by failing to
23 hold the requisite number of publicly noticed hearings before certifying the FEIR and approving the
24 Project.

25 107. Accordingly, e writ must issue overturning Respondents' approval of the Resolution.

26 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

27 (Breach of Contract and Anticipatory Breach of Contract Against Respondents)

28 108. The City realleges and incorporates by this reference each and every allegation

Rutan & Tucker, LLP -31-

Exhibit 1, Page 33

1 contained in paragraphs 1 through 107 above.

2 109. Respondents' approval of the Project, and particularly the approval of the
3 Development Plan, constitutes an anticipatory material breach and/or a current material breach of
4 Sections 2.2.3 and 2.2.4 of the Property Tax Exchange Agreement in that the approved Development
5 Plan provides for, authorizes, and allows uses of the Site, and portions thereof, which are not

6 *Permitted Uses and Facilities," within the meaning of the Property Tax Exchange Agreement, or
7 otherwise permitted.

8 110. As alleged above, Respondents' approval of the Project authorizes, provides for, and
9 allows uses upon the Site which are inconsistent with, among other things, the City's General Plan,
10 the County's General Plan (including Measure W), the City Zoning Code, the County Zoning Code,
11 or each of them, and, as a result, constitute material anticipatory and/or current breaches of Sections
12 2.2.3 and 2.2.4 of the Property Tax Exchange Agreement.

13 111. The fact that the residential uses proposed by the Project are not "Permitted Uses and
14 Facilities" within the meaning of the Property Tax Exchange Agreement, and conflict with the other
15 land use documents set forth above, is further evidenced by a statement made by the County CEO

16 in an August 22, 2006 letter, in response to the Orange County Grand Jury Report:

17 the County entered into a pre-annexation agreement and property tax agreement with the City of Irvine whereby the County agreed not to oppose Irvine's annexation
18 of the Property. In exchange, Irvine agreed to the County sharing in a certain

19 percentage of the property taxes as well as receipt of certain parcels of property, totaling approximately 240 acres to be used for certain County purposes such as Youth and Family Resource Center, an animal shelter, childcare facilities, law 20 enforcement training facilities, and an emergency shelter."

21 112. The City has complied with each and every material provision of the Property Tax
22 Exchange Agreement.

23 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

24 (Declaratory Relief)

14 C.

15 Sections 2.2.3 and 2.2.4, and each of them, are unlawful, void, and
unenforceable in that they, and each of them:

16 (i) constitute an abdication of the City's police power, a violation of a
17 numerous public hearing, public participation, and transparency requirements, and an unlawful
18 delegation and abdication of the City Council's police power and land use authority in relation to
19 the Site and the 100-Acre Parcel, and each and every portion thereof, and/or an unlawful attempt to

2 E. If, and to the extent, the Property Tax Exchange Agreement is declared void

4 and of no force and effect, the property tax transfer and exchange provisions thereof, as set

un forth in Section 2.2.6, shall revert to the operative provisions set forth in the Master Property

7 F. If, and to the extent, the Property Tax Exchange Agreement is declared void

9 and of no force and effect pursuant to Section 5 thereof, or any other reason, County, its
designees, lessees, or concessionaires, shall re-convey the Site and the 100-Acre Parcel, and

17 actual controversy exists as to each and every allegation and declaration therein.

18 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

19 (Injunctive Relief)

20 116. The City realleges and incorporates by this reference each and every allegation
21 contained in paragraphs 1 through 115 above.

22 117. If, and to the extent, it is determined that Respondents' approval of the Project and/or
23  the implementation thereof, are violative of law, for whatever reason, the City does, and will,
24 possess no effective legal remedy by way of damages or otherwise.

25 118. If, and to the extent, the approval of the Resolution is deemed to violate law, for
26 whatever reason, the City, as a legal entity, will be irreparably harmed, both in its individual capacity

27 and as a representative of its residents, for, among other reasons, the reasons set forth below:

28 A.

2

3 B.

D all other police power regulations of the City will be irreparably impaired and infirmed.

5 The Project will interfere with, impair, and otherwise impede the

6 development of the OCGP, and each and every portion thereof, by way of increased traffic,

7 congestion, noise, pollution, irreparable damage to biological resources, and other impacts
which will not be, and cannot be, adequately mitigated given the size, scope, nature, and
composition of the Project.

C.

8

9
10 The Project will adversely impact the quality of life in adjacent areas, if not

11 the entire City, based upon the traffic, congestion, noise, pollution, greenhouse gas,
aesthetics, open space and parkland, irreparable damage to biological resources, and other
negative impacts associated with high density residential properties.
119. Because the County has artificially limited the nature of the Project as to require
12 multiple and sequential additional proceedings, the City would be forced to bring multiplicity of
13 lawsuits in order to address both individual and accumulated adverse impacts related to

15 14 implementation of the Project, and the various components of the Project,

120. The Court should therefore permanently enjoin Respondents and Lowe from
16  implementing the Project, the previously approved development of the 100-Acre Parcel (the 100-
17 Acre Project), or any development of either the Site or the 100-Acre Parcel with uses that are not
18 consistent with the City's existing General Plan, Zoning Code or any other City regulations,
19 standards, requirements or design guidelines.
