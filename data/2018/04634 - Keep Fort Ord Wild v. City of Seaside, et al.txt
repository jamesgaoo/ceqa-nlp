23 Petitioner KEEP FORT ORD WILD alleges as follows:

24 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

25 First Claim for Relief: Violations of the California Environmental Quality Act.

26 Summary and Background

1.
27 This petition is brought under the California Environmental Quality Act

28 (CEQA; Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.), Code of Civil Procedure sections

KEEP FORT ORD WILD V. CITY OF SEASIDE 1
PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 1085 and 1094.5; the California Planning and Zoning Law (Gov. Code, § 65000 et
2 seq.), the California Subdivision Map Act (Gov. Code, § 66410 et seq.), the Fort Ord
3 Reuse Authority Act (Gov. Code, § 67650 et seq.), the Fort Ord Reuse Plan, Seaside's
4 Parks, Recreation and Community Services Plan, and Seaside's zoning ordinance and
5 subdivision ordinance (Seaside Municipal Code, titles 16 and 17.).

6 2. Keep Fort Ord Wild in this petition challenges the actions of the City of
7 Seaside in May 2018 to approve a notice of exemption prepared for the "Parker Flats
8 Apartment Project," approve a purchase and sale agreement and escrow instructions

9 for the sale of existing unused nurses' barracks, approve the division of land, make
10 other related approvals, a and file a notice of exemption for the project. The proposed
11 project is located within the city limits of Seaside on the former Fort Ord.
12 3. The project site is on a large parcel of land designated in the Fort Ord
13 Reuse Plan as a 50-acre Community Park, of which 12 acres were to be developed by
14 the year 2015. Attached as Exhibit A to this petition are Fort Ord Reuse Plan, Reuse
15 Plan Figures 4.3-2 and 4.1-6, which generally show the park location. The wooded,
16 gently rolling hills on the project site are heavily used for free recreation by the
17 residents of the neighboring communities of Seaside, Marina and Salinas and by other
18 persons. According to the 2005 Seaside Park, Recreation and Community Services
19 Plan, Seaside has a regional parks ratio of 0.33 acres per 1000 residents. The plan
20 states that ratio is significantly below the 3.69 acres per 1000 residents average in
21 western communities and significantly below the recommended desired regional
22 parklands standards of 4.77 acres per 1000 residents.

23 4. Fort Ord iS a former United States Army base that closed in 1994, at
24 which time the United States Department of Defense transferred land to governmental
25 entities and other entities. In 1994, the California Legislature enacted the Fort Ord
26 Reuse Authority Act (Gov. Code, § 67650 § et seq.). The primary purpose of the Act
27 was to a create a governmental structure to plan for, finance, and carry out the transfer
28

2
KEEP FORT ORD WILD V. CITY OF SEASIDE PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 and reuse of the base in a cooperative, coordinated, balanced, and decisive manner.

2 (Gov. Code, § 67652.)

3 5. The Fort Ord Reuse Authority (FORA) was created in 1994 to facilitate

4 the transfer and reuse of certain real and other property comprising the Fort Ord

5 military reservation after the reservation's closure. (Gov. Code, § 67650 et seq.) The

6 Legislature designed FORA to sunset on June 30, 2014. (Gov. Code, § 67700, as §
7 enacted.) In approximately 2012, FORA lobbied for and got an extension to June 30,

8 2020. (Gov. Code, § 67700, as amended.) The Fort Ord Reuse Authority is governed

9 by a 13-member Board of Directors that includes two representatives of the City of

10 Seaside. (Gov. Code, § 67660, subd. (a)(8).)
11 6. The Fort Ord Reuse Authority Act charged FORA with the goal and duty
12 of "minimiz[ing] the disruption caused by the base's closure on the civilian economy

13 and the people of the Monterey Bay area," "maintain[ing] and protect[ing] the unique

14 environmental resources of the area," and accomplishing these tasks "in ways that

15 enhance the economy and quality of life of the Monterey Bay community." (Gov. Code,
16 § 67651, subds. (a)-(d).)

17 7. In 1996, FORA released for public review a proposed draft Fort Ord
18 Reuse Plan and a draft environmental impact report on the draft Reuse Plan. In 1997,

19 FORA responded to comments on the draft EIR, added some mitigations, and certified
20 the final environmental documentation for the Fort Ord Reuse Plan. On the basis of

21 the environmental documentation, FORA adopted a Reuse Plan as amended by the
22 environmental documents. FORA incorporated the EIR's mitigation measures into the
23 Reuse Plan text. (See CEQA Guidelines, § 15097, subd. (b).) Public Resources Code
24 section 21081.6, subdivision (b) requires "in the case of the adoption of a plan" that
25 mitigation measures be fully enforceable "by incorporating the mitigation measures into
26 the plan." The Reuse Plan was intended to address, inter alia, land use,
27 transportation, conservation, and recreation in Fort Ord. (See Gov. Code, § 67675,

28 subd. (c).) The Reuse Plan emphasizes that the Reuse Plan land use, policies and
3
KEEP FORT ORD WILD V. CITY OF SEASIDE PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 programs were developed for each resource element in order to alleviate potential

2 impacts and to provide a balanced mix of uses including recreation. The land uses,

3 policies and programs are assigned to the FORA member jurisdictions, including the

4 City of Seaside. According to the Reuse Plan, FORA adopted the Reuse Plan,
5 including all figures, maps, policies and programs incorporated in it, in order to approve
6 implementation of the Reuse Plan. According to FORA, FORA's approval of the Reuse

7 Plan "assumed implementation of the policies and programs as a pre-condition of

8 reuse" of Fort Ord.

9 Jurisdiction and Venue.

10 8. This action is brought pursuant to Public Resources Code §§ 21167,

11 21168, and 21168.5 and Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085 and 1094.5. Venue is

12 proper in the County of Monterey under Code of Civil Procedure §§ 393 and 395.

13 Parties.

14 Keep Fort Ord Wild.

15 9. Petitioner Keep Fort Ord Wild (Petitioner) is an unincorporated

16 association under California law. Petitioner and its members are beneficially interested

17 in the enforcement and application of environmental laws and laws assuring public

18 disclosure and responsible decision making by local governments. Petitioner and its

19 members are beneficially interested in the way and manner that land use decisions are
20 made and in the environmental consequences of development in Fort Ord, including

21 the impacts of the Parker Flats Apartment Project. Petitioner's members live in

22 Seaside, Marina, unincorporated areas of the County of Monterey, and other cities.

23 Petitioner's members recreate frequently at Fort Ord and on the trails and in the
24 woodlands and open areas that are the site of the proposed Parker Flats Apartment

25 Project, and Petitioner's members wauld lose that recreation if those woodlands and

26 open areas are developed as proposed by the project. Petitioner's members value
27 observing and studying wild species including plants and animals at Fort Ord.
28 Petitioner has members who are residents and business owners in the City of Marina

KEEP FORT ORD WILD V. CITY OF SEASIDE PETITION AND COMPLAINT

•

1 and members who are residents and business owners in the former Fort Ord (whether

2 in Seaside, Marina or the unincorporated County) who get their potable water from the
same unsustainable water supply that would be further and additionally pumped to

4 supply the demand of the Parker Flats Apartment Project. The water supply of those
members of Petitioner would be placed at risk by the further pumping for the project.

6 Petitioner's members drive the streets and highways that would be impacted by the

7 Parker Flats Apartment Project, they would bear the impacts of the increased noise

8 from the project, the loss of enjoyment due to the project's development and

9 destruction of the natural environment, including protected species and habitats, and

10 the reduced air quality as a result of the loss of trees and increased traffic. Petitioner's
11 members are interested in the fair and equitable application and enforcement of

12 adopted plans and ordinances, including ordinances designed to provide affordable

13 housing.

14 10. Keep Fort Ord Wild members and representatives participated in the City

15 of Seaside's public process for the review the Parker Flats Apartment Project

16 application by, inter alia, writing letters to the Seaside City Council meeting prior to the

17 Council's final decisions. Keep Fort Ord Wild files this action in the public interest and

18 on behalf of the public. Petitioner has standing to pursue this action.

19 11. Keep Fort Ord Wild has been active in Fort Ord issues for more than six
20 years. Members, supporters and representatives of Keep Fort Ord Wild have spoken
21 at public hearings, attended public meetings, written letters, gotten other interested

22 persons involved, gathered signatures on petitions for referendum and initiative
23 a measures, sponsored a ballot measure, campaigned on measures and candidates, run

24 for elected positions, and actively participated in other ways in the public process
25 regarding civilian reuse of Fort Ord. Members of Keep Fort Ord Wild "in their

26 capacities as Proponents of the Protect Fort Ord Open Space Access Initiative" were

27 sued by a litigant who financially backed the Monterey Downs project; the litigation

28 (Monterey Superior Court, case no. M122980) sought to keep the open space access

5
KEEP FORT ORD WILD V. CITY OF SEASIDE PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 initiative off the ballot. The litigation against the members of Keep Fort Ord Wild was

2 not successful and as a result Monterey County voters were able to vote on the

3 measure. Keep Fort Ord Wild has participated in public hearings held by the City of

4 Seaside with regard to the Parker Flats Apartment Project. Keep Fort Ord Wild and its

5 members regularly participate and speak at hearings regarding actions on Fort Ord,

6 and have for some years informed the Fort Ord Reuse Authority of the failures to

7 comply with the Reuse Plan and the Reuse Plan mitigations, including Seaside's

8 failures to adopt required policies and programs. Since at least 2012, Keep Fort Ord

9 Wild representatives have informed the Fort Ord Reuse Authority that FORA is relying

10 on "paper" water to approve development at Fort Ord and FORA is not adequately

11 protecting the water supply. Keep Fort Ord Wild and its members actively participated

12 in the reassessment of the Fort Ord Reuse Plan. The reassessment was required by

13 the 1998 settlement agreement in the 1997 Sierra Club V. Fort Ord Reuse Authority

14 CEQA litigation arising from the FORA approvals of the Reuse Plan and its EIR. Keep

15 Fort Ord Wild has successfully filed a petition a under the California Public Records Act

16 against the Fort Ord Reuse Authority for public records. As a result of the litigation,

17 FORA produced key public records that FORA had not previously produced and had

18 denied access by the public, including an insurance policy for which FORA had paid

19 approximately $100 million of public funds.

20 City of Seaside and Seaside City Council.

21 12. Respondent City of Seaside is a public agency and a municipal a

22 corporation under the laws of the State of California. Respondent was the lead agency

23 under CEQA for the Parker Flats Apartment Project. Respondent's actions at issue in

24 this case are subject to the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources

9 the fictitiously named respondents DOES 1-100 is a public agency respondent that

10 may claim jurisdiction by law over one or more aspects of the project that is the subject
11 of the claims in this action. Petitioner does not know their true names and therefore

12 names them by such fictitious names. Petitioner will seek leave from the Court to

13 amend this petition to reflect the true names and capacities of DOES 1-100 once they

14 are ascertained.

19 representative of, and with the knowledge, consent, and permission of, and in concert
20 with, each and all of the respondents and within the course, scope, and authority of

22 information and belief that the acts of each of the respondents were fully ratified by
23 each and all of the respondents. Specifically, and without limitation, Petitioner alleges
24 on information and belief that the actions, failures to act, and breaches alleged herein
25 and attributed to one or more of the specific respondents were approved, ratified and

KEEP FORT ORD WILD V. CITY OF SEASIDE PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 17. Seaside's filed a notice of exemption that does not name a "project
2 applicant." (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21167.6.5, subd. (a), 21152, subd. (a).)
3 18. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that
Seaside's record of proceedings in this action refers to "ALFRED P. GLOVER DBA AS
GLOVER ENTERPRISES, A SOLE PROPRIETORSHIP" and that entity a is a recipient

6 of the approvals at issue in this action, as defined in Public Resources Code sections
7 21167.6.5 and 20165, subdivisions (b) and (c), or has asserted an interest in the
8 outcome of the action. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges
9 that Alfred P. Glover DBA as Glover Enterprises is a sole proprietorship doing business
10 in the State of California.

11 19. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that AP
12 GLOVER ENTERPRISES LLC appears in Seaside's record of proceedings for the
13 project at issue referred to at times as "Glover Enterprises LLC" as an entity or person
14 interested in the project and the approvals at issue in this action as defined in Public
15 Resources Code sections 21167.6.5 and 20165, subdivisions (b) and (c) or has
16 asserted an interest in the outcome of the action. Petitioner is informed and believes
17 and on that basis alleges that AP GLOVER ENTERPRISES LLC is a limited liability
18 company registered with the California Secretary of State.
19 20. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that each of
20 the fictitiously named real parties in interest DOES 101 through 200 either claims an
21 ownership interest in the proposed project or has some other cognizable interest in the
22 proposed project such that they may be real parties in interest. Petitioner does not
23 know their true names and therefore names them by such fictitious names. Petitioner
24 will seek leave from the Court to amend this petition to reflect the true names and
25 capacities of DOES 101 through 200 once they are ascertained.
26 21. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that at all times
27 material to the petition, each of the real parties in interest and each of the real parties
28 in interest fictitiously named in this petition, in addition to acting for

8
KEEP FORT ORD WILD V. CITY OF SEASIDE PETITION AND COMPLAINT

himself/herself/itself, and on his/her/its behalf individually, is and was acting as the

2 agent, servant, employee, and representative of, and with the knowledge, consent, and

3 permission of, and in concert with, each and all of the real parties in interest and within

4 the course, scope, and authority of that agency, service, employment, and

5 representation. Petitioner further alleges on information and belief that the acts of each

6 of the real parties were fully ratified by each and all of the real parties. Specifically, and

7 without limitation, Petitioner alleges on information and belief that the actions, failures

8 to act, and breaches alleged herein and attributed to one or more of the specific real

9 parties in interest were approved, ratified and done with the cooperation and

10 knowledge of each and all of the real parties in interest.

11 Inadequate Remedy at Law.

12 22. Keep Fort Ord Wild declares that it has no plain, speedy, and adequate

13 remedy in the ordinary course of law to address the actions of Respondents.

14 Necessity for Temporary Relief.

15 23. If project development is allowed to commence prior to the Court's final
16 judgment on the merits, Keep Fort Ord Wild and the environment will be greatly,

17 permanently and irreparably injured from the resulting unmitigated environmental,

18 aesthetic, recreational, and land use impacts.

19 24. Under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5(g), this Court may issue a

20 stay order during the pendency of the proceedings unless it is satisfied that a stay

21 would be against the public interest. Imposition of a stay would not be against the

22 public interest in that the public will derive no benefit from the project prior to the

23 Court's final judgment.

24 25. Under Code of Civil Procedure section 526, this Court may issue a

25 restraining order or preliminary injunction during the pendency of the proceedings. This
26 temporary relief is warranted because Keep Fort Ord Wild is likely to prevail on the

27 merits and because commencement of physical development activities will cause great

28 and irreparable injury.

9
KEEP FORT ORD WILD V. CITY OF SEASIDE PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 May 2018: The Seaside City Council Actions to Approve the Project.

2 26. On May 16, 2018, Seaside city staff signed a notice of exemption for the

3 project.

4 27. On May 17, 2018, the Seaside City Council considered approving a

5 purchase and sale agreement for the Nurses Barracks project. The agenda item was

6 called a "business item." It was not a public hearing and was not agendized or noticed

7 as a public hearing or as a project approval. The agenda item did not mention CEQA

8 or a notice of exemption. The public had written letters in opposition and expressing

9 concerns about to the proposed agreement. Keep Fort Ord Wild submitted two letters

10 in opposition and asked the city council to consider KFOW's comments before acting.

11 28. At the meeting the city council voted to adopt a resolution approving the

12 purchase and sale agreement. The city council acted in reliance on the claim of a

13 CEQA exemption and a 168-page report on the project that was provided to the city

14 council on May 16, 2018, the day before the council acted.

15 29. The council resolution states in pertinent part as follows:

16 WHEREAS. The City desires redevelopment of the Medical

17 Officer's Barracks; and

18 WHEREAS, the Developer has offered the City a total

19 purchase price of $750,000 for the property in question; and

20 WHEREAS, the City Zoning Administrator has determined
that the project is exempt under the California
21 Environmental Quality Act (CEQA); and
22 WHEREAS, the City desires to sell the Medical Officer's
23 Barracks and the surrounding 4.98 acres of land:

24 NOW, THEREFORE, the Successor Agency hereby finds,

25 determines and resolves as follows:

26 Section 1 . The City hereby approves the terms and

27 conditions of the PSA [Purchase and Sale Agreement], and
all other documents reasonably required to implement the
28

10
KEEP FORT ORD WILD V. CITY OF SEASIDE PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 PSA, as substantially set forth in the form of PSA attached

2 to this resolution.

3 Section 2. The City Council hereby authorizes the City

4 Manager to execute the PSA, including any reasonable
modifications thereto, and authorizes the City Manager to
5 execute all documents reasonably required effect the final

6 sale of the property to the Developer.

7 (Seaside Resolution No. 18-41, attached to this petition as Exhibit B.) Neither the

8 resolution nor the sale contract is contingent on future CEQA compliance.

30. The May 17, 2018 council action was Seaside's first commitment to the

10 project. The language of the council resolution and the approved sales agreement

11 uses language of commitment by Seaside to the project. Seaside is required to comply

12 with CEQA before committing to the project. (Save Tara V. City of West Hollywood

13 (2008) 45 Cal.4th 116.)

14 31. Since late 2017 or early 2018, there has been an increasing amount of
15 development activity at the site including demolition, removal of the windows, removal

16 of the roofs, removal of interior walls, and more. The site is surrounded by construction
17 fencing. The site is not accessible to the public. There was no public communication

18 by Seaside to the public in general or KFOW in particular as to what was happening at

19 the site. KFOW is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that the Real Party

20 has been responsible for the development activity.

21 32. The city council acted to approve a contract of sale of the property even

22 though Seaside does not own the property. The 50-acre property is in the possession

23 of the Fort Ord Reuse Authority. The property is not expected to be turned over to

24 Seaside until 2019, according to Seaside.

25 May 31, 2018: Seaside Filed a Notice of Exemption.

26 33. On or about May 31, 2018, Seaside filed a notice of exemption with the

27 County Clerk. The notice described the project as follows:

28

11
KEEP FORT ORD WILD V. CITY OF SEASIDE PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 Project Description: The proposed project would involve

2 conversion of an existing abandoned military nursing
barracks on the former Fort Ord into residential apartments
3 with 40 dwelling units, including 29 twö-bedroom and 11
4 three-bedroom units. . ... The project site is located on a

5 4.9-acre parcel[.]

6 The notice stated that "The project meets the conditions for an infill exemption" and

7 made other statements. The notice described five conditions intended to mitigate

8 potential impacts to biological resources and traffic.

9 34. Seaside's filing of a notice of exemption triggered a short statute of

10 limitations for litigation under CEQA challenging the project approvals. This action is

11 being filed within the limitations period.

12 35. Petitioner made several efforts to resolve the controversy prior to filing

13 suit. Petitioner submitted written comments identifying its concerns to the Council

14 before the Council acted on May 17, 2018. On June 11, 2018, Petitioner sent a

15 settlement letter to the Mayor and City Council identifying the issues and the dispute

16 over the council actions and proposing resolution of the dispute. On June 13, 2018

17 Petitioner's legal counsel spoke by phone for approximately 45 minutes with the

18 Seaside city manager, who said he had not heard from the Mayor or Councilmembers

19 and had no authority or direction from them to resolve the matter. The city manager

20 stated that Seaside would not hold a special meeting to consider the dispute and

21 settlement offer. He made other comnments, including that Seaside wants to be able to

22 develop the remainder of the property with residential uses. He said he expected to

23 respond further after the next regular council meeting scheduled for the evening of

24 June 21, 2018. On June 22, 2018, the city manager in an email to KFOW stated that

25 the city would place a resolution on the July 5, 2018 council agenda "affirming the

26 City's obligation for a community park as noted in the Fort Ord Base Reuse Plan." The

27 city manager stated that concerns regarding the apartment project scope "will be

28 addressed with conditions at the building permit stage."

12
KEEP FORT ORD WILD V. CITY OF SEASIDE PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 36. On June 22, 2018, Petitioner sent a notice of intent to initiate litigation

2 under CEQA, and on the morning of June 25, 2018, Petitioner sent a second notice of

3 intent to initiate litigation identifying all claims for relief including CEQA. Petitioner's

4 legal counsel spoke for approximately 20 minutes with the city attorney on June 25,

5 2018 and then again for approximately five minutes later that same day. Later on June

6 25, Real Party's counsel contacted Petitioner's counsel and asked to meet. On June

7 26, 2018, in response to Real Party's request, Petitioner's counsel met in person with

8 the Real Party's attorney at his office for approximately an hour. The city attorney

9 joined in the meeting by phone for approximately 20 minutes. Counsel discussed the
10 uncertainty as to future actions by the Seaside city council. In each communication

11 Petitioner emphasized that Seaside had started the clock running when Seaside had

12 filed the notice of exemption on May 31, 2018.

13 37. Petitioner has experienced significant delay in obtaining final written

14 documents of city council actions. For example, on May 22, 2018, Petitioner requested

15 the executed resolution and signed sales agreement acted upon by the council on May

16 17, 2018. Seaside took more than four weeks to produce the signed resolution 18-41

17 documenting the council action; Seaside produced the executed resolution on the

18 afternoon of June 26, 2018.

19 38. Seaside's filing of the notice of exemption has triggered a very a short

20 CEQA statute of limitations on the time to challenge certain actions. Because Seaside
21 has started the clock running, and there is no certainty as to what the council will do
22 and when, and when Petitioner will receive written confirmation of any such actions,

23 Petitioner must file this petition promptly to protect Petitioner's interests and the rights
24 of the public.

25 The California Environmental Quality Act.

26 39. "CEQA is a comprehensive scheme designed to provide long-term
27 protection to the environment," and must be "interpreted 'to afford the fullest possible

28 protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language.' "
13
KEEP FORT ORD WILD V. CITY OF SEASIDE PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 (Mountain Lion Foundation V. Fish & Game Com. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 112.) To

2 achieve its objective of environmental protection, CEQA and the regulatory guidelines
3 implementing it establish a three-tiered structure. If a project falls within a category
4 exempt by administrative regulation or it can be seen with certainty that the activity in
5 question will not have a significant effect on the environment, no further agency
6 | evaluation is required. If there a is a possibility that the project may have a significant

7 effect, the agency undertakes an initial threshold study and if that study demonstrates

8 that the project will not have a significant effect, the agency may sO declare in a brief

9 negative declaration. If the project is a one which may have a significant effect on the
10 environment, an environmental impact report is required. (No Oil, Inc. V. City of Los

11 Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 74; Save Our Carmel River v. Monterey Peninsula Water
12 Management District (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 677.)

13 40. Certain "classes of projects are 'categorically exempt' from CEQA

14 pursuant to administrative regulation because they do not have a significant effect on

15 the environment." (Mountain Lion Foundation V. Fish & Game Com., supra, 16 Cal.4th

16 at pp. 112-113; Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21080, subd. (b)(9), 21084, subd. (a); see

17 Save Our Carmel River v. Monterey Peninsula Water Management District, supra, 141
18 Cal.App.4th 677.)

19 41. Seaside erred in critical ways in adopting a categorical exemption for the
20 apartment project. As one example, Seaside selected the "infill exemption" but that
21 exemption does not apply to this project. The infill exemption is stated in CEQA

22 Guidelines section 15332, which states as follows:

23 15332. In-Fill Development Projects.

24 Class 32 consists of projects characterized as in-fill

25 development meeting the conditions described in this
section.
26

27 (a) The project is consistent with the applicable general plan
designation and all applicable general plan policies as well
28 as with applicable zoning designation and regulations.
14
KEEP FORT ORD WILD V. CITY OF SEASIDE PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 (b) The proposed development occurs within city limits on a

2 project site of no more than five acres substantially
surrounded by urban uses. 3

4 (c) The project site has no value as habitat for endangered,
rare or threatened species.
5 (d) Approval of the project would not result in any significant
6 effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality.
7 (e) The site can be adequately served by all required
8 utilities and public services.

9 Note: Authority cited: Section 21083, Public Resources

10 Code. Reference: Section 21084, Public Resources Code.

11 Discussion: This section is intended to promote infill
development within urbanized areas. The class consists of 12 environmentally benign in-fill projects which are consistent
13 with local general plan and zoning requirements. This class
14 is not intended to be applied to projects which would result

15 in any significant traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality
effects. Application of this exemption, as all categorical
16 exemptions, is limited by the factors described in section
17 15300.2.

18 (CEQA Guidelines are available at http://resources.ca.gov/ceqa/guidelines/art19.html.)

19 42. The project is not consistent with subdivision (a) because the project is

20 not consistent with the designation of the polygon as "Community Park" in the Fort Ord

21 Reuse Plan, which stands with the authority of a general plan for land at Fort Ord. The
22 five-acre "project site" is not consistent with the requirements of the exemption

23 subdivision (b) because the project site is bordered on two sides by undeveloped oak
24 woodlands, and thus is not "substantially surrounded by urban uses." It also is not
25 consistent with subdivision (b) because the project site is more than five acres. The

26 project site is 50 acres, of which Seaside claims it will subdivide a parcel of "4.98

27 acres" for the project. The project is not consistent with subdivision (c) because the
28 50-acre project site has value as habitat for endangered, rare or threatened species,

15
KEEP FORT ORD WILD V. CITY OF SEASIDE PETITION AND COMPLAINT

t and so does the project site, as shown by the two CEQA mitigations to protect
2 biological resources, and the immediately adjacent Coastal oak woodlands. The

3 project is not consistent with subdivision (d) because approval of the project would

4 result in potentially significant effects relating to traffic, as shown by the two CEQA
5 mitigations to address traffic impacts.

6 43. As another example, Seaside adopted at least five conditions to mitigate

7 potential project impacts on traffic and biological resources. An agency cannot mitigate

8 its way into an exemption. "An agency should decide whether a project is eligible for a

9 categorical exemption as part of its preliminary review of the project" without reference

10 to or reliance upon any proposed mitigation measures. (Azusa Land Reclamation Co.

11 V. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1165, 1199-1200.)

12 Only those projects having no significant effect on the environment are categorically

13 exempt from CEQA review. (Pub. Resources Code, §S 21080, subd. (b)(9), 21084,
a 14 subd. (a).) "[A]n activity that may have a significant effect on the environment cannot

15 be categorically exempt." (Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish & Game Com., supra, 16

16 Cal.4th at p. 124.) If a project may have a significant effect on the environment, CEQA

17 review must occur, and only then are mitigation measures relevant. (Azusa, supra, 52

18 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1199-1200.) The determination of whether a project may impact a
19 designated environmental resource must be made without reference to or reliance

20 upon any proposed mitigation measures. (Azusa, supra, 52 Cal.App.4th at pp.
21 1199-1200.) Reliance upon mitigation measures involves an evaluative process of
22 assessing those mitigation measures and weighing them against potential

23 environmental impacts, and that process must be conducted under established CEQA

24 standards and procedures. (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network v. County of

25 Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1108.)

26 44. As another example, exemptions may not be used "when the cumulative
27 impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is
28 significant." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15300.2, subd. (b).) The subdivision of the 50-acre
16
KEEP FORT ORD WILD V. CITY OF SEASIDE PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 site was improperly omitted from the project description which led to the omission of a

2 discussion of the impact of successive subdivisions for residential purposes over time

3 of the 50-acre property. Successive subdivisions are foreseeable because in 2016

4 Seaside approved the Monterey Downs project which included subdivision of the 50-

5 acre site for high density residential uses. More recently, at a Monterey County Board

6 of Supervisors Fort Ord Committee meeting in early 2017 the Seaside city manager

7 told a KFOW representative that Seaside intended to develop the site with residential

8 uses. Additionally, on June 13, 2018 the Seaside city manager explained to KFOW's
legal counsel that Seaside wants to preserve the option of future residential use of the
10 50-acre parcel. The city manager was responding to KFOW's settlement proposal

11 term that Seaside prohibit all subdivision of the 50-acre parcel other than the apartment

12 project site.

13 45. No other CEQA exemption is available for this project, primarily because
14 of the reasons explained in the preceding paragraphs: Seaside has acknowledged that

15 the project has potential impacts when Seaside adopted mitigation measures for traffic

16 and biological resources; the blanket exception for cumulative impacts prohibits the use

17 of an exemption.

18 46. Under the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code,

19 § 21000 et seq.), a public agency must prepare an environmental impact report (EIR)
20 on any project the agency proposes to "carry out or approve" if that project may have
21 significant environmental effects (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21100, subd. (a), 21151,
22 subd. (a).) The EIR must describe the proposed project and its environmental setting,
23 state the objectives sought to be achieved, identify and analyze the significant effects

24 on the environment, state how those impacts can be mitigated or avoided, and identify

25 and analyze alternatives to the project. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21100, subd. (b),
26 21151; CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15124, 15125, 15126.6.)

27 47. Once a public agency has incorporated mitigation measures into the

28 project as mitigations and/or as policies and programs of a plan, as here with the Fort
17
KEEP FORT ORD WILD V. CITY OF SEASIDE PETITION AND COMPLAINT

Ord Reuse Plan, the agency is bound to comply with them. "Having placed these
conditions on the .... project, the [agency] cannot simply ignore them. Mitigating

3 conditions are not mere expressions of hope." (Lincoln Place Tenants Association v.

4 City of Los Angeles (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1491, 1508.) There was no evidence

5 before the Seaside City Council that Fort Ord Reuse Plan policies and programs were
impractical or unworkable. To the contrary, the policies and programs are more

7 necessary than ever to mitigate the development at Fort Ord that has been approved

8 and is in the process of being approved. This includes the parks designated in the

Reuse Plan.

10 48. The public interest in public agencies enforcing their adopted

11 environmental mitigations is high. There is strong public policy and public interest in

12 favor of ensuring an agency's commitment to its CEQA mitigations adopted at the time

:13 of the agency's project approvals. There is strong public policy and public interest in

14 favor of ensuring the compliance with FORA's adopted mitigations for the reuse of Fort

15 Ord. Keep Fort Ord Wild in this action is representing the public and the public interest

16 with regard to the need for an adequate environmental review and adequate mitigation

17 of impacts, and the injury to the public interest will be irreparable if the petition is not

18 heard. (Environmental Law Fund, Inc. V. Town of Corte Madera (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d

19 105, 114-115.) If not redressed, Seaside's May 2018 actions would perpetuate a

20 public wrong and would burden the public of Seaside and the County, in perpetuity,

21 with the effects of the inadequate environmental review.

22 49. Respondent's actions, and each of them, as described above and as

23 shown in the record of proceedings herein, without adequate compliance with the

24 provisions of the CEQA, constitute a prejudicial abuse a of discretion. Respondent failed

25 to proceed in the manner required by law, did not apply or satisfy the procedural and
26 substantive safeguards and requirements of CEQA, did not engage in a legally a

27 sufficient fact-finding endeavor, and did not adequately identify and mitigate impacts.

28 The flaws and inadequacies of the environmental review include a prejudicially
18
KEEP FORT ORD WILD V. CITY OF SEASIDE PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 incomplete and changing project description, a materially inaccurate discussion of the

2 environmental setting and the impacts of the project, the failure to adequately

3 investigate and disclose the impacts of the project, the failure to adequately investigate

4 the baseline conditions including the water supply, the piecemealing of the

5 environmental review so as to exclude the subdivision of the larger parcel, the

6 inadequate analysis of cumulative impacts of the project in combination with
7 foreseeable future subdivisions of the remaining part of the larger parcel, the improper

8 tiering of the environmental impact analysis, the inadequate consideration of

9 mitigations and alternatives, the improper deferral of formulation of mitigation, and the

10 lack of necessary specificity and criteria and performance standards in the mitigations.

11 50. As an example of the flaws, and not as a limitation, Petitioner alleges that

12 Seaside inadequately investigated, quantified and mitigated the project-related
13 | impacts. As another example, and not as a limitation, the Reuse Plan specifically

14 protected oaks woodlands at Fort Ord, stating as follows:

15 Oak Woodland Protection

16 The Oak Woodlands at Fort Ord represent an outstanding

17 environmental asset.

18 A significant amount of these oak woodlands,

19 however, are located in polygons that are designated for
development. It is an objective of the Reuse Plan to
20 accommodate the development programs on these
21 polygons while protecting to the greatest extent possible the
oak woodland resource.
22
"Development Character and Design Objectives" are
23 defined for these polygons in the [Reuse Plan]. In addition,
24 policies and programs to encourage the preservation and

25 enhancement of oak woodland elements in the natural and
building environment are included in . the Reuse Plan.
26
For example, the Fort Ord Reuse Plan Biological Resources policy B-2 and program B-
27 2.1 require Seaside and the County to designate an oak woodlands conservation area
28

19
KEEP FORT ORD WILD V. CITY OF SEASIDE PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 for their land at Fort Ord and to assure those areas are managed to maintain or

2 enhance habitat values, with specific identified management measures. This policy

3 and program are mitigation measures of the Reuse Plan. For nearly 20 years, Seaside

4 has failed to comply with those mandatory policy and program and to designate the

5 oak woodlands conservation area. Instead, Seaside approved the Parker Flats

6 Apartment Project on a CEQA exemption, even though the 50-acre project site

7 contains more than 2,000 oak trees that the Reuse Plan intended to be protected prior

8 to the approval of development.

9 51. Respondent's actions, and each of them, as described above and as
10  shown in the record of proceedings herein, including but not limited to failure to prepare
11 an adequate environmental impact report in compliance with the provisions of the

12 California Environmental Quality Act, constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion in that

13 Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law, did not satisfy the

14 procedural and substantive requirements of CEQA, did not engage in a legally

15 sufficient fact-finding endeavor, did not meet the informational requirements of CEQA

16 and did not adequately identify and mitigate impacts.

17 52. The flaws and inadequacies of the environmental review use an
18 incomplete and inadequate discussion of environmental setting, an inadequate and

19 incomplete project description, an inaccurate baseline, and an inadequate and

20 incomplete investigation, discussion or analysis of potentially adverse impacts to, of,

21 and/or on water supply and availability, water sources, water demand, water recharge,
22 hydrogeology, hydrology, water quality, water contamination, water quality, seawater
23 intrusion, water rights, appropriative rights, pumping, recharge, soil contamination,

24 baselines, rural characteristics, endangered or protected species, biological resources,
25 oak trees, habitats, vegetation types, ecosystems, land use, wildlife linkages, parking,
26 development on slopes, erosion, traffic, transportation, circulation, infrastructure,
27 access, public utilities, wastewater, grading, public services, noise, setbacks, open

28 space, and cultural resources. The flaws and inadequacies of environmental review
20
KEEP FORT ORD WILD V. CITY OF SEASIDE PETITION AND COMPLAI: IT

4

1 include an incomplete and inadequate discussion, investigation, or analysis of
2 cumulative impacts, growth-inducing impacts, piecemealing, inconsistency with Fort

3 Ord Reuse Plan, inconsistency with general plan policies, precedent-setting nature of

4 the approvals, mitigations,, other missing documents, and other defects. These issues,

5 the violations of CEQA, and the potential adverse environmental effects of these

6 violations were not investigated adequately or addressed adequately in the CEQA
7 documentation or by Respondent.

8 53. The flaws and inadequacies of the environmental review include

9 inadequate investigation and discussion of the project's inconsistency with the zoning
10 ordinance, adopted land use plans and the General Plan. The environmental review

11 was piecemealed and environmental review was inappropriately deferred.
12 Respondents failed to incorporate reasonable mitigation measures that would eliminate
13 or substantially reduce the environmental impacts of the project.
14 54. Respondent failed to adopt legally adequate findings as required by law.
15 55. Seaside's environmental review incorrectly characterizes the current
16 baseline and regulatory environment. The analysis of potential impacts of the project
17 was based on inaccurate, unexplained, and inappropriate assumptions. Those
18 assumptions led to incorrect conclusions about potential impacts, including
19 underestimations of the potentially significant impacts, which meant that the true

20 impacts were not disclosed, adequately analyzed or mitigated. Maps used in the
21 CEQA review were inaccurate. Cumulative impacts were not adequately disclosed or
22 mitigated. Seaside's environmental review failed to disclose that the project site is a
23 50-acre parcel and the project includes subdivision of a five-acre parcel. The
24 environmental review failed to disclose that the 50-acre parcel is designated in the Fort
25 Ord Reuse Plan as a "Community Park" and that the Seaside Parks plan relies on the
26 community park acreage to provide much-needed parkland for Seaside residents.
27 56. Petitioner seeks in this action to require Respondent to comply with
28 CEQA in its decisions with regard to the proposed project, to fulfill its statutory
21
KEEP FORT ORD WILD V. CITY OF SEASIDE PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 obligations under CEQA, to provide the information and investigation required by law,

2 to comply with the procedural mandates of CEQA, and to proceed in the manner

3 required by law.

4 57. Petitioner brings this action consistent with the requirements of Public

5 Resources Code section 21177 and Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and/or

6 1094.5. Petitioner objected to Seaside's actions to approve the project in writing prior

7 to the close of the public hearing. Petitioner and/or other agencies, organizations,
and/or individuals raised the legal deficiencies asserted in this petition orally or in

9 writing prior to the close of Seaside's public hearing on the project and prior to

10 Seaside's filings of the notice of exemption.

11 58. Petitioner performed all required conditions precedent to filing this action

12 by complying with the requirement of Public Resources Code section 21167.5 when on

13 June 22, 2018 Petitioner gave written notice by email to Seaside of Petitioner's intent to

14 gave written notice file an action under CEQA, and when on June 25, 2018 Petitioner

15 by email and mail to Seaside of Petitioner's intent to file an action for violations of

16 CEQA, California Planning and Zoning Law, the Fort Ord Reuse Authority Act, the Fort

17 Ord Reuse Plan, the Subdivision Map Act, the Seaside Parks, Recreation and

18 Community Services Plan, and the Seaside municipal code, including the zoning and

19 subdivision ordinances.

20 Second Claim for Relief: Failure to comply with Seaside's Parks, Recreation and
21 Community Services Plan.

22 59. Petitioner incorporates and realleges the preceding paragraphs 1 through

23 58, as if fully set forth herein.

24 60. Seaside's actions and documents, including the findings in the
25 resolutions, are not supported by substantial evidence, use incorrect legal standards,

26 do not comply with the state and local laws including the City of Seaside's Parks,
27 Recreation and Community Services Plan, Zoning Ordinance, and Subdivision

28 Ordinance, and are otherwise not consistent with California Planning and Zoning Law
22
KEEP FORT ORD WILD V. CITY OF SEASIDE PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 (Gov. Code, § 65000 et seq.), and are arbitrary and capricious. Under California

2 Planning and Zoning law, a local public agency may amend its general plan, adopt a

3 specific plan, or entitle a proposed land use only if the amendment, specific plan, or

4 land use is consistent with the goals, policies, and objectives contained in a valid and
5 internally consistent general plan. The Parker Flats Apartment Project is inconsistent

6 with the Fort Ord Reuse Plan and City of Seaside planning documents including

7 ordinances and adopted plans. Seaside did not adopt findings of approval to support

8 its actions and the decision is not supported by substantial evidence and Seaside.

9 prejudicially abused its discretion.

10 61. Seaside's Parks, Recreation and Community Services Plan was adopted

11 by the City Council in October 2005. The plan provides policies for developing and
12 maintaining the park system, and financing of improvements. The Parks plan states

13 that a City Council meeting in March 2005, "Council members discussed the omission
14 in the [Seaside] General Plan of the 50 acre community park site identified in the Fort

15 Ord Reuse Plan, and the intent to include that community park within the Parks,
16 Recreation, and Community Services Plan." (Parks Plan, p. 5.) To that end, the plan

17 discusses Seaside land in Fort Ord and states that the University Planning area

18 includes a subarea called "Community Park - 50 acre community park." The plan

19 section 3.2 "Summary of Findings" concludes, inter alia, as follows:

20 Three additional community parks are needed to serve the

21 Seaside area. Two of these sites have been designated in

22 the Fort Ord Reuse Plan. The third site, Seaside Highlands
Community Park (formerly Soper Field), will be developed
23 as part of the Hayes Housing Development Project.

24 (Parks plan, p. 24, emph. added.) The 50-acre Community Park site is the site from
25 which Seaside has approved subdividing approximately 5 acres as part of its project

26 approvals at issue in this action.
27 Third Claim for Relief: Failure to comply with the Subdivision Map Act and
28 Seaside's Subdivision Ordinance.
23
KEEP FORT ORD WILD V. CITY OF SEASIDE PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 62. Petitioner incorporates and realleges the preceding paragraphs 1 through

2 61, as if fully set forth herein.

3 63. Seaside prejudicially abused its discretion by approving the project in the

4 absence of a subdivision parcel map and tentative map. Seaside has acted to sell

5 approximately five acres of a 50-acre parcel. Seaside has not conditioned that sale on

6 future compliance with the subdivision ordinance. Seaside has acted to divide land, in

7 violation of the provisions of the Seaside subdivision ordinance or of the state

8 Subdivision Map Act. Seaside violated its subdivision ordinance, including the

9 requirements of complying with section 17.20.020.D, which states "Legal parcel. The

10 site of a proposed development or new land use shall be a parcel that was legally

11 created in compliance with the Subdivision Map Act and the City's Subdivision
12 Ordinance." The Map Act prohibits the sale of parcels for which a subdivision map is

13 required. Petitioner seeks to restrain or enjoin any attempted or proposed subdivision

14 for sale, lease or financing in violation of the subdivision ordinance. Seaside's action is

15 ultra vires.

16 Fourth Claim for Relief: Failure to comply with Seaside's Zoning Ordinance
17 64. Petitioner incorporates and realleges the preceding paragraphs 1 through 1

18 63, as if fully set forth herein.

19 65. Seaside prejudicially failed to comply with its zoning ordinance when

20 Seaside failed to notice and hold a public hearing to approve the project. Seaside's

21 zoning code is title 17 of its municipal code. The zoning code requires a public hearing

22 for approvals of development projects and approvals such as the approvals Seaside

23 made on May 17 for this project. Public hearings require materially more notice to the

24 public than the notice Seaside provided for the May 17 meeting.

25 66. Seaside also prejudicially failed to comply with its zoning ordinance when

26 Seaside failed to require affordable housing compliance when Seaside acted on May

27 17, 2018. According to the zoning ordinance, affordable housing compliance and

28 requirements are required at the time of approval of the parcel map and tentative map.
24
KEEP FORT ORD WILD V. CITY OF SEASIDE PETITION AND COMPLAINT

•

The zoning ordinance specifies express requirements, including specific dates for

2 performance and time period duration for which the affordable housing shall remain
3 affordable. These express requirements were not applied to the project.

4 Fifth Claim for Relief: Failure to comply with the Fort Ord Reuse Authority Act

5 and the Fort Ord Reuse Plan.

6 67. Petitioner incorporates and realleges the preceding paragraphs 1 through

7 66 as if fully set forth herein.

8 68. Seaside was required to comply with the Reuse Plan land use

9 designations, policies and procedures that apply to Seaside. The Parker Flats
10 Apartment Project is inconsistent with Reuse Plan, including land use designations,

11 figures, maps, policies and programs intended to provide parks to Seaside and to

12 protect biological resources. Seaside did not adequately identify the inconsistencies or

13 attempt to rectify or condition the project to make the project consistent. Seaside did

14 not make findings to support its actions, its actions are not supported by the evidence

15 and Seaside prejudicially abused its discretion.

16 69. As one example, and not for limitation, under the Fort Ord Reuse

17 Authority Act, Seaside may not approve a development project that is not consistent

18 with the Fort Ord Reuse Plan. Seaside thereby prejudicially abused its discretion

19 under the Act by approving a project that is not consistent with the Reuse Plan and
20 Seaside's actions are not supported by the evidence. Keep Fort Ord Wild's interests

21 and the public interest would be adversely affected by Seaside's actions to avoid its

22 responsibilities as a jurisdiction to adopt the policies and programs that it is required to

23 adopt, while at the same time to claim that the project is consistent with the Reuse
24 Plan.
