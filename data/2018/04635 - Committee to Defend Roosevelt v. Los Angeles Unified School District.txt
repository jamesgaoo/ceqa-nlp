VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

Petitioner, COMMITTEE TO DEFEND ROOSEVELT (*Petitioner"), alleges through

2 this Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declarative and Injunctive Relief

3 ("Petition"), as follows:

4 INTRODUCTION

1. Petitioner challenges the approval by Respondent Los Angeles Unified School
6 District ("District" or "Respondent") of the certification of an Environmental Impact Report
7 ("EIR") and the related project approvals for the Roosevelt High School Comprehensive
8 Modernization Project (the "Project").
2. Petitioner requests that this Court vacate, set aside, rescind and void all of the
10 project approvals adopted by the District in order to facilitate the Project as well as the
11
§ Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") certified by the District.. The Project was approved by the Channel Law Group, d17 LI-Z06 requests that the Court vacate all applicable projects SII!H EI  VPIES TH H MA IR A SAZ 8 Beverly 12 District on or about May 8, 2018. Petitioner
13 approvals because Respondent failed to comply with the provisions set forth under the California
14 Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000, et seq. ("CEQA") and
15 applicable state laws and therefore failed a to proceed in a manner required by law.
16 3. Petitioner seeks a Peremptory Writ of Mandate under California Code of Civil
17 Procedure section 1094.5, directing Respondent to vacate, rescind and set aside all project
18 approvals and the certification of the EIR because Respondent failed to comply with CEQA.
19 PARTIES

20 4. Petitioner, Committee to Defend Roosevelt, is an association dedicated to the
21 protection of both the community and the environment in the Boyle Heights neighborhood in the
22 City of Los Angeles. Petitioner and its respective members have a direct and substantial
23 beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondent complies with laws relating to environmental
24 protection. Petitioner and its respective members are adversely affected by Respondents' failure
25 to comply with CEQA in approving the Project. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims
26 raised in this Petition because Petitioner and its members' aesthetic and environmental interests

27

28 2

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 are directly and adversely affected by Respondent's' approval of the Project. Moreover,
2 Petitioner's members participated in the public review and comment process for the Project.

3 5. Respondent, Los Angeles Unified School District, is a school district created

4 under the laws of the State of California. The District is the lead agency under the California
5 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA").

6. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Real Parties sued herein

7 as ROES 1-25, inclusive, and therefore sues these Real Parties by such fictitious names.

8 Petitioner will amend this Petition to allege the true names and capacities of fictitiously named

9 Real Parties in Interest. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that each
10 Respondent designated herein as a ROE has some responsibility for the events and happenings

11 alleged in this Petition. 00€ e}ns JURISDICTION AND VENUE d'11'dnoug MET jeuueus LLZ06 12

13 7. This Court has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1094.5 of the Code 'SIl!H MVPNE MBHALSIAA OOZO Beverly 14 of Civil Procedure, and sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.
15 8. This Court also has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1085 of the

16 Code of Civil Procedure.

17 9. Venue for this action properly lies in the Los Angeles Superior Court because

18 Respondent and the Project are located in Los Angeles County.

PROJECT 19

20 10. According to the District, "The project consists of the comprehensive
21 modernization of the Roosevelt High School campus with new classrooms, a gym, a lunch
shelter, and an auditorium. Other improvements include campus-wide infrastructure, including
23 domestic water, fire, irrigation, gas, sewer, low voltage (fire, telephone, data), electrical and 22

24 storm drainage, ADA compliance, landscape, hardscape, and exterior paint. Prior to construction
25 of the new facilities, the District proposes to remove approximately 7,000 cubic yards of soil

26 with elevated concentrations of arsenic and/or lead from the campus and dispose of it off-site in
27

3 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 accordance with the conditions that are presented in the Removal Action Workplan." Notably,
2 the Project contemplates the complete demolition of the historic "R" building.
3 PROJECT BACKGROUND, ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND APPROVAL

11. The Notice of Preparation ("NOP") for the Project was issued on or about
5 October 18, 2017. The Draft EIR was released on February 6, 2018. The District received 4

6 numerous written comments on the Draft EIR during this review period.

12. Respondent did not recirculate revised Draft EIR. Instead, Respondent prepared
8 responses to comments and published a Final EIR.
9 13. On March 8. 2018 the Los Angeles Unified School District's Board of Education
10 held a hearing regarding the Project. Despite testimony in strong opposition to the Project,
11 especially the demolition of the "R" building, the Board certified the EIR and approved the § d11'dnoJg MET |auueu: - 1706 E 08 *PNIE AH B I A  Z8 'SIIIH Áuereg 12 Project.
13 14. On or about May 9, 2018, the District filed a Notice of Determination ("NOD")
14 with the State Clearinghouse. The District and Petitioner entered into tolling agreements to
15 extend the applicable statute of limitations to July 2, 2018.

16 CEQA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REOUIREMENTS

17 15. In 1970, the California Legislature enacted CEQA, as a means of forcing public
18 agency decision makers, such as Respondent, to document and consider the environmental
19 implications of its actions. CEQA's fundamental goal is to fully inform the public and the
20 decision makers as to the environmental consequences of proposed projects and to assure
21 members of the public that their elected officials are making informed decisions. CEQA requires
22 governmental authorities, such as Respondent, to fully evaluate potential environmental effects
23 of projects, and to seek feasible means to reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that
24 otherwise could result from their actions, CEQA limits agencies from approving projects with
25 significant adverse impacts when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen such impacts.
26 16. The primary function of an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") is to discuss the
27

4 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 important environmental consequences of the project, including cumulative effects, and to
2 provide the agency and the general public with mitigation measures and alternatives to the
3 project that would have Jess serious environmental consequences. Under CEQA lead agencies,
4 such as Respondent, are required to prepare a complete and legally adequate EIR prior to

5 approving any discretionary project that may have a significant adverse a effect on the

6 environment. The EIR must fully disclose and adequately analyze the project's potentially
7 significant environmental effects. CEQA also requires lead agencies, such as Respondent, to

8 consider mitigation measures and alternatives to a project, adopt all feasible mitigation measures
9 and/or alternatives, determine whether proposed mitigation measures will be effective in
10 avoiding or substantially lessening the project's significant environmental impacts, and to make
L1Z06 D0E  S P E  I A OZ 8 SIl!H AJeAég 11 adequate findings, including an adequate statement of overriding consideration for those d17 'dnoJs MEl |euueyo 12 significant environmental impacts deemed unavoidable.
13

14 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (VIOLATION OF CEQA: EIR Does Not Comply with CEQA)
16 17. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
17 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
18 18. CEQA requires a lead agency for a project to prepare an EIR that complies with
19 the requirements of the statute. The lead agency must also provide for public review and
20 comment on the project and associated environmental documentation. An EIR must provide
21 sufficient environmental analysis such that decision-makers can intelligently consider
22 environmental consequences when acting on proposed projects.
23 19. Respondents violated CEQA by certifying an EIR for the Project that is
24 inadequate and fails to comply with CEQA. Among other things, Respondent:
25 a. Failed to adequately analyze identified alternatives to the project and to mitigate impacts
26 by selecting a less impactful, feasible alternative to the Project without adopting a valid
27

5 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 statement of overriding considerations;

2

0 b. Failed to adequately analyze the environmental impacts of the Project by screening out
environmental factors related to the following: Aesthetics, Biological Resources, Mineral

Un Resources, Public Services, Utilities/Service Systems, Agricultural Resources,
Hydrology/Water Quality, Recreation, Geology/Soils, Land Use/Planning, and
Population/Housing.

7 20. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion

9 by certifying an EIR that does not comply with CEQA and by approving the Project in reliance

10 thereon. Accordingly, Respondent's certification of the EIR and approval of the Project must be
set aside.

11
d77 § SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

12
MET uuzyC 'dnois LI-Z06 8200 Wilsh FI ISA CA SULZO 13 (VIOLATION OF CEQA: Inadequate Findings)

21.

'SIIH Auereg 14 Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
15 22.

16 CEQA requires that a lead agency's findings for the approval of a project be

17 supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. CEQA further requires that a lead

18 agency provide an explanation of how evidence in the record supports the conclusions it has

reached.

19 23.

20 Respondents violated CEQA by adopting findings that are inadequate as a matter

21 of law in that they are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, including, but not
limited to, the following.
22 a.

23 The adoption of the Statement of Overriding Considerations;

b.

24 The determination that the Project would cause no potentially significant impacts on the

25 following environmental factors: Aesthetics, Biological Resources, Mineral Resources,

26 Public Services, Utilities/Service Systems, Agricultural Resources, Hydrology/Water

27 Quality, Recreation, Geology/Soils, Land Use/Planning, and Population/Housing.

28 6

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

C. The determination that certain impacts would be less than significant and/or that adopted
mitigation measures would avoid or lessen the Project's significant effects on the

environment;

d. The determination that alternatives to the Project and proposed mitigation measures that
would have avoided or lessened the significant impacts of the Project were infeasible;

6 e. The determination that alternatives considered would not meet project objectives.

7 24. a As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their
8 discretion by adopting findings that do not comply with the requirements of CEQA and
9 approving the Project in reliance thereon. Accordingly, Respondents' certification of the EIR and
10 approval of the Project must be set aside.
THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION 11
8 d11 'dnoJo Mel (euueyo L1Z06 LSM P E H S IA A B OZ 8 SIIIH ApeAe 12 (VIOLATION OF CEQA: Inadequate Response to Comments)
13 25. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
14 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
15 26. Respondents failed to respond adequately to comments submitted by Petitioner,
16 other members of the public, and other agencies. Instead, the responses given to numerous
17 comments regarding the Project's impacts were dismissive, conclusory, evasive, confusing, or
18 otherwise non-responsive, contrary to the requirements of CEQA.
19 27. By failing to provide adequate responses to public comments and proposed
20 alternatives, Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law. Moreover,
21 Respondents' finding that adequate responses to comments were provided is not supported by
22 substantial evidence.

FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION 23

24 (VIOLATION OF CEQA: Unsupported Statement of Overriding Considerations)
25 28. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth
26 above.
27

7 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 29. Prior to approving project for which an EIR has been certified, CEQA requires
2 the lead agency to adopt one of three possible findings concerning each significant impact
3 identified in the EIR ("CEQA Findings"). The CEQA Findings must be supported by substantial

4 evidence in the administrative record of proceedings.

5 30. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by failing to proceed in the

6 manner required by law by adopting CEQA Findings that are not supported by substantial

7 evidence. For example, Respondents failed to provide substantial evidence of the Project's

8 I purported multi-modal transit impacts, thereby precluding accurate conclusions concerning the

9 minimization of such impacts.

31. Where a significant impact cannot be mitigated to a less-than-significant level, 10

11 CEQA allows a lead agency to adopt what is known as a "statement of overriding
8 d'11'dnoJg Channel Law Il considerations." (Public Resources Code § 21081, subd. (b).)
LLZ06 'SI!H 1 0 VP ET M I A D OZ B Beverly 12
32. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by failing to proceed in the
13 manner required by law by adopting a Statement of Overriding Considerations that is not
14 supported by substantial evidence. Respondents have downplayed the Project's impacts and have
15 overstated its anticipated benefits.
16 33. Accordingly, the Project Approvals must be set aside and declared void.
17 Respondents must be prohibited from taking any further actions with respect to the Project until
18 they have complied with the applicable legal requirements.
FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION 19

20 (DECLARATORY RELIEF)
21 34. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
22 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
23 35. Petitioner seeks a judicial declaration that Respondents' adoption of a Mitigated
24 Negative Declaration for the Project failed to comply with the requirements of CEQA.
25 36. Respondents have a mandatory duty to comply with CEQA and other legal
26 requirements applicable to the Project.
27

8 28

VERIFIED PETITIC R WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

37. Petitioner has the right to enforce these mandatory duties.

2 38. Petitioner has no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy at law, and will suffer
3  irreparable injury unless it receives the relief requested in this Petition.
4 39. An actual controversy exists between Petitioner and Respondents as to whether
5 the actions and conduct of Respondents alleged in this Petition have violated CEQA and other
6 laws as identified herein. This controversy implicates the legality of the manner in which
7 Respondents have proceeded in giving the Project Approvals, the validity of the Respondents'
8 actions with respect thereto and, consequently, the legal ability of Respondents to take further
9  actions to develop the Project based upon the Project Approvals. The Petitioner contends that
10 each and all such actions and conduct have violated and will violate these laws. Petitioner is

11
LIZ06 D0 VPE  SI A D OZ B SIl!H Auereg informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that Respondents dispute these contentions. A
12 judicial resolution of that controversy is now required pursuant to California Code of Civil d17 dnoJo Me7 jeuueyo 13 Procedure section 1060.

14 40. Petitioner requests a judicial declaration that Respondents' actions and conduct
15 alleged in this Petition have violated and will violate CEQA and other laws identified herein.
16 Such declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time under the circumstances in order that
17 Petitioner and Respondents may ascertain their rights and duties.
18 41. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.
19 No money damages or other legal remedy could adequately compensate Petitioner for the harms
20 described in the preceding paragraphs.
21 NOTICE OF COMMENCEMENT OF CEQA PROCEEDING
22 42. On June 21, 2018, prior to filing this Petition, Petitioner, through its counsel,
23 served the District with notice of Petitioner's intention to immediately commence a proceeding
24 against Respondents for violation of CEQA in connection with the Project. A copy of the letter
25 providing such notice is attached to this Petition as Exhibit A and is incorporated herein by this
26 reference. This letter satisfied Petitioner's duties under Public Resources Code section 21167.5.

2 General with notice of the commencement of this lawsuit, together with a true a and correct copy

3 of this Petition. A copy of such notice (without the copy of this Petition attached to such notice),
4 together with proof of service, is attached to this Petition as Exhibit B and is incorporated herein

5 by this reference. Such notice satisfies Petitioner's duties under Public Resources Code section
6 21167.7 and California Code of Civil Procedure, section 388.

7 PREPARATION OF THE RECORD
