Friends of The Short Cut alleges:

2 This Petition challenges the actions of Respondent CITY OF OAKLAND ("CITY") in carrying out
3 a project identified as "Repairs to City stair path #137 called the 'Short Cut' Alvarado Road descending to

4 the Claremont Hotel parking lot" (Project). Plaintiff FRIENDS OF THE SHORT CUT alleges that the
5 | City's actions violate applicable provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public

6 Resources Code §§ 21000 et seq. The City improperly relied on categorical and statutory exemptions from

7 CEQA even though it is clear that the Project as now planned would result in unmitigated significant impacts

8 to an historic resource.
2. Friends of The Short Cut seeks a writ of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085 and/or

10 1094.5 prohibiting the City from implementing the Project without adequate CEQA review. Friends of The
Short Cut also seeks a stay of decision during the pendency of these proceedings suspending the City's 11 authority to take any further actions regarding the Project and a interim and permanent injunctive relief
12 enjoining action by the City that could result in changes to the physical environment unless and until the City
13 complies with CEQA. Friends of The Short Cut seeks an award of costs and attorney's fees under Code of
14 Civil Procedure § 1021.5, together with any other relief the Court deems necessary and proper.
15 Parties

16 3. Petitioner FRIENDS OF THE SHORT CUT is an unincorporated association with its principal place
17 of business is Oakland, California. Friends of The Short Cut's organizational purpose is to preserve and
18 protect the historic and cultural value of The Short Cut while ensuring a repair project that would permit safe

19 use of the facility. Friends of The Short Cut's members include residents, taxpayers, and electors who reside

20 in the City of Oakland and Alameda County and who currently enjoy the cultural and historic values,

21 ambiance, views, historic plantings, and mobility provided by The Short Cut and which are threatened if the

22 City implements the currently proposed Project without environmental review and mitigation. Friends of

23 The Short Cut's members have a clear and present right to, and beneficial interest in, the City's performance

24 of its duties to comply with CEQA. As citizens, homeowners, taxpayers, and electors, Friends of The Short

25 Cut's members are within the class of persons to whom the City owes such duties. Friends of The Short
Cut's members will also suffer direct injury as a result of the adverse environmental, aesthetic, and land use 26 impacts caused by the Project. These include loss of cultural and historic values, ambiance, views, historic
27 plantings, and mobility provided by The Short Cut.

Petition for Writ of Mandate; (CEQA) Case No.

By this action, Friends of The Short Cut seeks to protect the interests of its members and to enforce
2 a public duty owed to them by the City.
3 5. Members of Friends of The Short Cut have objected to the City's proposed Project in emails and

4 appearances at public meetings in July and August 2018 when the members became aware that the City had
s changed the scope of the Project identified in the 2014 Notice of Exemption.

6 6. Respondent City of Oakland is municipality of the State of California. Respondent Oakland City

7 Council is the governing legislative body of the City. The City and its City Council (collectively the "City")

8 are the governing land use authorities for the Project challenged in this action and the lead agency for

9 purpose of complying with CEQA.
7.
10 On May 20, 2014, the City Council adopted Resolution No. 84988 authorizing the City

11 Administrator to request an allocation of State Transportation Development Act Article 3 funds for the
Project, finding that the Project as then described was exempt from CEQA. The City has acted as the lead
12 agency responsible under CEQA for evaluating the environmental impacts of the Project.
13 8. Does 1 to 25 are fictitiously named respondents whose true names and capacities are currently
14 unknown to Plaintiffs. If and when their true names and capacities are known, this petition will be amended
15 to assert them.
16 Background Facts
17 9. The Short Cut is a 16' wide and roughly 300' long footpath leading down the steep hill between
18 Lower Alvarado Road to the Hotel Claremont's south parking area near Tunnel Road in the City of Oakland.
19 The Short Cut features stone steps and retaining walls which appear to have been quarried and constructed

20 at the same time as the Hotel Claremont (1906-1914). The designed curvilinear entry off of Alvarado Road

21 to the first descending steps and these steps are composed of stonework and feature a rustic bench resting

22 on three stones. The Short Cut is lined with Royal Palms planted by the hotel circa 1915, as well as other

23 mature trees.

10.
24 The Short Cut contains three segments. The western segment consists of concrete steps rising from

25 Tunnel Road, some of which are broken and tilted. The central segment consists of a long sloping asphalt
pathway. The eastern segment consists of stonework steps rising to the curvilinear landing off of Alvarado 26 Road.
27 l1. The Claremont Hotel, adjacent to The Short Cut, was found eligible for the National Register of
28 Historic Places (NRHP) and is listed on the California Register of Historical Resources (CRHR) in 2003.

Petition for Writ of Mandate; (CEQA) Case No.

I The nomination for historical resource eligibility included both the Hotel and its adjacent grounds and
2 gardens.
3 12. The Short Cut was constructed contemporaneously with the Claremont Hotel and uses stone
4 materials and workmanship consistent with the Claremont Hotel. The Short Cut, with its bordering palm

5 trees, is connected thematically and visually to the rest of the Hotel Claremont grounds, where palms were

6 featured prominently.

7 13. The Short Cut meets the criteria for a historic resource under CEQA because it is associated with

8 events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of California's history and cultural
heritage.
9 14.
10 The Short Cut also meets the criteria for a historic resource under CEQA because it embodies the
distinctive characteristics of a type, period, region, or method of construction, or represents the work of an 11 important creative individual, or possesses high artistic values.
12 15. Construction of the Project, as now planned, would constitute a significant adverse impact to
13 resource that meets CEQA's criteria for a historic resource by materially altering the character-defining
14 features which allow it to retain integrity.
15 Procedural History
16 16. On April 2, 2014, a staff report to the City Council recommended that the City apply for a grant from
17 the State Transportation Development Act Article 3 funds for The Short Cut Project. The staff report
18 described the project as follows: "The Rehabilitation of the Short Cut Stair Path at Alvarado Road will
19 correct trip-and-fall issues by replacing concrete steps and landings, and installing handrails. The stair path

20 is adjacent to the renovated Eucalyptus Stair and connects Alvarado Road to Tunnel Road, serving a

21 commercial district, transit, and an elementary school. Identified as stair path #137, the rehabilitation of the

22 Short Cut is a priority based on a citywide inventory and ranking of the City's stairs and paths."

23 17. The staff report does not indicate that The Short Cut Project would include any changes to the middle

24 section of The Short Cut, consisting of a sloping asphalt path, or that the Project would make any changes

25 to the rock stairs at the east end of The Short Cut. The staff report does not indicate that The Short Cut
Project would include any changes to accommodate bicycle use such as a bicycle channel or runnel. 26 18.
27 On May 20, 2014, the City Council adopted Resolution No. 84988 authorizing the City
Administrator to request an allocation of State Transportation Development Act Article 3 funds for the
28 "Rehabilitation of the Short Cut Stair Path at Alvarado Road" project.

Petition for Writ of Mandate; (CEQA) Case No.

1 19. On May 23, 2014 the City filed a Notice of Exemption (NOE) under CEQA for The Short Cut
2 Project identified as "Repairs to City stair path #137 called the 'Short Cut' Alvarado Road descending to
3 the Claremont Hotel parking lot" (emphasis added).

4 20. The NOE project description states "[g]enerally, repairs include the replacement of broken, tilted
5 concrete at walkways or steps, the addition of code complaint handrails at steps and sloping walkways, and

6 street signs" (emphasis added).

7 21. The NOE project description did not identify any changes to the rock stairs, any changes to the

8 sloping asphalt path comprising the middle section of The Short Cut, or any provision of bicycle facilities.
22. The NOE states that The Short Cut Project is exempt from CEQA under the "General Rule {Sec

10 15061(b)(3)}," and under categorical exemptions for "Existing Facilities (Sec 15301(c) (f)) and Minor
Alterations (Sec 15304 (h))."
11 23. In April 2016, Project neighbors became aware of a March 15, 2016, e-mail from Jeff Krohn,
12 identified as the Project architect for the City (then with the City's Bureau of Engineering and Construction,
13 now with the City's Department of Transportation), that indicated that the scope of the Project might include
14 replacement of the sloping middle section of The Short Cut with stairs and landings and replacement of the
15 rock steps with concrete steps.
16 24. On April 29, 2016, a Project neighbor, David Kessler, emailed Jeff Krohn, the architect for the City
17 (then with the Bureau of Engineering and Construction, now with the Department of Transportation).
18 Kessler explained that the neighbors were concerned about the potential loss of features of distinctive
19 character and historical significance and the potential impacts on users with wheeled vehicles. Kessler
20 requested drawings of The Short Cut Project and asked the City to convene a public meeting to discuss the

21 work before it commences.

22 25. In response, on April 29, 2016, City architect Krohn advised neighbor Kessler by email that the City

23 had not surveyed the site and no design work had begun. Krohn told Kessler that "when the design is at

24 65%, citizens using or bordering the stair path shall participate in a review." Krohn explained that such

25 public meeting would usually be coordinated by the council district member, Mr. Dan Kalb, but that Krohn
had not contacted him yet because "all is premature."
26 26. On June 1, 2016, neighbor Rani Marx asked City architect Krohn for information on the stair Project. 27 Krohn responded on June 2, 2016, that the Project was still under design so no drawings were ready yet for
28 public comment.

Petition for Writ of Mandate; (CEQA) Case No.

1 27. On June 15, 2017, neighbor Justin Baldwin requested that City architect Krohn advise him of the
2 status of the Project and expressed concern that the Project might affect the historical protection of the
3 property. Krohn did not respond to that request for more than a year.
4 28. Despite its commitment for public review of the Project design before it was finalized, the City did
5 not schedule a design meeting with the neighbors or advise them of the Project plans before July 2018.

6 29. Friends of The Short Cut are informed and believe that the City entered into a contract with Bay

7 Construction Company to construct the Project prior to July 2018 without a noticed public hearing on the

8 contract.

30. On July 6, 2018, Bay Construction Company notified Project neighbors via door hangers that it had

10 contracted with the City for "replacement of the pedestrian stair path" and that it would begin construction

11 on July 16, 2018. The door hanger advised neighbors with questions or concerns to contact Jeffrey S.
Krohn, identified as City of Oakland Resident Engineer.
12 31. On July 9, 2018, neighbor Marx addressed the meeting of the Oakland Landmarks Preservation
13 Advisory Board during its Open Forum to object that the City had not honored its commitment to provide
14 plans or to permit public participation in Project design. 15 32. On July 10, 2018, neighbor Marx learned from City architect/engineer Krohn that the City had
16 decided not to hold a public meeting or to consider public comments on the Project design because the City
17 believed it to be a small job that could not be adjusted by the public . Krohn represented that the City had
18 "melded the historical and required access goals attractively."
19 33. On July 11, 2018, Tom Debley, president of Oakland Heritage Alliance, wrote to City
20 architect/engineer Krohn and members of the City's Planning and Zoning Bureau, Public Works

21 Department, and Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board to explain that The Short Cut could be a cultural

22 resource and subject to designation as a Heritage Property. Debley pointed out the City's obligation under

23 its General Plan Historic Preservation Element to preserve historic resources and to conduct CEQA review

24 of projects that affect historic resources. Debley urged postponement of the Project construction to allow

25 consideration of alternatives that would preserve the historic character of The Short Cut, CEQA review of

26 the historic resource, and a hearing to consider landmark designation.
34.
27 On July 11, 2018, neighbor Kessler emailed City architect/engineer Krohn to request that a public
meeting be held before Project plans were finalized.

1 35. On July 13, 2018, City architect/engineer Krohn advised neighbors that the City would hold a public
2 meeting on July 17, 2018. Krohn provided a Dropbox link to the Project drawings, which are identified as
3 the "100% bid set 12-16-16."

4 36. On July 13, 2018, neighbor Marx emailed City staff to request postponement of the Project until the
5 City considers historic preservation requirements and the public has the opportunity to comment on the

6 plans.

7 37. On July 17, 2018, counsel for the Claremont Preservation Coalition notified the City that the Project

8 may have a significant effect on the historic character and aesthetics of The Short Cut and objected to

9 implementation of the plan without CEQA review.
38.
10 On July 17, 2018, the City held a public meeting to discuss the Project with neighbors.
39.
11 As a result of the July 17, 2018, meeting and review of the Project plans provided by City
architect/engineer Krohn on July 13, 2018, neighbors learned that the contract already awarded for The Short
12 Cut Project goes well beyond the proposed "replacement of broken, tilted concrete at walkways or steps, the
13 addition of code complaint handrails at steps and sloping walkways, and street signs" described in the 2014
14 Notice of Exemption. For example, the Project would alter the existing stone stairs by covering them with
15 concrete. The Project would entirely rebuild the sloping asphalt path that comprises the middle section of
16 The Short Cut with a series of concrete stairs and landings. The Project would add a bicycle runnel to all
17 of the new concrete stairs. The Project would narrow portions of The Short Cut to 44 inches. None of these
18 changes were identified in the 2014 Notice of Exemption.

19 40. On July 30, 2018, neighbor Baldwin objected to City architect/engineer Krohn that Krohn had not
20 responded to Baldwin's June 15, 2017, request for project status. Baldwin expressed concern about the
21 Project impact on an historic resource and the need for a public review. On July 30, 2018, City

22 architect/engineer Krohn responded to Baldwin that, although he had previously told the public that there

23 would be a review, "my administration at the time considered it a right of way repair, and thus a minor code

24 required upgrade which did not involve the public." Krohn stated that the City staff had "retained the

25 historical elements of the path in the final design, which we felt accommodated both its history and provided
for new accessibility to more path users."
26 41.
27 In July and August, 2018, hundreds of neighbors petitioned the City to designate The Short Cut as
a Heritage Property and to postpone Project construction until alternatives are considered.

Petition for Writ of Mandate; (CEQA) Case No.

1 42. On August 3, 2018, neighbor Justin Baldwin submitted a Notice of Intent to Submit Oakland
2 Landmark and S-7 Preservation Combining Zone Application to the Oakland Landmarks Preservation
3 Advisory Board. Baldwin requested that the application to designate The Short Cut as a Heritage Property
4 be considered on an expedited basis in view of the City's plan to commence construction. Baldwin objected

5 to any plan to replace the stone steps with concrete or to replace the asphalt path with concrete steps and

6 ramps, destroying the cultural significance of The Short Cut and potentially damaging the bordering trees.

7 43. On August 5, 2018, neighbor Marx objected to City architect/engineer Krohn that the July 17, 2018,

8 meeting had not provided the opportunity for community participation in design that Krohn had promised
in 2016. Krohn acknowledged that "senior management felt the project too small in scope to warrant a 9

10 community meeting."
44.
11 On August 9, 2018, City architect/engineer Krohn advised the neighbors that the City had made some
changes to the original Project design to accommodate community input, including preserving stone walls
12 on either side of the stairs, changing the color of the handrails and cement, and adding a bicycle channel.
13 Krohn advised the neighbors that the City would host a public meeting on August 16, 2018, to discuss design
14 changes.
15 45. On August 10, 2018, neighbor Marx advised City architect/engineer Krohn that the City had not
16 provided sufficient lead time to permit public participation and requested a second meeting in September.
17 Marx identified the neighbors' priorities as making the path safe while preserving its historic character and
18 appearance. Marx explained that this would entail rebuilding the stone steps rather than covering them with
19 concrete and repaving the sloped asphalt middle section rather than replacing it with flights of stairs and
20 landings with a bicycle runnel.

21 46. On August 13, 2018, the City's Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board agenda included an update

22 of the "DOT project to upgrade the 'cut through ." The agenda did not contain an action item to consider

23 the application to designate The Short Cut as Heritage Property.
47.
24 Friends of The Short Cut is informed and believes that at the August 13, 2018, Landmarks

25 Preservation Advisory Board meeting City Department of Transportation staff indicated that the proposed
Project would cover the stone stairs with concrete and presented handouts that simulated the stairs before 26 and after the treatment.

4|49. On August 16, 2018, the City held a public meeting attended by neighbors to discuss the Project.

5 50. At the August 16, 2018, meeting, Friends of The Shortcut submitted a letter objecting to the Project

52.
10 Friends of The Short Cut is informed and believes that at the August 16, 2018, meeting City staff

11 53. On August 28, 2018, Friends of The Short Cut wrote to City staff to object to the commencement
12 of construction on the basis of the Project plans that had been disclosed to the public in July and August,
13 2018. In its August 28, 2018, letter, Friends of The Short Cut explained that the Project as now planned to
14 be constructed differs materially from the Project as described in the 2014 Notice of Exemption.
15 54. In its August 28, 2018, letter, Friends of The Short Cut provided an expert opinion from Kara
16 Brunzell that The Short Cut is an historic resource. Brunzell explained that construction of the Project as
17 now planned would result in a significant impact to that historic resource.
18 55. In.its August 28, 2018, letter, Friends of The Short Cut offered to meet with City staff to discuss and
19 to attempt to resolve its concerns. Friends of The Short Cut requested that the City agree to postpone

20 Il commencement of construction until the City undertakes a valid CEQA review of the Project as now

21 planned.

22 56. On August 29, 2018, counsel for Friends of The Short Cut notified the City of its intent to commence

23 an action under CEQA alleging that the City violated CEQA by approving ? contract for the Project as now

24 planned. Friends of The Short Cut notified the City that it would seek temporary relief to prohibit the City

25 from implementing the Project as now planned unless and until the City complies with CEQA.
57.
26 On August 29, 2018, the City and Friends of The Short Cut agreed that the City would postpone the
start of the Project to September 18, 2018, in consideration of Friends of The Short Cut not seeking a
27 temporary restraining order on September 4, 2018.

11 and Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 and 1094.5. Venue is proper in the County of Alameda under
Code of Civil Procedure sections 393 and 395.
12 Statute of Limitations
13 60. Because the Project as now planned differs substantially from the Project as described in the 2014
14 Notice of Exemption, the 2014 Notice of Exemption did not commence a period of limitations in which to 15 bring this action. (Concerned Citizens of Costa Mesa, Inc. v. 32nd Dist. Agricultural Assn. (1986) 42 Cal.3d
16 929, 937-939; International Longshoremen's & Warehousemen's Union v. Board of Supervisors (1981) 116
17 Cal.App.3d 265, 273; City of Chula Vista v. County of San Diego (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1713, 1719-1720.)
18 Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies
19 61. This action is brought consistent with the requirements of Public Resources Code § 21177 and Code

20 of Civil Procedure §§ 1085 and/or 1094.5. Friends of The Short Cut objected to the City's construction of
21 the Project orally and in writing after learning that the Project as now approved differs materially from the

22 Project as described in the 2014 Notice of Exemption. Friends of The Short Cut and/or other agencies, |

23 organizations, and/or individuals raised the legal deficiencies asserted in this petition orally or in writing |

24 after learning that the Project as now approved differs materially from the Project as described in the 2014

25 Notice of Exemption. Friends of The Short Cut and its counsel repeatedly asked for relief including a

26 commitment not to construct the Project until completing adequate CEQA review.
62.
27 Friends of The Short Cut has performed all conditions precedent to filing this action by complying
with the requirements of Public Resources Code § 21167.5. Pursuant to Public Resources Code § 21167.5,

Petition for W rit of Mandate; (CEQA) Case No.

1 on August 29, 2018, Plaintiff served Respondent City with written notice of their intent to commence this
2 action. A copy of this notice and proof of service of this notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.
3 63. Pursuant to Public Resources Code § 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388, Plaintiffl

4 served notice of the filing of this action and a copy of this pleading to the Attorney General's office. A copy
of said notice and a copy of the proof of service of the notice and pleading is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.
Private Attorney General Doctrine

7 64. Plaintiff brings this action as a private attorney general pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section

8 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important rights affecting the public interest.

9 Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a significant benefit on a large class of persons

10 by ensuring that Respondent City does not approve the Project in the absence of lawful environmental
review.
11 65. Friends of The Short Cut is entitled to recover attorneys' fees as provided in Code of Civil Procedure
12 § 1021.5 if it prevails in this action and the Court finds that a significant benefit has been conferred on the
13 general public or a large class of persons, and that the necessity and burden of private enforcement is such
14 as to make an award of fees appropriate. Friends of The Short Cut and its members have no substantial
15 financial interest in the subject matter of this action and Friends of The Short Cut brings this action in the
16 public interest.
17 Necessity for Interim Injunctive Relief
18 66. If the Project is allowed to proceed prior to the Court's final judgment on the merits, Friends of The
19 Short Cut and the environment will be greatly, permanently and irreparably injured from the resulting
20 unmitigated environmental, aesthetic, recreational, and land use impacts.

21 67. Under Code of Civil Procedure § 1094.5(g), this Court may issue a stay order during the pendency

22 of the proceedings unless it is satisfied that a stay would be against the public interest. Imposition of a stay

23 would not be against the public interest in that the public will derive no benefit from the Project prior to the

24 Court's final judgment.
68.
25 Under Code of Civil Procedure sections 526 and 527 this Court may issue a restraining order or

26 preliminary injunction during the pendency of the proceedings. Interim injunctive relief is warranted

27 because Friends of The Short Cut is likely to prevail on the merits and because commencement of physical
development activities will cause great and irreparable injury.

Petition for Writ of Mandate; (CEQA) Case No.

l First Cause of Action

2 (Violations of CEQA)

3 69. Plaintiff incorporates all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.
70.
4 At all times relevant to this action the City was the lead agency responsible for the review and

5 approval of the Project under Public Resources Code $ 21067.
71.
6 An activity is a "project" subject to CEQA a if it is a discretionary activity undertaken by a public
agency that may cause a direct or reasonably foreseeable indirect physical effect on the environment. PRC,
7 § 21080, CEQA Guidelines, § 15378.)
8 72. An agency may not rely on the "common sense exemption" for a project unless it can be seen with
9 certainty that there is no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant effect on the
10 environment. (14 C.C.R. § 15061(b)(3).) The Brunzell letter conclusively establishes that the Project may
11 have a significant effect on the environment. Therefore, the City's decision to exempt the Project from
12 CEQA review based on the "common sense exemption" represents a prejudicial abuse of discretion.
13 73. CEQA provides that "a categorical exemption shall not be used for project which may cause a

14 substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource." 14 C.C.R. § 15300.2(k). The

15 Brunzell letter conclusively establishes that The Short Cut is a historical resource and that the Project may

16 cause a substantial adverse change in its significance. Therefore, the City's decision to exempt the Project

17 from CEQA review based on the Class 1 and 4 categorical exemption represents a prejudicial abuse a of

18 discretion.

74.
19 The City prejudicially abused its discretion by failing to proceed as required by CEQA because it

20 relied on mitigation or a project alternative a in order to justify its continued treatment of the Project as

21 exempt. (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network v. County of Marin (2004) 125 CalApp.4th 1098, 1102;
Azusa Land Reclamation Co. v. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997) 52 CalApp.4th 1165, 1200.)
22 75. Plaintiff has no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law and will suffer
23 irreparable injury unless this Court issues the writ of mandate prayed for below.
24 Prayer for Relief
25 WHEREFORE, Friends of The Short Cut prays for entry of judgment as follows:
26 76. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing the City:
27 a. to set aside its May 23, 2014, Notice of Exemption finding that the Project is exempt from
28 CEQA;

2 findings that it is exempt from CEQA;

3 C. to comply with CEQA in any subsequent action or actions taken to approve the Project;

4 77. For other relief that prevents the City's actions, determinations, and approvals for the Project from

5 taking effect and/or that requires the City to rescind, modify, or invalidate its actions related to the Project;

6 78. For an order granting temporary relief, including an order prohibiting the City and its agents from

7 proceeding with the Project pending the outcome of this proceeding;

8 79. For a preliminary and permanent injunction directing the City to cease and refrain from engaging in
any action related to the Project that could result in any change or alteration in the physical environment until

10 the City takes any necessary action to bring its action into compliance with CEQA.
80. For its costs of suit;
11 81. For an award of attorneys' fees, including attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 12 1021.5 and/or the catalyst theory; and
13 82. For other legal or equitable relief that the Court deems just and proper.
