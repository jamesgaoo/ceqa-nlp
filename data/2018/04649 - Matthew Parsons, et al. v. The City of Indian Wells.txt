22 Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief against the City

24 INTRODUCTION

25 1. This Petition seeks relief from the City of Indian Welis' rushed and punitive adoption of
26 Ordinance No. 710, (the "Ordinance") which severely and illegally bans short-term rentals
•27 ("STRs")-i.e., rentals of less than 29 days-of oniy certain residential properties within the

LEWIS BRISBOIS 28 City. Petitioners bring this action, among other reasons, because the City in its haste to appease a

BISGAARD & SMITTHLIP ATORMENS ATLAW -A VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECALARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 noisy minority of its residents did not comply with the requirements of the California
2 Environmental Quality Act, codified at Public Resources Code sections 21000-21189.3
3 ("CEQA"), by failing to conduct any environmental analysis, despite receiving evidence of

4 significant environmental impacts prior to adoption of the Ordinance from City staff, the

5 Petitioners, and other members of the public.
2. At the public hearings on the Ordinance, the City was presented with evidence in the form
of prior statements from the City's own Community Development Director in charge of STR,
8 testimony, news articles, and copies of studies showing that an overly restrictive ordinance, like
9 Ordinance No. 710, that broadly bans STRs (i.e., rentals of less than 29 days) would drive the
10 rental of STRs underground. As a result, the City's code enforcement would become more

11 difficult and would increase impacts to noise, light, pollution and other conditions that the City
12 intended to combat with the Ordinance. Evidence provided to the City showed there was only one
13 noise complaint from a STR in all of 2017, despite robust enforcement by the City. The existing
14 regulations were working well, but perhaps to appease a new hotel development approved on the
15 very same day that includes competitive STRs, the City ignored this information in the record.

16 3. Instead of taking the time to address this evidence of potentially significant environmental
17 impacts by studying them as required by CEQA, the City instead relied upon CEQA's
18 extraordinary exemption under 14 Cal Code Regulations 15061(b)(3), which states that this

19 exemption can only be used when "it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility that the
20 | activity in question may have a significant effect on the environment." The use of such an

21 exemption despite evidence in the record from the City's own staff showing a potentially
22 significant increase in impacts is contrary to the purposes and requirements of CEQA.

23 4. Petitioners also file suit to enforce and clarify their vested property rights, and those of
24 others similarly situated, to continue to rent their residence in the City for a minimum seven-day
25 and seven-night booking under their City recognized and approved "grandfathered" permits
26 (rather than the new requirement that all leases be for at least a month), despite the City's new
27 Ordinance.

AITORNEYS AT LAW INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 5. The City, prior to the new Ordinance, had repeatedly and consistently stated in

2 communication to Petitioners and the general public that properties with permits granted before

3 July 4, 2015 would be granted the status of "grandfathered" STRs within the City limits. Indeed,
the City specifically wrote to all City property owners, including Petitioners, in the run-up to a
5 "deadline" to grandfather properties as STRs in 2015, and in this document entitled "Rules
6 Guiding Short Term Rentals and What You Need to Know"' stated:
"Ordinance Bill No. 689 that goes into effect on Saturday, July 4, 2015 and opens
the thirty (30) day grandfathering registration period for any property owner not
currently registered. The Ordinance allows grandfathered vacation rentals to rent

10 for a minimum of seven (7) days and seven (7) nights, year-round. The

11 grandfathering registration period ends Monday, August 3, 2015, close of business

12 at City Hall."

13 6. Petitioners registered their property in accordance with the City's instructions prior to the
14 || June 4, 2015 deadline. In justifiable reliance upon this official communication, as well as a
15 contemporaneously documented phone call with an authorized City representative confirming that
16 Petitioners would be permitted to continue to rent their STR property for a minimum of seven-
17 days and seven-nights under their grandfathered STR permit, the Parsons invested over
18 $1,000,000 into their property on the basis that they would be able to continue renting the property
19 a as a STR under the terms of their vested and grandfathered STR permit.

20 7. Petitioners' vested rights to their STR. permit and their continued ability to rent their
21 property a as a STR are protected under both the California and United States Constitutions, and the

22 City's ill-considered Ordinance 710 violates numerous provisions of each.

23 8. While the City did amend provisions of the Ordinance in partial response to many
24 complaints at the public hearings on it, the Ordinance still provides that only certain property
25 owners who are in newly constructed developments or who live within the City's most exclusive
26 country clubs, or within HOAs that vote to allow short-term rentals contrary to the provisions of
27 the Davis-Sterling Act, Civil Code sections 4000 to 6150 and the Nonprofit Mutual Benefit

LEWIS 28 Corporation Law, and Corporations Code sections 7110 to 8910, arê allowed to keep their
BRISBOIS 4831-7201-5977.2 3

1 grandfathered permits. Those properties outside of the limited groups of new developments or
2 country clubs within the City, or those not in an HOA, or those in which a HOA doesn't act by a
3 statutorily unauthorized vote to allow STRs regardless of the Covenants Codes and Restrictions

4 (CC&Rs) for the Property, will see their vested rights canceled pursuant to the Ordinance on
5 December 31, 2019.

9. For the reasons stated here and as further set forth below, the Ordinance should be set

7 aside, and the City should be permanently enjoined from enforcing the unconstitutional Ordinance

8 provisions.

9 PARTIES

10 10. The Parsons own property located at 76011 Fairway Drive, Indian Wells, CA, 92210 (the
11 "Property). The Parsons own this Property, and have operated it as an STR within the City of
12 Indian Wells since before the present Ordinance was enacted. The City issued the Parsons an STR
13 permit for this property on July 17, 2015.. The Parsons have invested approximately $1.5 million
14 Il to acquire, maintain and improve their STR property. The Parsons' STR permit remains active
15 and has not been revoked by the City.

16 11. Defendant and Respondent, City of Indian Welis, is a municipal corporation organized and

17 existing as a charter city under the laws of the State of California, located in Riverside County.

18 12. The true names or capacities, whether individual, corporate, associate, or otherwise of the

19 Defendants and Respondents named herein as "Doe" are unknown to Petitioners, who therefore

20 sue those Defendants and Respondents by fictitious names. Petitioners will request leave to amend
21 this Petition to show the true names or capacities of these Defendants and Respondents once they

22 have been ascertained.

23 VENUE

24 13. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to California Constitution Art. 6,
25  section 10; sections 1085,1060 and 187 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and sections 21167,
26 21167.5, and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code. This Court also has concurrent jurisdiction
27 over claims brought under 42. U.S.C. section 1983. An action under section 1983 may be heard in

2 Horvath (1976) 16.Cal.3d 834; Kreutzer v. County of San Diego (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 62, 69.

3 14. Venue is proper in Riverside County Superior Court. The Ordinance regulates land use
4 regarding STRs within the City of Indian Wells. The City of Indian Wells is located in Riverside
5 County. Code of Civil Procedure section 394(a).

6 15. Code of Civil Procedure section 1060 allows an ordinance to be challenged in an action for
7 declaratory relief. See Alameda County Land Use Assn. v. City of Hayward (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th

8 1716, 1723. The parties havea a dispute regarding the validity of Ordinance No. 710, and

9 Petitioners are entitled to a judicial declaration setting forth their rights as related to their property.

10 16. Petitioners are notifying the City of the filing of this action by mail service of the Notice of
11 Commencement of Action, pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.5. Petitioners are
12| also filing with this Petition the Request for Preparation of the Record. In that notice, Petitioners
13 are requesting that the City prepare a record of proceedings per Public Resources Code section
14  21167.6(b)(2). Copies of the Notice of Commencement of Action and Request for Preparation of
15 Record of Proceedings are being filed concurrently herewith and served on all parties

16 17. Petitioners request a hearing pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.4. A Copy
17 of the Request for Hearing is filed concurrently herewith and served on all parties.

18 18. Petitioners will serve a copy of this pleading and concurrently filed notices and requests on
19 the California Attorney General within 10 days of the commencement of this action, pursuant to
20 Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388. A copy of the
21 Proof of Service on the Attorney General is filed concurrently herewith.

22 EXHAUSTION OF REMEDIES

23 19. Petitioners have satisfied all requirements to exhaust their remedies necessary to bring this
24| proceeding. Government Code section 65009. Public Resources Code section 21177.

25 20. Petitioners' raised the issues pled in the following causes of action before the Indian Wells
26 City Council at City Council Meetings dated January 23, 2018 and February 15, 2018. Other
27 members of the public also spoke in opposition to the Ordinance.

BRISBOIS 4831-7201-5977.2
BISGAARD
& SMITH UP VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECALARATORY AND

ATTORNEYS AT LAW INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 21. Petitioners' Counsel, John Nelson, drafted letters to the City dated January 23, 2018 and
2 February 14, 2018 that raises these same issues. These letters will be part of the record of
3 proceedings in this action.
22. Alternatively, Petitioners are excused from exhausting available administrative remedies
5 because the City failed to provide notice as required by Government Code 65009 (b)(2). The

6 failure to provide such notice constitutes a waiver of the doctrine of exhaustion of remedies. See

7 Kings County Farm Bureau v. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal. App. 3d 692, 740.

8 23. Any attempt by Petitioners to seek a variance or special exception from the facial terms of
9 the Ordinance would be futile. Under California law, changes of use cannot lawfully be
10 implemented through the variance process. Government Code § 65906. In addition, the ordinances
11 and resolution in this case were adopted despite the City's issuance of contradictory STR permits
12| to Petitioners, in contemplation of Petitioners' current operation of STR properties, and for the
13 express purpose of burdening and eliminating Petitioners' use. In such a situation, further
14 applications or attempts to circumvent the ordinances and resolution through administrative action
15 are not required, as they would be futile. Palazzolo v. Rhode Island (2001) 533 U.S. 606; Hoene v.
16 County of San Benito (9th Cir. 1989) 870 F.2d 529. Petitioners thus have no administrative
17 remedy available to them and have performed all steps required on their part to be performed prior

18 to initiating this action.

19 STANDING AND RIPENESS

20 24. Petitioners bring this action to protect their fundamental vested and constitutional rights as
21 STR permit holders, and to ensure that the City adequately performs its environmental review and
22 analysis obligations in accordance with CEQA. As owners of property within the City, Petitioners
23 have a direct interest in ensuring that the City's land use decisions are informed decisions, based
24 on sufficient environmental review and analysis of potential environmental impacts. Petitioners
25 therefore have standing.

26 25. Petitioners further bring this action to advocate for the continued vitality of STR land uses
27 and operations, to guard against the decay, degradation or displacement of the City's STR uses and

LEWIS 28 neighborhoods, and to ensure that the City engages in responsible, informed and lawful decision-
BRISBOIS 4831-7201-5977.2 6
BISGAARD
& SMITH LIP VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECALARATORY AND

ATTORNEYS AT LAW INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 making. Petitioners' interests including protecting the City from environmental impacts that have
2 not been analyzed and mitigated in accordance with CEQA. As owners of a STR in the City,
3 Petitioners have a direct interest in the proper enforcement and execution of laws affecting the

4 quality of life in the City, in the City's duty to prepare an environmental impact report prior to

5 exercising its discretion in a manner that negatively impacts the local environment, and in

6 protecting their community from noise, lighting impacts, minimizing and ameliorating traffic, and

7 ensuring that the City's recent success in reducing impacts from STRs is not reversed by an overly

8 aggressive ban that will drive rentals underground. Petitioners are directly, adversely, and

9 irreparably affected and prejudiced by the Ordinance.

10 26. Petitioners' claims are ripe for adjudication, as Petitioners will suffer immediate and

11 irreparable harm as a result of the City's violations of CEQA, and the United States and California
12 Constitutions. Furthermore, facial challenges to regulations are ripe upon enactment of the
13 regulation. Ventura Mobilehome Communities Owners Ass'n v. City of San Buenaventura (9th Cir.
14 2004) 371 F.3d 1046, 1052. Petitioners bring this action to challenge the validity of Ordinance
15 No. 710, which was enacted by the City of Indian Wells on March 15, 2018.

16 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

17 27. Petitioner refers to and hereby incorporates by reference the allegations contained in
18 paragraphs 1 through 26, above, of this Petition.

19 28. On July 17, 2015, pursuant to the STR regulations at the time, Petitioners obtained a

20 permit from the City to rent the property as a "grandfathered Short Term Rental." In relevant part,
21 the permit states that it grants the Petitioners the right to rent the property as an STR and it does
22 not state either that the permit cannot be renewed or that the permit is subject to an automatic
23 sunset clause. The City of Indian Wells adopted Ordinance No. 689 on June 3, 2015. The
24 ordinance provided for a 30-day registration period to "grandfather in" existing STRs a for a seven-
25 day minimum stay requirement, applicable year round. A copy of Ordinance No. 689 is attached
26 as Exhibit A. The Ordinance provides that STR registered after the 30-day period will by subject
27 to a much longer 29-day minimum stay requirement.

BRISBOIS 4831-7201-5977.2 7
BISGAARD
& SMIH LIP VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECALARATORY AND

ATTORNEYS AT LAW INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 29. On July 4, 2015, the City mailed a notice to its residents titled "Last Chance: Rules
2 Guiding Short-Term Rentals and What You Need to Know" (the "Last Chance Notice"). A copy
3 of the Last Chance Notice is attached as Exhibit B. The Notice reiterates the registration

4 requirements to grandfather existing STRs for the seven-day minimum stay requirement described
5 in Ordinance No. 689. There is no mention of any sunset or ending provision in the notice.
30. On June 5, 2015, the Desert Sun published an article reiterating the minimum stay
language, and registration deadline for a property to be a grandfathered property and that
8 properties within an HOA are not subject to any limitations.. The article is attached as Exhibit C.
31. On July 14, 2015, Petitioner Matthew Parsons spoke with a City staff member named Jill
10 Moon, who is with the City's Code Enforcement Department. Ms. Moon stated that the City
11 would not enforce minimum stay limits for properties within an HOA. A copy of Mr. Parson's

12 handwritten notes documenting this conversation is attached as Exhibit D.

13 32. From July 2015 through July 2017, Petitioners invested approximately $1.5million into
14 their STR property to build and plan their business in reliance on the terms of Petitioner's STR
15 permit from the City, the Last Chance Notice, the Desert Sun article, and Matthew Parson's
16 conversation with City staff.

17 33. However, on October 19, 2017, the City implied that the then proposed Draft Ordinance
18 No. 710 would be revised to address some of the concerns voiced by citizens of Indian Wells, and

19 was scheduled to be discussed at the April 19, 2018 City Council Meeting. Instead, the City
20 Council moved the discussion of the Draft Ordinance to January, rather than April, 2018.

21 34. On January 22, 2018, at 9:00 a.m., the City's website regarding Council Meeting Agendas
22 incorrectly stated that the discussion about Draft Ordinance No. 710 was "tentative." This error
23 made it difficult for interested parties to participate in the discussion.

24 35. Ordinance No. 710 was introduced in the City Council On February 15, 2018. At the
25 hearing, several citizens voiced concern about the excessive restrictions on STRs.

26 36. Ordinance No. 710 was adopted after a second reading on March 15, 2018.

27 37. The Parsons do not live in a new housing development or within one of the City's

LEWIS 28 exclusive country clubs, and the limited purpose HOA in which their property has been located
BRISBOIS 4831-7201-59772 8
BISGAARD
& SMITH LLP VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECALARATORY AND

ATTORNEYS AT LAW INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

has not voted to allow STR rentals. Moreover, Petitioners' CC&Rs provide generally for the
2 rental of property. A true copy of the CC&Rs is attached as Exhibit E. Furthermore, the
3 Ordinance provides an express sunset provision that allows for "grandfathered" permits such as
4 the Parsons' permit to only remain valid until December 31, 2019, which is rapidly approaching,

5 SO any right Petitioners have to use their property as a STR will expire at the end a of 2019.

0 38. At the February 15, 2018 hearing, City Councilman Ty Peabody asked one of the Parsons'
7 neighbors for that neighbor's address, presumably so he, Mr. Peabody, could pinpoint the address
8 of supporters of short term rentals in the City, for what exact purposes Petitioners do not know,
9 Since that meeting, however, the Parsons have been subjected to harassment by Mr. Peabody who
10 Petitioners are informed and believe has encouraged neighbors to file complaints against the
11 Parsons. Shortly after approval of the Ordinance that Mr. Parsons spoke against, the Parsons
12 received two violations of the City's STR ordinance based upon a specious argument that Mr.
13 Parsons should be able to control generic language on the websites from VRBO and Homeaway
14 regarding the language of their listing. Mr. Parsons has contested both of these citations. True
15 copies of the citations are attached as Exhibit F. Prior to the time that Mr. Parsons spoke out
16 against the proposed Ordinance, Mr. Parsons had never received a violation from the City for his
17 STR.

18 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

19 Writ of Mandate to Set Aside the Ordinance for failure to Comply with CEQA

20 39. Petitioners incorporate by reference all allegations in paragraphs 1 through 38 above, of
21 this Petition.
22 40. The California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") requires discretionary government
23 actions to be reviewed for potential impacts on the environment. Public Resources Code section
24 21000, et seq. The CEQA Guidelines govern implementation of this review, and are codified in
25 Title 14, Chapter 3, sections 15000, et seq., of the California Code of Regulations. First, the lead
26 agency must conduct a preliminary review to determine whether CEQA applies to the proposed
27 project, or if there is an applicable exemption or exception. Tomlinson v. County of Alameda,
LEWIS
BRISBOIS 28 (2012) 1. Cal.App.4th 281, 286. If CEQA applies, the lead agency must prepare an initial study to 4831-7201-5977.2 9
BISGAARD
& SMITH LLP VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECALARATORY AND

ATTORNEYS AT LAW INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 determine whether it may adopt negative declaration, or if a full environmental impact report is
2 required. Id.

3 41. The City failed to comply with CEQA on multiple grounds.. First, there is no evidence that
4| the City conducted any meaningful preliminary review of the Ordinance before adopting it in

5 March of this year. Instead, the City claims that CEQA does not apply to the Ordinance, because

6 the Ordinance "does not commit the City to any action that may have a significant effect on the
7  environment (Ordinance, Section 2.) However, the City ignored its own staff in drawing this

8 conclusion.
42. Second, City staff provided substantial evidence that the Ordinance would cause
10| environmental impacts relating to noise, lighting, traffic, parking, and other issues stemming from
11 over-regulation of STRs. With this evidence of environmental impacts, the City became obligated
12 to either: (1) identify an applicable CEQA exemption or exception, or (2) analyze potential
13 environmental impacts in a negative declaration or in an environmental impact report. Rominger v.
14. County of Colusa, (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 690, 703. The City has not taken any of these steps.
15 One of the purposes of CEQA is to promote informed governmental decision-making regarding
16 potential environmental impacts of proposed projects. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15002.) Failure
17| to conduct the preliminary analysis undermines CEQA's goals of facilitating informed
18 governmental decision-making, and fails to meet the City's environmental review obligations

19 under the Public Resources Code and the California Code of Regulations. The Ordinance should
20 therefore be set aside until the City complies with CEQA requirements.

21 43. Third, the City's use of CEQA's extraordinary exemption under 14 Cal Code Regulations
22 15061(b)(3), which states that this exemption can only be used when "it can be seen with certainty
23 that there is no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant effect on the
24  environment" was unlawful. The use of such an exemption despite evidence in the record from the
25 City's own staff showing potentially significant increase in impacts is contrary to the purposes
26 and requirements of CEQA.

ATTORNEYS ATLAW INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

2 Writ of Mandate to Set Aside the Ordinance Based on Equitable Estoppel

44. Petitioners incorporate by this reference the allegations in paragraphs 1 though 43 above,
of this Petition.

45. The California Doctrine of Equitable Estoppel prevents injury to an acting party when the

6 acting party was induced to act by a second party. See City of Long Beach v. Mansell, (1970) 3
7 Cal.3d 462.

46. This doctrine is frequently applied in the context of municipal land use decisions in
California. Congregation ETZ Chaim v. City of Los Angeles, (2004) 371 F.2d 1122. For example,
10|| California courts have held that when a property owner incurs significant expenses as a result of a
11 reasonable, good faith reliance on a government act, the principle of estoppel prohibits further
12 government acts to prohibit the land use. Toigo v. Town of Ross (1998) 70 Cal.App.4th 309.
13 47. The City is equitably estopped from enforcing Ordinance No. 710, because it induced it
14 many residents and real estate investors, including the Parsons, to plan their property purchases
15| based on seven-day minimum stay requirements, relying on consistent messages from City
16 | publications, communications from City staff, and newspaper quotations of City staff.
17 48. Critically, on July 4, 2015, the City circulated a the "Last Chance Notice" to residents of
18 Indian Wells. A copy of the Last Chance Notice is attached as Exhibit B. The notice advises local
19 residents of a 30-day registration window to grandfather in existing STRs to the seven-day
20 minimum stay requirement by registering with the City before August 3, 2015.
21 49. A June 5, 2015 Desert Sun article reiterated the minimum stay language, noting in relevant
22 part: "Anyone who wants to grandfather their home in to qualify for the seven-day minimum stay,
23 must register with the city no later than August 3[2015]." The same article quotes David
24 Gassaway, city staff member, as follows: "After that registration period, owners can still get a
25 license, but cannot operate for a period less than 29 days."A copy of the Desert Sun article is
26 attached as Exhibit C.

27 50. On July 14, 2015, Petitioner Matthew Parsons was similarly informed by City code

LEWIS 28 enforcement official Jill Moon that the City would not enforce minimum stay limits for properties
BRISBOIS 4831-7201-59772 11
BISGAARD
& SMITH LIP VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECALARATORY AND

AMORNEYS AI LAW INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 within an HOA. A copy of Mr. Parson's handwritten notes about this conversation is attached as

2 Exhibit D.

51. As a result of these communications, the Parsons invested a significant sum in their

4 properties, totaling approximately $1.5 million, on the assumption that their rights as to the
5 minimum stay were grandfathered in per the "Last Chance Notice," Mr. Parsons' communications

6 with City staff, and consistent reports from a regional newspaper quoting City staff. Together,
7 these sources created a reasonable assumption and belief that the City's subsequent STR
8 regulations would be consistent with this message.

9 52. However, approximately three years later, the City adopted Ordinance No. 710, which
10 restricts all STRs that are not within an HOA or certain of the City's most exclusive country clubs

11 to minimum stay requirements of 29 days, with limited exception. As drafted, the ordinance is
12 overly broad, and represents a significant departure from previous City messages. If enforced,
13 Ordinance No. 710 will significantly devalue the Parsons' property investments within the City,

14 and dramatically decrease the operating revenue from their existing STR.

15 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

16 Writ of Mandate for Deprivation of Fundamental Vested Rights under U.S. and California

17 Constitutions

18 53. Petitioners incorporate by this reference the allegations in paragraphs 1 though 52 above,
19l of this Petition

20 54. Mirroring the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the California
21 Constitution prohibits depriving any person of "life, liberty or property without due process of
22 law." Cal. Const. art. I § 7.

23 55. The California Constitution states that "Private property may be taken or damaged for a
24  public use and only when just compensation ... has first been paid to ... the owner." Cal. Const.
25 art. I § 19. The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution has a similar provision.

26 56. 42 U.S.C. § 1983 states that any person who is deprived of any "rights, privileges, or
27  immunities secured by the Constitution and laws... " by virtue of an ordinance may seek redress

LEWIS 28 for any injuries sustained.

57. Both California and the United States extend these constitutionally protected rights to

2 rights granted by permit in cases where the permit holder performed substantial work or incurred
substantial liabilities in good faith reliance on the terms of the permit. See Avco Community
4 Developers v. South Coast Regional Commission, (1976) 17 Cal.3d 785; Dobbins v. City of Los

5 Angeles, (1904) 195 U.S. 233.
58. The Parsons own an STR within the City of Indian Wells. Pursuant to the STR regulations

7 at the time, the Parsons registered this property with the City to obtain an STR permit. The

8 Parsons relied on the permit language allowing seven-day minimum stay when they invested
9 approximately $1.5 million into their STR property. The Parsons' reliance on the permit language
10 was reasonable because the seven-day minimum stay was preserved for grandfathered permits, per
11 the Last Chance Notice, and communications from the City. The Parsons' right to operate the STR

12 as set forth in the permit therefore became a vested right.

13 59. Ordinance No. 710 requires HOAs and country clubs to either be subject to the City's 29-
14 day minimum stay requirements, or indicate their intent by an ill-defined process to opt out of the

15 ban and allow STRs. The Ordinance exempts new developments. There are no protections for
16 existing permit holders who have been grandfathered in, but do not live in a HOA or a Country
17 Club, or for those grandfathered permit holders whose HOA does not follow the procedure
18 identified by the Ordinance. The Parsons's limited purpose HOA has not yet voted to allow STRs,
19 and even if it did, the vote as prescribed by the City would not change the CC&Rs for the Parsons
20 HOA which have specifically allowed rentals of property for nearly 70 years. See Petitioner's CC

21 & Rs attached as Exhibit "E"

22 60. As drafted, the Ordinance violates the Parsons' vested right to operate their STRs in
23 accordance with the terms of his permits, in turn, violating the California Constitution, the United
24 States Constitution, and 42 U.S.C. section 1983.

25 61.42. U.S.C § 1988 allows prevailing parties in Section 1983 actions to recover reasonable
26| attorneys' fees. To the extent that Petitioners are deemed to be the prevailing parties on this cause
27 of action, they are entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys' fees.

2 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

3 Declaratory Relief for Taking Without Just Compensation

4 62. Petitioners incorporate by this reference the allegations in paragraphs 1 though 61 above,
of this Petition

6 63.42 U.S.C. § 1983 states that any person who is deprived of any "rights, privileges, or
immunities secured by the Constitution and laws... "by virtue of an ordinance may seek redress
for any injuries sustained.

8 64. The California Constitution states that "Private property may be taken or damaged for a
public use and only when just compensation ... has first been paid to ... the owner." Cal. Const.
10 art. I § 19. The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution has a similar provision
11 requiring just compensation for private property that is taken for a public use.

12 65. Regulations or ordinances depriving a property owner of all or substantially all of the
13 economic use or benefit of real property are regulatory takings, subject to the takings provisions in
14 the United States Constitution and the California Constitution. See Kavanau V. Santa Monica Rent
15 Control Bd., (1997) 16 Cal.4th.761, 774; Agins v. City of Tiburon, (1979) 24 Cal. 3d 266, 277.
16 Regulatory Takings are evaluated by: "(1) [t]he economic impact of the regulation on the
17| claimant'; (2) 'the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed
18 expectations'; and (3) 'the character of the governmental action. €C Allegretti & Co. y. County of
19 Imperial, (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 1261, 1277 citing Penn Cent. Trasnp. Co. V. New York City,
20 (1978) 438 U.S. 104, 124.

21 66. Ordinance No. 710 has a sunset provision for grandfathered permits beginning January 1,
22 2020 ("Sunset Provision") that, if enforced, functions as a regulatory taking. (Ordinance section
23 5.20.230.) The Sunset Provision converts all grandfathered STR properties from the seven-day
24 minimum stay requirement to the 29-day minimum stay requirement, with a brief exception for the
25 duration of the annual professional tennis tournament at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden, effective
26 January 1, 2020. (Ordinance section 5.20.220.)

27

LEWIS 28 67. As drafted, the Ordinance requires STR owners to abide by the 29-day minimum stay for

BRISBOIS
BISGAARD 11 months out of the calendar year-effectively removing STRs from the City except during the
4831-7201-5977.2

& SMIH LIP 14

INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 tennis tournament. If enforced, this provision will cause all STR owners within the City of Indian

2 Wells to incur significant economic losses, including a loss of all or substantially all revenue from
3 their STR operations, and depriving them of the use and benefit of these properties beginning

4 January 1, 2020.

5 68. Although the City may offer just compensation, or in the alternative, provide for a

6 reasonable amortization period in lieu of compensation, the Ordinance does not provide STR

7 owners a meaningful opportunity to recover their investments, as required by California law. See
8 Metromedia Inc. v. City of San Diego, (1980) 26 Cal. 848. (Amortization periods must be
9 commensurate with the investment involved). By comparison, most adequate amortization periods

10 allow five or more years, depending on the investment involved.

11 69. The Parsons invested approximately $1.5 million in their STR based on the language in the

12 permit, and communications from the City of Indian Wells about the minimum-stay duration.
13 However, the Ordinance Sunset Provision violates the terms of the permit and conflicts with
14 communications from the City by terminating the favorable minimum-stay terms in January, 2020.

15 70. For this reason, the a Ordinance is a regulatory taking without just compensation, in
16 violation of the Parsons' civil rights under 42 U.S.C. 1983. To the extent that the Parsons are

17 deemed the prevailing parties on this cause of action, they are entitled to an award of reasonable
18 attorneys' fees under 42. U.S.C § 1988.

19 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

20 Declaratory Relief for Violation of the Right to Due Process Under the Law

21 71. Petitioners incorporate by this reference the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 70 above,

22 of this Petition

23 72. The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that: "po state shall
24 make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United
25 States; nor shall .any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of

26 law."

1 73. The California Constitution provides the same protection for due process of law: "a person

2 may not be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law ...." Cal. Const. art. 1,
3 § 7.
74. Improper government interference with property rights and irrational, arbitrary actions by
I decision-makers are deemed violations of constitutional due process protections. County of

6 Sacramento v. Lewis, (1998) 523 U.S. 833, 846; Dodd v. Hood River County (gth Cir. 1995) 59
F.3d 852, 864.

8 75.42 U.S.C. § 1983 states that any person who is deprived of any "rights, privileges, or
9 immunities secured by the Constitution and laws... " by virtue of an ordinance may seek redress
10 for any injuries sustained.

11 76.42. U.S.C § 1988 allows prevailing parties in Section 1983 actions to recover reasonable
12 attorneys' fees. To the extent that Petitioners are deemed to be the prevailing parties on this cause
13 of action, they are entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys' fees.

14 77. The Ordinance, and particularly, the Sunset Provision, deprives the Parsons of their
15 property rights without substantive due process of law, in violation of both the United States
•16 Constitution and the California Constitution.

17 78. The claimed purpose of Ordinance No. 710 is to "enhance and maintain the residential
18 |l character of [the City's] residential zones." (Ordinance recitals.) However, the City arbitrarily

19 terminated the Parsons' property rights by adopting an ordinance with: sunset provision, after the

20 City issued communications and publications suggesting that subsequent minimum stay provisions
21 would not apply to grandfathered STR permits. The Ordinance also conflicts with the terms of the
22 City-issued STR permit to the Parsons. As drafted, the Ordinance imposes substantial economic

23 harm on the Parsons and other STR owners in the City by severely restricting STRs, including

24 those grandfathered into less restrictive minimum stay requirements. There is no discernable
25 connection between the Ordinance's claimed public purpose, and terminating the grandfathered

26 STRs.

27 79. By contrast, existing City STR regulations established by Ordinance No. 689 have proven

LEWIS 28 effective in preserving the residential character of the City's neighborhoods. For example, the

ATIORNEYS AT LAW INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 nuisance abatement provisions in Ordinance No. 689 reduced the number of nuisance Notice
2 Violations from seven (2014 through 2015) to only one (2016 through 2017). As evidenced by the
3 lack of nuisance Notice Violations, additional regulations are unnecessary for protecting the
character of Indian Wells' neighborhoods. The City's arbitrary termination of the grandfathered
5 STR permits is therefore a violation of Petitioners' due process rights.

6 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

7 Declaratory Relief for Violation of Equal Protection of the Laws

8 80. Petitioners incorporate by this reference the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 79 above,
9 of this Petition

10 81. The Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution provides that no state shall

11 "deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." Similarly, the
12 California Constitution provides that "a person may not be denied equal protection of the laws

13 ."3 Cal. Const. art I, 7. The Equal Protection Clause is violated where a government body

14 exposes a person or group to arbitrary discrimination by treating them differently than others
15 similarly situated, without a rational basis for such treatment. Village of Willowbrook v. Olech,

16 (2000) 528 U.S. 562, 564. Under both federal and state laws, persons who are similarly situated
17 with respect to the legitimate purpose of a law must be treated alike under the law. Cleburne v.

18 Cleburne Living Center, Inc. (1985) 473 U.S. 432, 439; Cooley v. Superior Court (2002) 29
19 Cal.App.4th, 228, 253.

20 82. 42 U.S.C. § 1983 states that any person who is deprived of any "rights, privileges, or
21 immunities secured by the Constitution and laws... " by virtue of an ordinance may seek redress
22 for any injuries sustained.

23 83.42. U.S.C § 1988 allows prevailing parties in Section 1983 actions to recover reasonable
24| attorneys' fees. To the extent that Petitioners are deemed the prevailing parties on this cause of
25 action, they are entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys' fees.

26 84. The Ordinance violates the equal protection clauses of the California and United States

27 Constitutions by inexplicably treating owners of STRs in new developments, and owners of STRs

LEWIS 28 within HOAs or Country Clubs differently than other owners of STRs. As the stated purpose of
BRISBOIS 4831-7201-5977.2 17
BISGAARD
& SMITH LIP VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECALARATORY AND

ATTORNEYS AT LAW INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 the Ordinance is to preserve residential characteristics and accurately calculate and collect
2 Temporary Occupancy Taxes, there is no rational basis for treating these groups differently from

3 Petitioners.

85. However, the Ordinance allows property owners within HOAs and Country Clubs to
determine their own STR regulations, including minimum stay requirements, subject to specific

6 voting requirements. (Ordinance sections 5.20.190; 5.20.210). Property owners outside of HOAs
7 and Country Clubs do not enjoy this discretion. This suggests that the residential characteristics of
8 neighborhoods in HOAs or Country Clubs are in no way threatened by existing minimum stay
9 requirements. However, the City applies a different standard to properties that are not within an
10 HOA or Country Club, without a rational basis for doing so.

11 86. Because the Ordinance significantly restricts property rights for some STR owners under
12 the guise of protecting neighborhood characteristics, while arbitrarily allowing for self regulation
13 of STRS in certain neighborhoods, the Ordinance violates Petitioners' right to equal protection of
14 the law, under both state and federal theories.

15 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

16 Injunction Against Enforcement of Ordinance No. 710

17 87. Petitioners incorporate by this reference the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 86 above,

18 of this Petition.

19 88. The City violated mandatory CEQA procedures by adopting Ordinance No. 710 without
20 meaningful review of potential impacts on the environment. If enforced, the Ordinance will

21 violate the United States and California Constitutions, depriving the citizens of Indian Wells of
22 fundamental vested rights, fundamental due process and equal protection rights. For all of these
23 reasons, and the reasons set forth above, the Ordinance is void, and the City's enforcement of the
24 Ordinance must be permanently enjoined.

25 RELIEF REQUESTED
26 WHEREFORE, Petitioners respectfully requests this Court to grant the following relief:

27 1. A Writ of Mandate setting aside the Ordinance for failure to comply with
LEWIS 28 CEQA, coupled with an order that no action be taken to enforce the Ordinance.

6. Damages in an amount that exceeds $1,000,000 and to be proven at trial to

8 compensate for the City's taking of the Parsons's property.

Indian Wells has vacation rental ordinance finally

•. en 10 -, 4- p.. 4l t.

Sherry Barkas, The Desert Sun Published 5:41 p.m. PT June 4, 2015
• -s.e..u..s

After more than a year of discussion and lengthy public hearings, the city of Indian Wells has a new short-term
rentals ordinance that allows for minimum stays of seven days for anyone who registers their property with the
city within a 30-day period.

"After a long and torturous journey, we unanimously adopted a compromise pian which recognizes both the
city's financial dependence on tourism and the need to protect our residents' right to enjoy their homes in
quiet," Mayor Pro Tem Dana Reed said Thursday.
(Photo: Desert Sun file photo)
The ordinance goes into effect July 4, when a 14-month moratorium on vacation rentals will be lifted. At that
point, anyone who wants to grandfather their home in to qualify for the seven-day minimum stay, must register with the city no later than Aug. 3.

"After that registration period, owners can still get a license, but cannot operate for period less than 29 days, except for the tennis tournament, when
they can rent for seven-day minimum," said David Gassaway, assistant to the city manager.

On July 4, 2018, the seven-day minimum expires and vacation rentals under 29 days will no longer be allowed in Indian Wells, except, again, during the
BNP Paribas Open.

The ordinance doesn't affect HOAs, which can set their own policies.

"I think that, for the time being, it's very good compromise," Councilman Ted Mertens said.

The struggle for a new ordinance started in May 2014, following complaints of loud parties at a couple of homes during the annual music festivals and
other major events.

On Wednesday only one person spoke and that was for clarification of wording in the ordinance. source=BENBjun&utm_medium=nanobarap8
exchange&utm_campaign=SUMMER18)
Jon Romer, who has owned his home since 2007, told the council on May 21, when they did the first vote on the ordinance that it seemed like the city
was trying to eliminate short-term rentals.

"We are a resort community. We should be doing everything possible to attract visitors. TOT is mother's milk of fiscal sanity in this city," he said. "If others
want a more provincial view, SO be it. But that seems totally contradictory to the grandfather provision.

"Grandfather is someone who is there in perpetuity, not a window in time. People who play inside the rules generate revenue for the community."

Many who favor the vacation homes are those who bought property in indian Welis as a second home to one day retire to. in the meantime, they hoped
to subsidize the cost for the home through short-term rentals.

The ordinance gives them three years to decide what they want to do with their property long term, Mertens said.

"We'll also have the opportunity to see if the expected occupancy transient tax pans out," he said.

The city is estimating $75,000 to $150,000 per year TOT revenue from the short-term rentals.

Along with noise ordinance, fines for public disturbance violations and a maximum occupancy of two people per bedroom that the council approved in
January, Mertens said he believes the city will have a good handie on short-term rentais.

The new ordinance takes into account suggestions by resident Michael Andelson that require advertisements for the vacation homes to state the
maximum two-person per bedroom occupancy and seven-day minimum stay mandates.

"The ordinance's objective is supposed to minimize enforcement from city," Andelson told council members at the May 21 meeting.
