INTRODUCTION

2 l. This action challenges the December 12, 2017 decision of Respondents and

3 Defendants City of San Jose and City of San Jose City Council (collectively, "San Jose")

4 d to approve a General Plan Amendment that would allow up to 728 residential dwelling
units, or over Imillion square feet of commercial/office uses, a on a contaminated site that

6 is currently developed with parking areas and two single-family, historic homes and

7 surrounded by residential uses, without preparing : water supply assessment and an
8 environmental impact report ("EIR"), as required by the California Environmental
9 Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code § 21000, et seq.) ("CEQA").
10 2. Instead, San Jose prepared a legally deficient "negative declaration" analyzing
11 337 residential dwelling units and 8,800 square feet of commercial, but concluding that

12 the full scope of" future development allowed by the General Plan Amendment and future

13 rezoning will result in no significant impacts and require no mitigation; despite the fact
14 that substantial evidence shows that future development allowed by the General Plan
15 Amendment and rezoning may result in potentially significant environmental effects,
16 requiring the City lo prepare an EIR.

17 3. By adopting the Fourth and St. John General Plan Amendment and Rezoning
18 | Project Negative Declaration (Resolution No. 78453) ("Negative Declaration") and
[9 approving the Fourth and St. John General Plan Amendment (City File No. GP16-013)
20 (Resolution No. 78454) (collectively "Project*), San Jose prejudicially abused its
21 discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law by failing to comply with
22 the substantive and procedural mandates of the CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines (Title
23 14. California Code of" Regulations, § 15000 et seq.) (*CEQA Guidelines").
24 4. The Negative Declaration is legally defective due to its failure to analyze the

25 full scope of" future development allowed by the Project, failure-to assess the Project's
26 impacts compared to the existing environment and improper deferral of analysis of
27 Project impacts and identification of required mitigation measures, among other legal
28 deficiencies,

VERIFIED PETITION FOR MRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

+116-000acp

The City failed to prepare an EIR, despite the fact that substantial evidence
2. shows the Project may cause significant unmitigated environmental effects on public

3 health, aestheties, historie resources, traffic, air quality, water quality, water supplies,

e Nooding, land uses and public services and from greenhouse gas emissions and
contamination. Potentially significant adverse impacts of the Project that have not been

0 analyzed or mitigated include, but are nöt limited to, the following:

a. Public and worker health and safety and environmental impacts
resulting from future development disturbing known soil and
9 groundwater contamination exposing workers, future site occupants, the
10 public and the environment to hazardous materials, including, but not
limited to, benzene, a cancer-causing chemical;
~n 7'o b. Aesthetic impacts due 10 increased densities and greater building heights
than what currently exists on the Project site adjacent to residential uses
to the north, south and east, and residential and commercial uses to the

west;

1G Historie resource impacts due to substantial adverse changes on two
single family homes that are eligible for listing on the California
18 Register of Historical Resources and located on the Project site, and on
19 other historic resources within 200 feet of the Project site;
20 d. Air quality and public health impacts from future development

21 generating particulate matter and toxic air contaminants near sensitive
receptors,:
Traflic impacis due to the Project's trip generation exceeding traffic
24 thresholds that require a project-specific traffic study and mitigarion;
25. & Flooding impacts due to the Project site being subject to flooding,

S 1OALA according to the Santa Clara Valley Water District, and

VERIFIED PETITION FORMRIT O MANDA' E AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

16-(R)3sic

g.
2 Water supply impacts due to the Project's incremental increase in water

LJ demands and lack of a required water supply assessment; among other
impacts.

4 6.

5 CEQA reflects a strong preference in favor of preparation of an EIR. A

6 negative declaration is appropriate only when there is not even a "fair argument" that El
project may have any significant adverse environmental impacts whatsoever. The
7 Negative Declaration is legally improper because, as discussed above, substantial

8 evidence from experts, other agencies and even San Jose itself shows the Project may
9 resultin significant impacts on public health and the environment.
10 7.

II CEQA requires analysis of the environmental effects of a project at the earliest

12 possible stage in the planning process. When a negative declaration has been adopted for
a project, no subsequent environmental review shall be prepared unless the lead agency
13 delermines that either substantial changes are proposed in the project (defined in the
14 Negative Declaration as a General Plan Amendment and Rezoning and up to 728 residential
15 cwelling units, or up to l,189,200 square feet of commercial/office uses), or
16 circumstances under which the project is undertaken, which will require major revisions
17

18 of' the previous negative declaration, or new information, which was not known and could

19 not have been known at the time the previous negative declaration was adopted, becomes
available.

20 8.

21 Here, substantial evidence is known now that the Project may result in
potentially significant impucts.

22 9. The Negative Declaration's deficiencies appear, in part, to result from San
23 Jose's rush to approve che Project before the end of December 2017 without allowing
24 sufficient time to address in a meaningful way the unresolved environmental, public

25

26 health and community impacts of the Project.

10. a As a result of San Jose's violations of CEQA, Petitioners and thousands of
27 local residents living and working in San Jose and represented by Petitioners

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

organizational members were denied their right to fully and meaningfully participate in
the permitting process for the Project.
N. Further, by udopting the Negative Declaration and approving the Project

4 without a water supply assessment, San Jose violated the Water Code, section 10910 et
seq.

0 12. The improper permitting will expose Petitioners, Petitioners' members and the
7. public to illegal and avoidable pollution and other environmental impacts.
8 13. Because San Jose's approval of the Project violates the requirements of CEQA,
9 the CEQA Guidelines and the Water Code, the approval must be overturned. Therefore,
10 Petitioners request the Court direct San Jose to set aside its actions (a) adopting the
1} Negative Declaration and (b) approving the Project.

9 Residents' members include residents of the City of San Jose and Santa Clara County,

11 aesthetics, historic resources, public infrastructure and quality of life. Their interests in
12 public health, workplace salety, clean air, clean water, less traffic, sound public
13 infrastructure and prolection of historic resources, among other interests, will be

14 adversely affected if the Project is permitted without proper analysis and mitigation of its
15 enviconmental impacts. Residents' members are concerned with, and will be affected
16 by, the release of hazardous materials, air pollution, adverse impacts on traffic and

17 climate change, and other environmental impacts caused by the Project.
18 17. Residents have an interest in enforcing environmental laws that encourage
a 19 sustainable development and ensure a safe working environment for its members. Poorly
20 planned projects adversely affect the economic well being of people who perform
21 construction work and the surrounding communities. Projects that impact local
22 communities jeopardize future jobs by making it more difficult and more expensive for
23 businesses to locate and people to live in the area. Individual members may also work on
24 nture development allowed by the Project itself. They will, therefore, be first in line to

25 be exposed to any health and safety hazards that exist onsite. Absent adequate disclosure
26 and mitigation of contamination, workers and the public may be subject to chronic health
27 problems and the risk of bodily injury and death. The participants in Residents are

17 STATEMENT OF FACTS

18 A. The Project
19 70. Pettioners hereby re-allege and incorporate by reference the preceding
20 paragraphs in their entirely, as if fully set forth herein.

21 71. The Project site is located at 120 North Fourth Street on an approximately 0.91
22 gross acre site at the northeast corner of Fourth Street and St. John Street in the City of
23 San Jose.

24 72. The Project site is currently developed with parking areas and two single

25 family homes that are eligible for listing on the California Register of Historical

26 Resources.

27 73. The Project is a General Plan Amendment to the Envision San Jose 2040

28 General Plan (o include the Project site into the Downtown Growth Area and to change

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

.116-000acp 15

the General Plan land use designation on the site from *Residential Neighborhood" and
3*Transit Residental" to Downtown."
74. On the portion of the Project site designated "Residential Neighborhood," the

44 Project's "Downtown" land use designation changes allowable density from
5 approximately 8 dwelling units per acre ("DU/AC") for residential uses and a floor-to-

6 area ratio ("FAR") of up to 0.7 for commercial/office uses to 800 DU/AC and a FAR of
7 up to 30.0.

8 75. On the smaller portion of the Project site designated "Transit Residential," the
9 Downtown" land use designation changes allowable density on. the Project site from up
10 io 250 DUIAC for residential and a FAR of up to 12.0 for commercial/office uses to 800
N- DU/AC and a FAR of up 1o 30.0.
12 76. The expansion of the Downtown Growth Area boundary and "Downtown"
:13 land use designation would allow up to 728 dwelling units, or up to 1,189,200 square feet
14 of commercial/office uses, on the 0.91 gross acre Project site.

15 77. The project described in the Negative Declaration also includes a Rezoning of
16 the site from General Commercial Zoning District to Downtown Primary Commercial
17 Zoning District (C17-032).
18 78. On December 5, 2017, the Applicant withdrew its application for Rezoning

19 (C17-032). The Negative Declaration was not revised lo climinale the Rezoning from the
20. project purportedly analyzed by the environmental review document:
21 79. San Jöse's Notice of Determination informs the public that San Jose adopted
22 the Fourth and St. Jöhin General Plan Amendment and Rezoning Project Negative

23 Declaration.

24 B. Environmental Review

26 paragraphs in their entirety, as if fully set forth herein:
.2 8. On Oclober 23. 2017. San Jose's Interim Director of Planning, Building and
% Code Enlorcement signed the Negative Declaration for the Fourth and St. John General

116 003acg 16

• Plan Amendment and Rezoning (GP16-013 and C17-032).

2 82. On October 24, 2017, San Jose provided public notice that the San Jose

3 Planning Commission would hold a hearing on November 15, 2017 to consider

4 recommending that the City Council adopt the Negative Declaration and approve the
General Plan Amendment and Rezoning. At the same time, San Jose released the

6 Negative Declaration for public reyiew.

7 83. The Negative Declaration explained that the Project allows up to 800 dwelling

8 units per acre for residential uses and a floor-to-arca ratio of up to 30.0 for
9 commercial/office uses: the Project site is currently developed with parking areas and two
10 single family homes; and the Project allows up to 728 dwelling units, or up to 1,189,200
I1 square fect of commercial/office uses, on the 0.91 gross acre Project site.

12 84. Despite this massive expansion in allowable development on the Project site,

13 the Negative Declaration concluded that future development on the Project site would
14 have a less-than-significant impact on every single resource arca.

15 85, The public review period provided for the Negative Declaration for the
16 General Plan Amendment and Rezoning was 20 days and ended on November 13, 2017.

17 86. On November 13, 2017, prior to the close of the public comment period,
18 Petitioners submitted written comments on the Negative Declaration.
19 87. Petitioners' comments explained how the Negative Declaration is legally
20 defective due its failure to analyze future development allowed by the Project, failure to

21 assess the Project's impacts compared to the existing environment and improper deferral
22 |of analysis of Project impacts and identification of required mitigation measures, among
23 other legal deficicncies.

24 88. Petitioners' comments included substantial evidence based on facts, from

25 experts, from other agencies and even from San Jose itself that the Project may result in
26 significant adverse public health and environmental affects that were not disclosed,

27 analyzed or mitigated in the Negative Declaration and that require preparation of an EIR,

28 including, but not limied to. the following;

7

18 Traffic impacts due to the Project's trip generation exceeding traffic

19 thresholds that require a project-specific traffic study and mitigation,
among other impacts.
20 89. Santa Clura Vallcy Water Districi's comments explained that the Negative
21 Decluration incorrectly siates that the Project site is not subject to flooding from failure of
22

23 dam, that the District's maps show the Project site would in fact be subject to flooding

24 from either the failure of Leniham Damn on Lexingion Reservoir or Anderson Dam, and
that the Negative Declaration states impacts from flooding will not be significant since
25 the Project site is nol within a FEMA Nood hazard zone, but that FEMA flood mapping

6

2 does nol map flooding thiat may ocour due fo failure of a dami
90 Sania Clara Valley Water District also explained that the Project would allow
8 up j0 728 residences on the Projeci site and that the Negative Declaration states the

4116-003Re

Project would incrementally increase water demands, but doesn't state that a required
2 water supply assessment was completed to justify that the Project will have no significant
3 impacts on water supplies.

41 91. Based on these and other comments, Petitioners recommended that San Jose

5 prepare an environmental impact report to disclose and mitigate the Project's potentially

( significant impacts, and resolve the errors and omissions, and circulate the EIR for public
review and comments.

8 C. Project Approval
92. Petitioners hereby re-allege and incorporate by reference the preceding

10 paragraphs in their entirety, as if fully set forth herein.
11 93. On November 15, 2017, the San Jose Planning Commission held a public

12 hearing to consider the Negative Declaration and General Plan Amendment and
13 Rezoning, but continued the public hearing 1o December 6, 2017.

14 94. On December 5, 2017, the Applicant withdrew its application for Rezoning

15 (CI7-032).

16 95. Following the Applicant's withdrawal of its application for Rezoning, San Jose
17 did not revise the project considered in the Negative Declaration for the Fourth and St.
18 John General Plan Amendment and Rezoning (GP16-013 and C17-032).
19 96. On December 6, 2017, the San Jose Planning Commission held a public
20 hearing to consider the Negalive Declaration und the Project. Prior to the conclusion of
21 the Planning Commission hearing, Petitioners objected to adoption of the Negative
22 Declaration and approval of the Project. The Planning Commission then recommended
23 that the City Council adopt the Negative Declaration and approve the Project.
24 97. On December 12, 2017, the San Jose City Council held a public hearing on the
25 Project.

26 98. At the City Council hearing for the Project, Petitioners objected to San Jose's
27 adoption of'the Negulive Declaration and approval of tlie Project,

by Resolution No. 78454.
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
3 Violations of CEQA

14 (Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.)
15. 100. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate herein by reference the preceding
16  paragraphs in their entirety.
17 101.1 CEQA prohibits local agencies from approving projects that may have adverse
18 environmental effects without first undergoing environmental review and avoiding or

9 reducing the significant environmental effects of those projects whenever feasible:
20 102. a CEQA reflecis n strong preference in favor of preparing an EIR.
2 103. A negative declaration is improper, and an EIR is required whenever
substantial evidence in the record supports a "fair argument' that a project "may have"
23 any significant environmental impact. Even if other substantial evidence supports the

24 opposite conclusion, the agency nevertheless must prepare an EIR: (Pub. Resources:
25 Codè 8 21080, subd (d).)

0 104. As a matter ol law; "substantial evidence" includes facts, reasonable
2 ussumptions predicated on fucis and cxpert opinion supported by facts. (Pub. Resources
Codè S 1080. subd (e)( 1). CEQA Guidelines § 15064, subd. (F(5).)

VERIRIED PE TELION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMÉLAINT FOR DECLARATOR Y AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEE

F16-003HCh

105. "[Thhe sufficiency of the evidence to support a fair argument" is a question of
2 law. (Sierra Club v. County of Sonoma (1992) 6 Cal.App.4 1307, 1318.) "Under this
standard, deference to the agency's determination is not appropriate and its decision not

4 to require an EIR can be upheld only where there is no credible evidence to the contrary."
5 (Id. (emphasis added).)

6 106. Under CEQA, a "project" means "the whole of an action, which has potential

7 for resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably

8 f'oresceable indirect physical change in the environment." (CEQA Guidelines § 15378.)

9 "*The term *project' refers to the activity which is being approved and which may be
10 subject to several discretionary approvals by governmental agencies. The term 'project'
11 does not mean each separate governmental approval." (15378, subd.(c).)

12 107. A public agency may not segment large project into two or more smaller
13 projects in order to mask serious environmental consequences. CEQA prohibits such a

14 piecemeal approach and requires review of a project's impacts as a whole. (CEQA a
15 Guidelines 15378.) CEQA mandates "that environmental considerations do not
16 become submerged by chopping a large project into many little ones - each with a
17 minimal potential impact on the environment - which cumulatively may have disastrous
18 consequences." (Bozung V. Local Agency Formation Commission (1975) 13 Cal.3d 263,
19 283-84.)
20 108.
21 Before approving a project, a lead agency must assess the environmental

22 impacts of all reasonably foresecable phases of a project. (Laurel Heights Improvemen!

23 Assn. v. Regents of University of California, 47 Cal.3d. 376, 398.)

109.
24 If an environmental review document "does not adequately apprise all

25 interested parties of the true scope of the project for intelligent weighing of all

26 environmental consequences of the project, informed decisionmaking cannot occur under

27 CEQA and the final [environmental review document] is inadequale as a malter of law."

28 (Riverwaich v. Olivenhain Municipal Water Dist. (2009) 170 Cal.App. 1b 1186, 1201.)

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

4116-00Jucp 21

10. It is well established that an agency must analyze the future development
contemplated in 4 plan amendment. (City of Redlands v San Bernardino County (2002)
96 Cal.App.4 398, 409; Chrisnward Ministryv. Superion Court (1986) 184 Cal.App. 3d
180, 194. CEQA requires analysis of the environmental effects of a project at the earliest
possible stage in the planning process. (City of Redlands v. San Bernardino County, 96
6 Cal.App.4# at 410.) When a Court reviews whether there was an omission of required
information from an environmental review document, it reviews whether (1) the
8 document did not contain information required by law and (2) the omission precluded
9

10 informed decisionmaking. (Madera Oversight Coalition, Inc. y. County of Madera (2011).

N. 199 Cal.App.4th 48, 76-77; Clover Valley Found. v. City of Rocklin (2011) 197

12 Cal.App.4th 200, 211 (courts "scrupulously enforc[e] all legislatively mandated CEQA

13 | requirements").)

14 11. CEQA requires : lead agency to assess a project's impacts on the environment.

15 (Pub. Res. Code § 21002. 1(a), 21061; CEQA Guidelines § 15125). Any significant
16  impacts must be miligated or avoided to the extent feasible. (Pub. Res. Code $§ 21002,
i7 21002.1. subd. (b), 21081, 21080.5 subd. (d)(3)(A).)

18 112. CEQA requires the lead agency to include a description of the physical

19 environmental conditions in the vicinity-of a project as they exist at the time
20 environmental review commences. (CEQA Guidelines $ 15125(a).) The description of

21 the environmental setting constitutes the baseline physical conditions by which a lead
2 22 lagency may assess the significance of the project's impacts.
23 13: To determine whether a project will have a significant impact, the lead agency
:24 must first identify the relevant "environment," and then determine whether the projéct
5 will cause a"significant effect on the environment," (Pub. Res. Code $ 21002.1; 14 Cal
26 Code Reg. $8 15063 5064.)
14
8 The courts have repeatedly held that a project's impacts must be measured
against the existing physical conditions in the area, not the conditions thai could occur 7

-

2 under "an existing general plan." (Environmental Planning and Information Council v.

3 County of El Dorado (1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 350, 354.) Failure t0 do so misleads the

4 public and agency decisionmakers about the project's impacts. (/d. at p. 358.)
115.
5 A legally adequate environmental review document "must contain sufficient

6 detail to help ensure the integrity of the process of decisionmaking by precluding

7 stubborn problems or serious criticism from being swept under the rug." (Kings County

8 Farm Bureau V. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 733.) Mere conclusory

) Ipronouncements are not sufficient. "It must reflect the analytic route the agency

10 traveled from evidence to action." (Id.)

1I 116. At the time a city begins environmental review of' residential development with

12 over 500 units or a commercial office building having more than 250,000 square feet of

13 foor space, the city must identify any public water system that may supply water for the

14

15 project and request that the system prepare a water supply assessment for the project, or if
public water system is uninvolved, the city must prepare a water supply assessment.
16 (CEQA Guidelines § 15155; Water Code § 10910 et seq.) Both CEQA and the Water

17 Code require a city to include the water supply assessment in the environmental
18 document prepared for the project. (State CEQA Guidelines § 15155; Water Code §

19 10910 et seq.)
20 117. CEQA imposes an affinnative obligation on agencies to avoid or reduce
21 environmental harm by adopting feasible project alternatives or mitigation measures. f
22

23 substantial evidence shows a project may result in significant impacts, the lead agency

24 must then propose and evaluate mitigation measures and alternatives sufficient to

25 minimize these impacts. (Pub. Resources Code §§ 21002. 1(a), 21100(b)(3).) The lead

26 agency may not defer the formulation of mitigation measures to a future time. Mitigation

27 measures must be specific and enforceable. (Pub. Resources Code § 21081.6; CEQA

28 Guidelines 15126.4(a)(2).)

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

4116-003ucp 23

118. When a Lead Agency proposes to use an EIR from an earlier project as the EIR
for a separate, later project, the Lead Agency shall follow specific procedures for
analyzing the project, the environmental setting, the impacts and the alternatives and
4 mitigation measures. (CEQA Guidelines § 15153(b).).
5 119. Noncompliance with the requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines
6 constitutes prejudicial abuse of discretion under sections 21168 and 21 168.5 of the
7 Public Resources Code: regardless of whether a different outcome would have resulted if
8 the lead agency had complied with those requirements in the first place. (Pub. Res. Code
9 $ 21005.) Abuse of discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in the
10 munner required by law or if the agency's determination or decision is not supported by
11 substantial evidence in the administrative r'ecord. (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168, 21168.5.)
12 120. Acting as the CEQA lead agency, San Jose was at all times under a mandatory
13 duty lo comply with all requirements of CEQA prior to approving the discretionary
14 actions at issue in this lawsuit.
15 121. In approving che Project and adopting the Negative Declaration, San Jose
16 proceeded in excess. of its jurisdiction, abused its discretion,; and failed 10 proceed in a
17 manner required by Jasv in violation of CEQA by, inter alia:
