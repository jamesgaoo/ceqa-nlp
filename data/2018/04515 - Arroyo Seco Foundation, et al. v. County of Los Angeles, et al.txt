15 INTRODUCTION

16 1. This suit challenges the November 7, 2017 decision of Respondents voiding and setting

17 aside portions of the Final Environmental Impact Report ("FEIR") that was certified by the Board for

18 the Devil's Gate Reservoir Sediment Removal and Management Project in the Cities of Irwindale and

19 Pasadena ("Project") on November 12, 2014; certifying the Recirculated Portions of the FEIR

20 ("RFEIR"); adopting revisions to the Project's previously adopted Mitigation Monitoring and

21 Reporting Program ("MMRP") for the Project; adopting revisions to the Project's previously adopted

22 Environmental Finding of Fact; adopting findings that the District's actions were within the scope of the

23 previously adopted Statement of Overriding Considerations; approving modifications to the Project

24 without conducting further CEQA review; delegating authority to the Chief Engineer of the District to

25 execute an agreement with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to provide financial

26 assurances for compensatory mitigation; authorizing the a District to enter into a construction contract for

27 the clearing of the reservoir, excavation, transportation, and disposal of sediment and construction of

28 access roads and other improvements for the Project; authorizing the District to carry out the Project;

-

2 finding that it actions were within the scope of the previously certified Final Environmental Impact

3 Report ("FEIR") and RFEIR; and issuing a Notice of Determination ("NOD") in violation of the

4 California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code ("PRC"), §§ 21000, et seq., and the

5 CEQA Guidelines, 14 California Code of Regulations (CCR"), §§ 15000, et seq. (collectively
"CEQA").

6 2.

7 The Project involves the excavation and removal of 1.7 million cubic yards ("mcy") of

8 sediment from behind the Devil's Gate Dam and Reservoir ("Devil's Gate Dam" or "Reservoir"), a 115-
foot concrete flood control dam and adjoining reservoir built by the District in 1920 to provide flood
9 protection and water conservation for the cities of Pasadena, South Pasadena, and Los Angeles.

10 3.

11 The Project proposes to remove sediment that has accumulated in the Reservoir in the

12 past several years, including sediment that accumulated following the 2009 Station Fire, a forest fire that

13 burned approximately 160,000 acres of the. Angeles National Forest in the nearby San Gabriel

14 Mountains. In addition to removing accumulated sediment, the Project will establish a reservoir pool at

15 the face of the Dam, create a new reservoir configuration designed to store accumulated storm water and

16 groundwater recharge, and establish a 50-acre permanent maintenance area.

4.

17 The Project's excavation and construction activities will take place for 9 months a year,

18 over a 4 to 5-year period, and will require the use of up to 425 on-road sediment removal dump truck
trips per day during that time.

19 5. The Project site is located within Hahamongna Watershed Park (*Park"), a popular City
20 of Pasadena park with 330 acres of open space that creates a transitional area between the City's urban

21

22 land uses, neighboring foothill communities, and the Angeles National Forest. Project-related activities

23 will permanently destroy over 60 acres of sensitive riparian habitat within the Park. Overall, the Project
footprint will occupy approximately 76 acres of the 330-acre Park.

24 6.

25 The District originally proposed and approved a 2.4 mcy version of the Project in 2014,
in reliance on the 2014 FEIR.

26 7.

27 The 2014 FEIR concluded that the habitat loss caused by the Project would have

28 significant impacts on sensitive wildlife and plant species, but that those impacts would be reduced to
less than significant levels with the incorporation of the FEIR's eight biological mitigation measures,

-3-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 Mitigation Measures Biology 1 through 8.

2 8. The original FEIR also concluded that the Project would generate significant air pollutant

3 emissions from nitrogen oxides ("NOx") from the use of on-road dump trucks. The FEIR concluded

4 that NOx emissions would exceed applicable thresholds of significance set forth by the South Coast Air

5 Quality Management District ("SCAQMD"), resulting in a significant air quality impact. The FEIR

6 incorporated a mitigation measure, Mitigation Measure Air 1, which purported to require use of

7 sediment removal dump trucks that meet EPA's emission standards for Model Year 2007. The FEIR

8 concluded that the Project's NOx emissions would be reduced to less than significant levels with
9 implementation of Mitigation Measure Air 1.

10 9. Petitioners challenged the District's original 2014 Project approvals in the related lawsuit

11 of Arroyo Seco Foundation et al. v. County of Los Angeles et al., LASC Case Number BS152771 (case

12 filed December 11, 2014) ("ASF P').

13 10. On April 19, 2017, this Court issued its judgment in ASF. ("Judgment"), which found

14 that Mitigation Measures Biology 6, 7, and 8 failed to comply with CEQA because they failed to

15 provide substantial evidence supporting the FEIR's conclusion that a 1:1 mitigation ratio would reduce

16 the impacts to less than significant levels. The Judgment also found that Mitigation Measure Air

17 failed to include enforceable terms to ensure that NOx emissions would be reduced to less than

18 significant levels. The Court issued a Writ of Mandate ("Writ") on May 17, 2017, commanding the

19 District to rectify its CEQA violations.

20 11. The 2017 RFEIR was prepared in response to the Judgment and Writ in ASF I. The

21 RFEIR continued to analyze the original 2.4 mcy Project, and contained only a narrow set of revisions

22 which addressed three issues: (1) providing evidentiary support for the 1:1 biological mitigation ratios

23 proposed in Mitigation Measures Biology 6, 7, and 8; (2) applying the Project's biological mitigation
24 measures to another cumulative Project identified in the FEIR; and (3) revising Mitigation Measure Air

25 to state that the Project would use "Model Year 2010" dump trucks, rather than "Model Year 2007"

26 dump trucks as originally approved.

27 12. The RFEIR also added new terms to Mitigation Measures Biology 6, 7, and 8 that

28 required deferred development of a Habitat Restoration Plan and future development of adaptive

-4-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 management measures which the RFEIR assumed, without a site-specific analysis, would result in

2 successful mitigation of impacts to sensitive riparian habitat and species. The RFEIR failed to analyze

3 the new and significant biological impacts that would result from these new mitigation measures.

4 13. The RFEIR failed to address any new or changed circumstances surrounding the Project
since its original 2014 approval, and failed to advise the public of new information that had become

6 available since the original 2014 FEIR certification. For example, the RFEIR failed to consider several

7 recent air quality studies which demonstrate that NOx emissions from Model Year 2010 trucks are 5 to
18 times greater than the District originally analyzed when it certified the FEIR in 2014.

9 14. As t result of these deficiencies, the RFEIR failed to adequately disclose and mitigate the

10 Project's new and potentially significant impacts on biological resources, including endangered and

11 special-status bird and plant species, and the Project's significant, unmitigated air quality impacts, which

12 far exceeded the emissions that were originally analyzed and mitigated in the FEIR.

13 15. Petitioners and other members of the public submitted extensive public comments on the

14 RFEIR, supported by technical comments from highly qualified biological and air quality consultants.

15 Public comments identified these and other deficiencies in the RFEIR's impact analysis and mitigation

16 measures, and asked the District to recirculate the RFEIR.

17 16. The District failed to make any modifications to the RFEIR in response to Petitioners'

18 comments or the comments of other members of the public. The Board voted to certify the RFEIR and

19 issue related Project approvals at its November 7, 2017 hearing on the Project.

20 17. At the hearing, and with no prior notice to the public, the Board considered a reduced-

21 size version of the Project which would remove 1.7 mcy of sediment rather than the original 2.4 mcy.

22 Members of the public raised concerns about the need for further CEQA review to consider the reduced-

23 size Project, including, in particular, whether it would allow for a reduced Project footprint that would

24 reduce the Project's significant impacts from habitat removal. The Board failed to require further

25 CEQA review, and approved the reduced-size 1.7 mcy Project at the November 7, 2017 hearing.

26 18. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion and failed to proceed in the manner

27 required by law in modifying the Project and certifying a legally deficient RFEIR that failed to analyze

28 the modified Project's impacts and changed circumstances surrounding its approval.

-5-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- 19.

2 Respondents also abused their discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by

3 law by failing to consider new information which demonstrated that the Project would have new and
more severe impacts that previously analyzed.

4 20.

5 Finally, Respondents abused their discretion or proceeded in a manner inconsistent with

6 law in adopting findings that the majority of the Project's significant impacts - including biological and

7 air quality impacts - would be reduced to less than significant levels with mitigation, and that remaining

8 impacts were acceptable due to overriding considerations, and in determining that the MMRP was

9 adequate, when it fails to mitigate all of the Project's potentially significant impacts.
21.

10 Because the manner in which Respondents reviewed and approved the RFEIR and

11 Project violated CEQA, the certification and Project approvals must be set aside.

16 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS
17 Project History

18 29. The Project site is located in Pasadena, California in Los Angeles County. The cities of
19 La Cañada Flintridge and Altadena border the Project site. The Project site is administrated by the
20 Flood Control District pursuant to an easement granted for flood control purposes by the City of
21 Pasadena to the Flood Control District in 1919 and 1965.

22 30. The Dam, built in 1920 by the Flood Control District, is located in Pasadena, California
23 in Los Angeles County. The Dam, the very first flood control dam built in Los Angeles County, controls
24 flow from the Arroyo Seco, a 24.9 mile long seasonal river that captures rainfall and storm water.
25 31. Behind the Dam lies the Hahamongna Reservoir, a flood basin that after completion of
26 the Dam in 1920 had an original carrying capacity of approximately 7.4 million cy. Since then, the
27 Flood Control District has allowed sediment to regularly build up within the Reservoir, allowing overall
28 capacity to fluctuate between 3.4 to 4.9 million cy, with a historical average of approximately 4.3

-7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

F million cy.

2 32. The Project site is located within Hahamongna Watershed Park, a popular and important
3 park used for both recreational activities and biological resources. The Park is owned by the City of
4 Pasadena. The Park encompasses 330 acres of open space, and creates a transitional area between the
5 City's urban land uses, neighboring foothill communities, and the Angeles National Forest. Portions of
6 the Park are located behind the Dam. Over the years, critical parklands have become established on
7 areas of built-up sediment behind the Dam.

8 33. Due to its location at the foot of the San Gabriel Mountains, Hahamongna Watershed
9 Park a is a rare and unique environmental resource which provides key habitat for wildlife, more than 206
10 species of birds, at least 14 amphibian and reptile species, and 12 mammal species, including numerous
11 threatened special status plant and animal species such as the Yellow Warbler, coast range newt, Coast
12 Patch-nosed Snake, and the federally-endangered Least Bell's Vireo.
13 34. In 1998, the Flood Control District made improvements to the Dam, increasing the
14 Dam's capacity to efficiently pass water flows by allowing for earlier releases from the Reservoir during

on the 15 stormwater events ("1998 Improvements"). The 1998 improvements installed a larger spillway
16 Dam to automatically allow for an early release of water after the Reservoir's water level reaching
17 1040.5 feet above sea level. The 1998 Improvements still maintains the original holding level of the
18 Dam, holding water until it reaches an elevation of 1065 feet above sea level.

19 35. Sediment buildup in the Reservoir has varied widely over the years, ranging from
20 100,000 cy between 1992 to 1993 to 560,000 cy per year between the years of 1935 to 1938.
21 36. Over the years, Flood Control District has conducted at least 25 sediment removal
22 proposed for this Project, as well as sluicing, ranging in operations, utilizing a mix of excavation, as is

23 size from as small as 200,000 cy in 2009, via excavation, to 1.08 million cy in 1942, primarily via
24 sluicing.

25 37. At present, the Flood Control District is conducting interim sediment removal efforts,
26 removing approximately 25,000 cubic yards of sediment per year from the Reservoir.
27 38. The impetus for the Project came after the August 26, 2009 Station Fire. The fire, started
28 by an arsonist in the Angeles National Forest, burned nearly 252 square miles, including approximately

-8-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

75% of the Reservoir's surround watershed.

2 39. The 2009 Station Fire and two large rainy seasons in the two years after the Station Fire
3 caused approximately 1.1 million cy of sediment to flow into the Reservoir, lowering the capacity of the
4 Reservoir.

5 40. As originally approved, the Project proposed to remove 2.4 mcy of sediment from the
6 Reservoir and establish a reservoir management system to maintain flood control capacity at the
7 Reservoir in two phases.

8 41. As originally approved, the Project would permanently destroy over 60 acres of sensitive
9 riparian habitat within the Park to create a permanent maintenance area for the Project, including 1.1
10 acres of rare Riversidean Alluvial Fan Sage Scrub, 51.4 acres of Riparian Woodland and 11.1 acres of
11 Mule Fat Thickets.

12 42. The Project is partially funded by a grant from the State of California created by the
13 Disaster Preparedness and Flood Protection Bond Act of 2006 (Proposition 1E).
14 Procedural Background and Changes to Project

15 43. A Notice of Preparation and Initial Study for the Project ("NOP") was released on
16 September 28, 2011. A: 45-day comment period was held and multiple public hearings were held.
17 44. A Draft Environmental Impact Report (*DEIR") was released for the Project on October
18 23, 2013. The DEIR was held open for public comment for 75 days from October 23, 2013 till January
19 6, 2014, where subsequently the review period was extended for an additional 90 days until January 21,
20 2014. Three public meetings were held on November 6, 14, and 16, 2013.
21 45. A FEIR was released on October 20, 2014.

22 46. The DEIR and FEIR reviewed six alternatives. Alternative 1 Configuration B proposed to
23 remove approximately 2.8 million cy of sediment via excavation. Alternative 2 Configuration C
24 proposed to remove 4 million cy of sediment via excavation. Alternative 3 Configuration D, the
25 environmentally preferred alternative, proposes to remove approximately 2.4 million cy of sediment via
26 excavation. Alternative 4 proposes to remove approximately 2.9 million cy of sediment via sluicing.
27 Alternative 5 proposes to remove approximately 2.9 million cy of sediment via excavation using an
28 alternative haul route. Finally, the DEIR and FEIR also considered a No Project alternative.

-9.
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 47. On November 12, 2014, the Board, sitting as the Governing Board of the Flood Control

2 District, certified the FEIR, adopted findings and a Statement of Overriding Considerations, and

3 approved the Project, adopting Alternative 3 Configuration D, which would have removed 2.4 million

4 cy of sediment via excavation.

5 48. On December 11, 2014, Petitioners filed a lawsuit challenging the Flood Control

6 District's November 12, 2014 approval of the Project, ASF I.

7 49. On February 14 and March 23, 2017, the Court conducted hearings on the case, issued

8 tentative decision and adopted a final decision granting Petitioners' Petition for Writ of Mandate in part,

0 finding that the Project's FEIR was deficient as to Mitigation Measure Air Quality 1, Mitigation

10 Measures Biological Resources 6, 7, and 8, and the FEIR's cumulative impacts analysis.

11 50. The Court's February 14, 2017 tentative decision, which was ultimately adopted as

12 modified by the Reporter's Transcripts, found that the FEIR's analysis of the Project's impacts to

13 biological resources, as well as on air quality, were insufficient as the FEIR failed to provide substantial

14 evidence to support the FEIR's conclusion that a 1:1 habitat mitigation ratios adopted in Mitigation

15 Measures Biological Resources 6, 7, and 8 would mitigate the Project's impacts to biological resources

16 to less than significant levels. The Court also found that the FEIR failed to include enforceable terms in

17 Mitigation Measure Air Quality 1 to ensure that the Project's significant NOx emissions would be

18 reduced to less than significant levels.

19 51. The Court's March 23, 2017 tentative decision, which was ultimately adopted as

20 modified by the Reporter's Transcripts, found that the FEIR's analysis of cumulative impacts was

21 insufficient as the FEIR failed to state how cumulative impacts to biological resources such as special

22 status species, riparian habitat and other sensitive natural communities would be mitigated.

23 52. On April 19 and May 17, 2017, the Court issued a judgment and writ of mandate ordering

24 the Flood Control District to 1) void and set aside the November 12, 2014 certification of the portions of

6 53. On or about July 24, 2017, the County released RFEIR to the public for a 45-day public
7 comment period expiring on September 7, 2017, and issuing a Notice of Availability / Notice of
8 Completion to the State's Office of Planning & Research.
9 54. The RFEIR revised Pages ES12-16 (Executive Summary), Pages 83-85 (Section 3.5.6
10 AIR QUALITY - Impacts and Mitigation), Page 88 (Section 3.5.6 AIR QUALITY - Impacts and
11 Mitigation), Page 90 (Section 3.5.6 AIR QUALITY - Impacts and Mitigation), Pages 130-134 (Section
12 3.6.6 BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES - Impacts and Mitigation), Page 431 (Section 4.6.3
13 ALTERNATIVE 3, CONFIGURATION D - Impacts Analysis and Comparison to Proposed Project),
14 Pages 445-452 (Section 4.6.3 ALTERNATIVE 3, CONFIGURATION D - Impacts Analysis and
15 Comparison to Proposed Project), Page 553 (Section 4.8.3 ALTERNATIVE 5, CONFIGURATION A,
16 HAUL ROUTE ALTERNATIVE - Impact Analysis and Comparison to Proposed Project), Pages 561-
17 564 (Section 4.8.3 ALTERNATIVE 5, CONFIGURATION A, HAUL ROUTE ALTERNATIVE -
18 Impact Analysis and Comparison to Proposed Project), Pages 653-656 (Section 6.0 REFERENCES),
19 Page 673 (Section 8.0 CLARIFICATIONS AND MODIFICATIONS - Executive Summary), Page 676

21 (Section 8.0 CLARIFICATIONS AND MODIFICATIONS), Page 706 (Section 8.0 CLARIFICATIONS
22 AND MODIFICATIONS), Page 707 (Section 8.0 CLARIFICATIONS AND MODIFICATIONS), Page

25 MODIFICATIONS), Page 767 (Section 8.0 CLARIFCATIONS AND MODIFICATIONS), Pages 2054-
26 2059 (Section 10.0 MITIGATION MONITORING AND REPORTING PROGRAM) and added
27 Appendix L- Devils Gate CEQA Mitigation Site Comparison to the FEIR.
28 55. Identically to the FEIR. the RFEIR concluded that the Project would result in significant

-11-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 impacts to riparian habitats and sensitive habitats from permanent habitat loss and alteration caused by
2 Project activities. The RFEIR included eight mitigation measures to address significant biological
3 impacts.

4 56. The RFEIR modified previously approved Mitigation Measures Biology 6 and 8, which
5 proposed to mitigate the significant impacts from the Project's removal of alluvial fan sage scrub,
6 riparian habitat and other sensitive natural communities at a 1:1 ratio. In particular, Mitigation
7 Measures Biology 6 and 8 were modified to require the development of performance standards for
8 mitigation sites, post-approval preparation of a site-specific Habitat Restoration Plan, and to require the
9 implementation of adaptive management measures, such as corrective re-grading, soil amendments,
10 replanting, trail closures, and/or barrier installation at mitigation sites if mitigation sites are
11 | unsuccessful.

12 57. The RFEIR concluded that, with implementation of modified Mitigation Measures
13 Biology 6 and 8, the Project's impacts on riparian habitats and sensitive habitats would be less than
14 significant.

15 58. Also identically to the FEIR, the RFEIR concluded that the Project would result in
16 significant air pollutant emissions from NOx from the use of on-road sediment removal dump trucks.
17 Specifically, the RFEIR concluded that the Project's 425 haul trucks per day would generate significant
18 NOx emissions of 328 lbs/day, which vastly exceeds the SCAQMD's significance threshold of 100
19 Ibs/day, thereby resulting in a significant impact.
20 59. Just as the FEIR had, the RFEIR relied on the use of trucks that meet EPA's 2007
21 emissions standards to reduce NOx emissions to less than significant levels. However, the RFEIR
22 modified its previously approved Mitigation Measure Air Quality 1 to require the use of on-road
23 sediment removal dump trucks that were "Model Year 2010" or later, in an attempt to ensure that the
24 trucks met EPA's 2007 emissions standards.

25 60. The RFEIR concluded that, with implementation of the revised Mitigation Measure Air
26 Quality 1, the Project's air quality impacts from NOx emissions would be less than significant.
27 61. On or about September 8, 2017, the Flood Control District extended the public comment
28 for the RFEIR for an additional 10 days until September 17, 2017.

L 62.

2 The Flood Control District received comments from over 100 members of the public

3 regarding the RFEIR, including a number of comments from Petitioners and others which provided

4 substantial evidence demonstrating that the modifications to Biological Mitigation Measures 6 and 8
were inadequate to reduce biological impacts to less than significant levels.

5 63.

6 In particular, Petitioners' biological consultant explained that deferring establishment of

7 mitigation habitat performance standards and the site-specific Habitat Restoration Plan was improper

8 deferred mitigation under CEQA. Petitioners' comments provided substantial evidence demonstrating
that the proposed adaptive management measures could potentially cause new and additional significant
9 environmental impacts on biological and recreational resources that were not analyzed in the RFEIR.

10 64.

11 Petitioners and other members of the public also submitted evidence from air quality

12 experts demonstrating that the recent SCAQMD air quality studies, published after the Project's original

13 2014 approvals, concluded that Model Year 2010 trucks emit 5 to 5 18 times higher NOx emissions than

14 the emissions originally projected USEPA. Durbin, Thomas D, et al. (February 2017). Final Report:
Heavy-Duty Chassis Dynamometer Test Program.

15 65.

16 Petitioners' air quality experts concluded that, because Mitigation Measure Air Quality

17 relies exclusively on the use of Model Year 2010 trucks, the Measure will similarly result in higher,

18 unmitigated NOx emissions that are 5 to 18 times higher than the levels assumed in the RFEIR, resulting
in significant, unmitigated NOx emissions that the RFEIR failed to disclose.

19 66.

20 On or about October 26, 2017, the Flood Control District released Responses to

21 Comment for Recirculated Portions of the Final Environmental Impact Report and Mitigation

22 Monitoring and Reporting Program ("Response to Comments") to the public, responding to the various

23 public comments received during the public comment period on the RFEIR.

67.

24 The Response to Comments failed to adequately address the issues raised by Petitioners

25 and other members of the public. In particular, the Responses failed to make any alterations to the

26 Project or modifications to its mitigation measures to address the unmitigated impacts identified by
Petitioners and other members of the public.

27 68.

28 On November 7, 2017 the Board, sitting as the Governing Board of the Flood Control
District, conducted a public hearing on the RFEIR. Petitioners submitted written and oral comments at

-13-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

the hearing identifying the outstanding deficiencies in the RFEIR, and asked the District to recirculate
2 the RFEIR to correct these deficiencies prior to considering re-approval of the Project.
3 69. At the November 7 Board hearing, District Staff presented, for the first time, a November
4 7, 2017 technical memorandum, prepared by the District's environmental consultant, which
5 recommended reducing the size of the Project's sediment removal by 700,000 mcy, from 2.4 mcy to 1.7
6 mcy of total sediment removal. The technical memorandum was not included in the RFEIR, and was
7 not circulated for public comment. The memorandum did not address whether the reduction in Project
8 size could accommodate a smaller footprint in order to reduce biological impacts. The memorandum
9 also did not address any changes in the number, timing, or nature of trucks required for the reduced
10 sediment removal operations.

11 70. At the hearing, the Board discussed the viability of a reduced-size Project that would
12 remove 1.7 mcy of sediment from behind Devil's Gate Dam, rather than the 2.4 mcy that was originally
13 analyzed in the RFEIR. The Board voted to 1) reduce the maximum total volume of sediment removed
14 during the Project by 700,000 cubic yards, while maintaining the proposed footprint of the Project, 2)
15 voided portions of the Final Environmental Impact Report certified by the Board on November 12, 2014
16 that had been revised by the Recirculated Portions of the Final Environmental Impact Report, 3)
17 certified the RFEIR, 4) revised the Project's Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program, 5) adopted
18 a Statement of Overriding Considerations and 6) made related findings.
19 71. On or about November 8, 2017, a Notice of Determination for the Project was filed at the
20 County Clerk's Office and the State Clearinghouse.
21 LEGAL BACKGROUND

22 CEQA

23 72. CEQA requires that an agency analyze the potential environmental impacts of its
24 proposed actions in an environmental impact report ("EIR") (except in certain limited circumstances).
25 See, e.g., PRC § 21100.

26 73. The EIR is the very heart of CEQA. Dunn-Edwards v. BAAQMD (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th
27 644, 652. "The 'foremost principle' in interpreting CEQA is that the Legislature intended the act to be
28 read to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the

-14-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

statutory language." Cmtys. for a Better Env't v. Cal. Resources Agency (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98,
2 109.

3 74. CEQA has two primary purposes. First, CEQA is designed to inform decision makers and
4 the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of a project. 14 CCR § 15002(a)(1). "Its
5 purpose is to inform the public and its responsible officials of the environmental consequences of their
6 decisions before they are made. Thus, the EIR 'protects not only the environment but also informed self-
7 government.' Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564. The EIR has
8 been described as "an environmental 'alarm bell' whose purpose it is to alert the public and its
9 responsible officials to environmental changes before they have reached ecological points of no return."
10 Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay v. Bd. of Port Comrs. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1354 ("Berkeley
11 Jets").

12 75. Second, CEQA requires public agencies to avoid or reduce environmental damage when
13 "feasible" by requiring "environmentally superior" alternatives and all feasible mitigation measures. 14
14 § CCR § 15002(a)(2) and (3); Citizens of Goleta Valley, supra, 52, Cal.3d at 564. The EIR serves to
15 provide agencies and the public with information about the environmental impacts of a proposed project
16 and to "identify ways that environmental damage can be avoided or significantly reduced." 14 CCR §
17 15002(a)(2).

18 76. A lead agency may not approve a project if that project will have a significant effect on
19 the environment unless it has first adopted all feasible mitigation measures to eliminate or substantially
20 lessen all significant impacts of the project. PRC § 21002.1(a), (b); 21100(b)(3). In particular, CEQA
21 requires the lead agency to adopt feasible mitigation measures that will substantially lessen or avoid a
22 project's potentially significant environmental impacts (PRC §§ 21002, 21081(a)) and describe those
23 mitigation measures in the EIR. PRC § 21100(b)(3); 14 CCR § 15126.4. A public agency may not rely
24 on mitigation measures of uncertain efficacy or feasibility. Kings County Farm Bureau v. City of
25 Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 727.
26 77. CEQA also disallows approval of a project that fails to comply with other laws. A lead
27 agency may not approve a project with significant unavoidable impacts unless it is "otherwise
28 permissible under applicable laws and regulations." PRC §21002.1(c).

-15-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 78. If the project will have a significant effect on the environment, the agency may approve

2 the project only if it finds that it has "eliminated or substantially lessened all significant effects on the

3 environment where feasible" and that any unavoidable significant effects on the environment are

4 "acceptable due to overriding concerns." PRC § 21081; 14 CCR § 15092(b)(2)(A) & (B).

5 79. While the courts review an EIR using an "abuse of discretion" standard, "the reviewing

6 court is not to 'uncritically rely on every study or analysis presented by a project proponent in support of

7 its position. A 'clearly inadequate or unsupported study is entitled to no judicial deference.'" Berkeley

8 Jets, supra, 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1355, quoting Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n v. Regents of

0 University of Cal. (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 391 409, fn. 12. Drawing this line and determining whether the

10 EIR complies with CEQA's information disclosure requirements presents a question of law subject to
11 independent review by the courts. Sierra Club v. Cnty. of Fresno (2014) 226 Cal. App. 4th 704, 725;

12 Madera Oversight Coalition, Inc. v. County of Madera (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 48, 102, 131.

13 80. When challenging an agency's certification of an EIR under CEQA, abuse of discretion is

14 established if the agency: (1) has not proceeded in a manner required by law, or, (2) if the determination

15 Or decision is not supported by substantial evidence. PRC § 21168.5. Substantial evidence is defined as

16 "enough relevant information and reasonable inferences from this information that a fair argument can

17 be made to support a conclusion, even though other conclusions might also be reached." 14 CCR §

18 15384(a). Substantial evidence includes facts, reasonable assumptions predicated on facts, and expert

19 opinion supported by facts; however, it does not include argument, speculation, or unsubstantiated

20 opinion or narrative. PRC §§ 21080(e), 21082.2(c).

21 Recirculation of EIR

22 81. Recirculation of an EIR prior to certification, as here, is addressed in PRC § 21092.1, and

23 14 CCR $15088.5. "When significant new information is added to an environmental impact report after

24 notice has been given pursuant to Section 21092 ... but prior to certification, the public agency shall

25 give notice again pursuant to Section 21092, and consult again pursuant to Sections 21104 and 21153

26 before certifying the environmental impact report." PRC § 21092.1.

27 82. "Significant new information" includes:

28 (1) A new significant environmental impact would result from the project or from a new
-16-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

mitigation measure proposed to be implemented. (2) A substantial increase in the severity of an environmental impact would result... 2 (3) A feasible project alternative or mitigation measure considerably different from others
3 previously analyzed would clearly lessen the significant environmental impacts of the project.

4 (4) The draft EIR was so fundamentally and basically inadequate and conclusory in nature that meaningful public review and comment were precluded.
5 14 CCR §15088.5; Mountain Lion Coal. v. Fish and Game Comm'n (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1043 6 83. In Laurel Heights Impr. Assn. v. Reg. of Univ. of Cal. (1993) 6 Cal. 4th 1112 ("Laurel
7 Heights II'), the Supreme Court explained that Section 21092 favors EIR recirculation prior to
8 certification. The Court stated:
9 Section 21092.1 was intended to encourage meaningful public comment. (See State Bar
10 Rep., supra, at p. 28.) Therefore, new information that demonstrates that an EIR commented upon by the public was so fundamentally and basically inadequate or
11 conclusory in nature that public comment was in effect meaningless triggers recirculation under section 21092.1. (See, Mountain Lion Coalition v. Fish & Game Com., supra, 214 12 Cal.App.3d 1043.)

13 Laurel Heights II, 6 Cal.4th at 1130 (emph. added).

14 Subsequent or Supplemental Environmental Review

15 84. A subsequent or supplemental EIR is required prior to certification and approval of a

16 Project when 1) "[s]ubstantial changes are proposed in the project,' 2) "[s]ubstantial changes occur with

17 respect to the circumstances under which the project is being undertaken" or when "[n]ew information,

18 which was not known and could not have known at the time the environmental impact report was

19 certified as complete, becomes available.' PRC $ 21166.

20 85. Changes or modifications to a project, or changes to the circumstances under which the

21 project is undertaken, require a subsequent or supplemental EIR when the changes may result in "new

22 significant environmental effect or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified

23 significant effects." 14 CCR § 15162(a)(1 - 2).

24 86. CEQA Guidelines section 15162 further elucidates the situations in which a subsequent

25 or supplemental EIR must be prepared:

26 (1) Substantial changes are proposed in the project which will require major revisions of
27 the previous EIR or negative declaration due to the involvement of new significant environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified 28 significant effects; (2) Substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which the project is
-17-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

L undertaken which will require major revisions of the previous EIR or negative declaration

2 due to the involvement of new significant environmental effects or a substantial increase
in the severity of previously identified significant effects; or

3 (3) New information of substantial importance, which was not known and could not have

4 been known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time the previous EIR was certified as complete or the negative declaration was adopted, shows any of the
following:
5 (A) The project will have one or more significant effects not discussed in the

6 previous EIR or negative declaration;

7 (B) Significant effects previously examined will be substantially more severe than
shown in the previous EIR;

8 (C) Mitigation measures or alternatives previously found not to be feasible would in fact be feasible and would substantially reduce one or more significant effects

9 of the project, but the project proponents decline to adopt the mitigation measure
or alternative; or

10 (D) Mitigation measures or alternatives which are considerably different from

11 those analyzed in the previous EIR would substantially reduce one or more
significant effects on the environment, but the project proponents decline to adopt

12 the mitigation measure or alternative.

13 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15162(a).

14 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

87.
15 This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, §§ 526

16 (injunctive relief), 1060 (declaratory relief), 1085 (traditional mandate) and 1094.5 (administrative

17 mandate), PRC §§ 21168 and 21168.5 (judicial review under CEQA), and Government Code, § 65009

18 (actions challenging local government decisions). The Court has jurisdiction to issue declaratory relief

19 § pursuant to CCP § 1060 and injunctive relief pursuant to CCP §§ 525 et seq.

88.
20 Venue is proper in this Court in the first instance, pursuant to CCP §§ 394 (actions

21 against a city, county or local agency), and 395 (actions generally), since both the Respondents and the

22 Project site are located in the County of Los Angeles. Respondents include a local agency of the State of
California.
23 89.
24 Venue is also proper in this Court because most Project activities will occur within the

25 County of Los Angeles, and the environmental impacts of the Project will be acutely felt within the

26 county. The cause alleged in this Petition, or some part of that cause, arise in this county. CCP § 393; §

27 Cal. State Parks Foundation v. Super. Ct. (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 826.

2 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES, INADEQUATE REMEDIES AT
LAW, AND JURISDICTION

3 90.

4 Petitioners have exhausted all available administrative remedies before Respondents in
objecting to the approval of the Project, as required by Public Resources Code section 21177.
91.

6 Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law, and thus seeks a writ of
mandate from this Court.

7 92.

8 Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

9 21167.5 by mailing prior written notice of commencement of this action to Respondents, a copy of
which is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

10 93.

11 Petitioners will comply with the requirements of Public Resources Code section 21167.7

12 by providing notice of this action and a copy of the original petition to the California Attorney General
within 10 days of the filing of this action.

13 94.

14 to prepare Petitioners hereby and by a separate election notifies Respondents that Petitioners elects

15 the record of the proceedings in compliance with Public Resources Code section

16 21167.6.(b)(2). A copy of such notice is filed concurrently with this Petition, and is attached hereto as
Exhibit B.

17 95.

18 Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, as well as

19 Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.9, this Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of

mandate.

20 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL

21 96.

22 This proceeding involves enforcement of important rights affecting the public interest.

23 Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a substantial benefit on the public, including

24 citizens, residents, businesses and taxpayers of Los Angeles County, and will result in the enforcement

25 of important public rights by requiring the County to comply with CEQA and other legal requirements

26 applicable to the proposed Project; by voiding the Project Approvals and prohibiting Respondents from

27 taking further actions with respect to the Project until it has complied with those legal requirements; and

28 by prohibiting the Respondents from undertaking any portion of the Project until the County has fully
complied with these legal requirements.

-19-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

97. Petitioner brings a this action as a private attorney general pursuant to CCP §1021.5. The
2 necessity and financial burden of enforcement of these public rights entitle Petitioner to an award of
3 reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to that section.
4 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
5 (By Petitioners For Writ of Administrative Mandate Under CCP § 1094.5 and PRC $211168 Or In The Alternative CCP § 1085 and PRC § 21168.5 Re: Violations of CEQA; RFEIR Does Not 6 Comply With CEQA. Against all Respondents, Real Parties in Interest and Defendants)
7 98. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate all of the above paragraphs as if fully set forth
8 herein.

9 99. CEQA requires the lead agency for a project to prepare an EIR that complies with the
10 requirements of the statute. The lead agency also must provide for public review and comment on the
11 project and associated environmental documentation. An EIR must provide an adequate project
12 description and sufficient environmental analysis such that decision-makers can intelligently consider
13 environmental consequences when acting on the proposed project.
14 100. Where, as here, the lead agency conducts subsequent CEQA review of a previously 15 approved Project, CEQA requires the agency to consider whether substantial changes are proposed in 16

17 the project, whether substantial changes have occur with respect to the circumstances under which the
project is being undertake, and whether new information, which was not known and could not have 18

19 known at the time the environmental impact report was certified as complete, has becomes available
which demonstrates that the 20 project may have new or more severed impacts, or require new mitigation

21 measures, than what was previously analyzed .

22 101. Respondents were at all times under a mandatory duty to comply with all requirements of

23 CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines. Respondents failed and refused to perform that duty.

24 102. Respondents modified and re-approved the Project despite the RFEIR's failure to

25 disclose that the modified Project would have new and significant environmental impacts that were not

26 discussed in the previous FEIR, and that the modified Project would result in a substantial increase in

27 the severity of previously identified significant effects.

28

-20-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

103. The RFEIR fails to address new information of substantial importance which was not
2 known and could not have been known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time the previous
3 FEIR was certified; fails to consider mitigation measures and alternatives that became available due to
4 the modified Project size which would substantially reduce one or more significant effects on the 5 environment; fails to address substantial changes made to the Project which requires major revisions of 6 the original FEIR; and fails to implement all feasible mitigation measures to reduce those significant 7 impacts to the extent feasible.
8
104.
9 As the result of these deficiencies, the RFEIR fails to perform its function as an

10 informational document that is meant "to provide public agencies and the public in general with detailed

11 information about the effect which a proposed project is likely to have on the environment" and "to list

12 ways in which the significant effects of such a project might be minimized." Laurel Heights I,47 I.

13 Cal.3d 376 at 391.

14 105. CEQA requires the Court to establish whether an agency abused its discretion by

15 determining whether an agency failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and/or whether the

16 agency's decision is not supported by substantial evidence. PRC § 21168.

17 106. Based on these legal standards, Respondents abused their discretion, exceeded their
18 jurisdiction a and proceeded in a manner contrary to law without the support of substantial evidence in the
19 record by certifying a legally deficient RFEIR for the Project that failed to adequately analyze and
20 mitigate for the Project's environmental impacts, including but not limited to, in the following ways:
21 a. Failing to adequately analyze and mitigate the Project's impact on air quality in
22 light of modifications that the RFEIR made to Mitigation Measure Air Quality 1,
23 which requires that the Project utilize Mode-Year 2010 trucks or later.
24 b. Failing to adequately analyze and mitigate the Project's impact on air quality in 25 light of new information which demonstrates that 2010 Model Year trucks
26 produce NOx emissions that are substantially higher than disclosed by the District 27
or analyzed in the original FEIR. 28

C.

2 Failing to adequately analyze and mitigate the new and more severe impacts
caused by modifications to Mitigation Measures Biological Resources 6 and 8,

D which added adaptive management measures, including corrective regrading, soil

4 amendments, new plantings, closing trails and installing barriers. As approved in

6 the RFEIR, Mitigation Measures Biological Resources 6 and 8 will result in new

7 d. and significant, unmitigated impacts on biological and recreational resources.

8 Improperly deferring the development of mitigation measures. The RFEIR

9 improperly defers critical details regarding a number of the Project's mitigation

10 measures, including but not limited to the development of site-specific Habitat

E Restoration Plan and performance standards.

12 e. Failure to adequately respond to public comments. The RFEIR fails to adequately

13 respond to a number of substantive issues raised by members of the public during

14 the DEIR comment period, including but not limited to, new and more severe

15

16 environmental impacts that would be caused by the Project's revised air quality
and biological mitigation measures.

17 f.

18 Failure to perform subsequent or supplemental environmental review. The Flood

19 Control District was required to perform subsequent or supplemental

20 environmental review because of substantial changes to the Project, circumstances

21 and new information since the original FEIR certification in 2014, including but

22 not limited to, the following ways:

1.

23 Making substantial changes to the Project, including changing the amount

24 of sediment planned to be removed and making substantial changes to

25 mitigation measures for the Project that will likely have their own

26 environmental impacts, including trail closures.
