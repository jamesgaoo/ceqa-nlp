P

2 Petitioner and Plaintiff Save Our Glendale (*Petitioner") alleges as follows:

INTRODUCTION

3 1.

4 This action challenges the decisions by Respondents City of Glendale ("City"), Glendale

5 City Council ("City Council"), and Glendale Community Development Department ("Development

6 Department" or collectively with City and City Council as "Respondents") in connection with approvals

7 a for a project known as the South Glendale Community Plan ("SGCP" or "Project").

2.

8 The SGCP consists of substantial and significant amendments to the policies of the

9 existing South Glendale Community Plan, including zone changes and height district changes, as well as
amendments to the City's General Plan.

10 3.

11 The SGCP covers an area totaling 2,952 acres with a population of over 100,000 people,

12 including all of the neighborhoods within Glendale south of SR-134, including Downtown Glendale,

13 Adams Hill, and Tropico. SGCP area is generally bounded by Chevy Chase Drive and Acacia Avenue

14 to the north, Verdugo Road and city of Los Angeles to the east, the Adams Hill Neighborhood (bordered

15 by Glendale Avenue to the west), and the city of Los Angeles to the south.

4. Petitioner challenges Respondents' actions on July 31, 2018 in certifying the
16 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for SGCP, as well as adopting the Statement of Overriding
17 Considerations, approving the Resolution Adopting the Tropico Center Plan (part of SGCP's Alternative

18

19 2) as amended, adopting the Motion Initiating Preparation of TOD Zone for the Tropico TOD Center,

20 adopting a Motion Directing Staff to Modify the Land Use Element Text and Map Amendments to

21 Match South Glendale Community Plan Modifications, adopting the Resolution to Amend Land Use

22 Element Map Related to the Six C3 III Parcels - PGPA 1900448, and Introduction of Ordinance to

23 Amend Zoning Map Related to the Six C3 III Parcels - PZC 1800449. All of these actions will allow

24 Respondents to initiate zone changes and density increases in the Tropico Center (part of SGCP's

25 Alternative 2) and in the entire South Glendale area. Moreover, as stated in Respondents' Resolution

26 dated July 31, 2018: "The proposed new zones could be applied elsewhere in Glendale through future

27 legislative actions, but are only proposed to be applied to South Glendale at the present time through the
adoption of the proposed project."

28 5. Petitioner alleges that Respondents' actions violate provisions of the California

3 Municipal Code §§ 30.63.070 - 080, State Planning and Zoning Law, Cal. Govt. Code 8 65000 et seq.

4 a Petitioner seeks a writ of mandate, inter alia, invalidating and setting aside Respondents' above-
described approvals and EIR certification.

5 PARTIES

6 6.

7 Petitioner SAVE OUR GLENDALE is a California unincorporated nonprofit association

8 ("SOG"). Its members include residents and residential property owners in the City of Glendale who

9 advocate for residential quality of life, health and safety in Glendale and who would be negatively

10 affected by the Project. SOG members have submitted written and oral comments to Respondents
opposing the Project.

11 7.

12 Defendant and Respondent City is a California charter city located in the County of Los

13 Angeles, California. The Project is within the jurisdictional limits of the City.

8.

14 Defendant and Respondent City Council is the elected governing body of the City and is

15 the body responsible for the decisions being challenged herein, as well as for promulgating municipal

16 ordinances, resolutions, and policies. The City Council is the lead agency responsible under CEQA for
evaluating the environmental impacts of the SGCP.

17 9.

18 Defendant and Respondent Development Department is an agency of the City responsible

19 for developing, applying and enforcing state and local land-use and zoning laws within the jurisdictional

20 limits of the City and acted as the lead agency for the Project.
10.

21 Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of respondents sued herein as

22 DOES through 20, inclusive, and real parties in interest sued herein as ROES 1 through 20, inclusive,

23 and therefore sues said respondents and real parties in interest by those fictitious names. Petitioner will

24 amend this Petition to allege their true names and capacities when the same have been ascertained.

25 Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that each of these fictitiously named

26 respondents is in some manner responsible for the wrongful conduct alleged in this petition. Petitioner

27 IS informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that these fictitiously named respondents were, at

28 all times mentioned in this petition, the agents, servants, and employees of their co-respondents and
were acting within their authority as such with the consent and permission of their co-respondents.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2 11. Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) §§ 1094.5 and 1085 and Public

3 Resources Code (PRC) §§ 21168, 21168.5 and 21168.9, this Court has jurisdiction to issue writ of

4 mandate to set aside Respondents' decision to certify the Project's environmental impact report and

5 purported approval of the Project.

6 12. Venue is proper in this Court because the Project lies entirely within the County of Los

7 Angeles and the environmental impacts of the Project will be acutely felt in this County. The cause

8 alleged in this Petition, or some part of that cause, arise in this county. (CCP § 393; Cal. State Parks

9 Foundation v. Super. Ct. (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 826.) Venue is also proper in this Court pursuant to

10 CCP Sections §§ 394 (actions against a city, county or local agency) and 395 (actions generally), since

11 the City of Glendale is in the County of Los Angeles.

12 13. This petition is timely filed within 30 days after Respondent's decision to issue a Notice a
13 of Determination in accordance with PRC § 21167(a).

14 14. Petitioner provided written notice to Respondents of its intention to file the petition in

15 compliance with PRC § 21167.5. The notice and proof of service are attached hereto as Exhibit A.

16 15. Petitioner has caused a copy of this pleading to be served on the Attorney General not

17 more than ten days after the commencement of this proceeding, as required by PRC § 21167.7 and CCP

18 uo. 388. A true and correct copy of the notice is attached to this pleading as Exhibit B.

19 16. Petitioner has filed a request for hearing in compliance with PRC § 21167.4, a true and

20 correct copy of which request is attached hereto as Exhibit C.

21 17. Petitioner has elected to prepare the record of proceedings in this matter pursuant to PRC

22 21167.6(b)(2) and has filed notice of its intent to prepare said record of proceedings. A true and

23 correct copy of the notice is attached to this pleading as Exhibit D.
24 18. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this instant action and

25 has exhausted administrative remedies to the extent required by law under PRC § 21177. Petitioner

26 and/or other agencies and individuals raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this petition orally

27 or in writing during the Respondents' decision-making process.

P 19.

2 The violations by Respondents as alleged herein have affected the beneficial interests of

3 Petitioner and/or their supporting members. The relief sought by way of this petition will redress this

4 beneficial interest and the likelihood of future injury and interference with Petitioner's interests and
those of its supporting members.

5 20.

6 Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law unless

7 this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside their certification of

8 the environmental documents and the adoption of the Project. In the absence of such remedies,

9 Respondents' decisions will remain in effect in violation of state law and injurious to Petitioner.
STATUTORY FRAMEWORK

10 California Environmental Quality Act

11 21.

12 Passed in 1970 as a state counterpart to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA),

13 the California Environmental Quality Act, Cal. PRC § 21000 ("CEQA") requires state and local

14 agencies to identify the potentially significant environmental impacts of their actions, and then to avoid
or mitigate those impacts if feasible.

15 22.

16 CEQA requires that an agency analyze the potential environmental impacts of its

17 proposed actions in an environmental impact report (except in certain limited circumstances). See, e.g.,

18 PRC § 21100, et seq. The EIR is the very heart of CEQA. Dunn-Edwards v. BAAQMD (1992) 9

19 Cal.App.4th 644, 652. "The 'foremost principle' in interpreting CEQA is that the Legislature intended

20 the act to be read so as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable

21 scope of the statutory language." Cmtys. for a Better Env't v. Cal. Resources Agency (2002) 103
Cal.App.4th 98, 109.

22 23.

23 CEQA has two primary purposes. First, CEQA is designed to inform decision makers

24 and the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of a project. 14 Cal. Code Reg.

25 ("CCR") § 15002(a)(1). "Its purpose is to inform the public and its responsible officials of the

26 environmental consequences of their decisions before they are made. Thus, the EIR 'protects not only

27 the environment but also informed self-government.™ Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of Supervisors

28 (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564. The EIR has been described as "an environmental 'alarm bell' whose
purpose it is to alert the public and its responsible officials to environmental changes before they have

-5-

-

2 reached ecological points of no return." Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay v. Bd. of Port Comrs. (2001)
91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1354.

3 24.

4 Second, CEQA requires public agencies to avoid or reduce environmental damage when

5 "feasible" by requiring "environmentally superior" alternatives and all feasible mitigation measures. 14

6 CCR § 15002(a)(2) and (3); Citizens of Goleta Valley, supra, 52 Cal.3d at 564. The EIR serves to

7 provide agencies and the public with information about the environmental impacts of a proposed project

8 and to "identify ways that environmental damage can be avoided or significantly reduced." 14 CCR
15002(a)(2).

9 25.

10 The required CEQA environmental review involves both substantive and procedural

11 steps. Public participation plays an important and protected role in the CEQA process. Laurel Heights

12 Improvement Association V. Regents of the University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392 ("The

13 EIR process protects not only the environment but also informed self government."); Concerned

14 Citizens of Costa Mesa, Inc. v. 32nd District Agricultural Association (1986) 42 Cal.3d 929, 936

15 (members of the public have a "privileged position" in the CEQA process). "Each public agency should

16 include provisions in its CEQA procedures for wide public involvement, formal and informal, consistent
with its existing activities and procedures, in order to receive and evaluate public reactions to
17 environmental issues related to the agency's activities." 14 CCR § 15201. The lead agency must

18

19 consider all "comments it receives on a draft environmental impact report, proposed negative

20 I declaration, or proposed mitigated declaration." PRC § 21091(d)(1); 14 CCR § 15074(b).

26.

21 Furthermore, "where comments from responsible experts or sister agencies disclose new

22 or conflicting data or opinions that cause concern that the agency may not have fully evaluated the

23 project and its alternatives, these comments may not simply be ignored. There must be good faith,

24 reasoned analysis in response.'" People v. County of Kern (1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 830, 841-842, 115

25 Cal.Rptr. 67; accord, Concerned Citizens of Costa Mesa, Inc. v. 32nd Dist. Agricultural Assn. (1986) 42

26 Cal.3d 929, 935, 231 Cal.Rptr. 748, 727 P.2d 1029. Rather than sweep disagreements under the rug, the

27 City must fairly present them in its EIR. It is then free to explain why it declined to accept commission

28 staff suggestions." Banning Ranch Conservancy v. City of Newport Beach (2017) 2 Cal.5th 918, 940-
941. "The full consideration of environmental effects CEQA mandates must not be reduced 66 'to a

-6-

-

2 process whose result will be largely to generate paper, to produce an EIR that describes a journey whose

3 destination is already predetermined.' Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. V. City of Los Angeles

4 (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 268, 271, 126 Cal.Rptr.2d 615)." Save Tara V. City of West Hollywood (2008)
45 Cal.4th 116, 135-136.

5 27.

6 Procedurally, a lead agency may not approve a project until the public has been given a

7 full and adequate opportunity to participate and comment on the project.

28.

8 "When assessing the legal sufficiency of an environmental impact report, the reviewing

9 court focuses on adequacy, completeness and good faith effort at full disclosure." San Joaquin Raptor

10 Rescue Center v. County of Merced (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 645, 653.

29.

11 CEQA also disallows approval of a project that fails to comply with other laws. A lead

12 agency may not approve a project with significant unavoidable impacts unless it is "otherwise

13 permissible under applicable laws and regulations." PRC § 21002.1(c).

30.

14 An action alleging that a public agency is "carrying out or has approved a project that

15 may have a significant effect on the environment" without having followed CEQA procedures with a

16 legitimate approval of the project must be commenced within "180 days from the date of the public

17 agency's decision to carry out or approve the project, or, if a project is undertaken without a formal

18 decision by the public agency, within 180 days from the date of commencement of the project." PRC §
21167(a).

19 State Planning and Zoning Law

20 31.

21 The State Planning and Zoning Law, Cal. Government Code § § 65000 et seq (*State

22 Planning and Zoning Law") governs the land use planning process for city, county and local government
agencies within the State of California.

23 32.

24 The State Planning and Zoning Law mandates that cities and counties prepare a general

25 plan to govern the long term, physical development of the land under city and county jurisdiction. Cal.
Govt. Code § 65300.

26 33.

27 The General Plan is required to be internally consistent to be able to lay out the plan and

28 vision for the long-term physical development of the land. Cal. Govt. Code co 65300.5. "[T]he general
plan is required to be consistent within itself." Sierra Club v. Kern County Board of Supervisors (1981)

2 Glendale Municipal Code

3 34.

4 Glendale Municipal Code § 30.63.070 requires that the amendments to the City's Generall

5 Plan first receive a written recommendation from the City's Planning Commission before being

6 approved by the City Council. Further, under Glendale Municipal Code, the Planning Commission shall

7 hold a public hearing and consider all evidence presented for and against the proposal for General Plan

8 amendment and shall consider all arguments pertinent thereto. The planning commission shall make a

9 written recommendation on the adoption or amendment of a General Plan.

35.

10 Glendale Municipal Code § 30.63.080 provides that if the City Council makes any

11 substantial modifications to the General Plan amendments that were not previously considered by the

12 City's Planning Commission, that the substantial modifications will be remanded back to the City's
Planning Commission for its recommendation.

13 Due Process and Good Faith at Disclosure

14 36.

15 Petitioner's and other interested persons' constitutional due process and fair hearing

16 rights are violated when the lead agency fails to disclose pertinent information in good faith. An agency

17 preparing an EIR should make a good faith effort to find out and disclose all that it reasonably can. 14

18 Cal. Code Regs 15144, 15151; Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth v. City of Rancho

19 Cordova (2007) 40 CA4th412, 428; Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay Comm. V. Board of Port Comm'rs

20 (2001) 91 CA4th 1344; Citizens to Preserve the Ojai v. County of Ventura (1985) 176 CA3d421, 431.

21 An agency is not acting in good faith when "it gives conflicting signals to decision makers and the

22 public about the nature and scope of the activity being proposed." San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Center v.

23 County of Merced (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 645, 655-656.

37.

24 California Constitution guarantees the public's right of access: "The people have the right

25 of access to information concerning the conduct of the people's business, and, therefore, the meetings of

26 public bodies and the writings of public officials and agencies shall be open to public scrutiny." Cal.

27 Const., Art. I, Sect. 3(b)(1). Therefore, a public agency violates due process and fails to act in good

28 faith when it arbitrarily and capriciously withholds information from the public forcing the public to
pursue Public Records Act requests and to further request to augment the administrative record.

PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL

2 38. This proceeding involves enforcement of important rights affecting the public interest.

3 Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition a will confer a substantial benefit on the public, including

4 citizens, residents, businesses and taxpayers of the City, and will result in the enforcement of important

5 public rights by requiring Respondents to comply with CEQA and other legal requirements applicable to

6 the proposed Project; by voiding the Project approvals and the EIR certification, and prohibiting

7 Respondents from taking further actions with respect to the Project (or its EIR) until it has complied

8 with those legal requirements; and by prohibiting Respondents from using the EIR or undertaking any

9 portion of the Project until they have fully complied with these legal requirements

10 39. Petitioner is entitled to recover attorneys' fees as provided in CCP § 1021.5 if it prevails

11 In this action. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement of these public rights entitle Petitioner

12 to an award of reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to that section.

13 STATEMENT OF FACTS

14 40. The City determined that an EIR was required without the preparation of an Initial Study

15 and prepared a Notice of Preparation on September 7, 2016. The State Clearinghouse assigned this

16 Project State Clearinghouse (SCH) No. 2016091026. The Notice of Preparation circulated for public

17 review and comment for a 30-day period beginning on September 7, 2016.

18 41. Unlike the development of the North Glendale Community Plan and its EIR, where

19 members of the public and interested groups were included in the process, members of the public were

20 specifically excluded from the team working on the SGCP and its EIR despite public's requests.

21 42. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that Respondents failed to

22 consult all responsible agencies as required under CEQA.

23 43. The Draft Environmental Impact Report ("Draft EIR") was circulated for a 60-day public
24 comment period between January 11, 2018 to March 12, 2018.

25 44. The SGCP presented various alternatives, all of which - except for the "No Project"

26 alternative - exceeded the population growth projected by the Southern California Government

27 Association of Governments (SCAG) by about 3-4 times. Further, the SGCP's EIR provided that the

28 actual population growth may exceed the projections in the EIR upon full buildout of the Project.

-9-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

H 45.

2 The Draft EIR identified seven adverse environmental impacts for which no feasible

3 mitigation measures were found. Those included: aesthetics/shading, air quality and air pollution,

4 greenhouse gas emissions, population and housing, open space and recreation, public services,
transportation and traffic.

5 46.

6 On March 7, 2018 the Development Department presented the SGCP to the City of

7 Glendale Planning Commission, to take testimony concerning the Draft EIR and the SGCP, including

8 amendments to the General Plan. The City's Planning Commission and the public recommended

9 numerous revisions in the Draft EIR and noted critical omissions (e.g., open space, provisions for
schools and public services).

10 47. On March 13, 2018 the City Council proposed a Moratorium to halt residential
11 developments in the Downtown Specific Plan ("DSP") area, in view of the recent developments

12

13 exceeding the number of dwelling units studied in the DSP's EIR. In view of the health and safety

14 concerns associated with the exceeding density in the DSP, on March 27, 2018 the City Council voted

to

15 approve the Moratorium and to initiate studies of and revisions to the DSP development policies to

16 address the mentioned concerns. On May 8, 2018 the Moratorium, which was initially adopted for 45
days, was extended for another 10 months and 15 days.

17 48. The DSP area is covered by the SGCP.

18 49.

19 Presently, the City staff is tasked with studying and examining the potential physicial,

20 social and environmental impacts of developments in the DSP, and recommending new or amended

21 policies, zoning or development standards, incentives, affordable housing requirements or impact fees

22 with respect to the DSP for consideration by City Council. The City staff will also specifically analyze

23 and address floor area ratios versus densities, guidelines for ground floor treatment, open space criteria,

24 landscaping standards, and the open space incentive.
50. On June 25, 2018 the Development Department presented the SGCP and its Final
25 Environmental Impact Report (Final EIR) at a special meeting of the Planning Commision, along with

26

27 the General Plan amendments, for review and comment. The Development Department did not provide

28 any reasons for the proposed amendments to the General Plan other than the reason to make the SGCP
consistent with the City's General Plan; however, at least in part, the amendments were unrelated to the

-10-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

-

2 SGCP. The Planning Commission raised numerous concerns about the SGCP and recommended

3 amendments to the SGCP. The Planning Commission asked the Development Department to schedule

4 additional meetings to discuss the recommended changes before voting on the SGCP and its EIR.

5 However, the Development Department insisted on Planning Commission's vote in view of the time

6 constraints (expiring $500,000 Metro grant ) and inability to hold an additional meeting before the City

7 Council's scheduled vote on the Project. Being assured that its recommended changes to the Project

8 will be incorporated into the SGCP, the Planning Commission agreed to vote only on the Tropico Center

9 Plan -part of the Alternative 2 of the SGCP. Making sure that its vote would apply to the Tropico

10 Center Plan only, the Planning Commission unanimously voted on all the motions, including the

11 proposed amendments to the General Plan. The Planning Commission's vote on June 25, 2018

12 proceeded without the full reading of the motions' text. After the vote, the Planning Commission

13 requested the Development Department to prepare the text of the motions it voted on to verify that its

14 recommended changes were included in the final text of the approved motions. After reviewing the text

15 of the prepared motions, the Planning Commission members noted that their recommended changes to

16 the SGCP were not reflected in the text of the approved motions and once again asked the Development

17 Department to confirm that that their vote applied only to the Tropico Center Plan. The Development

18 Department reassured that the Planning Commission's vote applied to the Tropico Center Plan only.

51.

19 Neither the Draft EIR nor the Final EIR has provided a separate project description and
impacts of the Tropico Center Plan in the SGCP (e.g., the number of units to be added or the number of
20 population growth expected). Tropico Center Plan has always been part of the Alternative 2 of the

21

22 SGCP, together with the other part of the Downtown Development presently under study and subject to

23 the Moratorium. The total growth of units for the Alternative 2 - for both the Tropico Center Plan and

24 Downtown Development - was estimated in the EIR and under the SGCP to be 5,400-7,400.

52.

25 On July 3 and July 17, 2018, Petitioner sought public records under California Public

26 Records Act on the SGCP; Petitioner's both requests were arbitrarily denied by Respondents.

53.

27 On July 31, 2018 the City Council conducted a hearing on the SGCP. The Development

28 Department presented the SGCP as the Tropico Center Plan, but without any increase of density, zone
changes, and General Plan amendments. Being assured by the Development Department that the Project

-11-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

P

2 as approved would not include any density increases or zone changes, the City Council voted and

3 approved all the motions: certified the EIR, adopted the Statement of Overriding Considerations,

4 approved the Tropico Center Plan for the SGCP (with recommendation to study the Plan further for

5 future approvals), approved the recommendations for General Plan amendment, and all the respective

6 motions. The City Council's vote proceeded without the reading of the text of the motions or
resolutions prior to the vote.

7 54.

8 On all hearings of March 7, May 25, and July 31, 2018 the Development Department

9 verbally assured that the Project will be implemented only after the transit is in place. No such written
assurances are found in the SGCP or its EIR.

10 55.

11 On August 7, 2018 the City filed the Notice of Determination ("NOD") regarding the

12 Respondents' mentioned approvals. The NOD included both the approval of the SGCP (Tropico Center

13 Plan), initiation of zone changes, and amendments to the General Plan.

14 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (Violations of CEQA and CEQA Guidelines; EIR Does Not Comply With CEQA)

56.

16 Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates by reference all of the above paragraphs as if
fully set forth herein.

17 57.

18 CEQA requires the lead agency for a project to prepare an EIR that complies with the

19 requirements of the statute. The lead agency also must provide for public review and comment on the

20 project and associated environmental documentation. An EIR must provide an adequate project

21 description and sufficient environmental analysis such that decision-makers can intelligently consider

22 environmental consequences when acting on the proposed projects.

58.

23 Respondents' action in certifying the EIR of the SGCP is a prejudicial abuse of discretion

24 in that Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law and failed to support their decision
by substantial evidence. Among other things, the City:

25 a.

26 Adopted improper Project objectives. The EIR does not adequately analyze an

27 adequate range of project objectives. Failed to set the proper objectives for the

28 EIR of a community plan; i.e., to accommodate the reasonably projected natural

-12-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

-

2 growth of the population and to ensure there is adequate infrastructure to support
such growth;
W b.

40o † Failed to provide an adequate project description. The EIR project description is
inadequate as it omits a number of critical details and fails to provide a stable and
finite project description, among other things allowing for the use of flexible
zoning;

7 C.

8 Failed to adequately disclose and analyze the SGCP's environmental setting and

9 baseline. Specifically, instead of choosing the population number as a baseline

10 for the community plan, the City improperly chose the number of dwelling units

11 as the baseline. Moreover, the chosen baseline of the natural growth of dwelling

12 units without the Project (2,587 units in the next 22 years before 2040) was

13 clearly inaccurate in view of the actual increase of dwelling units in South

14 Glendale in the past 12 years (over 6,000 units) and the number of present

15 numerous development project applications in South Glendale;

d.

16 Failed to adequately disclose or analyze the Project's individual significant

17 impacts on the environment, including but not limited to the Project's individual

18 impacts with respect to aesthetics, air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, land use

19 and planning, transportation and traffic, public utilities and services, public safety,

20 open space, hydrology and water quality, utilities and infrastructure, noise, and
cumulative impacts;

21 e.

22 Failed to adequately disclose or analyze the Project's cumulative impacts from,

23 among other things, all currently proposed projects, approved projects and

24 approved projects yet to be built with the proposed zone changes and increases in
density under the SGCP;

25 f.

26 Improperly deferred and provided unenforceable mitigation measures. The EIR

27 adopts unenforceable mitigation measures which defer critical details regarding a

28 number of the Project's mitigation measures, including mitigation measures 4.2-3
which merely calls for the City to "minimize exposure of new sensitive receptors

-13-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

-

2 to toxic air contaminants (TACs) and fine particulate matter, to the extent possible

w and consider distance, orientation, and wind direction when siting sensitive land

40o † uses in proximity to TAC- and PM2.5 emitting sources in order to minimize
exposure to health risk";

g. Failed to consider a reasonable range of alternatives by, among other things,

7 failing to consider alternatives that would only accommodate the reasonably

8 projected population growth for the area; and

h.

9 Failed to recirculate the EIR after the addition of significant new information to

10 the EIR after public notice was given of the availability of the Draft EIR for

11 public review, but prior to certification.

59.

12 PRC § 21080.4 specifically requires the lead agency to consult all responsible agencies

13 prior to preparing the Draft EIR, and the legislative history of the statute makes clear that the purpose of

14 such consultation is to ensure that responsible agencies can impose certain mitigation measures and

15 require those to be included in the final EIR. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon

16 alleges, that Respondents failed to consult all responsible agencies (e.g., fire department, police

17 department, etc.) as required under CEQA and PRC, despite the fact that the SGCP's EIR identified

18 seven adverse environmental impacts (including impact on public services).

60.

19 CEQA requires every lead agency to provide a good faith, reasoned analysis in response

20 to comments received on an EIR, to address recommendations and objections in detail, and to explain

21 why specific comments and suggestions, especially those of experts, were not accepted. The EIR fails
to respond adequately to comments on the EIR, including comments from Respondent's experts and
22 commissioners (e.g., comments regarding SGCP's failure to meet project objectives, environmental

23

24 setting and baseline, air quality, transportation, public safety, cumulative impacts, and the failure to
disclose or analyze a reasonable range of alternatives).

25 61.

26 CEQA also requires to not knowingly release a deficient document hoping that the public

27 will correct the mistakes. The EIR for the SGCP is incomplete, inaccurate, inadequate and misleading.

28

-14-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

P 62.

2 As a result of Respondents' violations of CEQA, Petitioner has been harmed in that

3 Petitioner and other members of the public were not fully informed about the significant environmental

4 impacts of the SGCP prior to Respondents' approval of the SGCP and certification of its EIR.

63.

5 As a result of the foregoing defects and others according to proof, Respondents

6 prejudicially abused their discretion by certifying an EIR that does not comply with CEQA and by

7 approving the Project in reliance thereon. Accordingly, Respondents' certification of the Final EIR and
purported approval of the Project must be set aside.

8

9 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

10 (Violations of CEQA; Failure to Substantially Support Factual Findings and Overriding
Considerations)

11 64.

12 Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates by reference all of the above paragraphs as if
fully set forth herein.

13 65.

14 CEQA requires that a lead agency's findings for the approval of a project be supported by

15 substantial evidence in the administrative record. CEQA further requires a that a lead agency provide an

16 explanation of how evidence in the record supports the conclusions it has reached.

66. Respondents violated CEQA by adopting findings and the Statement of Overriding
17 Considerations that are inadequate as a matter of law as they are not supported by substantial evidence

18 in the record, including but not limited to the following:

19 a.

20 The determinations that certain environmental impacts would be less than

21 significant or that adopted mitigation measures would avoid or lessen the

22 Project's significant effects on the environment;

b.

23 The determinations that alternatives to the Project and proposed mitigation

24 measures that would have avoided or lessened the significant impacts of the

25 Project were infeasible, including but not limited to the No-Project alternative and

26 the other alternatives examined in the EIR;

C.

27 The determinations that other environmental impacts were significant and

28 unavoidable and had been mitigated to the extent feasible;

-15-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

P d.

2 The determination that some environmental impacts which had been identified as

W significant and unavoidable in both the Draft and Final EIRs are in fact less than
significant;
† ü e. The determination that overriding economic, legal, social technological, or other

6 f. benefits of the Project outweighed its significant impacts on the environment; and

7 Failure to explain how the No Project Alternative would not achieve the same

8 67. economic, legal, social, technological, or other benefits intended by the Project.

9 As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by

10 making determinations or adopting findings and a Statement of Overriding Considerations that do not

11 comply with the requirements of CEQA and approving the Project in reliance thereon. Accordingly,

12 Respondents' certification of the Final EIR and purported approval of the Project must be set aside.
THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

13

14 68. (Violations of CEQA; Facially Invalid Notice of Determination)

15 forth herein. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates all of the above paragraphs as if fully set

16 69.

17 Section 15094 of the CEOA Guidelines expressly states that a lead agency "shall file a

18 Notice of Determination after deciding to carry out or approve the project." An agency has not

19 "approved" a project under CEQA until it makes a "decision . .. which commits the agency to a definite

20 course of action in regard to a project to be carried out..." 14 CCR § 15352; see Coalition for Clean Air

21 v. City of Visalia (2012) 209 Cal. App. 4th 408, 423 ("[T]his mandatory language plainly means that a

22 notice of exemption filed before project approval does not comply with Guidelines section 15062.").

70.

23 The City Council's July 31, 2018 Project approval included directions to continue

24 modifying the SGCP to rewrite substantial portions of the various centers and corridors where mixed

25 uses are proposed to maintain current zoning densities, revise mixed land use designations, and modify

26 Road's End Neighborhood to designate the area zoned R1R as Single Family Hillside Residential, none

27 of which were studied in the Project's EIR or presented before either the Planning Commission or the
City Council.

28

-16-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

71. These modifications to the SGCP were not studied in the Project's EIR and did not

2 commit the City to a definite course of action with regards to the SGCP.

3 72. a As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by

4 approving the Project and issuing a Notice of Determination that fails to comply with the requirements

5 of CEQA. Accordingly, Respondents' certification of the EIR and Project approvals must be set aside.

6 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

7 (Violation of Glendale Municipal Code)

8 73. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates by reference all of the above paragraphs as if

9 fully set forth herein.

10 74. Glendale Municipal Code § 30.63.070 requires that the amendments to the City's Generall

11 Plan first receive a written recommendation from the City's Planning Commission before being

12 approved by the City Council. Further, under Glendale Municipal Code, the Planning Commission shall

13 hold a public hearing and consider all evidence presented for and against the proposal for General Plan

14 amendment and shall consider all arguments pertinent thereto. The Planning Commission shall make a

15 written recommendation on the adoption or amendment of a General Plan.

16 75. Glendale Municipal Code § 30.63.080 provides that if the City Council makes any

17 substantial modifications to the General Plan amendments that were not previously considered by the

18 City's Planning Commission, that the substantial modifications will be remanded back to the City's

19 Planning Commission for its recommendation.

20 76. In view of the Planning Commission's marked insistence and the Planning Department's

21 repeated confirmations that the Planning Commission's approvals on June 25, 2018 applied only to the

22 Tropico Center Plan, the Planning Commission never made an affirmative recommendation for the

23 amendments to the General Plan. Moreover, the General Plan amendments and its various elements

24 were not duly presented to the Planning Commission by the Planning Department beyond briefly

25 suggesting that those amendments were required only to make the SGCP consistent with the General

26 Plan.

27 77. The City Council's July 31, 2018 approval of the Project made substantial modifications

28 to the Project that were not previously considered by the City's Planning Commission, including

-17-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

P

2 breaking out individual elements proposed for modification in the SGCP, studying a mixed use

3 alternative that makes no changes to existing density and requiring the City to only update the Land Use

4 Element of the City's General Plan rather than both the Land Use Element and Circulation Element at

the same time.

5 78.

6 The City violated its own municipal code by failing to duly obtain a recommendation

7 from the City's Planning Commission for both the amendments to the General Plan and the changes
later made by the City Council.

8 79.

9 As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by

10 making substantial modifications to the Project that were not previously considered by the City's

11 Planning Commission and the approval of the Project must be set aside.

FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

12

13 (Violation of State Planning and Zoning Law; General Plan Internal Consistency)

80.

14 Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates by reference all of the above paragraphs as if
fully set forth herein.

15 81.

16 As required by state law, the City has a General Plan that governs land use planning

17 throughout the City. The general plan is a comprehensive declaration of goals, objectives, policies and

18 programs for the development of the City. A general plan is often called a "constitution" for future

19 development to which all other land use decisions must conform. See Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board
of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal3d 553, 570.

20 82.

21 Under Cal. Govt. Code § 65300.5, the general plan must be internally consistent.

22 Moreover, "It is the policies which must be integrated, internally consistent and compatible, not the

23 maps which simply depict policies applied to specific land areas, not the data and statistics, and not even

24 the objectives within the various elements." Garat v. City of Riverside (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 259, 300
(emphasis in original).

25 83. The adoption and integration of the SGCP into the City's General Plan create internal
26  inconsistencies in the City's General Plan by, among other things, 1) failing to provide for adequate

27

28 public services in violation of the Safety Element to the City's General Plan, 2) failing to provide
adequate park space in violation of the City's Park and Recreation Element, 3) calling for more

-18-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

P

2 increases in density than the projected population growth in violation of the Land Use Element to the

3 City's General Plan, 4) eliminating protection for historical properties in violation of the Historic

4 Preservation Element to the City's General Plan, and 5) failing to provide for affordable housing in
violation of the Housing Element of the City's General Plan.

5 84.

6 As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by

7 adopting amendments to the General Plan that rendered the General Plan internally inconsistent.

8 Accordingly, Respondents' approval of the Project and certification of its EIR must be set aside.
SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

9 (Due Process)

10 85.

11 Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates by reference all of the above paragraphs as if
fully set forth herein.

12 86.

13 Petitioner's and other interested persons' constitutional due process and fair hearing

14 rights are violated when the public agency unreasonably fails to disclose pertinent information in good

15 faith. An agency preparing an EIR should make t good faith effort to find out and disclose all that it

16 reasonably can. 14 Cal. Code Regs 15144, 15151; Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth v.

17 City of Rancho Cordova (2007) 40 CA4th412, 428; Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay Comm. v. Board of

18 Port Comm'rs (2001) 91 CA4th 1344; Citizens to Preserve the Ojai v. County of Ventura (1985) 176

19 CA3d421, 431. An agency is not acting in good faith when "it gives conflicting signals to decision

20 makers and the public about the nature and scope of the activity being proposed." San Joaquin Raptor

21 Rescue Center v. County of Merced (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 645, 655-656.

87.

22 Furthermore, California Constitution guarantees the public's right of access: "The people

23 have the right of access to information concerning the conduct of the people's business, and, therefore,

24 the meetings of public bodies and the writings of public officials and agencies shall be open to public

25 scrutiny." Cal. Const., Art. I, Sect. 3(b)(1). The public agency fails to act in good faith when it

26 arbitrarily and capriciously withholds information from the requesting public forcing the public to
pursue public records act requests and further to

27 request to augment

88. the administrative record.

28 Throughout the entire process, during the Draft EIR presentations, Final EIR
presentations, and the final hearing on the SGCP and its EIR, the Development Department provided

-19-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

P

2 the public and the decision-makers an incomplete, inaccurate, misleading and inconsistent information

3 about the Project, proposed approvals, and the implications thereof.

89.

4 a As a result, the public, the City's Planning Commission and City Council were

5 misinformed by the Development Department on what the Project is and what is the significance of their
approvals or EIR certification.

6 90.

7 The Development Department did not provide an adequate description of the Tropico

8 Center Plan, which was ultimately approved as the Project (e.g., the number of dwelling units to be
added or the population increase associated with the Plan).

9 91.

10 The Development Department continuously verbally assured that the SGCP Project will

11 be implemented only after transit is in place, whereas no such assurance is given in the SGCP or its EIR.

92.

12 The Development Department continuously verbally assured that the approved SGCP

13 Project will apply only to the Tropico Center Plan, whereas the votes of both the unwitting Planning

14 Commission and the City Council included amendments to the General Plan. The Development

15 Department's later statement in the Resolution document that the amendments to the General Plan apply

16 only to the SGCP area rather than to Glendale in general are inapposite.

93.

17 The Development Department continuously assured that the approved SGCP Project

18 would not change any zoning or increase density anywhere in South Glendale or in the approved

19 Tropico Center Plan of the SGCP, whereas the Notice of Determination filed with the State

20 Clearinghouse includes zone changes and implies density increases.

94.

21 Respondents violated Petitioner's constitutional due process rights and failed to act in

22 good faith by arbitrarily and capriciously denying California Public Records Act requests made on

23 behalf of Petitioner on July 3 and 17, 2018 regarding the SGCP.

95.

24 a As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents' approvals of the SGCP and its EIR

25 must be set aside and declared null and void because those were approved, in part, based on the

26 Development Department's materially misleading and false assurances, as well as the Respondents'
arbitrary and capricious withholding of public records.
