Pitbed on Reettled Piper

Petitioner, PROTECT OUR NEIGHBORHOODS, allege as follows:

INTRODUCTION
2
1. Petitioner PROTECT OUR NEIGHBORHOODS ("PON" or "Petitioner") brings
3 this action to invalidate the City of Palm Springs' unlawful issuance of the below-named Vacation

4 Rental Registration Certificates ("Certificates"). PON contends the City's issuance of the

5 challenged Certificates was an abuse of discretion because the Certificates were issued in violation

6 of the City's zoning code, which requires a land use or conditional a use permit for commercial
businesses in residentially zoned neighborhoods. Additionally, PON contends the issuance of said

8 Certificates without any environmental review or adequate notice to residents was in violation of

CEQA.
9
II. THE PARTIES

10 2. Petitioner and Complainant, PON, is a California non-profit membership
11 organization dedicated to the preservation and enhancement of residential neighborhoods in Palm
12 Springs. Since 2013 PON has urged the City of Palm Springs to adhere to the terms of the General

13 Plan and zoning code and protect the public health and welfare by managing the unchecked

14 proliferation of vacation rentals in Palm Springs. Members of PON work, reside, and recreate in
Palm Springs. PON brings this action on its own behalf, for its members, and in the public
15
interest.

16 3. Respondent and Defendant, City of Palm Springs ("City") is a local governmental

17 agency and subdivision of the State of California charged with authority to regulate and administer

18 land usé and development within its territory in conformity with the provisions of the City's
19 General Plan, Municipal Code and all applicable provisions of state law, including the California
Environmental Quality Act, the Planning and Zoning law, and the Subdivision Map Act. 20

.

* 4. Respondent and Defendant City Council of Palm Springs ("City Council") is the

2 legislative body and highest administrative body of the City. The City Council is ultimately
responsible for the City's land use policies and decisions, including the decision to abide the
3
operation of vacation rental businesses in single-family residential neighborhoods without any
4 CEQA review or any kind of land use permit.

5 5. The City Council and the City of Palm Springs, hereafter shall be collectively
6 referred to as the "City" or "Respondents".

6. Real Parties in Interest Scott and Beverly Gaitan (Certificate City ID No. 297),

8 James and Karen Sleighter (Certificate City ID No. 3829), Jeffery and Nancy Klemperer
(Certificate City ID No. 1875), Enenbach Michael Thomas Coogia (Certificate City ID No. 3345),
9
Dennis Potvin (Certificate City ID No. 2570), Joseph Ambrosavage (Certificate City ID No.1101),
10 Cheney and William Shapiro (Certificate City ID No. 907), and Bobbie Sheets (Certificate City ID
11 No. 3879) are the individual property owners whose Certificates are being challenged.

12 7. Petitioner does not know the identity of DOES 1-25, but will amend the Petition as
13 required to specifically identify each such person or entity a as a real party in interest if the identity,

14 interest and capacity of such party, if any, becomes known.
III. PROCEDURAL ALLEGATIONS
15
8. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant action
16 and has exhausted any and all administrative remedies to the extent required by law, by inter alia,
17 submitting written and oral comments on the issues that are the subject of this lawsuit.

18 9. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code ("Pub.
19 Res. Code") § 21167.5 by corresponding the commencement of this action to Respondents prior to

20 filing this petition and complaint.

21 PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF .3 -

22 Printed on |

10. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Pub. Res. Code § 21167.7 and
Code of Civil Procedure § 388 by mailing a copy of the Petition/Complaint to the state Attorney
2
General.
3
11. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law

4 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to rescind
5 Certificates issued without adequate environmental review of the impacts of the vacation rentals,

as required by CEQA, and not to approve any additional vacation rentals except pursuant to a

7 I permit as required by the City's own zoning regulation and General Plan.

12.
8 If Respondents are not compelled to rescind Certificates to vacation rentals issued
without adequate environmental review and a permit as required by the City's zoning code,
9 Petitioner will suffer irreparable harm from which there is no adequate remedy at law in that the
10 character of the neighborhoods in which these vacation rentals are located will be significantly and
11 permanently altered and disturbed on a potentially infinite basis, without any environmental review
12 as required by CEQA.

13 13. In pursuing this action, which involves enforcement of important rights affecting

14 the public interest, Petitioner will confer a substantial benefit on the general public and residents of
Palm Springs, and therefore will be entitled to attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to, inter alia,
15
Code of Civil Procedure §1021.5.

16 14. Petitioner brings this action in part pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §1085 or
17 81094.5, which require that an agency's approval of a Project be set aside if the agency has
18 prejudicially abused its discretion. Prejudicial abuse of discretion occurs either where an agency

19 has failed to proceed in a manner required by law or where its determination or decision is not

20 supported by substantial evidence. Respondents have prejudicially abused their discretion because

21 PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

22 Printed on Recycled Paper

Respondents have failed to proceed according to the law, and their decision is not supported by

substantial evidence.
2
15. PON contends the City's approval of the Certificates referenced in this Petition was 3 unlawful because the City failed to undertake any environmental review as required by CEQA
4 prior to approving the Certificates. PON also seeks a judicial declaration indicating that the City's
5 approval of the Certificates in City's single-family residential neighborhoods is unlawful and in

6 violation of the City's zoning code, which does not specifically authorize the operation of vacation
7 rentals in single-family residential neighborhoods, but does require a Land Use Permit or

8 Conditional Use Permit for any business that is similar to the business of vacation rentals.
Petitioner further seeks a judicial declaration indicating that the City's approval of vacation rentals
9 in condominiums violates the City's zoning code and is directly contradicted by the City's own
10 findings.

11 IV. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

12 16. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
13  $§ 1085 and 1094.5. Venue is proper in this Court because the action concerns the City of Palm

14 Springs, which is located in Riverside County.

V. STATEMENT OF FACTS
15
17. Chapter 5.25 of the Palm Springs Municipal Code ("PSMC"), otherwise referred to
16 as the "Vacation Rental Ordinance," governs vacation rentals within the City of Palm Springs.
17 18. The City amended the Vacation Rental Ordinance on April 2, 2014, through the
18|| adoption of Ordinance No. 1848. In adopting this Resolution, the City Council declared that "use
19 single and multiple-family dwelling units for Vacation Rental lodging" ... "in certain single-family

20 neighborhoods may have effects that can best be addressed through an appropriate city regulatory

21 PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ,5-

22 Printsd on Recycted Paper

1 program." PSMC §5.25.00(a). The City further declared the purpose of the Vacation Rental
Ordinance (PSMC Ch. 5.25) to 2 be the establishment of regulations for use of residential properties
for vacation rental purposes "thereby enabling the City to preserve the public health, safety and
3
welfare." PSMC $5.25.00(c).

4 19. Ordinance No. 1848 required owners of vacation rentals to obtain a valid
5 "Vacation Rental Registration Certificate." The requirements for obtaining such a Certificate,
6 | however, are minimal. To obtain a Certificate, the registrant, which could be the owner, investor

7 or a management agency, was required to provide basic information, such as name, address and

8 phone number of the property owner or the owner's agent, name and contact information for a
local contact, information about the residential property such as number of bedrooms, a valid 9
a business license, a valid "transient occupancy registration" certificate, as well as any "other
10 information" deemed reasonably necessary by the City Manager. PSMC §5.25.060.
11 20. Ordinance No. 1848 included limits on the number of day-time and night-time
12 occupants based on the number of bedrooms. The Ordinance included other generic requirements
to make the owner/agent responsible for informing occupants about City regulations 13| designed

14 concerning noise, trash, etc. It further required owners/agents to pay standard Transit Occupancy
Taxes ("TOT") at the same rate as any other small hotels or bed and breakfasts.
15
21. Significantly, Ordinance No. 1848 did not impose any limits on the number of days
16 any unit could be rented out, or the number of Vacation Rental units any person or corporation
17 could own in Palm Springs.

18 22. In response to the exponential growth of vacation rentals in Palm Springs, the City

19 adopted Urgency Ordinance No. 1891 to prohibit the conversion of apartments and condominiums

20

21 PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 6-

22 Printed on Rusycled Paper

to vacation rentals. The City Council explained the need for this urgency ordinance by making the

2 following findings:

3 The City Council is "concerned regarding the potentially adverse impacts that the
conversion of rental apartment units to vacation rental uses may have on the City's

un rental housing stock and resident socio-economic population mix."
"There is current and immediate threat to the public health, safety, and welfare
because conversions of apartment units to vacation rentals could displace
apartment residents and drive these residents out of Palm Springs, eroding the

8 City's resident socio-economic population mix but also adversely impacting City

9 business that rely on residents in that mix as a valuable employee pool."

10 The City reiterated that the use of single-family dwellings for Vacation Rental

11 lodging in single-family neighborhoods "may have effects that can be best be

12 addressed through an appropriate city regulatory program." 5.25.020(a).

•

13 The City determined that limiting vacation rentals to single-family neighborhoods
"will preserve and protect residential housing stock in the City"; however, the City

14 has not identified any substantial evidence to support this contention.

15 23. On July 13, 2016, the City extended Urgency Ordinance No. 1891 to November

16 2017. However, on October 18, 2016 the City adopted Ordinance No. 1902 to permanently codify

17 the prohibition against the conversion of apartments and condominiums to vacation rentals.

24. The City continued to debate and discuss the future of vacation rentals through
18 2016. The City Council conducted a Study Session on October 26, 2016 and a regular hearing on
19 November 30, 2016, to discuss and introduce a modification to the Vacation Rental Ordinance,

20

21 PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 7-

22 Prinied on Recycled Foper

1 which included the creation of the Department of Vacation Rental Enforcement, modification of
user fees and registration guidelines.

25. The Staff Report for the November 30, 2016 City Council hearing explained that
3
the Vacation Rental Subcommittee had conducted several public meetings to identify goals and
4 objectives for the Vacation Rental Ordinance. The goals and objectives identified by the
5 Subcommittee include the following:

6 Short-term rentals are an ancillary use of residences for full and part-time residents;
Short-term rentals are not a business for the benefit of investors or for real estate

8 speculation;

Priority goal is preserving our neighborhoods for full and part-time residents; 9
Preserve and maintain long-term rental stock for workers, families and those who
10
cannot afford a down payment to buy home;
11 Level the playing field between small hotels and vacation rentals and ensure the

12 health and safety of residents and tourists;

13 Reduce the use of short-term rentals as party houses for "weekend warriors."

14 26. The Staff Report stated that the number of vacation rentals in Palm Springs had

15 risen from 960 in 2009 to about 1,936 units in November 2016, plus an additional 175 pending
applications. The Staff Report also described the City's efforts to address the myriad of 16.
complaints lodged by City residents about vacation rentals in single-family neighborhoods.
17
27. To address these concerns, goals and objectives, the Vacation Rental Subcommittee
18 recommended a series of amendments to the Vacation Rental Ordinance. In order to ensure
19 Vacation Rentals are maintained only as an ancillary use for full or part-time residents, and not

20

21 PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF •8 -

22 Printed on Recytied Paper

managed a as a business venture, the Subcommittee recommended the following revisions to the

Vacation Rental Ordinance:

• Vacation Rentals must be owned by a natural person or the trust of a natural person
3
Individuals, family trusts, or limited liability companies can maintain financial
4 ownership interest in only single vacation rental unit

5 Vacation rentals are to be permitted only through the owner---not through an

6 agency

28. To preserve single-family neighborhoods and level the playing field between small

8 hotels and Vacation Rentals, the Subcommittee recommended that the Vacation Rental Ordinance

be revised as follows:

Limit occupancy to two per bedroom
10
Limit number of contracts per year to 28

11 29. The Subcommittee also recommended a number of additional measures to enhance

12 the City's ability regulate vacation rentals by

13 Increase fines for violations, which would be levied against permit holder

14 Annual inspections

15 15 Require 30-minute response time from permit holder, etc.

30. Significantly, the Subcommittee recommended that all existing multiple vacation
16
rental permit holders would be grandfathered only until January 1, 2021. The current Ordinance
17 grandfathered all existing units and does not include a sunset provision.

18 31. To effectuate these goals and policies, the City adopted Ordinance 1907 which
19 amended and restated the City's Vacation Rental Ordinance. This Ordinance, while far from
20 perfect, included certain provisions that were at least intended to effectuate the City's stated goals

21 PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 9-

22 Printed on Recyded Paper

and objectives vis-à-vis regulation of vacation rentals. After years of denial, the City finally

admitted that vacation rental is a business:

Vacation Rentals are not uses specifically recognized in the City's Zoning Ordinance, nor are these uses identified as uses permitted in single-family and multi-family zones. Vacation Rentals and Homesharing are similar in characters and use as hotels and other commercial short-term uses and can only be permitted
in single-family or multi-family zones if such uses are ancillary and secondary to

5 the residential use of the property, 5.25.020(a).

32. The City further concluded that:
6
Incidents involving excessive noise, disorderly conduct, vandalism, overcrowding,
traffic congestion, parking congestion, and the accumulation of refuse, require
response from police, fire, paramedic, and other City services associated with this

8 secondary, ancillary, commercial use escalates the demand for City services, creates adverse impacts in residential areas of the City, and adversely affects the City's residential neighborhoods. Vacation Rentals and Homesharing use in residential
9 neighborhoods may have effects that can best be addressed through an appropriate city regulatory program. §5.25.020(b).
10 33. Ordinance No. 1907 included a number of provisions that were designed to ensure
11 vacation rentals were operated not as a business, but as ancillary to bona fide residential use of the
12 property. For example, the Ordinance prohibited the issuance of registration certificates to any

13 business entity other than a Limited Liability Company, or a natural person or a personal or family a

14 trust. Moreover, the Ordinance prohibited any aforementioned entity from maintaining any
financial interest in more than a single Vacation Rental. §5.25.040(b).
15
34. The Ordinance granted current holders of financial interest in multiple Vacation
16 Rentals until January 1, 2021 to comply with the terms of §5.25.040(b).

17 35. §5.25.070(b) limited the number of times a property could be used as a vacation

18 rental to 32 contracts per calendar year.

Challenge to and Repeal of Ordinance No. 1907

36. In response to the adoption of Ordinance No. 1907, the Vacation Rental Industry

hired a large public relations and political consultant to push back. A group called Citizens for a
3
Better Palm Springs ("CFBPS") was organized to lead the fight against the City's effort to adopt

4 modest restrictions on the operation of Vacation Rentals in Palm Springs. According to the Desert

5 Sun:

6 "Citizens for a Better Palm Springs" lists Jim Madaffer, principal of Madaffer Enterprises,
as its chief officer, according to the California Form 410 filed with Palm Springs City Hall
on Dec. 12. Madaffer Enterprises is a public affairs and communications consulting firm
based in San Diego, which has listed HomeÄway, the second largest (after AirBnb)

8 national online listing site for vacation rentals, as a client during the recent debates on the
properties in Palm Springs.' (http://www.desertsun.com/story/money/business/tourism/2017/01/03/petition-drive-aims-
9 send-palm-springs-vacation-rentals-restrictions-voters/96134186/).

10 37. CFBPS circulated a referendum petition whose stated purpose was for the City

Council to reconsider and repeal Ordinance No. 1907 or submit the Ordinance to the voters at the
11
next regular election scheduled for November 8, 2017.
12
38. At its February 15, 2017 City Council meeting, the City Clerk reported that it had

13 examined the referendum petition reported that the requisite 100% signature
14 verification/examination was performed. The Clerk reported that referendum proponents had

15 collected 2,880 valid signatures, which exceeded the minimum requirement to put the referendum

16 on the ballot.

39.
17 Instead of submitting the referendum to the voters, consistent with Election Code
§9237 & §9241, the City elected to repeal Ordinance No. 1907 and to immediately adopt an
18
urgency ordinance. Unfortunately, the City Council was not able to adopt an urgency ordinance.
19 While three members of the City Council voted to approve the urgency ordinance, it was

20

21 PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 11 -

22 Printed on Rocycled Paper

ultimately defeated because 4 out of 5 members of the City Council must agree to ratify an
urgency ordinance.

40. The Staff Report concerning the Urgency Vacation Rental Ordinance explained
3 that the Council's Subcommittee on Vacation Rentals "is concerned that the suspension of

4 Ordinance No. 1907 may create a vacuum where there may be a flood of applications for vacation

5 rentals certificates without due regard for constrains and limits in the new, regulatory approach

6 41. The Urgency Ordinance would have grandfathered all existing Vacation Rentals,

including corporate-owned units or those owned by owners of multiple Vacation Rentals.

42. The Urgency Ordinance included a provision requiring Vacation Rentals in a so-

called Estate Home to obtain a Land Use Permit coupled with an administrative review process.
9
43. On March 15, 2017 the City Council adopted Ordinance No. 1918 which represents
10 the current policy for vacation rentals within the City and goes in to effect within 30 days. Notable
11 aspects of Ordinance No. 1918 include:

12 the grandfathering of all existing vacation rentals regardless of the character of

13 ownership;

14 the requirement that vacation rentals proposed in "Estate Homes" to obtain a Limited
Use Permit ("LUP"), prohibiting any business entity other than a limited liability 15
companies from running a vacation rental;
16
and limiting individuals, family trusts or limited liability company to maintaining
17 financial ownership in a single vacation rental unit.

18 44. While the Ordinance requires vacation rentals to be a use that is ancillary or
19 incidental to the residential use of the property, there Ordinance does not include any measures to

20
is Estate Home is defined as a single-family dwelling with five or more bedrooms.

21 PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT OF FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 12 -

22 Printed on Recyded Paper

ensure the owner of the property establish he/she resides in the dwelling for any significant length

of time.

45.• Significantly, Ordinance No. 1918 does not require non-Estate single-family
3 dwellings to obtain any type of permit and does not include any restrictions on the total number of

4 vacation rentals in any residential street or neighborhood. Nor did the City undertake any

5 environmental review of its vacation rental program in connection with the adoption of Ordinance
6 No. 1918. The new Ordinance does not include any meaningful restrictions on the location or

number of vacation rentals as a means to protect the residential character of particular

neighborhoods; requires no environmental review for the approval of individual Vacation Rental
Certificates and was not subject to any meaningful environmental review of potential
environmental impacts of vacation rentals or potentially feasible mitigation measures and/or
10. alternatives.

11 46. By adopting Ordinance No 1918, the City Council now admits that vacation rental
12| is a commercial use that is not specified as an allowable use in the City's zoning code:

13 Vacation Rentals and Homesharing are not uses specifically recognized in the City's
Zoning Ordinance, nor are these uses expressly identified as uses permitted in

14 single-family or multi-family zones. Vacation Rentals and Homesharing are similar in character and use as hotels and other commercial short term uses and can only be
permitted in single-family or multi-family zones if such uses are ancillary and
15 secondary to the residential use of property.

16 The City's zoning regulation of commercial use of residential properties

47.
17 As the City's adoption of Ordinance No. 1907 and the text of the proposed Urgency

Vacation Rental Ordinance (which was ratified by of the 5 City Councilmembers) demonstrate,
18
the City has finally stopped perpetuating the myth that Vacation Rentals are not a commercial
19 business.

20

21 PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF • 13 -

22 Frinted on Recycled Paper

48. According to the Palm Springs Municipal Code, only limited commercial uses are

2 allowed in a residential zone. Vacation Rentals are not a specified commercial use in PSMC
§92.01.01.
3
49. To the extent the PSMC does allow commercial uses in single-family

4 neighborhoods, it does so only subject to obtaining a specified permit. Under the City's Code, less
5 intense uses require a Land Use Permit ("LUP") (PSMC §92.01.01 (C)), while more intense uses,
6 such as child care centers; require a Conditional Use Permit ("CUP"). PSMC §92.01.01(D).

50. Palm Springs General Plan Policy HS1.8 directs the City to "Protect established

single-family residential neighborhoods from the transition, intensification, and encroachment of

uses that detract and/or change the character of the neighborhood." The City's own findings

demonstrate that the widespread conversion of residential dwellings to Vacation Rentals results in
10 intensification of use that can cause profound changes in the character of residential
11 neighborhoods.

12 51. On September 30, 2017 the City issued the following Certificates:

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
(Declaratory Relief)
52. PON refers to and incorporates herein by this reference all preceding paragraphs of

this Petition as though fully set forth herein.

53. The City has already declared that Vacation Rental is a commercial use,

5 functionally identical to small hotels and other short-term rentals, that is not a specified use in
residential neighborhoods, and should not be allowed except as a use that is ancillary to private
6
residential use of a single-family dwelling.

54. The City's vacation rental program allows for any individual or limited liability
8 companies to obtain a Vacation Rental Certificate without any type of land use permit or
9 environmental or other case-by-case review. Such hastily obtained Vacation Rental Certificates

10 may establish permanent vacation rentals without any limit on the number of vacation rentals in a

11 neighborhood or regard for inconsistency with or the impact on residential neighborhoods.

55. Even if Vacation Rentals were to be permitted in single-family residential
12
neighborhoods, the City's zoning ordinance requires all commercial uses in residential
13 neighborhoods to obtain either an LUP or CUP. Currently, the City has no regulation in place to

14 require an LUP or CUP for any proposed Vacation Rental in any single-family dwellings including
15 so-called Estate Homes.

16 56. PON further contends that the City's past and current practice of allowing absentee

17 owners and ownership of Vacation Rentals by limited liability companies, is inconsistent with and

violates the City's often-stated policy that Vacation Rentals "can only be permitted in single-
18
family or multi-family zones if such uses are ancillary and secondary to the residential use of
19
property."

20

21 PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF • 15 -

22 Printed on Recyded Paper

57. Accordingly, an actual controversy exists between PON and the City of Palm

2 Springs. Petitioner and Plaintiff PON contends that the City cannot lawfully issue a Vacation
Rental Certificate for any proposed single-family dwelling or Estate Home except subject to an
3 LUP or CUP. PON further contends that the City's current regulatory scheme violates the City's
own stated policy of allowing Vacation Rentals in single-family or multi-family zones only if the
5 short-term rental is ancillary and secondary to the residential use of the property, as well as
General Plan Policy HS1.8 which directs the City to "Protect established single-family residential

7 neighborhoods from the transition, intensification, and encroachment of uses that detract and/or

8 change the character of the neighborhood."
WHEREFORE, PON prays for declaratory judgment against Respondents, as set forth
9
herein below.

10 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

11 (Violation of CEQA as to the named Certificates)

12 58. PON refers to and incorporates herein by this reference all preceding paragraphs of

13 this Petition as though fully set forth herein.

59.
14 Approval of a Certificate amounts to a discretionary approval of a "project" within

the meaning of CEQA.
15
60. There is ample evidence in the record to show that cach Vacation Rental Certificate
16 listed in Paragraph 51 above could potentially causes significant direct, indirect and cumulative
17 impacts on the human environment. As the City's own findings in support of the adoption of the
18 Ordinance admit, such impacts include but are not limited to impacts on noise, traffic and

19 circulation, vandalism, trash, etc. These impacts exceed similar impacts that would be caused by

20 private or long-term occupancy of single-family dwellings by long-term tenants or private owners.

61. The impacts associated with these Certificates tax the City's resources by requiring

additional police, paramedics, firefighters, trash, water, sewage, and other services.

62. Owing to the absence of any limits on the number of Vacation Rentals that can be
3
( approved in any neighborhood, the cumulative impact of these Certificates in the same block or

4 neighborhood hub as existing vacation rentals can adversely impact the quality of life in the
5 neighborhood.

6 63. Despite acknowledging the significant direct, indirect and cumulative impact of
Vacation Rentals on single-family neighborhoods and the City as a whole, the City has never
undertaken any adequate environmental review prior to issuing the listed Certificates. 8
WHEREFORE, PON prays for declaratory judgment against Respondents, as set forth
9
herein below.

•* 10 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

11 (Violation of Zoning Law and the City's Municipal Code as to the named Certificates)

12 64. PON refers to and incorporates herein by this reference all preceding paragraphs of

13 this Petition as though fully set forth herein.

65.
14 The City abused its discretion and violated its zoning code by not requiring the

vacation rentals listed in Paragraph 51 above to obtain a Land Use Permit. Under the City's zoning
15
code, a Land Use Permit is required for home occupations, small daycares, and other less intense
16 commercial uses in residential neighborhoods similar to vacation rentals.

17 66. Under Ordinance No. 1918 the City can issue vacation rentals in neighborhoods

18 zoned for residential use. The vacation rentals, further, do not require the necessary permits for

19 such commercial uses in residential zones. With no numerical cap or any other restrictions, or

20 environmental review, the City violated its own General Plan mandate to protect the character of

1 neighborhoods from the encroachment of uses that change the character of the neighborhood by
issuing the Certificates listed in Paragraph 51 above.

WHEREFORE, PON prays for declaratory judgment against Respondents, as set forth

herein below.

FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

(Abuse of discretion, violation of City Municipal Ordinance)

6 67. PON refers to and incorporates herein by this reference all preceding paragraphs of

this Petition as though fully set forth herein.

68.
8 The City's approval of the following Certificates was in violation of the City's

Code §5.25.030, which limits vacation rentals to single-family dwellings or condominium hotels

69. The City's Code §91.00.10, which defines condominium hotels as "a commercial
12 condominium project with units within a hotel or resort hotel that are individually owned." None of the

13 condominiums at issue here are within a hotel or resort hotel.

14 70. The City's approval of the above-referenced Certificates to condominiums that are

15 not within a "condominium hotel" directly contradicts the City's own definition of condominium

16 hotels and the City's stated purpose of protecting affordable, multi-unit residential housing stock.

71. To the extent the City claims it is long standing policy to issue vacation rental
17
certificates to condominium units, this policy directly contradicts its legislative acts and findings.

18 WHEREFORE, PON prays for judgment against the City of Palm Springs and Palm

b. For declaratory judgment, stating the Vacation Rental Certificates issued in
Paragraph 51 above, violate the City's Municipal Code and zoning laws;

C. For declaratory judgment, stating that the Vacation Rental Certificates listed

in Paragraph 67 above issued to multi-family units, including condominiums, violates the

City's Municipal Code and zoning laws;

invalidate the Vacation Rental Certificates listed in paragraph 51 above;
