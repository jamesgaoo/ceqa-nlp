1. By this action, Petitioner SIERRA CLUB challenges Respondents CALIFORNIA
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION and DIRECTOR LAURIE BERMAN'S approval of
the Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND") for State Route 65 Capacity and Operational
Improvements Project ("Project"), the required findings under the California Environmental
Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code, section 21000 et seq., and the approval of the
Project. The MND asserts that the purpose of the Project is to relieve existing morning and
[ evening peak period congestion. The Initial Study ("IS")/MND demonstrates that Project would
cQ increase speeds by only two miles per hour in the a.m. peak period and 4 miles per hour in the

9 p.m. peak hour under the 2040 build alternative s compared to the 2040 no build alternative.

10 2. The IS/MND does not provide adequate environmental review under CEQA.

11 Despite the Project's potentially significant and unmitigated impacts to traffic, noise, growth-

12 inducement, air quality, climate change, and other environmental resources, Caltrans approved
13 the Project without preparing an EIR. The IS/MND failed to adequately analyze many of the
14 proposed Project's impacts and many 1S/MND mitigation measures are general assertions that
15 something will be done in the future about the Project's significant environmental impacts. Such
16 deferred analysis and mitigation violate CEQA.

17 3. Petitioner seeks a determination from this Court that Respondents' approval of the
18 Project is invalid and void and that Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Project

19 fails to satisfy the requirements of CEQA, and the CEQA Guidelines, Title 14, California Code

20 of Regulations, section 15000 et seq.

PARTIES 21
22 4. Petitioner Sierra Club is a California nonprofit membership organization
23 incorporated under the laws of the State of California in 1892. Currently, the Sierra Club has

24 approximately 820,000 members, approximately 180,000 of whom live in California.

25 Approximately 20,000 members belong to the Sierra Club's Motherlode Chapter, which

26 includes approximately 2,100 member of the Placer Group in Placer County. The Sierra Club
27 functions to educate and enlist people to protect and restore the natural and human environment,

28 to practice and promote responsible use of the earth's ecosystems and resources, to explore,

2 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

oNaUD. 0/ enjoy, and protect wild places, and to use all lawful means to achieve these objectives. The
Sierra Club has expressed particular concern for the environment in which its members live,
including Placer County. Chapter members live, work, travel and enjoy recreational activities
in Placer County. Sierra Club and its members are adversely affected by Respondents' failure
to comply with CEQA in approving the Project. Sierra Club submitted written comments on the
Initial Study and the IS/MND.

5. Respondent California Department of Transportation ("CalTrans") is an agency of

9 the State of California. CalTrans is the CEQA "lead agency" for the Project. As lead agency

10 for the Project, CalTrans is responsible for preparation of an environmental document and

11 describes the Project and its impacts, and if necessary evaluates mitigation measures and/or

12 alternatives to lessen or avoid any significant environmental impacts. CalTrans is responsible

13 for implementing and complying with the provisions of CBQA and the CEQA Guidelines with
respect to the Project.

14 6.

15 Respondent Laurie Berman is the Director of CalTrans. As Director, Ms Berman

16 is responsible for the day-to-day operation of CalTrans. Ms. Berman is sued in her official
capacity as Director of CalTrans.

17 7.

18 Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents identified as

19 Does 1-20. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Respondents Does

20 1-20, inclusive, are individuals, entities or agencies with material interests affected by the Project

21 with respect to the Project or by the County's actions with respect to the Project. When the true

22 identities and capacities of these Respondents have been determined, Petitioner will, with leave

23 of Court if necessary, amend this Petition to insert such identities and capacities.

8.

24 Real Party in Interest Placer County Transportation Planning Agency is

25 responsible for all transportation planning activities in Placer County (excluding the Tahoe

26 basin) and transportation revenue allocation. The Placer County Transportation Agency is

27 composed of nine members: two from the Placer County Board of Supervisors; one member

28 appointed by the Board of Supervisors and one member from City of Roseville, City of
Rocklin, City of Lincoln; City of Auburn; Town of Loomis; and City of Colfax. The Placer

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 3

- a County Transportation Planning Agency is a responsible agency and joint preparer of the
Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration.

9. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of Real Parties in Interest
identified as Does 21-100. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that
2 tO [ Respondents Does 21-100, inclusive, are individuals, entities or agencies with material
interests affected by the Project or by CalTrang' actions with respect to the Project. When the
true identities and capacities of these Real Parties in Interest have been determined, Petitioner
cO will, with leave of Court if necessary, amend this Petition to insert such identities and

9 capacities.

10 BACKGROUND EACTS
11 THE PROJECT
12 10. State Route 65 is the north-south transportation route in the west/south Placer
13 County area. SR 65 departs to the north west from I-80 as a four-lane divided highway over a
14 viaduct between Roseville on the west and Rocklin on the east; it turns north at the Blue Oaks

15 Boulevard interchange; it then proceeds north to Lincoln Boulevard/Old SR 65 which goes into
16 Lincoln. It then continues north west and west past Nelson Lane where a new interchange is

17 proposed; then swinging north between North Dowd Road on the west and Airport Road, it

18 goes due north until crossing Wise Road, after which the divided northbound highway ends.

19 Then the two-lane bypass route goes north-northwest to the intersection with Riolo Road and

20 Sheridan. It then merges with Old Route 65 and proceeds northwest across the county line to
21 Wheatland.

22 11. The Project widens State Route ("SR") 65 from north of Galleria Boulevard/

23 Stanford Ranch Road to Lincoln Boulevard in Placer County. The total length of the Project is

24 6.3 miles along SR 65. CalTrans asserts that the additional capacity would help planned and

25 anticipated growth along the corridor and would help achieve the mobility and economic

26 development goals to PCTPA.

27 12. The Initial Study identified two build alternatives: Alternative 1 - Carpool

28 Alternative and Alternative 2 - General Purpose Lane Alternative. Both alternatives have

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 4

common design details that include highway widening, Pleasant Grove Creek bridge widening;
ramp metering; and utility relocation.
en †100c 13. The Initial Study fails to identify a preferred alternative.

B. CALTRANS' APPROVAL OF THE PROJECT

14. In May 2017, CalTrans released for public review and comment the Initial Study
with Proposed Negative Declaration.

15, On March 6, 2018, CalTrans approved the Project and found the Project will not
have a significant effect on the environment.

9 16. On March 6, 2018, CalTrans field with the State of California, Office of Planning

10 and Research (State Clearing House) Notice of Determination under Public Resources Code,

11 section 21152. The Notice of Determination fails to identify which alternative CalTrans

12 approved.

13 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

14 17. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to

15 Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, and Public Resources Code section 211685. In the

16 alternative, this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and

17 Public Resources Code section 21168.

18 18. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 394(a), venue is proper in this Court
19 because CalTrans is located in the County of Sacramento.

20 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES
AND INADEQUACYOF REMEDY 21

22 19. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant action

23 and has exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

24 20. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code, section

25 21167.5 by sending via facsimile and Federal Express written notice of this action to the

26 Respondents. A copy of this written notice and proof of service are attached as Exhibit A to this

27 Petition for Writ of Mandate.

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 5

-N m tnON 0o e 21. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.6 by
concurrently filing a request concerning preparation of the record of administrative proceedings
relating to this action.

22. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require respondents to set aside their
approval of the Project and certification of the EIR. In the absence of such remedies,
CalTrans' approval will remain in effect in violation of State law.

23. This action has been brought within 30 days of CalTrans filing of the Notice of
Determination as required by Public Resources Code section 21167(c).
STANDING 10

11 24. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because

12 Petitioner and its members' aesthetic and environmental interests are directly and adversely
13 affected by the CalTrans' approval of the Project.

CAUSE OF ACTION 14
(Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act, 15 Public Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)
16 25. Petitioner realleges and incorporate by reference Paragraphs 1 through 24, o inclusive, of this Petition, as if fully set forth below.

26. Respondents committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in
a manner required by law by relying on an EIR that fails to meet the requirements of CEQA for
20 disclosure, analysis, and/or mitigation of significant project impacts.
21 27. Respondents' action in adopting the IS/MND violates CEQA in that Respondents
22 failed to proceed in the manner required by law and their decision not to prepare an EIR is not
23 supported by substantial evidence.
24 28. The IS/MND identifies two alternatives: Alternative 1 - Carpool Alternative and
25 Alternative 2 - General Purpose Lane Alternative. The Notice of Determination fails to identify
26 which alternative Respondents approved. Respondents fail to identify which alternative was
27 constitutes the approved Project.
28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

4 l 29; The IS/MND relies upon an inaccurate baseline to analyze the Project's impacts.
The IS/MND relies upon outdated data to describe baseline conditions. For example, the
m+o D co IS/MND uses 2012 conditions to describe baseline air quality data and traffic data from 2009 to
2012 to describe existing conditions. The IS/MND's failure to provide an adequate baseline
impacts the IS/MND's ability to meaningfully analyze the Project's impacts.
record supports a "fair argument" that 30. Substantial evidence in the administrative

the Project may result in a significant impact to the environment. The substantial evidence
before Respondents demonstrate, at a minimum, that:

9 d. The Project may have significant impacts to air quality. The IS/MND

10 relies upon outdated traffic data to evaluate the Project's air quality impacts. The IS/MND also

11 fails to provide a description of its methodological approach or analysis in used in its air quality

12 analysis. The Project has the potential to result in significant increase in mobile source air

13 toxics due to the substantial increase in average daily traffic on SR 65. The Project may result

14 in impacts to air quality resulting from induced demand resulting in additional Vehicle Miles

15 Travelled ("VMT') and air quality emissions.

16 b. The IS/MND also fails to include thresholds for determining the Project's

17 air quality impacts. For example, although the Project's increase in construction-related NOx

18 emission exceeds the Placer County Air Pollution Control District's thresholds of significance,

19 the IS/MND concludes that the emissions would be less than significant.

20 The Project may have significant impacts to Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

21 Despite evidence in the IS/MND indicating that the Project would result in significant GHG

22 emissions, the IS/MND found that it is too speculative to make a determination regarding

23 significance of the project's direct impact and its contribution on the cumulative scale to climate

24 change. The Project, with its yearly emissions of more than 32,000 tons per year of CO2

25 (IS/MND exceeds the commonly established thresholds of significance. Its contribution to

26 climate change must therefore be considered significant.

27 d. The Project has the potential to result in a significant increase in

28 operational noise. The IS/MND relies on an unrealistically high threshold for evaluating

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-NmtnOrda impacts and then concludes that such impacts would be less than significant. The IS/MND
asserts that significant traffic noise impacts are considered to occur at receptor locations where
predicted design-year noise levels are at least 12 dB higher than existing noise levels. The
IS/MND, however, fails to explain as to why it relies on this inappropriately high threshold.
This threshold is not appropriate under CEQA. The project may have a significant noise impact
as it results in substantial permanent increase in ambient noise levels in the project vicinity
above levels existing without the Project.
The Project may have significant impacts to noise related to construction.
The IS/MND fails to provide a specific analysis of the construction related noise impacts and
10 fails to provide any mitigation for the potentially significant impacts.
11 f. The Project may have significant impacts to biological resources and vernal

12 pools. The IS/MND fail to adequately discuss, analyze and mitigate the Project's impact to

13 biological resources and vernal pools.

14 31. The Project has growth-inducing impacts that the IS/MND fails to address. The

15 widening of SR 65 and increasing capacity removes one of the primary barriers to growth in the
16 area: inadequate traffic capacity, The Project would facilitate access and induce development

17 and growth on vacant land in the vicinity of the Project. Adding lanes increases capacity for
18 awhile but eventually induces more congestion, more VMT and increases GHG emissions.
19 The widening of SR 65 widening will allow for new interchanges, and the Placer Parkway. As
20 a result, the Project will result in the development of open lands, wetlands and vernal pools.

21 32. The IS/MND fails to address the Project's cumulative impacts as required by
22 Public Resources Code, section 21083(b) and CEQA Guidelines, section 15064(i). The

23 IS/MND fails to address the Project's cumulative impacts to biological and agricultural

24 resources.

25 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

26 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as follows:
27 1. That this Court issue a peremptory writ of mandate ordering Respondents to:
28
