INTRODUCTION

1. Petitioners Raemar Crest, LLC and Brilliant Projects, LLC (collectively "Petitioners") challenge
the County of Santa Barbara and Board of Supervisors of the County of Santa Barbara's (collectively
4 "the County" or "Respondents") approval of the Feldman New Residence (Project), and adoption of the
Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND) for the Project. The Project involves the demolition of the
6 existing modest residence at 755 Sand Point Road in Carpinteria, and construction of a new
substantially larger residence. The Project site is located on a narrow sand spit situated between the
environmentally sensitive and significant Carpinteria Slough and the Pacific Occan, making it
particularly vulnerable to coastal hazards from the south and fluvial hazards from the three coastal
10 watersheds to the north that empty into the Carpinteria Slough (aka "Carpinteria Salt Marsh" and "El
11 Estero"). The Project site is atypical among the other Sand Point Road properties in that it has an on-

12 site jurisdictional wetland immediately adjacent to the proposed Development Envelope, and contains

13 one of the few open space areas between the nearly continuous row of homes that offers a gap allowing

14 biological, and potentially hydrological connectivity between the ocean and the Carpinteria Slough.

15 Due to its size and length, Project development intrudes into minimum buffers designed to protect

16 wetlands and Environmentally Sensitive Habitat Areas (ESHA)s, and diminishes valuable open space

17 that connects marine and wetland habitats, resulting in potentially significant impacts to the

18 environment.

2.
19 The County acted contrary to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) in, inter alia,

20 adopting an MND for the Project when an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) is required due to the
existence of substantial evidence in the record supporting a fair argument that the Project may have
21

22 significant environmental impacts including in the areas of biological resources, water resources, and
land use.
23 3. Petitioners bring this Petition for Writ of Mandamus on their own behalf, and on behalf of the
24 general public under California Code of Civil Procedure §1094.5 and allege as follows:
25

26

27 PARTIES

15 state law.

16

17 STATEMENT OF FACTS
18

19 22. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 22 as if fully set forth herein.

20 23. The Project site, 755 Sand Point Road, is a 1.15-acre area located seaward of Sand Point Road in

21 Carpinteria, Santa Barbara County. The Project site is a portion of a 6.15-acre legal lot (APN 005-460-

22 043), which includes 5 acres north of Sand Point Road and within the Carpinteria Slough and 1.15

23 acres between the Slough and Pacific Ocean. The Property is currently developed with a 1,744 square

24 foot residence, which occupies the south east corner of the 1.15-acre Project site. The Project site
includes an
25 open space area between the existing residence and the neighboring residence to the west,

26 one of the few open spaces between the continuous row of homes along Sand Point Road.
24. The Project entails the demolition of an existing 1,774 square foot residence and the construction 27 of a new 5,995 gross q. ft. residence, to be built on top of a 5,800 gross sq. ft. of lower level storage
28
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

area, and attached garage (1,335 gross sq. ft.), and pool and hot tub (486 sq. ft.). The proposed

2 residence's roof ridges extend to a height of 30.8 ft, exceeding the allowed 28 feet maximum,

3 necessitating the approved Modification. Driveway access to the proposed residence would be widened

4 to 20 feet, a new fire hydrant would be installed in the Sandpoint Road right-of-way. The project entails

5 the addition of 5,990 square feet (.14 acres) of additional impervious surfaces on the site, an

6 approximate 66% increase, and proposes to limit additional surface runoff with a Tier 1 Stormwater
Control Plan.

25.
8 The Project site is located in a designated high flood hazard area, situated on a low-lying sand

9 spit that is particularly vulnerable to coastal hazards including coastal erosion, sea level rise, and storm

10 surges. The Project site includes two rock revetments that armor the sand spit, one of which pre-dated

11 the Coastal Act while the other was installed and both were subsequently cnhanced without the benefit
of permits. The unpermitted 1984 revetment and 1994 and 1998 maintenance projects have been
12 identified by Coastal Commission enforcement staff as Unpermitted Development installed and
13 maintained in violation of the Coastal Act that the County is reportedly "working" to address. The
14 Project site also abuts the Carpinteria Salt Marsh, subjecting the site to fluvial hazards including
15 flooding from the Salt Marsh side.
16 26. The 1.15 acre Project site contains a small on-site wetland south of Sand Point Road that is
17 hydrologically and biologically connected to the Carpinteria Slough and that qualifies both as a federal
18 and state jurisdictional wetland, and, like the Carpinteria Slough, is an ESHA protected by the County's

19 Local Coastal Program (LCP) and the Coastal Act. Project development proposed within the 100-foot

20 buffer established by the LCP to protect wetlands and ESHA includes: 1,409 square feet of the

21 proposed residence, 914 square feet of the driveway (in addition to the 790 square feet of existing

22 driveway within the area), 90 square feet of hardscape, 219 square feet of stairway, and 100 square feet

23 for fire hydrant, for a combined total permanent ground disturbance of 2,732 square feet

24 (approximately 0.062 acres), plus additional disturbance during construction.

25 27. The County prepared a draft MND dated June, 13 2017, which was revised and recirculated on

26 January 16, 2018, and again revised and finalized without recirculation on June 13, 2018. California

27 Coastal Commission staff submitted two sets of comments on the MNDs, identifying a number of

28 potentially significant environmental impacts and policy conflicts, and requesting, inter alia, increased
5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

setbacks from both the ocean and from the on-site jurisdictional wetland to avoid significant impacts

2 and achieve consistency with the LCP and Coastal Act as well as requesting consideration of a range of
m siting and design alternatives to minimize coastal hazards and avoid or minimize impacts to coastal

resources.

5 28. The County Zoning Administrator considered the Project including the MND, Coastal
Development Permit (CDP), and Modification to height regulations in the Coastal Zoning Ordinance

7 (CZO) to allow 146.65 sq. ft. of the proposed residence's roof ridges and peaks to extend above the

8 maximum allowed height, and approved it over the objections of Petitioners and others, and without
accommodating the Coastal Commission's requested setback increase from the on-site wetland and
without considering alternative project siting and designs that reduced the Project's impacts and coastal 10
hazard profile.
11 29. Petitioners appealed the Zoning Administrator's approval to the County Planning Commission, 12 which voted to deny the appeal and approve the Project and its MND. Petitioners then appealed the
13 Planning Commission's approval to the Board of Supervisors, which voted to deny the appeal and
14 approve the Project and its MND on August 28, 2018.
15 30. Respondents have abused their discretion and have failed to comply with the law in the
16 following ways:
17
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 18
(Violations of CEQA: Pub. Res. Code §§ 21000, et seq.) 19

20 31. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 30 as if fully set forth herein.
21 32. Respondents abused their discretion and failed to proceed in a manner required by CEQA by
22 adopting a MND for the Project in lieu of an EIR and approving the Project on that basis, despite the
23 existence of substantial evidence in the record supporting a fair argument of potentially significant

24 environmental impacts.

25 33. CEQA creates a low threshold requirement for preparation of an EIR, requiring that a public
26 agency prepare an EIR whenever substantial evidence supports a fair argument that a proposed project

27 may have a significant effect on the environment. (Public Resources Code § 21151). Significant effect

28 6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

on the environment means a substantial, or potentially substantial, adverse change in the environment.

2 (Public Resources Code § 21068).

3 34. The record before Respondents contains substantial evidence supporting a fair argument that the

4 Project may result in significant direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts to the environment including

5 impacts to wetlands, coastal watersheds, water quality, and to environmentally sensitive species and

6 their habitats.

7 35. Substantial evidence supporting a fair argument that the Project may result in significant direct,

8 indirect, and cumulative impacts to the on-site wetland, Carpinteria Slough, and sensitive biological

9 resources that rely on those habitats includes, inter alia, the detailed fact-based testimony of a

10 credentialed biologist, and written comments from Coastal Commission staff. This evidence

11 demonstrates that Project site biological resources were not properly identified or evaluated, and that
the MND did not adequately mitigate impacts to these resources including to endangered, threatened,
12 and special status species including the federally endangered Saltmarsh bird's beak (Cordylanthus
13 maritimus ssp. maritimus).
14 36. Substantial evidence supporting a fair argument that the Project may significantly impact coastal
15 watersheds and exacerbate flooding and crosion hazards includes, inter alia, the detailed fact-based
16 testimony of a credentialed coastal geomorphologist, and written comments from Coastal Commission
17 staff. This evidence demonstrates that coastal and fluvial hazards were not properly identified or
18 evaluated, and that the Project including its mitigation measures will exacerbate existing hazards, create

19 new hazards, and significantly impact coastal watersheds and habitat for sensitive species.

20 37. Substantial evidence also supports a fair argument that the Project may significantly impact

21 water quality. The project would result in the addition of 5,990 square feet (.14 acres) of additional

22 impervious surface, an approximate 66% increase which is more than twice the County's adopted

23 threshold of significance of a 25% increase for identifying significant impacts to water quality. The

24 detailed fact-based testimony of a credentialed biologist explains the inadequacy of proposed mitigation

25 including the Tier 1 Stormwater Control Plan to reduce this impact below significant levels.

26 38. The record before Respondents also contains substantial evidence supporting a fair argument that

27 the Project may result in significant land use impacts caused by the Project's inconsistency with

28 applicable policies in the County's Coastal Land Use Plan (CLUP), recognized as grounds for requiring
7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

an EIR (see The Pocket Protectors V. City of Sacramento (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 903, 930).

2 Supporting this fair argument are comments by Coastal Commission staff, and credentialed experts,

3 identifying inconsistencies between the Project and policies designed to protect the environment
including policies establishing minimum buffers around wetlands and ESHA policies protecting against

5 flood and erosion hazards, and policies protecting visual resources. Specifically, the Project is
inconsistent with CLUP Policies 2-11, 9-9, and Coastal Act sections 30231 and 30240 (incorporated by
reference into the LCP by CLUP Policy 1-1), because it fails to include adequate buffers and other
protective measures provided for in these policies and designed to prevent impacts to wetlands and
environmentally sensitive habitats. The Project is also inconsistent with CLUP Policies 3-11, 3-12, 3-

10 14, 3-19 because it develops open space that is unsuited for development due to known flood and

11 erosion hazards, contributes to flood hazards, and inadequately protects coastal watersheds from
pollution. The Project's excessive bulk and height is also inconsistent with CLUP Policy 4-4 and 12 Coastal Act section 30251 which protect public views to and along the coast and require that structures
13 conform with the scale of the existing community.
14

15 PRAYER FOR RELIEF
