1 INTRODUCTION
2 1. This action challenges the California Department of Transportation's
3 ("Caltrans") failure to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA")
4 in approving the Interstate 110 High Occupancy Toll Lanes Flyover Project (I-110
5 Flyover Project" or "Project").
6 2. The Project proposes to construct a 1,400-foot-long, 54-foot-high two-lane
7 flyover bridge structure that would take traffic from the I-110's toll lanes that currently
8 end at Adams Boulevard and relocate the end of these lanes, depositing traffic onto 23rd
9 Street and Figueroa Street.
10 3. In violation of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"),
11 Caltrans approved the I-110 Flyover Project based on a mitigated negative declaration
12 ("MND") instead of an environmental impact report ("EIR"), even though a fair
13 argument exists that the Project may have significant adverse impacts.
14 4. Expert evidence demonstrates that the Project's massive flyover structure
15 may have significant adverse impacts on the many historic resource located in the
16 University Park neighborhood. These historic resources include the National Register-
17 designated St. John's Church, which include the historic St. John's Cathedral and Parish
18 House. The flyover would be located adjacent to St. John's Church, resulting in impacts
19 to this historic resource, but also noise, vibration and air quality impacts to congregants.
20 5. The construction of elevated freeway structures has a long history of
21 dividing existing communities. If allowed to proceed as proposed, the I-110 Flyover
22 Project would continue that impactful and outdated practice. The historic University
23 Park community would be divided and severely impacted by the Project.
24 6. The Project also conflicts with the City of Los Angeles' My Figueroa Plan,
25 which is intended to redesign Figueroa Street as a complete street, with designated
26 bicycle lanes and a pedestrian-focus. The Project would dump many more vehicles onto
27 Figueroa Street, conflicting with the City-adopted design and plan for this street.
28 7. The Project would further result in potentially significant aesthetic, land use,

- PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

greenhouse gas, public service and traffic impacts that have not been adequately analyzed
2 or mitigated. Thus, Caltrans reliance on a MND a to approve the Project violates CEQA.
3 JURISDICTION
4 8. This Court has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1094.5 of the
5 Code of Civil Procedure and Public Resources Code section 21168.
6 9. This Court also has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1085 of
7 the Code of Civil Procedure, and section 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.
8 PARTIES
9 10. Petitioner West Adams Heritage Association ("WAHA") is a non-profit,
10 community-based organization comprised of over three hundred households in the West
11 Adams/University Park area, as well as others who support preservation of this
12 community's important architectural and cultural heritage. The specific purpose of
13 WAHA is to support preservation of the West Adams/University Park community's
14 architectural heritage and beautification activities and to educate Los Angeles' citizens
15 and others about cultural history and restoration techniques. WAHA routinely comments
16 on land use applications and environmental documents on behalf of its members in
17 furtherance of these stated goals.
18 11. Petitioner Adams Dockweiler Heritage Organizing Committee ("ADHOC*)
19 is a dba of an incorporated non-profit organization, the L.A. Stock Company, founded in 20 1980, and consisting of individual residents and property owners in the City of Los
21 Angeles. ADHOC is the theater in historic sites arm of the L.A. Stock Company and was
22 organized for the purpose of theater in historic sites education. ADHOC's further
23 purpose is to foster the designation and conservation of historic sites and landmarks.
24 Members of ADHOC participated in the administrative process.
25 12. Petitioner Friends of St. John's Cathedral (*Friends") is an unincorporated
26 association of individuals and groups who have a demonstrated interest and mutual
27 concern for the well-being of St. John's Cathedral and who seek to protect it from harm.
28 Members of the association include the No Flyover Coalition, congregants and rectors of

St. John's Cathedral and numerous others who participated in the administrative process.
2 Friends is alarmed at the severe and irreparable harm the "Flyover" would bring to the
3 Cathedral and its ability to carry on not only its mission, but also the impact to the
4 tranquil setting in which its mission occurs.
5 13. Respondent California Department of Transportation ("Caltrans") is an
6 agency of the State of California and is the designated lead agency for the environmental
7 review of the Project.
8 14. Respondents named Does 1 to 10 are given fictitious names because their
9 names and capacities are presently unknown to Petitioners.
10 15. Real Party in Interest Metropolitan Transportation Authority ("Metro") is a
11 state chartered regional transportation authority and will construct the proposed Project in
12 cooperation with Caltrans.
13 16. Real Parties in Interest named as Roes 1 to 10 are given fictitious names
14 because their names and capacities are presently unknown to Petitioners.
15 STATEMENT OF FACTS
16 History of Project and Project Site.
17 17. The current Project to construct a 1,400-foot-long, 55-foot-high two-lane
18 flyover bridge structure that would dump traffic onto 23rd Street and Figueroa Street was
19 first proposed in the late 1980s/early 1990s. There is a long history of opposition to the
20 Project and public rejection of this ill-conceived elevated flyover.
21 18. In 1990, Caltrans proposed terminating the high occupancy toll ("HOT")
22 lanes (then called high occupancy vehicle lanes ("HOV") as tolls had yet to be imposed)
23 at Figueroa Street and 23rd Street. A community meeting was held on May 8, 1990 by
24 Caltrans and the Community Redevelopment Agency to seek public comment on plan
25 to have traffic exit the I-110 HOV lanes via an elevated flyover at 23rd street in the heart
26 of historic University Park.
27 19. Numerous objections to the plan were lodged due to adverse impacts on the
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- historic neighborhood.
2 20. As a result of the May 8, 1990 public meeting, Caltrans recognized the
3 area's sensitive environment and significant community stakeholder opposition and
4 changed the terminus of the HOV lanes. The exit was moved southerly to 28th Street
5 where the Adams Boulevard exit now exists. This was known as Alternative A and
6 selected by Caltrans as the "preferred alternative." Caltrans and its (then) architectural
7 consultant Diane Kane determined that the I-110 Freeway exit should not be constructed
8 with a flyover, and the exit should be south of 23rd Street as it currently is constructed.
9 21. Since that time, even greater understanding of the historic neighborhood has
10 evolved. Many buildings have been formally recognized as historically significant and
11 listed on both local and national registers. In 1991, St. John's Episcopal Cathedral was
12 designated as a Los Angeles Historic Cultural Monument ("HCM*). Jim Childs, Chair of
13 Petitioner ADHOC, was the preservation consultant. In 2000, St. John's Cathedral was
14 listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
15 The Current Project and Administrative Process.
16 * ..
22. Consideration of a flyover ramp project at this site was resurrected in 2013
17 when Caltrans proposed essentially the same project it rejected due to its adverse
18 community impacts in the early 1990s. In the intervening years, the HOV lanes were
19 converted to. HOT lanes. This change now allows single occupant vehicles to use the
20 designated lanes with the payment of a toll, no longer restricting the lanes to only high
21 occupancy vehicles.
22 23. On January 28, 2013, 23 years after the 1990 community meeting, Caltrans
23 issued a "Notice of Scoping/Initiation of Studies for I-110 Transitway Connector Project"
24 ("NOP"). The NOP concluded, without any public input, that the Project "would
25 alleviate congestion and reduce queuing/delay on the Transitway and off ramp. This
26 could include construction of t flyover ramp to Figueroa Way."
27 24. The 2013 NOP stated, "your [the public's] input on pertinent environmental
28

4 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 issues, the project's purpose and need and range of alternatives, and related information
2 is being solicited. We want to hear your thoughts and welcome your participation." 3 25. It was commonly understood that the 2013 NOP was issued in anticipation
4 of the preparation of an EIR, not an MND. In fact, Caltrans initially sent the State
5 Clearinghouse a "Notice of Preparation of an EIR" only to later modify it to a request for
6 early consultation.
7 26. In response to the 2013 NOP solicitation, the University Park Historic
8 Preservation Overlay Zone Board (HPOZ), the North University Park Community
9 Association (NUPCA), St. John's Cathedral, Petitioner ADHOC, Petitioner WAHA and 10 others offered direction to the preparer and provided expert analysis and opinion
11 regarding the substantial negative impacts of a flyover scheme. The groups provided
12 guidance about the areas an EIR should address. The ADHOC letter noted, "This
13 proposal seems very similar to Alternative G from the 1991 FEIR which rejected all
14 proposed flyover options" and questioned the return of a widely-rejected idea.
15 27. Based on their experience in the early 1990s, many stakeholders expected
16 that, once made aware of the significant impacts which the NOP commenters provided to
17 Caltrans and which had only grown more significant in the intervening years, the Project
18 would be shelved and alternative solutions would be investigated. As WAHA iterated in
19 comments to Caltrans, "I look forward to working with you in furtherance of community
20 goals in finding suitable and environmentally sensitive ways to mitigate congestion while
21 preventing serious and irreparable environmental harm to our community."
22 28. Suggestions on the NOP were met with silence for over a year and a half,
23 with no contact nor information provided to any of the parties who commented on the
24 NOP.
25 29. On October 7, 2014, Caltrans contacted St. John's Cathedral and arranged a
26 "courtesy meeting." Caltrans staff briefed Fathers Dan Ade and Mark Kowalewski and
27 historic preservation consultant Jim Childs on the new plans for a flyover transitway from
28

5 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

the Adams Boulevard exit ramp to 23rd Street and Figueroa Way. St. John's Cathedral
2 representatives again raised the issue of the severe and irreparable negative impacts on St.
John's Cathedral and the University Park neighborhood and the absence of any public
4 outreach in the previous year and a half. St. John's representatives gave Caltrans a list of
NOP commenters and instilled the importance of public outreach to the environmental
6 I process.
7 30. None of the other NOP commenters were contacted.
8 31. After the St. John's "courtesy meeting," no further meetings were scheduled
9 by Caltrans. St. John's and WAHA scheduled an informational forum and community
10 meeting on December 3, 2014 and invited Caltrans and affected stakeholders.
11 32. This meeting was the first time many attendees ever heard of the proposed I-
12 110 Flyover Project. The lack of public awareness of the proposed Project was likely due
13 to the fact that the NOP was published only in the "Downtown News" and "La Opinion."
14 The NOP was not published in any English language publication of wide circulation in
15 University Park.
16 33. At the December 3, 2014 informational forum, Caltrans revealed: the Project
17 would slice only seconds off cars' waiting time at the selective intersections studied; that
18 Caltrans was not seeking to increase capacity, a statement they later reversed; and the
19 cost estimate for the Project was $43 million. Caltrans staff stated that the Project was in
20 the very beginning planning stages. so there were no visuals available.
21 34. Numerous concerns were raised at the meeting regarding impacts to historic
22 resources and the University Park community. One attendee discussed the problem of
23 induced demand: studies show that increasing capacity in one mode of transportation to
24 alleviate crowding simply results in more people using that mode of transportation.
25 Thus, the Project would likely increase, not decrease, vehicular traffic. Attendees urged
26 Caltrans to instead consider improvements to and development of different modalities
27 (carpools, busses, metro trains), instead of increasing ease of use on freeways.

2 The meeting adjourned with Metro's suggestion of subsequent meetings.

3 No later community or informational meetings were held by Caltrans prior to the release

4 of an environmental review document for the Project, which declared Caltrans' intent to

5 move forward with the flyover proposal instead of considering multi-modal alternatives.
36.

6 The Project is not fully-funded. In the past, Caltrans received $7.4 million

7 from the federal government toward an environmental study for a project to improve

8 traffic congestion at the I-110 Adams Boulevard exit. If the project moves forward, more

9 funding would need to be found, from sources such as the issuance of a bond measure
the use of revenue from toll lanes. or

10 37.
11 In assuming Federal Highway Administration responsibilities for this

12 Project, Caltrans was required engage in consultation with "consulting parties" regarding

13 the historic impacts of the Project pursuant to Section 106 of the National Historic

14 Preservation Act (NHPA). The Los Angeles Conservancy sought to become a

15 "consulting party." The community was hopeful that with continued dialogue, Caltrans

16 would withdraw the flawed flyover proposal and develop a less impactful alternative.
38.
17 On February 3, 2015, Petitioner WAHA also requested status as a

18 "consulting party" under Section 106 of the NHPA, pursuant to 36 C.F.R. § 800.2(c)(5).

19 WAHA's request discussed the Project's likelihood of causing significant impacts to the

20 large number of historic resources adjacent to and near the Project site. Thus, the Project

21 would potentially result in adverse effects to historic resources. Likely affected historic

22 resources include, but are not limited to St. John's Cathedral, St. Vincent's Cathedral, the

23 Automobile Club of Southern California, the Chester Place Historic District, the

24 University Park Historic Preservation Overlay Zone, the St. James Park National Register

25 District, the Twentieth Street National Register District, the Woolen Mills Zanja, and the
Stimson Mansion.
26 39.
27 St. John's Cathedral and the California Preservation Foundation also

28 requested to participate actively in the review process, as consulting parties. All four

1:20 1 .

1 requests were granted.
2 40.
3 One of the seminal issues at the onset of the Section 106 process was

4 defining the Area of Potential Effects (APE). WAHA strongly objected to the original

5 Caltrans-defined APE, which was limited to the eastern side of Figueroa Street. The APE

6 was ultimately extended to both sides of Figueroa.
41.
7 On April 22, 2015, Caltrans held a consulting party meeting to discuss the

8 design of the flyover. Materials were distributed for comment. No one outside of

9 Caltrans found any of the designs acceptable. Consulting parties suggested that Caltrans

10 consider alternatives that satisfy the Project's purpose and need, including surface route

11 options that could address congestion without the impactful flyover. To date, no "context

12 sensitive solution" has been considered by Caltrans.
42.
13 In August 2015, during the Section 106 process, Caltrans made a "Finding

14 of Adverse Effect" (FAE). In the FAE, Caltrans acknowledged that St. John's Episcopal

15 Cathedral and St. John's Parish House are historic properties for which the proposed

16 Project would introduce visual elements that would be out of character and result in
adverse effects.
17 43.
18 On November 23, 2015, Caltrans' Cultural Resources Unit found that

19 mitigation measures would not reduce effects below a level of significance, so "an impact
on
20 4(f) resources will result from the project." A 4(f) resource is a resource considered

21 historic under the Federal Transportation Act. All alternatives and mitigation measures

22 that would reduce or eliminate impacts to 4(f) resources must be adopted if feasible.
44.
23 On January 25, 2016, stakeholders learned Caltrans would not prepare the

24 anticipated EIR for the Project. To the surprise of Petitioners and many others, Caltrans

25 issued a notice stating its intent to adopt a MND and Finding of No Significant Effect

26 (FONSI) for the Project. This ran contrary to their previously adopted FAE.
45.
27 On February 13, 2016, Caltrans corrected their notice to the State

28 Clearinghouse that they were issuing a Notice of Preparation of an EIR, changing it to a

8
• PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 request for an early consultation; it appears that at one time there was an expectation by
2 some at Caltrans that an EIR was being prepared rather than an MND.
3 46. On February 23, 2016, the Project's sole public hearing was held at the
4 Orthopaedic Hospital. Over 100 people attended. Of the forty members of the public
5 who chose to speak, 38 voiced their strong opposition to the Project. The testimony
6 included expert analysis as well as community observations that supported the rejection
7 of the Project and rejection of Caltrans' use of an MND/FONSI instead of an EIR/EIS.
8 Gil Cedillos's Council District office and Curren Price's Council District 9 office, the
9 North Area Neighborhood Development Council, the National Trust for Historic
10 Preservation, the Los Angeles Conservancy, historic preservation consultants, traffic
11 experts, environmental planners, attorneys, the Petitioners, members of the St. John's
12 Congregation and many other members of the public appeared at the hearing and
13 provided fact-based as well as observational information about the Project's unmitigated
14 adverse impacts.
15 47. On March 24, 2016, the City of Los Angeles submitted comments
16 supporting request made by Petitioners for Caltrans' to prepare a full EIR/EIS.
17 48. Although Caltrans' emails admit an EIR could have been prepared "without
18 too much impact to the schedule," Caltrans dismissed the substantive testimony and
19 indicated it would adopt the MND/FONSI.
20 49. Caltrans argued that because mitigation measures have been adopted, the
21 Project will not have significant impacts. For example, Caltrans found the Project would
22 have a significant impact on St. John's Church, but assumes that a memorandum of
23 agreement (MOA) with the State Office of Historic Preservation, which at that time yet to
24 be completed, would a mitigate these impacts to a less than significant level. None of the
25 consulting parties, including St. John's Cathedral, agreed. The mitigation measures
26 proposed for the MOA would not affect the Project's visual intrusion into the setting of
27 St. John's buildings. Additionally, because the MOA has not yet been drafted, any
28

9 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 mitigation for these impacts would be impermissibly deferred. Moreover, because
2 Caltrans was unwilling to consider project alternatives other than elevated transitways the
3 significant impacts to St. John's could not be mitigated to a less than significant level.
4 50. A consulting parties mitigation meeting was held January 31, 2018. There,
5 the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission requested that Caltrans meet with its
6 commissioners, who are experts in preservation and stewards of the City Historic
7 Cultural Monuments. Caltrans rejected the Commission's request.
8 51. At the January 31, 2018 meeting, Caltrans staff disclosed that Project costs
9 had increased to $100 million.
10 52. Caltrans' continued dismissal, throughout the proposed MND/FONSI
11 document, of the severe environmental impacts of a 54-foot-high concrete massive
12 flyway because the site is an "urban" area, ignoring the complexity of the setting,
13 including the wealth of nearby historic resources, community character, and many nearby
14 sensitive receptors, such as the Orthopaedic Hospital, the New Designs Charter School,
15 and the many residents in the University Park neighborhood. From the Project's inception
16 in 2010, Caltrans has denied any need for a context sensitive solution.
17 53. On April 5. 2018, Caltrans and the State Historic Preservation Officer
18 (SHPO) executed a Memorandum of Agreement; all of the consulting parties rejected the
19 terms and declined to sign the agreement due to its failure to fully mitigate historic
20 resource impacts.
21 54. On April 24, 2018, Caltrans determined the Project would not have a
22 significant effect on the environment and that an MND would be adopted.
23 55. Caltrans mailed a copy of the "Notice of Availability Mitigated Negative
24 Declaration (MND)/Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI)* on April 30, 2018 to
25 Agencies, Organization and Individual Interested in the I-110 High Occupancy Toll Lane
26 Flyover Project.

11 Petitioners have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of

12 ordinary law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate and injunctive relief.

13 In the absence of such remedies, Caltrans' approval of the Project would form the basis

24 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

25 (VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT)
63.
26 64. Petitioners incorporate all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.

27 CEQA prohibits lead agency from approving a project that may have a

28 significant impact on the environment without first preparing, considering, and certifying
an EIR. Caltrans violated CEQA by adopting an MND for the Project, despite substantial

11 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

+-ge

evidence supporting a fair argument that the project may have a significant impact on the
2 I environment.
3 65. The purpose of the initial study is to provide the lead agency with adequate
4 information regarding a project to determine the appropriate environmental review
document and "documentation of the factual basis for the finding in a negative
6 declaration that project will not have a significant effect on the environment." (Ctr. for
7 Sierra Nevada Conservation v. County of El Dorado (2012) 202 Cal. App. 4th 1156,
8 1170, citations omitted.) There must be a basis within the record to support the
9 conclusions reached by the initial study. (Lighthouse Field Beach Rescue v. City of Santa
10 Cruz (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 1170, 1201.) "Where an agency. . . fails to gather
11 information and undertake an adequate environmental analysis in its initial study, a
12 negative declaration is inappropriate." (El Dorado County Taxpayers for Quality Growth
13 V. County of El Dorado (2004) 122 Cal. App. 4th 1591, 1597, citations omitted.)
14 66. There is substantial evidence in the record to support a fair argument that the
15 project may have significant project level and cumulative adverse effects on the
16 environment, including, but not limited to, the following impacts:
17 a. Historic Resource Impacts
18 67. CEQA requires careful consideration of a project's impacts on historic
19 resources, including impacts to the setting of historic resources. (Pub. Resources Code §
20 21084.1.)
21 68. Expert evidence was submitted to Caltrans, identifying that the Project
22 would have significant impacts on historic resources. If there is disagreement among
23 expert opinion supported by facts over the significance of an effect on the environment,
24 the Lead Agency shall treat the effect as significant and shall prepare an EIR." (CEQA
25 Guidelines § 15064 (g).)
26 69. The impacts identified by experts included impacts on the historic
27 University Park section of the West Adams neighborhood. The massive flyover structure
28

12 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

AFOtes

would dominate and overpower the visual landscape for this historic area. The MND
2 failed to address impacts to the many designated historic resources located in this
3 neighborhood, such as the Automobile Club of Southern California, St. Vincent de Paul
4 Church, the Stimson House, the Slauson House, the Woolen Mills Zanja and the Chester
5 Place National Register District.
6 70. The Project would intrude into a neighborhood full of historic resources and
7 adversely impact the setting of these important resources. It would also bring sources of
8 / pollution closer to historic resources that contain important artifacts, resulting in
9 potentially significant damage.
10 71. The MND acknowledge the Project would have significant adverse impacts
11 on the National Register-listed St. John's Cathedral, although failed to fully analyze the
12 extent of those impacts. The MND included a short list of wholly inadequate measures
13 that Caltrans admitted would not fully mitigate the significant impacts. Historic resource 14 experts and other members of the community commented on the inadequacy, improper
15 deferred nature and unenforceability of the mitigation measures, making them inadequate
16 under CEQA's requirements.
17 72. An EIR should have been prepared to analyze the significant historic 18 resource impacts and to evaluate alternatives and mitigation measures to address those
19 impacts.
20 b. Aesthetic Impacts
21 73. It is well settled that "[a] project that interferes with scenic views has an
22 adverse aesthetic effect on the environment." (Bowman v. City of Berkeley (2004) 122
23 Cal.App.4th 572, 586.)
24 74. The MND fails analyze the Project's significant impacts on views of the
25 historic St. Vincent's Church for the many commuters on the I-110. The flyover would 26 obscure valued public views of this resource.
27 75. The MND also fails to disclose the Project's impacts on west-facing views
28

of historic resources from West Adams Boulevard east of the I-110.
2 76. Nighttime lighting impacts from the many cars using the flyover ramp may
3 also be significant and remain unaddressed.
4 C. Land Use Impacts
5 77. CEQA requires an analysis of a project's inconsistencies with existing land
6 use plans. (CEQA Guidelines § 15063(d)(5).) If substantial evidence supports a fair
7 argument that a proposed project conflicts with the policies included in existing land use
8 plans, "this constitutes grounds for requiring an EIR. Whether a fair argument can be
9 made on this point is a legal question on which [courts] do not defer to the City Council's
10 determination." (Pocket Protectors v. City Of Sacramento (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 903,
11 930.)
12 78. As detailed by two Los Angeles City Councilmembers, the Project would
13 conflict with the City's My Figueroa Plan ("MyFig Plan") for Figueroa Street. The
14 MyFig Plan was designed to turn Figueroa Street into the first complete, multi-modal
15 street, with dedicated bike lanes and enhanced pedestrian amenities to complement the
16 many mass transit alternatives that serve the area.
17 79. The Project is a complete reversal of the multi-modal goals established by
18 the MyFig Plan. It would dump numerous new vehicles onto Figueroa Street and would
19 require a complete redesign of the City's carefully planned vision for this street.
20 80. The MND fails to disclose the Project's inconsistency with the MyFig Plan.
21 Instead, it defers true analysis to after Project approval, claiming Caltrans will work with
22 the City to design the Project and Figueroa Street.
23 81. The MND also fails to disclose the Project's inconsistency with the City of
24 Los Angeles' General Plan's policies and goals intended to promote alternative
25 transportation and to protect residents, community character and historic resources.
26 82. An EIR is required to analyze all of these land use policy inconsistencies.
27 83. There is also a fair argument supported by substantial evidence that the
28

14 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

•, P : - •-0*

:N

1 Project may have land use impacts due to the physical barrier that will divide the existing
2 community east and west of the flyover ramp. The flyover would serve as a barrier to
3 pedestrians due to legitimate safety concerns and noise impacts while walking under the
4 flyover. There is a long history of negative community impacts resulting for the division
5 caused by the construction of freeways, particularly in lower income neighborhoods such
6 as this. These impacts, including the environmental justice issues, were not fully
7 analyzed or mitigated.
8 84. The MND further failed to analyze the Project's potential urban decay
9 impact. Businesses along West Adams would be less desirable due to the overshadowing
10 flyover. The Project would also shut down Figueroa Way to vehicular traffic reducing 11 access and visibility; the impacts of this change on businesses along Figueroa Way must
12 be evaluated.
13 d. Air Quality and Greenhouse Gas Impacts
14 85. The South Coast Air Quality Management District ("SCAQMD") submitted
15 comments finding that the Project construction emissions would exceed regional
16 construction emission significance thresholds. This was found to be particularly
17 problematic due to the Project's proximity to sensitive land uses, including a school and a 18 hospital.
19 86. The SCAQMD proposed mitigation measures to reduce these impacts, but
20 the measures were not adopted by Caltrans.
21 87. The SCAQMD also found the MND failed to analyze the Project's localized
22 air quality impacts.
23 88. The MND acknowledges that the Project would increase capacity, and thus
24 increase traffic volumes. The MND fails to adequately address the impacts associated
25 with this increase in vehicle miles traveled and the associated increases in air pollution
26 and greenhouse gas emissions. It also fails to address the health impacts the surrounding
27 community would experience due to the increase in air pollution and bringing it closer to
28

15 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

eh ter
*:- 901-41:57 90:

P residents and other sensitive receptors.
2 89. The MND acknowledges an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, but
3 instead of determining whether this impact would be significant, the MND merely
4 concludes the impact is too speculative.
5 90. CEQA requires an analysis of this potentially significant impact and the
6 consideration of mitigation measures to reduce it to a less than significant level. Instead,
7 the MND identifies deferred and unenforceable mitigation measures that could
8 potentially reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
9 e. Noise and Vibration Impacts
10 91. The MND found the Project would increase noise impacts at the adjacent
11 Orthopaedic Institute for Children hospital, resulting in noise levels above significance
12 levels. The MND fails to provide mitigation to address this significant noise impact.
13 92. Noise impacts at St. John's Cathedral would also be significantly adverse.
14 The flyover structure would not only increase traffic levels, but would also elevate and
15 bring traffic noise and hazardous vibrations much closer to the Cathedral. This increase
16 in traffic noise would have significant impacts on services and other activities at St.
17 John's Cathedral that have not been mitigated. It will make outdoor events at St. John's
18 Cathedral nearly impossible. The vibrations could also damage this historic resource.
19 93. The New Designs Charter School is located at the corner of Figueroa Street
20 and 23rd Street. The Project's increase in noise levels would adversely impacts students
21 at this school. The MND fails to adequately analyze or mitigate this impact.
22 f. Public Services
23 94. As has been experienced by Petitioners and other members of the
24 community, the construction of a flyover structure becomes a nuisance for the
25 community below by attracting crime to the area below the flyover.
26 95. This has been the personal experience of Petitioners and other community
27 members with the construction of a similar flyover structure along Flower Drive, south of
28

the Project site.
2 96. The MND has failed to address the public safety impacts associated with the
3 Project and the associated need for increased police and other emergency services.
4 g. Traffic Impacts
5 97. Instead of alleviating traffic congestion as it claims, the it Project would
6 increase traffic capacity and levels and deliver that traffic a to a new location.
7 98. Figueroa Street is being converted to a complete street with a focus on
8 bicyclists and pedestrians over vehicle traffic. The Project is contrary to that plan by
9 dumping numerous new vehicle trips onto the street. The MND fails to adequately 10 analyze the impacts of the Project on pedestrians and bicyclists.
11 99. The Project may also adversely impact transit by eliminating a Silver Line
12 bus stop.
13 100. A traffic expert engaged by Petitioner WAHA found that the Project would
14 have significant adverse traffic impacts on Figueroa Street that required mitigation.
15 101. The MND fails to analyze the cut-through traffic impacts the University
16 Park neighborhood.
17 102. The MND also fails to analyze traffic impacts on 23rd Street between
18 Hoover Street to the west and Grand Avenue to the east.
19 103. As numerous studies, including those by Caltrans have shown, increasing
20 capacity does not reduce traffic impacts. Instead, it induces more traffic and often
21 increases traffic congestion. The MND fails to address this impact, which would be
22 created by the Project's increase in traffic capacity.
