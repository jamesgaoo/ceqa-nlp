VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

9. Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the State of California

2 in and for the County of EI Dorado pursuant to section 394 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
0 A w BACKGROUND FACTS

10. The Project site is located on Assessor's Parcel Numbers 121-290-60, 121-290-61
and 121-290-62 on the northwest corner of Town Center Boulevard and Vine Street within the
El Dorado Hills Town Center East Commercial Center in the El Dorado Hills area in EI
A c Dorado County.

I1. The Project is a 214-unit apartment complex in the Town Center Ease ("TCE")

O Planned Development Area of El Dorado Hills, within the TCE Commercial Development Plan

I0 area. The Commercial Development Plan was a approved for a total of 925,000 square feet of

[1 commercial center and a 150-room hotel in August of 1995. The TCE is within the Village T

12 area of the El Dorado Hills Specific Plan ("EDHSP"), a master planned community that was
13 approved in July 1988. The TCE was not designated for any residential use.

14 12. The TCE has developed with commercial uses, including movie theater, grocery
15 store, and several retail stores. The Project site has remained vacant, although a portion of the

16 site (APNs 121-290-61 and 62) was designated for a hotel in 2008 and APN 121290-60 was

17 identified for potential retail sops with a maximum floor area of 10,000 square feet.

18 13. Previously, on December 2, 2014, the Board of Supervisors approved a 250-unit

19 apartment complex at the subject site for the same applicant (*2014 Project"), with an Initial

20 Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration ("IS/MND"). The 2014 Project proposal was similar to

21 the Project that is the subject of this Petition, except the quantity of residential units has been

22 reduced from 250 to 214. The previous project was approved by the Board of Supervisors with

23 the IS/MND and was purportedly tiered from the previous CEQA negative declaration for the

24 TCE Development Plan approved in August 1995.

25 14. Approval of the 2014 Project was challenged in the EI Dorado County Superior

26 Court, Case No. PC20150001, and the Court granted the writ directing the County to set aside

27 the project approval finding that a full EIR was required for the project. Spanos appealed the

28 decision and the matter is pending at the Third District Court of Appeal, Case No. C081472.
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- 15. The current Project has been identified by the County as an "alternati ve" to the ...

N previous project. At the Board of Supervisors hearing on the Project, County Counsel
explained to the decision makers and the public that the entitlements for the 2014 Project
T1o 3 would not be rescinded, but would remain in place unless the applicant requested rescission or
there is a legal judgment ordering rescission.

16. The County General Plan now includes 2014 amendment allowing a "site
specific" increase in the maximum residential density from 24 dwelling units per acre to 55

8 dwelling units per acre. The General Plan also includes an amendment for the same site for the

0 current Project allowing for 47 dwelling units per acre. The El Dorado Hills Specific Plan

10 includes a similar set of conflicting amendments, and so does the Town Center East
Development Plan.
12 17. The 2014 Project included (l) a General Plan Amendment adding a new policy
13 under Objective 2.2.6 (Site Specific Policy Section) increasing the maximum residential

14 density allowed in the General Plan from 24 dwelling units/acre to a maximum of 55 dwelling

15 units/acre for the 4.565-acre site within the Town Center East Planned Development area

16 identified as Assessor's Parcel Numbers 121-290-60, 121-290-61 and 121-290-62); (2) El

17 Dorado Hills Specific Plan Amendment incorporating multi-family residential use, density, and

18 related standards for the Project site; (3) Rezone of the Project site from General Commercial-

19 Planned Development (CG-PD) to Multifamily Residential-Planned Development (RM-PD)

20 and revision to the R.M-zone district development standards to modified standards and added

21 guidelines applicable to the proposed 250-unit apartment complex; and (4) Revision of the

22 approved Town Center East Development Plan incorporating multifamily residential use,

23 density, and related design and development standards for the proposed 250-unit apartment

24 complex within Planning Area 2 of the Town Center East Development Plan.

25 18. The above-described entitlements are, according to the County, still in place as an

26 "alternative" for the applicant.

27 19. The current Project includes the following: (l) a General Plan Amendment adding

28 a new policy under Objective 2.2.6.6 (Site Specific Policy Section) increasing the maximum
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 5

residential density allowed in the General Plan from 24 dwelling units/acre to a maximum of
NOUP0 N 47 dwelling units/acre (instead of the 55 units/acre approved for the 2014 Project) for the
4.565-acre site within the Town Center East Planned Development area identified as
Assessor's Parcel Numbers 121-290-60, 121-290-61 and 121-290-62); (2) El Dorado Hills
Specific Plan Amendment incorporating multi-family residential use, density, and related
standards for the Project site, with density numbers modified for the current Project; (3)
Rezone of the Project site from General Commercial-Planned Development (CG-PD) to
cc Multifamily Residential-Planned Development (RM-PD) and revision to the RM-zone district

9 development standards, to modified standards and added guidelines, applicable to the proposed

10 214-unit apartment complex; and (4) Revision of the approved Town Center East Development

11 Plan incorporating multifamily residential use, density, and related design and development

12 standards and guidelines for for the proposed 214-unit apartment complex within Planning

13 Area 2 of the Town Center East Development Plan.

[4 20. On June 20, 2017, the El Dorado County Planning Department released for public

15 review and comment a Draft EIR ("DEIR") for the Project. The public comment and review

- ... 16 closed on August 30, 2017. Various State and local agencies and members of the public

17 submitted written and oral comments on the DEIR.

18 21. The EI Dorado Hills Area Planning Advisory Committee ("APAC") reviewed the

19 proposed Project and submitted comments to the County. The APAC raised concerns about

20 traffic impacts, the doubling of the current maximum multifamily residential density, and the

21 potential loss of sales tax revenue. APAC voted 7-0 in favor of non-support of the Project on

22 the grounds that the County had not adequately analyzed and mitigated Project impacts, and

23 that the Project is inconsistent with the Specific Plan, the El Dorado County General Plan, the

24 El Dorado Hills Town Center East Development Plan, and the El Dorado Hills Town Center

# 25 East Design Standards.

26 22. On January 11,2018, the El Dorado County Planning Commission voted 3-2 to

27 recommend that the Board of Supervisors approve the Project.

6 28
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

H 23. On February 13,2018, El Dorado County, through the El Dorado County Board

IMAWN of Supervisors, voted 4-1 in favor of certifying the EIR and approving the Project.

24. On February 15,2018, Respondents filed a Notice of Determination with the
County Clerk of El Dorado County as provided for in Public Resources Code, section 21152.
EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES
AND INADEQUACY OF REMEDY

25. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant

dQ action and has exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required

Q a by law.

10 26. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code, section
21167.5 by mailing written notice of this action to the Respondents. A copy of this written
12 notice and proof of service are attached as Exhibit A to this Petition for Writ of Mandate.
13 27. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.6 by

14 concurrently filing a request concerning preparation of the record of administrative

15 proceedings relating to this action.

16 28. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

17 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside their

18 approval of the Project and adoption of the Mitigated Negative Declaration. In the absence of

19 such remedies, Respondents' approval will remain in effect in violation of State law.

20 29. This action has been brought within 30 days of the filing of the Notice of

21 Determination as required by Public Resources Code section 21167(c).

22 STANDING

23 30. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because

24 Petitioner's aesthetic and environmental interests are directly and adversely affected by

25 Respondents' approval of the Mitigated Negative Declaration and approval of the Project.

26 ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS ACTIONS

27 31. Petitioner brings this action on the basis, among others, of Government Code

28 section 800, and other applicable laws, which award Petitioners' attorneys' fees in actions to

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 7

1 overturn agency decisions that are arbitrary and capricious, such as the decisions here in

2 question,
uAu FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
Abuse of Discretion
CEQA, Public Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.
32. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein, as if set forth in fuil, each and every
allegation contained in paragraphs I through 31 of this petition and further alleges as follows: M o 33. Respondents have abused their discretion and failed to act in the manner required
under CEQA with respect to the Project because they have failed to adequately analyze its

9 environmental impacts and necessary or feasible mitigation measures with respect to
10 transportation/traffic and land use.
11 34. Traffic Impacts. The Project will have significant traffic impacts. The EIR
12 acknowledges that the Project will have significant impacts, and then relies upon inadequate
13 mitigation measures to conclude that the impacts will be mitigated to a level of insignificance.
14 Also, the traffic demand model used by the County is deeply flawed, and these flaws were
15 pointed out in public comments submitted prior to Project approval. Assumptions and
16 conclusions regarding LOS and cumulative impacts were also in error.
[7 35. The County attempted to avoid imposing mitigation measures on the applicant by
18 asserting that the Project's impacts on private intersections could not be considered (because
19 the General Plan LOS requirements could not be imposed on a private roadway), but all of the
20 Project's traffic impacts must be considered under CEQA. The poor LOS that will result from
21 the Project at the private intersection will have impacts on public roads near the Project and
22 will impact the community as a result a of the extreme congestion within Town Center. The
23 APAC pointed this out to the County, but the concern was dismissed.
24 36. The cumulative traffic Impacts analysis for the Project failed to include all
25 relevant past, present, and future projects.
26 37. The County failed to mitigate the Project's cumulative negative impacts to
27 Latrobe Road and White Rock Road intersection, claiming that the Impacts were negative, but
28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 8

P

NOGA0N did not violate the General Plan's prohibition on reaching LOS F, and so this somehow
relieved the applicant from having to mitigate these significant negative impacts.

38. The County repeatedly asserted that the Project's consistency with General Plan
Policies regarding traffic impacts was "not a CEQA issue," and then applied the Level of
Service ("LOS") standards from the General Plan as the CEQA threshold of significance. The
use of this as a threshold was in error, and resulted in the County ignoring substantial evidence

8 of significant traffic impacts. The existence of a General Plan standard is not sound basis for

O ignoring significant impacts that do not rise to the level of violating the standard. The

10 County's finding of less than significant traffic impacts is not supported by substantial

evidence.

11 39.

12 The APAC voted unanimously not to support the Project, and traffic impacts

13 a played a role in their decision. Compliance with a regulatory requirement (in this case not

14 falling to LOS F) cannot foreclose consideration of substantial evidence showing a significant

15 environmental impact. The APAC urged the County to address the significant traffic impacts,

but these concerns were also dismissed.

16 40.

17 Land Use. The Project will have a significant impact to land use as the Project

18 changes land use designations and zoning, and does so in a way that conflicts with the adjacent

19 land uses, existing infrastructure and roadway systems. The Project conflicts with the Specific

20 Plan, the El Dorado County General Plan, the El Dorado Hills Town Center East Development

21 Plan, and the El Dorado Hills Town Center East Design Standards. The density of the Project

22 is more than double the maximum allowed under the General Plan. The County's conclusion

23 that the Project's impacts to land use would be less than significant is not supported by
substantial evidence.

24 41.

25 The Project required a wholesale revision of the TCE Planned Development

26 standards. The setback, height and design requirements that applied to all other projects within

27 the Specific Plan were also ignored and replaced for the Project in order to accommodate the

28 extraordinary density. The Project is inconsistent will all applicable land use plans such that
the amendments approved as part of the Project essentially created exceptions to the limits
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 9

NOA0N imposed on all other projects in the County in order to allow for the enormous apartment
building that was never anticipated by any member of the community.

42.

use The Project will impact adjacent land uses because it does not fit within the land
plans applicable to all other development in the area. Further, approval of the Project
coupled with a conclusion that such an extreme deviation from the applicable planning

8 documents will have an insignificant impact will open the door to future "exemptions" to land
use plans in El Dorado County. If the County can exempt a project from all applicable land

9 a use plans on a case-by-case basis and successfully claim that it has no significant impact, then

0= 5 there is nothing to prevent the County from providing future exemptions to other developers.
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

43. Violation of General Plan Laws - Government Code §§ 65300 et seq.; Code of Civil Procedure 1085

44.

14 Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 42.

15 Government Code section 65300.5 requires Respondent County of El Dorado to

16 ensure that "the general plan and elements and parts thereof comprise an integrated, internally
consistent and compatible statement of policies for the adopting agency."

45.

17 In adopting the General Plan amendments as part of the subject Project,

18 Respondents violated Government Code section 65300.5 in that it rendered its own general

19

20 plan internally inconsistent. The Project is inconsistent with the applicable Specific Plan, the

21 El Dorado County General Plan, the EI Dorado Hills Town Center East Development Plan, and
the El Dorado Hills Town Center East Design Standards.

46.

22

23 Adoption of a general plan is a legislative act reviewable under section 1085 of the
Code of Civil Procedure. (Government Code section 65301.5.) At all times herein,

24

25 Respondent has had the ability to comply with the Government Code. Respondent's adoption

26 of amendments to the Specific Plan, the El Dorado County General Plan, the El Dorado Hills

27 Town Center East Development Plan, and the El Dorado Hills Town Center East Design

28 Standards as part of the Project was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, a failure to
proceed by law, and renders the general plan internally inconsistent, and void.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 10

47. The findings adopted by the Board of Supervisors acknowledge that the Project
approval "exceeds the maximum density" allowed by the General Plan.
MT 1OA 48. Public comments raised the issue of the Project's inconsistency with General Plan
policies governing traffic levels of service, public services, density and other policies, and

these concerns were not addressed.

49. The Project is in conflict with the applicable Specific Plan, the El Dorado County
General Plan, the El Dorado Hills Town Center East Development Plan, and the El Dorado

8 Hills Town Center East Design Standards. It is also in violation of the 2016 voter-approved
a Measure E. General Plan Policy TC-Xa-1 requires that "[t]raffic from residential development

10 projects of five or more units or parcels of land shall not result in, or worsen, Level of Service

L1 F (gridlock, stop-and-go) traffic congestion during weekday, peak-hour periods on any

12 highway, road, interchange or intersection in the unincorporated areas of the County."
13 50. The EIR states that one of the Project's objectives is to "[i Implement the goals

14 and objectives of the EI Dorado Hills Specific Plan," and yet, the basic provisions of the

15 Specific Plan and the TCE Development Plan have been gutted by amendment for the purposes

16 of issuing entitlements for the Project.

17 51. The Project is inconsistent with the objectives of the Economic Element of the

18 General Plan, including the following: Business Retention and Expansion (Objective 10.1.5),

19 Capture of Retail and Tourism Dollars (Objective 10.1.6), Jobs-Housing Relationship given

20 that according to the County's records El Dorado County is lacking approximately 40,000 jobs

21 in relationship to housing (Objective 10.1.9).

22 52. No substantial evidence supported the County's conclusion that the Project does

23 not conflict with any applicable land use plan. The record shows that the Project is in direct

24 conflict with existing land use plans and inconsistent with adjacent uses.

25 53. Approval of the zoning change and modified standards and added guidelines

26 required by the Project also violate the State General Plan Laws. Revisions to the Town

27 Center East Development Plan are inconsistent with General Plan policies limiting density to

11 28 16 units per acre for mixed-use developments and 24 units per acre for multifamily
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- developments. The Project approval also included amendments contrary to the existing
2 standards of a Multifamily Residential zone regarding minimum setbacks, maximum building
height, and building coverage.

NO u. 54. In addition to the Project being inconsistent with the General Plan, the actions of
the County in approving the Project and not rescinding the amendments and zoning changes
approved for the 2014 Project, created internal inconsistency. There are two layers of
amendment for the same parcels, amendments for the 2014 Project and new amendments for
oc the current Project, and they are not consistent with one another. For example, the Specific

9 Plan and the General Plan now each include two amendments; one providing for a "site

L0 specific" density of 55 dwelling units per acre and another providing for 47 dwelling units per

11 acre. These conflicting amendments apply to the same parcels.
12 55. The internal inconsistency in the applicable land use plans began with the 2014
13 Project and has been exacerbated by the layering on of an additional set of amendments, also
14 inconsistent with the relevant land us plans, and inconsistent with one another.
15 PRAYER
16 Wherefore, Petitioners respectfully request the following relief and entry of judgment as
17 follows:

18 1. A peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents to vacate and set aside the

19 approval of the Environmental Impact Report prepared for the Project on the grounds that it
20 violates the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000 et

21 seq. and Government Code section 65300 et seq.
22 (a) Withdraw the Notice of Determination for the Project;
GE (b) Prepare, circulate and consider a new legally adequate environmental review for
the Project;
25 (c) Suspend all activity that could result in any change or alteration to the physical
26 environment until Respondents have taken such actions as may be necessary tO

27 bring its determination, findings or decision regarding the Project into compliance

28 with CEQA;

- 2. Petitioners' attorneys' fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 and

N other applicable authority;
