INTRODUCTION 23

24 In this action petitioner NORTH TUSTIN COALITION (the "Coalition" or "Petitioner")
25 challenges specific violations of law by respondents COUNTY OF ORANGE (the "County") and
26 ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ("Board") (County and Board are collectively

27 referred to herein as "Respondents"), as follows:

28

-1-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 1. Petitioner challenges the decision of respondent Board, as the elected legislative

2 body for respondent County, to approve the application submitted by real party in interest

3 Sheldon Development, LLC ("Sheldon" or "RPI"), to develop the so-called "Cowan Heights

4 Residential Development project" in the unincorporated community of North Tustin. The

5 project includes Planning Application PA 160051 for Zone Change 16-04, a Use Permit to allow

6 a for a 21-unit single-family detached planned development, and Vesting Tentative Tract Map

7 18062 to create 21 residential lots (the "Project") on a 6.03-acre site at 9922 Newport Avenue

8 (the "Site") in the unincorporated North Tustin community.
9 2. Petitioner contends that County's preparation of an environmental impact report
10 ("EIR") [State Clearinghouse No. 2016-1010411 for the Project, and the Board's certification

11 of that EIR, violate specific provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub.

& NNVIN 2 NOUNHIDOW IIOHIHT 12 Resources Code §§ 21000 et seq.: "CEQA") and the Guidelines for Implementation of CEQA
A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION 13 (Tit. 14, Cal. Code Regs., §§ 15000 et seq.: the "CEQA Guidelines"), a statutory and regulatory
14 framework commonly referred to as "the Holy Grail of California's environmental laws."

15 3. Petitioner is challenging the Project because (among other things), over the
16 objections of thousands of community residents, Respondents chose to ignore those objections

17 and "spot zone" the Site.

18 4. Petitioner contends that, by refusing to properly prepare, circulate and certify a
19 legally adequate EIR that (I) included an accurate and stable Project description, and (ii) fully
20 disclosed and analyzed all of the potential impacts that will result from the Project, Respondents

21 disregarded or treated as a mere formality the specific procedural and substantive requirements

22 of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines.

23 5. Petitioner also contends that Respondents' approval of the Project violates specific

24 requirements of California's Planning and Zoning Law (Gov. Code § § 65000 et seq.: "PZL").

25 6. Petitioner requests that this Court vacate and set aside the Project approval and the
26 EIR's certification by issuing a writ of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5,
27 directing Respondents to vacate and set aside their approval of the Project and certification of

28 the EIR for the Project.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2 7. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to sections 187 and 1094.5

3 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and section 21168 of the Public Resources Code.

8. Venue for this action properly lies in the Orange County Superior Court because
5 Respondents and the Parcels are located in Orange County.

6 PARTIES AND BENEFICIAL INTEREST

7 9. Petitioner is an unincorporated umbrella organization composed of and supported

8 by grassroots community groups and others devoted to the preservation of the environment. The
c grassroots community groups were organized for the purpose of (among other things)
10 representing the interests of the public in assuring compliance with the State's environmental

11 and land use laws. Petitioner's members reside within the unincorporated Orange County
8 NNVI Y NOUNIIOOW IIOHIIT 12 communities in and around North Tustin and/or own real property within that area. On behalf
A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION 13 of Petitioner's members, their respective constituents, and other Orange County residents,
14 Petitioner challenges the certification of EIR and approval of the Project by Respondents.

15 10. Petitioner has associational standing to bring this action and is a party beneficially
16 interested in the issuance of the requested writ of mandate and injunctive and declaratory relief

17 (I) because in accordance with Public Resources Code section 21177©, Petitioner is an

18 organization formed after the approval of the Project to maintain an action against Respondents

19 under CEQA, and (ii) because certain members of Petitioner--including individuals who are
20 members of one or more of the grassroots community groups comprising Petitioner-.--complied

21 with subdivisions (a) and (b) of Public Resources Code section 21177, and exhausted their

22 administrative remedies by timely commenting on and objecting to the contents and adequacy

23 of the EIR and the Project both orally and in writing.

24 11. Unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate, the impacts resulting from

25 Respondents' decision to certify the EIR and approve the Project will extend to areas in which
26 numerous citizens represented by Petitioner live and will directly and adversely affect their

27 health and living environment. Consequently, Petitioner is directly and beneficially interested

28 in the issuance of the requested writ of mandate.

-3-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

12. Respondent County is a public body, corporate and politic, organized and existing
under and by virtue of the laws of the State of California and is responsible for regulating and
controlling land use in all areas within unincorporated areas of the County, including (but not
4 limited to) implementing and complying with the provisions of CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines,

5 and the PZL.

13. Respondent Board is the duly constituted legislative body for Respondent County.

7 As such, Board is the governing body of County, and is responsible for carrying out County's
8 statutorily mandated duties, including (but not limited to) the formulation and implementation

9 of land use plans in the County and the preparation and certification of EIRs for those plans.

10 14. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that real party in
11 interest Sheldon is a California limited liability company. Sheldon is identified in the staff
dd NNVW 2 NOUNIIOOW CIOHHT 12 reports, agendas, and other materials presented to Respondents as the applicant for the Project's
PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION 13 approvals.

14 15. Since Respondents did not publicly identify any other persons or entities as
15 recipients of the approvals that are the subject of this action, Petitioner believes it has complied

16 with subdivision (a) of Public Resources Code section 21167.6.5.

17 16. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of the respondents named
18 herein as DOES 1 through 10, and the real parties in interest named herein as DOES 11 through
19 25, inclusive, and therefore sues those respondents and real parties in interest by such fictitious

20 names. Petitioner will amend this petition to allege the true names and capacities of those Doe

21 parties when ascertained. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that each

22 of the parties designated herein as a Doe is responsible in some manner for the events and

23 actions referred to herein.

24 17. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that at all relevant
25 times the County, the Board, Sheldon and the Doe respondents and/or real parties in interest

26 were and are the agents of each other, authorized to do the acts herein alleged, each of which

27 was ratified by the others.

28

-4-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

18. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, or otherwise of Does

2 through 25 are unknown to Petitioner who therefore sues Does 1 through 25 by such fictitious
names. Petitioner will amend this petition to allege the true names and capacities of the Doe
respondents when the same becomes known to it. Reference to "County", "Board" or
5 "Respondent" herein shall mean the named respondents and Does 1 through 10, and reference

6 to "Sheldon" or "RPIs" shall mean the named real party in interest Does 11 through 25.

7 19. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that Respondents, RPI

8 and each of the Does proximately caused the acts, omissions to act, and/or injuries herein
9 alleged.

10 ALLEGATIONS COMMON TO ALL CAUSES OF ACTION

20. On or about October 17, 2016, the County posted with the State Clearinghouse:
NNVI 12 "Notice of Preparation" publicizing its intent to prepare a draft EIR for the Project. The Notice 11

NOLLVMOdXOO IVNOISSHIONd V 13 of Preparation described the Project as follows:
d8 14 "Project would include the development of 22 new detached single-family homes NOCNHIDOW IIOHIHT 15 on an approx. 5.9 acre project site. The Applicant is proposing to demolish the

16 existing structure (storage shed) located on the project site and construct 22

17 detached single-family homes at a density of approx. 3 units per acre. The project

18 site conforms to the current General Plan designation of Suburban Residential;

19 however a zone change would be required form Agricultural Residential to

20 Planned Community or Planned Unit Development. The 22-single family units

21 would be two stores [sic] in height and have an average lot size of 10,000 sq. ft."

22 21. On May 2, 2016, the County released the draft EIR for the Project for a 45-day
23 public review period.

24 22. The Project was considered by the North Tustin Advisory Committee (*NTAC")

25 at its meeting of December 21, 2016. NTAC voted 5-0 to not approve the Project as proposed.
26| The NTAC's meeting minutes indicate that approximately 65 to 70 persons were in attendance

28 spoke on the Project. After each of the 17 speakers, NTAC asked for a show of hands in favor 27 and that, after Sheldon's presentation and NTAC members' questions, 17 members of the public

-5-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 of that speaker's comments. The attendees' show of hands are recorded in the NTAC minutes.

2 In making the motion to not approve the Project as submitted, NTAC members explained their
vote by summarizing that the Project did not conform to or blend with the established character
of the Cowan Heights community and cited the community opposition to the Project as
5 expressed at the meeting and in an on-line petition. The results of an on-line petition in
6 opposition to the Project were submitted and attached to the NTAC minutes.

7 23. County noticed a Planning Commission public hearing on the Project for October

8 11, 2017. However, due to the "Canyon Fire 2" events beginning on October 9, 2017, the Site
9 and surrounding area were affected by the fire and evacuation orders. On October 10, 2017,

10 Sheldon submitted a letter requesting that the Planning Commission continue the hearing and

11 the Planning Commission continued the hearing to November 8, 2017.

12 24. On November 8, 2017, the Planning Commission held a public hearing for the NNVI 13 Project. Thirty members of the public provided testimony on the Project proposal. After public
dd NOILVHOJXOD IVNOISSHONIF NOINHIOOW CIOEIHT 14 testimony and consideration, the Planning Commission voted unanimously to adopt Resolution
15 No. 17-05 recommending that the Board certify the EIR, adopt an uncodified ordinance
16 approving Zone Change 16-04, and adopt a resolution approving the Use Permit.

17 25. Thereafter, on December 12, 2017, the Board conducted a public hearing on the
18 Project at which time many persons again spoke in opposition to the Project. Counsel for the
19 Foothill Community Association submitted an objection letter to the Board urging the Board not
20| to approve the Project entitlements or certify the EIR.

22 community opposition to the Project and its incompatibility with that community, the Board 21 26. After receiving hours of testimony, and in complete disregard of widespread

23 certified the EIR but approved only one portion Project: Zone Change 16-04.

24 27. On December 13, 2017, the County filed and posted a Notice of Determination of
25 the Board's certification of the final EIR for the Project.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 26
(AGAINST RESPONDENT) PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 27

28 28. Petitioner realleges paragraphs 1 through 27.

-6-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

A. VIOLATION OF CEQA AND THE CEQA GUIDELINES

29. Respondents are, and at all times relevant herein have been, charged by law with
the performance of all duties of a "lead agency" arising under CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines,
4 including (but not limited to) the preparation, circulation and certification of a legally adequate
EIR for the Project.

6 30. CEQA applies to all "governmental agencies at all levels" and requires public

7 agencies to prepare an EIR whenever the approval of a project may cause significant adverse

8 effects or impacts on the environment. Respondents' decision to approve the Project was a
9 project approval causing significant adverse environmental impacts.

10 31. CEQA requires lead agencies to review the environmental impacts of all projects.

11 Under Public Resources Code Section 21065, a project is any discretionary public "activity
NNVW Y NOMNUIDOW CIIOHIIT 12 which may cause either : direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable
NOIIVHOIHOD IVNOISSHIONJ V 13 indirect physical change in the environment." Respondents' decision to approve the Project was
d 14 a discretionary decision by Respondents that will result in "reasonably foreseeable" adverse

15 environmental impacts.

16 32. A "significant effect on the environment" means a substantial, or potentially

17 substantial, adverse change in any of the physical conditions within the area affected by the
18| project including land, air, water, minerals, flora, fauna, ambient noise, and objects of historic

19 or aesthetic significance. By causing an EIR to be prepared for the Project, Respondents
20 conceded the Project's potential impact to the community required the preparation of an EIR.

21 33. In order for an EIR to be legally adequate, it must comport with certain

22 requirements set forth in CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines.

23 34. Respondents did not proceed in the manner required by law in that they produced

24 an EIR that was biased in favor of the proposed Project's approval and therefore failed to
25 constitute the full disclosure document intended to objectively inform decision-makers and the
26 public of the Project's true impacts, mitigation measures, and alternatives. Moreover,

27 Respondents' certification that the EIR satisfied the requirements of CEQA and the CEQA

28

-7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Guidelines constitutes an abuse of discretion in that Respondents failed to proceed in the manner

2 required by law and their decision is not supported by substantial evidence.

35. CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines require that the lead agency make certain written
4 findings and that the findings must be supported by substantial evidence in the record. 3

Respondents did not proceed in the manner required by law in that they failed to adopt findings

6 that are supported by substantial evidence, including (without limitation) with regard to failing
to support with any findings County's rejection of an entirely feasible and environmentally
8 superior alternative to the Project that the EIR acknowledged met all of the Project's objectives. 7

36. Respondents did not proceed in the manner required by law in that they failed to
10 acknowledge the Project's significant adverse impacts on aesthetics and split up Project approval
11 in an unlawful manner.

12 B. VIOLATION OF THE PZL NNVW NOILVMOINOO IVNOISSHJONI V 13 37. Respondents are, and at all times relevant herein have been, charged by law with
è 14 the performance of all duties arising under the PZL.

15 38. Despite the Site being surrounded by ntial development that was developed NOONIIOOW CIOHIAT 17 a develop at a density that was the same as neighboring development, Respondents approved a 16 at roughly half the density of the Project, and despite RPI publicly stating it was willing to

18 zone change that was anything but uniform with that surrounding density.

39.

20| "uniformity requirement," i.e., Government Code section 65852. As explained in Neighbors in 19 Thus, in approving the Project, Respondents violated the PZL's anti-spot zoning

21 Support of Appropriate Land Use v. County of Tuolumne (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 997,
22 Government Code section 65852 is

23 "like an enforcement clause, allowing parties to the [comprehensive zoning plan]

24 contract to challenge burdens unfairly imposed on them or benefits conferred on

25 others. According to a leading treatise, section 65852 'is intended to prevent

26 unreasonable discrimination against or benefit to particular properties within a

27 given zone.' (4 Manaster & Selmi, Cal. Environmental Law and Land Use, supra,

28 Zoning, § 60.70, p. 60-114.3 (rel. 45-9/06)].)"

-8-
VERIFIED PETITION FÖR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 (Id. at p. 1009; emphasis added.)

2 C. PROPRIETY OF RELIEF

40. The decision of Respondents to certify the EIR and approve the Project constitutes

4 a final decision as contemplated in Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and an "approval"

5 as defined in CEQA Guidelines section 15352..

41. Respondents have the legal duty in making their determinations to comply with
7 the applicable laws and regulations governing such acts. In particular, Respondents have the

8 legal and nondiscretionary duty to act in accordance with the requirements of CEQA, the CEQA
9 Guidelines, the PZL, and other applicable laws and regulations.

10 42. Respondents acted arbitrarily, capriciously, irrationally, and unreasonably, and

11 without any or an adequate evidentiary basis in failing or refusing to comply with the
12 requirements of CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, the PZL, and other applicable laws and
NOLLVAOHOD IVNOISSHIONI V & NNVW Y NOINHIDOW CIOHIT 13 regulations.

14 43. At all times material hereto, Respondents had, and continue to have, the ability to
15 comply with their legal duties and obligations. Respondents have failed and refused to perform

16 those duties and obligations notwithstanding the substantial evidence presented by Petitioner and
17 others that such failures and refusals are contrary to law and regulations and will have adverse
18 consequences on Petitioner, its members, and those residing in the surrounding community.

19 44. In acting and failing to act in the manner described above, Respondents have
20| prejudicially abused their discretion by certifying a legally inadequate EIR and approving the

21 Project, in violation of Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 et seq.

22 45. Petitioner has exhausted all available administrative remedies against

23 Respondent's decision to certify the EIR and approve the Project. There is no provision known

24 to Petitioner for any further administrative remedial action from the decision of Respondents to
25 certify the EIR and approve the Project.

26 46. Petitioner is beneficially interested in issuance of the writ of mandate as prayed

27 for hereafter and has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law other than the relief sought in
28 this petition. If the Court does not grant the relief prayed for herein, Petitioner will suffer

-9-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

irreparable injury for which it has no adequate remedy at law, there will be a waste, and the
2 failure to enjoin further conduct may tend to render the judgment in this action ineffectual.

3 47. Petitioner has commenced this action not more than 30 days after the notice

4 authorized by Public Resources Code section 21152 was filed, as required by Public Resources

5 Code Section 21167, and within the period of time otherwise prescribed for the commencement

6 of this action in Government Code section 65009.

48. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
8 21167.5 by sending, via the United States Postal Service, written notice of this action to 7

Respondent. A copy of the written notice provided to Respondents is attached hereto as
10 Exhibit 1 and is incorporated therein by reference.

11 49. Petitioner will cause a conformed copy of this Verified Petition for Writ of
NNVW 12 Mandate to be served on the Attorncy General in accordance with Public Resources Code
NOILVHOdNOO TVNOISSHdONd V 13 section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388.
PRAYER 8 14
NOCNHTOOW IIOHIHT 15 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for the following relief against Respondents and RPIs
16 and any and all other parties who may oppose Petitioner in this proceeding:
17 1. On the first cause of action, for a temporary restraining order and

18 preliminary and permanent injunctions setting aside and rescinding

19 Respondents' certification of the EIR and approval of the Project and

20 further prohibiting RPI from implementing the Project; or, alternatively, for

21 a judgment determining and declaring Respondents failed to fully comply

22 with CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, the PZL, and/or other applicable laws

23 and regulations, and granting a peremptory writ of mandate commanding

24 Respondents to set aside their certification of the EIR and approval of the

25 Project, and ordering Respondents to take no further steps toward

26 implementing the Project unless and until they fully comply with CEQA,

27 the CEQA Guidelines, the PZL, and/or other applicable laws and

28 regulations;

any other relief granted; 2. For reasonable attorneys' fees in addition to
