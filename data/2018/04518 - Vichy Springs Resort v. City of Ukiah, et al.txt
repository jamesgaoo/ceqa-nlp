23 L INTRODUCTION

•24 1. This Petition seeks, among other things, to set aside building pemmits issued on or

25 about December 21, 2017, by Respondents the City of Ukiah and the City Coumeil of the City

26 of Ukiah (collectively the "CITY*) to. the Ukiah Rifle and Pistol Club, Inc. (the *GUN CLUB-),

27 allowing the demolition of the main range and construction of a different and modern stracture, "one

28 of the biggest projects in recent Club history? (hereafterreferred to as "the PROJECT*). Petitioner

Lichy Sprines Resorl y. Cinr of lhhich, et al Petition for Writ of Manilale

EXHIBIT°1"

1 VICHY SPRINGS RESORT brings this action because the CITY and Respondent the County of

2 Mendocino and the Board of Supervisors of the County of Mendocino (collectively the "COUNTY")

3 did not, and refuse to, comply with their own land use laws and State environmental laws, including

4 the California Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code §21000 et seq.) (CEQA), in

5 allowing the issuance of the building permits for the GUN CLUB, as has been the case with many

6 other similar previous land use approvals. The CITY, moreover, has been misapplying, and thus

7 failing to enforce, the terms of its long-term lease with the GUN CLUB.

8 2. More generally, the CITY and the COUNTY have a pattern and practice of failing

9 to regulate the GUN CLUB, which hurts the environment and the public, including Petitioner. In

10 particular, the extensive use of lead bullets on the subject property has caused a buildup of lead
11 throughout the site, with the result, among others, that water flowing off the property contains
12 hazardous lead levels far in excess of what federal and state regulatory authorities consider

13 acceptable for wildlife, human health, or drinking water purposes. These problems will only grow

14 worse over time without intervention by this court.

15 3. Consequently, Petitioner seeks the following relief: (i) a peremptory writ of mandate

16 directing the CITY to set aside its approval of the above-described building permits; (ii) a

17 declaration that the CITY and COUNTY have engaged, and continue to engage, in an unlawful

18 pattern and practice of ignoring their obligations to enforce pertinent land use and environmental

19 laws with respect to the ongoing operation of the GUN CLUB, including, in particular, the Planning

20 and Zoning Law (Government Code §65000 et seq.) and CEQA; (iii) an injunction requiring the

21 CITY and the COUNTY to regulate the GUN CLUB pursuant to, and consistent with, the CITY'S

22 Lease with the GUN CLUB and the two local agencies' respective regulatory powers over land use

23 and environmental quality occurring at the GUN CLUB, and an injunction directing the GUN CLUB

24 to cêase all unauthorized or improperly authorized activities within the GUN CLUB site until such

25 time, if ever, as both the CITY and the COUNTY have granted all of the necessary governmental

26 authorizations and Lease approvals needed for such activities to proceed in a lawful manner.

III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND 16
.. .* 17 13. The property occupied by the GUN CLUB is owned by the CITY OF UKIAH in an

.....-. 18  unincorporated area of the County of Mendocino.

19 14. The GUN CLUB originally leased the property from Leo Franceschi Johnson, Linda

20 Franceschi, and Harry Franceschi ("FRANCESCHIS"). The property leased by the GUN CLUB is

21 not zoned for shooting ranges under the Mendocino County Zoning Code. (See Mendocino Zoning

22 Code $20.060.010.) The County designated the GUN CLUB as a nonconforming use in 1982.

23 15. On or about December 20, 1993, the CITY acquired the property at 2300 Vichy

24 Springs Road (approximately 96.82 acres of real property) from the FRANCESCHIS. The CITY

25 asserted that the public purpose for the purchase of the real property was to use it as a buffer zone

26 against additional residential development occurring on the south side of Vichy Springs Road, which

27 could impact then existing landfill operations.

28

- 4. II Vichy Springs Resort v. Citv of Ukiah, et al.
Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 16. The purchase was approved at the December 15, 1993 City Council Meeting. Prior

2 to voting on the purchase, the City Manager informed the Council members that the property was

3 used for the GUN CLUB's operations, and that the CITY would assume the existing 50-year lease

4 between the FRANCESCHIS and GUN CLUB, which was set to expire in 2044.

5 17. Contrary to the City Manager's representations to the City Council, the new Lease

6 had not yet been executed by the FRANCESCHIS and the GUN CLUB prior to the Council hearing

7 on December 15, 1993. Indeed, the FRANCESCHIS and the GUN CLUB did not execute the Lease

8 until the next day, December 16, 1993. The new Lease was thereafter accepted by the CITY.

© 18. The CITY did not prepare an Environmental Impact Report or Negative Declaration

10 for its actions purchasing the property or assuming the lease; nor did the CITY otherwise issue a

11 Notice of Exemption asserting that such actions were exempt from CEQA.

12 19. The Lease does not require the GUN CLUB to provide any public benefit. The GUN

13 CLUB is not open to the public, except for events controlled by the GUN CLUB. The GUN CLUB
14 exclusively controls club membership and otherwise limits public access to the property at 2300

15 Vichy Springs Road. There is coded, locked gate for exclusive use by members. New membership

16 requires sponsorship by existing members. The GUN CLUB also requires that its members maintain

17 a membership with the National Rifle Association (NRA).

18 20. 5 Section 5 of the Lease provides, in pertinent part, that "at all times during the term

19 of this Lease, Lessee shall maintain the leased premises in an orderly condition and in conformity

20 with all applicable laws, ordinances, and regulations of any governmental body pertaining to the use

21 thereof."

22 21. Section 11 of the Lease provides, in pertinent part, that "Lessee shall not intentionally

23 or negligently commit or permit others to commit waste or nuisance, public or private, upon any

24 portion of the leased premises. Lessee shall not discharge, release, improperly store or dispose of

25 on the leased premises any hazardous or toxic substance as defined in local, state or federal law...."

26 22. Section 13(a) of the Lease provides, in pertinent part, that "Lessee shall not, without
27 Lessor's prior consent, make any alterations, improvements, additions, changes, or modification to,

28
Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Ukiah. et al.
Petition for Writ of Mandate - 5 -

r on, in, or upon the leased premises, except for nonstructural alterations not exceeding $5,000.00 in

2 costs. Lessor shall not unreasonably withhold its consent."

3 23. Section 14(a) of the Lease provides that Lessee accepts the leased premises in its as

4 is condition and "subject to all applicable local, county, state and federal laws, statutes, ordinances,

5 rules and regulations governing, directing or otherwise affecting Lessee's use of the leased premises,

6 including, but not limited to, any and all zoning, land use, health and environmental enactments.

7 Lessee shall at its sole cost and expense, promptly comply with any such laws, statutes, ordinances,
rules, regulations, orders and requirements in effect during the term or any part of the term of this

9 Lease Agreement, should the same be necessary in connection with Lessee's continuing use of the

10 leased premises."

11 24. Since the CITY purchased the property, the GUN CLUB's membership has grown

12 from 40 to over 1,000 members. The GUN CLUB has dramatically increased the number of special

13 events it hosts. It has also allowed, for many years, overnight camping on multiple occasions.

14 25. The GUN CLUB has constructed new and/or modified the structures located on the

15 CITY -owned property. A new club house and kitchen were built, and the GUN CLUB has spent

16 over $350,000.00 on three new ranges (pistol, rifle, and traps). The use of these ranges has led to a
17 proliferation of lead bullets throughout the subject site, resulting in, among other things, the
18 contamination of water flowing from the property.

19 26. The GUN CLUB did not obtain the CITY's approval for these projects or apply for

20 a use permit or obtain building permits from Respondent COUNTY. Presently, the CITY contends

21 that the CITY-owned property leased to the GUN CLUB is not subject to planning, zoning laws or

22 the proper exercise of police power by either the CITY or COUNTY. The CITY does not regulate

23 the GUN CLUB in accordance with the Lease, CEQA, the Ukiah City Code, or the Ukiah General

24 Plan. Nor does the CITY require the GUN CLUB to comply with Mendocino County laws. The
25  COUNTY similarly does not regulate the GUN CLUB in accordance with CEQA, the Mendocino

26 County General Plan, or County Zoning a and Building Codes. As a result of the indifference of both

27 the CITY and the COUNTY to the activities occurring within the GUN CLUB site, the property has

28
Vichy Springs Resort v. Citv of Ukiah, et al.
-6 - Petition for Writ of Mandate

L

2 become an island of unregulated private acti vity in which unsupervised individuals are engaged in

3 actions, some of which are dangerous and/or harmful to the environment, that could not lawfully

4 occur without governmental authorization on typical private property located in the COUNTY's
unincorporated area.

5 27.

6 Under Section 13(a) of the Lease, as noted above, the GUN CLUB is required to

7 obtain the CITY's consent prior 1o making alternations and improvements. The CITY interprets

8 Section 13(a), however, as though the CITY's approval is limited solely to assuring that the

9 structures or other improvements comply with the applicable building codes as adopted by the CITY.

28.

10 Furthermore, despite the above-quoted language in Sections 5 and 14(a) of the Lease,

11 the CITY does not require the GUN CLUB to comply with CEQA, the General Plan of the CITY,

12 the Mendocino County General Plan or the Zoning and Building Codes of the COUNTY.

29. The CITY's narrow interpretation of its powers under the Lease overlooks the plain
13  language of sections 5, 13(a), and 14(a). As noted above, Section 13(a) allows the City to withhold

14

15 its approval of proposed "alterations, improvements, additions, changes, or modification to, on, in,
or upon the leased premises," as long as doing So is not "unreasonable." As also noted above,
16 Section 5 requires the GUN CLUB operators to "maintain the leased premises conformity with

17

18 all applicable laws, ordinances, and regulations," while Section 14(a) makes the operator's use of

19 the property expressly "subject to all applicable local, county, state and federal laws, statutes,
ordinances, rules and regulations governing, directing or otherwise affecting Lessee's use of the
20 | leased premises, including, but not limited to, any and all zoning, land use, health and environmental

21 enactments." Similar language can also be found in section 11 of the Lease.

22 30.

23 Petitioner asserts that, under the unique circumstances associated with the Lease, the

24 CITY must interpret and apply Section 13(a), together with Sections 5, 11, and 14(a), in a manner

25 that forcefully protects the public interest via the full regulatory authority of the CITY, including its

26 police power and its obligations as an owner of public property. Thus, it would be entirely

27 "reasonable" for the CITY to disallow proposed "alterations, improvements, additions, changes, or

28 modification to, on, in, or upon the leased premises" that CITY officials conclude would be contrary

I Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Ukiah, et al.
Petition for Writ of Mandate - 7-

a.-... - ..

1 to the general welfare, contrary to public health and safety, contrary to the property's general plan

2 or zoning designations, or unacceptable from an environmental standpoint.

3 31. The CITY's notion that its authority over the GUN CLUB under the Lease is limited

4 just to the issuance of building permits is also undermined by the plain language of the CITY's own

5 Ukiah City Code, which does not authorize the CITY to extend its regulatory jurisdiction into the

6 COUNTY's unincorporated area. Through Section 3000 of the Ukiah City Code, the City Council

7 has adopted and made "effective within the City" the model codes and specific appendices listed and

8 defined in Sections 3001-3011 of the Ukiah City Code (Building Regulations Chapter). In turn,

Q Section 3012 of the Ukiah City Code defines "jurisdiction," as used in any of the model codes

10 adopted, to mean the "City of Ukiah." The GUN CLUB property is not within the City.

11 32. While the CITY, notwithstanding both the broad language in sections 5, 11, 13(a),

12 and 14(a) of the Lease as well as the CITY's absence of regulatory authority over land outside its
13 municipal boundaries, disavows any regulatory authority over the GUN CLUB other than the
14 issuance of building permits, the COUNTY takes an even narrower view of its authority over the

15 GUN CLUB. Because the subject property is owned by the CITY, the COUNTY claims that its own

16 regulatory authority does not extend to the property. The basis for this contention is found in

17 Government Code sections 53090 and 53091. The latter statute requires that "[e]ach local agency

18 shall comply with all applicable building ordinances and zoning ordinances of the county or city in

19 which the territory of the local agency is situated." (Government Code §53091(a), italics added.) The

20 former statute provides, however, that the term "local agency" does not include a city. (Id.,

21 §53090(a).) Thus, in general, property owned a by a city in a county unincorporated area is not subject

22 to the county's building and zoning ordinances. Here, the COUNTY reasons that, because the CITY

23 owns the GUN CLUB, the property cannot be subject to the COUNTY's building or zoning

24 ordinances, despite the fact that the GUN CLUB leases the property from the CITY and uses it for

25 its own private purposes. The COUNTY maintains this position despite being fully aware of the

26 CITY's own hands-off approach to what occurs within the GUN CLUB site.

27

28
Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Ukiah, et al.
Petition for Writ of Mandate .8.

1 33. As is evident to any observer, the unwillingness of either the CITY or the COUNTY

2 to regulate activities occurring within the GUN CLUB site has created an island of virtual regulatory

3 anarchy within the COUNTY's unincorporated area. Both the CITY and the COUNTY cannot be

4 correct in refusing to oversee and regulate what occurs on the GUN CLUB site, particularly given

5 the operator's reckless use of lead, which has contaminated not only the GUN CLUB site but also

6 adjacent waterways and private and public properties. Indeed, both of these local agencies are

7 incorrect in their views of their obligations regarding the subject property. Both the CITY and the

8 COUNTY are obligated to protect the public interest and general welfare by regulating and

9 supervising the often dangerous and environmentally harmful activities occurring with the GUN

10 CLUB. First, the CITY must assert its authority and obligations through its role as Lessor under

11 sections 5, 11, 13(a), and 14(a) of the Lease. And second, the COUNTY must treat the property as

12 de facto private property in its unincorporated area, and thus subject to the full panoply of the

13 COUNTY's regulatory powers, including its police power and its statutory authority under, inter alia,

14 the Planning and Zoning Law and CEQA. Alternatively, at least one of the two local agencies should

15 assert some level of control over the GUN CLUB: either the CITY through its role as Lessor, or the

16 COUNTY in a regulatory capacity.

17 IV. THE PROJECT

18 34. In order to accommodate the increase in use, the GUN CLUB is undertaking to

19 demolish the main range and rebuild with a different and modern structure. Copies of the GUN

20 CLUB's announcement as to its proposed PROJECT, the Building Permit Application to the CITY

21 and Plans, detailing the scope of work, are attached hereto as Exhibit "A". ("the PROJECT")

22 35. The GUN CLUB's soil is contaminated with lead and clay pigeons; and runoff from

23 the ranges, rich in lead, has already contaminated water flowing off the site and will continue to do

24 SO on a greater scale under the PROJECT. The demolition of this lead-contaminated building and
25 the grading and storage of lead contaminated soil will have a direct impact on the environment: The

26 PROJECT will also increase noise, traffic, and safety concerns which will directly impact the
27 | environment.

28
Vichv Springs Resort v. Citv of Ukiah, et al.
Petition for Writ of Mandate - 9 -

1 36. Under Section 13(a) of the Lease, the GUN CLUB must get the CITY's discretionary

2 approval for the demolition and construction of the main range. As discussed earlier, that provision

3 gives the CITY discretion to withhold or impose conditions on such proposed changes, as long as

4 the CITY's action is reasonable. The need for the CITY's discretionary approval will trigger CEQA.

5 37. The CITY has issued building permits and the PROJECT commenced on/or about

6 January 2, 2018 without any CEQA review. Additionally, the CITY does not have the power under

7 the Ukiah City Code to issue building permits for GUN CLUB property outside the CITY. Of equal

8 importance, the PROJECT is contrary to the Mendocino County Code, as Section 20.204.015(B)

9 thereof provides that, once a nonconforming structure is voluntarily demolished, the nonconforming

10 use cannot be resumed.

11 38. As stated above, the COUNTY designated the GUN CLUB as a nonconforming use

12 in 1982. Mendocino Zoning Code Section 20.204.015(B) provides that "whenever a structure, the

13 use of which does not conform with the regulations for the zone in which it is located, or a structure

14 which does not comply with the standards of yard spaces, height of structures, distance between

15 structures, parking, etc., prescribed in the regulations for the zone in which it is located shall be

16 voluntarily razed, the structure shall not be restored except in full conformity with the regulations

17 of the zone in which it is located, and the nonconforming use shall not be resumed."

18 39. Petitioner and the public will be harmed as a result of the CITY's and COUNTY's a

19 ongoing policies and practices of bypassing the requirements of CEQA and ignoring the procedural

20 and substantive requirements of the COUNTY's own zoning ordinances. Petitioner has notified the

21 CITY and COUNTY of these acts orally and in a letter dated October 31, 2017. On November 16,

22 2017, Petitioner notified the CITY that under Section 13(a) of the Lease, the CITY's actions in

23 response to the GUN CLUB's request is subject to CEQA.

24 40. Petitioner has exhausted all administrative remedies in that the PROJECT is

25 proceeding and there are no appeal or administrative procedures provided by state or local laws.
26 Such efforts were not required as a precondition to filing this litigation, however, as neither the CITY

27 nor the COUNTY provided any opportunity for public review and comment on its position or any

28
Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Ukiah, et al. Petition for Writ of Mandate - 10 -

G

opportunity to participate in any hearing or submit evidence. (See Public Resources Code §21167(e)

2 [exhaustion of administrative remedies is not required under CEQA "there was no public hearing
or other opportunity for members of the public to raise ... objections orally or in writing prior to the
approval of the project, or if the public agency failed to give the notice required by law"];
Government Code §65009(b) [similar language limiting the application of the exhaustion doctrine

6 under the Planning and Zoning Law].)

41. Petitioner does not have a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course
of law because Petitioner and the public will be irreparably harmed by the ensuing environmental
9 damage and by the Respondents' violations of CEQA, the Ukiah City Code and General Plan, and

10 Mendocino County planning, zoning and building laws.

11 V. VENUE AND JURISDICTION

12 42. This court has jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure

13 sections 526 (injunctive relief), 1060 (declaratory relief), and 1085 (traditional mandamus); and

14 Public Resources Code sections 21167(d) (statute oflimitations) and 21168.5 (traditional mandamus

15 review under CEQA).

16 43. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 393
17  (actions against public officers) and 395 (actions generally) because the offices of both the CITY and

18 the COUNTY, as well as Petitioner's place of doing business (and locus of harms), are all located

19 in Mendocino County.

20 44. On January 3, 2018, before the commencement of this action, Petitioner served

21 written notice of the commencement of this action on Respondents in accordance with the
22 | requirements of Public Resource Code section 21167.5. A true and correct copy of this notice and

23 its proof of service are attached hereto as Exhibit "B" and incorporated herein by this reference.

24 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

25 (Failure to Comply with CEQA)

26 45. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates herein by reference as though fully set forth
27| herein paragraphs 1-44.

28
Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Ukiah, et al.
Petition for Writ of Mandate - 11 -

46. CEQA applies to all nonexempt discretionary projects. (Public Resource Code

2 §21080(a).) A "project" is an activity undertaken, approved, funded, or permitted by a public agency

3 that may cause a direct, or reasonably foreseeable indirect, physical change in the environment.

4 (Public Resource Code §21065.) The GUN CLUB's proposed activity is a project under CEQA. The

5 CITY and COUNTY have the ability and authority to mitigate environmental damage or to deny the

6 PROJECT.

7 47. The CITY asserts that private projects that only require a ministerial permit by a

8 public agency are not projects subject to CEQA and building permits are generally considered

9 ministerial permits to which CEQA does not apply.

10 48. In taking this position, the CITY ignores both its function as Lessor of the subject

11 property and the plain language of Section 13(a) of the Lease, which gives the CITY discretion over

12 potential actions proposed by the GUN CLUB, and makes the CITY's action in response to the

13 request from the GUN CLUB subject to CEQA.

14 49. Section 13(a) of the Lease provides that "Lessor shall not unreasonably withhold its

15 consent," which language gives the CITY discretion within the meaning of CEQA either to deny or

16 to condition the GUN CLUB's request to make improvements on the CITY owned property. Section

17 13(a), moreover, must be understood in light of Sections 5, 11, and 14(a) of the Lease. Section 5

18 requires the GUN CLUB operators to "maintain the leased premises conformity with all
19 applicable laws, ordinances, and regulations," while Section 14(a) makes the operator's use of the

20 property expressly "subject to all applicable local, county, state and federal laws, statutes,

21 ordinances, rules and regulations governing, directing or otherwise affecting Lessee's use of the

22 leased premises, including, but not limited to, any and all zoning, land use, health and environmental

23 enactments." Section 11 contains similar language. Although this language prevents the CITY from
24 unreasonably withholding its consent, the CITY may reasonably determine that the environmental

25 effects of the GUN CLUB's proposals are unacceptable or should be made subject to mitigation

26 requirements. Any other interpretation of the Lease would be unlawful, as it would transform the

27

28
Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Ukiah, et al.
Petition for Writ of Mandate - 12 -

Lease into a wholesale delegation of the CITY's police power to a private party, which cannot
2 lawfully occur.

3 50. Under CEQA, a discretionary approval exists where the CITY has the authority to

4 exercise subjective judgment in denying or conditioning the PROJECT to avoid or reduce its
environmental impact. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, div. 6, ch. 3 ["CEQA Guidelines"] §15357.)

6 Conversely, a ministerial approval exists where the GUN CLUB can legally compel the PROJECT

7 approval without any change in design that might alleviate adverse environmental consequences, and

8 the CITY exercises little or no judgment and merely determines whether the PROJECT conforms

9 to fixed, objective standards. (CEQA Guidelines §15369.)

10 51. Since under Section 13(a) of the Lease, the GUN CLUB cannot compel approval

11 without any changes in the design of its PROJECT which might alleviate adverse environmental

12 consequences, the CITY's actions in response to the GUN CLUB's request are thus subject to

13 CEQA. The fact that the GUN CLUB seeks a building permit, which in normal circumstances could

14 be ministerial, does not limit the CITY's discretion as Lessor under Section 13(a).

15 52. The actions of the CITY in allowing the PROJECT, without any CEQA compliance,

16 is a prejudicial abuse of discretion because the CITY failed to proceed in a manner required by law

17 as follows: The CITY has improperly determined that the GUN CLUB's PROJECT is not subject

18 to CEQA, has failed to determine whether the PROJECT will have a significant effect on the a
19 environment, and has wrongfully issued building permits for a structure on property located outside

20 of its jurisdiction.

21 53. The PROJECT may cause a significant impact on the environment, including, but not

22 limited to, the use and storage of hazardous materials and water, air, noise, safety, fire, and traffic

23 impacts, plus the impact on a state landmark (the Vichy Springs Resort) and neighboring properties.

24 Consequently, the CITY has prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed in a manner

25 required by law by failing to undertake any CEQA review and wrongfully determining that the

26 PROJECT is not subject to CEQA.

Petition for Writ of Mandate - 13 -

1 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Violation of Mendocino County Zoning Ordinance)

3 54. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates herein by reference as though fully set forth

4 herein paragraphs 1-53.

5 55. The building permits are invalid and constitutes prejudicial abuse of discretion as

6 the CITY does not have the powcr to issue building permits to the GUN CLUB since the property

7 is outside the city limits. Any authority exercised by the CITY over onsite activities must be via

8 Section 13(a) of the Lease, as understood against the backdrop of Sections 5, 11, and 14(a). Any such

Q approval by the CITY must be in addition to a land use approval granted by the COUNTY. The
10 COUNTY'S acquiescence in allowing the PROJECT is a prejudicial abuse of discretion under

11 Mendocino Zoning Code Section 20.204.015(B), which provides that, once the main range is

12 demolished, the nonconforming use shall not be resumed. The building permits are invalid and must

13 be set aside.

14 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (Violation of Planning Laws)

16 56. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates herein by reference as though fully set forth

17 herein paragraphs 1-55.

18 57. The building permits are invalid and constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion in that

19 the CITY failed to proceed in the manner required by law as the CITY did not consider its General
20 Plan policies or the General Plan policies of Mendocino County. Under the Lease, the PROJECT

21 must be in compliance with the General Plan policies of the CITY and the COUNTY.

22 58. For example, there is no evidence that the CITY applied the following General Plan

23 policies of the CITY:

24 Policy CT-1.2: City and County Staff shall include traffic and circulation information in
25 staff reports to their respective Planning Commissions. 26
Policy CT-1.3: All proposed development shall be
27 reviewed for its immediate and cumulative transportation impacts.
28
Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Ukiah, et al.
Petition for Writ of Mandate - 14 -

1 Policy CT-16.4: Balance the need for new development with methods of accommodating 2 increasing traffic.

3
59. There is also no evidence that the CITY applied the following General Plan policies
4
of Mendocino County:
5
Policy DE-98: The County will protect residential areas and other noise-sensitive 6 uses from excessive noise by doing the following:

7 1) Requiring that new land uses, new roadways, and other new noise sources do not create unacceptable noise levels on 8 adjacent parcels.
0 ***

10 3) Requiring the County decisions which would cause or allow an increase in noise created by stationary or mobile sources 11 (such as development of noise-generating land uses or the construction of new or wider roadways) be informed by a 12 noise analysis and accompanied by noise reduction measures
to keep noise at acceptable levels. 13

14 Policy DE-121: New discretionary development will be required to demonstrate that basic infrastructure is available and has adequate capacity to serve the project without degrading, existing level of service standards. 15
Policy DE-203: All development projects shall include plans and facilities to store 16 and manage solid waste and hazardous materials and wastes in a safe and environmentally sound manner. 17
Land uses, densities and intensities shall be designed to reduce human 18 Policy DE-208: risk and exposure to hazardous conditions and events.
19 Policy DE-214: The County shall deny development proposals that present substantial| fire hazard risk to residents and safety providers responding to a 20 wildland fire.
21 Policy DE-215: Development shall be located, designed and managed to reduce fire risk to life, property and natural resources, and incorporates adequate 22 fire protection consistent with the General Plan and adopted regulations. 23

24 60. The CITY's approval must be consistent with the applicable General Plan policies
25 of the CITY and Mendocino County. The CITY's actions were arbitrary and capricious and there
26 is no substantial evidence to support the issuance of the building permits. The building permits are
27 invalid and must be set aside.

28
Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Ukiah, et al.
- 15 - Petition for Writ of Mandate

FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Declaratory Relief - Failure to Regulate)

3 61. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates herein by reference as though fully set forth

4 herein paragraphs 1-60.

5 62. Respondent CITY and COUNTY refuse to regulate the activities of the GUN CLUB
on the CITY owned property, and have a pattern or practice a of not complying with CEQA, the

7 Planning and Zoning Law, their respective General Plans, and other pertinent governing regulatory

8 authorities. The GUN CLUB's requests for approval under Paragraph 13(a) of the Lease is subject

9 to environmental review under CEQA. Furthermore, the GUN CLUB should seek from the
10 COUNTY whatever regulatory approvals would be needed to ensure that GUN CLUB projects are

11 consistent with the COUNTY's General Plan, zoning, and other applicable County regulatory
12 requirements. Such requests for approvals will trigger the COUNTY's own obligations under CEQA

13 where the approvals sought would require the COUNTY to exercise discretion and have some

14 potential for adverse environmental effects.

15 63. When presented with a request from the GUN CLUB to make any alterations,
16 | improvements, additions, changes, or modification to, on, in, or upon the leased premises, the CITY

17 must consider whether the proposed activity a is a "project" under CEQA and, if so, must conduct a

18 preliminary review in order to determine whether the activity may be exempt from CEQA or requires

19 the preparation of either a negative declaration or an EIR. The CITY has an established policy of not

20 complying with CEQA. The CITY's practice, under Paragraph 13(a) of the Lease, is that the CITY

21 will consent to the proposed activity by the GUN CLUB on condition that the GUN CLUB applies

22 for and receives building permits. This practice is unlawful because the CITY does no
23 environmental review prior to approving permit requests, and because the CITY does not have the

24 authority to issue building permits outside the city limits. As explained above, Section 13(a) of the

25 Lease gives the CITY sufficient discretion to require CEQA compliance prior to approval of requests

26 made by the GUN CLUB.

27 64. Respondent COUNTY contends that it has no authority to regulate the GUN CLUB

28
Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Ukiah. et al.
Petition for Writ of Mandate - 16 -

1 property, even though it is located in an unincorporated portion of the County and is used for private

2 GUN CLUB purposes. The CITY contends that it has no power to regulate, except for the issuance
of building permits, because the GUN CLUB property is outside of city limits.

4 65. Respondent COUNTY contends that pursuant to Government Code sections 53090

5 and 53091, cities and counties are mutually exempt from each other's building and zoning

6 ordinances and, therefore, the CITY is exempt from the COUNTY's building and zoning regulations

7 on the property it owns, and the COUNTY has no jurisdiction to enforce its general plan, zoning,

8 and building regulations on the property. Over the years, the COUNTY's refusal to assert any sort

9 of regulatory authority over the property amounts to an established policy of simply ignoring what

10 occurs on the property, to the detriment of the public interest and environment. If the COUNTY had

11 been properly regulating the GUN CLUB in recent years, the dangerous proliferation of lead

12 throughout the property and onto adjacent properties might not have occurred.

13 66. Petitioner alleges that the COUNTY is obligated to regulate lands within its
14 jurisdiction, including unincorporated areas of the County. Petitioner further alleges that the CITY,

15 under the Lease, and in accordance with Sections, 5, 11, 13(a) and 14(a) of the Lease, has an
16 obligation to ensure that its Lessee complies with applicable land use laws. Petitioner alleges that

17 the Mendocino County Building and Zoning Codes, the General Plans of the CITY and COUNTY,

18 and CEQA apply to the GUN CLUB.

19 67. Petitioner alleges that there is no immunity under Government Code sections 53090

20 and 53091 since the GUN CLUB is a private club engaged in its own private pursuits, in accordance

21 with a Lease that provides no public benefit or use. Further, Petitioner alleges that Sections 5, 11,

22 13(a) and 14(a) of the Lease require that the GUN CLUB be regulated and that immunity not apply.

23 The CITY assumed a lease between two private parties which provided for regulation of the GUN

24 CLUB and so immunity was waived. At present, the property is de facto private property subject to

25 the COUNTY's various regulatory powers on the same footing as other private property in the
26 unincorporated area. Yet the COUNTY treats the property as though the CITY used it for city

27 purposes (e.g., a corporation yard).

28
Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Ukiah. et al.
Petition for Writ of Mandate - 17 -

68. Respondents CITY and COUNTY wrongfully fail to require the GUN CLUB to

2 obtain Use Permits or to comply with General Plan policies, zoning requirements, building laws of

3 the County, or CEQA. The granting of a Use Permit by the COUNTY would require environmental

4 review under CEQA. Petitioner contends that the GUN CLUB has engaged in multiple violations

5 of applicable land use laws with the CITY's and the COUNTY's knowledge. This anarchic approach

6 to land use planning, which has resulted in the GUN CLUB's profligate use of lead bullets resulting

7 in widespread lead contamination, will continue throughout the remaining life of the Lease absent

8 intervention from this court.

9 69. The GUN CLUB has violated the COUNTY's Zoning Code with respect to changes

10 to non-conforming uses, and the CITY and COUNTY have not compelled compliance. Mendocino

11 Zoning Code section 20.204.020 restricts changes to non-conforming uses absent a permit: "[a] non-

12 conforming use may increase its lume of operation provided the structure is not altered or enlarged

13 to accommodate its increase without obtaining a use permit." Since the CITY assumed the Lease

14 in 1993, the GUN CLUB has changed its non-conforming use and modified structures on the

15 property to accommodate the changed use. Petitioner has notified the CITY and COUNTY of these
16  changes, but to no avail.

17 70. The GUN CLUB has violated the COUNTY's Zoning Code with respect to camping,

18 and the CITY and COUNTY have not compelled compliance. The COUNTY's Zoning Code section
19 20.060.025 requires facilities that permit camping to obtain a Major Use Permit. The State of

20 California requires a license to operate a campground. Yet the Gun Club allows unauthorized

21 overnight camping on the property.

22 71. The GUN CLUB has violated the COUNTY's Building Code, and the CITY and

23 COUNTY have not compelled compliance. The COUNTY's Building Code requires that "no

24 person, firm, or corporation shall erect, construct, enlarge, alter, repair, move, improve, occupy,
25 remove, convert, or demolish any building or structure in the unincorporated area of the County or

26 cause the same to be done without first obtaining a separate building permit for each such building

27 or structure..." (Mendocino County Code §18.08.010.) The GUN CLUB has not obtained a building

28
Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Ukiah. et al.
Petition for Writ of Mandate - 18 -

permit from the COUNTY for construction that has occurred since 1993.

2 72. The failure to regulate has created a continuing nuisance on the property since there

3 are excessive noise, traffic, pollution, fire hazards and safety concerns from the GUN CLUB's

4 activities on the CITY's property. The GUN CLUB's use of the land is impairing the use and

5 enjoyment of VICHY SPRINGS RESORT and neighboring properties.

6 73. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists relating to the rights and duties of

7 the parties herein. On the one hand, Petitioner contends, as described above, that the CITY and the

8 COUNTY have failed to regulate the GUN CLUB, and that the actions of the CITY and COUNTY
9 have created a continuing nuisance on the property. On the other hand, the CITY and the COUNTY

10 claim that they have no obligation to regulate the GUN CLUB or to enjoin the GUN CLUB's

11 activities. The COUNTY claims that, under Government Code sections 53090 and 53091, GUN

12 CLUB is exempt from the COUNTY's Building and Zoning Codes.

13 74. Petitioner desires a judicial determination of its rights, and a declaration as to the
14 construction and application of Government Code §§53090 and 53091 and a determination that the

15 GUN CLUB is subject to land use regulations by Respondents either because there is no immunity

16 or the Lease requires regulation. A judicial declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time
17 under the circumstances in order that Petitioner may ascertain its rights under the law and a

18 determination that there is no immunity under Government Code §53090 and 53091 and/or under

19 the Lease.

20 75. Petitioner also seeks an injunction requiring the CITY and the COUNTY to compel
21 the GUN CLUB to comply with the applicable land use laws cited above. Unless Petitioner is
22 granted injunctive relief, Petitioner and the public will suffer irreparable harm in that the CITY's and
23 COUNTY's failure to regulate will further the adverse environmental impact described in this

24 Petition.

25 76. Petitioner also seeks preliminary and permanent prohibitory injunctions directing the

26 GUN CLUB to cease all unauthorized or improperly authorized activities within the GUN CLUB

27 site until such time, if ever, as either the CITY or the COUNTY, or both, have granted all of the

28
Vichy Springs Resort v. Citv of Ukiah. et al.
Petition for Writ of Mandate - 19 -

1 necessary governmental authorizations and Lease approvals needed for such activities to proceed in
a lawful manner.

3 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for Judgment as follows:

4 1. That the Court issue a peremptory Writ of Mandate commanding the CITY to rescind,

5 void and set side the building permits and any action authorizing the development of the PROJECT;

6 further commanding the COUNTY to undertake a zoning enforcement action preventing

7 development of the PROJECT; and directing the CITY and the GUN CLUB to stop all activities

8 under the building permits until the CITY and COUNTY have complied with CEQA and all other

q applicable state and local land use laws;

10 2. For a declaration that the CITY owned property leased to the GUN CLUB is subject
11 to land use regulations by the CITY and the COUNTY and a determination that there is no immunity

12 under Government Code §53090 and 53091;

13 3. For a temporary restraining order and preliminary and permanent mandatory

14 injunctions requiring the CITY and the COUNTY to regulate the GUN CLUB pursuant to, and

15 consistent with, the CITY's Lease with the GUN CLUB and the two local agencies' respective

16 regulatory powers over land use and environmental quality occurring at the GUN CLUB, including,

17 in particular, the Planning and Zoning Law and CEQA;

18 4. For a temporary restraining order and preliminary and permanent prohibitory

19 injunctions directing the GUN CLUB to cease all unauthorized or improperly authorized activities

20 within the GUN CLUB site until such time, if ever, as both the CITY and the COUNTY have

21 granted all of the necessary governmental authorizations and Lease approvals needed for such

22 activities to proceed in a lawful manner;

23 5. For reasonable attorney's fees as provided by law, including Code of Civil Procedure

24 section 1021.5;

25 6. For costs of suit incurred herein; and

26 7. For such other and further relief that the court may deem just and proper.

119IHX3 Because, if everything goes as planned, the Main Range is getting torn down and replaced! This will be one of the biggest projects in recent Club history. And boy do we all know how bad it needs to

D happen. The building will be straightened out to provide for better
