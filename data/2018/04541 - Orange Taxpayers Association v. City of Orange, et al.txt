STATEMENT OF FACTS
The Project

13. Real Party owns a billboard located at 1936 E. Katella Avenue. The billboard is located
on the west side of the SR 55 Freeway. Currently, there are two posters on the billboard, one facing each
direction of the SR 55 Freeway. The current billboards are 20' x 60' in size. In or about 2017, Real

8 Party requested that Respondent approve the conversion of the billboard to a digital LED billboard.
14. Respondent's current zoning code does not allow for the construction of billboards. In
10 order for the conversion to take place, Respondent agreed to enter into the Agreement. As a condition of

11 approval, Respondent agreed to consider a change to Respondent's zoning code, which would be
considered at a date after the approval of the Agreement.
15. The Agreement includes a provision for Real Party to compensate Respondent for staff
time and the costs of preparing the Agreement and zoning code changes up to $20,000. In addition, the

15 Agreement includes an annual mitigation fee to Respondent of $1.8 million during the initial 25-year
16 term of the Agreement.

16. The billboard can be seen from residential properties on both sides of the SR. 55 Freeway
and the closest residences are over 400 feet away from the billboard. Respondent sent 346 notices to
19 property owners and tenants in the area adjacent to the billboard site.
Respondent Approves The Project

17. On November 14, 2017, Respondent's City Council approved the Agreement.

18: While the staff report did not state that any environmental review was done regarding the
Agreement, at the November 14, 2017 meeting of Respondent's City Council, the City Attorney stated
that CEQA does not apply to the Agreement. The City Attorney also stated that the Agreement was
exempt from CEQA.
19. On November 21, 2017, Respondent filed a Notice of Exemption.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

(Violation of CEQA)
[As Against All Respondents]
20. Petitioner incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 19 as though fully set forth

5 herein.

21. The approval of the Agreement ("Project") is a "project" under CEQA. CEQA requires
appropriate environmental review to be conducted by the lead agency prior to the approval and
implementation of the Project. Respondent is the lead agency under CEQA since it is the public agency
that approved the Project. Yet, Respondent has never conducted proper environmental review of the

10 Project. It has instead improperly and inconsistently found that the Project is (1) not subject to

L environmental review under CEQA, or (2) is subject to environmental review under CEQA but is exempt

12 from CEQA.

13 22. Petitioner is harmed by the continual violation of CEQA through the action to approve the
Project without Respondent furst having condueted proper environmental review.

15 23. Petitioner is suffering irreparable harm by having to continually protect its rights, the
16 rights of the public with respect to enforcement of CEQA, and causing an expenditure of scarce and

17 valuable judicial resources. Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, Petitioner is entitled
18 to temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief preventing Respondent from approving and
19 allowing the Project to go forward without first having conducted proper environmental review.
20 24. Petitioner seeks through this action to enforce important rights under the United States and
California Constitutions and statutory and other law that affect the public interest and that confer a
significant benefit on the public as a whole by protecting the environment of Respondent. Petitioner is
ineurring substantial expense in pursuing this matter, all of which are within the jurisdictional limit of
this Court. There is no monetary recovery sought or allowed in this action that would be available to
offset the expense of pursuing this action for Petitioner, As such, Petitioner is entitled to recover an
award of attorneys' fees pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.

4
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

(Violation of CEQA)
[As Against All Respondents]
25. Petitioner incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 24 as though fully set forth
herein,

26. Respondent has improperly found the Project is exempt from CEQA pursuant to the
various asserted exemptions.

27, The Project is not exempt under CEQA as there is no evidence to support Respondent's

9 determination that the Project is exempt. Moreover, any asserted exemption is not applicable as the

10 Project raises the reasonable possibility that a significant effect on the environment may occur and that
11 this possibility is due to unusual circumstances.

12 28. Petitioner is harmed by the continual violation of CEQA through the action to approve the
13 Project without the lead agency, Respondent, first having conducted proper environmental review.

14 29. Petitioner is suffering irreparable harm by having to continually protect its rights, the

15 rights of the public with respect to enforcement of CEQA, and causing an expenditure of scarce and

16 valuable judicial resources. Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, Petitioner is entitled
to temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunetive relief preventing Respondent from approving and
allowing the Project to go forward without first having conducted proper environmental review.

30. Petitioner seeks through this action to enforce important rights under the United States and

20 California Constitutions and statutory and other law that affect the public interest and that confer a
significant benefit on the public as a whole by protecting the environment of Respondent. Petitioner is
incurring substantial expense in pursuing this matter, all of which are within the jurisdictional limit of

23 this Court. There is no monetary recovery sought or allowed in this action that would be available to 24 offset the expepse of pursuing this action for Petitioner. As such, Petitioner is entitled to recover an
25 award of attorneys' fees pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.
26 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment against Respondent as follows:
27 1. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate, commanding Respondent to:

28 a. vacate and set aside the approval of the Project and immediately stop all further

5
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

activity on the Project that could result in an adverse change or alteration to the physical environment
until Respondent complies with the requirements of CEQA and all other applicable state and local laws,
policies, ordinances, and regulations as directed by this Court pursuant to Publio Resources Code section
22168.9; and

b. void all decisions rendered regarding the Project;

2. For temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief restraining Respondent from
taking any further actions regarding the Project until Respondent has fully complied with all
requirements of CEQA, and all other applicable state and local laws, policies, ordinances, and
regulations;

3. For costs of suit;
For an award of attorneys' fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5; and

S. For such other and further relief that the Court deems just and proper.
