PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 directing the State Water Board to comply with the United States and California Constitutions, the
2 Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act, CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, all requirements for
3 certified regulatory programs, and all other applicable laws, rules and regulations; and (5) a
4 judgment declaring that the State Water Board's adoption of the Phase 1 Amendments to the Bay-
5 Delta Plan is void and invalid, and that the Bay-Delta Plan is void and unenforceable.

6 I. INTRODUCTION

7 3. The Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act ("Porter-Cologne Act") requires the
8 State Water Board to adopt "water quality control plans" that protect the waters of the state for the

9 many beneficial uses to which those waters are put, including domestic use, municipal supply,
10 agricultural production, and the preservation of fish and wildlife resources. (Wat. Code, § 13000, et

11 seq.) Each water quality control plan must (1) identify the "beneficial uses" that will be protected
12 by the plan, (2) establish "objectives" that provide a reasonable level of protection for those
13 beneficial uses considering, among other things, all other beneficial uses to which those waters are
14 put, and (3) create a "program of implementation" needed to achieve those objectives. (Wat. Code,

15 §§ 13050[j], 13241, 13242.) The objectives - which are the regulatory component of the plan
16 must reflect the Board's balancing of all beneficial uses of water.

17 4. The State Water Board is required is to review its water quality control plans every

18 three years pursuant to the federal Clean Water Act. (33 U.S.C. § 1313[c][1].) This action and
19 proceeding pertains to the State Water Board's review and revision of its water quality control plan
20 for the San Francisco Bay-Sacramento/San Joaquin Delta Estuary (*Bay-Delta Plan").

21 5. The current review of the Bay-Delta Plan formally began in 2009 when the Board
22 issued a Notice of Preparation ("NOP") advising the public it would begin its review and update
23 process using a phased approach. Although the 2009 NOP identified the location of the proposed
24 project as being the entire Bay-Delta watershed, the SWB decided to split its update of the Bay-
25 Delta Plan into two geographic regions. Phase 1 focused on southern Delta salinity and San
26 Joaquin River flows (including tributaries to the San Joaquin River). According to the SWB, Phase
27 2 will focus on other elements of the Bay-Delta Plan, including Delta outflow and Sacramento
28 River inflow (including tributaries to the Sacramento River).

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

6. The Board described Phases 1 and 2 as being separate processes involving different
2 water quality objectives that can be developed and implemented independently of each other. This
3 description of the process a conflicts with a recent acknowledgment by the California Supreme Court
4 that "[p]ast experience has shown that piecemeal efforts to address the Bay-Delta's problems have
5 failed because those problems are interrelated and because conflicting interest groups and

6 stakeholders can block actions that promote some interests at the expense of others." (In re Bay-

7 Delta, etc., (2008) 43 Cal.4th 1143, 1165.)

8 7. Phases 3 and 4 of the updated process appear to be in a state of either

9 redevelopment or abandonment. Initially, the State Water Board described Phase 3 as the process

10 through which the Board would implement the changes from Phases 1 and 2 through water right

11 actions and other activities. The SWB described Phase 4 as the process through which the Board
12 would develop and implement flow objectives to address public trust needs on high priority

13 streams pursuant to the Delta Reform Act requirement that the Board "develop new flow criteria
14 for the Delta ecosystem necessary to protect public trust resources."(Wat. Code, § 85086[c][1].)
15 However, in the Board's most recent explanation of the phased update process, descriptions of
16 Phases 3 and 4 have disappeared and it is not clear whether these phases will occur.

17 8. Approximately four years after the SWB issued the 2009 NOP, it circulated a Draft
18 Substitute Environmental Document at the end of 2012 ("2012 Draft SED") in support of potential
19 changes to the Bay-Delta Plan for Phase 1. The proposed Phase 1 changes were restricted to the
20 San Joaquin River watershed and included a new narrative objective for the ostensible protection

21 of fish and wildlife on the San Joaquin, Tuolumne, Merced, and Stanislaus Rivers that would be
22 applicable from February through June. This new narrative objective was proposed by the Board as
23 a regulation to balance the need to protect fish and wildlife resources against the need to protect
24 other beneficial uses, including domestic use, municipal supply and agricultural production, among
25 many others. To achieve this new narrative objective, the Board stated that it would require 35
26 percent unimpaired flow from February through June from each of the Merced, Tuolumne, and

27 Stanislaus Rivers.

9. The SWB received approximately 4,000 comments on the proposed changes to the
2 Bay-Delta Plan and the 2012 Draft SED. However, the Board did not respond to the comments on
3 the 2012 Draft SED.

4 10. In September of 2016, the State Water Board released a "revised" substitute
a 5 environmental document, along with a set of new proposed changes to the Bay-Delta Plan. The
6 documents released by the Board in 2016 were significantly different from their 2012 counterparts,

7 except the proposed revisions were consistent insofar as they were geographically constrained to a
8 subset of waterways within the San Joaquin River watershed. Specifically, the Board proposed
9 adding, among other things, a new objective to the Bay-Delta Plan that would require range of

10 30% to 50% unimpaired flow from February through June on the Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and
11 Merced Rivers (tributaries to the San Joaquin River), with an initial 40% unimpaired flow
12 requirement. Given that the Board placed the unimpaired flow compliance points on the tributaries

13 and not the San Joaquin River, the numeric objectives could only be implemented by six major
14 water right holders in the entire San Joaquin River watershed, five of which are SJTA member
15 agencies. The Board also proposed a vague and sweeping narrative objective requiring that "inflow
16 conditions" be maintained "from the San Joaquin River watershed to the Delta" that are sufficient
17 "to support and maintain the natural production of viable native San Joaquin River watershed fish
18 populations migrating through the Delta." (2016 Draft SED, Appx. K, p. 18.)

19 11. The State Water Board used several computer simulation models to measure
20 impacts of the proposed project on water supply, water temperature, agricultural production, and

21 salmonid production numbers. However, the operational assumptions used in the modeling differ
22 drastically from the actual requirements of the water quality objectives.

23 12. The initial analysis performed by the State Water Board demonstrated that requiring
24 40% unimpaired flow from the Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers had an adverse and
25 devastating impact on, among other things, reservoir levels and instream water temperatures that
26 are important to the protection of certain fisheries. The State Water Board never publicly released
27 these initial modeling results which showed that requiring 40% unimpaired flow would harm fish

28 and wildlife beneficial uses.

4
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

13. To mitigate these adverse results, the State Water Board - through a trial and error
2 process - began internally to add operational constraints to the models. These modeling constraints
were not included in, or added to, the objectives, and, in fact, were contradictory to the unimpaired
4 flow objective in certain cases. For instance, to address the adverse impact that a 40% unimpaired
flow objective would have on reservoir storage (and by extension on cold water reserves needed to

6 influence instream temperatures for the benefit of certain fisheries), the Board incorporated an
7 operational constraint into the modeling that limited the level to which the major reservoirs on the

8 Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers could be reduced, setting a minimum reservoir

9 requirement. This constraint, known as carryover storage, is not required by the objectives in the
10 Bay-Delta Plan. However, the modeling of impacts assumes it is a requirement. Similarly, the
11 Board incorporated operational assumptions that diverge from the February-June 40% unimpaired
12 flow objective by shifting flows to other times of the year, outside the regulated February-June
13 time period. This modeling assumption, described by the Board as flow shifting, is not required by
14 the objectives. Rather, the flow shifting directly contradicts the 40% unimpaired flow objective by,
15 among other things, decreasing the percentage of unimpaired flow to less than 40% during the
16 months of February through June so that a portion of that water can be stored and then released at
17 other times of the year when it might be more beneficial to certain fishery resources.

18 14. The Board released this mitigated analysis to the public in a revised SED in 2016,
19 and later relied upon it when adopting the 40% unimpaired flow objective and the other Phase -
20 Amendments to the Bay-Delta Plan. Put simply, the Board modeled one project, but adopted

21 another.

22 15. Even with all the additional assumptions and constraints that were added to the
23 model to produce a result that did not adversely impact fish and wildlife resources, the Board's

24 analysis failed to show the objectives protect fish and wildlife resources. First, the Board focused

25 its a entire analysis on a single species of anadromous fish: Central Valley fall-run Chinook salmon.
26 The Board never analyzed protection of any other fish and wildlife resource. Second, under the
27 Board's own analysis, when compared to baseline conditions, the modeling (with all the
28 operational assumptions and constraints developed during the Board's iterative process) showed a

5
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

-

2 de minimis increase in average annual production of Central Valley fall-run Chinook salmon of
1,103. With average annual production in the Central Valley of more than 700,000, the projected
3 increase in production amounts to gain of approximately 0.15%, or less than quarter of 1
4 percent. The Board failed to analyze whether this de minimis increase amounted to a reasonable
5 "protection" of fish and wildlife resources.

6 16. By contrast, the modeling projects substantial adverse impacts on irrigated
7 agriculture. The Board's own analysis estimates the project will impact more than million acres

8

9 of agricultural land in the San Joaquin Valley, the majority of which (65%) is designated as Prime

10 or Unique Farmland, or Farmland of Statewide Importance. Of that 65%, the Board estimates the

11 project would convert more than 24,000 acres to non-agricultural use.

17. The Board also failed to assess the environmental and socioeconomic impacts to the
12 San Francisco Bay Area of San Francisco's most reasonably foreseeable method of compliance
a 13 with a 40% unimpaired flow objective on the Tuolumne River: increased rationing throughout the
14 service area of the Hetch Hetchy Regional Water System.

15 18. In response to the 2016 Draft SED and the 40% unimpaired flow objective, the
16 State Water Board received approximately 3,100 letters, amounting to about 10,400 comments,
17 from federal, state, and local agencies; elected officials; stakeholders; and members of the public.
18 In total, the Board received approximately 19,050 pages of material from the public commenting

19 on the proposed 1 Phase 1 Amendments. The comments covered an extensive range of topics, from
20 the water quality control planning process itself, to the environmental analysis, to the Board's
21 chosen alternatives, to the modeling (and the assumptions therein), to the results that showed a
22 meager benefit of 1,103 fish.

23 19. After approximately 1 year and 4 months, the Board published responses to the
24 numerous public comments. Despite the many critiques contained in the 19,050 pages of public
25 comment, the State Water Board did not make any changes to the substitute environmental

26 document.

27 20. The State Water Board did, however, make a handful of critical changes to the
28 project. Specifically, the Board added a completely new narrative objective which requires that the

6
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 flows provided to meet the 40% unimpaired flow objective from February through June be

2 managed in a manner to avoid causing significant adverse impacts to fish and wildlife beneficial
3  uses at other times of the year. The State Water Board failed to amend the SED to analyze the
4 impacts of this new objective.

5 21. The Board also provided extensive new analysis in its response to comments, but
6 declined to accept any public comment on that new analysis. The tactic of including new analysis

7 in the response to comments and claiming that the new information is not part of the SED was an
8 improper attempt to speed up the adoption process by avoiding recirculation and prohibiting public

9 critique of the new analysis. Indeed, the State Water Board limited the public comment period on
10 the new narrative objective and various other changes made to the Bay-Delta Plan in 2018 to a
11 mere 21 days.

12 22. On December 12, 2018, the State Water Board adopted the SED and Phase
13 Amendments to the Bay-Delta Plan.

14 23. The Board's adoption must be set aside for the following reasons, among others:

15 a. The Board's adoption of the Phase 1 Amendments was arbitrary, capricious,

16 and lacking in evidentiary support because the Board adopted a plan that

17 was entirely different from the plan it modeled and analyzed.

18 b. The Board's adoption of the Phase 1 Amendments was arbitrary, capricious,

19 and lacking in evidentiary support because the Board failed to analyze

20 whether the Phase 1 Amendments were reasonably protective of the

21 beneficial uses they were intended to protect, considering all other factors

22 and beneficial uses that must, by statute, be considered.

23 C. The Board's adoption of the Phase 1 Amendments is unlawful due to the

24 inclusion of a program of implementation that requires additional mandatory

25 actions, such as carryover storage, for the stated purpose of directly

26 protecting beneficial uses. By including actions in the program of
27 implementation for the purpose of directly protecting beneficial uses instead

28 of for the purpose of achieving objectives, the Board has violated the three-

7
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 step process required by the Porter-Cologne Act: (1) identify beneficial uses,

2 (2) establish objectives that provide a reasonable level of protection for

3 those beneficial uses considering all relevant factors and other beneficial

4 uses, and (3) create a program of implementation that describes the actions

5 necessary to achieve the objectives. By skipping the second step in this

6 process, the Board has unlawfully subverted the required balancing that

7 must be performed when establishing objectives that provide a reasonable

8 level of protection for the identified beneficial uses.
a c d. The Board's adoption of the Phase 1 Amendments is unlawful due to the
10 inclusion of a program of implementation that requires actions beyond those

11 necessary to achieve the objectives in violation of the Porter-Cologne Act.

12 e. The Board's adoption of the SED violated the California Environmental

13 Quality Act, Pub. Res. Code section 21000, et seq. ("CEQA"), by, among

14 other things, unlawfully segmenting the environmental review of the Bay-

15 Delta Plan update into two geographic phases and two separate

16 programmatic environmental documents.

17 f. The SED also fails to disclose, let alone evaluate, the predictable and

18 adverse environmental and socioeconomic impacts to the San Francisco Bay

19 Area from the updated Bay-Delta Plan, or identify effective measures to

20 mitigate them, and the document is therefore inadequate under CEQA, the
Y certified regulatory program associated with the State Water Board's water

22 quality control program (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 23, § 3777, et seq.), and the
23 Porter-Cologne Act.

24 g. The Board's adoption of the SED was not supported by substantial evidence

25 because the models relied upon by the Board to evaluate environmental

26 impacts do not accurately depict the project that was approved.

27 h. The Board's adoption of the Bay-Delta Plan violated the due process clauses

28 of the California and United States Constitutions because the Board limited

8
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 the project to only a select group of water right holders who can implement

2 the project, which amounts to an adjudication of water rights without the due

3 process protections required by an adjudication.

12
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 47. The SJTA, its member agencies, their landowners, and/or customers will be directly
2 and substantially affected by the adverse economic and environmental impacts of the State Water
3 Board's actions, which include, but are not limited to, impacts on agricultural resources, air

4 quality, biological resources, greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, water supply,

5 recreational resources, groundwater resources, hydropower resources, the urban forest (i.e., park

6 vegetation, landscaping and trees), housing development and sprawl, jobs and economic output,

7 and aesthetic resources.

8 48. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

9 unless this Court grants the requested injunctive relief and writ of mandate to require Respondent
10 to set aside its certification of the SED and adoption of the Phase 1 Amendments. Therefore,
11 Petitioners have standing to challenge the Phase 1 Amendments and the related SED.

12 V. EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

13 49. Respondent/Defendant State Water Board's adoption of the Phase 1 Amendments
14 and the Bay-Delta Plan is a final action and not subject to further administrative appeal procedures.

15 50. Respondent/Defendant State Water Board's adoption of the SED is final and not
16 subject to further administrative appeal procedures.

17 51. In accordance with Public Resources Code section 21177, subdivision (a),

18 Petitioners objected to the adoption of the SED orally and in writing during the period for public

19 comment provided under CEQA and before the filing of the notice of determination.

20 52. In accordance with Public Resources Code section 21177, subdivision (b), all
21 grounds for non-compliance with CEQA that are alleged herein were presented to
22 Respondent/Defendant State Water Board during the public comment period and before the filing

23 of the notice of determination.

24 53. Petitioners elect to prepare the record of proceedings pursuant to Code of Civil
25 Procedure section 1094.6(c) and Public Resources Code § 21167.6(e)(1)-(11), in accordance with
26 the notice of election filed concurrently herewith as Exhibit A.

27 54. Petitioners actively participated in the administrative process that culminated in the
28 State Water Board's adoption of the Phase 1 Amendments and the Bay-Delta Plan. Petitioners

13
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

raised procedural and substantive objections to the adoption of the Phase 1 Amendments by timely
2 submitting written comments to the State Water Board in March 2013, March 2017, and July 2018.
3 Petitioners and/or other parties have raised all of the factual and legal objections asserted in this
4 Petition/Complaint during the administrative proceeding.

VI. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

6 55. On or about December 12, 2018, the State Water Board adopted the SED and Phase
Amendments to the Bay-Delta Plan.

56. This Petition/Complaint is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code

9 section 21080.5(g) and Code of Civil Procedure section 338(i).

10 57. This Petition/Complaint is timely filed in accordance with Water Code section
11 1126.

12 VII. NOTICE OF CEQA SUIT AND NOTICE TO ATTORNEY GENERAL

13 58. Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by prior
14 service of notice upon the Respondent/Defendant indicating an intent to commence this action. The
15 notice and proof of service are attached hereto as Exhibit B.

16 59. Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of
17 Civil Procedure section 388 by sending a copy of this Petition/Complaint to the California
18 Attorney General. A copy of the letter transmitting this Petition/Complaint to the California
19 Attorney General is attached hereto as Exhibit C.

20 60. Petitioners request preparation of the record of proceedings pursuant to Public
21 Resources Code section 21167.6, subdivision (a), in accordance with the request filed concurrently
22 herewith as Exhibit A, referenced above.

23 VIII. PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE

24 61. Petitioners bring this action as a private attorney general pursuant to Code of Civil
25 Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important public rights
26 affecting the public interest.

27

28

14
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

62. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition/Complaint will confer a significant
2 benefit on a large class of persons who receive electricity, irrigation water, and municipal water
3 supply from the SJTA member agencies.

4 63. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition/Complaint will confer a significant

5 benefit on the general public by requiring the State Water Board, and its appointed officials, to

6 comply with the legislative mandate of CEQA and the Porter-Cologne Act.

7 64. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement are such as to make an award of
8 attorney's fees appropriate in this proceeding. The financial burden was great: Petitioners/Plaintiffs

9 submitted numerous comments, attended numerous hearings and workshops, met with other
10 interested parties and State Water Board staff and members, and spent considerable time preparing
11 and executing litigation. Enforcement was necessary to ensure that various public agencies and
12 citizens were not required to comply with invalid regulations and a project was not implemented
13 for which the environmental impacts were not analyzed.

14 IX. IRREPARABLE HARM

15 65. The SJTA and its member agencies are directly and irreparably harmed by the
16 Board's adoption of the Bay-Delta Plan. The Phase 1 Amendments constitute an unlawful

17 adjudication of the water rights of the STJA members agencies without due process of law. The
18 Bay-Delta Plan will cause substantial losses to the surface water supply relied upon by the SJTA

19 member agencies for agricultural production, municipal supply, recreational use, and hydropower
20 generation, among other things. Implementation will also cause direct impacts to groundwater

21 resources relied upon by the SJTA member agencies.

22 66. The SJTA and its member agencies will be irreparably harmed by the existence of
23 the regulation as other agencies rely on the objectives in place.

24 X. STANDARD OF REVIEW

25 A. Standard of Review for Adoption of Phase 1 Amendments and Bay-Delta Plan

26 67. "In performing its regulatory function of ... establishing water quality objectives,
27 the [State Water] Board acts in a legislative capacity." (United States v. State Water Resources
28 Control Bd. (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 82, 112.) When reviewing an administrative action that is

15
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 legislative in nature, a court "must proceed in ordinary mandamus" under Code of Civil Procedure
2 section 1085. (Patterson v. Central Coast Regional Com. (1976) 58 Cal.App.3d 833, 840.) A trial
3 court "reviews an administrative action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 to
4 determine whether the agency's action was [1] arbitrary, capricious, or entirely lacking in
5 evidentiary support, [2] contrary to established public policy, [3] unlawful, [4] procedurally unfair,

6 or [5] whether the agency failed to follow the procedure and give the notices the law requires."

7 (Vallejo Police Officers Assn. v. City of Vallejo (2017) 15 Cal.App.5th 601, 611; see California

8 Water Impact Network v. Newhall County Water Dist. (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1464, 1483; Am.

9 Canyon Fire Prot. Dist. v. County of Napa (1983) 141 Cal.App.3d 100, 106; Lewin v. St. Joseph
10 Hospital (1978) 82 Cal.App.3d 368, 386.) A court "exercises independent judgment in determining

11 whether the agency action was consistent with applicable law." (Neighbors in Support of
12 Appropriate Land Use v. County of Tuolumne (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 997, 1004 [internal
13 quotations and citations omitted].)

14 68. The State Water Board performs an adjudicatory function when it allocates water
15 rights. (United States v. State Water Resources Control Bd., supra, 182 Cal.App.3d at 113.) When
16 reviewing an administrative action that is adjudicatory in nature, "the court must proceed under
17 Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 ..' (Patterson, supra, 58 Cal.App.3d at 840.) "The

18 inquiry in such a case shall extend to the questions of whether the [agency] has proceeded without,

19 or in excess of, jurisdiction; whether there was a fair trial; and whether there was any prejudicial
20 abuse of discretion." (Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5[b].) "Abuse of discretion is established if the
21 [agency] has not proceeded in the manner required by law, the order or decision is not supported

22 by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the evidence." (Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5[b].)

23 If an agency's adjudicatory decision "substantially affects a fundamental vested right, [then] the
24 trial court must exercise its independent judgment on the evidence and find an abuse of discretion
25 if the findings are not supported by the weight of the evidence." (Patterson, supra, 58 Cal.App.3d

26 at 840, citing Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5[c].) If the adjudicatory decision does not affect a
27 fundamental vested right, then the court determines "whether the findings are supported by
28 substantial evidence in light of the whole record." (Patterson, supra, 58 Cal.App.3d at 840.) Water

rights are fundamental and vested property rights. (Fort Mojave Indian Tribe v. Department of
2 Health Services (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1574, 1591; see Arizona v. California (1963) 373 U.S. 546,
3 555 [under the law of prior appropriation, "the one who first appropriates water and puts it to
4 beneficial use thereby acquires a vested right to continue to divert and use that quantity of water
5 against all claimants junior to him [or her] in point of time"].)

6 69. Where an agency "in two capacities is simultaneously disposing of two legally
7 required functions with but one decision, review of that determination must be by the more
8 stringent standard." (Mountain Defense League v. Board of Supervisors (1977) 65 Cal.App.3d 723,

9 729.) Where uncertainty exists, the "prudent course" is to treat the act as adjudicative and apply the
10 stricter standard. (L&M Professional Consultants v. Ferreira (1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 1038, 1054.)

11 B. Standard of Review for Adoption of the SED (CEQA Standard of Review)

12 70. In determining whether to grant petition for traditional mandamus under Code of
13 Civil Procedure section 1085 on the ground that an agency has failed to comply with the California
14 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") in making a quasi-legislative decision, a court will consider
15 "whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion." (Western States Petroleum Assn. v. Superior
16 Court (1995) 9 Cal.4th 559, 568, quoting Pub. Resources Code, § 21168.5). "Abuse of discretion is
17 established if the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law or if the determination or
18 decision is not supported by substantial evidence." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21168.5)

19 71. The State Water Board's water quality control planning program is a certified
20 regulatory program that is exempt from the CEQA requirements of preparing an Environmental
21 Impact Report ("EIR") and/or a negative declaration, but the State Water Board must prepare a
22 substitute environmental document in lieu of an EIR. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21080.5; Cal. Code
23 Regs., tit. 14, § 15251.) Certified regulatory programs and SEDs are subject to all CEQA
24 requirements unless they are specifically exempted under Public Resources Code section 21080.5,

25 as well as "the broad policy goals and substantive standards of CEQA." (City of Arcadia v. State V.
26 Water Resources Control Bd. (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 1392, 1421-1422.)

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 XI. GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

2 A. SJTA Member Agencies

3 72. The SJTA is a joint powers authority comprised of TID, MID, OID, SSJID, and San

4 Francisco, the latter of which is acting by and through the San Francisco Public Utilities
5 Commission (SFPUC.)

6 1. Oakdale Irrigation District (OID) and South San Joaquin Irrigation District (SSJID)

73. OID and SSJID jointly hold adjudicated and decreed pre-1914 water rights on the
8 Stanislaus River entitling them to the first 1,816.6 cubic-feet/second ("cfs") of flow. OID and
9 SSJID also hold numerous water right licenses issued by the State Water Board entitling them to
10 divert and store water from the Stanislaus River.

11 74. The irrigation service areas for OID and SSJID are set forth in the SED. OID's
12 irrigation service area is situated, generally, on the north and south sides of the Stanislaus River,
13 downstream of Goodwin Dam. SSJID's irrigation service area is situated, generally, on the north
14 side of the Stanislaus River, to the west of OID's irrigation service area.

15 75. The United States Bureau of Reclamation ("USBR") owns and operates New
16 Melones Dam on the Stanislaus River. New Melones Dam has a storage capacity of approximately a

17 2.4 million acre-feet.

18 76. OID and SSJID own and operate - together with their cooperative venture the Tri-
19 Dam Project - Donnells Dam and Beardsley Dam on the Middle Fork of the Stanislaus River
20 upstream of New Melones Reservoir, and Tulloch Dam on the main stem of the Stanislaus River

21 downstream of New Melones Dam.

22 77. Goodwin Dam is located on the Stanislaus River approximately 59 miles upstream
23 of the Stanislaus River's confluence with the San Joaquin River, and approximately 2 miles
24 downstream of Tulloch Dam and 10 miles downstream of New Melones Dam. Goodwin Dam is
25 jointly owned by OID, SSJID, and Stockton East Water District.

26 78. OID and SSJID enterec into an Agreement and Stipulation, dated October 24, 1972
27 (*1972 Agreement"), with the United States of America, by and through the United States
28 Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Mid-Pacific Region, in the matter of USBR's

18
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 water right applications 14858, 14859, 19303, and 19304, through which USBR requested, among
2 other things, authorization from the State Water Board to construct and operate New Melones Dam

3 on the Stanislaus River. The 1972 Agreement recognized that USBR's construction of New
4 Melones Dam would inundate OID and SSJID's existing Melones Dam and Reservoir on the
5 Stanislaus River. Pursuant to the 1972 Agreement, OID and SSJID agreed to withdraw their
6 protests to USBR's water right applications 14858, 14859, 19393, and 19304, in exchange for,

7 among other things, USBR's agreement, in recognition of OID and SSJID's more senior water
8 rights, to deliver to OID and SSJID 654,000 acre-feet of water annually, or the total quantity of

9 New Melones Reservoir inflow during the water year, whichever is smaller.

10 79. On or about August 30, 1988, OID and SSJID entered another agreement ("1988
11 Agreement") with USBR, as a substitute to the 1972 Agreement, pursuant to which USBR agreed,
12 among other things, to deliver to OID and SSJID an amount of water equal to the total inflow to
13 New Melones Reservoir (measured in acre-feet), plus the amount derived by the following
14 formula: (600,000 acre-feet - total inflow in acre-feet)/3, but not to exceed a maximum delivery of
15 600,000 acre-feet of water each water year. The 1988 Agreement also granted OID and SSJID a
16 conservation account, permitting OID and SSJID to store a cumulative a total amount of 200,000
17 acre-feet in New Melones Reservoir.

18 80. OID provides water for irrigation to approximately 2,900 users on approximately
19 80,000 acres of farmland. OID also provides water for municipal purposes to 700 customers.

20 81. SSJID provides water for irrigation to approximately 3,000 users on approximately
21 57,000 acres of farmland. SSJID also provides water for municipal purposes to the cities of
22 Lathrop, Manteca, and Tracy.

23 2. Modesto Irrigation District (MID) and Turlock Irrigation District (TID)

24 82. MID and TID hold, among other rights, valid pre-1914 water rights, as well as
25 numerous licenses issued by the State Water Board and its predecessor agencies, entitling them to
26 divert water from the Tuolumne River for municipal, irrigation, power, and recreational purposes.

27 83. TID's irrigation service area is situated, generally, between the Tuolumne River to
28 the north, the Merced River to the south, and the San Joaquin River to the west.

19
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

84. TID and MID jointly own and operate New Don Pedro Reservoir on the Tuolumne
2 River, which has a storage capacity of approximately 2,030,000 acre-feet of water for irrigation,
3 hydroelectric generation, recreation, and flood control. TID and MID hold the FERC license to

4 New Don Pedro Dam, which is currently undergoing relicensing (FERC Project No. 2299).

85. Water released from New Don Pedro Reservoir is impounded and regulated by

6 LaGrange Dam and Reservoir approximately 2.5 miles downstream of New Don Pedro Reservoir,
and approximately 52 miles upstream of the Tuolumne River's confluence with the San Joaquin
River. LaGrange dam is the diversion point for TID and MID canals.

9 86. Pursuant to an agreement entered into between TID, MID, and San Francisco in
10 1966 (commonly referred to as the "Fourth Agreement"), San Francisco has a "water bank"
11 account in New Don Pedro Reservoir entitling San Francisco to a maximum water bank credit of
12 570,000 acre-feet, with an additional available credit of 170,000 acre-feet when flood control is not
13 required.

14 87. TID provides water for irrigation to approximately 4,500 users on approximately
15 145,000 acres of farmland.

16 88. TID's operation of New Don Pedro provides electricity to supply approximately
17 60,000 average households.

18 3. San Francisco

19 89. San Francisco holds pre-1914 appropriative water rights in the Tuolumne River that
20 support a prima facie diversion rate well over 400 million gallons per day ("mgd").

21 90. The SFPUC Regional Water System ("RWS") is the third largest supplier of water
22 for domestic and municipal purposes in California, providing water service to 2.7 million people in
23 San Francisco, Alameda, Santa Clara, San Mateo, and Tuolumne counties. The RWS provides
24 water directly to San Francisco's residents and to 26 "wholesale customers" in San Mateo, Santa
25 Clara, and Alameda counties- (cumulatively, "RWS Service Area"). Collectively, the 26

26

27

28 The RWS also provides water on a wholesale basis to Cordilleras Mutual Water Company ("MWC") and Groveland Community Service District ("CSD") in Tuolumne County. Cordilleras MWC relies entirely on the SFPUC for its
supply, and Groveland CSD relies on the SFPUC for the majority of its supply.

20
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 wholesale customers receive over 66% of the water delivered by the RWS. Of these 26 wholesale

2 customers, which are represented in matters related to the RWS by the Bay Area Water Supply and
3 Conservation Agency (*BAWSCA"), 13 rely on the SFPUC for 95% or more of their total water

4 supply, and 8 rely on the SFPUC for 100% of their total supply. The Tuolumne River provides

5 85% of the water supplied by the RWS.

6 91. The SFPUC has a perpetual obligation to supply its wholesale customers with up to

7 184 mgd annually, as memorialized in the SFPUC's 2009 Water Supply Agreement with its

8 wholesale customers. Although the SFPUC's wholesale customers do not currently use 184 mgd,

9 their demand is forecasted to reach that level by 2040. With limited exceptions for drought,
10 emergencies, and system maintenance, if the wholesale customers' demands increase to 184 mgd
11| because of population growth and/or their failure to obtain sufficient alternative water supplies, the
12 SFPUC is obligated to provide them with 184 mgd. The SFPUC also allocates an additional 81

13 mgd for "retail" demand within the City and County of San Francisco. Thus, an RWS demand of
14 265 mgd, as referred to here, reflects San Francisco's perpetual obligation to its wholesale
15 customers plus its in-city retail allocation, and is consistent with projected demand in the year 2040
16 attributable to forecasted population growth.

17 92. Prior to the most recent drought, in fiscal year 2012-2013, RWS annual demand was
18 223 mgd. Although demand dropped during the 2014-2016 drought to as low as 175 mgd,
19 deliveries increased to 179 mgd in fiscal year 2016-2017. In fiscal year 2017-2018, total RWS
20 deliveries increased to 196 mgd. The trajectory is clear: RWS demand is rebounding following the

21 drought and the removal of rationing requirements.

22 93. Water diverted from the Tuolumne River watershed makes up approximately 85%
23  of the water used to supply the RWS. The remaining 15% is diverted from the combined Alameda
24 and Peninsula watersheds (referred to collectively as the "local" watersheds). The RWS begins
25 with Hetch Hetchy Reservoir and O'Shaughnessy Dam, located in Yosemite National Park on the
26 main stem of the Tuolumne River. Two additional reservoirs in the Hetch Hetchy Region - Lake
27 Eleanor and Lake Lloyd (also called Cherry Reservoir) - collect water from the watersheds
28 northwest of Hetch Hetchy Reservoir on tributaries to the Tuolumne River.

21
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

94. San Francisco delivers water from Hetch Hetchy Reservoir to customers without
2 filtration because the water's high quality warrants a filtration exemption from the United States

3 Environmental Protection Agency (*U.S. EPA") and the State Water Board's Division of Drinking

4 Water ("DDW"). Hetch Hetchy Reservoir can store up to 360,400 acre-feet of water.

5 95. In the 1913 Raker Act (38 Stat. 242), Congress granted San Francisco rights-of-

6 way across federal lands for the Hetch Hetchy Project, and required San Francisco to bypass
7 certain flows to MID and TID in recognition of their senior water rights. San Francisco also
8 bypasses additional flow in recognition of other pre-1914 water rights held by MID and TID. The
9 Raker Act allows San Francisco to divert water from the Tuolumne River only during high flow
10 periods, i.e., when flows exceed the quantities specified in the Raker Act. During dry periods
11 when flows do not exceed the quantities specified in the Raker Act, the Act requires San Francisco
12 to bypass all flow to MID and TID. (Raker Act, §§ 9(b), 9(c).)

13 96. In 1966, San Francisco, MID, and TID entered into the "Fourth Agreement"
14 pertaining to the construction and operation of the Don Pedro Reservoir, which is owned and

15 operated by MID and TID. The Fourth Agreement incorporated the Raker Act's flow bypass
16 requirements and created a "water bank" in Don Pedro Reservoir to (1) ensure that San Francisco's
17 diversions under its pre-1914 appropriative water rights will not harm MID's or TID's senior pre-
18 1914 appropriative water rights, and (2) allow San Francisco to pre-pay to MID and TID water
19 released upstream to satisfy MID and TID's senior water rights.

20 97. The Fourth Agreement provides that if TID and MID "demonstrate that their water
21 entitlements, as they are presently recognized by the parties, are being adversely affected by
22 making water releases that are made to comply with Federal Power Commission3 license
23 requirements, and that the Federal Power Commission has not relieved them of such burdens, City

24 and Districts agree that there will be a re-allocation of storage credits so as to apportion such
25 burdens on the following basis: 51.7121% to City and 48.2879% to Districts." (Article 8, Fourth
26 Agreement [emphasis added].)

27

28
3 The Federal Power Commission, which was created by the Federal Power Act, was the predecessor to the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission.
22
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 98. The Board states it will implement the Phase 1 Amendments by 2022 "through
2 water right actions or water quality actions, such as Federal Energy Regulatory Commission

3 (FERC) hydropower licensing processes." (SED at K-28 [emphasis added].) FERC is currently

4 conducting a relicensing proceeding for the Don Pedro Hydroelectric Project. TID and MID, as

5 owners of the project, must obtain a Section 401 water quality certification from the State Water

6 Board as part of that process. If FERC incorporates the State Water Board's Section 401 water
7 quality certification, i.e., the 40% unimpaired flow objective on the Tuolumne River, in a new

8 license for the Don Pedro Project, San Francisco could, per the Fourth Agreement, be responsible
9 for contributing approximately 51.7% of the flows required under the Phase 1 Amendments.

10 99. San Francisco's Water System Improvement Program ("WSIP") is a $4.8 billion,
11 multi-year, capital program to upgrade the RWS and is approximately 96% complete. The WSIP
12 identifies delivery and drought reliability elements for meeting current demands in the RWS
13 Service Area during dry years, including a proposed water transfer of approximately 2 mgd from
14 TID and MID to San Francisco.

15 100: As required under CEQA, the San Francisco Planning Department prepared a
16 Programmatic Environmental Impact Report ("PEIR") for the WSIP that analyzed facility projects
17 at a program level and implementation of a water supply option at a project level. As the Board
18 recognizes in the SED at pp. 16-68, the PEIR rejected as infeasible the concept of San Francisco
19 relying on a new in-Delta diversion, concluding "since this alternative would have uncertain water
20 supply reliability and an unknown ability to reduce impacts on Tuolumne River resources, as well

21 as significant additional environmental impacts, it was eliminated from further consideration."
22 (WSIP PEIR, at 9-126 [emphasis added].)

23 101. As identified in the SFPUC's 2015 Urban Water Management Plan, the SFPUC
24 operates under a Water Shortage Allocation Plan that includes multiple stages of response to water
25 supply shortages, ranging from use of dry year water supplies (when available), to voluntary
26 customer water reductions, to enforced rationing. Under that plan, water demand in a single dry
27 year would initially be satisfied with water deliveries from storage and use of available dry year

28

23
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 supplies. As total system storage declines during a sequential year drought, however, it would be

2 necessary to impose mandatory rationing of 10 to 20%, even without the Phase 1 Amendments.

3 102. The SFPUC uses a hypothetical "design drought" as the basis for planning and
4 modeling of future water supply and rationing scenarios. The design drought consists of the 1987-

5 1992 drought, followed by an additional 2.5 years of dry conditions from the hydrologic record,
6 which includes the 1976-1977 drought. In modeling the water supply shortages that would result
7 from implementation of the Phase 1 Amendments, SFPUC applied the design drought using the

8 historical hydrology from 1921 through 2011.
9 B. Plan Bay Area

10 103. In 2013, the Association of Bay Area Governments ("ABAG") and the Metropolitan
11 Transportation Commission adopted Plan Bay Area 2013 in accordance with "The Sustainable
12 Communities and Climate Protection Act of 2008," (Stats. 2008, ch. 728, § 1; Stats. 2009, ch. 354,

13 § 5), also known as Senate Bill No. 375, which requires California's 18 metropolitan areas,

14 including the Bay Area, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cars and light trucks. The first

15 mandatory target requires the Bay Area to reduce its per-capita CO2 emissions from cars and light-
16 duty trucks by 7% by 2020 and 15% by 2035. The second mandatory target requires the Bay Area

17 to house 100% of its projected population growth.

18 104. Plan Bay Area 2013 projects that between 2010 and 2040, the nine-county Bay Area

19 will (1) grow in population from 7.2 million to 9.3 million, an increase of 2.1 million people, or
20 30%; (2) add 1.1 million jobs; and (3) increase its housing stock by 3.4 million new homes.

21 105. Plan Bay Area 2013 calls for the majority of projected growth to occur in Priority
22 Development Areas that are "transit-oriented, infill development opportunity areas within existing

23 communities" because "[c]ompact infill development can reduce vehicle use and vehicle miles
24 traveled by 20 to 60-percent when compared to traditional suburban developments." (Plan Bay
25 Area at 77, 123.)

26 106. ABAG adopted a revised regional growth forecast in February 2016. This forecast
27 estimates an additional 1.3 million jobs and 2.4 million people, and therefore the need for

28

24
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 approximately 820,000 more housing units between 2010 and 2040. This represents an increase of
2 15% in employment and a 25% increase in households, as compared to Plan Bay Area 2013.

3 C. Water Quality Control Plans

4 1. Water Quality Control Plans

5 107. The State Water Board is solely responsible for setting statewide policy concerning

6 water quality control (Wat. Code, § 13140-13147), and is authorized to formulate and adopt its
7 own water quality control plans which supersede conflicting regional basin plans. (Wat. Code,

8 con 13170.)

9 108. In formulating water quality control plans, the State Water Board is to "attain the
10 highest water quality which is reasonable, considering all demands being made and to be made on
11 those waters and the total values involved, beneficial and detrimental, economic and social,
12 tangible and intangible." (Wat. Code, § 13000.)

13 109. Water quality control plans must contain the following components for the waters
14 within a specified area: (1) beneficial uses to be protected, (2) water quality objectives, and (3) a
15 program of implementation needed for achieving water quality objectives. (Wat. Code, § 13050[j].)

16 110. The State Water Board must establish water quality objectives that ensure "the
17 reasonable protection of beneficial uses" considering, but not limited to, the following factors: (a)
18 past, present, and probable future beneficial uses of water; (b) environmental characteristics of the
19 hydrographic unit under consideration, including the quantity of water available thereto; (c) water
20 quality conditions that could reasonably be achieved through the coordinate control of all factors

21 which affect water quality in the area; (d) economic considerations; (e) the need for developing
22 housing within the region; and (f) the need to develop and use recycled waters. (Wat. Code,

23 § 13241.)

24
2. Water Quality Control Plans for the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San
25 Joaquin Delta Estuary (Bay-Delta Plan)

26 111. A comprehensive history of the State Water Board's efforts to develop water quality
27 control plans for the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary (Bay-Delta Plan) is

28 set forth in the following two appellate decisions: United States v. State Water Resources Control

25
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Bd. (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 82 ("Racanelli"); State Water Resources Control Bd. Cases (2006)
2 136 Cal.App.4th 674 (*Robie").* These cases resolved litigation over the State Water Board's

3 prior adoption/implementation of the 1978 Bay-Delta Plan and the 1995 Bay-Delta Plan.

4 112. The formerly applicable water quality control plan for the Bay-Delta estuary was

5 the State Water Board's Water Quality Control Plan for the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San

6 Joaquin Delta Estuary, dated December 13, 2006 (*2006 Bay-Delta Plan"). The 2006 Bay-Delta
7 Plan was adopted by SWB Resolution No. 2006-0098, and is implemented pursuant to the SWB's

8 Water Rights Decision 1641 ("D-1641").

9 D. Review and Update to the 2006 Bay-Delta Plan

10 1. State Water Board Delay in Pursuing an Update to the 2006 Bay-Delta Plan

11 113. In 1999, after a water right hearing to implement the 1995 Bay-Delta Plan, the State
12 Water Board adopted D-1641, which placed the sole responsibility of meeting all of the objectives

13 in the 1995 Bay-Delta Plan upon the California Department of Water Resources ("DWR") and the
14 United States Bureau of Reclamation ("USBR") as part of their respective operations of the State
15 Water Project (*SWP") and Central Valley Project ("CVP"). However, as part of the water right
16 hearing that led to D-1641, the Board also accepted the terms of settlement agreement known as
17 the San Joaquin River Agreement ("SJRA"). Pursuant to the SJRA, the responsibility for meeting
18 the April-May pulse flow objectives in the 1995 Bay-Delta plan was temporarily allocated to
19 certain water right holders in the watershed of the San Joaquin River (including SJTA member
20 agencies) for a twelve-year period - in exchange, effectively, for compensation from USBR.

21 During that twelve-year period, a study known as the Vernalis Adaptive Management Plan

22 ("VAMP") was to be conducted in order to, among other things, evaluate the effects of varying San
23 Joaquin River flow and SWP/CVP exports on the survival of juvenile chinook salmon migrating
24 through the Delta.

25

26

27 4 The opinion in United States v. State Water Resources Control Bd. was authored by Justice John T. Racanelli, and is
28 often identified simply as Racanelli. Accordingly, references to that case are short-cited in this Petition/Complaint as
Racanelli. Consistent with this reference, the opinion in State Water Resources Control Bd. Cases, authored by Ronald
B. Robie, will be short-cited in this Petition/Complaint as Robie.

26
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 114. In 2006, the Board made minor revisions to the 1995 Bay-Delta Plan to comply
2 with Justice Robie's decision in State Water Resources Control Bd. Cases, supra, 136 Cal.App.4th
3 674, resulting in the 2006 Bay-Delta Plan. Following the amendments, D-1641 remained the

4 implementing document for the 2006 Bay-Delta Plan. At that point, the VAMP study had been
5 ongoing for seven years, and was set to expire in approximately five years at the end of 2011.
6 Notably, after the expiration of the VAMP program, USBR has had a difficult time complying with

7 the flow objectives at the Vernalis compliance point. In fact, in recent communications to the State

8 Water Board, USBR stated it is no longer operating its facilities with the aim of meeting the

9 Vernalis flow objectives in the 2006 Bay-Delta Plan.

10 115. In 2008, the State Water Board adopted the 2008 Bay-Delta Strategic Workplan
11 which, among other things, prioritized the review and update of the Bay-Delta Plan.

12 116. In 2009, the State Water Board issued the Notice of Preparation and Scoping
13 Meeting for Environmental Documentation for the Update and Implementation of the Water
14 Quality Control Plan for the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary: Southern
15 Delta Salinity and San Joaquin River Flows (*2009 NOP"). As explained below, after the formal
16 review began, the Board's review process was repeatedly delayed due to inaction on the part of the

17 State Water Board.

18 2. The SWB's Unlawful Segmentation/Phasing of the Revisions to the 2006 Bay-Delta Plan
19
117. On or about February 13, 2009, the State Water Board issued the 2009 NOP,
20

21 formally advising the public it planned to pursue a phased approach to revising the 2006 Bay-Delta

22 Plan. Specifically, the 2009 NOP advised that the Board would begin preparing the environmental

23 documentation for updating only the "Southern Delta salinity" and "San Joaquin River flow

24 objectives" components of the Bay-Delta Plan. The Board stated that it would it begin "other

25 portions of the environmental documentation as soon as additional information is available." (2009
NOP, p. 2.)
26
118.
27 The Board it later explained that it was pursuing a four-phased approach to revising
the Bay-Delta Plan.

119. Phase of the process addressed revisions to the objectives/program of
2 implementation for San Joaquin River flows (including certain tributaries to the San Joaquin River)
3 and southern Delta salinity.

4 120. Phase 2 of the process would address/is addressing revisions to the remaining
5 objectives/program of implementation for the Bay-Delta Plan, including Delta outflow, Delta

6 inflow, and Sacramento River flows (including certain tributaries to the Sacramento River).

7 121. In addition to dividing its revisions of the Bay-Delta Plan into two separate

8 processes, the Board also divided its environmental review and analysis of the revisions into two

9 separate processes and two separate environmental documents.

10 122. Every draft of the SED the Board has issued for the Phase 1 Amendments has

11 assumed for purposes of review and analysis of impacts that the rest of the Bay-Delta Plan will
12 remain unchanged. In other words, the Board reviewed and analyzed the Phase 1 Amendments as

13 if the Phase 2 Amendments did not exist.

14 123. Similarly, the Scientific Basis Report that the SWB adopted in 2017 for the Phase 2
15 revisions assumed - for purposes of analysis - that the Phase 1 revisions had not occurred, and that
16 San Joaquin River contributions to the Delta would remain unchanged. In other words, the Board
17 reviewed and analyzed the Phase 2 Amendments as if the Phase 1 Amendments did not exist.

18 124. The Board itself recognized the problem with segmenting the review of the Bay-
19 Delta Plan by acknowledging in a Fact Sheet for a the Scientific Basis Report that "[t]he Bay-Delta
20 watershed is an inextricably linked ecosystem - from streams where native fish spawn through to
21 the ocean." (Fact Sheet for Phase II Update of the Bay-Delta Plan: Inflows to the Sacramento River

22 and Delta and Tributaries, Delta Outflows, Cold Water Habitat and Interior Delta Flows, p. 6.)

23 125. Phases 3 and 4 of the process are in a state of redevelopment or abandonment. The
24 SWB described Phase 3 as the process through which the Board would implement the changes
25 from Phases 1 and 2 through 1 water right actions and other activities. The SWB previously
26 described Phase 4 as the process through which the Board would develop and implement flow
27 objectives to address public trust needs on high priority streams pursuant to the Delta Reform Act
28 requirement that the Board "develop new flow criteria for the Delta ecosystem necessary to protect

28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 public trust resources" (Wat. Code, § 85086[c][1]), and further pursuant to the Delta Stewardship

2 Council's directive in the Final Delta Plan (2013), that the Board adopt flow objectives for high-
3 priority tributaries in the Delta watershed by June 2018.

4 126. In the Board's most recent explanation of the phased update process, Phases 3 and 4

5 have disappeared.

6 3. 2012 Draft SED and 2012 Revised Bay-Delta Plan

7 127. On or about December 31, 2012, the State Water Board released its "Draft

8 Substitute Environmental Document in Support of Potential Changes to the Water Quality Control

0 Plan for the Bay Delta: San Joaquin River Flows and Southern Delta Water Quality" (hereinafter
10 the "2012 Draft SED").

11 128. The 2012 Draft SED purported to analyze the environmental impacts associated
12 with Phase 1 Amendments. (2012 Draft SED, p. 1-1.) The 2012 Draft SED stated that the
13 environmental impacts associated with Phase 2 would be evaluated in a separate environmental
14 document.

15 129. The 2012 Draft SED dispensed with the SJR Flow Objective at Vernalis and
16 narrative objective for the protection of salmon contained in the 1995 and 2006 Bay Delta Plans,
17 and replaced them with Lower San Joaquin River Fish and Wildlife Flow Objectives (hereinafter

18 the "2012 Draft LSJR Flow Objectives").

19 130. The 2012 Draft LSJR Flow Objectives included: (a) an objective requiring 1,000 cfs
20 flow at Vernalis on the San Joaquin River during the month of October (2012 Draft SED, Appx K,

21 at of 11); and (b) a new narrative objective (hereinafter the "2012 Draft Narrative Objective")

22 (2012 Draft SED, Appx K, at 1 of 11.)

23 131. The program of implementation for the 2012 Draft LSJR Flow Objectives required
24 "35 percent of unimpaired flow…from February through June from each of the Merced,
25 Tuolumne, and Stanislaus Rivers on a 14-day running average..." (2012 Draft SED, Appx K, at 3
26 of 11.)

27 132. The program of implementation for the 2012 Draft LSJR Flow Objectives divided
28 up the responsibility for meeting the 1,000 cfs October Vernalis objective; specifically, it provided

29
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

"the Merced shall provide 24 percent, the Tuolumne 47 percent, and the Stanislaus 29 percent of
2 the flow needed to achieve base flow of 1,000 cfs at Vernalis..." (2012 Draft SED, Appx K, at 3

3 of 11 through 4 of 11.)

4 133. The program of implementation noted that the required "35 percent unimpaired
5 flow…required from February through June from each of the Merced, Tuolumne, and Stanislaus

6 Rivers" is "in addition to flows from the LSJR from sources other than the Merced, Tuolumne, and
7 Stanislaus Rivers." However, no other sources or required flows were named and/or discussed.
8 (2012 Draft SED, Appx K, at 3 of 11.)

9 134. The SWB received more than 4,000 comments on the 2012 Draft SED and the
10 proposed revisions to the Bay-Delta Plan, including comments from the SJTA and its member

11 agencies.

12 135. The Board did not recirculate the 2012 Draft SED for nearly four years after

13 accepting public comments.

14 4. The 2016 Proposed Phase 1 Amendments and the 2016 Draft SED

15 136. On or about September 15, 2016, the State Water Board recirculated a revised Draft
16 SED and a draft of the proposed Phase 1 Amendments to the Bay-Delta Plan.

17 137. The 2016 proposed amendments included significant changes to the plan area, the
18 water quality objectives and the program of implementation to achieve those objectives.

19 a. The Plan Area

20 138. In 2016, the Board revised the Plan Area to make it much smaller, including only a
21 minor portion of the San Joaquin River watershed. Specifically, the Phase 1 Amendments only
22 target the waters of the Merced, Tuolumne, and Stanislaus Rivers. Waterways/water users

23 exempted from the objectives include the mainstem of the San Joaquin River upstream of its
24 confluence with the Merced River, the Kings, Fresno, and Chowchilla Rivers which can flow to the

25 San Joaquin River, the Calaveras, Mokelumne, and Cosumnes Rivers, the water users on the
26 westside of the San Joaquin River, and water users in the Sacramento River watershed and the
27 Bay-Delta estuary.

28

30
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

b. Water Quality Objectives

2 139. In 2016, the Board proposed to create new objectives with compliance points on

3 three of the tributaries to the San Joaquin River which had never before been directly targeted by
4 the Bay-Delta Plan.

5 140. Specifically, the Phase 1 Amendments contained a new objective for the ostensible

6 protection of fish and wildlife, requiring as follows: "[a] percent of unimpaired flow between 30%

7 50%, inclusive, from each of the Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers shall be maintained

8 from February through June" based upon a minimum 7-day running average flow rate. (2016 Draft

9 995 SED, Appx. K, p. 18.) This objective is referred to herein as the "Tributary UIF Objective."s

10 141. The State Water Board defines unimpaired flow as "the natural water production of

11 a river basin, unaltered by upstream diversions, storage, or by export or import of water to or from
12 other watersheds." (2016 Draft SED, Appx. K, p. 20.)

13 142. The Phase Amendments also included a significant change to the flow
14 requirement at Vernalis. The 2006 Bay-Delta Plan required specific base flows (measured in cfs)
15 dependent upon the water year classification (e.g., wet, dry, critical). These base flow requirements
16 could vary from as low as 710 cfs (in critically dry years) to 3,420 cfs (in wet years). In addition,
17 the 2006 Bay-Delta Plan also required specific pulse flows at Vernalis during certain times in April

18 and May; those flows could vary from as low as 3,110 cfs (in critically dry years) to as high as
19 8,620 (in wet years). By contrast, the Phase 1 Amendments require much lower flows, and no pulse
20 flow: "a minimum base flow value between 800 - 1,200 cfs, inclusive, at Vernalis shall be
21 maintained [on the San Joaquin River] at all times during February through June." (2016 Draft

22 SED, Appx. K, p. 18.) The program of implementation for this objective states that when the
23 percentage of unimpaired flow requirement on the Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers is
24 insufficient to meet this objective, the Stanislaus shall provide 29%, the Tuolumne 47%, and the
25 Merced 24% of the additional total outflow needed to achieve and maintain the required base flow.

26

27 5 The term "Tributary UIF Objective" is used throughout this Petition/Complaint to refer to the version of the objective
28 proposed in 2016, as well as the modified version later proposed and adopted by the Board in 2018, which requires as follows: "Maintain 40% unimpaired flow, with an allowed adaptive range between 30% and 50%, inclusive, from each
of the Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers from February through June."

31
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

The effect of such implementation would be that additional water from the Stanislaus, Tuolumne,
2 and Merced Rivers - beyond the amount required by the Tributary UIF Objective - would be

3 required to meet the Vernalis requirement, most likely in dry or critically dry years. This objective

4 is referred to herein as "Vernalis Base Flow Objective."6

5 143. By targeting only the Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers in the San Joaquin

6 River watershed, and by placing the compliance points below each of the rim dams on those three

7 rivers, the State Water Board created objectives which can only be implemented and/or enforced
8 against a select group of water users that have diversion facilities downstream of the rim dams and

9 upstream of the compliance points on the Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers. Thus, by their
10 very design, Tributary UIF Objectives require senior water right holders on the Stanislaus,
11 Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers to meet flow requirements, while simultaneously exempting
12 countless other junior water rights holders within the San Joaquin River watershed and throughout
13 the entire Bay-Delta watershed.

14 144. The Phase 1 Amendments also contained a new narrative objective for the
15 ostensible protection of fish and wildlife. The narrative objective required as follows: "Maintain
16 inflow conditions from the San Joaquin River watershed to the Delta at Vernalis sufficient to

17 support and maintain the natural production of viable native San Joaquin River watershed fish
18 populations migrating through the Delta. Inflow conditions that reasonably contribute toward
19 maintaining viable native migratory San Joaquin River fish populations include, but may not be
20 limited to, flows that more closely mimic the natural hydrographic conditions to which native fish
21 species are adapted, including the relative magnitude, duration, timing, and spatial extent of flows
22 as they would naturally occur. Indicators of viability include population abundance, spatial extent,

23

24

25

26 The term "Vernalis Base Flow Objective" is used throughout this Petition/Complaint to refer to the version of the

27 objective proposed in 2016, as well as the modified version later proposed and adopted by the Board in 2018, which
requires as follows: "At all times during February through June, the flow at Vernalis, as provided by the percent of

28 unimpaired flow objective, shall b now lower than the base flow value of 1,000 cfs with an allowed adaptive management range between 800 - 1,200 cfs, inclusive.

32
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

distribution, structure, genetic and life history diversity, and productivity." (2016 Draft SED,
2 Appx. K, p. 18.) This objective is referred to herein as the "Inflow Narrative Objective."7

3 145. The Phase 1 Amendments fail to explain how the Tributary UIF Objective relates to
4 the Inflow Narrative Objective, or to the Vernalis Base Flow Objective.

5 c. Program of Implementation

6 146. The SWB also made substantial changes to the program of implementation (*POI")

7 to implement the Phase Amendments.

8 147. The POI contains several provisions that do not serve the purpose of implementing

9 any objectives, but rather of modifying the objectives without Board approval and a properly
10 noticed hearing.

11 148. The POI states that the Tributary UIF Objective and the Vernalis Base Flow
12 Objective will be implemented by requiring 40% unimpaired flow, based on a minimum 7-day

13 average, from each of the Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers.

14 149. The POI allows the SWB, or the Executive Director of the SWB under certain

15 conditions, to make the following "adaptive adjustments" to the Tributary UIF Objective:

16 a. The required percent of unimpaired flow can be adjusted to any value

17 between 30% and 50%.

18 b. The required percent of unimpaired flow for February through June can be

19 managed as a total volume of water and released on an adaptive schedule

20 that is different from what would occur by tracking the unimpaired flow

21 (referred to as "flow shaping").

22 C. The release of a portion of the February through June unimpaired flow can

23 be delayed until after June to prevent adverse effects to fisheries, including

24 temperature, that would otherwise result from implementation of the

25 February through June flow requirements (referred to as "flow shifting").

26

27

28 1 The Inflow Narrative Objective that was proposed in 2016 did not change when the SWB responded to comments in 2018. However, the Board added a second narrative objective, which is explained below.

33
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 d. The Vernalis Base Flow Objective can be adjusted to any value between 800

2 and 1,200 cfs.

3 150. The "adaptive adjustments" are identified as measures for implementing the

4 Tributary UIF Objective, the Vernalis Base Flow Objective, and an additional October pulse flow
5 objective. However, these adaptive adjustments do not achieve those objectives; they change those

6 objectives.

7 151. The adaptive adjustment that allows for flow shaping is not an activity needed to
8 achieve the objectives. Instead, it is an activity that allows for the modification of the Tributary
9 UIF Objective by changing the unimpaired flow component and the 7-day running average
10 component of that objective. Allowing the required percentage of water to be treated as a total

11 volume of water and released on an undetermined adaptive schedule, as opposed to bypassed
12 and/or released in accordance with a specific percentage of unimpaired flow measured based on a
13 7-day running average, conflicts with the Tributary UIF Objective itself.

14 152. The adaptive adjustment allowing for flow shifting is not an activity needed to
15 achieve the objectives. Instead, it is an activity that allows for the modification of the Tributary
16 UIF Objective by changing the unimpaired flow component, the 7-day running average
17 component, and the temporal scope of that objective from February through June to other times of
18 the year. Allowing for the release of a portion of the February through June unimpaired flow to be
19 delayed until after June first requires that the percentage of February through June unimpaired flow
20 be treated and managed as a total volume of water instead of bypassed/released in accordance with
21 a specific percentage of unimpaired flow. It then requires that portion of that total volume of
22 water be held in a reservoir and released at some time other than February through June. This

23 operation conflicts with the Tributary UIF Objective itself.
24 153. The POI also requires the Board, when implementing the objectives, to create and
25 impose minimum reservoir carryover storage targets or other requirements to ensure that providing
26 flows to meet the flow objectives will not have significant adverse temperature or other impacts on
27 fish and wildlife or, if feasible, on other beneficial uses. This requirement is referred to herein

28 "Carryover Storage."

34
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

154. The Carryover Storage requirement is not an activity needed to achieve the
2 objectives. Instead, it is a requirement embedded in the POI intended to avoid the adverse effects

3 that will be caused by adherence to the Tributary UIF Objective. Any requirement established for
4 the purpose of protecting a beneficial use must be developed as a water quality objective, a process

5 which requires the Board to establish a reasonable level of protection considering all the other uses

6 to which the water is put. By embedding the Carryover Storage requirement in the POI for the
7 ostensible purpose of directly protecting beneficial uses, rather than developing the requirement as
8 a balanced objective, the Board has subverted the balancing requirement in the Porter-Cologne

9 Act.

10 155. The POI does not include description of any actions necessary to achieve the
11 Inflow Narrative Objective.

12 156. The POI requires the Board to establish a Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced
13 Working Group ("STM Working Group") to assist with the implementation, monitoring, and
14 effectiveness assessment of the February through June LSJR flow requirements.

15 157. The POI requires the Board to establish "Biological Goals" that will be used to
16 inform the adaptive methods and to evaluate the effectiveness of the program of implementation.
17 The Board will not consider approval of the biological goals before the adoption of the plan itself,
18 but rather within 180 days from the date the Office of Administrative Law approves the
19 I amendments to the plan. The POI states that reasonable contribution to the biological goals may
20| include meeting temperature targets and other measures of quality and quantity of spawning,
21 rearing and migration habitat, fry production, and juvenile outmigrant survival to the confluence of

22 each tributary to the San Joaquin River.

23 158. The POI fails to specify how compliance with the Tributary UIF Objective will be
24 measured, thereby failing to describe a critical action necessary to achieve the objective. Instead,
25 the POI states that implementation of the Tributary UIF Objective will require the development of
26 information and specific measures to achieve the flow objectives and to monitor and evaluate
27 compliance. These measures were not to be considered for approval by the Board until after the

28 plan itself was adopted.

35
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

159. The POI failed to specify a procedure for implementing the adaptive adjustments,

2 and instead delegated this responsibility to the STM Working Group, or State Water Board staff as
3 necessary. The procedures for implementing the adaptive adjustments were not to be considered
4 for approval by the Board until after the plan itself was adopted.

5
d. The SED did not Evaluate the Project Adopted by the
6 State Water Board

160. The SED did not model or analyze the same objectives adopted by the SWB.

161. Instead, the SWB used a trial and error approach, which it referred to as an iterative

9 process, to arrive at and present the results of multiple computer simulation models showing a
10 single example of how the system could operate given certain constraints. However, the
11 operational constraints used in the modeling are inconsistent with the objectives that the SWB
12 proposed and adopted in several critical ways. In the SED, the Board acknowledged that some of
13 those constraints do not comprise a plan of implementation or otherwise carry the weight of
14 regulatory requirements.
15 162. The State Water Board used the Water Supply Effects ("WSE") model to assess the
16 impacts of the Phase 1 Amendments on water supply.
17 163. The State Water Board used the Statewide Agricultural Production ("SWAP")
18 model to assess the impacts of the Phase 1 Amendments on agriculture; SWAP relied on inputs and
19 results from the WSE model.
20 164. The model used by the State Water Board to assess the impacts of the Phase 1
21 Amendments on salmonid production was the SalSim model, which relied on inputs and results
22 from the WSE model.

23 i. WSE Modeling Constraints

24 165. The WSE model assumes the implementation of multiple operational constraints
25 that are not required by any of the objectives and, in certain cases, are inconsistent with the
26 objectives.
27 166. Specifically, the WSE model assumes that when the required unimpaired flow
28 percentage for the Tributary UIF Objectives is set at 40% or higher, some of the required instream

36
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 flows (not to exceed 25% of the total quantity of instream flow required from the months of

2 February through June) will be shifted to the months of July through November, mostly in water

3 years classified as wet. This assumption is referred to herein as "WSE Flow Shifting." The purpose

4 of WSE Flow Shifting is to mitigate the adverse effects on reservoir levels and instream water
5 temperatures that will result from requiring 40% (or more) unimpaired flow, to show a reduced

6 likelihood of negative effects on fish and wildlife, and to show an increase in the overall potential

7 benefit that is not present when the Tributary UIF Objectives are modeled without the WSE Flow

8 Shifting.

9 167. The WSE Flow Shifting is not required by any of the objectives.

10 168. The WSE Flow Shifting is inconsistent with the Tributary UIF Objective insofar as

11 (1) it diverges from the unimpaired flow regime and requires the percentage of unimpaired flow
12 from February through June to be managed as a total a volume of water; (2) it requires the
13 maintenance of flows outside the February through June time period covered by the Tributary UIF
14 Objectives; and (3) it reduces the amount of unimpaired flow required during the February through

15 June period to a lower percentage than would otherwise be required by the Tributary UIF
16 Objective.

17 169. The WSE model includes Carryover Storage requirements that restrict New
18 Melones Reservoir (on the Stanislaus River), New Don Pedro Reservoir (on the Tuolumne River),
19 and Lake McClure (on the Merced River) from being drawn below certain levels. Similar to the
20 WSE Flow Shifting, the Carryover Storage requirement was included in the WSE model to
21 minimize the impact on instream temperature that would otherwise be caused by the lowering of

22 reservoir levels and the reduction of coldwater reserves through the implementation of the
23 Tributary UIF Objective.

24 170. Carryover Storage is not required by any of the objectives.

25 171. The WSE model includes operational constraints that restrict reservoir withdrawals
26 when the required unimpaired flow percentage is 40% or higher if reservoir levels are below a
27 certain predetermined point ("Refill Criteria").

28 172. Refill Criteria is not required by any of the objectives.

37
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

173. The Refill Criteria was included in the WSE model so that reservoir levels and

2 coldwater reserves recover more quickly after a drought, thereby minimizing adverse temperature
3 impacts that would otherwise be caused by the Tributary UIF Objectives.

4 174. The WSE model assumes that current operations will continue and assumes these
5 operations as a "minimum base flow." For example, there are current requirements, contained in
6 licenses issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC"), and reasonable and
7 prudent alternatives set forth in biological opinions issued as part of Section 7 consultation under

8 the federal Endangered Species Act, that may require more flow than the Tributary UIF Objectives.

9 These existing flow requirements are referred to as "Minimum Base Flows."

10 175. Minimum Base Flows are not required by any of the objectives.

11 176. The WSE model is a monthly model, wherein required flows are calculated on a
12 monthly basis and remain static over the course of an entire month. Specifically, the February
13 through June minimum instream flow requirement is calculated in the WSE model as a percentage
14 of that month's unimpaired flow, for each month in February through June.

15 177. None of the objectives require that flows be calculated on monthly basis.

16 178. The WSE's monthly model smooths out the fluctuation in flows required by the
17 daily running average of the Tributary UIF Objectives and the Vernalis Flow Objective, and fails

18 to accurately reflect the impacts of those objectives insofar as they require the maintenance of a
19 percentage of unimpaired flow based on a daily running average.

20 179. All of these operational constraints were developed as part of the SWB's iterative
21 process for modeling the objectives in a way that did not adversely affect the beneficial uses that
22 the objectives were intended to protec By including all of these operational constraints in the
23 modeling which are not required by the objectives themselves, and which conflict with the
24 objectives in certain circumstances, the Board has not analyzed the actual impact of the objectives
25 and has not developed any modeling results that can be used to determine whether the level of
26 protection provided by the objectives is reasonable.

27

28

38
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

ii. SWAP Model

2 180. The SWAP model incorporates the results and modeling from the WSE model.

3 181. The SWAP model assumes that agricultural decisions will be market based, but it

4 fails to include all reasonably foreseeable market factors. The SWAP model relies only on

5 commodity pricing to form assumptions as to which crops will be fallowed, but it fails to consider

6 the secondary value that crops such as alfalfa and pasture have on cattle and dairy sectors.

7 182. The SWAP model assumes that all lower value crops will be fallowed before higher
8 value crops through intra-district water transfers. However, individual farmers rarely hold water

9 rights separate and apart from irrigation districts. Certain irrigation districts do not allow intra-
10 district water transfers. The SWAP model did not determine which irrigation districts permit such
11 transfers and which preclude such transfers. The SWAP model did not assess how the agricultural
12 community would be impacted given the restrictions on intra-district water transfers.

13 183. The SWAP model does not disclose the commodity pricing and yield production
14 numbers used. Without such information, the SWB could not assess whether the model correctly
15 valued crops, whether it properly determined which crops would be fallowed, or whether it
16 properly assessed the number of acres fallowed.

17 184. The SWAP model does not consider multiple-year impacts. Specifically, the

18 SWAP model only considers the impacts to a single year of agriculture and does not consider the
19 impacts of multiple-year water supply reductions. The WSE Model reflects that the Phase
20 Amendments will result in reductions in water supply in almost every year, with significant multi-
21 year reductions during drought cycles.

22 185. The SWAP model obscures the analysis of significant or potentially significant
23 environmental impacts, and artificially inflates the benefits of the Phase 1 Amendments by
24 improperly assessing the impact on agriculture.

25 iii. SalSim Model

26 186. The State Water Board used the SalSim model to analyze the impacts of the
27 objectives on salmonid production.

28

39
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- 187. The SalSim model assumes that 25% of the required unimpaired flow from
2 February through June is shifted to the months of September through December in all water year
3 classifications. This assumption is referred to herein as "SalSim Flow Shifting." The SalSim Flow
4 Shifting was used to provide temperature control, to reduce the likelihood of negative effects on

5 fish and wildlife, and to show an increase in the overall potential benefit that is not present when
6 the Tributary UIF Objectives are modeled without the WSE Flow Shifting.

7 188. SalSim Flow Shifting is not required by any of the objectives.

8 189. SalSim Flow Shifting is inconsistent with the Tributary UIF Objectives insofar as
9 (1) it diverges from the unimpaired flow regime and requires the percentage of unimpaired flow

10 from February through June to be managed as a total volume of water; (2) it requires the
11 maintenance of flows outside the February through June time period covered by the Tributary UIF

12 Objectives; and (3) it reduces the amount of unimpaired flow required during the February through
13 June period to a lower percentage than would otherwise be required by the Tributary UIF
14 Objective.

15 190. SalSim Flow Shifting was also developed as part of the SWB's iterative process for
16 modeling the objectives in a way that did not adversely affect the beneficial uses that the objectives

17 were intended to protect.

18 5. The SED's Analysis Fails to Analyze the Impacts of San Francisco's Most
Reasonably Foreseeable Method of Compliance with the Phase 1 Amendments: 19 Increased Water Rationing.
20 191. The SED is required to identify any significant or potentially significant adverse
21 environmental impacts, analyze reasonable alternatives and mitigation measures to avoid or reduce
22 any significant or potentially significant adverse environmental impacts, and analyze the
23 environmental impacts of the reasonably foreseeable methods of compliance. (Cal. Code Regs., tit.
24 23, § 3777(b)(2-4).) Further, the Board's analysis of the reasonably foreseeable methods of
25 compliance must assess a reasonable range of environmental, economic, and technical factors.

26 (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 23, § 3777(c).)

27 192. CEQA similarly mandates that when an agency adopts a rule, regulation, or
28 performance standard, it must analyze the reasonably foreseeable methods of compliance for the

1 rule, regulation, or performance standard. (Pub. Res. Code, § 21159.) This environmental analysis
2 must consider environmental, economic, and technical factors. (Pub. Res. Code, § 21159(c-d).)

3 193. The SED fails to analyze the environmental and economic impacts of the most

4 reasonably foreseeable method of compliance by San Francisco with the Phase 1 Amendments:

5 reduction of water deliveries throughout the RWS Service Area. Assuming a reoccurrence of the

6 1987-1992 drought and that San Francisco was responsible for bypassing 51.7% of the additional

7 flow on the Tuolumne River required by the 40% unimpaired flow objective,& San Francisco's

8 water supply would be reduced by 129,884 acre-feet per year, or approximately 116 mgd,' for each

Q of the six years of drought. A reduction of 116 mgd in each year of such a drought would require

10 San Francisco to impose unprecedented levels of mandatory rationing as follows:

11 a. Assuming RWS demand of 223 mgd, which was the pre-drought demand in

12 fiscal year 2012-2013, the SFPUC would be compelled to impose a 39%

13 reduction in deliveries during the first three years of the drought and a 49%

14 reduction in deliveries the following three years.

15 b. Assuming RWS demand of 265 mgd, which reflects the SFPUC's maximum

16 contract obligations and is consistent with projected RWS demand in 2040,

17 the SFPUC would be compelled to impose a 40% reduction in deliveries for

18 the first year of the drought, a and a 54% reduction in deliveries in each of the

19 subsequent five years.

20 A. The SED Fails to Analyze the Environmental Impacts of Water
21 Rationing Within the RWS Service Area.
194.
22 Increased rationing throughout the RWS Service Area, and the consequent

23 reduction in outdoor water use and resulting loss in park vegetation, landscaping, and trees (the

24

25 The analysis in this Petition assumes a 51.7% flow contribution by San Francisco. As a water supply provider to 2.7
million people throughout the Bay Area, San Francisco must utilize worst-case scenarios for water supply planning 26 purposes. In presenting the potential water supply, environmental, and socioeconomic effects from certain interpretations of the Raker Act and the 1966 Fourth Agreement San Francisco does not waive arguments it may have 27 about how the Raker Act or Fourth Agreement should or will be interpreted in future proceedings before the State Water Board, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, courts of competent jurisdiction, or in any other context.
28 The SED incorrectly states San Francisco's water supply would be reduced by 119,000 acre-feet per year or 106 mgd
under this scenario.

41
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 urban forest) would result in significant environmental impacts that the SED did not analyze,
2 including but not limited to the following:

3 i. Adverse impacts to cultural, aesthetic and recreational resources. The loss of vegetation

4 in parks and other public and private outdoor spaces throughout the RWS Service Area

5 would have an adverse effect on aesthetic resources and result in reduced use and

6 enjoyment of those areas.

7 ii. Increased risk of urban wildfires. Heightened levels of rationing and water use

8 restrictions would result in parched vegetation and desiccated trees, thereby increasing fire

9 hazards within and adjacent to urban areas in the RWS Service Area.

10 iii. Adverse impacts to habitat. Degradation of urban forests and other natural areas within

11 the RWS Service Area would decrease habitat for wildlife, including threatened and

12 endangered species.

13 iv. Effects on energy consumption, human health, water quality, air quality and greenhouse

14 gas emissions from exacerbation of urban heat islands. Increased water rationing and water

15 use restrictions in the RWS Service Area will result in intensification of urban heat islands.

16 Intensification of urban heat islands has the potential to increase energy consumption,

17 elevate levels of air pollutants, and exacerbate health impacts.

18 195. Increased rationing throughout the RWS Service Area would also impact
19 development in the RWS Service Area and potentially disrupt the pattern of compact, urban

20 growth called for in Plan Bay Area. This potential disruption could push new development to
21 areas outside the Bay Area with more reliable dry-year and future water supplies. The SED does
22 not assess the significant environmental impacts that could result from such sprawl: increased
23 greenhouse gas and other air pollutant emissions as a result of more vehicle miles travelled and the
24 loss of open spaces and forests, which function as carbon sinks; land use impacts resulting from
25 loss of open space and agricultural land due to sprawling development; increased erosion, flooding,
26 and water quality impacts associated with the development of open spaces; and greater per capita
27 water consumption as a result of increased population growth in sprawling developments with
28 higher per capita water usage, as compared to urban infill developments.

42
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

l B. The SED Fails to Identify or Assess the Phase 1 Amendments' Conflict
with State and Local Plans Promoting Green Infrastructure.
2

3 196. The adverse environmental impacts of severe water supply rationing in the RWS

4 Service Area contradict state and local plans promoting green infrastructure.
197. Numerous state and local policies encourage green infrastructure, i.e., landscaping

6 and open space areas, in order to provide social and environmental benefits, including improved

7 water quality and groundwater recharge.

198. Increased water rationing would have the effect of degrading landscaping and open

9 spaces in the RWS Service Area. The SED fails to identify, discuss, and reconcile the
10 inconsistencies with applicable state and local plans that promote green infrastructure.

11 199. The SED also fails to disclose, let alone discuss, the Phase 1 Amendments'
12 inconsistency with Plan Bay Area as mandated by CEQA Guidelines section 15125(d).

13 C. The SED Fails to Analyze the Economic Impacts of Water Rationing.

14 200. By failing to acknowledge the need for increased rationing throughout the RWS

15 Service Area, the SED also fails to consider severe economic impacts to San Francisco and its
16 retail and wholesale customers in the Bay Area resulting from such rationing in violation of the

17 Board's certified regulatory program and CEQA. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 23, § 3777(c); Pub. Res.
18 Code, § 21159(c); Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15187(d).)

19 201. The magnitude of rationing would be far too severe for the RWS residential sector
20 and dedicated irrigation sector to bear alone, and thus, the commercial and industrial sectors would

21 be directly affected.10 The resulting loss in jobs and economic output across the Bay Area during a
22 sequential-year drought, such as the 1987-1992 drought, would be significant:

23 a. A loss of 445,907 jobs and loss in economic output of over $116 billion,

24 assuming RWS pre-drought demand of 223 mgd.

25 b. A loss of 657,316 jobs and loss in economic output of over $234 billion,

26 assuming RWS demand of 265 mgd.

27

28
10 Rationing up to approximately 20-30% in the RWS Service Area can be absorbed solely by cuts to the residential sector and dedicated irrigation.
43
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

202. Implementation of the Phase 1 Amendments would also result in rate increases for
2 the SFPUC's customers, who already pay some of the highest water rates in California. The
3 SFPUC and its wholesale customers recover fixed costs through volumetric rates. When water

4 sales fall due to rationing, water rates must increase to recover fixed costs and balance water utility
budgets. Under the Phase 1 Amendments, assuming maximum contract deliveries of 265 mgd, San

6 Francisco would need to raise its rates by 7% and the wholesale customers would need to increase
7 their rates by 9% just to recover the expected reduction in water sales. At the same time, the
8 SFPUC's customers would be subject to additional water rate increases of unknown magnitude to

9 fund the development of alternate water supplies to make up for the significant reductions in RWS
10 deliveries caused by the Phase Amendments.

11 203. The SED also fails to consider, in violation of Water Code section 13241(d), that
12 implementation of the Phase 1 Amendments would result in a substantial reduction in San
13 Francisco's hydropower generation and associated revenue. San Francisco generates electricity
14 when it releases water from Hetch Hetchy Reservoir for delivery to the Bay Area, primarily via

15 Canyon Power Tunnel and Kirkwood Powerhouse. Therefore, rationing the delivery of water to
16 the RWS reduces San Francisco's hydropower generation. San Francisco estimates that the
17 economic impact of foregone hydropower sales alone due to the implementation the Tributary UIF
18 Objective on the Tuolumne River would be approximately $2 million per year for each successive

19 year of a protracted drought.

20 6. The SED's Three Proposed Methods of Compliance by San Francisco Are Not

21 Supported by Substantial Evidence.
204. Although the SED concedes that the project may require San Francisco to
22 significantly curtail its diversions from the Tuolumne River during a sequential-year drought, the
23 Board did not analyze any of these reasonably foreseeable adverse environmental and economic
24 impacts from water rationing. Instead, the SED unreasonably assumes that the SFPUC will not
25 need to increase rationing because San Francisco will be able to develop and/or procure sufficient
26 replacement water supplies through three methods of compliance identified in the SED: (1) large-
27 scale water transfers from MID or TID; (2) a large-scale desalination plant at Mallard Slough; and
28 (3) in-Delta diversion.

44
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

A. Large-Scale Water Transfers from MID or TID to San Francisco Are Unprecedented and Not Reasonably Foreseeable.
2 205. The State Water Board's assumption that San Francisco will be able to purchase the
3 requisite volume of replacement water from MID and/or TID is not supported by substantial
4 evidence and the analysis of environmental and economic impacts associated with such water
5 transfers is inadequate.
6 i. There is No Historical Support for Such a Transfer.
7 206. The SED estimates that under the Phase 1 Amendments, the SFPUC would
8 experience a water supply deficit of 119,000 acre-feet per year, or 106 mgd, during a six-year
drought based on the historic hydrology from the 1987-1992 drought. SFPUC's modeling shows
10 the reduction would actually be 129,884 acre-feet per year, or 116 mgd. But even assuming the
11 119,000 acre-feet per year estimate were correct, MID and TID have never transferred anything
12 close to that volume of water to any other entity, especially during a protracted drought. Given
13 that such a large-scale water transfer to San Francisco is unprecedented, it cannot be considered a
14 reasonably foreseeable method of compliance by San Francisco with the Phase 1 Amendments.
15
ii.
16 It is Not Reasonably Foreseeable that MID or TID Would Agree to Export Water During a Protracted Drought.

17 207. The State Water Board's assumption that, following implementation of the Phase

18 Amendments, TID or MID would willingly sell water to San Francisco that is needed within their

19 own respective service areas in the midst of a protracted drought is pure speculation that ignores

20 recent history. Specifically, the SED's assumption ignores that San Francsico tried and failed to

21 negotiate a relatively small water transfer, i.e., 2 mgd, from MID or OID during the most recent

22 drought. In addition, this assumption ignores persistent local opposition in Stanislaus County to

23 water transfers to San Francisco. Because the Phase 1 Amendments will only exacerbate dry year

24 water supply reductions, the likelihood of any such transfers is even more remote.

25 208. The SED assumes MID and TID will increase their current levels of groundwater

26 pumping in order to facilitate a large-scale transfer of surface water to San Francisco. But this

27 assumption contradicts the SED's own conclusion that the current level of groundwater pumping in

28 the Modesto and Turlock subbasins is already unsustainable.

45
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F 209. The Board's reliance on increased groundwater pumping also ignores the potential

2 limitation on groundwater pumping within TID and MID that may result from implementation of

3 the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, Water Code sections 10720, et seq. ("SGMA"),

4 a and a recently enacted groundwater management ordinance in Stanislaus County that restricts out-

5 of-county transfers of groundwater or pumping to replace surface water, and similar groundwater
6 management ordinances that counties throughout the Central Valley have enacted.

7 iii. The SED improperly relies on the WSIP PEIR's environmental
8 analysis of a 2 mgd transfer with the Districts.

9 210. The SED's reliance on the WSIP PEIR's environmental analysis of a 2 mgd transfer
10 with MID and TID to analyze the environmental impacts of a much larger transfer that could
11 involve groundwater substitution is improper.

12 211. First, as discussed above, under the Phase 1 Amendments San Francisco could face

13 a reduction of 116 mgd per year during a protracted drought, which is exponentially more water
14 than the proposed 2 mgd transfer that the SFPUC analyzed in the WSIP PEIR.

15 212. Second, the potential 2 mgd transfer analyzed in the WSIP PEIR involved solely the
16 use of conserved water, not a transfer of surface water to be replaced by groundwater substitution,
17 as contemplated in the SED. Given these dramatic and material differences between the 2 mgd
18 transfer analyzed in the PEIR and the massive transfer contemplated by the SED, the SED's
19 reliance on the PEIR analysis is inaccurate, misleading, and wholly inadequate.

20
iv. The SED's assumed purchase price for a large scale transfer has
21 no reasonable basis.

22 213. While acknowledging that the assumed purchase price of water transfers "is key to
23 the analysis" of economic impacts of such transfers (SED at 20-48), the SED fails to provide any
24 evidentiary support for its assumptions about the probable price of water transfers under its
25 proposal.

26 B. Large-Scale Desalination Plant at Mallard Slough Is Not Reasonably
Foreseeable.
27 214. There is no evidence supporting the SED's conclusion that San Francisco could
28 mitigate, even partially, the 129,884 acre-feet/year deficit that it could experience under the Phase

46
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- 1 Amendments through the development of a large-scale (56,000 acre-feet per year) desalination
2 plant located in Mallard Slough.

3 215.

4 The SED relies on the feasibility, environmental, and economic analyses of two

5 disparate projects  the Bay Area Regional Desalination Project ("BARDP") and Poseidon
Desalination Facility in Carlsbad ("Carlsbad Desalination Plant")-and fails to take into account
6 newly enacted legal requirements that apply to desalination plants in California.

7 216.

8 The Board's reliance on prior analyses of the BARDP is misplaced because those

9 site-specific analyses contemplated a much smaller facility that produces no more than 22,400
AF- -less than half the production capacity of the 56,000 acre-feet per year plant the SED posits.
10 And even then, the BARDP analyses fail to address numerous, unresolved potential feasibility

11

12 concerns. Further, the only available analyses of the BARDP are preliminary and incomplete.

217. The Board's reliance on the 2015 EIR for the Carlsbad Desalination Plant and other

13 findings related to the plant is also inadequate because those analyses address facility located in a
14 disparate geographic area with a distinct source water intake. The SED does not describe in any

15 detail, or draw any conclusions about, the geographical differences between the San Francisco
16 Bay-Delta and coastal Carlsbad, and how these differences might affect impacts of a similarly
17 sized facility at Mallard Slough. For example, important potential impacts of a Mallard Slough
18 facility overlooked by the SED are those associated with brine discharge into the already stressed

19 Delta ecosystem, as opposed to into the ocean.
20 218. Further, the Board's reliance on prior analyses of the BARDP and the Carlsbad
21 Desalination Project is misplaced because those analyses predate, and thus fail to take into account,
22 State regulatory requirements enacted in 2015 that apply to all new desalination projects in
23 California.

24 219. The SED also fails to analyze the economic impacts of a 56,000 acre-feet year
25 desalination plant at Mallard Slough, thereby violating the requirements of the certified regulatory
26 program for the Board's water quality control planning program and Public Resources Code section
27 21159.

28

47
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 220. The SED fails to assess any potential rate impacts associated with the costs of
2 constructing and operating a large-scale desalination plant. The Board does not even attempt to

3 estimate the capital costs associated with the envisioned Mallard Slough facility, instead
4 suggesting that construction costs would total somewhere within the broad range of $168 million to

5 $1 billion. The SED also fails to consider annual energy costs, which, for the comparably sized
6 Carlsbad Desalination Project, are approximately $50 million/year.

7 C. The In-Delta Diversion Project Is Not Reasonably Foreseeable.

8 221. Finally, the Board's assumption that San Francisco would be able to obtain

O replacement water through the development of an in-Delta diversion project identified in the SED
10 unreasonably relies on the SFPUC's prior determination in the WSIP PEIR that the same project

11 was infeasible. The SED offers no additional analysis, facts, or explanation as to why this project
12 should now be considered feasible.

13 222. The SED also fails to analyze the economic impacts of the in-Delta diversion

14 project that the Board envisions, and thereby violates the requirements of the certified regulatory
15 program for the Board's water quality control planning program and Public Resources Code
16 section 21159. For example, the SED fails to assess any potential rate impacts associated with the
17 in-Delta diversion project, and does not even attempt to estimate the cost of compliance associated

18 with the in-Delta diversion project envisioned by the Board.

19 7. The SED's Treatment of Municipal Water Service Providers is Inconsistent.

20 223. The SED's inconsistent treatment of municipal water service providers also results

21 in an unstable project description and deficient impact analysis.

22 224. The SED fails to present a clear description of the project because it fails to clarify

23 the extent to which municipalities are responsible for complying with the Tributary UIF Objective.

24 225. The SED's explanation of whether and how various municipal water providers may
25 be required to comply with the State Water Board's proposal is confusing, internally inconsistent,
26 and impermissibly scattered throughout various chapters and appendices.

27 226. Although the SED posits that San Francisco may be responsible for implementing
28 the proposed unimpaired flow requirement (SED at L-4), the impacts to San Francisco would be

48
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 "substantial" (id. at 13-60), and substantial reductions of existing surface water supplies constitute
2 an adverse impact (id. at 13-49), the SED nevertheless fails to identify, let alone analyze, the

3 adverse environmental and economic impacts to the Bay Area that could result from the Board's
4 implementation of the Phase 1 Amendments.

5 227. The SED thereby avoids any comprehensible, substantive discussion in the project

6 description or elsewhere in the SED of how the Phase 1 Amendments may impact San Francisco-

7 and many other potentially affected municipal water service providers-by leapfrogging over an

8 analysis of the impacts that would result from the proposed draconian water supply reductions.

9 228. The SED simply assumes the SFPUC will not need to reduce deliveries to the RWS
10 Service Area but instead will be able to replace the reduction in water supply from alternative

11 sources. This approach avoids analyzing the predictable, adverse impacts to the Bay Area.

12 8. The SFPUC Alternative to the Phase 1 Amendments.

13 229. In its written comments to the Phase 1 Amendments and SED, San Francisco
14 included a proposal for Tuolumne River ecosystem improvements that would meet fishery
15 protection goals on the river without the significant environmental and economic impacts to the
16 Bay Area that would result under the State Water Board's proposal ("SFPUC Alternative").

17 230. The SFPUC Alternative is comprehensive proposal for the management of

18 salmonids in the lower Tuolumne River based on Tuolumne River-specific studies and relevant

19 scientific literature. San Francisco's proposal is designed to expand the fall-run Chinook salmon
20 and O.mykiss populations in the lower Tuolumne River and maintain water supply reliability for

21 users of the Tuolumne River.

22 231. The SFPUC Alternative includes a schedule of instream flow releases from Don

23 Pedro Reservoir designed to improve habitat conditions by serving specific ecological functions,
24 e.g., spring pulse flows to increase outmigration success of fall-run Chinook salmon in the river,
25 and proposes non-flow measures to improve existing physical habitats, reduce the detrimental
26 effects of non-native predators on salmonids, and reduce undesirable effects of current hatchery
27 practices on the lower Tuolumne River fall-run Chinook population.

28

49
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

232. Following San Francisco's submission of the SFPUC Alternative to the State Water
2 Board in March 2017, San Francisco continued to work with MID and TID to improve the
3 alternative. Consequently, on November 30, 2017, MID and TID filed an Amended Final License

4 Application ("AFLA") with FERC for the Don Pedro Hydroelectric Project which contains the
5 "Tuolumne River Management Plan." The Districts submitted the AFLA to the State Water Board
6 as an attachment to their July 26, 2018 comments. The Districts provided the majority of the

7 underlying studies to the State Water Board as attachments to their March 2017 comments.

8 233. Similar to the SFPUC Alternative, the Tuolumne River Management Plan would

9 strategically release water down the Tuolumne River to support critical salmonid life stages. These
10 releases, which include functional flows like fall flushing flows, gravel mobilization flows, and
11 snowmelt recession hydrograph shaping, would work in concert with other measures to help

12 restore fish populations. The SFPUC Alternative and the Tuolumne River Management Plan are
13 based on the same site-specific studies of the Tuolumne River fishery.

14 234. The Board did not provide an adequate response that matched the level of detail of
15 the SFPUC Alternative or the Tuolumne River Management Plan, or the numerous scientific
16 studies that San Francisco, TID, and MID relied on to develop these proposals in the Board's
17 responses to comments on the Phase 1 Amendments and the SED.

18 235. In fact, the Board completely ignored the evidence of the fishery benefits that would
19 be attained under the SFPUC Alternative or the Tuolumne River Management Plan, as documented

20 in the numerous scientific studies submitted by TID and MID. stating "there is no evidence of the
21 efficacy of non-flow measures to protect fish and wildlife beneficial uses, the amount of water that

22 would be saved through the non-flow measures, or how the non-flow measures would achieve the

23 plan amendments' goals and objectives described in Chapter 3, Alternatives Description." (SED,
24 Master Response 5.2 at 6 [emphasis added].)

25 9. Public Comments on the Phase 1 Amendments and SED

26 236. The SJTA and its member agencies provided extensive written comments on the
27 SWB's 2016 Proposed Amendments and 2016 Draft SED in March 2017.

28

50
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 237. The State Water Board also received approximately 3,100 letters, amounting to

2 about 10,400 comments, from federal, state, and local agencies; elected officials; stakeholders; and
3 members of the public. In total, the Board received approximately 19,050 pages of material during
4 the public comment period. The comments covered an extensive range of topics, from the water
5 quality control planning process itself, to the environmental analysis, to the Board's chosen

6 alternatives, to the modeling (and the assumptions therein), to the results that showed a benefit of

7 1,103 fish.

8 10. SED, Final Phase 1 Amendments, and the State Water Board's
Response to Public Comments
9
238.
10 In July 2018, the Board published its responses to the public comments in which the

11 Board provided significant new information and analysis. Despite these changes, the Board would
further written comments on
12 not accept any the SED and response to comments.
239. In addition, the Board changed the Tributary UIF Objective from requiring a range
13

14 between 30% and 50% unimpaired flow to requiring exactly 40% unimpaired flow with an

15 adaptive range between 30% and 50%.

240.
16 The Board also added completely new narrative objective which requires that the

17 flows provided to meet the 40% unimpaired flow objective from February through June be

18 managed a in a manner to avoid causing significant adverse impacts to fish and wildlife beneficial

19 uses at other times of the year. This objective is referred to herein as the "Year-round Objective."

20 The Board did not analyze the impacts of the Year-round Objective (which expands the temporal

21 scope of the objectives from February-June to year-round) in the SED.

11.
22 State Water Board's Deficient Response to Public Comments
241. Pursuant to the State Water Board's certified regulatory program, "[t]he board shall
23 prepare written responses to the significant environmental issues raised in the comments received
24 during the written comment period, including written comments, and oral comments received at
25 the public hearing if the public hearing is held prior to the close of the written comment period."
26 (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 23, § 3779.)
27 242. The State Water Board is required to respond to public comments on the SED.

F 3779(d).)

2 243. The Board's July 6, 2018 response failed to provide a good faith, reasoned analysis

3 in response to comments on the SED by the SJTA and its member agencies as required by CEQA.

4 244. Specifically, the final SED:

5 a. Fails to explain why the Tributary UIF Objectives only pertain to

6 February-June, despite the Board's SalSim model showing the greatest

7 increase in the number of fish when a significant portion of the February -

8 June water is shifted to fall (September - December);
a b. Fails to acknowledge that the results from SalSim undercut the Board's
10 premise that more flow equals more fish;
11 C. Ignores the fact that the Tributary UIF Objectives will eliminate the ability

12 to store water and operate reservoirs as they were designed to operate;

13 d. Fails to fully acknowledge that the operations depicted in its modeling (e.g.,

14 carryover storage, flow shifting etc.) rely on a level of foresight that does not

15 exist in real world reservoir operations;

16 e. Fails to analyze impacts to the Bay Area from increased water supply

17 rationing;

18 f. Fails to use San Francisco's eight-and-a-half year design drought in its

19 modeling of water supply impacts;

20 g. Fails to use the SFPUC's more precise hydrological modeling results of

21 impacts to the RWS;

22 h. Fails to substantively consider the SFPUC's methodology for estimating

23 socioeconomic impacts from increased rationing;

24 i. Erroneously relies on the SFPUC's long-term planning documents to

25 establish the alleged availability of alternative water supplies in the near

26 term;

8 12. Framework Document

9 245. At the same time that the State Water Board released the SED, the Final Phase 1

10 Amendments, and the response to comments, it also released a document entitled "July 2018

11 Framework for the Sacramento/Delta Update to the Bay-Delta Plan" ("Framework Document").

12 246. The Framework Document described the State Water Board's proposed process to

13 update the remainder of the Bay-Delta Plan with a focus on the Sacramento River and its

14 tributaries, the Delta eastside tributaries (including the Calaveras, Cosumnes, and Mokelumne

15 rivers), Delta outflows, and interior Delta flows, known as Phase 2.

16 247. The Framework Document purports to explain how the Phase update and the

17 Phase 2 update relate to one another.

18 248. The Framework Document includes, among other things, an "Inflow-Based Delta

19 Outflow Objective" that provides as follows: "The inflows required above, including for the

20 Sacramento/Delta tributaries and San Joaquin River are required as outflows with adjustments for

21 downstream natural depletions and accretions."

22 13. State Water Board's Adoption of the SED and Bay-Delta Plan

23 249. On December 12, 2018, the State Water Board adopted the SED and the Phase

24 Amendments to the Bay-Delta Plan.

1 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 Writ of Mandate - Adoption of the Phase 1 Amendments was arbitrary, capricious,

3 and/or lacking in evidentiary support (Code of Civ. Proc., § 1085)
The SWB's determination that the Phase 1 Amendments provide reasonable
4 protection - as required by Water Code § 13000 and § 13242 - was arbitrary, capricious, and lacking in evidentiary support
5
250. Petitioners reallege and incorporate herein, as if set forth in full, each and every 6

7 preceding allegation, inclusive, of this Petition/Complaint.

251.
8 The Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act § (Wat. Code, § 13000, et seq.)
(hereinafter "Porter-Cologne Act") provides that the State Water Board shall regulate activities
9

10 affecting water quality "to attain the highest water quality which is reasonable, considering all

11 demands being made on those waters and the total values involved, beneficial and detrimental,

12 economic and social, tangible and intangible." (Wat. Code, § 13000.)

252.
13 The mechanism provided to the State Water Board for protecting water quality is the

14 "water quality control plan." (Wat. Code, §§ 13170, 13240.)

253.
15 A water quality control plan must include (1) the identification of beneficial uses to

16 be protected by the plan; (2) a set of objectives that ensure the reasonable protection of those

17 beneficial uses; and (3) a program of implementation needed for achieving those objectives. (Wat.

18 Code, §§ 13050[j], 13241, 13242.)

254. When setting water quality objectives, the State Water Board must consider, at a
19

20 minimum, the following factors: (1) past, present and probable future beneficial uses of water; (2)
environmental characteristics of the hydrographic unit under consideration, including the quality of
21

22 water available thereto; (3) water quality conditions that could reasonably be achieved through the
coordinated control of all factors which affect water quality in the area; (4) economic
23
considerations; (5) the need for developing housing within the region; and (6) the need to develop
24
and use recycled water. (Wat. Code, § 13241.)
25
255.
26 The Tributary UIF Objective requires the maintenance of 40% unimpaired flow, with

27 an allowed adaptive range between 30% and 50%, on each of the Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and
Merced Rivers from February through June, based upon a minimum 7-day running average.
28

54
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

256. The SWB relied on the modeling analysis and results in the SED to evaluate whether
2 the Tributary UIF Objective provided reasonable protection to the identified beneficial uses in the
3 Bay-Delta Plan considering all other demands being made on those waters affected by the Tributary
4 UIF Objective, and the total values involved, beneficial and detrimental, economic and social,
5 tangible and intangible, as required by Water Code section 13000.

6 257. The SWB relied on the modeling analysis and results in the SED to evaluate,

7 pursuant to Water Code section 13241; (1) past, present and probable future beneficial uses of
8 water; (2) environmental characteristics of the hydrographic unit under consideration, including the

9 quality of water available thereto; (3) water quality conditions that could reasonably be achieved

10 through the coordinated control of all factors which affect water quality in the area; (4) economic
11 considerations; (5) the need for developing housing within the region; and (6) the need to develop
12 and use recycled water.

13 258. The modeling results were developed through an iterative process that assumes the
14 implementation of operational constraints and rules not required by the objectives in the Bay-Delta
15 Plan, including flow shaping, flow shifting, minimum reservoir carryover storage, reservoir refill
16 criteria, and minimum base flows.

17 259. In addition, the SED evaluates only monthly flows and water temperature results,
18 despite the requirement that unimpaired flow be maintained on a minimum 7-day running average.

19 260. The State Water Board's determination that the objectives provided reasonable
20 protection to the identified beneficial uses considering all other demands being made on the waters
21 involved, and all other factors required by Water Code section 13000, was arbitrary, capricious, and
22 entirely lacking in evidentiary support because the SED did not accurately depict implementation of
23 the objectives due to the inclusion of operational assumptions that are not required by the
24 objectives, and due to the use of monthly modeling for objectives that require daily changes.

25 261. The State Water Board's determination that the objectives were reasonable
26 considering all the factors set forth in Water Code section 13241 was arbitrary, capricious, and
27 entirely lacking in evidentiary support because the SED did not accurately depict the
28 implementation of the objectives due to the inclusion of operational assumptions that are not

55
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 required by the objectives, and due to the use of monthly modeling for objectives that require daily

2 changes.

3 262. Because the State Water Board's decision to adopt the objectives was arbitrary,
4 capricious, and/or entirely lacking in evidentiary support, this Court should issue a writ of mandate

5 directing the State Water Board to set aside its adoption of the Bay-Delta Plan and enjoin the State

6 Water Board from taking any action to implement the Bay-Delta Plan.

7
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
8

9 Writ of Mandate - Adoption of the Bay-Delta Plan was arbitrary, capricious, and/or lacking in evidentiary support (Code of Civ. Procedure § 1085)

10 The SWB's weighing and balancing of competing beneficial uses was arbitrary, capricious,

11 and/or entirely lacking in evidentiary support because it was based upon models and analysis that ignored and/or artificially minimized negative impacts of the Tributary UIF Objective

12 263. Petitioners reallege and incorporate herein, as if set forth in full, each and every
13 preceding allegation, inclusive, of this Petition/Complaint.

14 264. The SWB relied on the SED to assess whether the Tributary UIF Objective provided
15 reasonable protection to the identified beneficial uses in the Bay-Delta Plan considering all other
16 demands being made on the waters involved, and the total values involved, beneficial and
17 detrimental, economic and social, tangible and intangible. (Wat. Code, § 13000.)

18 265. In adopting the Tributary UIF Objective, the SWB relied on the SED to estimate the
19 impacts on all the factors required to be considered by Water Code section 13241.

20 266. The SED misstates the impact of the Tributary UIF Objective on municipal supply

21 by assuming, among other things, that reductions in surface water supply caused by implementation
22 of the Tributary UIF Objective would be negated by replacing lost surface water with water from
23 other sources, such as groundwater, without accounting for the costs, feasibility, or legality of such
24 replacement.

25 267. The SED misstates the impact of the Tributary UIF Objective on municipal and
26 agricultural water supply by relying on the unsupported assumption "that municipal deliveries
27 would not be cut in times of surface water shortage." The SED provides no basis for this

28

56
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

assumption, and no analysis of reasonably foreseeable impacts if this assumption proves to be

2 inaccurate. (See e.g., SED, Appendix G-6.)

3 268. The SED misstates the impact of the Tributary UIF Objective on agricultural supply

4 by, among other things, assuming that reductions in surface water caused by implementation of the
5 Tributary UIF Objectives would be negated by replacing lost surface water with groundwater at

6 maximum pumping rates, without accounting for the costs, feasibility, or legality of such
7 replacement.

8 269. The SED misstates the impact of the Tributary UIF Objective on agricultural supply

9 by, among other things, optimizing available land and water sO that net returns to farmers are
10 maximized, by assuming that crops which use large amounts of water and generate low net revenue

11 per acre will be automatically fallowed when water is scarce, by assuming that agricultural
12 producers will act rationally and with perfect information in directing water amongst one another
13 towards the highest value crops in times of shortage, and that reductions in surface water will be
14 replaced by maximum groundwater pumping rates at 2009 capacity levels without accounting for
15 the costs, feasibility, or legality of such replacement.

16 270. The SED misstates the impact of the Tributary UIF Objective on water storage by,
17 among other things, assuming that storage in reservoirs will be maintained at certain levels

18 irrespective of the amount of water that would otherwise be required by the Tributary UIF
19 Objectives.

20 271. The SED misstates the impact of the Tributary UIF Objective on hydropower by
21 assuming that storage in reservoirs will be maintained at certain levels irrespective of the amount of
22 water that would otherwise be required by the Tributary UIF Objectives.

23 272. The SED did not provide sufficient information for the State Water Board to perform
24 a cost-benefit assessment across resource topics, such as comparing the potential costs to
25 agricultural production of the objectives against the potential benefits to fish and wildlife resources.

26 273. The State Water Board's determination that the Tributary UIF Objective provided
27 reasonable protection to the identified beneficial uses in the Bay-Delta, considering all other
28 demands being made on the waters involved, and all other factors required by Water Code section

57
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

13000, was arbitrary, capricious, and entirely lacking in evidentiary support because the SED

2 misstated the impacts on, among other things, municipal supply, agricultural supply, water storage,

3 and hydropower.

4 274. The State Water Board's determination that the Tributary UIF Objectives were

5 reasonable considering all the factors set forth in Water Code section 13241 was arbitrary,

6 capricious, and entirely lacking in evidentiary support because the SED misstated the impacts on,
7 among other things, municipal supply, agricultural supply, water storage, and hydropower.

275. Because the State Water Board's decision to adopt the Tributary UIF Objectives was

9 arbitrary, capricious, and/or entirely lacking in evidentiary support, this Court should issue a writ of
10 mandate directing the State Water Board to set aside its adoption of the Bay-Delta Plan and enjoin
11 the State Water Board from taking any action to implement the Bay-Delta Plan.

12 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

13 Writ of Mandate - Adoption of the Bay-Delta Plan was arbitrary, capricious,

14 and/or lacking in evidentiary support (Code of Civ. Procedure § 1085)
The SWB did not analyze whether the Phase 1 Amendments reasonably protected
15 the identified beneficial uses as required by Water Code § 13241 because the

16 SWB used changes in temperature, floodplain inundation, and production of Chinook salmon as a proxy for the identified beneficial uses

17 276. Petitioners reallege and incorporate herein, as if set forth in full, each and every
18 preceding allegation, inclusive, of this Petition/Complaint.
19 277. The State Water Board identified the following beneficial uses to be protected by the
20 objectives in the Bay-Delta Plan: (1) Municipal and Domestic Supply [MUN]; (2) Industrial Service
21 Supply [IND]; (3) Industrial Process Supply [PRO]; (4) Agricultural Supply [AGR]; (5) Ground
22 Water Recharge [GWR]; (6) Navigation [NAV]; (7) Water Contact Recreation [REC-1]; (8) Non-
23 Contact Water Recreation [REC-2]; (9) Shellfish Harvesting [SHELL]; (10) Commercial and Sport
24 Fishing [COMM]; (11) Warm Freshwater Habitat [WARM]; (12) Cold Freshwater Habitat
25 [COLD]; (13) Migration of Aquatic Organisms [MIGR]; (14) Spawning, Reproduction and/or Early
26 Development [SPWN]; (15) Estuarine Habitat [EST]; (16) Wildlife Habitat [WILD]; and (17) Rare,
27 Threatened, or Endangered Species [RARE] (collective, the "Beneficial Uses").

28

58
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

278. The State Water Board must establish water quality objectives that ensure the
2 reasonable protection of these identified Beneficial Uses. (Wat. Code, § 13241.)

3 279. The State Water Board did not assess whether these identified Beneficial Uses would

4 be protected by the Inflow Narrative Objective, the Tributary UIF Objectives, the Vernalis Base
5 Flow Objective, and/or the Year-round Objective.

6 280. The modeling and analysis relied upon by the State Water Board in adopting the

7 Bay-Delta Plan purports to assess the impact of the Tributary UIF Objectives on water temperature
8 and floodplain inundation on the Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced rivers.

9 281. The State Water Board used the SalSim model in an attempt to estimate how the
10 Tributary UIF Objective might impact production of Central Valley fall-run Chinook salmon.

11 282. By focusing exclusively on impacts to water temperature, floodplain inundation, and
12 production of Central Valley fall-run Chinook salmon, the State Water Board failed to assess
13 whether the identified Beneficial Uses would be protected by the objectives in the Phase

14 Amendments.

15 283. The State Water Board did not provide reasoning or rationale for using changes in
16 water temperature, floodplain inundation or production of Central Valley fall-run Chinook salmon
17 as a proxy to assess whether all the identified Beneficial Uses would be protected by the objectives

18 in the Phase 1 Amendments.

19 284. The State Water Board's implicit determination in its adoption of the Bay-Delta Plan
20 that the objectives in the Phase 1 Amendments ensure the reasonable protection of the identified
21 Beneficial Uses was arbitrary, capricious, and entirely lacking in evidentiary support because the
22 Board failed to analyze the impact of those objectives on the identified Beneficial Uses.

23 285. The State Water Board's implicit determination in its adoption of the Bay-Delta Plan
24 that the objectives in the Phase 1 Amendments ensure the reasonable protection of the identified
25 Beneficial Uses was arbitrary, capricious, and entirely lacking in evidentiary support because the
26 Board failed to provide reasoning or rationale for using changes in water temperature, floodplain
27 inundation or production of Central Valley fall-run Chinook salmon as a proxy for assessing
28 whether the identified Beneficial Uses would be protected by those objectives.

59
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

286. Because the State Water Board's implicit determination that the objectives in the

2 Phase 1 Amendments ensured reasonable protection of the identified Beneficial Uses was arbitrary,

3 capricious, and/or entirely lacking in evidentiary support, this Court should issue writ of mandate
4 directing the State Water Board to set aside its adoption of the Bay-Delta Plan and enjoin the State

5 Water Board from taking any action to implement the Bay-Delta Plan.
FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

7 Writ of Mandate - Adoption of the Bay-Delta Plan was arbitrary, capricious, and/or lacking in evidentiary support (Code of Civ. Procedure § 1085)
8

9 The SWB's modeling and analysis fails to show that the Phase 1 Amendments reasonably protected the proxies that the SWB used for assessing whether the Beneficial Uses were

10 reasonably protected as required by Water Code § 13000 and 13241

11 287. Petitioners reallege and incorporate herein, as if set forth in full, each and every
12 preceding allegation, inclusive, of this Petition/Complaint.
13 288. The State Water Board used changes in water temperature, floodplain inundation and
14 production of Central Valley fall-run Chinook salmon as a proxy for assessing whether the
15 objectives in the Phase Amendments provide reasonable protection of the identified Beneficial
16 Uses.

17 289. The use of such a proxy fails to demonstrate whether the remaining identified
18 Beneficial Uses will receive reasonable protection.

19 290. Even if the use of the temperature proxy were appropriate, the modeling and analysis
20 demonstrates that the Tributary UIF Objective will not result in cooler water temperatures without

21 operational constraints that are not required by the objectives, such as minimum reservoir carryover
22 storage and flow shifting.

23 291. Even with the incorporation of carryover storage and flow shifting, the modeling
24 results relied upon by the State Water Board fail to demonstrate that the objectives will improve
25 water temperatures because the modeling in the SED uses monthly data instead of the 7-day
26 minimum running average required by the Tributary UIF Objectives, thereby obscuring the true

27 impact of the Tributary UIF Objectives on temperature conditions.

28

60
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

292. Even with the incorporation of carryover storage and flow shifting, the modeling
2 results relied upon by the State Water Board fail to demonstrate that the Tributary UIF Objectives
3 will improve water temperatures because there is no scientific basis for the State Water Board's
4 conclusion that a 10% change in the amount of time that certain water temperatures are attained is a
5 significant benefit.

6 293. Even assuming the floodplain inundation analysis is a proper proxy for assessing

7 protection of the identified Beneficial Uses, the floodplain analysis relied upon by the State Water
8 Board fails to demonstrate that the objectives will provide a benefit to floodplain habitat because,

9 among other things, the modeling and analysis in the SED (1) does not properly distinguish between
10 inundated land and habitat; (2) does not consider the quality of newly inundated areas insofar as it
11 omits factors such as depth, flow rate, timing, duration, dissolved oxygen, temperature, and
12 substrate; (3) does not integrate findings of the temperature assessment with the floodplain
13 assessment to evaluate the expected thermal suitability of inundated areas; (4) does not consider
14  other reasonable measures such as floodplain restoration to create more frequently inundated off-
15 channel habitats; and (5) does not address empirical findings which demonstrate that wetted area
16 does not always equate to usable habitat.

17 294. Even assuming the SalSim analysis is a proper proxy for assessing protection of the
18 identified Beneficial Uses, the SalSim analysis relied upon by the State Water Board fails to
19 demonstrate that the Tributary UIF Objective will improve production of Central Valley fall-run

20 Chinook salmon because, among other things, the SalSim analysis shows that a requirement of 40%

21 unimpaired flow, with additional operational constraints that are not required by the objectives, will
22 increase average annual production over baseline by 1,103 Central Valley fall-run Chinook salmon.
23 Given average annual production of Central Valley fall-run Chinook salmon from 1976 to 2014 of
24 approximately 700,000, an increase in 1,103 fish amounts to an increase of less than a quarter of

25 one percent.

26 295. The State Water Board's implicit determination that the objectives ensure the
27 reasonable protection of the identified Beneficial Uses was arbitrary, capricious, and entirely
28 lacking in evidentiary support because the modeling and analysis relied upon by the State Water

61
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Board fails to show a benefit to water temperature, floodplain habitat, and/or production of Central
2 Valley fall-run Chinook salmon, which the State Water Board used as proxies for the identified

3 Beneficial Uses.

296. Because the State Water Board's implicit determination that the objectives ensured
5 reasonable protection of the identified Beneficial Uses was arbitrary, capricious, and/or entirely
6 lacking in evidentiary support, this Court should issue a writ of mandate directing the State Water
7 Board to set aside its adoption of the Bay-Delta Plan and enjoin the State Water Board from taking
8 any action to implement the Bay-Delta Plan.

14 297. Petitioners reallege and incorporate herein, as if set forth in full, each and every
15 preceding allegation, inclusive, of this Petition/Complaint.

16 298. When setting water quality objectives, the State Water Board must consider water
17 quality conditions that could reasonably be achieved through the coordinated control of all factors
18 which affect water quality in the area. (Wat. Code, § 13241[c].)

19 299. In adopting the Phase 1 Amendments to the Bay-Delta Plan, the State Water Board

20 failed to consider water quality conditions that could reasonably be achieved through the
21 coordinated control of all factors which affect water quality in the area.

22 300. By limiting the Phase 1 Amendments to certain watersheds within the San Joaquin
23 River Valley, the State Water Board failed to consider water quality conditions that could

24 reasonably be achieved through the coordinated control of water quality across the entire
25 Sacramento-San Joaquin Bay-Delta watershed.

26 301. By limiting the Phase 1 Amendments to the Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced
27 Rivers downstream of the rim dams on each of those rivers, the State Water Board failed to consider
28 water quality conditions that could reasonably be achieved through the coordinated control of water

2 quality across the entire San Joaquin River Valley, including the San Joaquin River upstream of its

3 confluence with the Merced River, the San Joaquin River downstream of its confluence with the

4 Merced River, and the Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers upstream of the rim dams on each
of those rivers.

5 302.

6 By limiting the Phase 1 Amendments to the Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced
Rivers downstream of the rim dams on each of those rivers, the State Water Board failed to consider
7 water quality conditions that could reasonably be achieved through the coordinated control of water
8 quality across the entire Bay-Delta watershed, including the Sacramento River watershed, and the

9

10 Calaveras, Cosumnes, and Mokelumne River watersheds.

303. By ignoring the water users and resources in these areas in adopting the Phase 1
11 Amendments, the State Water Board acted unlawfully and/or made a decision that was arbitrary,
12 capricious, and/or lacking in evidentiary support insofar as it failed to satisfy its statutory obligation
13 of considering water quality conditions that could reasonably be achieved through the coordinated
14 control of all factors which affect water quality in the area.

15 304. By limiting the Phase 1 Amendments to flow-based objectives, the State Water
16 Board failed to coordinate control of factors other than flow.

17 305. Because the State Water Board acted unlawfully and/or made decision that was
18 arbitrary, capricious, and/or lacking in evidentiary support, this Court should issue a writ of
19 mandate directing the State Water Board to set aside its adoption of the Bay-Delta Plan and enjoin
20 the State Water Board from taking any action to implement the Bay-Delta Plan.

1085) 3

v The Program of Implementation is Unlawful Because it Does Not Describe the Actions Necessary to Achieve the Objectives as Required by Water Code Section 13242, but Rather Allows for Changes to the Objectives without a Properly Noticed Hearing, Without 5 Evaluation of Environmental Impacts, and Without State Water Board Consideration and Determination of What Constitutes a Reasonable Level of Protection
6
306. 7 Petitioners reallege and incorporate herein, as if set forth in full, each and every

8 preceding allegation, inclusive, of this Petition/Complaint.

307. 9 A water quality control plan must include a program of implementation necessary for

10 achieving water quality objectives. (Wat. Code, § 13050[j].)

308. 11 The program of implementation must include a description of the nature of the

12 actions which are necessary to achieve the water quality objectives, a time schedule for the actions

13 to be taken, and a description of the surveillance to be undertaken to determine compliance with

14 objectives. (Wat. Code, § 13242.)

15 309. The adopted Program of Implementation is unlawful because it does not describe the

16 actions necessary to achieve the Tributary UIF Objectives, the Vernalis Flow Objective, the Inflow

17 Narrative Objective, and/or the Year-round Objective, but rather improperly serves as a mechanism

18 for modifying the Tributary UIF Objectives.

310. 19 The Program of Implementation is unlawful because it authorizes changes to the

20 Tributary UIF Objectives without a properly noticed hearing required by Water Code section

21 13244.

311. 22 The Program of Implementation includes a set of "Adaptive Methods."

312. 23 The Adaptive Methods in the Program of Implementation allow for the percentage of

24 unimpaired flow required by the Tributary UIF Objectives from February through June to be

25 managed as a total volume of water and released on an adaptive schedule during an unspecified

26 time period where scientific information indicates that a flow pattern different from what would

27 occur by tracking the unimpaired flow percentage would better protect fish and wildlife beneficial

uses. This adjustment allows for an unlawful change to the unimpaired flow component and the
2 minimum 7-day running average component of the Tributary UIF Objectives.

3 313. The Adaptive Methods in the Program of Implementation allow for delaying the
4 release of a portion of the February through June unimpaired flow until after June to prevent

5 adverse effects to fisheries. This adjustment unlawfully enlarges the time period applicable to the

6 Tributary UIF Objectives.

7 314. The Program of Implementation unlawfully permits the Executive Director of the

8 State Water Board to change the Tributary UIF Objectives by changing the compliance locations.

9 315. The Program of Implementation unlawfully requires the creation of reservoir
10 carryover storage minimums that are not required by, and could conflict with, the Tributary UIF

11 Objectives.

12 316. To the extent the Program of Implementation allows for changes to the objectives, it
13 is unlawful. Water quality objectives must be established for the reasonable protection of beneficial
14 uses after balancing and considering all beneficial uses of water. (Wat. Code, §§ 13000, 13241.)
15 The required mechanism for amending water quality objectives includes a properly noticed hearing,
16 evaluation of environmental and other impacts, and consideration of what constitutes a reasonable
17 level of protection in light of all relevant and statutorily required factors. (Wat. Code, § 13244.) The
18 Program of Implementation is unlawful because it establishes an alternative method for modifying
19 water quality objectives without a properly noticed and conducted hearing, without evaluation of
20 environmental and other impacts, and without approval by the State Water Board after due
21 consideration of what constitutes reasonable level of protection in light of all relevant and
22 statutorily required factors.

23 317. Because the State Water Board's action was unlawful, this Court should issue a writ
24 of mandate directing the State Water Board to set aside its adoption of the Bay-Delta Plan and

25 enjoin the State Water Board from taking any action to implement the Bay-Delta Plan.

3

4 The Program of Implementation is Unlawful Because it Requires Carryover Storage for the Purpose of Directly Protecting Beneficial Uses without a Balancing of Relevant Factors and Without Consideration of Other Beneficial Uses in Violation of Water Code Sections 13241
5 and 13242

6 318. Petitioners reallege and incorporate herein, as if set forth in full, each and every
7 preceding allegation, inclusive, of this Petition/Complaint.
8 319. The Porter-Cologne Act requires a three-step process for protecting water quality: (1)
9 identify beneficial uses of water to be protected; (2) establish objectives that provide a reasonable
10 level of protection for those beneficial uses considering all relevant factors and other beneficial
11 uses; and (3) create a program of implementation that describes the actions necessary to achieve
12 those objectives. (Wat. Code, §§ 13000, 13050[j], 13241, 13424.)
13 320. Pursuant to this mandatory three-step process, any requirements established for the
14 purpose of protecting beneficial uses must be established as objectives subject to the balancing and
15 consideration of, among other things, all beneficial uses of water. (Wat. Code, § 13000, 13241.)
16 321. The adopted Program of Implementation provides that, during the implementation
17 phase, the State Water Board will require the development and implementation of minimum
18 reservoir carryover storage targets for the purpose of protecting the beneficial uses from the
19 objectives, and preventing significant adverse temperature or other impacts on fish and wildlife or,
20 if feasible, on other beneficial uses.

21 322. As the stated purpose of the carryover storage requirements is to directly protect
22 beneficial uses of water, those requirements must be established, if at all, as objectives subject to the
23 balancing and consideration of, among other things, all beneficial uses of water. (Wat. Code, §
24 13000, 13241.) A requirement designed to directly protect beneficial uses cannot be developed as

25 part of the program of implementation, as doing SO would skip the second step in the Porter-
26 Cologne Act's mandatory process for protecting beneficial uses, and unlawfully subvert the
27 required balancing that must be performed when establishing what level of protection is reasonable.
28 By including actions in the program of implementation for the purpose of directly protecting

66
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

beneficial uses instead of for the purpose of achieving balanced objectives, the Board has violated

2 the three-step process required by the Porter-Cologne Act.

3 323. Because the State Water Board's action was unlawful, this Court should issue a writ

4 of mandate directing the State Water Board to set aside its adoption of the Bay-Delta Plan and
5 enjoin the State Water Board from taking any action to implement the Bay-Delta Plan.

6 EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION

7 Writ of Mandate - Adoption of the Bay-Delta Plan was unlawful (Code of Civ. Procedure § 1085)
8
The Program of Implementation is Unlawful Because it Fails to Comply with the 9 Requirements of Water Code § 13242

10 324. Petitioners reallege and incorporate herein, as if set forth in full, each and every
11 preceding allegation, inclusive, of this Petition/Complaint.
12 325. A program of implementation must a include a description of the actions necessary to
13 achieve the objectives. (Wat. Code, § 13242.) §
14 326. The adopted Program of Implementation is unlawful because it does not include a
15 description of the actions necessary to achieve the Inflow Narrative Objective.
16 327. The adopted Program of Implementation is unlawful because it does not include a
17 description of the actions necessary to achieve the Year-round Objective.
18 328. The adopted Program of Implementation is unlawful because it does not include a
19 description of the actions necessary to achieve the Tributary UIF Objective, and instead states that
20 implementation of the Tributary UIF Objective will require the development of information and
21 specific measures to achieve the flow objectives. The development of such measures was
22 improperly delegated to the STM Working Group or State Water Board staff. The approval of such
23 measures by the State Water Board itself was improperly deferred until after adoption of Phase
24 Amendments, instead of being completed during the Phase Amendment process.
25 329. The State Water Board has likewise failed to describe the actions necessary to
26 implement the Vernalis Flow Objective. This objective provides that at all times, the flow at
27 Vernalis shall be no lower than 1,000 cfs with an allowed adaptive management range between 800
28 1,200 cfs, inclusive. (SED, Appendix K. at 18.) When the percentage of unimpaired flow required

67
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

on the Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers is insufficient to meet the Vernalis Flow

2 Objective, additional flow from those rivers will be required. (SED, Appendix K, at 29). However,
3 the State Water Board has failed to describe the actions necessary to achieve the Vernalis Flow
4 objective because it has failed to address how diverters situated downstream of the compliance
5 points on the Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers will be managed. Instead, the State Water

6 Board vaguely asserts that it intends to "exercise its water right and water quality authority" to
7 "help ensure" that required flows from the tributaries "are used for their intended purpose" and "not

8 diverted for other purposes." (SED, Appendix K, at 28.) This sentence falls far short of the State

9 Water Board's requirement to describe actions necessary to achieve the Vernalis Flow Objective.

10 330. The adopted Program of Implementation is unlawful because it does not include a

11 description of the actions necessary to achieve the "salmon protection" objective requiring that
12 "water quality conditions shall be maintained, together with other measures in the watershed,
13 sufficient to achieve a doubling of natural production of Chinook salmon from the average
14 projection of 1967-1991, consistent with the provisions of State and federal law." (SED, Appx. K,

15 p. 17.)

16 331. The program of implementation must include a description of the surveillance to be
17 undertaken to determine compliance with the objectives. (Wat. Code, § 13242.)

18 332. The adopted Program of Implementation is unlawful it because it does not include a
19 description of the surveillance to be undertaken to determine compliance with the Inflow Narrative
20 Objective.

21 333. The adopted Program of Implementation is unlawful because it does not include a it
22 description of the surveillance to be undertaken to determine compliance with the Year-round
23 Objective.

24 334. The adopted Program of Implementation is unlawful because it does not include a
25 description of the surveillance to be undertaken to determine compliance with the Inflow Narrative

26 Objective. Specifically, it is unclear as to how regulated parties and the public will know if inflow
27 conditions from the San Joaquin River watershed to the Delta at Vernalis are sufficient to support

28

68
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

and maintain the natural production of viable native San Joaquin River watershed fish populations
2 migrating through the Delta. (SED, Appendix K, at 18.)

3 335. The adopted Program of Implementation is unlawful because it does not include a
4 description of the surveillance to be undertaken to determine compliance with the Tributary UIF
5 Objective, and instead states that implementation of the Tributary UIF Objective will require the

6 development of information and specific measures to monitor and evaluate compliance. The

7 approval of such measures by the State Water Board itself was improperly deferred until after

8 adoption of Phase 1 Amendments, instead of being completed during the Phase Amendment

9 process.

10 336. A program of implementation must include a time schedule for taking the actions

11 necessary to achieve the objectives. (Wat. Code, § 13242.)

12 337. The Program of Implementation states that the State Water Board will fully
13 implement the objectives through water right actions or water quality actions by 2022.

14 338. The proposal of a single deadline for implementation is not a sufficient time schedule
15 for actions to be taken, as there are multiple actions required for compliance. The Program of
16 Implementation fails to provide a path or schedule for creating or implementing carryover storage
17 targets, for funding and development of water conservation efforts and regional water supply
18 reliability projects, for requiring 40% unimpaired flow on the Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced

19 Rivers. The failure to include a time schedule for any of these actions is a violation of Water Code

20 section 13242.

21 339. Because the State Water Board's action was unlawful, this Court should issue a writ
22 of mandate directing the State Water Board to set aside its adoption of the Bay-Delta Plan and

23 enjoin the State Water Board from taking any action to implement the Bay-Delta Plan.

7
TENTH CAUSE OF ACTION
8
Writ of Mandate - Adoption of the Bay-Delta Plan was unlawful • (Code of Civ. Procedure 1085)

10 The Adoption of the Program of Implementation was Unlawful Because it Requires the Development of Biological Goals after the Adoption and Approval of the Phase 11 Amendments and Bay-Delta Plan

12 353. Petitioners reallege and incorporate herein, as if set forth in full, each and every
13 preceding allegation, inclusive, of this Petition/Complaint.

14 354. The Program of Implementation requires the State Water Board to seek
15 recommendations on biological goals from the STM Working Group, State Water Board staff, and
16 other interested persons. Within 180 days after the Office of Administrative Law ("OAL") approves
17 the Bay-Delta Plan, the Board will consider approval of the biological goals. Approved biological
18 goals will be used to inform the Adaptive Methods that are part of the Program of Implementation
19 in the Bay-Delta Plan.

20 355. To the extent the Adaptive Methods allow for modifications to the Tributary UIF
21 Objectives, and to the extent that the biological goals will be used to inform those modifications, the

22 creation and use of the biological goals for such purpose is unlawful and procedurally improper.

23 356. Biological goals should have been considered by the State Water Board, if at all,

24 in the process of setting water quality objectives. The post-hoc evaluation of biological goals and
25 modification of the objectives as part of the Program of Implementation is unlawful.

26 357. The Program of Implementation does not call for the establishment of the biological

27 goals until after the State Water Board adopts the Bay-Delta Plan, and after OAL approves the Bay-
28 Delta Plan. The creation of the biological goals after the adoption and approval of the Bay-Delta

71

Plan, and the use of those biological goals to inform modification and/or management of the water

2 quality objectives, is unlawful insofar as it allows for post-approval and post-adoption modification

3 of the water quality objectives and program of implementation without a properly noticed hearing,
4 and without consideration by the State Water Board as to what constitutes a reasonable level of

5 protection for beneficial uses.

6 358. Because the State Water Board's action was unlawful, this Court should issue a writ

16 TWELFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

17 Writ of Mandate - Adoption of the Bay-Delta Plan was arbitrary, capricious, and/or entirely

18 lacking in evidentiary support (Code of Civ. Procedure, § 1085)
Under the State Water Board's Analysis, the Level of Protection Afforded to Fish and 19 Wildlife Beneficial Uses by the Bay-Delta Plan is Unreasonable Given the Limited Expected

20 Protection to Fish and Wildlife Beneficial Uses and the Significant Impact on Municipal and Agricultural Water Supplies and Other Beneficial Uses

21 370. Petitioners reallege and incorporate herein, as if set forth in full, each and every
22 preceding allegation, inclusive, of this Petition/Complaint.
23 371. The State Water Board is required to set water quality objectives that provide a
24 reasonable level of protection to the identified fish and wildlife Beneficial Uses considering, among
25 other things, other beneficial uses of water.
26 372. Under the State Water Board's own analysis, the determination that the protection
27 afforded to fish and wildlife beneficial uses by the Phase 1 Amendments is reasonable given the
28 significant impacts to agricultural resources reported in the SED is arbitrary and capricious.

73
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 373. The Bay-Delta Plan's Tributary UIF Objective was established to protect fish and
2 wildlife beneficial uses. (SED, at 1-8; Appendix K, at 18.) The State Water Board asserts that its
3 Tributary UIF Objective will "improv[e] flow conditions during the February through June time

4 period so that they more closely mimic the natural hydrograph conditions to which native fish
5 species are adapted, including the relative magnitude, duration, timing, and spatial extent of flows

6 as they would naturally occur." (SED, at 19-8) (emphasis added).)

7 374. The Board's determination that the Tributary UIF Objective will protect fish and
8 wildlife beneficial uses by mimicking the natural hydrograph was arbitrary and capricious. First,

9 "unimpaired flow," as defined in the SED, does not depict the natural, unaltered flow regime of the

10 eastside tributaries or the Lower San Joaquin River. Instead, the "unimpaired flows" proposed by
11 the State Water Board are theoretical in nature. These flows have never occurred in the Lower San

12 Joaquin River or its contributing tributaries at their confluence with the Lower San Joaquin River.
13 Thus, fish species (e.g., migrating salmon and steelhead) could never have become "adapted" to

14 these flows.

15 375. The California Department of Water Resources ("DWR") has stated that unimpaired
16 flows represent poor substitutes for mimicking natural hydrographic conditions. In 2016, DWR
17 released a report titled "Estimates of Natural and Unimpaired Flows for the Central Valley of
18 California: Water years 1922 - 2014" ("DWR Flow Report"). There, DWR stated that
19 "[u]nimpaired flow estimates are theoretical in that such conditions have not occurred historically."
20 (DWR Flow Report, at ES-1.) DWR concluded that, "the findings of this report show that
21 unimpaired flow estimates are poor surrogates for natural flow conditions." (Id. (emphasis
22 added).)

23 376. Second, the Program of Implementation undermines any benefit that may be
24 provided by attempting to mimic the natural hydrograph through adherence to an unimpaired flow
25 requirement. Specifically, the Program of Implementation authorizes the State Water Board, or the
26 Executive Director of the SWB to, amongst other things, make the following "adaptive
27 adjustments" to the Tributary UIF Objective: (1) adjust the percent of unimpaired flow required; (2)
28 manage the required percent of unimpaired flow for February through June as a total volume of

74
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

water released on an adaptive schedule different from what would occur by tracking the unimpaired
2 flow (referred to by the SWB as "flow shaping"); and (3) release of a portion of the February
3 through June unimpaired flow after June to prevent adverse effects to fisheries, including
4 temperature, that would otherwise result from implementation of the February through June flow
5 requirements (referred to by the SWB as "flow shifting"). To the extent that adherence to an

6 unimpaired flow regime might crudely mimic a natural hydrograph, any expected benefits that may
7 have been derived from such a flow regime would be lost due to the myriad of changes permitted to

8 the Tributary UIF Objective.

9 377. Third, the State Water Board's contention that natural flows benefit native fish
10 species is unsupported. The record contains no evidence that an unimpaired flow objective provides
11 any benefit, let alone protection, to any specific species of fish.

12 378. The State Water Board's analysis of fish and wildlife protection also improperly

13 focuses on Central Valley fall-run Chinook salmon to the exclusion of other identified Beneficial
14 Uses in the Bay-Delta Plan.

15 379. The water temperature analysis, floodplain habitat analysis, and salmonid production
16 analysis in the SED fail to demonstrate that the Phase 1 Amendments provide any significant

17 benefit to the identified Beneficial Uses.

18 380. By contrast, implementation of the Phase 1 Amendments would have devastating
19 consequences for water supply (both agricultural and municipal), environment, and economy and,

20 as the SED recognizes, would result in significant impacts to agricultural water supply.

21 381. The State Water Board did not make findings regarding the balancing of competing
22 beneficial uses. However, the Board's adoption of the Phase 1 Amendments suggest the Board's
23 implicit conclusion that the benefits to fish and wildlife are reasonable despite the adverse impacts
24 on agricultural water supply. Because the Board's implicit determination that the water quality
25 objectives provide a reasonable level of protection to identified fish and wildlife Beneficial Uses
26 and in light of the impact of those objectives on other beneficial uses such as municipal and
27 agricultural water supplies not being supported by the analysis in the SED, the Board's decision was
28 arbitrary, capricious, and lacking in evidentiary support.

75
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- 382.

2 Because the State Water Board's decision was arbitrary, capricious, and entirely
lacking in evidentiary support, this Court should issue a writ of mandate directing the State Water
3 Board to set aside its adoption of the Bay-Delta Plan and enjoin the State Water Board from taking
4 any action to implement the Bay-Delta Plan.

7 Writ of Mandate Adoption of the Bay-Delta Plan was arbitrary, capricious, and/or lacking in evidentiary support (Code of Civ. Procedure § 1085)

8 The evidence in the record establishes the Phase 1 Amendments do not provide a reasonable

9 level of protection to the identified Beneficial Uses as required by Water Code § 13241

383. Petitioners reallege and incorporate herein, as if set forth in full, each and every
10 preceding allegation, inclusive, of this Petition/Complaint.

11 384. The State Water Board's implicit determination that the Phase Amendments ensure
12 reasonable protection of the identified Beneficial Uses was arbitrary, capricious, and entirely
13 lacking in evidentiary support because such a determination was contradicted by the analysis
14 presented by the SJTA, its member agencies, and public commenters.

15 385. The analysis presented by the SJTA, its member agencies, and other commenters
16 demonstrated, among other things, that the implementation of the Phase 1 Amendments severely
17 depleted reservoir storage levels, provided no benefit to instream water temperatures, resulted in a

18 decrease in salmonid production numbers, and provided no protection to fall-run Chinook salmon in
19 the month of June. The State Water Board ignored, or failed to properly consider, these analyses in
20 concluding that the Phase 1 Amendments provided a reasonable level of protection to fish and

21 wildlife Beneficial Uses.

22 386. Because the State Water Board's implicit determination that the Phase
23 Amendments ensured reasonable protection of the identified fish and wildlife Beneficial Uses was
24 arbitrary, capricious, and/or entirely lacking in evidentiary support, this Court should issue a writ of
25 mandate directing the State Water Board to set aside its adoption of the Bay-Delta Plan, and enjoin
26 the State Water Board from taking any action to implement the Bay-Delta Plan.

1 FOURTEENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 Writ of Mandate Adoption of the Bay-Delta Plan was arbitrary, capricious, and/or lacking in evidentiary support (Code of Civ. Procedure § 1085)
3
The SED fails to consider the economic impacts of implementation of the Phase
4 Amendments (Water Code, § 13241)

5 387. Water Code section 13241(d) requires the State Water Board to "consider the cost of
6 compliance" when establishing water quality objectives (City of Burbank v. State Water Resources
7 Control Bd. (Cal. 2005) 35 Cal. 4th 613, 625), and imposes "obligations that can be enforced by a

8 writ of mandate." (City of Arcadia v. State Water Resources Control Bd. (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th

9 156, 176, as modified on denial of reh'g (Jan. 20, 2011).) The economic analysis in the SED lacks
10 the necessary evidentiary support to demonstrate that the objectives are reasonable in light of their
11 economic impact, and otherwise fails to show that there is a "rational connection" between the
12 objectives chosen and the economic cost of attaining the benefits anticipated to be achieved by the

13 objectives. (Racanelli, supra, 182 Cal.App.3d at 113.)

14 388. The economic analysis in the SED fails to evaluate the economic impact of
15 implementing the objectives, and instead unlawfully defers that analysis to subsequent project-level
16 proceedings. (Wat. Code, § 13050[i], 13241[d].)

17 389. The economic analysis in the SED fails to compare the costs of the newly adopted
18 objectives to the anticipated benefits of those objectives, as is required under the Water Code when
19 setting objectives to provide a reasonable level of protection to beneficial uses considering the
20 economic impact of the objectives, as well as the other demands and beneficial uses of the water.

21 (Wat. Code, §1300, 13241.)

22 390. The economic analysis in the SED also understates the impact of the objectives on
23 the agricultural economy by unreasonably assuming across all farms that high-water use crops
24 generating low net revenue per acre will be fallowed when water is more scarce, that farmers will
25 act rationally and with perfect information in directing water towards the highest value crops in
26 times of shortage, and that surface water reductions will be offset by maximum groundwater
27 pumping rates at 2009 capacity levels without any analysis as to whether pumping at this rate would
28  be sustainable or lawful under the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act.

77
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

391. The SED fails to consider, in violation of Water Code section 13241(d), that the
2 Board's implementation of the Phase 1 Amendments could increase existing water shortages in the

3 RWS Service Area during sequential-year droughts, and consequently result in severe economic
4 impacts to San Francisco and its retail and wholesale customers in the Bay Area, including a

5 significant loss of jobs and economic output throughout the region.

6 392. The SED avoids analyzing the predictable, adverse impacts to the Bay Area by

7 assuming San Francisco will be able to completely replace the 116 mgd annual reduction in RWS

8 water supplies during protracted droughts with the development of alternative sources, i.e., by

9 purchasing the requisite volume of replacement water from the Districts, constructing a large-scale
10 desalination plant in the Delta, and/or developing an in-Delta diversion project.

11 393. The SED fails to analyze the economic impacts associated with each of these
12 proposed water supply alternatives. The SED's deficiencies include:

13 a. Reliance on an assumed purchase price for water in support of its envisioned

14 transfer of an unprecedented volume of water from the Districts to San

15 Francisco during a sequential-year drought;

16 b. Failure to analyze the economic impacts of the 56,000 acre-feet per year

17 desalination plant at Mallard Slough envisioned in the Phase 1 Amendments;

18 C. Failure to analyze the in-Delta diversion project proposed by the Board; and,

19 d. Failure to consider that the Phase 1 Amendments would substantially

20 decrease San Francisco's hydropower generation and result in a consequent

21 loss in associated revenue.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- 395. The State Water Board's adoption of the SED constitutes a prejudicial abuse of
2 discretion in that the State Water Board failed to proceed in a manner required by law.

3 396. The Board failed to proceed in a manner required by law because the SED fails to
4 provide a proper description of the adopted project, as follows (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 23, §
5 3777[b][1]):

6 a. The SWB's project description failed to disclose fundamental portions of the
7 project that were included in the program of implementation, including, among other things,

8 minimum reservoir storage levels, flow shifting, flow shaping, and reservoir refill criteria.
9 b. The SED failed to present a clear description of the project because it fails to
10 clarify the extent to which municipalities, including San Francisco, are responsible for complying
11 with the LSJR Flow Objectives. The SED contains vague, conflicting statements regarding how
12 the Tributary UIF Objective will apply to municipalities generally and San Francisco specifically.

13 C. The SWB failed to identify or provide a consistent project horizon.

14 d. The SWB failed to identify a preferred alternative.

15 e. The SED's incomplete, inconsistent, and internally contradictory statements
16 regarding the project description violate the substantive standards of CEQA, and the requirements
17 associated with the State Water Board's certified regulatory program.

18 397. The SWB unlawfully segmented the environmental review of the Bay-Delta Plan
19 update into two phases and two separate programmatic environmental documents.

20 a. The SWB's water quality control planning program is a certified regulatory

21 program that is exempt from the CEQA requirements of preparing an EIR and/or a negative
22 declaration, but the Board must prepare SED in lieu of an EIR. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21080.5;
23 Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15251).

24 b. CEQA requires that the cumulative impact of proposed project be analyzed
25 when determining whether the project will have a significant effect on the environment. (Pub.
26 Resources Code, § 21083[b][2].)

3 project.

4 d. The combined Phase 1 and Phase 2 revisions to the Bay-Delta Plan, along

5 with the Phase : process proposed for implementing the revisions from Phases and 2, must be

6 analyzed together to determine whether the project, as a whole, will have significant environmental

7 impacts; the SWB failed to conduct this analysis.

e. The Inflow Narrative Objective requires that inflow from the San Joaquin

9 River into the Delta be maintained SO as to support and maintain the natural production of viable
10 native San Joaquin River watershed fish populations migrating through the Delta. However, the

11 analysis in the SED is confined to a certain section of the San Joaquin River watershed and does

12 not extend through the Delta. The analysis fails to address whether any flows from the San Joaquin
13 River watershed which reach the Delta contribute to Delta outflow in a way that would assist in a
14 migration through the Delta.

15 f. In addition, the Framework Document issued by the Board explaining the
16 2 interrelation of Phase 1 and Phase 2 demonstrates that certain objectives being developed during
17 Phase 2 (such as the inflow-based Delta outflow objective) are dependent upon the objectives that
18 were developed during Phase 1. Specifically, the Framework Document states that the inflow-
19 based Delta Outflow objective will prescribe that "[t]he inflows required above, including from the
20 Sacramento/Delta tributaries and San Joaquin River are required as outflows with adjustments for

21 downstream natural depletions and accretions."

22 g. There is no analysis in the SED for Phase 1 that incorporates or otherwise
23 considers the changes to the Bay-Delta Plan being contemplated as part of Phase 2.

24 h. By dividing the revisions to the Bay-Delta Plan into two phases (Phase 1 for
25 the San Joaquin River watershed and Phase 2 for the Sacramento River watershed and Delta), and
26 by segmenting the environmental review of its actions into two (or potentially more) programmatic
27 documents, the SWB has ignored the interconnected nature of the entire Bay-Delta estuary,
28 eliminated reasonable alternatives that should be weighed against one another, excluded from

1 consideration certain mitigation measures, skewed the balance of the proposed project's benefits
2 against its costs, and otherwise distorted the impact of the project, thereby proceeding in an
3 unlawful manner and abusing its discretion.

4 398. The Board is required to consider the impacts of the project against a baseline of
5 existing conditions. The Board failed to proceed in manner required by law because the SED does

6 not compare the project to a baseline of existing conditions, and instead employs an incorrect and

7 unrealistic baseline.

8 a. The SED uses a baseline flow regime on the San Joaquin River (as measured

9 at Vernalis) that includes the Vernalis Adaptive Management Program (VAMP). VAMP expired in
10 2011 in accordance with Water Rights Decision 1641. The inclusion of VAMP in the baseline
11 misrepresents (1) the existing responsibility for meeting flow requirements at Vernalis on the San
12 Joaquin River, and (2) the existing amount of flow required at Vernalis on the San Joaquin River.

13 b. The SED uses a baseline that does not include flows being released as part
14 of the San Joaquin River Restoration Program (SJRRP). The failure to include SJRRP flows in the
15 baseline misrepresents existing conditions in which those flows are present.

16 399. The Board failed to proceed in a manner required by law because the SED does not
17 analyze cumulative impacts. (See generally Cal. Code Regs., tit. 23 §§ 3777[b][2], 15130, 15355.)

18 a. The SED fails to analyze the cumulative impacts of the project on
19 groundwater resources.

20 b. The SED fails to evaluate how the project will affect compliance with the
21 Sustainable Groundwater Management Act ("SGMA").

22 C. The SED fails to analyze the cumulative impacts of the Phase 1
23 Amendments with the related impacts from the Phase 2 Amendments of the State Water Board's
24 update to the Bay-Delta Plan.

25 d. The SED fails to analyze the cumulative impacts of the project with impacts
26 that would be caused by an approval of the California Waterfix change petition.

27 e. The SED fails to analyze the cumulative impacts of the project with impacts
28 that would be caused by reasonably foreseeable water transfers between irrigation districts.

81
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

400. The SWB failed to proceed in a manner required by law in evaluating the project's

2 significant or potentially significant impacts because the thresholds of significance in the SED are
3 improper and uninformative. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 23, § 3777[b][2].)

4 a. The SED analyzes the project's impact on agriculture by evaluating the

5 amount of farmland that would be converted to non-agricultural use, but the analysis is limited to

6 farmland that is already designated as prime, unique, or of statewide importance (AG1). By
7 excluding farmland that does not meet these designations, the SED excludes approximately 17% of
8 the plan area's total farming acreage and thereby significantly underestimates the impact of the

9 project.

10 b. In analyzing the project's impact on agriculture, the SED fails to evaluate
11 the impact of the project on cattle and dairy sectors, and thereby significantly underestimates the
12 impact of the project.

13 401. The SWB failed to proceed in a manner required by law because the SED fails to
14 evaluate the significant or potentially significant impacts of the project on the following resources
15 (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 23, § 3777[b][2]):

16 a. Water supply, insofar as the WSE model does not accurately depict the
17 project without the inclusion of mitigation measures such as carryover storage, reservoir refill
18 criteria, flow shaping, flow shifting, and maximum groundwater pumping;

19 b. Water supply, insofar as the SED does not analyze impacts during dry and
20 successive dry years;

21 C. Water supply, insofar as the analysis fails to analyze how the Tributary UIF
22 Objective interacts with the Inflow Narrative Objective, the Vernalis Base Flow Objective, and the
23 Year-round Objective;

24 d. Water supply, insofar as the analysis fails evaluate the changes to the
25 October flow requirements;

26 e. Water supply, insofar as the analysis fails to evaluate the impact on
27 municipal supplies;

28

82
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 f. Agricultural resources, insofar as the State Water Board's SWAP model
2 does not model the project's effects on:

3 i. Air quality;

4 ii. Energy;

5 iii. Groundwater;

6 iv. Recreation;

7 V. Cultural resources; and

8 vi. Climate Change

9 402. The Board failed to proceed in a manner required by law because the SED fails to

10 evaluate the significant or potentially significant impacts occurring outside the specified plan area.

11 (Cal. Code Regs., tit. § 23, § 3777[b][2].)

12 a. The SED assumes that the impacts within the plan area will be the same as
13 those outside the plan area but fails to provide any explanation or analysis to support this
14 assumption.

15 403. The Board failed to proceed in a manner required by law because the SED does not
16 describe or analyze reasonable alternatives to the project and mitigation measures to avoid or reduce
17 any significant or potentially significant adverse impacts. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 23, § 3777[b][3].)

18 a. Mitigation measures such as minimum reservoir Carryover Storage,
19 reservoir refill requirements, flow shaping, flow shifting, maximum groundwater pumping, and
20 prioritization of municipal supply, among others, were incorporated into the SED analysis without

21 being identified as mitigation measures, leaving no grounds for comparison of the project
22 impacts with and without these mitigation measures.

23 b. The SED did not consider reasonable alternatives to the project that were not
24 premised upon unimpaired flow percentages from February through June, including, but not
25 limited to, functional flows instead of unimpaired flow percentages, flow requirements from
26 February through May instead of February through June, and/or addressing stressors such as ocean
27 harvest numbers, hatchery practices, predation, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, nutrient
28 depletion, toxics, turbidity, availability of food, and adverse impacts to habitat.

83
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

404. The Board failed to proceed in a manner required by law because the SED does not
2 consider reasonably foreseeable methods of compliance. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 23, § 3777[b][(4].)

3 a. The SED only considers a single and very specific method of compliance,

4 which is set forth in the modeling assumptions and parameters and which includes, among other
5 things, minimum reservoir Carryover Storage requirements that are not required by the objectives,

6 reservoir refill criteria that are not required by the objectives, flow shifting that is not required by -

7 and conflicts with - the objectives, and maximum groundwater pumping. Other reasonable

8 methods of compliance exist and the SWB was required to consider those methods.

9 b. The only method of compliance analyzed in the SED, which is set forth in

10 the modeling assumptions and parameters, is not reasonable because it includes, among other
11 things, numerous modeling assumptions which are not required by the objectives.

12 405. The Board failed to proceed in a manner required by law because the SED failed to
13 analyze the impacts of San Francisco's most reasonably foreseeable method of compliance with the
14 Plan Amendment.

15 a. The SED fails to analyze the environmental and economic impacts of San
16 Francisco's most reasonably foreseeable method of compliance with the Plan Amendment:
17 reduction of water deliveries throughout the RWS Service Area.

18 b. San Francisco and other parties brought this failure to the Board's attention
19 several times, but the SED failed to address the comments.

20 C. In violation of both the requirements of the certified regulatory program

21 associated with the State Water Board's water quality control program and CEQA, the SED fails to
22 consider that increased rationing throughout the RWS Service Area, and the consequent reduction
23 in outdoor water use and resulting loss in park vegetation, landscaping and trees (the urban forest),
24 would result in significant environmental impacts, including, but not limited to:

25 i. adverse impacts to cultural, aesthetic and recreational resources;

26 ii. increased risk of urban wildfires;

27 iii. adverse impacts to habitat; and

28

84
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

iv. effects on energy consumption, human health, water quality, air

2 quality, and greenhouse gas emissions from the exacerbation of urban

3 heat islands.

4 d. The SED also fails to analyze the environmental impacts that significantly
increased water rationing within the RWS Service Area would cause by restricting urban growth

6 and increasing sprawl, including, but not limited to, the following:

i. increased emissions of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants;

8 ii. loss of open space, forests, habitat, and agriculture; and water-related
9 impacts of bringing sprawling development into affected areas.

10 e. The SED also fails to disclose or consider that the Plan Amendment
11 contradicts Plan Bay Area and other state and regional plans designed to promote green
12 infrastructure and avoid adverse environmental impacts.

13 f. By failing to acknowledge that San Francisco would need to increase
14 rationing throughout the RWS Service Area if the State Water Board implemented the Plan
15 Amendment, the SED fails to consider severe economic impacts to San Francisco and its retail and
16 wholesale customers in the Bay Area, including a significant loss of jobs and economic output, that
17 increased rationing would cause.

18 406. The SED failed to evaluate reasonably foreseeable methods of compliance that
19 would have less significant adverse environmental impacts. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 23, §
20 3777[b][4][C].)

21 a. The SED only analyzes one method of complying with the 40% unimpaired
22 flow requirement.

23 b. The State Water Board acknowledged that the modeling shows how
24 compliance with the water quality objectives could occur, but is not prescribing how it must occur.

25 C. The State Water Board acknowledged that compliance could clearly happen
26 in other ways that would take less water, but the SED does not analyze those other ways.

27

28

85
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 407. The Board failed a to proceed in a manner required by law because the SED does not
2 describe the specific reasons for rejecting mitigation measures or project alternatives that have been
3 deemed infeasible. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 23, § 3777[d]; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15091[c].)

4 408. The SWB failed to proceed in a manner required by law because it failed to adopt a

5 sufficient statement of overriding considerations with the requisite balancing of economic, legal,
6 social, technological, or other benefits. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 23 § 3777[d]; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14,
7§ 15093.)

8 409. The SWB failed to proceed in a manner required by law because the No-Project

9 Alternative is unlawful.

10 a. The No-Project Alternative in the SED includes operational requirements

11 which would not exist if the State Water Board took no action, such as that OID and SSJID would
12 share the responsibility with USBR of complying with D-1641.

13 b. The No-Project Alternative in the SED fails to accurately depict that USBR
14  has not met the terms and conditions of its permits, as specified in D-1641, requiring certain flows

15 at Vernalis, and has stated it will not operate to meet these requirements. The No-Project
16 Alternative fails to acknowledge that numerous temporary urgency change orders have been issued

17 by the State Water Board relaxing the terms and conditions of USBR's permits requiring certain
18 flows at Vernalis, as specified in D-1641.

19 410. The State Water Board failed to provide detailed, good-faith, and reasoned analysis
20 in response to the numerous public comments that were submitted in violation of CEQA. (Pub.
21 Resources Code § 21091(d)(1); Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15088; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 23, §
22 3779(d).)

23 411. The State Water Board's conclusory responses to comments provided by other
24 agencies, including by the STJA member agencies, which directly critiqued the adequacy of the
25 data and methodology used by the State Water Board, rendered the SED legally deficient, and its
26 adoption thereof an abuse of discretion.

27 412. The Board failed to provide a good-faith, reasoned analysis in response to comments
28 on the SED. Notwithstanding the comments received in response to the Draft SED, the final SED:

86
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- a.

2 Fails to explain why the Tributary UIF Objectives only pertain to February -
June, despite the Board's SalSim model showing the greatest increase in the

3 number of fish when a significant portion of the February - June water is

4 shifted to fall (September • December);

5 b. Fails to acknowledge that the results from SalSim undercut the Board's

6 premise that more flow equals more fish;

7 C. Ignores the fact that the Tributary UIF Objectives will eliminate the ability

8 to store water and operate reservoirs as they were designed to operate;
9 d.

10 Fails to fully acknowledge that the operations depicted in its modeling (e.g.,

11 carryover storage, flow shifting etc.) rely on a level of foresight that does not
exist in real world reservoir operations;

12 e. Fails to analyze impacts to the Bay Area from increased water supply

13 rationing;

14 f. Fails to use San Francisco's eight-and-a-half year design drought in its

15 modeling of water supply impacts;

16 g. Fails to use the SFPUC's more precise hydrological modeling results of

17 impacts to the RWS;

19 socioeconomic impacts from increased rationing;

20 i. Erroneously relies on the SFPUC's long-term planning documents to

21 establish the alleged availability of alternative water supplies in the near

22 term;

23 j. Fails to support the three methods of compliance for San Francisco it

24 identifies;

25 k. Fails to support its assumption that implementation of the Plan Amendment

26 would result in minimal effects to economic growth and housing starts in the

27 Bay Area; and

1 Fails to substantively respond to the SFPUC Alternative. (See Cal. Code

2 Regs., tit. 14, § 15088(c) ("[c]onclusory statements unsupported by factual

3 information will not suffice.").)

413. The Board failed to proceed in a manner required by law because the Notices of
5 Preparation (NOP) distributed in 2009 and 2011 did not adequately describe the project adopted by
6 the Board.

7 a. The 2009 NOP described the project as a review and update of the flow

8 objectives on the San Joaquin River; it did not state that the Board would consider new numeric

9 flow objectives on the Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and/or Merced Rivers.

10 b. The 2011 NOP described the proposed project as a review of, and potential

11 amendments to, the San Joaquin River flow objectives for the protection of fish and wildlife
12 beneficial uses, as well as the creation of a new narrative objective at the confluence of each of the
13 Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers; it did not it provide notice of a project that would create
14 new numeric flow objectives on the Stanislaus, Tuolumne, or Merced Rivers.

15 C. The SWB did not update or further revise the 2011 NOP in relation to the
16 Phase 1 Amendments.

17 d. The Phase 1 Amendments contained new numeric flow objectives on the
18 Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers, minimum reservoir carryover storage targets, and
19 reservoir refill requirements, among other things not specified in the 2009 NOP and 2011 NOP.

20 414. The SWB failed to proceed in a manner required by law because the Board did not
21 identify and consult with local agencies as responsible agencies. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21069.)

SIXTEENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 Violations of California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code § 21000, et seq.)
3

4 The State Water Board's Decision to Adopt the SED Is Not Supported by Substantial Evidence

415. Petitioners12 reallege and incorporate herein, as if set forth in full, each and every

6 preceding allegation, inclusive, of this Petition/Complaint.

7 416. The State Water Board's decision to adopt the SED, and the findings therein, was not

8 supported by substantial evidence because the models relied upon by the SWB in the SED do not

9 accurately depict the project.

10 a. In the SED, the effects of the project on reservoir operations, flood control
11 releases, water supply diversions, and water quality in the SJR at Vernalis and in the southern

12 Delta were analyzed using the SWB's Water Supply Effects ("WSE") model.

13 b. The WSE model assumes flows that are based on a static monthly average
14 rather than the minimum 7-day running average that is required by the Phase 1 Amendments.

15 C. The WSE model assumes reservoir carryover storage requirements that are
16 not required by the objectives, nor enforceable by the Board.

17 d. The WSE model assumes reservoir drawdown and refill criteria that are not

18 required by the objectives.

19 e. The WSE model assumes that a percentage of total unimpaired flow from
20 February through June will be shifted to other times of the year in a way that is not required by the

21 objectives.

22 f. As the assumptions in the WSE model are not required by the objectives, the
23 SWB's decision to adopt the SED and the project was not supported by substantial evidence
24 because it was based on WSE modeling results that did not reflect the project.

25 g. In the SED, the effects of the project on agriculture were analyzed using the
26 SWB's Statewide Agricultural Production ("SWAP") model.

27

28

12 MID is not participating as member of the SJTA in this cause of action.
89
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

h. The SWAP model incorporates the results and modeling from the WSE

2 model.

3 i. The SWAP model assumes that agricultural decisions will be market based,
4 but it fails to include all reasonably foreseeable market factors. The SWAP model relies only on
5 commodity pricing to form assumptions as to which crops will be fallowed, but it fails to consider
6 the secondary value that crops such as alfalfa and pasture have on the cattle and dairy sectors.

7 j. The SWAP model assumes that all lower value crops will be fallowed before

8 higher value crops through intra-district water transfers. However, individual farmers rarely hold

9 water rights separate and apart from irrigation districts. Certain irrigation districts do not allow
10 intra-district water transfers. The SWAP model did not evaluate which irrigation districts permit

11 such transfers and which preclude such transfers. The SWAP model did not assess how the
12 agricultural community would be impacted given the restrictions on intra-district water transfers.

13 k. The SWAP model does not disclose the commodity pricing and yield
14 production numbers relied upon. Without such information, the SWB could not assess whether the
15 model correctly valued crops, whether it properly determined which crops would be fallowed, or
16 whether it properly assessed the number of acres fallowed.

17 1. The SWAP model obscures the analysis of significant or potentially
18 significant environmental impacts, and artificially inflates the benefits of the project by improperly
19 assessing the impact on agriculture.

20 m. As the assumptions in the SWAP model are inaccurate and do not reflect
21 feasible or foreseeable responses to the proposed project, the SWB's decision to adopt the SED and
22 the project was not supported by substantial evidence because it was based, in part, on the
23 analytical results from the SWAP model.

24 n. In addition, the SalSim model includes assumptions that are not required by
25 the objectives, or otherwise supported, and the SWB's decision to approve the SED and the project
26 was not supported by substantial evidence because it was based, in part, on estimates from the

27 SalSim model.

28

90
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

0. Because the SWB's decision to adopt the SED was not supported by
2 substantial evidence, the Board's action was an abuse of discretion and its decision must be set

3 aside. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21168.5, § 21168.9.)

417. The Board's decision to adopt the SED, and the findings therein, is not supported by
5 substantial evidence because it is not reasonably foreseeable that San Francisco would be able to (1)
6 effectuate a large-scale water transfer with the Districts, or any other potential seller in the Central
7 Valley, during a protracted drought; (2) develop a large-scale desalination plant located at Mallard
8 Slough; or (3) develop the proposed in-Delta diversion project. The Board's analysis of these

9 compliance methods is not supported by substantial evidence.

10 a. First, the claim that the Districts, or any other entity, would willingly transfer

11 an extraordinary volume of water to San Francisco in the midst of a protracted drought--and
12 following implementation of the Plan Amendment, which will exacerbate dry year water supply
13 reductions-is pure unsupported speculation.

14 b. Second, the SED entirely failed to assess the feasibility, costs, and
15 environmental impacts of a large-scale desalination plant in the Delta.

16 C. Third, the State Water Board's analysis of the contemplated in-Delta
17 diversion project unreasonably cites San Francisco's prior determination that the same project was
18 infeasible, and then, without offering additional analysis, facts, or explanation, asserts the project
19 should now be considered feasible.

20 d. The SED also fails to provide an adequate analysis of the economic impacts

21 of these three proposed alternative water supply sources. The SED fails to provide evidentiary
22 support for its assumptions about the probable price of water available for a large-scale water
23 transfer, and entirely fails to analyze the economic impacts of a large-scale desalination plant
24 located at Mallard Slough, or the proposed in-Delta diversion project. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 23, §
25 3777(c); Pub. Res. Code § 21159(c); Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15187(d).)

26 418. The State Water Board's decision to adopt the SED, and the findings therein, was not
27 supported by substantial evidence because the Board failed to properly analyze whether the
28 thresholds of significance were met or exceeded.

91
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

a. The SED fails to explain how the Board determined that agricultural land

2 would be converted to non-agricultural uses, and instead generally asserted that a reduction in
3 water supply was used as a proxy for the conversion of irrigated land to nonagricultural land.

4 b. The analysis in the SED fails to evaluate the water demand for land that has
5 been converted from agricultural to nonagricultural use and presumes that the land converted to
6 nonagricultural use will have no water demand.

7 C. The SWB's determination that the project will not cause seepage issues that
8 result in significant conversion of farmland to nonagricultural use (AG2) is conclusory and not

9 supported by substantial evidence.

10 d. The SWB determined the project will not cause significant impacts to cattle

11 and dairy farming sectors due to fallowing of pasture and alfalfa (AG2) because, among other
12 things, the cattle/dairy sector can import feed. The determination is conclusory and not supported
13 by substantial evidence.

14 e. The SWB determined the project would not conflict with Williamson Act
15 contracts which restrict enrolled parcels of land to agricultural or related open space use. This
16 determination is conclusory and not supported by substantial evidence because, among other

17 things, the SWB failed to identify the baseline quantity of acreage that is under Williamson Act

18 contract.

19 f. The SWB determined that the project would not conflict with existing land
20 use plans or policies (AG4). This determination is conclusory and not supported by substantial
21 evidence because, among other things, the SED failed to identify any land use plans or policies
22 related to agriculture.

23 419. The State Water Board's adoption of the SED, and the findings therein, was not
24 supported by substantial evidence because the Board improperly used the project's impacts on fall-

25 run Chinook salmon as a proxy for the project's impacts on all fish and wildlife beneficial uses.

26 a. The SED does not analyze how the project will affect each of the fish
27 species identified as protected by the Phase 1 Amendments.

28

92
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

b. The SED explains that the fall-run Chinook salmon were used as a proxy

2 due to their sensitivity to expected changes in environmental conditions in the plan area and their
3 utility in evaluating broader ecosystem and community-level responses to environmental change.

4 This explanation is not supported by any citation or scientific information demonstrating the
5 propriety of selecting this species for the purpose of determining the impacts of the project.

6 C. The SED focused almost entirely on the impacts to Central Valley Fall-run
7 Chinook salmon. The adoption of the SED was not supported by substantial evidence because it
8 was based, in part, on the analysis of a single species and the unsupported assumption this species

9 could be used as a proxy for all other fish and wildlife beneficial uses.

10 d. Because the adoption of the SED was not supported by substantial evidence,
11 the Board's action was an abuse of discretion and its decision must be set aside. (Pub. Resources

12 Code, § 21168.5, § 21168.9.)

13 420. The SWB's decision to adopt the SED, and findings therein, was not supported by
14 substantial evidence due to inadequacies in the floodplain inundation analysis.

15 a. For the Stanislaus River, the SED relies on the USFWS model estimate
16| inundation of floodplain areas by reach of river. The SED makes the general assumption, based on
17 this model, that floodplain inundation on the Stanislaus River begins when flows are at 1,000 cubic
18 feet per second. However, the USFWS model applies an inundation threshold ranging between
19 1,000 and 1,500 cfs depending on the river reach. By setting the floodplain inundation threshold at
20 the lowest point (1,000 cfs) the SED estimates there are 43 instances of inundation improvements

21 of 10% or greater. If the inundation threshold is set at the more common threshold in the USFWS

22 model, there are only 19 instances of inundation.

23 b. For the Tuolumne River, the SED relies on floodplain modeling developed
24 by USFWS in the FERC process. This model looks at only a specific reach of the river, from mile
25 52 to mile 21.5. The SED analysis omits the lower 20 miles of the river, where floodplain
26 thresholds are often higher and may reduce the amount of improved floodplain habitat per river

27 mile.

28

93
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

C. For the Merced River, no floodplain model or relationship has been
2 developed. The SED estimates floodplain inundation by calculating water surface area and
3 comparing the estimated surface area with flows. The SED omits an analysis of the lower 27 mile

4 stretch of the river and the actual floodplain inundation that will result from the project is not clear

5 and cannot be determined from the information disclosed in the SED.

d. The floodplain analysis incorrectly assumes all out-of-bank flows are usable
7 floodplain habitat. The SED does not assess whether floodplain inundation in particular areas will

8 result in usable habitat. Specifically, the SED does not evaluate duration, depth, velocity, cover,

9 connectivity, and water temperature, all of which are necessary to determine if inundated

10 floodplain will make suitable habitat. Instead, the SED relies on the unsupported assumption that
11 wetted acre days equals floodplain habitat, which vastly over-estimates the amount of floodplain

12 habitat that will result from the Phase 1 Amendments.

13 e. The SED evaluates floodplain improvement based upon a 30-day average,
14 which is inconsistent with the Tributary UIF Objective requiring the maintenance of 40%
15 unimpaired flow based upon a minimum 7-day running average.

16 f. The SED also determines that a 10% increase in floodplain inundation will
17 have a significant benefit. However, it also states that the 10% change in the frequency of
18 floodplain inundation was selected because it accounts for a reasonable range of potential error
19 associated with the assumptions used in the various analytical and modeling techniques. The SED
20 fails to explain how the 10% change in the frequency of floodplain inundation equates to a
21 significant benefit to fish and wildlife, especially given the margin of error in which a 10% change
22 might equate to no additional floodplain.

23 g. The SWB's decision to adopt the SED for the project was not supported by
24 substantial evidence because it was based, in part, on inadequate and unsupported floodplain
25 habitat analysis.

26 h. Because the SWB's decision to adopt the SED was not supported by
27 substantial evidence, the Board's action was an abuse of discretion and its decision must be set
28 aside. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21168.5, § 21168.9.)

1 421. The SWB's decision to adopt the SED, and the findings therein, was not supported
2 by substantial evidence due to inadequacies in the temperature analysis.
3 a. The SED's temperature thresholds are deficient and do not properly identify
4 and evaluate the impacts of the project on aquatic species.

5 b. The SED measures temperature improvement by estimating the increase in
6 the number of days in which the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)
7 temperature criteria for the Pacific Northwest (EPA region 10) will be met.

8 C. The USEPA temperature criteria developed specifically for salmonids in the
9 Pacific Northwest (Region 10) does not apply to the Plan Area in California's Central Valley

10 where instream temperatures are much warmer. As the SWB's temperature analysis is based upon

11 a set of temperature criteria that are not relevant to the Plan Area, SWB's decision to adopt the

12 SED based, in part, on the benefits shown by that analysis is not supported by substantial evidence.

13 d. The SED relies on the monthly outputs obtained using the WSE Model,

14 meaning that instream water temperatures remain constant for the entire month for modeling
15 purposes. Because the Tributary UIF Objective requires daily fluctuations in flow based upon a
16 minimum 7-day running average, the model's monthly flow fails to capture daily temperature
17 fluctuations that will result from the objectives. As the SWB's decision to adopt the SED is based,
18 in a part, on a temperature analysis that fails to capture the temperature fluctuations that will be
19 created by the objectives, the decision was not supported by substantial evidence.

20 e. The SWB's temperature analysis includes mitigation measures, such as
21 minimum reservoir levels and flow shifting, that are not required by the objectives, and therefore
22 the SWB's decision to adopt the SED based, in part, upon this temperature analysis is not
23 supported by substantial evidence.

24 f. The SWB's own analysis submitted in response to public comments shows
25 that the 40% unimpaired flow, without minimum reservoir storage, will increase water

26 temperatures and adversely affect fall-run Chinook salmon. As the SWB refused to rely on this

27 analysis in adopting the SED, its decision is not based upon substantial evidence.

28

95

g. Because the SWB's decision to certify the SED was not supported by
2 substantial evidence, the Board's action was an abuse of discretion and its decision must be set
3 aside. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21168.5, § 21168.9.)

4 422. The State Water Board's decision to adopt the SED, and the findings therein, was not
5 supported by substantial evidence due to inadequacies in the reservoir impact analysis.

a. The SED fails to evaluate the impact of the project on reservoir levels, and
7 instead assumes that reservoir levels will not change because the modeling inputs were adjusted,
8 through an iterative (i.e., trial and error) process to limit fluctuations in reservoir levels by

9 declaring Carryover Storage rules and reservoir refill criteria. These model inputs or assumptions
10 are not required by the objectives.

11 b. The SED did not evaluate the project's impacts on reservoir levels in the
12 absence of Carryover Storage rules and reservoir refill criteria that were designed through an
13 iterative (i.e., trial and error) process to limit impacts.

14 C. The SWB's decision to adopt the SED for the project was not supported by
15 substantial evidence because it was based, in part, on this inadequate and inaccurate reservoir
16 impact analysis.

17 d. Because the SWB's decision to adopt the SED was not supported by
18 substantial evidence, the Board's action was an abuse of discretion and its decision must be set
19 aside. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21168.5, § 21168.9.)

20 423. The SWB's decision to adopt the SED, and the findings therein, was not supported
21 by substantial evidence due to inadequacies in the groundwater analysis.

22 a. The SED's analysis of groundwater impacts has numerous flaws.

23 b. The SED assumes that the project's reductions in available surface water
24 will be a offset on a one-to-one ratio with groundwater up to the point of the estimated maximum
25 groundwater pumping that occurred in 2009.

26 C. The SED does not disclose how the 2009 maximum pumping estimates were

27 calculated.

28

96
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 d. The assumption that groundwater pumping can or will occur at 2009 levels
2 is not based upon any analysis or information. The assumption does not evaluate the impact of
3 whether SGMA would allow 2009 level pumping.

4 e. SGMA requires that high and medium priority groundwater basins be

5 managed to achieve sustainability. Sustainability is based on the avoidance of six undesirable
6 results. These six undesirable results include: decrease in groundwater storage, elevation,

7 subsidence, degradation of water quality, intrusion of seawater, and depletion of interconnected
8 surface waters. (Wat. Code, § 10721[m].)

9 f. Simply because the SWB cannot determine "precise" implementation of
10 SGMA, does not permit it to ignore SGMA and the reasonably foreseeable impacts from the
11 implementation of SGMA. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15144.) While the specific groundwater
12 sustainability plans are not yet available, at the very least, SGMA requires the State Water Board to
13 evaluate the impact of the project on the six factors that define sustainability.

14 g. The SED fails to evaluate the impacts to individual sustainability factors in
15 any meaningful way.

16 h. The SED also uses an unsupported metric to evaluate impacts. The SED
17 estimates the decrease in groundwater by measuring each irrigation district's groundwater balance
18 and dividing by the acres in each corresponding basin. The impact of the project is estimated in the

19 metric of inches of groundwater balance per acre. This groundwater balance inches metric is not an

20 accepted measurement; it is not used by any other groundwater analysis and it is not accepted as

21 valid by any groundwater experts. The SED offers an approximate conversion of each inch of
22 groundwater balance equating to about 10 inches of groundwater elevation. However, the SWB
23 fails to explain how it analyzed the impacts of the project on the groundwater elevation of each

24 basin.

25 i. The SWB fails to accurately describe baseline groundwater conditions and
26 relies on flawed WSE Model impacts to estimate groundwater basin impacts.

27 j. The SED identifies the four groundwater basins underlying the Plan Area,
28 discloses the acres overlying each basin, denotes aquifer characteristics (e.g. formation and

97
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

deposits), and provides general information regarding water balance and groundwater movement.
2 Yet, the SED fails to describe the actual baseline condition for each groundwater basin.

3 k. The SED explains that its analysis includes several "simplifying
4 assumptions," which include the assumptions that the four connected basins are separate pools of

5 water and that each basin has no separation between shallow and deeper aquifers.

6 I. These assumptions simply misstate the characteristics, challenges and
7 specific attributes of each groundwater basin. The SED fails to provide contour maps showing
8 hydrogeologic features of each basin. The SED does not explain how water moves vertically or
9 horizontally within each basin. The SED does not estimate or summarize the estimated recharge
10 for each basin. The SED does not identify which basins have specific groundwater quantity or
11 quality challenges.

12 m. Moreover, the impact analysis uses results from the WSE Model to estimate

13 if the project would result in impacts on groundwater resources by increasing groundwater
14 pumping and reducing groundwater recharge relative to baseline water balance for each of the four

15 subbasins.

16 n. The SED's threshold of significance for determining whether groundwater
17 resources will be impacted due to subsidence is improper because, among other things, the SED
18  assumes that subsidence will only be significant where such phenomenon has previously occurred.
19 In addition, the SED concludes that subsidence is less likely to occur outside the Merced subbasin
20 because there is little evidence that soils in these subbasins are subject to inelastic compaction.
21 This conclusion is not supported by substantial evidence in the record.

22 0. The SWB's decision to adopt the SED for the project was not supported by
23 substantial evidence because it was based, in part, on inadequate and unsupported groundwater
24 analysis.

25 p. Because the SWB's decision to adopt the SED was not supported by
26 substantial evidence, the Board's action was an abuse of discretion and its decision must be set
27 aside. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21168.5, § 21168.9.)

28

98
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 424. The SWB's decision to adopt the SED, and the findings therein, was not supported

2 by substantial evidence due to inadequacies in the hydropower analysis.

3 a. The SED's evaluation of the project's impact on hydropower is based on the
4 results from the WSE Model. (SED, at 14-30.)

5 b. The WSE Model assumes any reduction from the project will be taken in
6 water deliveries and therefore reservoir storage will remain unaffected. Based on this unsupported
7 assumption, the SED concludes the project has almost no hydropower impact. (SED, at 14-39.)

8 C. The SED also does not analyze the impact on hydropower of shifting the

9 seasonal timing of water releases from reservoirs. The SED recognizes the project will decrease
10 hydropower generation during the months of July and August because of reduction in reservoir
11 releases during those months. The project will increase releases during the months of May and
12 June. Because the SED only evaluates the projected annual hydropower impacts, it fails to analyze
13 the impact of shifting hydropower generation from summer to spring. The transfer of summer
14 hydropower generation to spring hydropower generation has the potential to result in increased
15 costs, increased supply problems, and increased capacity issues.

16 d. The SED also fails to evaluate the cost and/or availability of replacement

17 energy. The loss of summer hydropower generation (high energy demand months) will require
18 stakeholders to purchase energy when it is most expensive. The SED incorrectly assumes regional
19 economic effects due to hydropower loss are "virtually imperceptible" when compared to annual
20 statewide electricity production. (SED, at 18-22.) This is conjecture; the project affects
21 hydropower sources that supply only regional customers and do not contribute to the statewide
22 grid. Therefore, the impacts of the project will be much more substantial and concentrated in the
23 Project Area. The SED improperly dilutes the regional effects by spreading the effects statewide.

24 e. The SWB's decision to adopt the SED for the project was not supported by
25 substantial evidence because it was based, in part, on inadequate and unsupported hydropower
26 analysis.

f. Because the SWB's decision to adopt the SED was not supported by
2 substantial evidence, the Board's action was an abuse of discretion and its decision must be set

3 aside. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21168.5, § 21168.9.)

425. The SWB's decision to adopt the SED, and the findings therein, was not supported

5 by substantial evidence due to inadequacies in the flood risk analysis.

426. The SWB's decision to adopt the SED, and the findings therein, was not supported
7 by substantial evidence due to inadequacies in the air quality analysis.

8 427. The SWB's decision to adopt the SED is not supported by substantial evidence

9 because the SED does not evaluate environmental impacts outside the service areas of OID, SSJID,
10 TID, MID, and Merced ID.

11 428. The SWB's decision to adopt the SED is not supported by substantial evidence
12 because the SED failed to use the best available science.

432. The State Water Board significantly changed the project by adding the Year-round
2 Objective which was not previously included in the Phase 1 Amendments. The Year-round

3 Objective was not analyzed in any version of the SED.

433. The State Water Board also changed the Tributary UIF Objective from requiring a

5 range of unimpaired flow between 30% and 50% to requiring exactly 40% unimpaired flow with an

6 adaptive range between 30% and 50% unimpaired flow.

7 434. The State Water Board also included significant new information and analysis of the
8 project in a 22-chapter Master Response to comments.

9 435. The State Water Board notified the public that it would not accept any comments on
10 the SED, and that the public comment period on the adequacy of that document concluded in March
11 2017.

12 436. The State Water Board provided the public with 21 days to respond to the new
13 changes to the Bay-Delta Plan itself, including the Year-round Objective.

14 437. In addition, California Code of Regulationis, title 14, section 15088.5(a)(4) provides
15 that recirculation is required if "[t]he draft [Environmental Impact Report ("EIR")] was SO
16 fundamentally and basically inadequate and conclusory in nature that meaningful public review and
17 comment were precluded." (See also Cal. Code. Regs., tit. 23, § 3779(e).)

18 438. The SED's analysis of San Francisco's methods of compliance with the Plan

19 Amendment is "fundamentally and basically inadequate and conclusory in nature" because, among
20 other reasons, it excludes any analysis of increased water supply rationing. Although recirculation

21 was required on this basis, the Board did not issue a new notice or recirculate the SED in violation
22 of CEQA.

23 439. The State Water Board violated its obligations under the Public Resources Code,
24 CEQA Guidelines, and California Code of Regulations, title 23, Section 3779(e) by failing to
25 recirculate the SED and new revisions to the Bay-Delta Plan for formal review and public comment.

1 EIGHTEENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 Violations of Due Process Clauses of California and U.S. Constitutions

3 (Cal. Const. Art. 1, § 7; U.S. Const., 14th Amend., § 1)
4 440. Petitioners14 reallege and incorporate herein, as if set forth in full, each and every
5 preceding allegation, inclusive, of this Petition/Complaint.

6 441. A person may not be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.
7 (Cal. Const. Art. 1, § 7; U.S. Const. 14th Amend., § 1.)
8 442. The State Water Board's adoption of the Phase 1 Amendments violates the due
9 process rights of SJTA member agencies OID, SSJID, TID, and San Francisco by effectively
10 adjudicating their water rights.
11 443. The State Water Board performs "both adjudicatory and regulatory functions in
12 allocating water rights and ensuring water quality." (Racanelli, 182 Cal.App.3d at 112 [citing
13 Wat. Code, § 174].) "In performing its regulatory function of ensuring water quality by establishing
14 water quality objectives, the Board acts in a legislative capacity. The Water Quality Control Plan
15 itself is thus a quasi-legislative document." (Racanelli, 182 Cal.App.3d at 112.) "In contrast, in
16 undertaking to allocate water rights, the Board performs an adjudicatory function." (Racanelli, 182
17 Cal.App.3d at 113 [citing Temescal Water Co. v. Dept. Public Works (1955) 44 Cal.2d 90, 100-
18 106].)
19 444. Cognizant of the "distinct attributes" of the State Water Board's "two functions," in

20 Racanelli the Court of Appeal reviewed challenges to the State Water Board's establishment of new
21 water quality objectives in its adoption of the 1978 Plan under the standard set forth in Code of

22 Civil Procedure section 1085, yet reviewed challenges to the Board's decision to implement the
23 objectives "by modifying the [P]rojects* appropriation permits to compel the [P]rojects to maintain
24 the established water quality standards" under the standard set forth in Code of Civil Procedure
25 section 1094.5. (Racanelli, 182 Cal.App.3d at 112, 114; See El Dorado Irr. Dist. V. State Water

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 "Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 applies to a writ proceeding seeking to challenge a water
2 rights decision by the Board."].)

3 445. The two distinct actions of regulation and implementation through adjudication
4 cannot be combined.

5 446. The Plan Area included in the previous SWB Water Quality Control Plan
6 proceedings for the Bay-Delta 1995 Water Quality Control Plan include the entire San Joaquin and
7 Sacramento River watersheds. (Bay-Delta 1995 WQCP, Appx. 1 p. IV-6.). The Plan Area for 1

8 Phase 1 Amendments is significantly more limited, and is confined to select portions of the San

9 Joaquin River watershed. The geographic scope of the project and project Plan Area are set forth in
10 SWB Figures ES-1 and ES-2. (SED, Executive Summary, p. ES-6 - ES-7)

11 447. The entire San Joaquin River Basin encompasses approximately 7,017,000 acres.
12 (Bay-Delta 1995 WQCP, Appx.1, p. IV-23.) The San Joaquin River Basin has approximately five
13 million irrigated acres. (United States Dept. of Agricultural, National Agricultural Statistics Service
14 database, https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov[as of June 22, 2018].)

15 448. The San Joaquin River Basin is defined in the 1995 Water Quality Control Plan as:
16 "Major tributaries to the San Joaquin include the Stanislaus, Tuolumne, Merced, Chowchilla, and
17 Fresno rivers…[i]n the Delta, the Cosumnes, Mokelumne, and Calaveras rivers…flow into the San
18 Joaquin River.." and "[o]n the west side of the basin, streams include Hospital, Del Puerto,
19 Orestimba, San Luis, and Los Banos creeks." (Bay-Delta 1995 WQCP, Appx. 1 p. IV-23.)

20 449. The five irrigation districts impacted by the State Water Board's Phase
21 Amendments that are limited to the Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers comprise

22 approximately 460,000 irrigated acres.

23 450. The SWB's Phase 1 Amendments leave out the Calaveras, Mokelumne, and
24 Cosumnes Rivers, as well as the upper San Joaquin River, Chowchilla, Fresno, Kings, and Westside

25 Tributaries.

26 451. Once the Board has adopted a water quality control plan with objectives and a
27 particular method of implementation, it must follow that plan. As relevant here, the Board must
28 follow its plan for the San Joaquin River watershed that is limited to only a subset is of water users in

103
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 that watershed. Because the Phase 1 Amendments focus only on a limited portion of the San
2 Joaquin River watershed (and an even more limited portion of the Bay-Delta watershed) where only

3 six water right holders will be impacted to the exclusion of numerous others, and because the State

4 Water Board is required to follow that plan as adopted, the Board has effectively allocated
5 responsibility for achieving the water quality objectives to those six water right holders, thereby
6 improperly adjudicating their rights in a quasi-legislative proceeding. (State Water Resources
7 Control Bd. Cases, supra, 136 Cal.App.4th at 732.) Any due process protections that may be

8 offered during the implementation phase for the objectives (such as notice and a hearing during a
9 water rights proceeding) would be ineffectual because the result would be a foregone conclusion in
10 light of the adjudication already made by the Board in adopting the Phase 1 Amendments.

11 452. Prior to the State Water Board's de facto adjudication of these six water users' water
12 rights, the State Water Board failed to comply with applicable procedural due process requirements,
13 and specifically, the Administrative Adjudication Bill of Rights.5 By not providing each water user
14  "to which the agency action is directed notice and an opportunity to be heard, including the
15 opportunity to present and rebut evidence," (Gov. Code, § 11425.10(a)(1)), the Board violated
16 Government Code section 11425.10(a)(1), Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5(b), and other
17 procedural due process requirements.

18 453. As the regulation adopted by the State Water Board effectively adjudicated the water
19 rights of a small, select group of water users in the San Joaquin River watershed, and thereby
20 exempted from such regulation thousands of other similarly situated water users, the Court should

21 apply Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, and, more specifically, the independent judgment test
22 prescribed in Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5(c), in its review of this specific challenge.

23

24

25

26 15 See Gov. Code § 11410.20(a) (applying Administrative Adjudication Bill of Rights "to all agencies of the state"); 23 CCR § 648(b) (providing that "all adjudicative proceedings before the State Board . . . shall be governed by . . . the
27 Administrative Procedures Act (commencing with section 11400 of the Government Code) (APA)" except for specific
provisions of the APA that are inapplicable.) See 23 CCR § 648(c) (identifying the portions of the APA that are
28 inapplicable to adjudicative proceedings before the Board.) As Title 23 California Code of Regulations section 648(c) does not identify the Administrative Adjudication Bill of Rights as being inapplicable to adjudicative proceedings before the Board, it applies to such proceedings.

454. Alternatively, the Court may review Petitioners' due process challenge under Code
2 of Civil Procedure section 1085. (See Mohilef v. Janovici (1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 267, 285

3 [recognizing that due process claims may be brought under a petition for traditional mandate or
4 administrative mandate].)

455. Whether the Court reviews Petitioners' due process challenge under Code of Civil

6 Procedure sections 1085 or 1094.5, the result should be the same. The Bay-Delta Plan must be set
7 aside and remanded to the State Water Board for further proceedings that ensure adequate
8 protection of the due process rights of the six water right holders in the San Joaquin River

9 watershed to which the agency's action was indisputably directed, i.e., San Francisco, Modesto

1 474. California operates under a dual, or hybrid, system of water rights which recognizes
2 both doctrines of riparian rights and appropriative rights.

3 475. As a general rule, appropriative rights are subordinate to riparian rights so that in

4 times of shortage riparian water right holders are entitled to fulfill their needs before appropriators

6 476. Between appropriators, the rule of priority is 'first in time, first in right' where the
7 senior appropriator is entitled to fulfill his or her needs before a junior appropriator is entitled to use

8 any water.

9 477. Every effort must be made by the SWB to respect and enforce the rule of priority.

10 478. The water quality objectives in 1 the Phase 1 Amendments violate the rules of water
11 right priority because they require flows from the Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers, and
12 thus the water users within those watersheds, for the purpose of protecting fish and wildlife in the
13 Bay-Delta estuary without considering, and/or requiring, flows from other watersheds within the
14 Bay-Delta estuary, and thus other water users in the Bay-Delta estuary who are junior to those water
15 users on the Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers.

16 479. Because the State Water Board's action was unlawful, this Court should issue a writ

17 of mandate directing the State Water Board to set aside its adoption of the Bay-Delta Plan, and

18 enjoin the State Water Board from taking any action to implement the Bay-Delta Plan.

19
TWENTY-FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 20

21 The Objectives in the Phase 1 Amendments are Unlawful Because They Constitute a Waste and Unreasonable Use of Water

22 (Cal. Const. Art. X, Section 2)

23 480. Petitioners reallege and incorporate herein, as if set forth in full, each and every
24| preceding allegation, inclusive, of this Petition/Complaint.

25 481. Article X, section 2 of the California Constitution prohibits the "waste or
26 unreasonable use or unreasonable method of use of water." (Cal. Const., § art. X, § 2.) Under this
27 constitutional mandate, a water user is limited to taking "only such amount [of water] as he [or she]

28

107
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F reasonably needs for beneficial purposes." (Pasadena v. Alhambra (1949) 33 Cal.2d 908, 925; see
2 also City of Barstow v. Mojave Water Agency (2000) 23 Cal.4th 1224, 1241.)

3 482. This constitutional mandate knows no exceptions and applies to "the use of all water,
4| under whatever right the use may be enjoyed." (Peabody v. Vallejo (1935) 2 Cal.2d 351, 367.) The
5 rule must be followed by water users, the State Water Board, and the courts of this State.

6 483. The State Water Board is also statutorily bound to "to prevent waste, unreasonable
7 use, unreasonable method of use, or unreasonable method of diversion of water," and is thus
8 prohibited from requiring water to be used unreasonably. (Wat. Code, § 275.)

9 484. The measure of what constitutes a "reasonable use" is a question of fact, to be
10 determined according to the circumstances of each particular case. (Environmental Defense Fund,

11 Inc. V. East Bay Mun. Utility Dist. (1980) 26 Cal.3d 183, 194, [citing Joslin v. Marin Municipal
12 Water Dist. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 132, 139-140]; see Jordan v. City of Santa Barbara (1996) 46
13 Cal.App.4th 1245, 1268.) A reasonable beneficial use in areas where water is in excess may not be a
14 reasonable beneficial use "in an area of great scarcity and great need." (Tulare Irrigation Dist. v.
15 Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation Dist. (1935) 3 Cal.2d 489, 567.) Similarly, "[w]hat is a beneficial use
16 at one time may, because of changed conditions, become a waste a a of water at a later time." (Tulare
17 Irrigation Dist. 3 supra, 3 Cal.2d at 567.)

18 485. In analyzing whether the Phase 1 Amendments comport with Article X, section 2 of

19 the Constitution, the first step requires an identification of the beneficial uses to be protected by the
20 objectives, and the quantity of water being required by the objectives to protect those beneficial

21 uses. Once the quantity of water required to protect each beneficial use is identified, the analysis

22 shifts to whether using that quantity of water to protect that beneficial use is a reasonable use of that

23 water under the circumstances.

24 486. The analysis in the SED, as well as the additional analysis provided during the public
25 comment period, demonstrate that the Phase 1 Amendments are unreasonable. Specifically,
26 requiring 40% unimpaired flow on the Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers during the month
27 of June, as required by the Tributary UIF Objectives, constitutes a waste and unreasonable use of

28 water because there are few, if any, Central Valley Fall-run Chinook salmon present and migrating

108
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

in the system at that time which would benefit from the maintenance of 40% unimpaired flow. The

2 analysis in the SED fails to address whether any of the other identified Beneficial Uses will be
3 protected by the maintenance of 40% unimpaired flow during the month of June.

4 487. Because requiring the maintenance of 40% unimpaired flow on the Stanislaus,
Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers during the month of June is not reasonably necessary to protect any

6 identified Beneficial Uses, and because such a requirement will preclude that water from being put

7 to other beneficial uses, the Tributary UIF Objectives constitute a waste and unreasonable use of

8 water in violation of Article X, section 2 of the California Constitution.

9 488. Because the Tributary UIF Objectives constitute a waste and unreasonable use of
10 water in violation of Article X, section 2 of the California Constitution, the State Water Board's

11 adoption of the Bay-Delta Plan should be set aside in its entirety, and the State Water Board should
12 be enjoined from taking any action to implement the Bay-Delta Plan.

13

14 TWENTY-SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

15 The Objectives in the Phase 1 Amendments are Unlawful Because They Violate Federal

16 Antidegradation Policy and SWRCB Resolution No. 68-16

17 489. Petitioners reallege and incorporate herein, as if set forth in full, each and every
18 preceding allegation, inclusive, of this Petition/Complaint.

19 490. The Clean Water Act requires that a state's water quality standards include an
20 antidegradation policy. (See 33 USCS § 1313[c][2][A]; 40 C.F.R. §§ 131.6; 131.11[a][1];

21 131.11[b][1],[2]; 131.12.) The EPA's regulations require the state to "develop and adopt a statewide
22 antidegradation policy" as well as "methods for implementing the antidegradation policy.' (40
23 C.F.R. § 131.12[a]-[d]; Northwest Envtl. Advocates v. United States EPA (Or. Dist. Ct. 2003), 268
24 F.Supp.2d 1255, 1264.) "Existing instream water users and the level of water quality necessary to
25 protect the existing uses shall be maintained and protected." (40 C.F.R. § 131.12[a][1].)

26 491. The State Water Board adopted Resolution No. 68-16, entitled "Statement of Policy
27 with Respect to Maintaining High Quality Waters in California." (SWRCB Resolution No. 68-16.)
28 The Board interpreted this resolution as incorporating the federal anti-degradation policy wherever

109
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 federal policy applies under federal law. By its own terms, the resolution "is to be followed in any

2 of its water right or water quality actions." (Central Delta Water Agency v. State Water Resources

3 Control Bd., (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 245, 265.) The resolution states, "[w]henever the existing
4 quality of water is better than the quality established in policies as of the date on which such

5 policies become effective, such existing high quality will be maintained until it has been

6 demonstrated to the State that any change will be consistent, will not unreasonably affect present
7 and anticipated beneficial use of such water and will not result in water quality less than that

8 prescribed in the policies." (SWRCB Resolution No. 68-16, T 1.)

9 492. The State Water Board failed to perform the necessary analysis to determine whether
10 the Phase 1 Amendments will comport with federal antidegradation requirements and Resolution

11 No. 68-16.

12 493. The 2006 Bay-Delta Plan required base flows at Vernalis from February through

13 June that range from 710 cfs to 3,420 cfs, depending on the water year classification. The 2006
14 Bay-Delta Plan also required pulse flows at Vernalis during portions of April and May that range

15 from 3,100 cfs to 8,620 cfs, depending on the water year classification.

16 494. Under the Phase 1 Amendments, the Vernalis flow requirements from the 2006 Bay-
17 Delta Plan are no longer applicable. Instead, the minimum base flow at Vernalis from February
18 through June is 800 to 1,200 cfs. The State Water Board failed to analyze whether the reduced flows
19 required at Vernalis, together with the other Tributary UIF Objectives, would comply with the
20 antidegradation requirements of the Clean Water Act and its implementing regulations, and with the
21 antidegradation requirements of SWRCB Resolution No. 68-16.

22 495. The State Water Board conclusively determined that Phase 1 Amendments "will

23 likely result in water quality improvements in the San Joaquin River (SJR) Watershed and the
24 southern Delta." (SED, at 23-2.) The only basis for this conclusion is the State Water Board's
25 assertion that "the flow objectives may be adjusted" as part of an adaptive management program if
26 monitoring and "other best available scientific information indicates that such changes will be
27 sufficient" to meet the narrative objective, i.e., that the changes will "support and maintain the
28 natural production of viable native SJR Watershed fish populations migrating through the Delta . .

110
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

(SED, at 23-4.) Rather than performing the scientific analysis necessary to ensure that the
2 amendments do not result in a degradation of water quality, the State Water Board has taken the

3 position that the scientific analysis will be performed later, and in real-time, as part of implementing

4 the plan. The failure to perform an antidegradation analysis to ensure that the proposed objectives

5 do not result in a degradation of water quality is a violation of the Clean Water Act and its
6 implementing regulations, and Resolution No. 68-16.

7 496. In addition, the State Water Board has only modeled one of the many operational
8 scenarios that are achievable under the broad range of flow scenarios permitted by the adaptive

9 adjustments in the Program of Implementation. Many of the operations that could be implemented
10 under the broad range of flow scenarios permitted by the adaptive adjustments in the Program of
11 Implementation were never modeled or analyzed, and thus the Board failed to perform the
12 antidegradation analysis that is necessary to ensure that the proposed objectives do not result in a
13 degradation of water quality in violation of the Clean Water Act and its implementing regulations,

14 and Resolution No. 68-16.

15 497. The State Water Board also relaxed the salinity requirements in the Phase
16 Amendments as compared to the 2006 Bay-Delta Plan without conducting the necessary
17 antidegradation analysis.

18 498. Finally, the Board's failure to include an antidegradation policy in the Bay-Delta
19 Plan itself is a violation of the Clean Water Act and its implementing regulations, and the provisions
20 of the Porter-Cologne Act which compel the State Water Board to comply with the Clean Water
21 Act.

22 499. Because the Phase 1 Amendments violate state and federal antidegradation
23 requirements, the State Water Board's adoption of the Bay-Delta Plan should be set aside in its
24 entirety, and the State Water Board should be enjoined from taking any action to implement the
25 Bay-Delta Plan.

TWENTY-THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

2 The State Water Board Failed to Conduct the Required Use Attainability Analysis

3 (Clean Water Act and Porter-Cologne Act)

4 500. Petitioners reallege and incorporate herein, as if set forth in full, each and every
preceding allegation, inclusive, of this Petition/Complaint.

6 501. Section 101(a)(2) of the Clean Water Act provides that, in order to "restore and

7 maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters," it is "the national
goal that wherever attainable, an interim goal of water quality which provides for the protection and
propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife and provides for recreation in and on the water be
10 achieved by July 1, 1983." (33 U.S.C., § 1251[a][2].)

11 502. The State Water Board is required to adopt designated uses that are consistent with
12 the requirements of the Clean Water Act. (40 C.F.R., § 131.5[a][1].)

13 503. Whenever the State Water Board "wishes to remove a designated use that is
14 specified in section 101(a)(2) of the Act, to remove a sub-category of such a use, or to designate a
15 sub-category of such a use that requires criteria less stringent than previously applicable," the Board
16 must conduct a "use attainability analysis." (40 C.F.R., § 131.10 [j][2].)

17 504. The State Water Board is required by the Porter-Cologne Act to comply with the
18 Clean Water Act and its implementing regulations.

19 505. The Bay-Delta Plan provides that "[t]he fish and wildlife beneficial uses designated

20 in the "Water Quality Control Plan for the Sacramento River Basin and San Joaquin River Basin'

21 ["SR/SJR Basin Plan"] for the Stanislaus River, Tuolumne River, Merced River, and San Joaquin
22 River from the mouth of Merced River to Vernalis remain in effect and this plan includes measures

23 to protect those uses." (SED, Appx. K, at 10 [emphasis added].) However, by operation of law, the
24 beneficial uses identified in the Bay-Delta Plan supersede those identified in the SR/SJR Basin Plan

25 to the extent of any conflict, thereby eliminating any beneficial uses from the SR/SJR Basin Plan
26 that are not included in the Bay-Delta Plan insofar as the plans overlap geographically. (Wat. Code,

27 von 13170.) Since the Bay-Delta Plan does not include two fish and wildlife beneficial uses that are
28 identified in the SR/SJR Basin Plan ("Preservation of Biological Habitats of Special Significance

112
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 [BIOL]" and "Aquaculture [AQUA]"), those two uses were effectively removed from the SR/SJR
2 Basin Plan when the State Water Board adopted the superseding Bay-Delta Plan. The Board failed
3 to conduct the required use attainability analysis when it removed BIOL and AQUA beneficial uses
4 from the SR/SJR Basin Plan to the extent it overlaps geographically with the Bay-Delta Plan.

5 506. Furthermore, the Bay-Delta Plan and the SR/SJR Basin Plan both include "Warm
6 Freshwater Habitat (WARM)" as a beneficial use. However, the Bay-Delta Plan defines this
7 beneficial use as follows: "[u]ses of water that support warm water ecosystems including . ..

8 preservation of aquatic habitats, vegetation, fish, or wildlife, including invertebrates." (SED,

9 Appendix K., 11.) The SR/SJR Basin Plan defines this beneficial use differently by adding the word
10 "enhancement" to the definition: "[u]ses of water that support warm water ecosystems including ..
11 preservation or enhancement of aquatic habitats, vegetation, fish, or wildlife, including
12 invertebrates." (SR/SJR Basin WQCP, II-2.00 [emphasis added].) Therefore, by adopting the Bay-
13 Delta Plan, the State Water Board superseded the more expansive definition of "Warm Freshwater

14 Habitat" in the SR/SJR Basin Plan which included "enhancement" of habitat, vegetation, fish,
15 and/or wildlife. (Wat. Code, § 13170.) In doing so, the State Water Board either removed a sub-
16 category of the WARM beneficial use, or created a less stringent criteria than previously applicable,

17 and thus was required to conduct a "use attainability analysis." (40 C.F.R., § 131.10 [jl[2].) By
18 failing to conduct such an analysis, the State Water Board violated the Clean Water Act and its
19| obligation under the Porter-Cologne Act to comply with the Clean Water Act.

20 507. Accordingly, the State Water Board's adoption of the Bay-Delta Plan should be set
21 aside in its entirety, and the State Water Board should be enjoined from taking any action to
22 implement the Bay-Delta Plan.

The State Water Board Failed to Adopt Water Quality Standards that

4 (Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. § 1251, et seq. and Porter-Cologne Act)

5 508. Petitioners reallege and incorporate herein, as if set forth in full, each and every
6 preceding allegation, inclusive, of this Petition/Complaint.

7 509. The Clean Water Act's implementing regulations require states to adopt water
8 quality criteria that protect the designated use. "Such criteria must be based on sound scientific
9 rationale and must contain sufficient parameters or constituents to protect the designated use. For
10 waters with multiple use designations, the criteria shall support the most sensitive use." (40
11 C.F.R., § 131.11[a].)

12 510. In adopting the Bay-Delta Plan, the State Water Board failed to use a sound scientific
13 rationale in developing, supporting, and adopting its water quality objectives for the protection of
14 fish and wildlife. Instead, the Board used the anticipated production numbers for Central Valley
15 fall-run Chinook salmon as a proxy for assessing whether the a beneficial uses identified in the plan
16 were reasonably protected by the objectives. The Board failed to conduct any analysis by which it
17 could determine the most sensitive use of the identified beneficial uses, and failed to otherwise
18 analyze whether the objectives would support the most sensitive use. The Board did not provide any
19 scientific rationale which would support a conclusion that production of Central Valley fall-run
20 Chinook salmon constitute the most sensitive use.

21 511. Accordingly, the State Water Board's adoption of the Bay-Delta Plan should be set
22 aside in its entirety, and the State Water Board should be enjoined from taking any action to

3 Because They Violate FERC's Exclusive Jurisdiction

512.
4 Petitioners" reallege and incorporate herein, as if set forth in full, each and every
preceding allegation, inclusive, of this Petition/Complaint.
5
513. The Phase 1 Amendments are unlawful because the State Water Board does not have
6
jurisdiction to set minimum stream flows on the Tuolumne and Merced Rivers.
7
514. As held by the United States Supreme Court, the United States District Court for the 8
Ninth Circuit, and a California Appellate Court, under the Federal Power Act, FERC "occupies the
9

10 field" of hydropower operations. (See California v. FERC (1990) 495 U.S. 490; See Sayles Hydo

11 Associates v. Maughan (9th Cir. 1993) 985 F.2d 451 [hereafter Sayles]; See Karuk Tribe of

12 Northern California v. California Regional Water Quality Control Bd., North Coast Region (2010)

13 183 Cal.App.4th 330 [hereafter Karuk].) Under these holdings, all state regulation of hydropower

14 operations is preempted except for that concerning proprietary rights to water. (Sayles, supra, 985

15 F.2d 456; see also Karuk, supra, 183 Cal.App.4th at 350.)

515.
16 The U.S. Supreme Court has held that state regulations for the protection of fish and

17 wildlife resources do not concern proprietary rights and are thus preempted if applied to a FERC

18 licensee. (California v. FERC, supra, 495 U.S. at 498.) Relevant here, California v. FERC

19 specifically invalidated a State Water Board action that attempted to set minimum instream flows in

20 excess of those set forth 1n a FERC license. (Id., at 506.)

516. The Phase 1 Amendments present the same issue that was presented in California v. 21

22 FERC. The State Water Board proposed to regulate minimum stream flows on rivers over which
FERC has exclusive jurisdiction. (SED, at 1-8 [*The State Water Board is considering amending the 23
Bay-Delta Plan to establish new flow objectives on the LSJR and its three eastside tributaries to 24

25 protect fish and wildlife beneficial uses."].) As in California v. FERC, the State Water Board does

26 not have the jurisdiction to set minimum instream flows on FERC regulated rivers through a state
regulation. 27

28

17 MID is not participating as a member of the SJTA in this cause of action.
115
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

517. Instead, the State Water Board is limited to its Clean Water Act ("CWA") section
2 401 certification authority when it comes to FERC-regulated streams. (PUD No. 1 of Jefferson
3 County v. Washington Dept. of Ecology (1994) 511 U.S. 700, 712.) Under this authority, States may

4 include requirements in a certification issued under section 401 of the CWA insofar as "necessary to
5 enforce a designated use contained in a state water quality standard." (Id., at 723.) Section 401
6 certifications are an integral part of the FERC licensing process. (See Id., at 708-709.) Despite

7 possessing this authority, the State Board instead adopted minimum stream flows on the Tuolumne

8 and Merced Rivers through the Phase Amendments.

9 518. As the flows of the Tuolumne and Merced Rivers are under FERC jurisdiction, the
10 State Water Board is limited to acting pursuant to its CWA section 401 authority and cannot set
11 instream flow requirements through regulatory action. For this reason, the adoption of the Phase
12 Amendments is unlawful and preempted by the Federal Power Act.

13 519. Accordingly, the State Water Board's adoption of the Bay-Delta Plan should be set
14 aside in its entirety, and the State Water Board should be enjoined from taking any action to
15 implement the Bay-Delta Plan.

20| preceding allegation, inclusive, of this Petition/Complaint.

21 521. The Phase 1 Amendments state that increased flow from the Stanislaus, Tuolumne,

24 through the Lower San Joaquin River flow objectives, which will increase inflow of low salinity
25 water into the southern Delta during February through June and thereafter under adaptive

28

18 MID is not participating as a member of the SJTA in this cause of action.
116
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

522. The State Water Board recognized in Water Rights Decision 1641 that, in certain
it 2 circumstances, it is not a reasonable use of water to require upstream water right holders to release
3 or bypass extra water to dilute downstream salinity. The State Water Board determined that the

4 diversion of water on the Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers was not the primary cause of
5 salinity problems, and that return flow from upstream diversions of water does not contribute
6 significantly to the salt loading in the San Joaquin River. Instead, the Board recognized that
7 approximately 35% of the salt load at Vernalis comes from the northwest side of the San Joaquin
8 River, and approximately 37% of the salt load comes from the Grasslands area; those areas receive

9 approximately 70% of their water supply from the Central Valley Project. The Board concluded that

10 "the actions of the CVP are the principal cause of the salinity concentrations exceeding the
11 objectives at Vernalis." As such, the Board determined that, under the rule articulated in Town of
12 Antioch v. Williams Irrig. Dist. (1922) 188 Cal. 451, it "would not be reasonable" to require a
13 reduction in diversions by senior water right holders on the Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced
14 Rivers who put those diversions to beneficial uses such as irrigation, hydropower generation,
15 recreation, and fish and wildlife enhancement, "since water quality objectives can and should be
16 attained through regulation of other controllable factors." (D-1641, at 80-82.)

17 523. The Bay-Delta Plan shifts the burden of salinity reduction to senior water right
18 holders on the Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers in contravention of the State Water
19 Board's prior conclusion that it would be an unreasonable use of water to reduce diversions by
20 senior water right holders on those rivers for the purposes of managing salinity in the Delta and in
21 violation of the rules of Town of Antioch.

22 524. Accordingly, the State Water Board's adoption of the Bay-Delta Plan should be set
23 aside in its entirety, and the State Water Board should be enjoined from taking any action to
24 implement the Bay-Delta Plan.

3

4 525. Petitioners reallege and incorporate herein, as if set forth in full, each and every
5 preceding allegation, inclusive, of this Petition/Complaint.

6 526. One of the purposes of the Delta Reform Act ("DRA") (Wat. Code, § 85000 et seq.)

7 is "to establish an accelerated process to determine instream flow needs of the Delta for the
8 purposes of facilitating planning decisions that are required to achieve the objectives of the Delta
9 Plan." (Wat. Code, § 85086[b].) The term "Delta Plan" refers to "the comprehensive, long-term
10 management plan for the Delta" developed by the Delta Stewardship Council. (Wat. Code, §

11 85059.)

12 527. The legislature directed the SWB to "develop new flow criteria for the Delta
13 Ecosystem necessary to protect public trust resources" using "the best available scientific
14 information." (Wat. Code, § 85086[c][1].) The new flow criteria was to be used to inform the
15 planning decisions for two processes: (1) the newly required Delta Plan to be developed by the
16 Delta Stewardship Council, and (2) the Bay Delta Conservation Plan, which is now known as

17 California WaterFix and EcoRestore. (Wat. Code, § 85086[c][1].) The DRA does not identify the
18 State Water Board's Bay-Delta Plan as being one of the processes to be informed by the new flow

19 criteria.

20 528. The DRA also directed the Board to provide the legislature with a "prioritized
21 schedule and estimate of costs to complete instream flow studies for the Delta and for high priority
22 rivers and streams in the Delta watershed, not otherwise covered by Section 85086." (Wat. Code, §

23 85087.) The SWB completed the "Prioritized Schedule and Estimate of Costs" in 2010 and
24 submitted it to the legislature. The SWB identified the San Joaquin, Tuolumne, and Merced rivers
25 as high priority rivers, not otherwise covered by Section 85086. Accordingly, the SWB was to
26 conduct and complete instream flow studies for these rivers.

27 529. The Delta Stewardship Council's Final Delta Plan (2013) directed the SWB to adopt,
28 and as soon as reasonably possible, implement flow objectives for high-priority tributaries in the

118
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- Delta watershed that are necessary to achieve the coequal goals of the Delta Plan. To fulfill its
2 obligations under the Delta Plan, the SWB created Phase 4 of the Bay-Delta water quality control
3 plan update process. Consistent with the Board's obligation to protect public trust resources, and in

4

5 accordance with the adjudicatory nature of public trust proceedings, the Board initially stated that it

6 would fulfill its obligations under the Delta Plan in Phase 4 through the adjudicatory process of

7 conditioning water rights and other appropriate measures.

530.

8 By the time the State Water Board adopted the Phase Amendments, it eliminated
Phase 4 and the adjudicatory process proposed to accompany it. Instead, the Board effectively
9 incorporated the Phase 4 adjudicatory process of conditioning water rights on high-priority
10 tributaries into Phase 1. Specifically, the Bay-Delta Plan states, "The 2018 update of the San

11 Joaquin River flow objectives implements the Delta Stewardship Council's Delta Plan
12 recommendation for the State Water Board to adopt, and as soon as reasonably possible, implement

13 flow objectives for high priority tributaries in the Delta watershed that are necessary to achieve the
14 co-equal goals." (SED, Appendix K, Revised Water Quality Control Plan, at 6.)

15 531. This process unlawfully subverts the quasi-adjudicatory public trust process that had
16| been developed as part of Phase 4 by incorporating that process into the quasi-legislative water
17 quality control plan update for Phase 1. By using a quasi-legislative process to accomplish the
18 quasi-adjudicatory actions that had been outlined for Phase 4, the SWB has acted unlawfully and

19 violated the DRA.

20 532. Accordingly, the State Water Board's adoption of the Bay-Delta Plan should be set
21 aside in its entirety, and the State Water Board should be enjoined from taking any action to
22 implement the Bay-Delta Plan.

TWENTY-EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 The SWB Failed to Adopt a Sufficient Statement of Overriding Considerations with the Requisite Balancing of Economic, Legal, Social, Technological, or Other Benefits
3

4 533. Petitioners l9 reallege and incorporate herein, as if set forth in full, each and every

5 preceding allegation, inclusive, of this Petition/Complaint.

6 534. The SED concluded the adoption and implementation of the Phase 1 Amendments
7 will have significant and unavoidable environmental impacts. Before the Board is able to approve a
8 project with such impacts, the law requires it adopt a statement of overriding considerations. This
9 statement must include an express determination that the project's benefits outweigh any potential
10 environmental harm. (Pub. Resources Code, 21081(b); 14 CCR 15043, 15093.) The statement of

11 overriding considerations is sufficient if it "demonstrate[s] the balance struck" by an agency in
12 "weighing the benefits of the proposed project against its unavoidable adverse impacts."
13 (Concerned Citizens of South Central L.A. v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist. (1994) 24
14 Cal.App.4th 826, 849.) In addition, the statement of overriding considerations must be supported by
15 substantial evidence contained in the record. (14 CCR 15093(b).)

16 535. The Board issued a statement of findings and overriding considerations ("OC
17 Findings") that is insufficient. The OC Findings recognize the Phase 1 Amendments would result in
18 several significant and unavoidable impacts. For several of the projected impacts, the OC Findings
19 explained that mitigation could be taken by agencies other than the Board. However, the most
20 critical part of the OC Findings - the part where the Board must explain how the benefits of the

21 Phase 1 Amendments outweigh these projected impacts - does not exist. The Board does not

22 provide an express finding or determination that the project's benefits outweigh any potential harm.

23 536. Because sufficient OC Findings are a pre-requisite to adopting the Phase
24 Amendments and because the OC Findings are not sufficient, the adoption of the Bay-Delta Plan
25 must be set aside, and the State Water Board should be enjoined from taking any action to
26 implement the Bay-Delta Plan.

1 TWENTY-NINTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 The Carryover Storage Requirement Violates the Constitution Because it

3 Amounts to Unlawful Physical Taking without Compensation

4 537. Petitioners20 reallege and incorporate herein, as if set forth in full, each and every
5 preceding allegation, inclusive, of this Petition/Complaint.
6 538. The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that "private
7 property" shall not be "taken for public use, without just compensation." (U.S. Const., 5th Amend.)
8 This provision is applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. (Chicago, B. & Q.
9 Railroad Co. v. Chicago (1897) 166 U.S. 226.) "[A] permanent physical occupation authorized by
10 government is a taking [per se] without regard to the public interests that it may serve." (Loretto v.
11 Teleprompter Manhattan Catv Corp. (1982) 458 U.S. 419, 426.) In other words, "when the
12 physical intrusion reaches the extreme form of a permanent physical occupation, a taking has
13 occurred." (Id.)
14 539. The ability to store water in a reservoir is a property right. (Marin Water & Power
15 Co. v. Railroad Com. of California (1916) 171 Cal. 706, 715 [to the extent that the railroad
16 commission held that the ability of "water storage" derived from the features of the land "was not a
17 property right, it was in error"].) Encompassed within the right to store water in a reservoir is the
18 ability to draw down (i.e., deliver) stored water and fill the reservoir back up.
19 540. The U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly found that physical occupation of property
20 through flooding or inundation is taking. (Loretto, supra, 458 U.S. at 428, citing United States v.
21 Lynah (1903) 188 U.S. 445, 468-470; Bedford v. United States (1904) 192 U.S. 217, 225; United
22 States v. Cress (1917) 243 U.S. 316, 327 - 328; Sanguinetti v. United States (1924) 264 U.S. 146,
23 149; United States v. Kansas City Life Ins. Co. (1950) 339 U.S. 799, 809 - 810.) In this context, the
24 physical taking must "constitute an actual, permanent invasion of the land, amounting to an
25 appropriation of, and not merely an injury to, the property." (Sanguinetti, supra, 264 U.S. at 149.)

121
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

541. The WSE model includes carryover storage requirements that restrict New Melones

2 Reservoir (on the Stanislaus River), New Don Pedro Reservoir (on the Tuolumne River), and Lake

3 McClure (on the Merced River) from being drawn below certain levels.

542. The Bay-Delta Plan's minimum carryover storage requirements require the SJTA

5 member agencies - and any other water right holders - that own and operate New Melones

6 Reservoir, New Don Pedro Reservoir, and Lake McClure to hold a certain minimum amount of
7 water in their reservoirs, thereby permanently occupying physical space in the reservoirs. (SED, at
Appx. F.1, p. F.1-36 - F.1-37.) The bottom of these reservoirs will be permanently occupied by the
9 State of California because the SWB will have effectively taken possession of the storage space at
10 the bottom of the reservoir and the right to use the water that is inundating the reservoir to satisfy

11 the carryover storage requirement. The minimum storage requirement will prevent any SJTA
12 member agency, or any other water right holder, from putting the water held in the bottom of a
13 reservoir to beneficial use.

14 543. Consequently, by permanently occupying the bottom of these reservoirs, the
15 carryover storage requirement shrinks the usable storage capacity of the impacted reservoirs.
16 Shrinking the usable storage capacity of impacted reservoirs injures the reservoir operator in two

17 ways.

18 544. First, the minimum carryover storage requirements will prevent reservoir operators
19 from putting water stored at the bottom of the reservoir - below the minimum carryover storage

20 targets (i.e., reservoir elevation) - to beneficial use. For example, take a scenario whereby an

21 impacted reservoir has 750,000 acre-feet of water in storage. Without the Bay-Delta Plan's
22 minimum carryover storage requirement, reservoir operators could, hypothetically, deliver 600,000
23 acre-feet by releasing water to downstream users. After releasing 600,000 acre-feet of stored water,
24 this reservoir would have 150,000 acre-feet remaining in storage.

25 545. However, the same scenario with a minimum carryover storage requirement of
26 700,000 acre-feet would restrict delivery to 50,000 acre-feet. The reservoir operator could not

27 release any portion of the remaining 700,000 acre-feet of stored water because 700,000 acre-feet is
28 required by the SWB to meet the minimum carryover storage requirements. Consequently, the Bay-

122
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Delta Plan's minimum carryover storage requirement injures reservoir operators by shrinking the

2 usable capacity of the reservoir and preventing operators from releasing water stored below the
3 minimum carryover storage requirements.

4 546. In addition to reducing the usable capacity, the Bay-Delta Plan effectively raises the

5 minimum pool level of reservoirs, restricting the ability to capture water during high-flow events. In
6 the above no-minimum example, after releasing 600,000 acre-feet of water, reservoir operators

7 would have available storage space equal to 'maximum capacity' minus (-) 150,000 acre-feet for
8 capturing and storing new water.

9 547. However, with a minimum carryover storage requirement of 700,000 acre-feet,
10 reservoir operators would have available storage space equal to 'maximum capacity' minus (-)

11 700,000 for capturing and storing new water (i.e., 550,000 acre-feet less than the no-minimum
12 example).

13 548. By permanently occupying physical space in reservoirs, the SWB commits a
14 physical taking of reservoir space per se without providing just compensation.

15 549. Accordingly, the State Water Board's adoption of the Bay-Delta Plan should be set
16 aside in its entirety, and the State Water Board should be enjoined from taking any action to
17 implement the Bay-Delta Plan.

18
THIRTIETH CAUSE OF ACTION
19
The Carryover Storage Requirements Constitute an Unlawful
20 Regulatory Taking without Compensation

21 550. Petitioners reallege and incorporate herein, as if set forth in full, each and every
22 preceding allegation, inclusive, of this Petition/Complaint.

23 551. The Bay-Delta Plan's minimum carryover storage requirement constitutes a
24 | regulatory taking. "While property may be regulated to a certain extent, if [a government]
25 regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking." (Murr v. Wisconsin (2017) 137 S. Ct.
26 1933, 1942, quoting Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon (1922) 260 U.S. 393, 415.) This type of
27 taking is known as a "regulatory taking." (Murr v. Wisconsin, supra, 137 S. Ct. at 1942.) In

21 MID is not participating as a member a of the SJTA in this cause of action.
123
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 essence, court in regulatory taking actions evaluate whether a regulatory action is functionally

2 equivalent to the classic taking where government directly appropriates private property. (MHC
3 Fin. Ltd. P'ship v. City of San Rafael (9th Cir. 2013) 714 F.3d 1118, 1127, quoting Lingle v.
4 Chevron (2005) 544 U.S. 528, 539.)

5 552. When a regulation impedes the use of property without depriving the owner of all
6 economically beneficial use, a regulatory taking still may be found based on "a complex of factors"
7 including (1) the economic impact of the regulation on the claimant; (2) the extent to which the
8 regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations; and (3) the character of the
9 government action. (Palazzolo v. Rhode Island (2001) 533 U.S. 606, 617, citing Penn Cent.
10 Transp. Co. v. New York City (1978) 438 U.S. 104, 124.)

11 553. The Supreme Court has stressed that the first two factors are the most important.
12 (Colony Cove Props., LLC v. City of Carson (9th Cir. 2018) 888 F.3d 445, fn. 9, citing Lingle v.
13 Chevron, supra, 544 U.S. at 538-539 [*Primary among those factors are the economic impact of the
14 regulation on the claimant and, particularly, the extent to which the regulation has interfered with
15 distinct investment-backed expectations. (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)"].) When
16 evaluating whether a regulatory taking has occurred, Courts make an "ad hoc, factual inquiry."
17| (Penn Cent. Transp. Co. v. New York City, supra, 438 U.S. at 124.)

18 554. The WSE model includes carryover storage requirements that restrict New Melones
19 Reservoir (on the Stanislaus River), New Don Pedro Reservoir (on the Tuolumne River, and Lake

20 McClure (on the Merced River) from being drawn below certain levels.

21 555. The carryover storage requirement, and any objectives which may require a
22 carryover storage requirement, will cause substantial interference with SJTA member investment-
23 backed expectations. Specifically, the Bay-Delta Plan would interfere with the districts'
24 expectations as to the amount of water they can capture in their reservoir and put to beneficial use.
25 Each reservoir has a capacity limit, and that limit was chosen and invested in, in part, to
26 accommodate the owners' needs and water rights. It was not chosen to accommodate a carryover

27 storage requirement by the Board. The SJTA a member agencies have a substantial investment-

28

124
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 backed expectation that they will be able to use and operate their reservoirs within their dead pool
2 and flood-control capacity limits rather than within artificial limits created by the Bay-Delta Plan.

3 556. Moreover, a significant economic impact will likely befall the SJTA member
4 agencies, and other affected water right holders, because adjusting the capacity limit of a reservoir
5 to maintain initial expectations regarding available storage would come at considerable financial
6 expense, assuming such a modification were even feasible. Further, water deliveries will be
7 impacted because carryover storage requirements will mandate that a minimum quantity of water
8 remain in the reservoir. Relatedly, because the minimum carryover storage requirements will limit
9 the amount of water SJTA members can store in the reservoir, SJTA members will at times have to
10 bypass flows (i.e., release water) that otherwise could have been stored and later delivered to

11 customers.

12 557. As to the third factor, the "character of the government action," the Supreme Court
13 has cautioned that a taking may more readily be found when the interference with property can be
14 characterized as a physical invasion by government than when interference arises from some public
15 program adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life to promote the common good. (Penn
16 Cent. Transp. Co. v. New York City, supra, 438 U.S. at 124.) Here, requiring SJTA member
17 agencies to store a minimum amount of water in their reservoirs is akin to the SWB physically
18 invading sections of SJTA member agencies' land by permanently filling the bottom of the
19 reservoirs. The bottom of the reservoirs will be physically occupied and the SWB will have taken
20 the right to put that water to beneficial use. No SJTA member agency, nor any other water right
21 holder, will be able to put the water held in the bottom of a reservoir to beneficial use.
22 Consequently, the character of the government action is that it constitutes a physical invasion of

23 SJTA member agencies' property.

24 558. Thus, because the Bay-Delta plan will have an enormous economic impact on the

25 SJTA member agencies, eviscerate the agencies' investment-backed expectations, and amounts to a

26 physical invasion by the government of property, a regulatory taking has occurred.
