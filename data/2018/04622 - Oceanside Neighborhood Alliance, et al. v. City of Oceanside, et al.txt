16 PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND HISTORY

17 10. The Project site is located on the north side of Oceanside Boulevard, west of Interstate 5,

18 between Vine Street and Clementine Street, in the City of Oceanside. Surrounding land uses include
19 single-family residences to the west, a former grocery store and planned City sewer pump station to the

20 northeast, and Oceanside Boulevard to the southeast. The site abuts a parcel which is currently being
21 developed with multi-family residential uses.

22 11. The site was designated in the City's General Plan as Single-Family Detached Residential

23 and zoned Single-Family Residential.

24 12. The 2.32-acre site is vacant and moderately to steeply sloping. Site elevations range from

25 approximately 20 feet to approximately 100 feet above mean sea level. A mix of non-native and native

26 vegetation is present on the site.

27 13. The Project would construct a three- and four-story 55,167 square foot hotel, which would

28 include 99 rooms, an outdoor swimming pool, breakfast service area, fitness room, lobby area, and

Oceanside Neighborhood Alliance v. City of Oceanside Page
Writ Petition

1 parking garage. It would require approximately 35,700 cubic yards of cut and 4,600 cubic yards of fill,

2 resulting in a net export of approximately 31,000 cubic yards of material. Upon completion of

3 grading, a 2:1 manufactured slope would be constructed along a portion of the Project's frontage, and a

4 1.5:1 cut slope would be constructed at the rear of the Project site. The 2:1 slope would range between

5 0 and 19 feet in height and the 1.5:1 slope would range from 0 to 0 34 feet in height. The Project would

6 change the site's zoning to commercial.

7 14. The Project sought a conditional use permit to allow for a reduction in the City's parking

8 standards. Under existing standards, the Project would be required to provide 119 parking spaces, but

9 the Project would provide 99 parking spaces.

10 15. The Project also sought a variance to allow construction of walls as tall as 17 feet where six

11 feet is the maximum allowed by City standards.

12 16. On or about April 21, 2016, a Draft EIR regarding the Project was made available for

13 public review. The City received 35 comment letters on the Draft EIR, including from Petitioner and

14 Petitioner's members.

15 17. Additional comments were submitted after the close of the comment period on the draft

16 EIR.

17 18. Comments noted the Project's impacts, including on biological resources, community

18 character, traffic, safety, geologic hazards, land use, parking, noise, lighting and other issues.

19 19. The final EIR acknowledged significant unmitigated cumulative impacts to traffic and

20 transportation.

21 20. Additional comments were submitted prior to and during hearings on the Project. They

22 raised several concerns, including but not limited to slope stability, traffic, ingress and egress, noise,

23 lights, blasting and vibration, stormwater, flooding, safety, community character, land use, grading,
24 incompatibility with the sensitive receptors at nearby schools, cumulative effects, and the lack of

25 adequate consideration of alternatives.

26 21. On January 22, 2018, the Planning Commission met to the consider the Project and EIR.

27 Testimony, including from Petitioner's members, was received regarding several concerns. The

28 Planning Commission voted 6 to to reject the Project and EIR.

Oceanside Neighborhood Alliance v. City of Oceanside Page 4
Writ Petition

1 22. On February 26, 2018, the Planning Commission adopted Resolution No. 2018-P04.

2 Among other things, the Planning Commission determined the Project would have no benefit to the

3 City, was inconsistent with the General Plan, was incompatible with the existing adjacent residential

4 uses, would have negative visual impacts, and would create objectionable noise. It also determined the

5 Project was inconsistent with zoning, did nothing to preserve the character and quality of the

6 surrounding neighborhood, would contribute to commercial sprawl, was too intense for the site, would
exacerbate unsafe traffic conditions, and would not provide adequate parking. The Planning
Commission also determined that the area could not be adequately served by existing public facilities.

9 23. On or about March 2, 2018, Real Party in Interest filed an appeal of the Planning

10 Commission's denial.

11. 24. Subsequent to the Planning Commission hearing, the applicant's consultants prepared

12 additional analyses, but the EIR was not recirculated for public review.

13 25. Comments were also submitted by several parties, including Petitioner and Petitioner's

14 members, regarding several issues and concerns about the Project and its potential impacts.

15 26. On May 9, 2018, the City Council met to consider the Project and EIR. Testimony,

16 including from Petitioner's members, was received regarding several concerns. Among other things,

17 commenters noted the Project would have no benefit to the City, was inconsistent with the General

18 Plan, was incompatible with the existing adjacent residential uses, would have negative visual impacts,

19 and would create objectionable noise, was inconsistent with zoning, did nothing to preserve the

20 character and quality of the surrounding neighborhood, would contribute to commercial sprawl, was

21 too intense for the site, would exacerbate unsafe traffic conditions, and would not provide adequate

22 parking. Commenters also noted the area could not be adequately served by existing public facilities

23 27. Despite these concerns, the City Council voted 3 to 2 to uphold the appeal and approve the

24 Project and EIR. The approvals included changes that were not analyzed in the EIR, including the

25 ingress and egress for the Project site.

26 28. Approvals included: (1) a resolution approving the EIR, adopting findings of fact, a

27 mitigation, monitoring and reporting program, and a statement of overriding considerations; (2) a

28 resolution approving a General Plan Amendment (GPA15-00004) to change the land use designation of

Oceanside Neighborhood Alliance v. City of Oceanside Page
Writ Petition

1 APN 152-320-37 from Single-Family Detached-Residential to General Commercial; (3) a resolution

2 approving a Zone Amendment (ZA15-00009) to change the zoning designation of APN 152-320-37 from

3 Single-Family Residential to Recreational Commercial; and (4) a resolution granting the appeal of the

4 Planning Commission's denial of and approving a Development Plan (D15-00022), a Conditional Use

5 Permit (CUP15-00023), a Conditional Use Permit (CUP15-00024), and a Variance (V15-00002).

6 29. On May 11, 2018, the City filed a Notice of Determination.
30. On May 23, 2018, the City Council met and considered an ordinance approving the Zone

8 Amendment. Testimony, including from Petitioner's members, was received regarding several

9 concerns.

8 3 31. Despite these concerns, the City Council voted 3 to 2 to approve the Project.
EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

12 AND INADEQUATE REMEDIES AT LAW

13 32. Petitioner exhausted all available administrative remedies, and objections to the Project

14 have been presented orally and in writing to the City, as required by Public Resources Code Section

15 21177. These include, but are not limited to, letters and oral comments presented during public

16 hearings.

17 33. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code Section 21167.5

18 by mailing a written notice of commencement of this action to the City. A true and correct copy of

19 that notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.

20 34. Petitioner has advised the City that Petitioner has elected to prepare the record of

21 proceedings relevant to the approval of the Project, pursuant to Public Resources Code Section

Writ Petition

1 55. The Project violates and is inconsistent with the City's General Plan, including Policies

2 1.12(A), 1.12(B), 1.12(C) and Sections 1.24 and 1.25 of the Land Use Element, as the Project is

3 inconsistent with existing adjacent single-family residences, will have a negative visual impact on

4 surrounding land uses, and will create objectionable noise which will have a negative impact on

5 surrounding land uses.

6 56. The Project violates and is inconsistent with existing zoning, including constituting spot
zoning, and will have negative impacts on the surrounding neighborhood, is inconsistent with existing

8 neighborhoods, does nothing to preserve the character and quality of the surrounding neighborhood,

9 will contribute to commercial sprawl, is too intense for the site, will be detrimental to public safety,

10 will be detrimental to the general welfare, will have negative impacts to surrounding neighborhoods,

11 and will exacerbate existing unsafe traffic conditions.
