CORPORATION FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Petitioner Davis Coalition for Sensible Planning ("Petitioner") seeks a writ of mandamus
2 against Respondent City of Davis ("City" or "Respondent") and alleges as follows:
3 INTRODUCTION

4 1. This petition challenges the City's February 6, 2018 decisions, and all subsequent
5 actions, in approving: an Addendum to a previously-certified Environmental Impact Report; a

6 General Plan Amendment; a Development Agreement; Prezoning and Preliminary Planned
7 Development; a Determination to place the project on the June 2018 ballot for voter
8 consideration under Measure R (Davis Municipal Code, §§ 41.01.010 et seq.); and other
9 associated entitlements (collectively "Entitlements"). These Entitlements purport to authorize a
10 revised development project known as the Nishi Residential Development Project' (the
11 "Revised Project"), which modified the previously-considered (and voter rejected) Nishi
12 Gateway Mixed-Use Innovation District ("Original Project"). The Revised Project includes
13 2,200 residential "beds" in approximately 700 two- and three-bedroom multifamily rental units,
14 up to 10,000 square feet of ancillary retail, and 700 vehicle spaces. The project site is located in
15 unincorporated Yolo County between the University of California at Davis and the Interstate 80,

16 and is approximately 47 acres of undeveloped land with an Agriculture land use designation (the
17 "Nishi Property").

18 2. Petitioner seeks a writ of mandamus invalidating the City's approval of the EIR
19 Addendum and invalidating and setting aside the Revised Project's Entitlements since, as more

20 fully set forth below, the City has violated the California Environmental Quality Act, the
21 Planning and Zoning law, the Davis Municipal Code, and other laws.
22 PARTIES

23 3. Petitioner Davis Coalition for Sensible Planning ("Petitioner') is an
24 unincorporated association whose members are residents of the City of Davis, California.
25 Petitioner's members include Susan Rainier, a Davis resident and California-licensed architect

26 with international design and construction experience. Ms. Rainier is Chair of AIA Central
27

28 Planning Application #14-57, General Plan Amendment #08-14, and Rezoning/PPD #06-14.

2 climate disruption for water reform, healthy net zero energy buildings, ecologically balanced

3 infrastructure, Biomimicry, interdisciplinary integrated collaboration, sustainable behavior

4 education and Living Buildings & Living Communities. Ms. Rainier is also an advocate for

5 restorative, regenerative, resiliency planning and development that respects natural ecosystems,
6 diversity, addresses social equity. Petitioner's members also include Davis resident Colin

7 Walsh. Petitioner is suing on its behalf, and on behalf of others who will be affected in the

8 Davis area, as well as for all residents in the County of Yolo, including all those who seek to

9 maintain sensible planning in the land use entitlement process.

10 4. Respondent City of Davis ("City" a or "Respondent") is a municipal corporation,
11 organized under the law of the state of California, and exercising local government power. The

12 City is the CEQA "lead agency" for the Project. As lead agency for the Project, the City is
13 responsible for preparation of an environmental document that describes the Revised Project and
14 its impacts, and, if necessary evaluates mitigation measures and/or alternatives to lessen or avoid

15 any significant environmental impacts. The Revised Project is within the City's jurisdictional

16 limits.

17 5. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Nishi Gateway,
18 LLC, named as a real party in interest ("Real Party"), is a California limited liability company
19 operating in California, to which the City granted some or all of the Project approvals.
20 Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Real Party holds all project
21 approvals granted by the City in this case.

22 6. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names of respondents sued herein as Does
23 through 10, inclusive, and therefore sues them by those fictitious names. Petitioner will amend

24 the petition to alleged their true names and capacities if and when they are ascertained.
25 Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that each of these fictitiously-
26 named respondents is in some manner responsible for the wrongful conduct alleged in this
27 petition.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2 7. The Court has jurisdiction over this matter in accordance with Code of Civil
3 Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5

4 8. Venue is proper in Yolo County in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure

5 section 394, subdivision (a), among others, because the Revised Project is located in Yolo

6 County.

7 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

8 9. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to this filing and participated in
9 the administrative process. Petitioner and its members actively participated in the administrative
10 process leading up to the City's approval of the Revised Project, and stated their objections to
11 the City's actions. (See Pub. Resources Code, § 21177, subd. (b).)

12 10. Petitioner and its members objected to Respondent's approval of the Revised
13 Project in writing prior to the City's approval of the Revised Project and adoption of the EIR
14 Addendum.

15 11. The grounds for noncompliance alleged in this Petition were presented to the City
16 orally and in writing prior to the close of the City's public hearing on the subject.
17 12. Respondent has taken final agency actions with respect to adopting the NOD and
18 approving the Revised Project.

19 13. Petitioner possesses no other remedy than to challenge the City's abuse of
20 discretion other than by means of this lawsuit.
21 STANDING

22 14. Respondent has mandatory duties to comply with CEQA before approving the
23 Project.

24 15. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because members
25 of Davis Coalition for Sensible Planning are residents of the City of Davis and have personal,
26 community and environmental interests that are directly and adversely affected by the City's
27 approval of the Revised Project and issuance of the Notice of Determination (NOD"). As an
28 association composed of residents within the City, Petitioner is within the class of persons

SOLURI 4
MESERVE

CORPORATION FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

beneficially interested in, and aggrieved by, the acts of Respondent as alleged below. Petitioner

2 and its members participated in the administrative processes herein, and exhausted their
3 remedies. Accordingly, Petitioner has standing to sue.

4 16. Petitioner has a substantial interest in ensuring the Revised Project's impacts are
5 fully mitigated. Unless the relief requested herein is granted, Petitioner's environmental and

6 community interests will be adversely affected and injured by Respondent's failure to comply
7 with CEQA in approving the Revised Project.

8 17. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing this action, including
9 complying with the requirement of Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by providing notice

10 to the City that this action would be filed. (See Exhibit A attached.)
11 18. Petitioner will also a serve a copy of this petition on the California Attorney General
12 as required by law.

13 IRREPARABLE HARM

14 19. The City's failures, set forth in this Petition, constitute a prejudicial abuse of
15 discretion within the meaning of the Code of Civil Procedure and CEQA. (See Code Civ. Proc.,
16 §§ 1085, 1094.5; Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21168, 21168.5.)
17 20. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.
18 If the City's actions regarding the Revised Project are effectuated, Petitioner and the

19 environment will be irreparably harmed. No money damages could adequately compensate for
20 that harm.

21 REQUEST TO PREPARE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD

22 21. Pursuant to Public Resources Code, section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2), Petitioner
23 elects to prepare the administrative record in this action.

24 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

25 22. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that the Nishi
26 Property has been maintained as agricultural land since at least 1870.

CORPORATION FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 23. The Original Project proposed 1,920 "beds" in 650 multifamily residential units as

2 for-sale condominium units, 325,000 square feet of research and development or offices uses,
3 and up to 20,000 square feet of accessory retail uses.

4 24. In 2015, the City had an Environmental Impact Report ("Original EIR") prepared
5 for the Original Project.

6 25. The Original EIR determined that the Original Project would have resulted in

7 significant and unavoidable environmental impacts to Agriculture, Air Quality, Greenhouse Gas
8 Emissions, Noise, and Transportation.

9 26. The City certified the Original EIR on or about February 2016, and also approved
10 entitlements for the project including but not limited to a General Plan Amendment, Prezoning,
11 a Development Agreement, and a Determination to place the project on the ballot for voter
12 consideration under Measure R (Davis Municipal Code, §§ 41.01.010 et seq.).
13 27. Since the Original Project proposed to redesignate the Nishi Property from
14 Agriculture to a Mixed Use Innovation District land use designation, it required approval by an
15 affirmative majority vote of Davis voters under Measure R.

16 28. A majority of the Davis voters voted against the Original Project in June 2016,
17 which led to the entitlements being rescinded.

18 29. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on the basis alleges, that Real Party
19 revised the Original Project in 2017. The Revised Project omitted all 325,000 square feet of
20 research and development uses, increased the bed count associated with residential uses by
21 approximately 250, replaced the for-sale housing with rental units, and modified the site's
22 access such that primary access would be through a railroad undercrossing between UC Davis
23 and the Nishi Property.

24 The Revised Project's Environmental Impacts

25 30. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Real Party again
26 filed an application or applications that sought at least the following actions and approvals: (a)
27 an Addendum to the previously-certified EIR; (b) a General Plan Amendment redesignating the
28 Nishi Property from Agriculture to a Residential land use designation; (c) a Development

- Agreement; (d) Prezoning and Preliminary Planned Development; (d) a Determination to place

2 the project on the June 2018 ballot for voter consideration under Measure R; and (e) other
3 approvals (collectively "Entitlements").

4 31. In January 2018, the City released the EIR Addendum (SCH # 201512066) in

5 which it determined that the Original EIR adequately assessed the impacts of the Revised

6 Project and that there were no changed circumstances or new information that would require
7 preparation of a subsequent or supplemental EIR, or recirculation of the Original EIR.

8 32. Since the Original EIR was released, and prior to the release of the EIR
9 Addendum, new information became available and the circumstances surrounding the Revised
10 Project and under which the Revised Project would be implemented have changed, including but
11 not limited to:

12 a. New related projects have been proposed that have the potential to
13 significantly impact Agricultural Resources in Davis and the County of Yolo.

14 b. The addition of more residents to the Revised Project who would be
15 subjected to toxic air contaminants, diesel particulate matter, and ultrafine particulate matters in

16 levels that the Original EIR determined were significant.

17 C. New information related to the inadequacy of Air Quality mitigation
18 measures since they do not require the installation of windows that cannot open.

19 d. New information and changed circumstances with respect to Greenhouse
20 Gas Emissions, including but not limited to new California Supreme Court case law, new
21 statewide reductions targets imposed by the California Legislature, new statewide and regional
22 plans for achieving statewide targets, new natural disasters that impacts the state's ability to
23 achieve statewide targets, and new building code standards.

24 e. New information and changed circumstances with respect to the Revised
25 Project's land use mix, which drastically alter the project's compliance with applicable plans,
26 including the City's General Plan and regional plans.

27

28

MESERVE
ALAW FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE CORPORATION

1 f. New information and changed circumstances with respect to the Revised
2 Project's affordable housing proposal and the City's requirements on rental housing
3 development projects.

4 g. The addition of more residents to the Revised Project that would be

5 subjected to noise disturbances in levels that the Original EIR determined were significant.

6 h. New information and changed circumstances with respect to Transportation

7 and Circulation, as the Revised Project now includes only one public vehicular access through

8 UC Davis, and the university is not legally bound to provide that access.

9 i. New information and changed circumstances with respect to new proposed
10 development projects in Davis and Yolo County, which when considered in conjunction with
11 the Revised Project, have the potential to significantly impact all areas studied by the Original
12 EIR.

13 The Revised Project's Affordable Housing

14 33. Article 18.05 of the Davis Municipal Code provides the City's affordable housing
15 requirements (Davis Municipal Code, §§ 18.05.010-18.050-080, collectively "Existing
16 Affordable Ordinance").

17 34. Davis's Existing Affordable Ordinance provides that "General plan implementing
18 policies [ require that, to the extent feasible and subject to existing law, rental housing
19 developments . . . with twenty or more units [provide] twenty-five percent of the units be
20 affordable to low income households and ten percent of the units be affordable to very low
21 income households . . . in perpetuity." (Davis Municipal Code, § 18.05.010, subdivision (g); see
22 also Davis Municipal Code, § 18.05.060 [requiring the same "to the maximum extent
23 feasible"].)

24 35. The Existing Affordable Ordinance does not permit affordable-housing-eligibility
25 restrictions based on whether an applicant is a student.

26 36. Consistent with the Existing Affordable Ordinance, the City's General Plan
27 Housing Element describes the difficulties associated with extending affordable housing to
28 students, and suggests that the City should focus instead on encouraging affordable housing to

SOLURI 8
MESERVE
A LAW
CORPORATION FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

non-students. The relevant provision provides, "[It] is difficult to direct connect low and very-
2 low income student households to local affordable housing, based on State and Federal funding
3 requirements, development of low and very-low income units for other groups could decrease

4 competition of market rate apartment units and make rents more affordable for students."

5 (Housing Element, 3-81.)

6 37. Contrary to the City's General Plan direction, the Revised Project's affordable
7  housing is available only to students and excludes working families. This exclusion applies
8 even if eligible students fail to occupy all of the Revised Project's affordable housing. The
9 Revised Project's Development Agreement provides in relevant part, "In the event that
10 Developer fails to lease all of the Affordable Beds in any year, after diligent efforts, Developer
11 will pay the City of Davis' Housing Fund an amount equivalent to the difference between the
12 total annual market rent and the rent for the Affordable Bed for each bed that is not rented to an

13 Extremely Low or Very-Low Income student, as applicable for that year, and may lease those
14 beds at market rate."

15 38. The Revised Project also leases its affordable housing by the individual bed and
16 not by an entire dwelling unit. This leasing strategy is inconsistent with the Existing Affordable
17 Ordinance and also results in impermissibly increased housing costs to families of two or more
18 persons, and in particular families with children.

19 39. The Revised Project's affordable housing leasing strategy imposes additional
20 burdens on families with minor children. For example, a single parent with a minor child in one
21 of the Revised Project's affordable housing units would be required to share their dwelling unit
22 with another adult who is not a member of that same family.
23 40. The first sentence of Davis Municipal Code section 18.05.060, subdivision (e),
24 provides that the "City acknowledges that the published appellate case of Palmer/Sixth Street
25 Properties, L.P. v. City of Los Angeles (2nd Dist. 2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1396 holds that the
26 Costa-Hawkins Act (Civ. Code, § 1954.50 et seq.) precludes local governments from requiring a
27 developer to set affordable rent levels for private rental housing unless the developer has agreed
28

SOLURI 9
MESERVE
A LAW
CORPORATION FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

to such rental restrictions in exchange for financial assistance or other consideration from the

2 local government."

3 41. However, the second sentence of Davis Municipal Code section 18.05.060,
4 subdivision (e), provides that "[t]his section shall be operative at such time that the Palmer case

5 is overturned, disapproved or depublished by a court of competent jurisdiction, or the state

6 legislature amends state law to authorize local governments to require the development and
7 restriction of affordable rental units in the manner set forth in this section."

8 42. On September 29, 2017, Assembly Bill 1505 "AB 1505") was signed into law,
9 and legislatively authorized local governments to require affordable housing units in new rental
10 housing developments, overturning the Palmer decision, with a January 1, 2018 effective date.
11 43. Therefore, beginning on January 1, 2018, the first sentence of Davis Municipal
12 Code section 18.05.060, subdivision (e), became inapplicable, and all provisions relating to
13 rental housing in the Existing Housing Ordinance became binding on "developer[s] of rental
14 housing developments."

15 44. Therefore, all provisions relating to rental housing in the Existing Affordable
16 Ordinance were operative and binding when the City Council considered and approved the
17 Revised Project on February 6, 2018.

18 45. The Revised Project did not propose affordable housing consistent with the
19 requirements of the Existing Affordable Ordinance. When the City Council approved the
20 Revised Project, it did not require compliance with the Existing Affordable Ordinance.
21 46. The Revised Project also restricted the proposed affordable housing to students
22 only. The City Council approved this restriction.

23 47. Therefore, as approved, the Revised Project violates the Existing Affordable
24 Ordinance, and the City Council violated it when both approving the project and referring the
25 Revised Project to the voters in the June 2018 "Measure R" election.

26 48. Although the Davis City Council considered an ordinance to amend Davis
27 Municipal Code section 18.050.060 (*Amended Affordable Ordinance") on February 6, 2018,
28

SOLURI 10
MESERVE
A LAW
CORPORATION FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 the Amended Affordable Ordinance did not have an effective date of and did not become

2 effective on February 6, 2018.

3 49. Accordingly, the Revised Project violated the affordable housing requirements of
4 the Davis Municipal Code, and the City has failed to proceed in accordance with law.

S 50. On January 24, 2018, the City's Planning Commission held a hearing to consider

6 the Revised Project, and voted to recommend the City Council approve the Entitlements
7 requested by Real Party.

8 51. On February 6, 2018, the City Council held a hearing to consider the Revised
9 Project, voted to approve the Entitlements, and acted to place the project on the June 2018 ballot
10 for voter consideration under Measure R.

11 52. On or about February 7, 2018, the City filed a notice of determination stating that
12 on February 6, 2018, the City approved the Revised Project.
13 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

14 (Violation of CEQA: Failure to Prepare Supplemental or Subsequent EIR)
15 53. Petitioner incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 52 above.
16 54. Public Resources Code section 21166 and CEQA Guidelines section 15162
17 provide that a supplemental or subsequent EIR must be prepared where: (i) the revised project
18 will create new significant impacts on the environment that were not previously identified, (ii)
19 the revised project will create a substantial increase in the severity of a previously identified
20 significant impact, or (iii) there is new information of substantial importance that was not
21 previously available, which shows a new significant impact, substantial increase in the severity
22 of previously identified significant impact, or mitigation measures that were not considered
23 would substantially reduce one or more significant effects on the environment.

24 55. A lead agency's findings that a supplemental or subsequent EIR is unnecessary
25 must be supported by substantial evidence in the record.

26 56. The City's action in approving the EIR Addendum constitutes a prejudicial abuse
27 of discretion in that the City failed to proceed in the manner required by law and failed to
28 support its decision with substantial evidence. Among other things, the City:

SOLURI 11
MESERVE
A LAW
CORPORATION FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

a. Failed adequately to disclose, analyze, mitigate, and avoid the new

2 potentially significant impacts on Land Use and Planning and Transportation and Circulation,

3 which are a direct result of the changes made to the Revised Project.

4 b. Failed adequately to disclose, analyze, mitigate, and avoid substantial

5 increases in the severity of previously identified significant impacts on Agriculture, Air Quality,

6 Greenhouse Gas Emissions, and Noise, which are a direct result of the changes made to the
7 Revised Project.

8 C. Failed adequately to disclose, analyze, mitigate, and avoid new and
9 substantial increases in the severity of significant cumulative impacts on all areas based on new
10 information that was not previously available.

11 d. Failed adequately to disclose and analyze new mitigation measures that
12 were not considered that would substantially reduce the severity of one or more significant
13 effects on the environment, including mitigation measures with respect to Air Quality.
14 e. Failed to prepare and circulate a supplemental or subsequent EIR when
15 required under Public Resources Code section 21166 and CEQA Guidelines section 15162,

16 which among other things deprived Petitioner and other interested individuals of their

17 opportunity to participate in formal public review and comment in accordance with CEQA

18 Guidelines sections 15162, subdivision (d) and 15163, subdivision (c).
19 57. The City further violated CEQA by adopting findings that are inadequate as a
20 matter of law because they do not contain the findings required when approving a project based
21 on a supplemental or subsequent EIR, and because they are not supported by substantial
22 evidence in the record.

23 58. As a result of the foregoing defects, the City prejudicially abused its discretion by
24 proceeding with an EIR Addendum and approving the Revised Project in reliance thereon.
25 Accordingly, the City's determination that an EIR Addendum was appropriate, and approval of
26 the Revised Project and all Revised Project approvals and Entitlements, which rely on the
27 defective EIR Addendum, must be set aside.

28

SOLURI 12

CORPORATION FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

59. Petitioner and other members of the general public will be irreparably harmed if
2 the relief requested herein is not granted and the Revised Project begins construction in the
3 absence of a supplemental or subsequent EIR and absent compliance with all other applicable
4 provisions of CEQA and other laws.

5 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

6 (Violation of Planning and Zoning Laws: General Plan Amendment and Consistency)
7 60. Petitioner incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 59 above.

8 61. The City's General Plan is the constitution for all future development, and any
9 decision affecting land use and development must be consistent with it.

10 62. Actions inconsistent with the General Plan are void ab initio.

11 63. The City prepared a General Plan consistency analysis for the Original Project
12 based on the project's then-proposed uses and project description.
13 64. Real Party made substantial revisions to the Original Project such that the Revised
14 Project, for instance, omitted 325,000 square feet of research and developments uses, which
15 drastically revised the project's land uses.

16 65. Real Party requested for the Revised Project a General Plan Amendment and other
17 entitlements and approvals that depend on General Plan consistency.
18 66. The City did not adequately update its General Plan consistency analysis for the
19 Revised Project.

20 67. The City approved the General Plan Amendment and other entitlements and
21 approvals that depend on General Plan consistency.

22 68. By approving the Revised Project's General Plan Amendment and other
23 entitlements and approvals that depend on General Plan consistency without an updated and
