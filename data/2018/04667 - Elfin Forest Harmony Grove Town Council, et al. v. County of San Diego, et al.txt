28 Notice to Attorney General

1 TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA:

2 PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 21167.7, that on
3 August 24, 2018, Petitioners, ELFIN FOREST HARMONY GROVE TOWN COUNCIL,
4 CLEVELAND NATIONAL FOREST FOUNDATION, and ENDANGERED HABITATS
5 LEAGUE, filed a Verified Petition for Peremptory Writ of Mandate pursuant to the California

6 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") challenging the approval by the COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO
(the County") of the Valiano Specific Plan Project ("the Project"), which proposes the

8 construction of up to 380 residential units on roughly 240 vacant acres in the unincorporated area

9 of Eden Valley/Harmony Grove in the County of San Diego.

10 Under the County of San Diego General Plan ("General Plan"), the Project site would be

11 limited to 118 units. The Project received a General Plan Amendment to allow the Project to build

12 more than triple the number of allowable units (approximately 380 units) as well as to remove

13 roughly 40 acres of the Project site from the boundaries of the Elfin Forest Harmony Grove

14 Community Subarea Plan, which is a component of the General Plan. As a result, the Project is no is

15 longer subject to the Subarea Plan's minimum lot size requirement of two acres, among other

16 requirements that are intended to preserve the rural character and nature of the planning area. Yet,
the Project continues to conflict with numerous General Plan policies, particularly those related to
17 reductions of greenhouse gas emissions ("GHGs") and fire safety, as alleged in the Petition.
18 The County failed to comply with CEQA in certifying an Environmental Impact Report
19 ("EIR") for the Project. Among other deficiencies, the EIR ignores the cumulative impacts
20 associated with approving the Valiano Project together with numerous other residential projects,
21 including the nearby Harmony Grove Village South Project. The County has approved, or is in the
22 process of approving, numerous General Plan Amendments to allow similar residential projects in
23 rural or semi-rural areas to exceed allowable densities as permitted under the General Plan. The
24 EIR for the Valiano Project fails to evaluate and mitigate the cumulative effects of this
25 development in terms of inter alia land use and GHG impacts. For these and the other reasons
26 alleged in the Verified Petition for Peremptory Writ of Mandate (transmitted herewith), the
27| decisions approving the Project and certifying the Project's EIR must be overturned.

INTRODUCTION
26

27 1. This action challenges the approval by the County of San Diego of the Valiano

28 Specific Plan project ("the Project") to include the certification of a Final

-] -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") pursuant to the California Environmental

2 Quality Act ("CEQA") as a well as a General Plan Amendment to allow a dense
residential project in an area designated by the General Plan for semi-rural

4 development. The Project presents a host of adverse, unmitigated environmental

5 impacts, including serious risks to public safety as a result of fire evacuation issues.

6 The Project - a suburban housing development - also conflicts with numerous

7 policies of the General Plan aimed at preserving semi-rural lands as well as

8 undermines the ability of the County to maintain consistency with the General Plan
9 in terms of sustainable growth. Accordingly, Petitioners, Elfin Forest Harmony

10 Grove Town Council, Cleveland National Forest Foundation, and Endangered
11 Habitats League ("Petitioners") respectfully request issuance of a peremptory writ
12 of mandate setting aside the decisions of Respondent, County of San Diego

13 ("County"), made on or about July 25, 2018, approving the Project.
14 2. The Project involves the construction of up to approximately 380 housing units on
15 239 acres of natural lands in the unincorporated area of Eden Valley and Harmony
16 Grove in the County of San Diego. The County certified an EIR for the Project

17 finding that impacts were significant and unmitigable in the areas of air quality
18 (conflict with air quality plans), transportation (conflict with transportation plans)

19 and aesthetics (short-term). These significant impacts are largely due to the fact the

20 Project proposes a vastly denser development than envisioned by applicable
21 regional planning documents. The County's approval of the EIR was in error and

22 fails to comply with CEQA; notably, the County failed to comply with CEQA's
23 "substantive mandate" to adopt all feasible mitigation and project alternatives prior
24 to approving a project with significant impacts.

25 3. The County's 2011 General Plan would have limited the Project site to 40

26 residential units. A subsequent amendment in January 2012 as part of the Property
27 Specific Requests increased this to 118 residential units. The Project includes a

28

-2-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

General Plan Amendment to allow the applicant to further triple this density by

2 developing up to 380 units as well as to remove 44 acres of the "project site" from

3 the boundaries of the Elfin Forest Harmony Grove Community Subarea Plan

4 ("EFHGSP"), which is a component of the County's General Plan. The purpose of

5 removing this acreage is to allow the Project to avoid the strict requirements of the

6 EFHGSP including related to minimum lot sizes. However, even with the General

7 Plan Amendment, there are still conflicts between the Project and numerous other

8 policies of the General Plan including those related to concentrating growth in

9 urban areas and discouraging growth in rural and semi-rural areas. As a result of

10 the numerous conflicts between the Project and the General Plan, the County's

11 approval of the a Project is a prejudicial abuse of discretion, is not supported by

12 substantial evidence, or otherwise fails to comply with the law.
13 4. Finally, the Valiano Project was approved at the same hearing as two other housing

14 development projects - Harmony Grove Village South ("HGVS") and Otay 250. The
15 County in fact "bundled" the three projects as part of the same General Plan

16 Amendment. Approving three General Plan Amendments to allow vastly greater

17 building densities in areas not designated for such growth creates internal

18 inconsistencies and conflicts with policies of the General Plan. Petitioners thus seek

19 a declaration that the County's approval of the GPAs creates an internal

20 inconsistency in the General Plan, is an abuse of discretion, or otherwise fails to
21 comply with the law.

22 5. By this verified petition and complaint, Petitioners allege the following:

23 PARTIES

24 6. Petitioner, Elfin Forest Harmony Grove Town Council ("EFHGTC"), is a 501(c)(3)

25 non-profit corporation that provides a forum for residents in the Elfin Forest and
26 Harmony Grove communities to address local issues; acts to maintain the area's
27 rural characteristics, and; represents the community in discussions with outside

28

-3-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- interests. The Town Council participated extensively in the administrative process

2 leading up to the County's adoption of its 2011 General Plan, and thus has a

3 significant stake in ensuring the County follows through on the commitments it
4 made there. Members of the Town Council also live, work, and recreate in the

5 vicinity of the proposed Project, and thus will be impacted by the increased

6 traffic, wildfire risk, and other environmental impacts of the Project.

7 7. Petitioner Endangered Habitats League ("EHL") is a tax-exempt non-profit

8 California corporation dedicated to the conservation of native ecosystems and to

9 sustainable land use and transportation planning. Since 1991, EHL has engaged in
10 planning partnerships across Southern California and worked to create habitat

11 preserve systems, now threatened by climate change. EHL is extremely active in the
12 San Diego region, where many of its members live and enjoy the biological
13 diversity in the area, and served on the County advisory committee for the 2011

14 General Plan Update. EHL submitted written comments to the County objecting to
15 and commenting on the Project and EIR.

16 8. Petitioner Cleveland National Forest Foundation ("CNFF") is a nonprofit
17 corporation dedicated to preserving the plants, animals, and other natural resources
18 of Southern California mountains by protecting the land and water they need to
19 survive. CNFF is committed to sustainable regional land use planning in San Diego
20 County in order to stem the tide of urban encroachment on wildlands. Members of
21 CNFF are residents and taxpayers of San Diego County.
22 9. Respondent County of San Diego ("the County") is a political subdivision of the
23 State of California. The County is a local governmental agency charged with the
24 authority of regulating and administering local land use and development within its
25 territory in compliance with the provisions of its general plan and zoning ordinances
26 as well as applicable provisions of State law, including CEQA. The County is the
27

28

lead agency for the Project and is therefore charged with the duty of ensuring
compliance with applicable laws.

3 10. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Real Party in Interest,

4 Integral Communities, LLC, is identified as the applicant for the Project, has an

5 ownership interest in the property, and/or claims an interest in the Project approvals

6 at the subject of this lawsuit.

7 11. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Real Party in Interest,

8 The Eden Hills Project Owner, LLC, is an applicant for the Project, has an

9 ownership interest in the property and/or claims an interest in the Project approvals
10 at the subject of this lawsuit.

11 12. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Real Party In Interest,
12 RCS - Harmony Partners, LLC, is the applicant for the Harmony Grove Village
13 South project and therefore has an interest in the General Plan Amendment ("GPA")
14 at the subject of this lawsuit.
15 13. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Real Party In Interest,
16 Sunroad Nevada Enterprises, Inc., is the applicant for the Otay 250 project and

17 therefore claims an interest in the GPA at the subject of this lawsuit.
18 14. DOES 1 through 100 are individuals or entities that may have an ownership interest
19 in the property, are project applicants, or claim an interest in the approvals at the
20 subject of this lawsuit. Petitioners are unaware of the true names or capacities of the
21 Real Parties in Interest identified herein under the fictitious names DOES 1 through

22 100 inclusive.

23 STATEMENT OF FACTS

24 The Proiect

25 15. The Valiano Specific Plan Project is described as a plan for the development of
26 approximately 239 acres in the unincorporated area of Eden Valley/Harmony Grove
27 in the County of San Diego. The Project divides the site into five residential

28

-5-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 planning areas ("Neighborhoods") and will involve a total of 326 units: 273 single
2 family homes and 53 detached condominium units. The Project also includes
approximately 54 "secondary" or "accessory dwelling units."
4 16. The Project site is located two miles west of Interstate 15, 1.5 miles south of State
5 Route 78, east and south of the City of San Marcos, and one-quarter mile west of
6 the City of Escondido.

7 17. The site is mostly undeveloped with vegetation and natural terrain. The topography
8 consists of steeper slopes in northern areas. Some remnant structures remain on the
9 property from prior agricultural and equestrian uses. The agricultural operations
10 were abandoned on the site after the 2014 Cocos Fire.

11 18. Surrounding uses include low density, large lot homes in San Marcos to the west,
12 low density homes, a vineyard and tasting room, and several equestrian ranches,
13 including a large breeding and training facility to the east, and open space to the
14 south. Further south is the Harmony Grove Village housing development.
15 19. The Project proposes that vehicular access shall be provided at Eden Valley Lane,
16 Mount Whitney Road, and two future access driveways south of Mount Whitney
17 Road, all connecting to County Club Drive, resulting in Country Club Drive being
18 the only ingress and egress to the Project site. The Project includes improvements
19 to Hill Valley Drive, Eden Valley Lane and Mount Whitney Road to County
20 standards for "Private Roads".
21 20. The Project includes the installation of a new water main located on Eden Valley
22 Lane. Because the Project site is currently served by individual on-site septic
23 systems, a Major Use Permit was approved for an on-site wastewater treatment
24 facility to provide wastewater service for the Project. The Project will require
25 annexation into a sewer district to obtain sewer service. The wastewater treatment
26 plant will be located in the southern portion of the Project site in Neighborhood 5.
27 21. A portion of Neighborhood 5 will need to be detached from the County Service
28

-6-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Area ("CSA") No. 107 and annexed into the San Marcos Fire Protection District
2 ("SMFPD") for fire service. The Project relies upon SMFPD fire station #3 as well
cO as the future fire station within the Harmony Grove Village development to the
4 south for fire service. Despite these claims, the record indicates that presently there
1A is not adequate fire service to meet the General Plan mandated minimum fire

response time of five minutes.

7 22. The 2011 County of San Diego General Plan designates the site as Semi-Rural 1

8 ("SR1") that allows 1 unit per 1, 2, or 4 acres depending on the slope, and Semi-
9 Rural 2 ("SR2") that allows 1 unit per 2, 4 or 8 acres. In 2011, in connection with
10 the County's approval of the new General Plan, the owners of the Project site
11 requested that the Land Use Designations of the site be amended to Village
12 Residential 2 ("VR2") to allow 2 units per acre. The County declined to make this
13 change, and instead the new General Plan retained the SR1 and SR2 land use

14 designations. However, in June 2012, density was increased on one parcel to yield
15 the current 118 units.

16 23. Under the current General Plan land use designations, including the density increase
17 granted in 2012, a maximum of 118 units is allowed. The Project applicant
18 requested a General Plan Amendment to allow for increased density, specifically
19 changing the site's current land use designations from SR1 and SR2 to Semi-Rural

20 0.5 (1 unit per 0.5, or 2 acres).
21 24. The entire Project site is located within the San Dieguito Community Plan Area
22 ("SDCP"), which is a component of the County of San Diego General Plan. The
23 SDCP focuses intense land uses within the "Village Boundary". The Project site

map. The 24 lies outside the "Village Boundary" as shown on the SDCP land use

25 SDCP states that it anticipates that future growth will be balanced so that areas

26 outside the Village Boundary "keep its rural voice." It further states that "[a]s
27 population increases in San Diego County and statewide, there will be continual
28

-7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

I pressure to put higher density residential into or adjacent to Elfin Forest. However,

2 given the challenges facing this community, this should not be allowed to occur."

3 (emphasis added)

4 25.A portion of the Project site the approximately 44 acres comprising

5 "Neighborhood 5" - is also located within the Elfin Forest Harmony Grove Subarea

6 Plan ("EFHGSP"), a subarea plan within the San Dieguito Community Plan Area.

7 The EFHGSP was adopted in 2011 after years of planning and numerous

8 community meetings; and it was later amended in 2014. The EFHGSP directs and
9 balances land uses within the rural and semi-rural communities of Elfin Forest and

10 Harmony Grove. The EFHGSP describes that the Elfin Forest community "has

11 extremely strong community spirit that focuses on the preservation of Elfin Forest as
12 a rural community." The EFHGSP describes that Elfin Forest is situated in two
13 intersecting valleys - one running north-south and the other running east-west.
14 These valleys are isolated by the topography of the surrounding hills and are rural in

15 character. The valleys are also home to a diverse mix of native plants and animals,
16 and the area is "high value habitat" according to regional habitat plans. According
17 to the EFHGSP, the character of the Elfin Forest community "is based on openness:

18 open land, open spaces, and undeveloped countryside with a low density of homes.
19 Most homes are well integrated into the natural landscape. The Elfin Forest

20 community encompasses approximately 4,721.1 acres that are developed with
21 custom single-family homes on large estate lots. The homes must be located on lots

22 no smaller than two acres and must utilize septic systems for sewage management."

23 The EFHGSP notes that "development of vacant parcels by any standard less than

24 two acres per dwelling unit poses the threat of subdivisions coming into our rural

25 community which would be inappropriate." The EFHGSP has policies and
26 requirements that direct and regulate development of the subject planning areas,
27 including Policy LU-1.1.2 requiring minimum lot sizes of two acres, Policy LU-

28

-8-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1.1.3 requiring septic systems for any and all development, and Policy LU-1.1.6

2 prohibiting sidewalks.

3 26. The Project, as intentionally designed, does not conform to the specific

4 development policies of the EFHGSP relative to lot size, septic systems or

5 sidewalks. Prior to the release of the RDEIR, the applicant revised the Project

6 application to include a request for a General Plan Amendment to remove the area

7 of "Neighborhood 5" from the EFHGSP so that the entire site will be located

8 outside of the EFHGSP. The County and the applicant assert that this amendment
9 removes any land inconsistency between the Project and surrounding uses or

10 policies and requirements of the relevant planning documents.

11 27. The current zoning of the Project site is A70 Limited Agriculture. The Project

12 proposes a zoning amendment to change the zoning to S88 (Specific Plan Area).
13 28. The Project includes the following land use approvals:
14 a) General Plan Amendment (GPA-13-001) to change the land use

15 designation to allow greater densities than permitted under the current

16 General Plan land use designations as well as to remove "Neighborhood
17 5" from the EFGHSP;

18 b) Specific Plan (SP-13-001) to establish the guidelines and regulations that
19 will govern the development of the Specific Plan area, thus establishing

20 the zoning that will govern the Project site;
21 c) Zone Reclassification (REZ-13-001);

22 d) Vesting Tentative Map (TM 5575);
23 e) Site Plan (STP-13-003); and

24 f) Major Use Permit (MUP-14-019) relating to the construction of the
25 wastewater treatment plant.

26 CEQA Review and Project Approval

27 29. The County distributed Notice of Preparation ("NOP") of Environmental Impact

28

-9-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Report on June 20, 2013 for a 30-day review and comment period.

2 30. On April 30, 2015, the County prepared a Draft Environmental Impact Report
3 ("DEIR") and released a Notice of Availability ("NOA") of DEIR with a comment a
4 period ending on June 15, 2015.

5 31.On December 8, 2016, the County released an NOA for a Recirculated Draft

6 Environmental Impact Report ("RDEIR") with a comment period ending on January

7 30, 2017. The NOA describes that the County revised the DEIR in the areas of

8 greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) and land use. With respect to GHGs, the RDEIR
9 substantially modified the GHG threshold of significance and supporting analysis,
10 but, like the DEIR, it concludes that impacts are less-than-significant and no
11 mitigation is required.

12 32. The County received a total of 176 comment letters on the DEIR and RDEIR during
13 the public comment periods.

14 33. The Project's Final EIR was prepared in or about February 2018. With respect to
15 GHGs, the Final EIR includes entirely new analysis pursuant to a different
16 methodology, and it concludes that impacts are less-than-significant with mitigation.
17 34. The EIR concludes that the Project will result in significant and unavoidable
18 impacts in the areas of direct and cumulative air quality impacts,
19 transportation/traffic, and short-term aesthetics. In all other areas, the EIR claims
20 that impacts are less-than-significant, or less-than-significant with mitigation
21 imposed.

22 35.On February 8, 2018, the San Dieguito Community Planning Group ("SDCPG")
23 considered and recommended denial of the Project by a vote of 11-0-0-2. The noted
24 issues of concern include the Project's removal of Neighborhood 5 from the
25 EFHGSP, emergency evacuation, high fire hazards, loss of community character,
26 significant greenhouse gas emissions, and cumulative growth.
27 36. On May 11, 2018, the County's Planning Commission held a public hearing on the
28

-10-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Project, and despite significant community opposition, voted to recommend

2 approval of the Project to the County of San Diego Board of Supervisors by a vote
3 of 6-1-0-0.

4 37.On or about July 18, 2018, the County Board of Supervisors published an agenda
5 regarding a public hearing on the Project. The Agenda describes that the County

6 will hold a public hearing on July 25, 2018 to consider General Plan Amendment
7 ("GPA") 18-003 that includes three sub-items: "Item A-Harmony Grove Village

8 South; Item B-Valiano; and Item C-Otay 250." Hence the County noticed that
9 it was "bundling" three major land use amendments under the auspices of a single

10 GPA. The Project had not previously been described as a "bundled" activity.
11 38. On July 25, 2018, the Board of Supervisors held a public hearing on the Project
12 including the "bundled" GPA. Numerous persons testified as to the Valiano
13 Project's adverse environmental effects, though many had to leave after having sat

14 through the two other projects on the Agenda, and they urged the County to deny

15 the Project approvals. Despite these comments, the Board of Supervisors voted to

16 certify the EIR; voted to adopt Findings of Fact, a Mitigation, Monitoring and

17 Reporting Program ("MMRP"), and a Statement of Overriding Considerations; and
18 voted to approve the other land use approvals including the "bundled" GPA.
19 39. On July 26, 2018, the County posted the CEQA Notice of Determination ("NOD")

20 for the Project.
21 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

22 40. This Court has jurisdiction to issue writs of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure

23 Section 1094.5 and declaratory relief under Section 1060.

24 41. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to CCP Sections 393 and 394 as the Project
25 is located in the County of San Diego; the relevant Board of Supervisors actions
26 were taken at the County Administration Building located in zip code 92101, where

27 the County does business; and the Project includes the GPA, a County-wide action.

28 42. The County's approval of the Project will cause Petitioners irreparable injury

-11-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 for which Petitioners have no adequate remedy at law. Petitioners and their
2 members will be irreparably harmed by the County's actions in approving the
c Project. Petitioners were harmed by, among other things, the failure of the County
4 in its certification of the EIR to adequately evaluate the potential impacts of the
a u Project, and the County's approval of the Project without providing adequate and
effective mitigation measures contrary to the requirements of State law.
43. The maintenance of this action is for the purpose of enforcing important public

8 policies of the State of California with respect to the protection of the environment
9 under CEQA and conformance with state law and local law. The maintenance and

10 prosecution of this action will confer a substantial benefit upon the public by
11 protecting the public from environmental and other harms alleged in this Petition.
12 Petitioners are acting as private attorneys general to enforce these public policies
13 and prevent such harm.
14 44. Petitioners have performed all conditions precedent to filing the action by
15 complying with the requirements of Public Resources Code § 21167.5, in notifying
16 Respondent of the filing of this action (attached hereto as Exhibit "A"), and by
17 complying with the requirements of Public Resources Code § 21167.6, in notifying
18 Respondent of Petitioners' election to prepare the record of Respondent's
19 proceedings in connection with this action (attached hereto as Exhibit "B").

20 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

21 45. During the Project's administrative review process, Petitioners commented to the

22 County that the Project would result in potentially significant impacts to/from
23 including, but not limited to: aesthetics, air quality, biological resources, greenhouse
24 gases, public safety, traffic, cumulative and growth-inducing impacts. Petitioners
25 commented that the EIR was legally inadequate; that further mitigation was

26 required; and that project alternatives were feasible. Petitioners commented that the
27

28

-12-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

proposed GPA was inconsistent with the General Plan, and asked that the County
give further consideration to the cumulative effects of the "bundling" of GPAs.
t A 46. As a result of these comments in the record, Petitioners fully exhausted their
administrative remedies within the meaning of Public Resources Code, § 21177.
u FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

6 (Writ of Mandate - Violation of CEQA)
7

8 47. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate paragraphs 1 through 46 above as
though set forth in full herein.

10 48. The Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") is considered the "heart" of CEQA.

11 (State CEQA Guidelines, § 15003 (a).) The EIR's purpose is "not to generate paper

12 but to compel government at all levels to make decisions with environmental

13 consequences in mind." (State CEQA Guidelines § 15003 (g).) In furtherance of

14 this purpose, CEQA mandates that the EIR inform governmental decisionmakers

15 and the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of proposed

16 projects; identify the ways that environmental damage can be avoided or

17 significantly reduced; and prevent significant, avoidable damage to the environment

18 by requiring changes in projects through the use of alternatives or mitigation

19 measures when the agency finds the changes to be feasible. (State CEQA

20 Guidelines, § 15002.) In fact, CEQA dictates that the lead agency may not approve

21 a project with significant impacts where feasible mitigation measures and

22 alternatives exist. (Public Resources Code, § 21002.)

23 49. CEQA prescribes that an EIR must provide a project description and that the project

24 description must be accurate and complete. (State CEQA Guidelines, § 15124;

25 County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185.) Petitioners and

26 others commented that the EIR's Project Description was misleading and faulty.

27 For example, Petitioners commented that the Project is described as the

28 development of 326 residential units, when in reality, an additional 54 units are

-13-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 permitted as "secondary" units, meaning that the Project permits up to 380

3 residential units. By way of further example, the County failed to accurately

4 describe the proposed activity where the totality of "the Project" includes the major

5 land use density changes relative to the bundled GPA. There are potentially

6 significant impacts that result from allowing numerous projects to develop at much

7 greater densities than allowed by the General Plan in terms of, e.g., General Plan

8 GHG reduction targets, transportation issues, biology, ability to evacuate in a large

9 wildfire, and affordable housing. By failing to accurately describe the totality of the

10 Project in terms of the cumulative land use changes, the EIR minimizes the
Project's full impacts.

11

12 50. CEQA provides that an EIR must evaluate all potentially significant environmental

13 impacts of a proposed project including both direct and indirect impacts as well as

14 cumulative impacts. (State CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15126, 15126.2 (a), 15130.)

15 Petitioners and others commented that the EIR fails to adequately disclose, and

16 conclusions are not based on substantial evidence, with respect to impacts to/from

17 including, but not limited to, aesthetics, air quality, biology and habitats, greenhouse

18 gas emissions, hazards, land use, noise, public safety, traffic, cumulative and

19 growth-inducing impacts. By way of example, Petitioners and others commented,

that:

20

21 a) The EIR is not supported by substantial evidence to the extent the EIR

22 concludes that land use impacts are less-than-significant. The County's 2011

23 General Plan, including the San Dieguito Community Plan ("SDCP") and

24 Elfin Forest Harmony Grove Subarea Area Plan ("EFHGSAP"), establishes a

25 commitment to the continuation of rural and semi-rural communities where

26 those designations exist in the General Plan. The Project conflicts with

27 General Plan objectives related to the continuation of rural and semi-rural

28 land uses, and there are significant impacts that result from inconsistency

-14-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

between the Project and surrounding rural residential uses. Further, there are

2 numerous conflicts between the Project and specific General Plan policies
including, but not limited to: Policies LU-3.2, LU-5.3, LU-13.2, LU-14.4, H-
4 1.9, H-2.1, COS-11.1, COS-11.3, COS-12.1, COS-13.1, COS-14.1, COS-

5 14.5, COS-15.1, COS-15.4, ME-8.1, N-1.3, S-3.6, S-6.3, S-6.4, and S-6.5.

6 The EIR either does not evaluate consistency with these policies, or it does

7 not demonstrate the Project's conformance with these policies based on

8 substantial evidence in the record.
9 b) The EIR fails to adequately describe and evaluate that fact that the GPA was
10 approved to allow more residential units in the semi-rural Project area that
11 were not planned for in the General Plan, including the Harmony Grove
12 Village South (HGVS) project. The EIR fails to adequately disclose and
13 evaluate the effects of this cumulative development in terms of land use and

14 other impacts. Moreover, the EIR fails to disclose and evaluate the

15 combined effects, either in terms of consistency with the policies of the

16 General Plan or impacts on the environment, with respect to a number of
17 GPAs that have been approved or are currently being processed by the

18 County. The vast majority of these projects require a redesignation of land

19 from either Rural or Semi-Rural to Village land use designations under the

20 General Plan. The EIR does not evaluate the cumulative impact of the
21 Valiano project in addition to this cumulative development either in terms of
22 environmental impacts or General Plan consistency.
23 c) The EIR's conclusion of less-than-significant growth-inducing impacts is not
24 supported by substantial evidence. An EIR must evaluate any significant

25 environmental effects the project might cause by bringing development and
26 people into the area affected. (State CEQA Guidelines § 15126.2 (subd. (a).)
27 An EIR must specifically discuss "growth inducing impacts." (Guidelines §
28

-15-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1

2 15126.2 (d).) Growth-inducing impacts may occur, for instance, when a

3 project removes an obstacle for growth. "The major expansion of a waste

4 water treatment plant, might, for example, allow for more construction in

5 service areas." (Guidelines 15126.2 (d).) The Project will include the

• construction of a new wastewater treatment; this brings new services to the

7 area and removes obstacles for future growth. The Project also proposes the

8 widening and improvements of existing roadways, some of which are

9 currently dirt roads. The Project's population and housing numbers have not

10 been accounted for in regional projections, and, therefore, the Project's

11 population and housing are not consistent with the growth projected for the

12 area. Consequently, the Project is not "growth-accommodating" as claimed.

13 The Project also creates the potential for negative "precedent-setting" insofar

14 as it proposes an amendment to the General Plan to accommodate the higher

15 densities, and the removal of community plan boundaries to avoid

16 compliance with plan policies; future projects may follow suit in seeking

17 similar amendments. Finally, this Project represents a development pressure

18 on surrounding agricultural uses and large lots to convert to high density
residential.

19

20 d) The EIR's conclusion of less-than-significant impacts due to wildland fires is

21 not supported and the Project presents significant public safety risks related

22 to fire evacuation both on project-specific and cumulative bases. As

23 Petitioners and others repeatedly commented in the record, the EIR fails to

24 adequately evaluate and mitigate evacuation risk/hazards to the surrounding

25 rural community in the event of a wildland fire. In the Coco's fire in 2014,

26 which burned over 90% of the Project footprint, current residents of Eden

27 Valley and Harmony Grove had difficulties evacuating because of congested

28 road conditions. There is only one narrow two-lane road (Country Club

-16-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

2 Drive) to exit the community. Residents commented during the Project's

J administrative review process that fire evacuation problems can be expected

4 to increase with the Project. The Project's Fire Protection Plan (FPP) fails to
fully evaluate and mitigate the impact of adding density in a valley prone to

6 devastating fires without improving the road infrastructure to accommodate

7 the higher number of evacuating vehicles. Further, the Project improperly

8 relies on the future construction of a fire station within the nearby Harmony
Grove project (Mitigation Measure HZ-3). This is inadequate where the

10 County's General Plan requires that all projects meet service response times,

11 and where the EIR does not demonstrate based on substantial evidence that

12 the Project will satisfy the 5-minute service response time applicable to the
Project site.

13 e)

14 The EIR fails to demonstrate based on substantial evidence that the Project

15 has fully evaluated and mitigated the Project's Greenhouse Gas emissions

16 ("GHGs"). The Project represents a new source of GHG emissions, with the

17 majority of emissions being attributable to mobile sources. As mitigation for

18 the potentially significant impact, the Project relies on the purchase of

19 "carbon credits" However, the EIR fails to demonstrate based on

20 substantial evidence that the purchase of carbon credits allows the County to

21 achieve the emission reduction targets set forth in the County's new Climate

22 Action Plan (CAP) adopted in February 2018. First, the "carbon credits" are

23 ill-defined and not shown to be related to reducing emissions in the County,

24 which is the sole purpose of the County's CAP. The applicant is permitted

25 under the Project's mitigation program to purchase carbon offsets from an

26 unspecified registry without showing that the credits will actually reduce

27 carbon emissions in the County. Based on the nature of the available

28 registries, carbon offsets may (and are likely) to be purchased relating to

-17-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

emissions in other parts of California, or even out of state or out of country.
2 Second, because there are other approved and proposed GPAs that also rely
3 on, or intend to rely on, the carbon offsets for mitigation for significant GHG
4 emissions (e.g. the Harmony Grove Village South project), there is not
5 substantial evidence in the record to show that the Project's cumulative GHG

6 emissions are reduced below levels of significance. In other words, the

7 record does not evaluate or disclose based on substantial evidence how, if all

8 GPAs rely on carbon offsets, the County can still achieve its emission
9 reduction targets. Third, the County has determined that carbon offsets are
10 only available as mitigation if all feasible on-site design features and
11 mitigation measures have been incorporated into the proposed project, and
12 all design features and mitigation measures must be supported by substantial
13 evidence that impacts have been reduced. This rule makes sense since it is
14 the goal of the 2018 CAP to reduce County-wide emissions and not simply
15 rely on off-sets in other areas outside the County. However, the Project has
16 not first adopted all feasible on-site mitigation measures. For instance, the
17 Project will not be served by public transit which is one tangible way to
18 reduce mobile GHG emissions - again the most significant source of GHG
19 emissions due to the Project. Lastly, the 2018 CAP is currently under legal

20 challenge by Sierra Club and other plaintiffs, with the lawsuit alleging that
21 the carbon offsets are inadequate mitigation under CEQA. More
22 particularly, the lawsuit alleges that the 2018 CAP does not meet the
23 emission reduction requirements pursuant to County General Plan Mitigation

24 Measure CC-1.2. The County's reliance on the carbon offsets as mitigation
25 for the Project, when this mitigation approach is currently under legal

26 challenge, renders the Project's mitigation program uncertain, and therefore

27

28

-18-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 the record does not demonstrate based on substantial evidence that Project

3 mitigation is enforceable and effective as required.

f)

4 The EIR lacks substantial evidence or fails to disclose relevant information

5 relative to the Project's conformance with applicable regional plans. For
instance, the Project is located outside of the Urban Area Transit Strategy

7 Boundary, according to SANDAG's Regional Transportation

8 Plan/Sustainable Community Strategy ("RTP/SCS"). The EIR lacks support

9 for the conclusion that the Project is consistent with the RTP/SCS, or the

10 EIR otherwise fails to disclose relevant information relative to conformance

11 with the RTP/SCS, because the Project's density is far greater and the

12 number of dwelling units is higher than what was included in the land use

13 assumptions for San Diego. The Project must therefore evaluate the

14 Project's unplanned growth on regional climate goals and plans. The

15 RTP/SCS assumes the development of denser communities, namely that

16 80% of all housing would be developed within urbanized areas of the

17 western part of San Diego - not the Project area. The RTP/SCS is based on

18 the fact that Vehicle Miles Traveled (*VMT") will be reduced because of the

19 concentration of development in certain urban areas. The Project is contrary

20 to the assumed development patterns and therefore has impacts that have not

21 been adequately evaluated and are not addressed in the mitigation program.

22 g) The conclusion of less-than-significant aesthetic impacts (long-term) is not

23 supported by substantial evidence. The Project entails substantial grading of

24 natural landforms and the construction of homes extending up hillsides as

25 well as installation of manufactured slopes, retaining walls, sound walls, and

26 extensive fencing. The Project introduces an area of mass grading and man-

27 made structures where none currently exists in the visual setting. The

28 conversion of vacant land with sensitive biological areas and natural

-19-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

NmtAO landforms to urban uses will result in irreversible changes to the area.
Dominant visual elements of the Project on the eastern side will include
extensive manufactured slopes on the Project's eastern boundary. Slopes for
instance in Neighborhood 4 will be a maximum of 60 feet. Aesthetic impacts
are also significant in the long-term because the Project is not consistent with
policies of the County's General Plan including but not limited to Policy
7 COS-12.1. The Project does not preserve hillsides and ridgelines: mass

8 grading of natural landforms will occur. Also, the planned residential
9 development with fencing, sidewalks, and street-lights undermines the
10 General Plan's goals and policies of preserving the area's decidedly rural
11 character.

12 51. CEQA establishes a duty on the part of the lead agency to mitigate the
13 significant environmental impacts of a project. (Public Resources Code § 21002,
14 21002.1; State CEQA Guidelines, § 15021 (a).) A lead agency may not approve a
15 project for which there are significant environmental impacts unless the agency
16 makes findings that: (a) mitigation measures have been required of the project
17 which avoid or substantially lessen the significant environmental impacts, or (b)
18 mitigation measures are found to be infeasible based on substantial evidence.
19 (Public Resources Code §§ 21081, 21081.5; Guidelines, §§ 15091 (a)(b), 15092

20 (b).) Petitioners and others commented that not all feasible mitigation was required
21 of this Project, and Petitioners and others proposed feasible mitigation that has not
22 been shown to be infeasible based on substantial evidence in the record. For

23 instance, Petitioners proposed mitigation with respect to, for instance, fire

24 evacuation where they proposed that the Project construct a roadway connection

25 from the Project site to La Moree Road to provide an additional point of

26 ingress/egress.

27

28

-20-

52. CEQA provides that adopted mitigation measures must be certain and enforceable.

2 (Public Resources Code § 21081.6(b); State CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.6(a)(2).)

3 The lead agency must ensure that mitigation measures are required by or

4 incorporated into the project. (Public Resources Code §21081.6 (b).) Petitioners and

5 others commented that proposed mitigation measures were uncertain, unenforceable,

6 ineffective and/or deferred in violation of CEQA. By way of example, Petitioners

7 and others commented that energy impact mitigation is illusory and unenforceable.

8 The EIR heavily relies on the Project's use of solar energy to find that energy

9 impacts are less-than-significant, i.e., the EIR assumes significant reductions in

10 energy consumption based on the use of solar energy. The EIR implies that the

11 Project's homes will be 100% solar, but solar energy is not an enforceable
12 requirement. In fact, the EIR indicates that the Project may use solar energy, or

13 encourage participation in SDG&E's EcoChoice program, or "equivalent" measures.

14 SDG&E's EcoChoice is a voluntary program by which individual homeowners must
15 elect to participate and continue participation; further, the "equivalent" measures are

16 not defined or disclosed. Accordingly, energy mitigation is unenforceable and

17 deferred in violation of CEQA. Moreover, because the EIR relies upon the use of
18 solar energy in its calculation of GHG impacts, the conclusions of the EIR with
19 respect to GHG energy emissions are faulty.
20 53. CEQA provides that a lead agency has a duty to adopt a project alternative if it is
21 feasible. (Public Resources Code § 21002) A lead agency may not reject an

22 alternative unless the agency makes findings supported by substantial evidence
23 showing that the alternative is infeasible. (State CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15091 (a)(3),
24 15092.) Petitioners and others commented that alternatives were available that

25 would lessen the significant impacts of the proposed project but that these
26 alternatives had not been shown to be infeasible based on substantial evidence in the

27 record. For instance, the General Plan Density Alternative would involve

28

-21-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- development consistent with existing GPA land use designations and it would result

2 in reduced aesthetic and air quality impacts. The General Plan Density Alternative

3 not only reduces significant project impacts but also meets most of the basic project
4 objectives. However, the County has not demonstrated based on substantial

5 evidence that the General Plan Density Alternative is infeasible. The County's

6 CEQA Findings of Fact assert that the General Plan Density Alternative would not

7 meet defined Project Objectives to the "same degree" as the proposed project. This

8 is not a finding of infeasibility of the alternative.

9 54. In addition, the Elfin Forest Harmony Grove Town Council extensively commented

10 that the EIR must evaluate an additional alternative-the "Valiano Vineyards"

11 alternative, which was described in great detail, including financial analyses and
12 independent validation by third party experts, and shown to meet more of the
13 Project Objectives and significantly decrease all impacts. The County declined to

14 evaluate this feasible alternative in the EIR, which was an error.

15 55. CEQA provides that the statement of overriding considerations ("SOC") shall be

16 supported by substantial evidence in the record. (Public Resources Code, §§ 21081
17 (b), 21081.5.)

18 56. The Project's SOC is not supported by substantial evidence. For instance, the SOC
19 is based on unfounded claims such as that the Project with its additional density

20 over existing General Plan land use designations is justified by the need for
21 additional housing. However, the County General Plan already provides adequate
22 housing to meet the planning cycle's Regional Housing Needs Assessment

23 ("RHNA") of 22,412 units. Moreover, the General Plan Housing Element states

24 that "locating future growth in [remote, rural communities] is not consistent with
25 the County's multiple planning objectives." Further, Petitioners demonstrated that
26 the nature of the need for additional housing was in the moderate and below
27

28

-22-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

categories, for which the Project as described is not proposing to create additional

2 housing units.
3 57. CEQA provides that an EIR must be recirculated after significant new information

4 is added after the public comment period. (State CEQA Guidelines § 15088.5.)

5 Significant new information was added to the Final EIR following circulation of the

6 RDEIR, including but not limited to a changed analysis and conclusion with respect

7 to GHG impacts. More particularly, the RDEIR's GHG analysis was based on the

8 County's so-called "Efficiency Metric Document" - an unapproved GHG document

9 that was promulgated by the County in the absence of a final CAP. Following the

10 circulation of the RDEIR and the public comment period thereon, the County

11 adopted a CAP in February 2018. The Final EIR is based on an entirely new

12 threshold of significance and mitigation measures derived from the new CAP.

13 Based on this substantial new information, the County was required to, but did not,
14 further recirculate the EIR for public review and comment.
15 58. For these reasons, the County violated CEQA and the Project approvals must be set
16 aside. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1085, 1094.5; Public Resources Code, §§ 21168,

17 21168.5.)

19 (Writ of Mandate - Violation of General Plan)

20 (As to all Parties)

21 59. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation
22 contained in paragraphs 1-58.

23 60. The Legislature has mandated that every county and city must adopt a
24 "comprehensive, long-term general plan for the physical development of the county
25 or city...The general plan has been aptly described as the *constitution for all future
26 developments' within the city or county'." (Citizens Of Goleta Valley v. Bd. Of
27 Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 570.)

61. "All land use decisions and projects shall be "consistent" with the adopted General

2 Plan. [T]he propriety of virtually any local decision affecting land use and

3 development depends upon consistency with the applicable general plan and its

4 elements' "'The consistency doctrine has been described as 'the linchpin of

5 California's land use and development laws; it is the principle which infuse[s] the

6 concept of planned growth with the force of law'.". (California Native Plant Society

7 V. City of Rancho Cordova (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 603, 636.) This requirement

8 applics to specific plans: Government Code, § 65454 states that "no specific plan may

9 be adopted or amended unless the proposed plan or amendment is consistent with the
10 general plan." Similarly, Government Code, § 66473.5 states that "no local agency
11 shall approve a tentative map... unless the legislative body finds that the proposed

12 subdivision… is consistent with the general plan."

13 62."A project is consistent with the general plan if, considering all its aspects, it will
14 further the objectives and policies of the general plan and not obstruct their

15 attainment.' A given project need not be in perfect conformity with each and every
16 general plan policy. To be consistent, a [project] must be 'compatible with' the

17 objectives, policies, general plan land uses and programs specified in the general
18 plan." (California Native Plant, supra, at 637-638.) However, "[c]onsistency
19 requires more than incantation, and a county cannot articulate a policy in its general

20 plan and then approve a conflicting project." (Endangered Habitats League v.
21 County of Orange (2005) 131 Cal.App.4'h 777, 789.)

22 63. The County prominently states on its website that the 2011 General Plan, "is the

23 first comprehensive update of the San Diego County General Plan since 1978 and is
24 the result of the collective efforts of elected and appointed officials, community
25 groups, individuals, and agencies who spent countless hours developing a

26 framework for the future growth and development of the unincorporated areas of
27 the County. This document replaces the previous General Plan and is based on a set
28

-24-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

of guiding principles designed to protect the County's unique and diverse natural

2 resources and maintain the character of its rural and semi-rural communities. It

3 reflects an environmentally sustainable approach to planning that balances the need

4 for adequate infrastructure, housing, and economic vitality, while maintaining and
preserving each unique community within the County, agricultural areas, and

6 extensive open space." (emphasis added)
7 64. The Project is inconsistent with the General Plan's purposes and objectives relative
to the preservation of rural and semi-rural unincorporated areas of the County as

9 well as the goal to direct urban growth inside Village Boundaries. The Project is

10 inconsistent with the General Plan's "Community Development Model" whereby

11 designated "Villages" would be the only areas of the County with dense residential
12 neighborhoods, commercial and civic uses, and networks of roads, bike lanes, and

13 walkways.

14 65. The Project is also inconsistent with specific General Plan policies including, but
15 not limited to: Policy LU-3.2 in that the Project does not present a "range" of
16 housing types; Policy LU-14.4 in that the Project may induce growth by providing

17 sewer service to any area currently using septic systems; Policy H-1.9 in that there

18 is no affordable housing component to the Project; Policy H-2.1 in that the

19 development "degrade(s) or detract(s) from the character of the rural area"; Policy

20 ME-8.1 regarding the inclusion of transit stops; and Policy S-6.4 in that the Project
21 has not shown that the minimum travel times will be met for fire service.

22 66. The Project is inconsistent with the purpose and objectives of the SDCP including

23 the objective to direct future growth to ensure that areas outside the Village
24 Boundary retain their "rural voice."

25 67. The Project is inconsistent with the purpose and objectives of the EFHGSAP

26 because the Project represents a higher density residential project adjacent to rural
27 residential, large lot uses.

68. By approving the Project when it is inconsistent with the General Plan, the County's
2 actions are arbitrary and capricious, are not supported by substantial evidence, or
3 otherwise fail to comply with the law. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1085, 1094.5.)
4 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

5 (Declaratory Relief - Violation of General Plan)

6 (As to all Parties)

7 69. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation

8 contained in paragraphs 1-68.
9 70. An actual and immediate controversy has arisen and now exists regarding the
10 legality of the County's action in approving multiple GPAs to allow greater
11 densities than permitted by the General Plan in areas that are designated by the
12 General Plan for rural or low-density development.
13 71. The County is required to follow the law including but not limited to the
14 requirement that the County must maintain an internally consistent General Plan

15 and must not approve projects or zoning changes that are inconsistent with General
16 Plan policies.

17 72. The 2011 General Plan adopted a "Community Development Model" to govern
18 development in the County. In this model, designated "Villages" would be the only
19 areas of the County with dense residential neighborhoods, commercial and civic
20 uses, and networks of roads, bike lanes, and walkways. These "Villages" are to be
21 surrounded by semi-rural areas with low density residential neighborhoods, small-
22 scale agricultural operations, and rural commercial businesses. The semi-rural areas
23 are then surrounded by rural lands with very low density residential areas, open
24 space, habitat, recreation, agriculture, and other rural uses.

25 73. This "environmentally sustainable approach to planning" was carefully crafted to
26 achieve numerous 2011 General Plan goals, including reduced vehicle miles
27 traveled, reduced GHG emissions, improved transportation, and the preservation of
28

-26-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

"each unique community with[ in] the County, agricultural arcas, and extensive open
space." mtoo 74. Key to this "Community Development Model" is the County's commitment not to
allow dense residential development outside of existing villages.
75. Yet, in 2018, the County has already "bundled" numerous GPAs, including the
amendments authorizing the development of the Valiano, HGVS, and the Otay 250
7 projects to allow multiple projects to exceed allowable densities and to permit

8 development in areas designated by the General Plan for rural or low-density
9 development. Furthermore, Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereon
10 allege, that the County is currently processing upwards of fifty (50) GPA
11 applications, including the Property Specific Request GPA with forty one Projects,
12 which will allow additional residential development projects to exceed allowable
13 densities and to develop suburban housing projects in rural or low-density areas of
14 the County.
15 76. By approving multiple GPAs that allow higher density residential development in
16 areas that are designated by the General Plan for limited growth or rural uses, the
17 County has created an internally inconsistent General Plan. On the one hand, the
18 core General Plan principle, and numerous General Plan policies, impose strict
19 limitations on where development can occur. On the other hand, the County is
20 continually undermining those limitations by approving amendment after
21 amendment allowing dense development outside of the designated "Villages."
22 77. These amendments also compromise the ability of the County to meet other General
23 Plan requirements such as those related to the reduction of GHGs, transportation
24 management, and affordable housing. There is not substantial evidence that the

25 County can meet its own General Plan requirements when it has approved multiple
26 residential projects that substantially deviate from the density allowances of the
27 General Plan and that will involve growth in areas assumed by the General Plan to
