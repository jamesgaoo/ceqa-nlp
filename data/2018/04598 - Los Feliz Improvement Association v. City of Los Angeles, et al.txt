11. The Project was at issue is described by the City as follows: "The demolition of a
3 gas station, a one-story single-family residence and a one-story duplex; and the construction of a
97,334 square-foot, five-story mixed-use project that includes 87 residential units and

15 PROJECT BACKGROUND, ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND APPROVAL

17 public review. The City received numerous written comments during the public comment 16 13. The City initially prepared an MND for the Project which was circulated for

18 period. The City Planning Commission certified the MND at its hearing on February 8, 2018.

19 14. The Deputy Advisory Agency approved the Vesting Tentative Tract Map, related

20 entitlements, and adopted the Mitigated Negative Declaration. Petitioner timely appealed the
21 Project Approvals to the City Planning Commission ("Planning Commission"). On February 8,
22 2018 the City Planning Commission held a hearing regarding the Project. Appeals were brought
and the Planning and Land Use Management Committee thereafter conducted a hearing and
24 denied the appeals on or about April 17, 2018. On or about April 24, 2018 the City Council held 23

25 public hearings to consider a proposed CEQA Exemption, the MND and the Project approvals.
26 The City Council both determined that the Project was exempt from CEQA and certified an

28

MND and approved all the required discretionary approvals needed to implement the Project.
2 Notwithstanding the fact that the City had conducted an MND for the Project, the City Council
3 nonetheless determined that the Project also exempt from CEQA as a "sustainable communities
project."

CEQA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS

6 15. In 1970, the California Legislature enacted CEQA, as a means of forcing public
agency decision makers, such as Respondent, to document and consider the environmental
8 implications of its actions. CEQA's fundamental goal is to fully inform the public and the
9 decision makers as to the environmental consequences of proposed projects and to assure
10 members of the public that their elected officials are making informed decisions. CEQA requires
11
§ governmental authorities, such as Respondent, to fully evaluate potential environmental effects
Channel Law Group, d77 -L706 12 of projects, and to seek feasible means to reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that
13 8 euns "pAlg eJjyS|!M 00Z8 otherwise could result from their actions, CEQA limits agencies from approving projects with
SI!H Beverly 14 significant adverse impacts when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen such impacts.
15 16. If a project will not result in potentially significant effects on the environment, the
16 government agency may prepare a negative declaration, Mitigated negative declarations are
17 prepared when a project applicant revises a project to eliminate or avoid all significant impacts
18 by incorporating mitigation measures into the project. A proposed mitigated negative
19 declaration circulated for review and comment must describe the project as modified to
20| incorporate mitigation measures. Mitigation measures cannot be improperly deferred and must
21 eliminate or avoid all significant environmental impacts of the project. An agency adopting a
22 mitigated negative declaration must provide members of the public, as well as responsible
23 agencies and trustee agencies with notice of its intention to adopt the mitigated negative
24| declaration. An agency adopting mitigated negative declaration must also adopt a mitigation
25 monitoring or reporting program for the mitigation measures incorporated into the negative
26 declaration.
27

5 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 17. Where substantial evidence in the record of proceedings before the lead agency

2 supports a "fair argument" that one or more significant environmental effects could occur as a

3 result of approval and implementation of a project CEQA requires preparation of an

4 environmental impact report ("EIR"). The primary function of the EIR is to discuss the

5 important environmental consequences of the project, including cumulative effects, and to
6 provide the agency and the general public with mitigation measures and alternatives to the
7 project that would have Jess serious environmental consequences. A lead agency is required to

8 consult with responsible agencies in determining whether an EIR shall be prepared. Responsible
9 agencies are public agencies which propose to carry out or approve a project, for which the lead
10 agency is preparing or has prepared an EIR or negative declaration.
11 18. Under CEQA, lead agencies, such as Respondent, are required to prepare a 008 d11 Group, •LZ06 Beverly C eg SAS TPANEI B LU SIMA OZ8 12 complete and legally adequate EIR prior to approving any discretionary project that may have a
13 significant adverse effect on the environment. The EIR must fully disclose and adequately
14 analyze the project's potentially significant environmental effects. CEQA also requires lead
15 agencies, such as Respondent, to consider. mitigation measures and alternatives to a project, a
16 adopt all feasible mitigation measures and/or alternatives, determine whether proposed
17 mitigation measures will be effective in avoiding or substantially lessening the project's
18 significant environmental impacts, and to make adequate findings, including an adequate
19 statement of overriding consideration for those significant environmental impacts deemed
20 unavoidable. Lead agencies, such as Respondent, may not avoid the duty to prepare an EIR by
21 segmenting project into several smaller projects.
22 19. When government agency adopts a negative declaration, mitigated negative
23 declaration or an EIR, it must exercise its independent judgment and analysis.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

(VIOLATION OF CEQA: Project Does Not Comply with CEQA)

21. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

22. CEQA requires a lead agency for a project to prepare an environmental clearance
document that complies with the requirements of the statute. The lead agency must also provide
8 for public review and comment on the project and associated environmental documentation. The
City's environmental clearance document must provide sufficient environmental analysis such
10 that decision-makers can intelligently consider environmental consequences when acting on
11
§ proposed projects. Channel Law Group, d17 ++Z06 12 23. Respondents violated CEQA by certifying an MND for the Project that is

18 the surrounding neighborhood as well as the applicable specific plan (the so-called
19 SNAP)..
20 C. Failed to adequately analyze and mitigate the Project's noise impacts.
21 24. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion
22 by certifying an MND that does not comply with CEQA and by approving the Project in reliance
23 thereon. Accordingly, Respondent's certification of the MND and approval of the Project must
24 be set aside.

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
(VIOLATION OF CEQA: Inadequate Findings) 2

3 25. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
5 26. CEQA requires that a lead agency's findings for the approval of a project be

6 supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. CEQA further requires that a lead
agency provide an explanation of how evidence in the record supports the conclusions it has

8 reached.

10 of law in that they are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, including, but not
11 limited to, the following. 8 d77 Group, Channel Law L1Z06 12 a. The determination that the Project was exempt from CEQA as a transit priority project SA0  PI NE 13 under CEQA § 21155.1.

qualify for the aforementioned statutory exemption because it is located on the list of hazardous
2 facilities or sites pursuant to Government Code 65962.5.

31. One of the requirements for the exemption is found in section 21155.1(a)(3) of the
Public Resources Code. The requirement of that subdivision is, "The site of the Transit Priority

5 Project is not included on any list of facilities and sites complied pursuant to Section 65962.5 of

6 the Government Code." As noted on page 5 of the SCS Analysis, "the project site is listed in
7 various databases as a result of the former and current service station operations." The
8 SCS Analysis attempts to gloss over this fact by claiming that "there is no substantial
9 information associated with any of the listings that indicate a significant environmental threat to
10 the project site," this is not the issue to which the requirement in SECTION 21155.1(a)(3)
11
8 relates. The issue is whether a further analysis is needed. The statute requires that further

'SIlH Aueneg 14 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION
15 (VIOLATION OF STATE PLANNING AND ZONING LAW AND LOCAL LAW)
16 32. The City's decision to grant the on-menu and off-menu waiver to the Developer
17 was not supported by substantial evidence.
18 33. The Off-Menu Incentives Result in a Windfall to the Applicant Far Exceeding the
19 Waivers Needed to Compensate for the Affordable Units. The essence of the density bonus
20 statute, and the City's implementing ordinance, is to afford developers targeted development
21 incentives sufficient to make a project financially viable including affordable units. "The idea of
22 density bonus law is to cover at least some of the financing gap of affordable housing with
23 regulatory incentives, rather than additional subsidy."
24 34. To this end, developers may be eligible for increased height and floor area, among
25 other incentives. This authority, however, is not a blanket authority to waive development
26 standards for projects including affordable units. The finding mandated by PRC Section

16 consideration, was entirely ignored in its determination and in the findings of approval. Despite
17 expert opinion concluding the incentives are granting a windfall to the developer, the findings do
18 not even address this possibility. The administrative record, therefore, includes substantial and

(DECLARATORY RELIEF) 2

3 41. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in

4 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

42. Petitioner seeks a judicial declaration that Respondents' adoption of a Mitigated
6 Negative Declaration for the Project failed to comply with the requirements of CEQA.

43. Respondents have a mandatory duty to comply with CEQA and other legal

8 requirements applicable to the Project.

13 8 euns "pAla aJlysI!m ooZ8 the actions and conduct of Respondents alleged in this Petition have violated CEQA and other
'SILH Áueneg 14 laws as identified herein. This controversy implicates the legality of the manner in which
15 Respondents have proceeded in giving the Project Approvals, the validity of the Respondents'
16 actions with respect thereto and, consequently, the legal ability of Respondents to take further
17 actions to develop the Project based upon the Project Approvals. The Petitioner contends that
18 each and all such actions and conduct have violated and will violate these laws. Petitioner is

19 informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that Respondents dispute these contentions. A
20 judicial resolution of that controversy is now required pursuant to California Code of Civil
21 Procedure section 1060.

22 47. Petitioner requests a judicial declaration that Respondents' actions and conduct
23 alleged in this Petition have violated and will violate CEQA and other laws identified herein.
24 Such declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time under the circumstances in order that

To Whom It May Concern:
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under California Public Resources Code section 21167.5, that Petitioner, Los Feliz Improvement Association, intends to immediately file a Petition for Writ of Mandate ("Petition") under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), inter alia, against the City of Los Angeles ("City") and Real Party in Interest Western and Franklin, LLC.

The Petition will also allege that the City violated the California's Planning and Zoning Law, as well as local law, when it approved the Project. The City Council of the City of Los Angeles approved the Project on or about April 11, 2018.

Sincerely

Jamie T. Hall
Attorney for Petitioner
