23 Petitioner and Plaintiff ALIZE' LLC alleges as follows:

24 THE PARTIES

25 1. Petitioner and Plaintiff ALIZE' LLC is a California Limited Liability Company, duly

26 formed and doing business in Redding, CA, and an owner of real property in Redding, CA-

27 -A.P. No. 115180028000-- directly impacted by the matters alleged herein.

28

PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 2. Respondent and Defendant City of Redding is a duly organized municipal
2 corporation and general law city in Shasta County, of the State of California.
C0 4 L0 0N 00 3. Respondents and Defendants City Council of the City of Redding is the duly
authorized legislative decision-making body of the City of Redding, and they are named
herein in their official capacity only.
4. Petitioner /Plaintiff is unaware of the true names, identities, and capacities of
Respondents/Defendants Does 1 through 20 inclusive, who are unknown to Petitioner /
Plaintiff, who therefore sues those parties by fictitious names. Petitioner / Plaintiff is
9 informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that they are agents, employees or servants
10 of the other Respondents/Defendants, and while acting in the course of scope of such
11 agency or representation are responsible in some way for the conduct described in this
12 pleading. Petitioner / Plaintiff will seek leave of court to amend this pleading to name them
13 by their true names and capacities as soon as they may be ascertained.

14 INTRODUCTION, FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND ALLEGATIONS

15 5. This proceeding and action pertains to the Redding City Council approval of a new
16 updated Parks Trails Open Space Master Plan (hereafter either "PLAN" or "PTOSMP") on
17 August 21, 2018, accompanied by adoption and approval of an "Addendum" to the

18 Mitigated Negative Declaration carried over from the 2000-2020 General plan, such that

19 there was no public notice for opportunity for input on the environmental consequences of
20 the Open Space component of the PLAN, nor was there any new or adequate CEQA
21 environmental review of the major wildfire risks / hazards caused by the City's Open Space
22 policies, much less consideration of the drastic changes in the City's Open Space
23 environment due to the Carr fire. Over the objections of commenters present at the Council
24 meeting of August 21, 2018, the City Council --- in derogation of CEQA's mandate for

25 informed open and public decision-making that considers consequences to the

26 environment--- voted to continue the failed wildfire risk mitigations of the 2000 General
27 Plan that had just substantially contributed to the worst wildfire disaster in the history of
28 Redding, and acted in contravention of the more stringent wildfire risk mitigations of the
2

PETITION AND COMPLAINT

H November 2015 Local Hazard Mitigation Plan adopted by the City Council (Resolution No.

2 2014-095) which were supposed to have been brought into this PLAN and the General Plan,
CO 1 LO O and ignored both the drastic environmental baseline change in the burned open space in
Redding as well as the unmitigated environmental wildfire risks to the open spaces in
Redding that escaped the Carr fire.
6. The factual history to this matter begins with the 2000 General Plan. The general

7 plan of a city is sometimes referred to as the "constitution" of land use, development, and
8 related municipal policies, because of the statutory primacy given to the general plan in

9 guiding the future course of a changing city. Redding's 2000 General Plan is a
10 comprehensive document with multiple elements. An EIR was required for adoption of the
11 Redding 2000 General Plan, and the portion of the EIR dealing specifically with
12 "WILDLAND AND URBAN FIRE POTENTIAL" is at section 8.2, a true copy of which is
13 attached hereto as Ex. A, p. 000002-7. [Petitioner has attached documentary exhibits hereto

14 by sequential letters of the alphabet, and also the entire package of documentary exhibits -
15 for convenience of reference-has been sequentially "bates numbered."] The General Plan

16 EIR recognizes in relation to "Wildland Fire Hazards" that (p.000003);

17 Significant parts of the urban area are a mixture of wildland and urban

18 and rural uses (i.e., wildland / urban interface). Much of the wildland /urban interface is located within the Redding city limits,
19 particularly within the numerous gulches and greenways adjacent to urban uses. The presence of urban uses adjacent to wildlands increases
20 the likelihood of wildland fires, and the presence of wildlands adjacent to urban areas allows fires to spread rapidly to other urban
21 and rural areas. Figure 8-2 shows the very high fire hazard areas within the urban area as determined by the California Department of 22 Forestry (CDF). [see p. 4}

23

24 As to environmental impact, the EIR states (p. 000003-5):

25 For purposes of this EIR, an impact is considered significant if adoption or implementation of the General Plan would result in a significant increase in the
26 exposure of people to major fire hazards. ... New development proposed under the General Plan Diagram would increase the number of structures and
27 persons that would be subject to potential fires by increasing the size of the building stock and number of residents and employees in the urban area. Also
28 the presence of urban uses adjacent to urban areas allows fires to spread

3

PETITION AND COMPLAINT

Wildland fire hazards are greatest 1 rapidly to other urban and rural areas. along the western, eastern, and northern boundary of the urban area. These 2 areas contain open space, residential, and public facility uses. (emphasis
0 ÷0 0N added)

7. Thus wildland fire poses a significant environmental impact unless it is mitigated.
The General Plan EIR presents the following policies to purportedly mitigate "wildlife and
urban fire issues" (p. 000005):

FIS4A. Maintain an Insurance Service Office (ISO) rating of 3 or better.

8 HS4R. Require that all new development and redevelopment meet State and local standards for fire protection; encourage the upgrade of existing structures to current standards.
9
HS4C. Work with local water districts to ensure that district systems are developed, maintained, and monitored to
10 provide minimum fire-flow, rates peak load cepacity for fire suppression.

11 HS4D. Require remote hillside developments to maintain sufficient uater supplies on site, when appropriate, to provide wildland fire protection. Water supplies may be stored in the form of ponds, starage tanks, or other 12 features acceptable to the Fire Marshal.

13 HS4F. Construct emergency-access routes to open-space areas at optimal locations within developments.
14 Deuelop a comprebensive vegetation management and weed abatement program for open-space areas, HS4G.
15 incuding those tbat ave located in existing subelivisions.

16 HS4H. Establish a program to construct and maintain fire-access roads in ravine areas considered to bave a very high fire dunger to enhance the ability to suppress wildland fires. These roads need not be surfaced and may also
17 function as part of the Cuy's trail system. Erosion and impacts to native vegetation and natural features shall be minimized.
18
1S4l. Amend subdivision regulations to ensure thai cnl-de-sac lengths are generalty no grEater thn 600 feet and
19 should have a sufficient tarnaround area. Longer cul-desacs may be considered if additional measures are incorporated to ensure the safety of residents and emergency response personnet. 20
HIS4J. Amend subdivision regulations to ensure that residential subdivisions have at least two poinas of access. 21
HS4K. Maintain and augment mutual and automatic aid agreements with the California Department of Foresry
22 (CDF) and Shasta County.

23 HS4L. Continue to promote fire pevention tbrough education and public awareness programs.

24

25 Based on the above mitigations the 2000 General Plan EIR concluded at that time that
26 (p.000006): "Therefore, the urban and wildland fire hazard impacts related to development
27

28

4

PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 under the General Plan would be less than significant. ... No mitigation measures beyond the

2 policies of the General Plan and existing regulations are necessary."
3 8. Years later closer review of wildfire risk by CAL FIRE resulted in recommendations
4 of "VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES" in Shasta County, as shown on the
5 map attached hereto as Ex. B, p. 000009. A close-up expanded view of the City of Redding

6 area on the CAL FIRE map is attached at p. 000010. As shown there, large portions (1/3 or
7 more) of the western and northern areas of the City are in the red VERY HIGH FIRE

8 HAZARD SEVERITY ZONE.

9 9. The Congress of the United States had passed Public Law 106-390, also known as
10 the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000, to provide federal funding support for state and local
11 pre-disaster mitigation planning and projects, to reduce risk and prevent loss from future

12 hazard events. In 2014 the City of Redding elected to participate in this program, and with
13 the aid of CDBG funds produced the "LOCAL HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN, November

14 2015." Official City approval and recognition of participation in the LOCAL HAZARD
15 MITIGATION PLAN (LHMP) was given by adoption of Resolution No. 2014-095 (Ex. C,

16 p.000021). The LHMP was approved by FEMA on November 16, 2015.

17 10. The 2015 LHMP engaged in a detailed analysis and planning process for a variety
18 of potential local hazards, which -after screening-focused on wildland fire hazards, flood
19 risk, hazardous materials, and earthquake. Attached as Ex. C is a true copy of the
20 introductory general portion of the LHMP along with the portion of the LHMP specifically
21 addressing "Wildland Fire." Some significant points of information as to the environmental

22 setting in Redding as having a severely high risk for wildland fire and vulnerability to

23 wildfire losses, are found throughout this text in the LHMP:

24 The "Risk-Assessment - Hazard Identification" table (p. 000037) finds that wildfire must

25 be assessed as a local hazard because "Past events have been experienced by the City" and

26 "The City encompasses and is adjacent to many natural open-space areas." (emphasis
27 added)

28

PETITION AND COMPLAINT

3 The "Summary of Potential Significant Hazard-Related Exposure / Loss in Redding" table

NO 0 P (p. 000037) shows, inter alia, estimates for Wildland Fire that: the "exposed population" at
risk is 13,437, number of residential structures at risk is 4,884, and value of residential
structures at risk is $686.5M.
The text (p. 000027-28) on the nature of wildland fire in Redding is descriptive of the

0o environment: "Hills and mountains surround the westerly portion of the City of Redding,

9 which is covered mostly with grasses, brush, Manzanita, oak trees, and gray pines.

10 Summer drought causes vegetation to become extremely dry, and a regional weather a

11 phenomenon, the northerly winds, can aggravate an already very hazardous fire situation.

12 The hillside areas of the western portion of the City have, therefore, been classified as a
high fire hazard severity zone. With extreme dryness, relative humidity often 10 percent or very

13

14 less, high temperatures over 100 degrees, and 20 to 40 mph winds, a wildfire can become
uncontrolled, spreading through vegetative fuels and exposing and possibly consuming

structures.

15

16 Other factors increase the wildfire hazard. These include dense vegetation

17 growth and large accumulation of dead plant materials in areas that have not been

18 mitigated or burned for many years. Steep terrain compounds the wildfire risk because fires

19 normally burn much faster uphill. Rugged terrain also hinders fire-suppression attempts by

20 hampering the mobility effectiveness of firefighters and equipment. If not promptly

21 controlled, wildland fires may grow into an emergency or disaster. Firestorms occur during

22 extreme weather with such intensity that fire suppression is virtually impossible. These

23 events typically burn until the conditions change or the fuel is exhausted. Even small fires

24 can threaten lives and resources and destroy improved properties."

25 The text (p. 000040) describing the "Effects of Wildfires" is especially pertinent to the

26 environmental conditions now faced in Redding following the Carr fire: "Wildfires

27 generally have the most impact on the natural environment. ...Watershed, wildlife, and

28 recreational areas are lost due to wildfire. After the fire has been extinguished, the
burned land is laid bare of its protective vegetation cover and is susceptible to excessive
runoff and erosion. The fire will often destroy the root system of shrubs and grasses that

PETITION AND COMPLAINT 6

1 aid in stabilizing slope material. When the winter rains come, the possibility of

2 landslides and debris/mud flows are greatly increased. ...Flood-control facilities may be
G inadequate to handle the increased storm-runoff debris from barren and burned hills. "

4 (emphasis added)
• In the description of the "Wildland Urban Interface" (p. 000042) the LHMP identifies that
D wildland fire is a "major problem" for areas in "approximately 39 percent of the City that
7 are identified as very high severity zone. . As development extends more and more into

8 the areas identified as very high severity zones, the situation becomes increasingly acute."

9 • In regard to the "History" of wildland fires in Redding the LHMP (at p. 000042) discloses

10 that "The City of Redding experiences close to over 150 wildland fires each year, which
11 have been destructive to our community."

12 Concerning "Future Events" the LHMP states (p. 000042): "Given the topography, climate
13 and vegetation on the west side of Redding, it is ripe and conducive to having fast-

14 spreading wildfires. According to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection

15 and as shown on Shasta County's Fire Hazard Map, all the hillsides in west Redding are
16 located within the very high fire hazard severity zone, including areas to the north and east

17 of town. The history of the wildfire activity in Shasta County is traumatic, and we will

18 continue to be faced with wildland fires that threaten lives and property every summer."

19 Under the heading "Vulnerability" the LHMP (p. 000043) describes what might happen in
20 a wild fire: "The City of Redding recently ran a fire scenario on the a west side, which was

21 derived from an actual fire occurrence in the area. As a result of the fire-scenario

22 information, it was discovered that 17 percent of all structures in the City could be affected
23 by this fire, with a potential dollar loss of $135,300,000. This fire would be 10,250 acres in

24 size and displace approximately 13,437 people (See Figure 6)." [Despite inquiries with the
25 City Clerk, the City Planning Dept., and the public library, "Figure 6" could not be located

26 at this time.]

27 Under "Mitigations" the LHMP (p. 000044) lists the following objectives and affirmative
28 actions, which are different, more expansive, and more stringent than the mitigations
7

PETITION AND COMPLAINT

- outlined in the Redding 2000 General Plan EIR:

2 Goal 5:
P G Reduce the possibility of property demage and life losses due to wildland fires.
Objective 5.A: Enforce Fire and Building Codes and the General Plan for the City of Redding, which will minimize damage to homes and structures from wildland fires.

5 Action 5.A.1: Ensure that new subdivisions have adequate fire-protection measures, such as multiple accesses for fire apparatus, noncombustible building construction, residential sprinkler
D systems, appropriate defensible space, and street widths and grade to accommodate emergency vehicles and evacuees simultaneously.
7 Action 5.A.2:

8 Ensure that defensible space is being provided for all new and existing homes. Ensure that roofing material is noncombuslible on new homes and that wood shake roofs on

9 existing homes, when replaced, meet Code requirements for non-combustibility. Install a spark-arresting system on chimneys of homes with wood-buming fireplaces. Partial funding is provided for abatement of City properties.
10 Action 5.A.3:

11 Continue the development of landscape maintenance districts for new developments to fund ongoing fuel reduction and maintenance of defensible space.

12 Objective 5.B: Educate the public about wildland fire dangers and the steps that can be taken to prevent or minimize their effects.

13 Action 5.B.1:

14 Ensure that the City provides sufficient resources for public education, wildland fire mitigation and guidance, and emergency planning for the public, as funding becomes available.

15 Aclion 5.B.2:
16 Distribute wildland fire mitigation information to persons applying for building permits in the City of Redding in the very high fire hazard severity zone.

17 Objective 5.C: Reduce the probability of fire ignitions.

18 Aclion 5.C.1: Focus on human causes of ignition and address the problem through education and

19 enforcement actions, to include vigorous investigation and prosecution of arson.

Objective 5.D:
20 Maintain Emergency Operations Center for coordination of information and resources.

Aclion 5.D.1:
21 Ensure that annual emergency Operations Center exercise is performed. Funding is availabie to conduct exercises.

22 Objective 5.E: Reduce the potential for destructive actions of the fire once ignition occurs, utilizing fire

23 pre-plans, ensuring a property trained, staffed, and equipped emergency response capability, and timely response to prevent the spread of the fire, minimizing risks to

24 humans and property.

Action 5.E.1:
25 Ensure that adequate resources are available to pre-plan for incidents that may occur in the very high fire hazard severity zones within the City of Redding.

26 Action 5.E.2: Ensure continued training of personnel responsible for responses to wildland fires with

27 the most current strategies, tactics, and safety actions.

Action 5.E.3:
28 Ensure that equipment is purchased and maintained to address the wildland fire risk
within the community.

8

PETITION AND COMPLAINT

00 NOUTAO NF Action 5.E.4: Increase staffing of current two-person companies to three-person companies to improve capabilities and initial actions at fire incidences within the community as additional funding becomes available.
Action 5.E.5 Continue to maintain training and response actions with cooperating fire agencies.

Under "Implementation Through Existing Programs" (p. 000048) the LHMP specifies that:
After the City officially adopts the Plan, these existing mechanisms will have hazard
mitigation strategies integrated into them. The Emergency Services Coordinator will ensure

9 incorporation of hazard mitigation strategies during the periodic reviews of the City's

10 comprehensive plans and land use policies."

11 Under "Capital Improvement Plan" the LHMP (p. 000049) states "After formal adoption

12 of the Hazard Mitigation Plan, the action items in the Plan will be incorporated into existing
plans as is practical."
13

14 • And under the heading "General Plan" the LHMP (p. 000049) states that "when

15 corrections in a plan are needed, the plan needs to be revised" and "The Hazard Mitigation

16 Plan mission statement and goals should be cohesive with and align with the mission and
goals of the City's General Plan."
17 •

18 Figure 5 from the LHMP, attached at p. 000050, is still the current map in use by the City

19 for the "Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone" in Redding. The orange-shaded area of the

20 map, covering about 39% of the City of Redding, illustrates the zone of severe risk for
wildland fires.

24 close-up depiction of the area where the Alize' LLC parcel is located, with open-space areas

25 shown in light green and dark green. By cross-reference to the map at p. 000050 it may be

26 seen that the "Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone" overlaps these open-space areas and
the location of the Alize' LLC parcel.

PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 12. Attached hereto as Ex. E (p. 000055) is a GIS map created by the City of Redding

2 depicting in large scale the perimeter of the intrusion of the recent Carr fire into the City of
00 1 LO O Redding and the overlap of the fire perimeter into the Very High Fire Hazard Severity
Zone. The Alize' LLC parcel is within the "overlap" area depicted on this map.
13. Attached hereto as Ex. F (p. 000056-57) are two satellite photographs taken prior to
the recent Carr fire. The first (p. 000056) shows the Land Park and Stanford Hills
subdivisions, surrounded by open space and heavy vegetation. The Alize' LLC parcel is
0p adjacent and immediately north of the Stanford Hills subdivision. And, more specifically,

9 the satellite photo and graphic at p. 000057 is from the Shasta County GIS department,
10 showing a blue line perimeter of A.P. No. 115180028000 - the Alize' LLC parcel as located
11 within the City limits. Prior to the Carr fire, which began on July 23, 2018, and through the
12 present day, Alize' LLC has been in the preliminary process of obtaining City review and
13 approvals for potential residential development of portions of the subject 243 acre parcel.
14 14. Attached hereto as Ex. G (p. 000060-62) are 3 aerial photographs taken after the
15 recent Carr fire burned the Alize' LLC parcel. The first photo (p. 000060) shows the burned

16 expanse of the Alize' LLC parcel in foreground while depicting the Land Park and Stanford
17 Hills subdivisions in the background. The second photo (p. 000061) is taken directly over

18 the Alize' LLC parcel. The third photo is taken over the Stanford Hills subdivision and

19 depicts the Alize' LLC parcel in the upper-right quadrant. As depicted, the entire 243 acre
20 Alize' LLC parcel was burned in the Carr fire.
21 15. Attached hereto as Ex. H (p. 000064-68) is a map a of the Carr fire burn area and
22 related material from "Verisk" - a data analytics company serving fire insurance providers.
23 The map and text are descriptive of the "FireLine" risk analysis method that has been in use

24 for about three years by fire insurance providers to assess the risk and insurability of lands
25 subject to potential wildland fires. The FireLine analysis has also become the primary tool of

26 the ISO for assessing wildfire risk, as a supplement and replacement for the "public
27 facilities" rating that merely measures the proximity of a property to public fire-fighting
28 resources like municipal fire stations and street fire hydrants. Many of the houses and
10

PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 properties destroyed by the Carr fire had an ISO (public facilities) rating of 3.0 or better; the

2 "mitigation measure" policy of the Redding 2000 General Plan EIR merely strives for an ISO
3 (public facilities) rating of 3.0; this old "mitigation measure" is not currently relevant or

4 effective in mitigating wildfire risk. However, applying the current FireLine method (p.
5 000066) "Three factors influence the impact of wildfire risk on property losses: fuel, slope,
6 and access. The primary risk factor is a property's proximity to vegetation -grass, trees, and
7 scrub or brush-which provides fuel for a fire." The mitigation measures described in the

8 City Local Hazard Mitigation Plan, though not mentioning FireLine analysis by name,

9 address the factors in the analysis particularly by requiring cleared "defensible space"
10 not only in new development proposals but also as an affirmative mitigation for existing
11 housing and residential areas in the City's severe hazard zone. According to the Verisk

12 analysis (p. 000066), in the area within the Carr fire perimeter FireLine data showed that

13 99% of the area was at risk, "with more than 90% at high or extreme risk."

14 16. Attached hereto as Ex. I (p. 000070) is a GIS map showing, in addition to the
15 perimeter of the Carr fire burn area, the evacuation area extending into the City -
16 illustrating the displacement of persons impacted by the fire, and the mass of population
17 that would have a direct interest in City open space plans and policies as their protection (or
18 lack thereof) relates to wildfire risk. It has been estimated that at the high point of the Carr

19 fire in August of 2018 as many as 35,000 people were evacuated from the City of Redding.
20 17. Attached hereto as Ex. (p. 000072-73) is a closing incident report dated August 30,
21 2018 from CAL FIRE at 100% containment of the Carr fire, showing that the fire had burned
22 about 229,651 acres and destroyed 1,079 residential structures.

23 18. Attached hereto as Ex. K (p. 000075-76) is a true copy of the Notice of Public

24 Hearing published August 10, 2018 in the Record Searchlight newspaper classified section
25 for the August 21, 2018 meeting of the Redding City Council for consideration of the Parks,

PETITION AND COMPLAINT

2 19. Attached hereto as Ex. L (p. 000078-79) is a true copy of the second Notice of Public

D Hearing published August 15, 2018 in the Record Searchlight newspaper classified section
for the August 21, 2018 meeting of the Redding City Council for consideration of the Parks,
Trails and Open Space Master Plan. This public notice also makes no mention whatsoever of

N consideration of any environmental review for the PLAN, much less any consideration of
adoption / approval of an Addendum and Mitigated Negative Declaration.

8 20. Attached hereto as Ex. M (p. 000081-121) is a true copy of the portions of the Parks,

9 Trails and Open Space Master Plan dealing with "Open Space." The noteworthy points of

10 information relating to environmental issues are twofold: (1) the PLAN touts the

11 achievements of the City in creating open space as an amenity for residents of the City,

12 creates goals for acquiring more open space, and seeks funding for open space acquisition

13 and improvements --- all of which have a positive aspect for enjoyment by residents and

14 visitors to the City but which also carry increased hazards and wildfire risks that are not

15 acknowledged by the PLAN; and (2) there is no provision in the PLAN for mitigation of

16

17 increased wildfire hazards and risks. The map in the PLAN (at p. 000120) for existing open
space depicts the extensive open space already present in the City. The "Open Space

18

19 Suitability Analysis Map" in the PLAN (p. 000121) depicts the potential and City ambitions
for even further expansion of the open space areas in the City.

20

21 21. Attached hereto as Ex. N (p. 000123-125) is the City staff report for consideration of
approval and adoption of the PLAN along with the "Mitigated Negative Declaration"

22

23 prepared for the PLAN at the Council meeting of August 21, 2018. The staff report is signed
off by the City Community Services Director on August 10, 2018 and by the City Manager

on

24
25 August 14, 2018 - both following the inception of the Carr fire on July 23, 2018.

26 22. Attached as Ex. O (p. 000127-145) is the "Addendum To A Mitigated Negative

27 Declaration" prepared and signed off by the Planning Manager of the City of Redding on
July 17, 2018 --- prior to the inception of the Carr fire on July 23, 2018. The Addendum

28 essentially states that nothing environmentally significant relating to open space (and parks
and trails) has occurred since the 2000 General Plan EIR, and then reaffirms the original
12

PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND) used for the first version of the Parks, Trails and

2 Open Space Master Plan from 2002-which relied entirely on the 2000 General Plan EIR
00 ÷ LO ON "Wildland and Urban Fire Potential" mitigations (see p. 000005 attached hereto) as listed in
the box on the table attached to the MND on the last page; in that table (p. 000145) the
environmental risk of "Wildland and Urban Fire Potential" is shown as "Potentially
significant" but after application of the 2000 General Plan EIR mitigations is converted to
"Less than significant."

8 24. At the City Council meeting of August 21, 2018 the Manager of Alize' LLC

9 commented and objected "on all grounds possible" to adoption and approval of the PLAN
10 under these circumstances, inclusive of the City's lack of and disregard for environmental
11 review of its open space plans, policies and actions which had just proven to be a failure in
12 mitigating risk to residents of Redding from the disastrous Carr wildfire. Other commenters
13 echoed concern, and its was noted that the Addendum and MND had been prepared before

14 the Carr fire occurred, and no account had been taken for the new environmental

15 information and the drastic change in environmental conditions as a consequence of the
16 fire. The City Council and staff responded to comments and concerns by stating that those
17 concerns could or should be addressed at some indefinite later time when the City

18 undertakes particular actions to implement the PLAN.

19 23. Attached hereto as Ex. P (p. 147-151) is a true copy of the Redding City Council
20 "Action Agenda" which reflects the actions taken by the City Council at its meeting of
21 August 21, 2018, which include: approval of the revised and updated Parks, Trails and
22 Open Space Master Plan; findings that the PLAN is consistent with the City of Redding
23 2000-2020 General Plan; and adopted the Mitigated Negative Declaration for the PLAN.
24 24. Under CEQA, a project is the whole of an action, and not each individual approval;
25 and CEQA compliance cannot be avoided by dividing a project into smaller sub-projects to
26 avoid consideration of environmental impacts of the project as a whole.

27

PETITION AND COMPLAINT

-

1

2 25. An agency's authorization of an activity, such as the revised / updated PLAN in

3 a this case, that starts in motion a chain of events that will result in reasonably foreseeable

4 environmental impacts constitutes approval of a project under CEQA.

5 26. CEQA requires that the environmental review process begin before bureaucratic

6 momentum behind a project builds, leading the agency as a practical matter to commit to

7 the project, which would render the ultimate project approval and the conditions of
approval a post hoc rationalization.

8

9 27. The function of CEQA to advance informed civic decision-making that truly

10 considers the impacts of project on the environment and involves the public in the in the

11 process, cannot be advanced when meaningful review of the consequences of a project

12 approval are deferred to an indefinite later time and the project is already underway.

13 28. The City of Redding approval of the revised / updated PLAN and adoption of an

14 Addendum and Mitigated Negative Declaration violated CEQA, thwarted environmental

15 review, and excluded necessary and meaningful public environmental consideration of the

16 City's open space program, policies and practices, particularly as they impact the citizenry

17 (including Petitioner / Plaintiff) and the environment with regard to wildland fires.

18 29. The actions of the City and City Council on August 21, 2018 violated CEQA

19 Guidelines 14 CCR §15164 and §15162 by failing to conduct subsequent environmental

20 review through a new EIR (or other environmental review documentation such as a new

21 Initial Study and Negative Declaration if that could be justified), without having any

22 substantial evidence in the record to reject further environmental review. In particular, but

23 without limitation, the City and City Council dismissed or failed to consider:

24 That the Addendum and MND were prepared before the Carr fire-which both revealed

25 the inadequacy of wildfire hazard mitigation measures carried forward in the

26 revised / updated PLAN and drastically changed the environmental baseline and setting

upon which the MND was based;

27

28 That the MND wildland fire mitigation measures, which bootstrapped its wildfire
mitigation measures form the 2000 General Plan EIR, were and are in conflict with the
14

PETITION AND COMPLAINT

-

I -

2
0  O 0T A G mitigation measures also adopted by the City and City Council for the more protective 2015
Local Hazard Mitigation Plan, even though the City had committed to conform its land use
policies and General Plan to the mitigations and actions required by the LHMP;
That new information showed that 39% of the City of Redding, i.e. in primarily residential
areas surrounded by open space overgrown with wildfire fuel loads, is in a Very High Fire
Hazard Severity Zone, and increasing population growth/development has been and
continues to exacerbate that hazard;

9

10 That the severity of wildfire risk, the City's vulnerability to wildfire conflagration, and the

11 probability of repeated wildfire incidents is far greater than had been anticipated or

12 planned for in the environmental review conducted for the old 2000 General Plan EIR;

13 That the former mitigation measure of maintaining an ISO public facilities rating of 3.0 is

14 no longer directly relevant or effective in reducing wildfire risk, and the current standard

15 evaluation tool of FireLine factors (fuel/slope/ access) requires different and
aggressive mitigation actions to reduce risks to acceptable levels. more

16

17 That the environmental baseline and setting has been drastically changed by the Carr fire

18 in affected expansive portions of the City's open space areas that were burned, with the

19 creation of new environmental hazards where the burned land is laid bare of its vegetative

20 protective cover and (when the "rain season" arrives in only a few weeks) is susceptible to

21 excessive runoff and erosion, causing destabilization of slopes, flooding, landslides,

22 debris /mud flows, degradation of water quality in streams and the Sacramento River, and

23 potential substantial harm to endangered fish spawning habitat.

24 30. The City Respondents/Defendants did not disclose any evidentiary evaluation or

25 meet their burden under CEQA to support the actions and approvals taken on August 21,

26 2018. CEQA standards, in light of the clear environmental evidence, facts and circumstances

27 present on August 21, 2018 require preparation and consideration of an Environmental
Impact Report.

2 action, including providing prior notice to the City Respondents / Defendants of the filing of
00 4 LO OA 00 this action and notice to the State Attorney General.
32. Respondents/Defendants abused their discretion in taking the aforedescribed
actions on August 21, 2018 in approving and adopting the PLAN, Addendum and MND in
violation of the mandatory requirements of CEQA, such that mandamus relief is
appropriate under CCP §1085 and Public Resources Code §21168.

9 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION - DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

10 33. Plantiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 32 above as
11 though fully set forth at length herein.

12 34. A dispute and public controversy exists between Plaintiff and Defendants as to the

13 legal duties and obligations of the City of Redding under its own planning and land use

14 laws -the 2000 General Plan and the adopted 2015 Local Hazard Mitigation Plan and the

15 just adopted revised /updated Parks, Trails and Open Space Master Plan-especially as to

16 the obligations of the City to both perform environmental review and mitigate wildfire risks
17 and post-wildfire risks in regard to City open space. Plaintiff contends that the City has :
18 present duty to both review the potential risks and actively mitigate the risks attendant to
19 wild fire in the City open spaces, while the City Defendants contend that review can be
20 deferred to the indefinite future and that open space policies / practices described in the

21 2000 General Plan EIR are adequate today to mitigate wildfire hazards.

22 35. Plaintiff further alleges that the actions taken by the City Defendants in making

23 their approvals of the PLAN and Addendum and MND on August 21, 2018 are ultra vires,

24 contrary to law, an abuse of discretion, invalid, and void ab initio, whereas the City
25 Defendants contend that the same approvals on August 21, 2018 are valid in all respects.
26 36. A court determination is required to settle and resolve the present dispute and
27 controversy and exists between these parties. No form of monetary relief is adequate to
28 address these issues. Plaintiff has performed all conditions precedent to obtain equitable

Chapter &: Health and Safety
Specific General Plan policies would help minimize geologic impacts. General Plan Policy HS1A requires new structures and alterations to existing structures comply with the seismic safety requirements of the
UBC. Policy HS1B would provide protection from liquefaction hazards by requiring future development to develop mitigation plans, and to incorporate necessary infrastructure in areas with a high liquefaction potential. Policy HS1C would require determination of the landslide, slope-instability, and erosion potential of proposed development sites located in potential hazard areas. Compliance with these General Plan policies would minimize the seismic and geologic impacts associated with development under the General Plan, and, therefore, would be considered less than significant.

MITIGATION MEASURES

No mitigation measures beyond the policies of the General Plan are necessary.

8.2

-- WILDLAND AND URBAN FIRE POTENTIAL

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

The urban area is subject to both urban and wildland fire hazards.

Urban Fire Hazards

Many residential, commercial, and industrial structures in the urban area are subject to fire hazards related
to electrical shorts, industrial accidents, arson, or simple carelessness. These risks are generally greatest in older structures constructed before strong building and fire codes were enacted.

Wildland Fire Hazards

Significant parts of the urban area are a mixture of wildland and urban and rural uses (i.e., wildland/urban interface). Much of the wildland/urban interface is located within the Redding city limits, particularly within the numerous gulches and green ways adjacent to urban uses. The presence of urban uses adjacent to wildlands increases the likelihood of wildland fires, and the presence of wildlands adjacent to urban
areas allows fires to spread rapidly to other urban and rural areas. Figure 8-2 shows the very high fire hazard areas within the urban area as determined by California Department of Forestry (CDF).

METHODOLOGY

This section describes the assumptions and thresholds of significance developed to assess impacts resulting from development anticipated under the General Plan Diagram. The analysis was conducted by considering areas with high potential for wildland fire hazards in relation to the areas proposed for new development under the General Plan Diagram.
Assumptions
New development in the urban arca would require expanded fire protection services in order to meet the Redding Fire Department's standard for response timnes (see Fire Protection, Section 6.2, Other Public Facilities and Services).
Thresholds of Significance
For purposes of this EIR, an impact is considered significant if adoption or implementation of the General Plan would result in a significant increase in the exposure of people to major fire hazards.

- . - 3 Chapter 8: Health and Safety
IMPLICATIONS OF THE GENERAL PLAN DIAGRAM
New development proposed under the General Plan Diagram would increase the number of structures and persons that would be subject to potential fires by increasing the size of the building stock and the number of residents and employees in the urban area. Also, the presence of urban uses adjacent to wildlands increases the likelihood of wildland fires, and the presence of wildlands adjacent to urban areas allows fires to spread rapidly to other urban and rural areas.
GENERAL PLAN POLICY RESPONSE

The following General Plan policies address wildlife and urban fire issues:

HS4A. Maintain an Insurance Service Office (ISO) rating of 3 or better.

HS4B. Require that all new development and redevelopment meet State and local slandards for fire protection; encourage the upgrade of existing structures to current standurds.

HS4C. Work with local water districts to ensure that district systems are developed, maintained, and monitored to provide minimum fireflow, rates peak-load capacity for fire suppression.

HS4D. Require remote hillside developments to maintain sufficient water supplies on site, when appropriate, to provide wildland fire protection. Water supplies may be stored in the form of ponds, storage tanks, or other features acceptable to the Fire Marshal.

HS4E. Utilize appropriate techniques, such as those illustrated in Figure 4-8, to reduce fire damage in those areas with a high wildland fire potential. The actual combination of these and/or other techniques required for a

HS4F. particular project will be determined by the Fire Marshal based on the level of hazard involved.

HS4G. Construct emergency-access routes to open-space areas at optimal locations within developments. al
Develop a comprehensive vegetation management and weed abatement program for open-space arcas, including those that are located existing subdivisions.

HS4H. Establish a program to construct and maintain fire-access roads in ravine areas considered to have a very high fire danger to enhance the ability to suppress wildland fires. These roads need not be surfaced and may also function as part of the City's trail system. Erosion and impacts to native vegetation and natural features shall be minimized.

HS4l. Amend subdivision regulations to ensure that cul -de-sac lengths are generally no greater than 600 feet and should have a sufficient turnaround area. Longer cul-de-sacs may be considered if additional measures are

HS4J. incorporated to ensure the safety of residents and emergency-response personnel.

HS4K. Amend subdivision regulations to ensure that residential subdivisions have at least two points of access.
Maintain and augment mitual and automatic aid agreements with the California Department of Forestry
(CDF) and Shasta County.

HS4L. Continue to promote fire prevention through education and public awareness programs.

IMPACTS

The urban area is subject to both urban and wildland fire hazards. Urban fire hazards could occur in any urban development, and wildland fire hazards are greatest along the western, eastern, and northern boundary of the urban area. These areas contain open space, residential, and public facility uses.

Redding Public Heuring General Plan Draft EIR 8-7 April 19, 2000

000005

Chapter 8: Health and Safety
New nonresidential buildings and multi-family structures are required by the Uniform Fire Code to incorporate sprinklers, fire-resistant building materials, and smoke detectors. City and county regulations require minimum roadway widths for fire access and the provision of fire hydrants in areas with public water service. The City also requires the establishment and maintenance of fire-safe buffers on new residential development in fire-prone areas.
The Redding General Plan contains several policies that would minimize wildland and urban fire hazards. Policy HS4A requires the maintenance of an Insurance Service Office (ISO) rating of 3 or better. Policy HS4D requires that remote hillside developments maintain sufficient water supplies on site to provide wildland fire protection. To provide urban fire protection, cul-de-sacs are to be no greater than 600 feet in length and have a sufficient turnaround area as required by Policy HS4I Policy HS4J requires each residential subdivision to have at least two points of access. Compliance with General Plan policies and .
existing Federal, State, County, and City regulations would ensure that all new development within the urban area meets industry construction standards for fire safety. Therefore, the urban and wildland fire hazard impacts related to development under the General Plan would be less than significant.

MITIGATION MEASURES
No mitigation measures beyond the policies of the General Plan and existing regulations are necessary.

8.3 FLOODING -- ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

Detailed information of flooding hazards can be found in Chapter 10 of the General Plan Background Report, and existing conditions are summarized below.
Development in flood-prone areas increases the severity of property damage associated with flooding. The volume of "space" in the floodplain occupied by development can no longer contain floodwaters, so the height of the flood would be higher under developed conditions. A related effect is that where floodwaters are flowing, the development and its effect of raising local flood elevation create a "backwater effect," raising water heights upstream. The more development there is, the greater this effect would be. G -
Development in a drainage basin can also raise flood elevation, even when the development is not in the floodplain, because development decreases the ability of the land in the basin to absorb rainfall by covering the land with impervious surfaces. This process causes runoff to reach streams, rivers, and floodplains sooner than would otherwise be the case. The concentration of stormwater runoff condensed into a shorter time period is equal to higher floodwater heights.
Floods in the urban area are likely to occur due to high levels of rainfall in short time periods. The runoff from these events can be calculated on the basis of drainage basin characteristics and storm intensity.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) formally designates areas located in probable flood hazard zones. Figure 8-3 shows the 100-year flood zones for the urban area. Most of the flooding information provided by FEMA was prepared in 1985, although data for several drainages have been updated since that time. Substantial development has occurred since that time, resulting in higher fload elevations on most major creek drainages than are reflected on the Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM). In 1993, the City undertook a comprehensive study of all major drainage basins in the County to determine what effect development has had on flood levels over the past eight-year period. The information is presented in the Citywide Master Storm Drain Study (CMSDS).

1.0 INTRODUCTION

People and property in Redding are at risk from a variety of hazards that have the potential for causing widespread loss of lives and damage to property, infrastructure, and the environment. Hazards are part of the world around us. Natural occurrences such as wildland fires, floods, winter storms, and earthquakes are inevitable and are natural phenomena which we cannot control. The occurrence of a natural hazard can result in damages and hardships for an entire community for many years following the event.

Disasters result when the man-made environment, such as buildings and Infrastructure, take place in areas subject to forces of nature. The frequency of disasters is rising at a substantial rate due to the fact that more and more people have chosen to live and work in locations that put them at risk.
The purpose of hazard mitigation is to implement and sustain actions that reduce vulnerability and risk from hazards or reduce the severity of the effects of hazards on people and property. Mitigation actions are both short-term and long-term activities which reduce the cause or occurrence of hazards; reduce exposure to hazards; or reduce effects of hazards through various means, Including preparedness, response, and recovery measures. Effective mitigation actions will also reduce the adverse impact and cost of future disasters.

The City of Redding Local Hazard Mitigation Plan includes resources and information to assist in planning for hazards. The plan provides a list of actions that may assist the City of Redding in reducing risk and preventing loss from future hazard events. The actions address hazards, as well as specific activitles for, Wildland Fire, Flood, Hazardous Material, Severe Winter Weather, Earthquakes, Utility Disruption, Aviation Disaster, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, Explosives (CBRNE), Dam Overflow or Failure, and Volcanic íssues.

3.0 OFFICIAL RECORD OF ADOPTION
This section provides a general and comprehensive view of the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000. This includes a review of the federal requirements, City adoption, and supporting documentation.

3.1 Disaster Mitigation Act 2000 Requirements
The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (DMA 2000), commonly known as the 2000 Stafford Act amendments, was approved by Congress on October 10, 2000. On October 30, 2000, the President
signed the bill into law, creating Public Law 106-390. DMA 2000 amended the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act by repealing the previous Mitigation Planning Section 409 and replacing it with a new Mitigation Planning Section 322. The DMA 2000 is the latest legislation to
improve the hazard mitigation planning process. The new legislation reinforces the importance of mitigation planning and emphasizes planning for disasters before they occur. As such, the DMA 2000 establishes a pre-disaster hazard mitigation program and new requirements for the national post-disaster Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP).
The DMA 2000 specifically addresses mitigation planning at the state and local levels. It identifies new requirements that allow HMGP funds to be used for planning activities and increases the amount of HMGP funds available to states that have developed a comprehensive, enhanced mitigation plan prior to a disaster. States and communities must have an approved mitigation plan in place prior to receiving post-disaster HMGP funds. Local and tribal mitigation plans must demonstrate that their proposed mitigation measures are based on a sound planning process that accounts for the risk to, and the
capabilities of, the individual communities.

State governments have certain responsibilities for implementing the program. DMA 2000 is intended to facilitate cooperation between state and local authorities, prompting them to work together. It encourages and rewards local and state pre-disaster planning and promotes sustainability as a strategy for disaster resistance. This enhanced planning network will better enable local and state governments to articulate accurate needs for mitigation, resulting in faster allocation of funding and more effective
risk-reduction projects.

4.0 BACKGROUND

4.1 Introduction

The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (DMA 2000), commonly known as the 2000 Stafford Act amendments, was approved by Congress on October 10, 2000. On October 30, 2000, the President signed the bill into law, creating Public Law 106-390, amending the Stafford Act with regard to hazard mitigation planning primarily by moving from post-disaster mitigation to pre-disaster mitigation planning and projects. The DMA 2000 emphasizes greater interaction between the state and federal governments, which have a continuing interest in streamlining the mitigation planning, implementation, and project-funding process.

4.2 Purpose and Authority of Plan
The City of Redding (City) Hazard Mitigation Plan's purpose is to fulfill the requirements of the DMA 2000, which calls for all communities to prepare mitigation plans. The plan includes resources and
information to assist City residents, public- and private-sector organizations, and others interested in particlpating in planning for hazards. The plan provides a list of mitigation activities that may assist the City in reducing risk and preventing loss from future hazard events.
Hazard mitigation is any action that reduces the effects of future disasters. It has been demonstrated that hazard mitigation is most effective when based on an inclusive, comprehensive, long-term plan that is developed before a disaster actually occurs. Hazard mitigation, along with preparedness, response, and recovery are the four phases of emergency management. Hazard mitigation is the only phase of
emergency management specifically dedicated to breaking the cycle of damage, reconstruction, and
repeated damage.
The DMA 2000. Section 322a-d, requires that local governments, as a condition of receiving federal disaster mitigation funds, have a mitigation plan that describes the process for identifying hazards, risks, and vulnerabilities; identifies and prioritizes mitigation actions; encourages the development of local mitigation; and provides technical support for those efforts. This mitigation plan serves to meet those requirements.

4.3 Plan Description
The City of Redding Hazard Mitigation Plan consists of the following primary sections:

Community

This section provides details of our community to provide sufficient background for the hazard profiles and risk assessments that are presented in subsequent chapters. This description includes regional setting, history, and government and includes information regarding the climate, population, demographics, and economy.

Vulnerability Assessment
Through this process, the project team identified and gathered corresponding data on all potential hazards that present a danger to the City and the adjacent surrounding area. The information gathered includes historical data on natural hazard events that have occurred in and near the City and what impacts these events had on residents and their property.

Risk Assessment

This section utilizes the information gathered through the vulnerability assessment process to determine what assets in the community will be affected by the hazard event. The inventory of assets includes people, housing units, critical facilities, special facilities, infrastructure, hazardous materials facilities, and commercial facilities. This data was compiled by assessing the potential impacts from each hazard using past events. The information in this section provides the City with information that outlines the full range of hazards the City may face and the potentii social impacts, damages, and economic losses.
Mitigation Strategy
This section identifies mitigation actions/measures and implementation strategies for the City. Additionally, this section provides a comprehensive strategy for addressing mitigation priorities. The mitigation measures include preventive actions, property-protection techniques, structural projects, natural resource-protection strategies, emergency services, and public education and awareness activities.

5.0 PLANNING PROCESS

This section describes the process in which the plan was developed. This includes the federal requirement followed by the City's actions applied to this process.

5.1 DMA 2000 Requirements
The table below summarizes the DMA 2000 requirements for documentation of the planning process.

Table 5-1
DMA 2000 Requirements - Planning Process
and Documentation Planning Process

Requires that there be an open public involvement process in the formation of the plan. This includes opportunities for the public to comment on the plan at
I REQUIREMENT all stages of its formation and the involvement of any neighboring communities,
§201.6(b) and interested agencies, or private and nonprofit organizations. This should also
| §201.6(c)(1) include a review of any existing plans or studies and incorporation of these if appropriate. Documentation of the planning process, including how the plan was prepared, who was involved in the process, and how the public was involved is essential.

A description of the planning process should include how the plan was prepared, who was involved in the planning process, and the tirneframe for preparing the plan.

The plan should document how the planning team was formed and the number and outcomes of the meetings the planning team held. Ideally, the local
EXPLANATION mitigation planning team is composed of local, state, and federal agency representatives, as well as community representatives, local business leaders, and educators.

in addition to the core team preparing the plan, it is it also important to Indicate
how the public (residents, businesses, and other interested parties) participated, including what means (e.g., Web pages, storefronts, toll-free phone lines) were made available to those who could not attend public forums
to voice concerns or provide input during the planning process.
A. Does the plan provide a description of how the plan was prepared? B. Does the plan indicate how the planning team was formed (including who
ELEMENT was involved)?
C. Does the plan indicate how the public was involved in the process? Does the planning process describe what means were made available to
those who could not attend public meetings to provide input?

5.2 Plan Development
The initial phase of the planning process was to identify a team leader and to establish a project team comprised of City agencies. Associate Planner Lily Toy and Deputy Fire Marshal John Kaylor served as the project team leaders and as the primary contact persons for the City. The project team was formed as an advisory group and as a task group to review and update the plan. Meeting dates were set on a bi-weekly basis. As done in the past, the project team solicited participation for the team. The project team invited interested parties, such as the local American Red Cross, the Shasta County Office of Emergency Services, and various City agencies not represented on the project team. Additionally, an invitation was made to members of the Shasta County Multi-Jurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Plan at their T Steering Committee meetings which were held between April 2010 and November 2010. The members
of the Shasta County Multi-Jurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Plan Steering Committee consisted of various
County agencies, responsible officials, and consultants (ENPLAN Environmental Scientists and Planners and Western Shasta Resource Conservation District). The members of the City of Redding Hazard Mitigation Project Team (HMPT) are listed in Table 5-2 below:

The update to the plan was initiated in May 2010. The project team participated in working independently reviewing and making revisions for specific portions of the Plan. Interested parties and/or stakeholders were involved in reviewing and updating the goals, objectives and actions. The project team reviewed the Shasta County Multi-Jurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Pian, the City's General Plan,
and the City's Flood Inundation/Evacuation Plan to incorporate information and ensure consistency with other existing plans. The project team held monthly meetings through May 2011. Bi-weekly meetings were held from February 2012 until the draft plan was circulated for public review in September 2012. During the review period, the stakeholders were allowed opportunities to review the goals, objectives and actions and maps of the analyzed hazard scenarios developed by the project team. Following the review
period, the project team re-assessed and re-identified characteristics and potential consequences of natural and non-natural hazards affecting the City. With the understanding of the risks posed by the identified hazards, the team determined priorities and assessed various methods to avoid or minimize
any undesired effects. As a result, mitigation strategy and goals were updated. The team then went on to revised the implementation and monitoring plan in which the plan will be implemented through various hazard mitigation projects, changes in day-to-day City operations, and through continued hazard mitigation development.

5.3 Community Participation
Public input during the development of the mitigation plan update assisted in shaping plan goals and mitigations. The HMPT invited various stakeholders to the regularly scheduled meetings and held a separate stakeholders workshop to help identify priorities in developing goals for reducing risk and preventing loss from natural and non-natural hazards in the City. Press releases were issued to invite the public to the public workshop. When the draft was completed, a 20-day public comment period was initiated. A public notice was placed in the local newspaper to invite the public to review and comment on the draft plan. Copies of the plan were made available at the local library and at City Hall. Furthermore, a draft of the plan was posted on the City's website. The draft plan updates were presented to the City Council on November 6, 2012 and September 16, 2014, which were open to the public for further comment.

5.4 Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Benefits
During the process of developing the plan, benefits were realized. The following is a list of the beneflts that were generated during development of the plan.

1. Allowed for an in-depth analysis of current Hazardous Materials Facilitles in the City and the potential effects of a release of Hazardous Material.

2. Provided the City with a thumbprint view of where those facilitles are located and what chemical hazards they have on-site.

3. Provided for the sharing of information and team building between City departments.

4. Gave the City a beginning point for discussions on transportation hazards and how to effectively deal with one should it occur. "Plan for the worst, hope for the best."

5. Heightened our awareness level as to the nature of disasters in our community.

6. Provided an evaluation tool on our current resources and how to best utilize them in an emergency.

7. Allowed the City to practice the plan for scenario responses and mitigation measures on some of
the disasters.

8. Provided more up-to-date informational maps on specific hazards and facility locations.

9. Provided better methodology for quickly calculating property loss, number of affected structures,
and population.

10. Enhanced the City of Redding Emergency Preparedness Program.

6.0 COMMUNITY DESCRIPTION *

This section is to provide a glimpse into the community of Redding. This includes general Information concerning regional setting, history, government, climate, population, economy, land use, and
development patterns.

6.1 Regional Setting
The is in City of Redding is located in Shasta County in northern California, nestled between the Cascades and Trinity Alps. It is approximately 100 miles south of the Oregon border and 160 miles north of Sacramento. Redding's current population is approximately 90,200, which makes it the largest city in Shasta County and the largest city in California north of Sacramento. Redding also serves as the county seat of Shasta County.
Redding is situated at the far northern end of the Sacramento Valley, at the point where the valley meets the foothills of the Cascade mountain range. Elevations range from 500 to 5,000 feet above mean sea level. The City's mean elevation is 557 feet above mean sea level. Redding is surrounded by mountains to the west, north, and east. The most distinctive geographical feature In the area is the Sacramento
River, which meanders nine miles through the City in a general north-south direction. Several creeks
also run through the City from the west and east. These creeks function as tributaries to the Sacramento River. Some have carved gullies and ravines with depths of up to 200 in feet, mainly in the western part of the City. This stretch of river is one of the finest trout-fishing waters in the western United States.

Redding ls bisected by Interstate 5, a major north-south freeway that runs from Canada to Mexico. Interstate 5 connects Redding with major metropolitan areas such as Seattle, Portland, Sacramento, and Los Angeles. State Routes 299, 273, and 44 also pass through Redding, connecting the City with the Pacific Coast and Nevada. The main north-south line of the Union Pacific Railroad runs through the community as well. Redding's location also places it near it many outdoor attractions and recreational
areas, such as Shasta Lake, Lassen Volcanic National Park, and the Shasta/Trinity/Whiskeytown
National Recreation Area.

Redding was founded in 1872 and incorporated in 1887 at the northern terminus of the California and Oregon Railroad. The City's early growth was stimulated by the railroad and by the move of the county seat from Shasta in 1884. Mining played a major role in the economic life of Redding as the century progressed. In 1938, the beginning of construction of Shasta Dam provided another stimulus to growth in Redding. The construction boom after World War II boosted the lumber industry, which became the
mainstay of Redding's economy. In more recent years, retail trade, construction, and tourism have
become more significant activities as the lumber industry has declined. Redding has become a major regional center for shopping, health care, education, and government. As a result of a this, the Redding area has become one of the faster-growing areas in California.

6.2 History
In 1843, Pierson B. Reading, one of the pioneers of the lumber industry in Shasta County, and his
partner received a Spanish land grant for 26,000 acres near the Sacramento River. He built a home and
settied in, also planting the state's first cotton plants and northern California's first grapevines. By 1862,
he had mapped out a town near the mouth of Clear Creek and the Sacramento River. Redding was
founded in 1872; the year the "California and Oregon Railroad" reached the site of the City, which was to be its northern terminus for the next 12 years. The coming of the railroad saw the rise of Redding, along
with the decline of Shasta, the "Queen City" of northern California and, in the 1870's, the largest settlement in that part of the state. Shasta did not have a railroad, so business activity swung to
Redding. With the railroad came man named Benjamin Redding, who was a land agent for the Central Pacific Railroad. With the development of the town, the legislature wanted to name the town Reading after its founder. The railroad was not happy with this choice and would not recognize the name. It wanted the town named after its agent, Benjamin Redding. Finally in 1880, everyone gave in and the town was given the railroad's choice of names. At that time, there were 9,492 residents in Redding. By 1884, Redding had become the county seat of Shasta County. Redding was incorporated on October 4, 1887, the same year that the Southern Pacific Railroad came to Redding.

Since its incorporation in 1887, the area within the city limits of Redding has grown from 3.65 square miles to 60.03 square miles. The original City town site as plated in 1872 established the town limits at North (now Eureka Way), South, East, and West Streets. Redding's early growth was spurred by copper and gold strikes during the late 1800s, which led to an initial boom period between 1890 and 1910. By 1890, Redding's boundary had grown to the Sacramento River on the north, Sequoia Street on the east, Grant Street on the south, and Almond Street on the west. In the 1940s, initial development north of the
river and residential development moving toward the south occurred. In the 1950s, Initial development of the area along North Market Street occurred. With the opening of the Interstate 5 freeway, development
spread to the north. Interstate 5 continued to spur development along its corridor during the 1970s.
On January 1, 1970, the City was comprised of 15.2 square miles. Two significant annexations occurred in 1976 that dramatically altered the size and configuration of Redding. In June 1976, the Cascade Community Services District was annexed, adding 3,000 acres to the City south of town. Later, in December, the former Enterprise Public Utility District was annexed, adding another 3,200 acres east of These two annexations increased Redding's size by nearly 10 square miles. The largest town.
annexation since 1976 was the Texas Springs/Oregon Gulch annexation, which added 1,692 acres on
the west side to the City. With a few smaller annexations and one de-annexation occurring since, the City is now comprised of 60.68 square miles.

6.3 Government

The City of Redding is a general law city, formed under state legislative statutes and governed by a body of laws in the State Constitution. The Redding City Council consists of five council members elected "at large" for staggered four-year terms. Council members must be residents of the City and registered voters both at the time nomination papers are taken out and upon assuming office.
Redding is one of the many California cities operating under the Council-Manager form of government. Under this system, the Council establishes the policies under which the City operates and appoints a trained and experienced City Manager to administer the affairs of the City. His responsibilities include hiring of City staff, preparation of the annual budget, administration and coordination of the City's operations, general supervision over all property under the control of the City, and enforcement of City ordinances and applicable state laws.

The City Manager appoints a staff to assist him in carrying out his duties. City departments include Administrative Services, City Attorney's office, City Clerk's office, City Treasurer's office, Community Services, Development Services, Electric, Fire, Human Resources, Municipal Services, Support Services, and Police.

Like the City Manager, the City Attorney is appointed by the City Council. Both the City Clerk and the City Treasurer are elected by the public.

Redding is a full-service city with approximately 1,000 full- and part-time employees. The City's services include:

Airport
General Administrative Services
Highways and Streets
Housing
Planning and Zoning

6.6 Economy

The outdoor lifestyle and air quality of the Redding area have attracted many highly skilled people from larger urban areas, creating a choice labor force. Both Money Magazine and Expansion Management Magazine have recognized the Shasta County metro area for its quality business environment.
Redding's overall job growth in a five-year period was more than double the national average (19.9 percent compared with 8.7 percent). The increase in the number of businesses in the City is almost triple the national average (38.8 percent compared with 13 percent) for the same period.
Redding also offers an extremely successful Down Payment Assistance Program to aid first-time homebuyers. Affordable commercial and residential real estate, low-cost skilled labor, and a low crime rate also contribute to Redding's rapid growth.

Vinae City of Redding Local Hazard Mitigalion Plan
-

One of the key components of Shasta County's business retention plan is to acknowledge and cater to small businesses; particularly those that help create a diverse economy with industrial Jinkages between local manufacturers. The Redding City Council has developed a number of local incentives for industrial
development and businesses that create new jobs.

The Shasta Metro Enterprise Zone consists of 51 square miles of commercial and industrial sectors of the cities of Redding, Anderson, and Shasta Lake, as well as adjacent industrial areas of Shasta County. Special incentives offered by the Enterprise Zone include sales and tax credit, hiring assistance, business expense deduction, net operating loss carryover, and net interest deductions for lenders.
Occupations in Redding include:

Agriculture
Construction
Finance
Government
Manufacturing
Retail Trade
Services
Transportation, Commercial, Utilitles
Wholesale Trade

6.7 Land Uses

Redding adopted its first General Plan In 1958. The Plan Area covered 9,366 acres, or 14.6 square miles, consisting of a land use diagram and a streets and highways plan, and included five land use classifications: Single Family, High Density Residential/Professional, Retail Commercial, Planned Industrial, and Public. By contrast, the General Plan adopted in 1970 covered approximately 73 square miles. The current General Plan, adopted in 2000, covers approximately 110 square miles and includes 23 land use designations. The residential land uses encompass approximately 37,000 acres. The nonresidential land uses encompass approximately 35,000 acres. The non-residential land uses include office, commercial, heavy commercial, industrial, public facilities/institutional, airport service, greenway, park, and recreation.

6.8 Development Patterns
While in part the result of topography, flood-prone land and physical barriers (such as the Sacramento River, Interstate 5, and the Union Pacific Railroad), the relatively low-density, discontinuous nature of Redding's development pattern does not come without its costs. These Include increased costs of providing public services; loss of community identity, or "sense of place"; decreased air quality due to a near total reliance on the automobile; and a neglect of older, established residential neighborhoods and commercial areas in preference for development in new areas.
Few cities have the luxury of sole control over all land uses contained within them. and Redding is no exception. Redding has grown geographically through the annexation of lands which were formerly outside its jurisdictional control. In fact, some of the larger annexations (e.g., Enterprise and Cascade areas) added not only significant territory to the City, but also increased its population base and level of development as well. In part, this helps to explain why there seems to be no organizing principle

underlying Redding's urban structure. It also serves to explain the lack of consistency in infrastructure improvements, landscape, and building design, as well as lack of public-street access to individual properties found in various parts of the City.

Redding can be divided into five primary sectors, each of which is shaped by its unique characteristics, historles. and issues. These areas are: (1) Central and West Redding, (2) East Redding (Enterprise), (3) Dana Drive and Northeast Redding, (4) North Redding, and (5) South Redding.

Central and West Redding

Central Redding is the location of the City's original commercial and office core. Local government facilities and most of its older residential districts are also located here. Spreading outward from the original town site astride the railroad in a grid pattern typical of the time, Redding grew north and east to the edge of the bluff that borders the Sacramento River, south along the highway and railroad spine, and
west into the hills and gullies. Extension of the early street pattern across the ravines created unusable lots and "paper" streets that remain undeveloped today.
Some of the City's most unique and historic residential areas are located west of Central Redding in the Magnolla neighborhood and its adjacent neighborhoods. Farther west, beyond Benton Airpark and the now-closed Benton Sanitary Landfill, lays a large, residential district, consisting exclusively of single-family subdivisions. Development of some of these areas began in the early 1950s and new developments continue to be constructed today.
West Redding is not only home to some of the City's more popular neighborhoods, but is also home to Mercy Medical Center and numerous doctors' office complexes and professional offices. Until such time
as Downtown redevelopment occurs or additional multiple-family sites are identified, Central and West Redding will have a significant imbalance in available housing opportunities.
With the construction of Interstate 5, most new commercial investment was directed to locations other than Central Redding. The expansion of county government offices, Redding Medical Center, and Mercy Medical Center also promoted office construction along Court, Oregon, and West Streets, displacing older residential uses.

Downtown Redding remains an important area, even though it was bypassed by the construction of Interstate 5, encouraging most new retail development to locate east of the river. All other major traffic arteries converge downtown, which contributes to its viability. Recent efforts, including redevelopment projects to improve the appearance and pedestrian orientation of Downtown streets, demonstrate the community's commitment to maintaining and enhancing the unique character of the heart of the community. The development of the Turtle Bay Museum and Arboretum by the Sacramento River and the Civic Center will serve to emphasize the importance of the City's core area.
East Redding (Enterprise)
Development in the Enterprise area occurred almost entirely in the postwar years. Early subdivisions were located along Old Highway 44 (now known as Cypress Avenue), Churn Creek Road, and Hartnell Avenue. Subsequent development has taken place both to the north up to the new State Route 44 and
to the south into the Churn Creek Bottom area. The street pattern in some older residential areas is
poor, with long, dead-end streets and offset intersections. A lack of adequate subdivision regulations in the early days of development permitted the creation of large, deep lots surrounded by smaller lots and
21

000033

GINDA City of Redding Local Hazard Mitigation Plan
**** =

hundreds of landlocked parcels that can be reached only by private roads or by access drives across other properties. This lot pattern makes further development very inefficient and difficult and necessitates providing new, costly streets and Infrastructure.
Like the residential areas, commercial development in the Enterprise area originally occurred in a haphazard manner along Otd Highway 44, Bechelli Lane, and Hartnell Avenue and at freeway interchanges. Access to many stores in these locations is poor, and the nature of this strip-type development-with each establishment having its own parking lot and driveway-precludes parking once and visiting several businesses. The construction of Interstate 5 had a noticeable impact on commercial a growth at the north end of this area along Hilltop Drive and other easily accessible locations. Service stations, motels, restaurants, and other uses that seek readily visible sites and easy freeway access can be found in this area. This area continues to develop with commercial uses, which can now be found along Churn Creek Road as well. Two overpasses across State Route 44 connect this area to the newly expanding Dana Drive regional commercial hub and to an expanding residential area to the northeast.
Dana Drive and Northeast Redding

Following the construction of Interstate 5, a noticeable pattern of commercial development, together with
additional suburban residential growth, has occurred north of State Route 44 along Dana Drive. Additional growth has also occurred along the northern extension of Churn Creek Road and eastward
along Oid Alturas Road. Commercial development largely commenced with the Mt. Shasta Mall, which Is
located at the northeast corner of Hilltop Drive and Dana Drive. Subsequent regional commercial development has since spread eastward to Victor Avenue. In conjunction with commercial activities, residential development flourished to the north on Churn Creek Road and to the east on Old Alturas Road. The Dana Drive Benefit District and the Churn Creek Road Overcrossing Assessment District
were formed in order to provide infrastructure for this newly established regional commercial hub.
All signs indicate that the available vacant commercial land in this area will be built out by the year 2020. In 2000, the City saw the expansion of the Mt. Shasta Mall. The Mall expansion spurred large regional commercial-store developers to develop within the Dana Drive area. Vehicle traffic in this area has increased significantly, which has necessitated the upgrade and improvement of the streets and intersections.

North Redding
Like Enterprise, the North Redding area, extending from Keswick Dam to Shasta College, includes a scattering of residential and commercial development. Along North Market Street, formerly Highway 99, Redding's "Miracle Mile" is lined with a variety of motel, restaurant, retail, and auto-sales establishments. Adjoining lowlands to the west have been developed with residential subdivisions and affordable housing units. Lake Redding-Caldwell Park extends along the north bank of the river on each side of the railroad trestle. This major recreation area has picnicking, playground, swimming, and other facilities.
Lake Boulevard is the main artery of the Buckeye area, a major portion of which was annexed to the City in 1969. Strip commercial development is strung along Lake Boulevard, and there is scattered residential development in the area. Landlocked parcels are common, with heavy dependence on private roads for access. Mobile homes are a major residential type here, both in mobile home parks and on individual lots. The pattern of small ownership and prevalence of mobile homes in some areas may tend to discourage subdivision activity, particularly on the northern fringe of the Planning Area along
Oasis Road.

South Redding
Much of the development of South Redding came after World War II, when subdivision activity expanded into the lower elevations and along the Anderson-Cottonwood Irrigation District Canal (ACID). Scattered developments also sprang up in the Live Oak-Bonnyview (Cascade) area to the south and along ridge tops in the southwestern part of the Planning Area. Also to the south, the old principal traffic artery---Old Highway 99 (now known as State Route 273)-became a commercial strip lined with an assortment of motels, truck stops, and service stations; industrial and distribution establishments; and local retail services. As a commercial gateway to the City, this area has largely become obsolete in design and
function.

Several recent residential developments have occurred in the area, including the Rivercrest Estates
Subdivision, as well as new developments south of Girvan Road. The latter developments have led to a reduction in the pastoral setting that was until recently prevalent in the area.

7.0 RISK ASSESSMENT

The section identifies the hazards that might affect the City of Redding, profiles the major hazards, assesses the risk of such hazards, describes the City's vulnerability, and estimates potential losses from
the hazards.

7.1 DMA 2000 Requirements
The overall DMA 2000 requirements for the risk assessment are shown in Table 7-1. The requirements mandate that only natural disasters are addressed, however, the City has included the most significant human-caused hazards in this plan.

Table 7-1
Risk Assessment - Overall

REQUIREMENT
§201.6(c)(2) Local risk assessment must provide sufficient information to enable the jurisdiction to identify and prioritize appropriate mitigation actions to reduce losses from identified hazards. This includes detailed descriptions of all the
hazards that could affect the jurisdiction, along with an analysis of the
jurisdiction's vulnerability to those hazards. Specific information about numbers and types of structures, potential dollar losses, and an overall description of land use trends in the jurisdiction must be Included in this
analysis.

EXPLANATION The local risk assessment should identify what hazards are likely to affect the area. The plan should describe the sources used to identify hazards, noting any data limitatio and provide an explanation for eliminating any hazards
from consideration. The process for identifying hazards could involve one or
more of the following:
Reviewing reports, plans, flood ordinances, and land use regulations
among others.
Talking to experts from federal, state, and local agencies and universities.
Searching the Internet and newspapers.
Interviewing long-time residents.

7.2 Identify and Screen Hazards
The City of Redding HMPT identified several hazards that are addressed in the plan. These hazards include natural and human-caused hazards that might affect persons and property in the City. The hazards were ranked based on the initial analysis. Twelve hazards were found to be either significant hazard or less significant hazard and are ranked for hazard mitigation planning. These hazards were
identified through public input, researching past disasters, and risk assessments included in the City
Emergency Operations and General Plan.

7.3 Loss Estimation

FEMA requires that an estimation of loss be conducted for the identilled hazards. Loss estimation was conducted on the Identifled signIncant hazards (refer to Table 7-3). FEMA requires the "Vulnerability Analysis" to include the number of potential structures impacted by these hazards and the total polantial costs. These estimates were determined by utlizing Geographic Information System (GIS) overlay analysis software and toals. Existing GIS data layers, such as parcels, were overlaid with theoretical hazard boundary extents. Then, using GIS overlay analysis software; items such as the number and value of structures affected by the hazard were calculated and reported.

7.4 Wildland Fire

7,4.1 Nature

Hills and mountains surround the westerly portion of the Clty of Redding, which is covered mostly with grasses, brush, Manzanita, oak trees, and gray pines. The climate in this area is generally referred to as "Mediterranean," with rainfall concentrated during the cool winter months. The rains usually cease sometime in April and resume in November.
Summer drought causes vegetation to become extremely dry, and a regional weather phenomenon, the northerly winds. can aggravate an already very hazardous fire situation. The hillside areas of the
western portion of the City have, therefore, been classified as a very high fire hazard severity zone. With extreme dryness, relative humidity often 10 percent or less, high temperatures over 100 degrees, and 20 to 40 mph winds, a wildfire can become uncontrolled, spreading through vegetative fuels and
exposing and possibly consuming structures.
The fires often begin unnoticed, spreading very quickly, and are usually signaled by dense smoke that fills the air in the immediate area.

Wildfires are ignited 90 percent of the time by human action. Over one-third of all wildland fires originate alongside roads and highways, probably as a result of equipment failure or cigarettes or matches being thrown by passing automobiles. Despite the rising penalties, approximately 22 percent of all fires recorded statewide result from an act of arson. Other causes of wildfires include the following:
Approximately 23 percent of all wildfires that burn over 5,000 acres are caused by power-line failures. Wildfires can also be ignited by sparks from off-road vehicles, construction equipment, and other power- driven equipment used for residential or recreational purposes. In the developed areas, wildfires can start from children playing with matches, unattended recreational fires, equipment use, and sparks from chimneys. Natural causes, primarily lightning, are now relatively minor for most local disastrous fires.
The following three factors contribute significantly to wildland fire behavior:
Topography: As slope increases, the rate of wildland fire spread increases. South-facing slopes are also subject to greater solar radiation, making them drier and thereby intensifying wildland fire behavior. However, ridge tops may mark the end of wildland fire spread, since fire spreads more slowly or may even be unable to spread downhill unless wind-driven.
Fuel: Weight and volume are the two methods of classifying fuel, with volume also referred to fuel loading (measured in tons of vegetation material per acre). Each fuel is assigned a bumn index (the estimated amount of potential energy released during a fire), an estimate of the effort required to contain a wildfire and an expected flame length. The fuel's continuity is also an important factor, both horizontally and vertically.

27

000039

traR City of Redding Hazard Mitigation Plan
= -

• Weather: Variation on weather conditions has a significant effect on the occurrences and behavior of wildfires. Short-term conditions, such as high heat, low humidity and high winds, facilitate the ignition and rapid spread of fires. Conversely, cool temperatures, high humidity and little to no wind
reduce the risk of wildfires and allow fires to be contained more readily. Long-term conditions, such as prolonged droughts, also play a major role in fire susceptibility.
Other factors increase the wildfire hazard. These include dense vegetation growth and large accumulation of dead plant materials in areas that have not been mitigated or burned for many years. Steep terrain compounds the wildfire risk because fires normally burn much faster uphill. Rugged terrain also hinders fire-suppression attempts by hampering the mobility effectiveness of firefighters and equipment.
If not promptly controlled, wildland fires may grow into an emergency or disaster. Firestorms occur during extreme weather with such intensity that fire suppression is virtually impossible. These events
typically burn until the conditions change or the fuel ls exhausted. Even small fires can threaten lives and resources and destroy improved properties.
It is also important to in note that in addition to affecting people, wildland fires may severely affect livestock and pets. Such events may require the emergency watering/feeding, sheltering, evacuation, and even
burying of animals.

7.4.2 Effects of Wildfires

Wildfires generally have the most impact on the natural environment. Although some ecosystems are dependent upon recurrent fire to survive, these communities are unique. Watershed, wildlife, and recreational areas are lost due to wildfire. After the fire has been extinguished, the burned land is laid bare of its protective vegetation cover and is susceptible to excessive runoff and erosion. The fire will often destroy the root system of shrubs and grasses that aid in stabilizing slope material. When the
winter rains come, the possibility of landslide and debris/mud flows are greatly increased.
The impacts of wildfire often strain public resources, including emergency response and utilitles. Water reserves are drawn down, power lines become disabled, telephone service can be disrupted, roads can be blocked, etc. Flood-control facilities may be inadequate to handle the increased storm-runoff debris
from barren and burned hills.

integration of five fire determinants (human proximity, vegetation, access, slope, and wind direction) has delineated two natural fire hazard potential zones for the City of Redding. Very high fire hazard severity
risk areas lie to the immediate west of central Redding and north and northeast Redding, with Manzanita, buck brush, and other highly combustible vegetation, along with steep 20 to 40 percent slope, and somewhat limited access. The medium to low risk areas lie in the vicinity of developed property with grass and scattered oak over more level to gentle (flat to 20 percent) slope and with available access.
Areas not threatened by fire risk are within developed areas with cultivated urban cover and available
urban access.

28

CRORY City of Redding Hazard Mitigation Plan

7.4.3 Wildland Urban Interface (WUI)
Wildland Urban Interface a (WUI) fires are a significant hazard. In a study conducted by the U.S. Fire Administration in 2002, the history of urban interface fires, which have caused significant property loss, was discussed, with one of the most destructive fires occurring in the State of California with the 1991 WUI fire in the East Bay Hills of Oakland, in which 25 lives were lost and more than 3,000 structures destroyed. Fire crews were overwhelmed and the fire destroyed, for the most part, everything in its path.

In general, wildfire is not a major threat in the flat, developed areas of Redding when adequate emergency resources are available. However, fire a is a major problem in the fringe-urban and hill areas on the west side of Redding and those additional areas, approximately 39 percent, of the City that are
identified as very high fire severity zone. This increased risk is due primarily to a predominance of the north-facing slopes that are characteristically more vegetated than those of the southern aspect. Within the west side, the highest fire risk areas are located in the hilly populated regions. All major determinants of fire risk point to this area as the most critical area for the City of Redding.
The City of Redding has numerous subdivisions on the west side of town which are built on ridge tops with significant fuels with valleys and ravines in alignment with prevailing summer winds which results in a significant fire risk to the community. is This is further compounded by the hot, dry, and Jow humidity levels experienced in Redding during the summer, along with wind events that can result in rapid fire growth and spread.

Once a fire starts, it is influenced by several factors, including fuels, topography, weather, drought, and development, along with the ability to quickly access and contain the fire. The combined conditions are key elements which affect the risk and severity of the fire.
The major risk involves loss of lives and property which lie in those developed areas identified as in the very high fire severity zones. Here property damage is not an uncommon occurrence. These interfacing and transitional areas are constantly vulnerable. As development extends more and more into the areas identified as very high fire severity zones, the situation becomes increasingly acute.

7.4.4 History
Within the last 15 years, there have been significant fires in Shasta County n which the City of Redding is contrally oriented. These fires have destroyed well over 1,700 structures and, in some cases, have threatened the City. The more significant fires are included in the following table:

In the last 10 years in Shasta County, there were approximately 3,186 vegetation fires which burned a total of 77,195 acres of land, causing approximately $66,475,700 in property loss. It is important to note that 53 percent of the vegetation fires were caused by equipment use, such as the blade of a mower striking a rock and causing a spark or hot engine exhaust from a mower, which would ignite dry grass.
The second leading cause of vegetation fires is arson.
The City of Redding experiences close to over 150 wildland fires each year, which have been destructive to our community.

7.4.5 Future Events

Given the topography, climate and vegetation on the west side of Redding, it is ripe and conducive to having fast-spreading wildfires. According to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and as shown on Shasta County's Fire Hazard Map, all the hillsides in west Redding are located within
the very high fire hazard severity zone, including areas to the north and east of town. The history of the
wildfire activity in Shasta County is traumatic, and we will continue to be faced with wiidland fires that
threaten lives and property every summer.

The wildland risk to the City of Redding can be attributed to three factors. The first are the ignition sources, the second is the fuel loading, and the third is resources available to address fires. Mitigation must address reducing the fuel-ignition sources, such as juveniles playing with matches and lighters in the open vegetated areas, transient populations occupying areas within the urban interface and utilizing fire, educating the public on better abatement procedures when using mechanical equipment, and disposing properly of cigarettes. The second is reducing the immediate fuel load surrounding the urbanized area within and around the City of Redding on public and private property. The third Is adequate staffing and equipment for handling emergency incidents.
The risks associated with future events will continue to increase as the City sees development on previously approved projects In the very high fire hazard severity zone and as new developments are proposed and constructed.

7.4.6 Present and Future Mitigation Efforts
The City has over the last 16 years abated over 749 acres of brush behind homes in the very high fire hazard severity zone on public property. Continuation of fuel-reduction mitigation must continue throughout the very high fire hazard severity zone on both public and private lands.
The City also maintains an Emergency Operations Center to help coordinate information and resources for any type of disaster or threat. Yearly ongoing training, updating of critical information, and drills are conducted to help protect people and property.
All new subdivisions have been approved using the new General Plan regulations and Building and Fire Code adoptions, including residential sprinkler requirements which help mitigate the spread of fire from a residential fire incident to the WUI area. In addition, this may also include one or more of the following: (1) adequate defensible space and development of landscape maintenance districts to maintain defensible space, (2) utilizing noncombustible construction on the exterior, (3) providing two ways in and out, and (4) meeting fire-flow requirements in accordance with the California Fire Code.
7.4.7 Vulnerability:
The City of Redding recently ran a fire scenario on the west side, which was derived from an actual fire occurrence in the area. As a result of the fire-scenario information, it was discovered that 17 percent of all structures in the City could be affected by this fire, with a potential dollar loss of $135,300,000. This fire would be 10,250 acres in size and displace approximately 13,437 people (See Figure 6).

2014 Plan Evaluation

Review of the implementation of the 2005 plan allowed the opportunity to review the Plan's goals, objectives and identified actions to determine their relevance and current status. Prior to the initiation of the 2014 plan update process, little evaluation of the plan was conducted, primarily due to the economic downturn and its impact onto City staffing. As the plan was evaluated during the update process, the following was determined:
78 of the 96 identifled 2005 actions are ongoing; 9 of the 18 identified non-ongoing 2005 actions were successfully completed; and
• 10 additional unidentified actions were successfully completed.
As a part of the 2014 Update, a review of a development within hazard prone areas was performed to determine their impact since the adoption of the plan in 2005. The table below list development that has occurred in hazard prone areas since the adoption of the plan and identifies which hazard prone area and its vulnerability,

Type of Development Hazard Vulnerability
Single Family Homes Fire No impact to vulnerability. Homes have been allowed to be
constructed in the very high fire severity zone; however their vulnerability is mitigated with the adoption of recent building
codes which require the installation of fire sprinklers. Various Development Flood No impact to vulnerability. All development within a
designated flood plain is subject to the City's adopted Flood Plain Regulations which are more stringent than the National Flood Insurance Program's mandated regulations for a Community Rating System Class 6 community. Clover Creek Detention Flood Decreased vulnerability. This was designed as a regional
Basin detention facility and decreases the vulnerability of flooding
along Churn Creek.

9.3 Implementation Through Existing Programs
The City of Redding currently utilizes comprehensive land use planning, capital improvements planning, building codes and fire codes to guide and regulate development. The City of Redding addresses statewide planning goals and legislative requirements through these various programs. The Local Hazard Mitigation Plan provides a series of actions, many a of which are closely related to the goals and objectives of these existing planning programs. The Steering Committee is responsible for determining how each individual action will be implemented through existing programs. After the City officially adopts the Plan, these existing mechanisms will have hazard mitigation strategies integrated into them. The Emergency Services Coordinator will ensure incorporation of hazard mitigation strategies during the periodic reviews of the City's comprehensive plans and land use pollcies.

Capital Improvement Plan

in The action items in the mitigation plan may be achieved through activities recommended in the Capital Improvement Plan (CIP). The CIP is updated every five years. Upon review of the CIP, the Steering Committee will work with the City's Public Works Department to identify areas where the hazard mitigation action items are consistent with CIP goals and integrate them where appropriate.

Date of last revision: 2014
Plan owner: Development Services Department Plan description: The Capital Improvement Plan is a planning document that identifies capital projects in the next five-year horizon for elected officials, citizens, and staff.
Hazard mitigation priorities will be considered during the CIP process.
Plan cycle: Five-year cycle Relation to hazard mitigation: Action items may be inserted Into the Captial Improvement Plan as approved by the City Council.
After formal adoption of the Hazard Mitigation Plan, the action items in the Plan in will be incorporated into existing plans as is practical. The meetings of the Steering Committee will provide an opportunity for committee members to report back on the progress made on the integration of mitigation planning elements into City planning documents and procedures.
In addition to the Capital Improvement Plan, various other existing plans, policies, and programs have hazard mitigation ties. The Steering Committee will identify how best to implement individual actions into the appropriate existing plan, policy, or program, The following existing plans, policies, and programs were identified by the Steering Committee.

General Plan

Date of last revision: 2013
Plan owner: Planning Division Plan description: The City's General Plan is a guide for growth. The General Plan outlines where the City wants to be and how to get there. It is an action plan for the City.
The Plan reflects the values of the community. These values are the common thread that link the goals, policies, and implementation measures of the Plan. The General Plan Diagram is part of this document. Plan cycle: The General Plan changes when the needs and desires of the public change, when development occurs at a different rate than predicted, and when corrections in a
plan are needed, the plan needs to be revised.
Relation to hazard mitigation: The Hazard Mitigation Plan mission statement and goals should be cohesive with and align with the mission and goals of the City's General Plan.

The Sacramento River and the corridors along our craeks endow this area with a natural, open quality not always found in urban settings. Access ?
to these open spaces is still possible i many parts of the community where wooded slopes and streams have been protected.
The existence of these special areas - parks, trails, and open spaces - set aside and maintained for recreation and natural resource preservation, demonstrate that our City has the capacity to think big and to attract broad support from ciltizens, state legislators, philanthropic foundations, and from national organizations. We have many accomplishments for which we are proud.
However, as our population grows and as we bulld more houses, offices, and stores, a clear and coordinated park and open space plan must
accompany development if we are to enjoy a high quality of life and preserve areas for recreation.

The Parks, Trails, and Open Space Master Plan was first adopted in 2004 and is the result of a two-year effort by the City with input from its citizens PURPOSE AND SCOPE

to create a long-range plan for recreational sites and community open spaces. To ensure that the various park, trail, and open space inventorles are up to date and that the various strategies and policies contained in the Master Plan remain relevant, this document was thoroughly reviewed and updated between 2017 and 2018.

First and foremost, the Master Plan is an implementation tool of Redding's 2000-2020 General Plan. Three policies fram that document create the IMPLEMENTING THE GENERAL PLAN

1. Recreation Policy R4A directs the City to develop and implement the 2004 Park, Trails, and Open Space Master Plan so that suitable sites for springboard for the Plan's major components:

public parks and other recreational features can be identified and acquired well in advance of their actual need.
2. Recreation Policy R11A calls for utilization of the trail system plan of the Parks, Trails, and Open Space Master Plan to locate future trails that link neighborhoods to other land uses and significant destination points, separate bicyclists, and pedestrians from vehicular traffic, and provide continuous trail connections and a looped system around the city.
3. Finally, Natural Resources Policy NR11A directs the City to utilizo the Parks, Trails, and Open Spaco Master Plan to establish a framework for open
space lands, preservation of important ecological areas, and facilitate acquisition and management of public open space ands.
By combining these related subjects into one Integrated planning effort, the Master Plan creates e comprehensive vision and action plan for those areas held in common by the City for public recreation and preservation.

The first section of the Master Plan is the Park Strategy, where we recognize the many achievements over the years. The recently updated inventory PARKS: RECOGNIZING OUR ACHIEVEMENTS

shows an impressive number of sites where Redding residents can recreate, compete, and celebrate.
With 30 playgrounds, play fields, a skate park, horseshoe pits, an extensive trail system, a roller hockey rink, a riverfront fish viewing area, natural area parks, three boat ramps, two water playgrounds, a competitive swim facility, a sports park and soccer facility, Redding is now home to a truly varied and inclusive recreation network.
MAJOR PARK AND RECREATION ISSUES
With these accomplishments, however, several significant issues also challenge us:
RECREATION FACILITIES. At the top of the list is the need for sufflclent recreation facillties. Publlc and community-based sports providers indicate that there is an unmet demand for more gymnasiums and sports fields. Space to carry out many types of recreation programs is inadequate. Special gare areas are also needed for cycle sports, pickleball, and other sports.
LAND AVAILABILITY. Increased development activity throughout the planning area is impacting the avallability of future park sites. If we are to provide parks where they are needed, we should obtain park sites ahead of their need.
PARKLAND SERVICE LEVELS. At present, the City does not meet the Level-Of-Service goal adopted with the General Plan, which is 10 acres of improved parkland per 1,000 people. Our current service level is 6.51 acres per 1,000 peoplo, with significant areas of the city

EMBRACING OUR OPEN SPACE
Redding's location at the north end of California's central valley gives our city a natural quality that sets it apart from many others.
Snow-capped mountains and volcanic peaks, blue lakes and rushing water-this is the backdrop we experience every time we venture out of our homes. It is there as we ride to work, or play ball, or take the dog for a walk.
This regional setting extends down into Redding's urban landscape via the open space areas along the Sacramento River and its streams, and along the trails into our parks. These natural components of the park system create unique opportunities for hiking scenic paths, fishing in the clear running water, and observing wildlife like otters and eagles.
Sinca the Sacramento River is the focal point of our recreation and park system, open spaces, parks, and trails are all pianned to relate to this significant natural feature. Our park environments celebrate its beauty, the trail system links it to residential areas, and our open space efforts help protect habitats for the fish and other creatures that live along Its banks, The preservation of lands along the Sacramento River and Its
major tributary streams means that we and our children can experience the beauty of nature right here in our nelghborhoods.
A community open space program for Redding began with the first iteration of this plan. With City leadership and public support, we can ensure that the coming years of population expansion and increased development in our region will not cause further environmental degradation, but will instead restore and maintain those
qualities of our natural environment that the community now cherishes.
KEY OPEN SPACE GOALS AND POLICIES
LAND TYPES, The open space program will focus on six types of land consistent with General Plan goals and policles. These lands include steep slopes, floodplains, natural resource areas that support sensitive specles habitat, agricultural grazing lands, urban buffers, and sites next existing parks or which contain scenic, historical, culturat, or archaeological value.
LAND SELECTION. Open space activities will be primarily concentrated in 14 "open space interest areas." Identified through a geographic suitability analysis, these interest areas delineate lands with high open space values based on a set of criteria developed by the City. Further research will be directed in these areas to identify specific opportunities for preservation.
OPEN SPACE ACQUISITION. The intent of the open space program is to work with cooperative owners and willing sellers. The City will use a variety of methods to build a community open space network, including:
• Acceptance Of Land Donations
• Partnerships In Acquisition And Restoration
Conservation And Trail Easements
Leases
• Land Trades And Transfers

FUNDING RECOMMENDATIONS
The Or General Plan called for new approaches to fund our park system. In response to that directive, the Implementation Strategy of the Master
Plan sets out for consideration several funding options, some of which,
while new to Redding, are successfully employed in other jurisdictions. These proposals can help us address the large funding gap that now exists between our goals and the City's current funding mechanisms.
PARTNERSHIPS. Continue to seek partnerships with national, regional, and local organizations, as well as educational entities, the development community, and individuals, to create unique projects within the park, trail, and open space system.
GRANTS. Continue to pursue grant opportunities from federal, state, and local sources to plan and develop the proposed
improvements.
PARK IMPACT FEE. Establish the maximum fee amount allowed
by state law and implement the maximum fee, or lower, as
determined by the City Council.
LANDSCAPE MAINTENANCE DISTRICTS. Condition all new
residential developments that Include park improvements to form landscape maintenance districts to fund ongoing maintenance
costs.
PARK AND OPEN SPACE TAX. Consider an Increase in the tocal sales tax to fund acquisitlon, development, and maintenance of
parks, trails, and open spaces OR consider utilization of a beneflt assessment district to acquire, develop, and maintain parks, trails, and open space areas through the levying of a city-wide parcel tax.

Summary
The Open Space Strategy of the Parks, Trails and Open Space Master Plan defines the geographic focus, the types of land, and the activities in which the City of Redding will engage to promote the preservation and appropriate public use of important open space in the greater Redding area.
The protection of our valuable natural resources plays significant part in the City's 2000-2020 General Plan and the Open Space Strategy implements several policies and goals found in its Natural Resources, Recreation, and Community Development and Design Elements. The "Goals and Policies" section, found at the end of this Strategy, references each open space goal to those in the General Plan.
Our area is fortunate to have a variety of scenic natural features, the most important being the
Sacramento River, which is viewed as the focal point of the community and the organizing element of

Because the planning area for the Master Plan is so large (83 square miles), an important task for the open space program is to identify likely places to focus the City's acquisition and preservation efforts.
Proximity to the its river, its streams, and other bodles of water is one of the twelve criteria used in determining what types of land would make appropriate open space. The remaining criteria address
other General Plan Goals, including conserving the habitats of sensitive and endangered species, preserving agricultural lands, retaining and re-planting native oak woodlands, maintaining designated multifamily housing lands, preventing eroslon by limiting development on steep slopes, and protecting
property from flood damage by limiting development in floodplains.
Using a geographic informatlon system (GIS) to perform a spatial suitability analysis, the open space criteria developed in this Master Plan were mapped to identify areas with high open space values. These were then organized into 11 "Open Space Interest Areas." With this edition, staff was able to identify three additional Interest Areas, Riverland, Turtie Bay East and Henderson, which stood out from the former Sacramento River Corridor Interest Area as having individual goals and amenities. With these additions, all new maps and analyses will feature these 14 Open Space Interest Areas.
These interest Areas are not regulatory in nature as new zoning districts or overlays are not proposed.
•Their purpose is to provide a useful compilation of existing public information for the City and for those involved with land development and land preservation. The Interest Areas shown on the Open Space Suitability Analysis Map will help all parties achieve the natural resource and recreation goals already set out in the General Plan.
As with other components of the park and recreation system, the continued success of the open space program will depend on a combination of public/private partnerships, cooperative agreements, grant and other funding, and the willingness of diverse interests to come together to continue to improve a community resource that we will be proud of in years to come.

For many, the protection of the natural environment requlres little justification - you care for the things that you cherish. But in an age of
competing funding sources and difficult choices, decision-makers and voters need to be reminded of the many benefits open space brings to
a community.
In their "Habitat and Prosperity: Protecting Californla's Future," the California Environmental Dialogue, a group of corporate, environmental, and governmental leaders, drafted a benefit list that helps us frame some of the important reasons open space should play a part in a community's planning. These are discussed in the following sections.

CONTRIBUTE TO THE HEALTH OF COMMERCIAL FISHERIES
Nationally, the total economic contribution of the National Fisherles Program Is $3.6 billion annually, which supports 68,000 jobs (U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, 2011). Commercial fishing is an important industry in California. Currently, California's salmon industry alone is valued at $1.4 billion annually supplying tens of thousands of Jobs across California (Golden Gate Salmon Association 2015). Wetlands, riparian habitats, and the
watersheds of the Sacramento River play an important role as nurseries in the production of marine, freshwater, and shellfish. n
MITIGATE AIR AND WATER POLLUTION
Rainfall in urban areas washes pesticides and fertilizers from lawns, and oil, antifreeze, gasoline, salt and sand from parking lots and roads. This creates polluted runoff that flows into nearby water bodies. Although concentrated runoff is generally absent in forested watersheds, in heavily paved urban areas as much as 85 percent of all precipitation can enter nearby water systems in the form of polluted runoff. Because soils filter out many types of contaminants and vegetation slows the flow of water, open space buffers along rivers and streams significantly reduce polluted runoff into urban fresh water systems.
IMPROVE PROPERTY VALUES
Well-maintained parks and open spaces enhance the quality of life by providing scenic views and convenient recreation opportunities. As a result,
nearby landowners see an increase in real property values and marketability for their property.
Many organizations, including the Callfornia Local Government Institute, the Lincofn institute of Land Policy, and the Trust for Public Lands, speak to the relationship between public open space lands and property values. Generally, studies cited by these organizations indicate that homebuyers are willing to pay more for property located close to parks and open space. Although it is difficult to quantify the precise impact of open space on property values because of the many different types and uses of open space and the various land uses that surround them, the study The Impact of Parks and Open Space on Property Values and The Property Tax Base, determined that "a 20% increase in value for property adjoining or fronting a passive-use park is a reasonable starting point."
According to the 2010 report on The Economic Benefits of Open Space, Recreation Facilities and Walkable Community Design, a study conducted in three Maryland counties found that a 1 percent increase in preserved open space land (148 acres) would increase housing values to such an extent that it would generate over $250,000

Current Open Space System

EXISTING PROTECTION MEASURES
The policies of past and current Redding General Plans have provided measures to protect the environment from the negative effects of urban development. Particular attention has been given to preserving floodplains and steep land with slopes greater than 20 percent as open
space.
These areas have been set aside to prevent loss of life and property damage, minimize erosion, provide valuable habitats, and offer recreational opportunities. These lands are described/identified in the General Plan as "Greenway," and are subject to speclfic development constraints.
A review of current maps shows the amount of land designated as Greenway in the planning area to be approximately 8,000 acres. Much of this land is in private ownership and not accessible to the public.
To implement the "Greenway" policies of the General Plan, the City's zoning code also includes an Open Space District ("OS") designation that is used as an identification and preservation tool. Uses in lands in zoned "OS" are limited to those that are consistent with the undeveloped
nature of these of lands, excepting public infrastructure, tire protection access, pedestrian and bike trails, and dispersed recreational activities. Largely dedicated to the City as a result of the zoning and subdivision ordinances during the development project approval process, these open space areas are located throughout the urban landscape • along our many creeks, behind suburban homes bordering canyons and ravines, and areas adjacent to the Sacramento River.
PARKLAND AND OPEN SPACE
This Master Plan distinguishes parkland from open space for the purpose of evalvating inventory. Open Space is not counted as parkland and parkland is not counted as open space. Natural Area Parks, such as Mary Lake and Buckeye Natural Area Park are designated as parkland because they are located within residential areas and contain some (ueld J3)sew adeds uado pue 'sjeJl'squed pejepdn SupJeßas Buweaw auqnd--1*9) (eujjuo ajqe|!eAe) KBajens aoeds uedo qquewyoeny recreational amenitiles.

The City, using grant or other funding, may purchase open space lands important to the community, thereby acquiring full rights to the use of the

A conservation easement is a legal document made between a landowner and a public body or qualified conservation organization. The easement limits present and future property development rights. It can allow a property owner to live on the property and use it for its traditional use, (e.g. as a farm.) but protects it as well. The easement is legally recorded and bound to the deed of the property permanently, This allows some public control
Private land trust organizations, such as the Shasta Land Trust, or conservation entitles such as the Western Shasta Resource Conservation District, have been used as intermediaries for such arrangements. Such entities may even be the beneflclarles of the conservation easement. Each easement can be tallored to the specific characterlstics and uses of the land. The easement protects the property's natural or open space values, balancing the government's interest in preserving land with the private owner's desire to retain title.
Selling property to the City or a land conservation organization at a price below fair market value is called a "bargain sale." The difference between Bargain Sale
the sale price and the fair market value may be considered a charitable donation; hence a property owner may enjoy an income tax deduction or a reduction in estate taxes.

Some property owners may not seek a financial gain but want to preserve property. A donation by a landowner of all interest in property allows for Donations/Bequests

permanent protection without direct public expenditure. The tax benefits could be available to the donor since the property's fair market value may be considered a charitable donation. In a bequest, a tandowner retains ownership until death, at which time the ownership passes to the City or an identified conservation organization.

Dedications
As noted in the previous section, lands that are subject to flooding or whose slopes exceed 20 percent have
very limited development potential under the policies of the Redding General Plan. As part of the development process be these lands may be placed into either public or private open space easements (depending on the location and resource value) or dedicated to the City "in-fee". Since these areas generally cannot be developed, many property owners see value in giving these lands to the City who is then responsible for stewardship of the land for the benefit of the publlc.
EXISTING REGIONAL OPEN SPACE FRAMEWORK
The citles located at the upper end of California's central valley -- Redding, Shasta Lake and Anderson - together comprise a low-density, urbanized area situated within region containing many square miles of undeveloped federal and state-owned lands (see Regional Open Space Map).
The Shasta-Trinity National Forest, Whiskeytown National Recreation Area, and lands under the management of of the U.S. Bureau of Land Management provide to more than 110,000 people living In these citles. Immediately west of Redding, the State operates the Shasta State Historic Park, and within an hour's drive many additional state-managed wilderness areas, widlife refuges, and demonstration forest areas are
found.
Winding through this landscape is the beautiful Sacramento River, its cold waters flowing year-round out of
Shasta Dam. The River and its many tributaries support a diversity of plant and animal species, and contain
hlstorical spawning grounds for numerous species of fish, including four runs of Chinook salmon, as well as
steelhead trout. Remnants of the original riparian, or riverside, forest are found along their banks, and oak woodlands can still be found in the upland areas.
The Sacramento River and the publicly held lands around Redding and its neighboring cities create strong physical context of outdoor recreation opportunities, varied wildlife habltats, and remarkable scenic beauty that is valued by residents and visitors alike. Such an existing framework also suggests that a region-wide strategy for open space preservation may be most appropriate, one in which local jurisdictions work together
with adjoining governmental partners and grass roots organizations to protect the connecting waters and the flora and fauna throughout these lands.
This type of planning would reach beyond city limits and strive to have a positive effect for area resldents at a larger shared watershed level. Operating within a regional perspective, our cities and towns can integrate the surrounding natural landscape with urbanized areas by using streamside corridors and trails, and provlding for natural Islands. 4aysem egeds uado pue 'sjell'sued pajepdn buipuebau BupeaH 3liqnd-1'9) (eujuo ajqejjeA) ABajens apeds uodo nuawypeny

Implementing the General Plan's Open Space Goals
The Open Space Strategy implements the goals and policies found in the General Plan's Natural Resources
[NR], Community Development and Design [CDD], and Recreation [R] Elements. These directives outline specific types of land, described in the following pages, that the City must preserve and protect. Bracketed text, for example (NR6], refers to the relevant General Plan goals and policies, which can be found the
Appendix.

NATURAL RESOURCE AREAS THAT SUPPORT SENSITIVE SPECIES HABITAT
Aquatic Habitats Wherever there is water - creeks, rivers, sloughs, wetlands, seas, and oceans --- there are aquatic habitats. This general category embraces the water-related habitats described below, as well as streambeds. There
is a close interrelationship between aquatic communities and their adjacent riparian communities. Almost 1,500 acres of aquatic habitats are present In Redding's planning area. [General Plan Goal NR6]
Riparian Habitats Riparian corridors occur throughout the United States as linear strips of vegetatlon adjacent to streams, rivers, lakes, reservolrs, and other inland aquatic habitats. The types of vegetation assoclated with riparian areas contribute to unique ecosystems that perform a large variety of functions. Riparian habitats are characterized by rich and diverse bird life, and also support mammals, reptiles, and amphibians, which in
turn support larger animals.
Streams and rivers also function as corridors for wildlife dispersal and migration, and play an important role in connecting ecosystems that are often fragmented and made dysfunctional by urban development.
Statewide, only 5 percent of the historic river riparian acreage remains. Redding's planning area has significant stands of Sacramento River riparian zones that provide habitat for over 250 species of wildlife. As
many as 50 species require riparian areas for their survival. [NR6]
Vernal Pools
Vernal pools are seasonally flooded depressions with unique plants and animals. During the wet months of
spring, the rims of the pools change in color and plant composition as the water recedes. Several aquatic
invertebrates are restricted to these special habitats, including species of fairy and tadpole shrimp.
The California Department of Fish and Game estimates that a high percentage of the historically occurring vernal pools within the planning area have been lost or significantly degraded due to a combination of development, draining, grazing, and off-road vehicle use. {NR6]
Wetlands
is Saturation with water is the dominant factor determining the nature of soil development and the types of plant and animal communities found in wetlands. Wetlands store precipitation and surface water and then
slowly release the water into assoclated streams and lakes, ground water, and the atmosphere. Wetland
plants play an integral role in the ecology of watersheds, filtering pollution from storm waters, providing
breeding and nursery sites, resting areas for migratory specles, and refuge from predators. [NR6] (ueld Jesew eoeds uado pue 'speJl'syed pajepdn bujpueßaJ 6uueeH ouqnd--l'9) (aujjuc ejqe|!eAe) Strategy Attachment: Open Space

Open Space Interest Areas

OPEN SPACE MAPS
14 Interest Areas were identified through the GIS analysis within nine different watersheds distributed throughout the planning area. They are delineated on the Open Space Suitability Analysis Map. Green areas on the map show grid colls that have high open space values, with the darkest green having the highest
value.
The Interest Area map assists in organizing : framework for open space within our large planning area. It will be used by City staff and will show land developers, resource agencies, and the general public where the City wishes to focus its efforts. It is important to note that adjacent areas of lesser resource value may nevertheless provide a valuable contribution to the long-term function and viability of the River and stream corridor-based Open Space Interest Areas, but may not be included within the boundaries shown on the Interest Area map. As potential projects are brought forward for further study, the appropriate project boundaries will be determined.
Each Open Space Interest Area has the potential to address watershed health, outdoor recreation activities,
biological diversity, public safety, scenic views, agricultural or grazing preservation, public stewardship, and
education opportunities for area schools.
NOT ZONING DISTRICTS
It is important to understand that these Open Space Interest Areas do not constitute a zoning district or
category, but simply delineate areas that possess high community open space values and, therefore, deserve closer public attention for consideration of preservation, rastoration and/or protection.
The existence of an Interest Area does not modify the development rights (i.e. residential density) of a property as established by the General Plan and any applicable zoning district. Additional development application materials or the extenslon of development approval timelines, solely for the purposes of determining a site's actual suitability as open space, will not be required. ejqejjese) ABajens abeds uado nuawyen

Open Space Site Evaluations
The Interest Areas identify broad, generalized locations for potential community open space preservation and related activities and are not intended to identify specific propertles under consideration. Individual properties will need further analysis before they are Included for potential inclusion in the open space program. An open and objective system for evaluating any nomination or donation is important so that the public and decision- makers can welgh the merlts of each property against the program goals.
Consideration of the key factors listed below will provide a basis for creating this system. While they are consistent with the criteria used to define the Interest Areas, the factors further refine the evaluation process for each parcel and situation. As the open space program continues to develop, these factors and their weighting methodology can be adjusted to meet the evolving goals and concerns of the City and lts advisory committees.

Open Space Improvements and Amenities
An important part of the Open Space Strategy is the provision for appropriate public recreational use and access to lands within the open space

In some cases, the improvements for public use may consist of simple footpaths and trail markers, while elsewhere additional amenities may be warranted, especially in popular areas that recelve heavy use.
Most of the improvements listed In the next table are Included for visitor comfort or convenience, such as drinking fountains, restrooms and off- street parking areas. Other amenitles that Include concessions and slte rentals, suggest the possibillty of creating : a source of income to offset the
funds needed to provide and maintain community open space.
Any improvements must be done carefully so that the public's enjoyment of these special places Is balanced with the need to protect a site's natural resources from excessive development or use.
There will be instances where land planned as open space must also accommodate public service needs such as streets, utilities, and fire management and access trails. Care should be taken In the deslgn of these facilities to ensure, to the extent feasible, that the open space resources are not compromised, and that public use and enjoyment of the area is maintained.

Planning and Management
OPEN SPACE PROGRAMS AND MANAGEMENT PLANS
Protecting the areas valued resources and providing the public with access to recreational activities -- picnicking, fishing, hiking, boating and nature study ---- requires planning.
Activities to be undertaken and the management pians that will be developed will strive to balance public access and enjoyment with the need to protect and manage the land for its natural resource values. The varled and sometimes competing issues assoclated with each site can be evaluated and decided through this process, and may Involve neighborhood representatives, citizen organizations, resource management agencies, local governments, businesses, and interested individuals.

Public Support for Community Open Spaces
Throughout the United States, there is broad public support for parks and open space preservation.
The 2014 annual report form the Land Trust Alliance (LTA) showed great progress in having raised 30.6 million dollars and acquired 50 million acres of land conserved by land trusts. Their campaign for land has increased the pace of land conservation, improved the quality of land conservation, and ensured the permanence of land conservation.
California voters have approved of a number of bond measures for park and opon space development, generating billions of dollars for purchases by the State and by local governments.
STRONG LOCAL SUPPORT
Redding residents also appear to favor open space preservation as evidenced by the conclusions of community surveys taken in 2001 and 2015. In the fall of 2001, the City conducted a mail survey that polled 5,000 randomly selected households, with 1,352 responding to various parkland, recreation and to open space issues. As an update, new survey was issued in 2015 to 3,000 residents. Of those asked, 625 residents responded, yielding a 22% response rate. Key findings from the 2015 survey relating to open space, listed below, indicate is that there is support for an open space program in the Redding area.

Funding an Open Space Program
The preservation, development and maintenance of lands set aside for natural resource preservation and public use will require dependable, long- range funding. A program of this type necessarily takes the long view, calling for action today so that future generations may benefit.
In other cities, open areas preserved years ago at the edge of town are now cherished oases set within the urban landscape. As the Redding region continues to grow, adequate resources are needed to implement this open space strategy so that we may look back on our efforts to preserve our open spaces with pride.
While the Master Plan has a separate section that discusses funding and implementation strategies, open space activities often have additional
funding opportunities and sources.

SUBJECT: 6.1---Public Hearing Regarding Updated Parks, Trails, and Open Space Master
Plan.

Recommendation

Conduct a Public Hearing and upon conclusion, approve the updated Parks, Trails, and Open Space Master Plan (Plan); find the Plan to be consistent with the 2000-2020 General Plan; and
adopt the Mitigated Negative Declaration prepared for the Plan.

Fiscal Impact
There is no fiscal impact to approving the Plan document. Implementation of the Plan will likely include future costs for which staff will bring forward budget appropriations, developer agreements, fee schedules, and grants, for future consideration by the City Council (Council).

Alternative Action

The Council could direct staff to return with new proposal language at a future Council meeting, or provide staff with alternate direction

Background/Analysis

The updated Parks, Trails, and Open Space Master Plan draft was provided several weeks ago to
the City Council and has been available online for the last five weeks. First issued in 2004, the
Plan represents a comprehensive planning effort to guide future recreation development and natural area conservation in the Redding area. Encompassing a planning area of approximately
83 square miles, the Plan is an important planning tool for the community. Being prepared to manage future growth with respect to open space and recreational resources is vital to maintaining the current quality of life enjoyed by Redding residents.
This updated version of the Plan revises and reestablishes the vision for the City of Redding's (City) park, trail, and open space development. In addition to celebrating the City's

Re: 6.1--Public Hearing regarding Updated Parks,Trails, and Open Space Master Plan Page 2
accomplishments, the updated Plan provides a comprehensive examination of existing amenities, needs, and future growth patterns. With an updated analysis of the inventory and future plans, the updated Plan recommends the type and location of new facilities throughout the community. New recommendations include a full spectrum of sites, from neighborhood parks to community centers, and facilities for everything from mountain biking to pickleball.

The updated Plan details the continued development of a networked system of trails that connect parks, schools, neighborhoods and other destinations, Recommended development standards will create park areas that attract users of all age groups and abilities. Special attention is paid to creating neighborhood-serving parks, with a minimum size of five acres, affording space for active turf areas, playgrounds, shaded picnic areas, perimeter trails, basketball, and a sufficient buffer from adjacent homes. Also included in the updated Plan are revised goals and objectives that reflect achievements since the last iteration of this plan and project feasible achievements for Redding's future.
This meeting represents the fifth public meeting for the updated Plan. During the first and second quarter of 2017, it was reviewed by the Community Services Advisory Commission (CSAC) in rough draft form section by section, over several meetings. Commissioner comments from these meetings were incorporated, and Community Services Department staff created a new, more contemporary design for the document. At a Special Meeting of CSAC on October 11th, 2017,
commissioners unanimously voted in favor of recommending the City Council adopt the updated Plan. Following that meeting, staff incorporated additional comments from the commissioners and the public, and made general edits throughout the document, Staff presented the Plan to the to Planning Commission on November 21, 2017, for the second public hearing. At that time, the Commission voted to postpone their findings on General Plan consistency of the City of Redding Parks, Trails, and Open Space Master Plan Update in order in to return the document to CSAC to gather more community input. Staff received additional public input over the comment period and made several modifications to the Plan as a result.

CSAC was tasked with closely studying the Plan and providing input relative to policy recommendations. CSAC was presented an itemized list of proposed changes to the plan on June 13, 2018, and, at the third public hearing on July 23, 2018, unanimously voted for recommending the adoption of the Plan to the City Council. On July 24, 2018, the Planning Commission reviewed the Plan and found, unanimously, that the Plan is consistent with the General Plan and
recommended the City Council adopt the addendum to the mitigated negative declaration.

City of Redding Parks, Trails, and Open Space Master Plan Update (2018) apeds uado
E Subject

Update to the text of the City of Redding Parks, Traits, and Open Space Master Plan (PTOSMP)

Project Description
The proposed amendments to update the text of the PTOSMP include a number of technical
amendments and policy and strategy discussions, including the following:
Updates population projections and current parkland inventory
Deletes the "bikeway" strategy as bikeway planning is provided with the separate 2015 'syeJ'syied pajepdn
"Bikeway Action Plan".
Updates the open space strategy discussion, including additional preservation tools, open
space program activities, and open space goals. Refines various implementation strategies including funding options and mechanisms,
and operations and maintenance.
Updates maps and appendices

Environmental Setting

The proposed amendments affect properties Citywide.

Determination

On May 4, 2004, the City of Redding City Council adopted a Mitigated Negative Declaration for
the PTOSMP. The PTOSMP contains an inventory of parks, trails, and open space resources:
projections of future facility needs; policies related to obtaining additional park and open space lands; standards for development of such lands; and a funding/implementation strategy.

Based upon a review of the current amendments, it has been determined that an addendum is appropriate becausc the additions are minor and none of the following conditions (pursuant to Slate CEQA Guidelines Section 15162) have occurred:

1. Substantial changes are proposed for the project that will require major revision of the previous Mitigated Negative Declaration due to new, significant environmental effects or a
substantial increase in the severity of previously identified effects.
2. Substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which the project is undertaken that involve new, significant environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified effects.
3. New information of substantial importance indicates that:

a The project will have one or more significant effects not discussed in the previous Mitigated Nogative Declaration. ttachment: Addendum-Mitigated Negative Declaration (available buyzaH ouqnd--1'9) (aujuo upue6ai

Packet Pg. 222

000127

b. Significant effects previously examined will be substantially more severe than shown in
the previous Mitigated Negative Declaration.
c. Mitigation measures previously found not to be feasible would in fact be feasible and would substantially reduce one or more significant effects of the project, but the project proponcnts decline to adopt them.

d. Mitigation measures that are considerably different from those analyzed in the previous
Mitigated Negative Declaration would substantially reduce one or more significant effects, but the project proponents decline to adopt them.

FINDINGS

l. The City of Redding has determined that an addendum is warranted, finding that none of
the above conditions are in evidence and that there is no substantial evidence, in light of the whole record before the City, that the amendment proposal will have a significant effect on the environment.

2. The Addendum to the Mitigated Negative Declaration, with its supporting documentation (Initial Study), reflects the independent judgment and analysis of the City of Redding.

PUBLIC REVIEW DISTRIBUTION

Pursuant to State CEQA Guidelincs Section 15164(c), an addendum does not require circulation
for public review.

Copies of the Addendum, the Mitigated Negative Declaration, and the original Initial Study may be obtained at the Planning Division of the Development Services Department, City of Redding, 777 Cypress Avenue, Redding, CA 96001. Contact Paul Hellman at 530.225.4020.

MITIGATED NEGATIVE DECLARATION

Parks, Trails, and Open Space Master Plan State Clearinghouse No. 2002082026

SUBJECT

Parks, Trails, and Open Space Master Plan (Master Plan) for the City of Redding.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The Master Plan contains the following: (1) inventory of existing parks, trails, bikeways, and open space resources; (2) projections of future needs for additional facilities through the year 2020 based on growth projections of the General Plan; (3) policies necessary to obtain additional park and open
space lands and standards for the development of such lands (where appropriate); and (4) an implementation strategy that defines appropriate tools to be used in funding the program.
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

The Master Plan covers all territory within the City limits and Planning Area established by the
General Plan.
FINDINGS AND DETERMINATION
The City of Redding conducted an Initial Study (attached), which determined that the proposed project could have significant environmental effects but that those will be avoided or mitigated through adherence to the development policies noted in the document. Therefore, the preparation of an environmental impact report will not be required. There is no substantial evidence, in light of the whole record before the City, that the project may have a significant effect on the environment, If there are substantial changes that alter the character or impacts of the proposed project, another environmental impact determination will be necessary.
Prior to approval of the project, the lead agency may conclude, at a public hearing, that certain mitigation measures identified in the Mitigated Negative Declaration are infeasible or undesirable. In accordance with CEQA Section 15074.1, the lead agency may delete those mitigation measures and substitute other measures which it determines are equivalent or more effective. The lead agency would adopt written findings that the new measure is equivalent or more effective in mitigating or avoiding potential significant effects and that it, in itself, would not cause any potentially significant effect on the environment.

Based on the whole record (including the Initial Study and any supporting documentation) and the mitigation measures incorporated into the project, the City of Redding has determined that there is nö substantial evidence that the project will have S!edL'syIEd pajepdn Bujpuebas BuuBaH !qnd-19) (eujuo ajqejeAt) uopeuepag aspeboN pojebuw-wnpuappy nuawyoens

Further, it provides location parameters for parkland acquisition, establishes standards for park development, addresses maintenance of facilities, and provides a schematic trail system that will guide development over the next 20 years. The open-space component includes 12 open-space study areas that are intended to be the initial focus of the City's open-space efforts.

planning 9. Purpose/Use of the Initial Study: This initial study bas been prepared to evaluate whether the General Plan Environmental Impact Report (GPEIR) adequately discloses the envirommental effects associated with adoption of the Master Plan. As document, the analysis is not of lesser detail than that required for specific projects covered by the Master Plan, This initial study is being "tiered" off the GPEIR, which is incorporated by reference. Thus, this initial study does not replicate all background information, analyses, and other such information that would otherwise be redundant. The reviewer is directed to the General Plan Background Report and the GPEIR for specific information that was used as the basis for the conclusiona of this initial study. Both documents sre available at the City of Redding Planning Diviston Office, 777 Cypress Avenus, Rodding, CA 96001. A summary of impacts and mitigation measures identified in the GPEIR is found in Appendix "A." In preporing this initiul study, it has becn determined that existing conditions that could affect the analysis have not substantially changed since the GPEIR was certified. Dovelopment of each individual park and trail project requires site-specific enviroumontal analysis under CEQA.

9. Surrounding Land Uses and Settings: Varioua citywide uses and settings. The GPEIR and its related General Pian Background Report contain descriptions of cxisting land uses within the City as well as discussion/comparison of Shasta County's land use plan within Redding's Sphere of Influence.

ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS POTENTIALLY AFFECTED:

areas designated under the Master Plan will generally coincide with the "Greenway" classification of the General Plan. Where that is not the case, acquiring lands for open space does not contradict policies of the General Plan.

Responsible or trustee agençies have not identified any conflicts with applicable plans or policies, including any habitat conservation plan or natural community conservation plon.
c. The Gencral Plan contains several policies intended to minimize the impacts of recreational facilitics on adjacent residential ' development (R9A through R9G). These policies will sufficiently prolect existing development from impacts associated with park
construction.

d. The diagram included in the Master Plan indicates that at loast 1 futute park site may be established in an ares classified as prime agricultural soils. The GPEIR acknowledges that buildout of the General Plan (including park development) will have a significant
and unavoidable impact through the conversion of agricultural land to urban uses. The City Council adopted requited findings and

a, b, c, d. Cumulative development in the City, including park development, would impact air quality as disclosed in the GPBIR. Discussion

No change in growth areas or density would occur with implementation of the Master Plan to change these cumulative impacts. Further, development of a comprehensively designed trail system should reduce, to some degree, vehicle miles traveled, leading to air quality benefits. The Air Quality Element of the General Plan includes strategies to reduce omissions related to land use and traffic citulation as outlined ou pages 8-24 through 8-26 of the Final RIR. Even though the air quality improvement strategies included in the element ate comprehensive, the offectiveness of the strategies is limited as long as vehicles powered by internal combustion engines aro the primary means of transportation. The GPEIR found that implementation of the Air Quality Element strategics would not reduce the effects of projected growth sufficiently to reduce impacts to levels that are less than significant. Ao a result, the Redding City Council, at the time of certification of the GPEIR, adopted required findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations with regard to air quality impacts (City Council Resolution No. 2000-166).

b, c. Mineral resources have been identified by the State Division of Mines and Geology. Areas identified by that agency as being "critical mineral resources" are identified on the General Plan by the Critical Mineral Resource Overlay. Much of this resource is found within the Sacramento River channel, suggesting that focusing trail and park efforts along the river could result in sbort- to mid-term land use incompatibititics. However, due to the incompatible nature of extraction activitics on existing development, such operations are unlikely to be approved. Upon complotion of mining operations in other locations, open-space preserves may be cstablished.

SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA, COUNTY OF SHASTA
ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR) INFORMATION PACKAGE

Most civil disputes are resolved without filing a lawsuit, and most civil lawsuits are resolved without a trial. Private providers offer a varicty of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) processes to help people resolve disputes without a trial.

Below is some information about the potential advantages and disadvantages of ADR, the most common types of ADR, and a how to find a local ADR program or neutral. You can read more information about these ADR processes and watch videos thai demonstrate them at http://www.courts.ca.gov/programs- adr.htm If the parties agrec to an ADR program, the parties may file the agreement with the court for the purpose of assisting the court in determining how to proceed at the case management conference.

Potential Advantages and Disadvantages

ADR may have a variety of a advantages and disadvantages over a trial, depending on the type of ADR process used and the particular case:

Potential Advantages
Saves time
Saves money
Gives partics more control over the dispute resolution process and outcome
Preserves or improves relationships.

Potential Disadvantages
May take more time and money if ADR does not resolve the dispute
Procedures to learn about the other side's case (discovery), jury trial, appeal, and other court protections may be limited or unavailable.

Most Common Types of ADR

Mediation - A neutral person called a "mediator" helps the parties communicate in an effective and constructive manner so they can try to settle their dispute. The mediator does not decide the outcome, but helps the parties to do so. Mediation is usually confidential, and may be particularly useful when parties want or need to have an ongoing relationship, such as in disputes between family members, neighbors, co- workers, or business partners.
Settlement Conferences - A judge helps the parties to understand the strengths and weaknesses of their case and to discuss settlement. The judge does not make a decision in the case but helps the parties to
negotiate a settlement. Settlement conferences may be particularly helpful when the parties have very different ideas about the likely outcome of a trial and would like an experienced neutral to help guide them toward a resolution.

Neutral Evaluation - The parties briefly and informally present their facts and arguments to a neutral person called an "evaluator". who is often an expert in the subject matter of the dispute. The evaluator does not decide the outcome of the dispute. but helps the parties to do so by giving them a non-binding opinion about the strengths. weaknesses. and likely outcome of their case. Depending on the neutral cvaluation program and the parties* wishes. the evaluator may then help the parties try to negotiate e settlement. Neutral evaluation may be appropriate if the parties want a neutral person's opinion about how

Informahon Sheet
Shasta Comp Supenor Coon ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION l'age lori
LF-CIV-103 frev March 28. 2013 (ADR) INFORMATION PACKAGE

the case might be resolved, if the primary dispute is the amount of damages, or if there arc technical issues that the parties would like a neutral expert to help resolve.

Arbitration The parties present evidence and arguments to a neutral person called an "arbitrator" who then decides the outcome of the dispute. Arbitration is less formal than a trial, and the rules of evidence are usually relaxed. If the parties agree to binding arbitration, they waive their right to a trial and agree to accept the arbitrator's decision as final. With nonbinding arbitration, any party may reject the arbitrator's decision and request a trial. Arbitration may be appropriate when the parties want another person to decide the outcome of their dispute but would like to avoid the formality, time and expense of a trial, or want an expert in the subject matter of the dispute to make the decision.

Selecting an ADR Program and Neutral

Selecting an ADR program and neutral are important decisions. Be sure to learn about the rulcs of any
program and the qualifications of any neutral you are considering, and about their fces.

Shasta County Supcrior Court ADR Programs

Private ADR Providers To find a private ADR program or neutral evaluator, search the Internet, your local telephone or business directory, or legal newspaper for dispute resolution, mediation, settlement, or
arbitration services.

Legal Representation and Advice

ADR neutrals are not allowed to represent or to give legal advice to the participants in the ADR process.
