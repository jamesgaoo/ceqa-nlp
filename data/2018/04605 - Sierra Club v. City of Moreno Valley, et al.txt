VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- INTRODUCTION

2 1. This action challenges the approval by Respondent, City of Moreno Valley

4 ("City"), on or about April 17, 2018, of the Moreno Valley Logistics Center

5 project, including certification of a Final Environmental Impact Report, Specific

6 Plan Amendment, and all related land use approvals (collectively, "the MVLC
Project" or "the Project").

7

8 2. The Moreno Valley Logistics Center Project concerns the construction of four

9 buildings totaling 1,736,180 square feet of industrial space on 89.4 acres of

10 vacant land in the City of Moreno Valley. The Project will operate as a high

11 cube warehouse logistics center, meaning that diesel trucks primarily traveling

12 from the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles will bring cargo to the

13 warehouse buildings for storage and sorting for transport on other trucks to

14 destinations in and outside California. These operations will occur 24 hours per

15 day, seven days per week. The Project site is adjacent to existing single-family
residences, yet

16 the adverse and significant impacts associated with the Project

17 have not been adequately evaluated and/or mitigated in violation of the

18 California Environmental Quality ("CEQA") (Public Resources Code § 21000 et
seq.).

19

20 3. The City of Moreno Valley's certification of the Final Environmental Impact

21 Report ("EIR") for the Project must be vacated because the record lacks

22 substantial evidence in support of the EIR's conclusions, and because the EIR

23 fails to adequately describe or disclose relevant information. Also, the Project

24 results in significant and unavoidable impacts but mitigation is ineffective to

25 reduce impacts. Additionally, the City improperly rejected feasible mitigation

26 measures and project alternatives that would lessen some of the Project's
harmful environmental effects.

27 //

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- 4. During the administrative review process, the City was notified that there was
2 need for further analysis and mitigation due to the Project's adverse

3 environmental effects. In spite of these reasoned comments in the record, the

4 City approved the Project and certified the Final EIR.
5 5. By this verified petition, Petitioner Sierra Club alleges the following:
1O PARTIES

7 6. Petitioner, SIERRA CLUB, is a national environmental organization of 829,913

8 members, of which 182,402 members reside in California. The San Gorgonio
9 Chapter of the Sierra Club has membership of 7,439 individuals with 3,965

10 members living in Riverside County. Sierra Club's goals include protecting
11 California's lands, waters, air and wildlife. Local members of the San Gorgonio
12 Chapter of the Sierra Club reside in the general vicinity of the Project site and

13 are concerned with the Project's impacts to the local and regional environment.

14 Sierra Club submitted comments opposing approval of the Project to the City.

15 7. Respondent, CITY OF MORENO VALLEY, is a political subdivision of the

16 State of California. The City is a local governmental agency charged with the

17 authority of regulating and administering local land use and development within

18 its territory in compliance with the provisions of its general plan and zoning

19 ordinances as well as applicable provisions of State law, including CEQA. The

20 City is the lead agency for the Project and is therefore charged with the duty of
21 ensuring compliance with applicable State and local laws.

22 8. Real Party in Interest, PROLOGIS LP, was the applicant for the Project, has an

23 ownership interest in the property, and/or claims an interest in the Project
24 approvals at the subject of this lawsuit.

25 9. DOES 1 through 100 are individuals or entities that may have an ownership
26 interest in the property, were project applicants, or claim an interest in the

27 approvals at the subject of this lawsuit. Petitioner is unaware of the true names

4 STATEMENT OF FACTS

5 The Project

6

7 10. The MVLC Project is described as a proposal for the construction and operation

8 of four industrial warehouse logistics and/or light industrial buildings, totaling

9 1,736,180 square feet, on 89.4 vacant acres in the City of Moreno Valley.

10 11. The buildings will range in size from 97,222 square feet to 1,351,763 square

11 feet. The largest building-Building 1 - is approximately 1,350,000 square feet

12 with 200 truck dock doors/bays. Building 2 is 122,275 square feet with 13 truck

13 dock doors. Building 3 is a maximum of 97,922 square feet with 17 dock doors.

14 Building 4 is a maximum of 164,920 square feet with 25 truck dock doors. In

15 total, the Project will entail a total of 255 truck docks or bays for the shipping
and receiving of goods.

16

17 12. The Project includes an "alternate site plan" that would omit Building 2 and

18 construct a 166-space truck trailer parking lot in its place on Parcel 2. If this site

19 plan is implemented, the truck trailer parking lot would be utilized as overflow
parking for Building 1.

20

21 13. The Project site is bounded by Heacock Street on the west, Indian Street on the

22 east, Krameria Avenue on the north, and the southerly terminus of the Project
aligns with Cardinal Avenue.

23

24 14. The areas to the immediate east along Indian Street are populated with single-

25 family homes in residential zones constructed from 1987-2006. The Project's

26 Building 1 will be located along Indian Street adjacent to these residential land

uses.

27

28 15. Access to Building will be provided by three driveways along Krameria

4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 Avenue, one driveway at Indian Street, and one driveway at Cosmos Street.

3 Trucks servicing Building 1 may therefore travel on Indian Street, adjacent to

4 residences. The record indicates record that truck traffic may be prohibited on

5 Indian Street by the Project's conditions of approval; nevertheless, without

6 enforceable measures to prevent trucks from using Indian Street, trucks are still

7 reasonably expected to use Indian Street. Moreover, the Project introduces new

8 truck traffic on Krameria Avenue east of Cosmos Street and within the dock area
parallel to Indian Street.

9

10 16. The Project site is within the Moreno Valley Industrial Area Plan ("MVIAP").

11 The MVIAP was adopted in 1989 and it covers 1,540 acres within the

12 southwestern portion of Moreno Valley. The MVIAP sets forth development

13 regulations for the subject planning areas. Among other requirements, the

14 MVIAP defines restricted land uses for within 300 feet of existing or planned
residential areas. (Section III, C.1, Section III D.)

15

16 17. The Project proposes an amendment to the MVIAP (*Specific Plan

17 Amendment") to allow the applicant to reduce the 300-foot buffer to 100-feet

18 with respect to the Project's buffer from residential uses to the east along Indian
Street.

19

20 18. The Project includes the certification of Final Environmental Impact Report

21 PEN16-002 (P15-036) and the following land use approvals:

22 a) Specific Plan Amendment PEN16-001 (P15-036) approving a Specific

23 Plan Amendment to the MVIAP to modify the buffering and

24 landscaping requirements for the Indian Street Project Frontage;

25 b) Plot Plans PEN16-0003 through PEN16-0006 (PA15-0014 through
PA15-0017); and,

26

27 c) Tentative Parcel Map No. 36150 PEN16-0007 (PA14-0018).

- CEOA Review and Project Approval

2

3 19. The City circulated a Notice of Preparation (NOP) for the Project pursuant to
CEQA on June 17, 2015.
A
4o 20. The Project's Draft EIR pursuant to CEQA was circulated for public comment
on July 22, 2016.

7 21. The Project's Final EIR was prepared on or about February 9, 2017.

8 22. The Final EIR finds that the Project will result in significant and unavoidable

9 impacts in terms of air quality (construction, operation and cumulative air

10 emissions), greenhouse gas emissions, land use/planning (conflict with regional
transportation plans) and traffic/transportation.

11

12 23. On July 20, 2017, the City of Moreno Valley's Planning Commission voted to

approve

13 the Project at a public hearing (Resolutions Nos. 2017-18, 2017-19 and
2017-20).

14

15 24. On September 5, 2017, the City of Moreno Valley City Council held a public

16 hearing on the Project. The City Council continued the item to October 2, 2017

17 with a note to continue Council deliberations but to accept no further public
testimony.

18

19 25. On September 19, 2017, the MVLC Project appeared on the City's General

20 Business calendar (Item G.1). The Council considered and approved a

21 continuance of the "deliberation period" to the November 7, 2017 Council
meeting.

22

23 26. On October 2, 2017, the MVLC Project appeared on the Council agenda as a

24 General Business calendar (Item G.1). The Council further continued the
Project to November 7, 2017.

25

26 27. On November 7, 2017, the MVLC Project again appeared as a General Business

27 calendar (Item G.1) on the Council agenda. The Council approved a continuance

28 of the item to the January 16, 2018 Council meeting at the request of the

-6-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

applicant.
2 28.On January 16, 2018, the MVLC Project again appeared on the Council's

A General Business calendar (Item G.1). The Council continued the item to April
17, 2018 at the request of the applicant.
5

6 29.On April 17, 2018, the City Council considered the MVLC Project on the

7 Council's General Business calendar (Item G.1). At this meeting, the City

8 Council voted to approve the Project including but not limited to certification of
the Final EIR.

9

10 30. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the City posted the

11 Notice of Determination (NOD) pursuant to CEQA on April 18, 2018.

12 31. The City's approval of the Project will cause Petitioner irreparable injury

13 for which Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law. Petitioner and its members

14 will be irreparably harmed by the City's actions in approving the Project.

15 Petitioner was harmed by, among other things, the failure of the City in its

16 certification of the EIR to adequately evaluate the potential impacts of the

17 Project, and the City's approval of the Project without providing adequate and

18 effective mitigation measures contrary to the requirements of State law.

19 32. The maintenance of this action is for the purpose of enforcing important public

20 policies of the State of California with respect to the protection of the

21 environment under CEQA and conformance with state law and local law. The

22 maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a substantial benefit upon

23 the public by protecting the public from environmental and other harms alleged

24 in this Petition. Petitioner is acting a as a private attorney general to enforce these
public policies and prevent such harm.

25

26 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

27 33. This Court has jurisdiction to issue writs of mandate under Code of Civil
Procedure Section 1094.5.

28

-7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- 34. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure

2 Sections 393 and 394 as the Project is located in, and the relevant events
m v occurred in Riverside County.
35. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing the action by
4n complying with the requirements of Public Resources Code § 21167.5, in

6 notifying Respondent of the filing of this action (attached hereto as Exhibit "A"),

7 and by complying with the requirements of Public Resources Code § 21167.6, in

8 notifying Respondent of Petitioner's election to prepare the record of
9 Respondent proceedings in connection with this action (attached hereto as
10 Exhibit "B").

11

12 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES
cO 36. During the Project's administrative review process, Petitioner commented to the
14 City that the Project would result in potentially significant impacts to/from
15 including, but not limited to: air quality, energy, greenhouse gases, land use,
16 noise, traffic and others. Petitioner commented that the EIR was legally
17 inadequate; that further mitigation was required; and that project alternatives

18 were feasible.

19 37. As a result of these comments in the record, Petitioner exhausted its

20 administrative remedies within the meaning of Cal. Public Resources Code §
21 21177.

CAUSE OF ACTION 22

(Writ of Mandate) 23

24 (All parties did not comply with the requirements of CEQA.)

25 38. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 37 above as
26 though set forth in full herein.
27

28

-8-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 39. The California Environmental Quality Act (*CEQA") (Public Resources Code cop

W 21100 et seq.), enacted in 1971, requires government agencies to consider the

4 environmental consequences of their actions before approving projects subject to
CEQA's provisions.
n

6 40. The Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") is considered "the heart" of CEQA.

7 To effectuate the Legislature's goals of environmental protection, CEQA

8 provides that an adequate EIR must evaluate all potentially significant

9 environmental impacts of a proposed project including both direct and indirect

10 impacts as well as cumulative impacts. (State CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15126,
15126.2 (a), 15130)
11

12 41. An EIR must include description of the proposed Project. (State CEQA

13 Guidelines § 15124). An inaccurate or incomplete project description

14 undermines CEQA's purposes, particularly where it minimizes the project's

15 environmental impacts. "An accurate, stable, and finite project description is the

16 sine qua non of an informative and legally sufficient EIR." County of Inyo V.

17 City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 192-93.

18 42. CEQA establishes a substantive mandate on the part of the lead agency to

19 mitigate the significant environmental impacts of a project. (Public Resources

20 Code § 21002, 21002.1; State CEQA Guidelines, § 15021 (a).) A lead agency

21 may not approve a project for which there are significant environmental impacts

22 unless the agency makes findings that: (a) mitigation measures have been

23 required of the project which avoid or substantially lessen the significant

24 environmental impacts, or (b) mitigation measures are found to be infeasible

25 based on substantial evidence. (Public Resources Code §§ 21081, 21081.5; State

26 CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15091 (a)(b), 15092 (b).)

27 43. CEQA additionally provides that adopted mitigation measures must be certain

28 and enforceable. (Public Resources Code § 21081.6(b); State CEQA Guidelines,

-9-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- § 15126.6(a)(2).) The lead agency must ensure that mitigation measures are
N U required by or incorporated into the project to ensure that the measures are
actually carried out. (Public Resources Code § 21081.6 (a), (b).)
L 44. CEQA furthermore provides that a lead agency must evaluate alternatives to the
wn proposed project, or the location of the project, which would attain most of the

6 basic objectives of the project but would avoid or substantially lessen any of the

7 project's significant environmental effects. (State CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.6

8 (a).) The lead agency has duty to adopt a project alternative if it is feasible.
9 (Public Resources Code § 21002) A lead agency may not reject an alternative
10 unless the agency makes findings supported by substantial evidence showing
11 that the alternative is infeasible. (Public Resources Code, §§ 21081, 21081.5;
12 State CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15091 (a)(3), 15092.)
13 45. Petitioner and others commented that the EIR failed to accurately describe the
14 Project.

15 a) By way of example, the Project Description includes an option for

16 Building 2 to develop as a 166-space trailer parking area. The assumption
17 is that this alternate use would be less intense and therefore result in more

18 limited impacts. This conclusion is not supported by fact, where truck
19 activity may intensify near surrounding receptors. The EIR indicates only
20 81 trips per day for Building 2 and the trip distribution assumptions
21 indicated that trips for Building 2 would not involve activity east of
22 Cosmos Street on Krameria Avenue. However, the EIR is silent as to the
23 typical daily activity for this optional use or the anticipated travel routes.
24 b) By way of further example, there is content buried in the traffic study
25 showing that the Project would include an amendment to the City's
26 designated truck routes for Indian Avenue, south of the driveway at the

27 southeast corner of Building 1, if the bridge over the flood control
28

-10-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

channel is constructed. The City claims this is not part of the proposed
2 Project. However, the EIR must evaluate this scenario as part of the air
3 quality, traffic and noise impacts to the extent this is a reasonably

4 foreseeable change to the circumstances of the Project.

5 46. Petitioner and others commented that the EIR failed to adequately evaluate

6 impacts to/from including, but not limited to, air quality, energy, greenhouse gas

7 emissions, land use, noise, and traffic.

8 a) By way of example, Petitioner and others commented that the EIR's

9 analysis of the Project's energy impacts is inadequate in terms of the

10 requirements of State CEQA Guidelines, Appendix F. The City failed to
11 require sufficient analysis of the Project's energy consumption,
12 transportation energy impacts, and to demonstrate that the Project is
13 taking steps to reduce dependency on fossil fuels. For instance, the City
14 failed to evaluate or demonstrate how the Project "increases reliance on
15 renewable energy sources." The Project is not required to use any solar

16 energy despite solar energy being a feasible measure to reduce the
17 Project's energy consumption.

18 b) By way of further example, Petitioner and others commented that the

19 Project has significant land use impacts in terms of the Project's

20 nonconformance and inconsistency with the MVIAP, which includes the
21 goal of minimizing or avoiding potential conflicts with surrounding land

22 uses. The Project does not minimize or avoid conflicts with adjacent
23 residential land uses in that the Project reduces the required 300-foot
24 setback between truck-intensive uses and existing homes to the east of the

25 Project site. Furthermore, the EIR fails to demonstrate compliance with

26 the MVIAP and Moreno Valley Municipal Code in terms of acceptable

27 noise levels, air quality, and truck routes. There is also strong evidence
28

-11-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

that the Specific Plan Amendment has impacts in terms of reducing
N 00 minimum development standards set forth in the City's Municipal Code,
because the Municipal Code requires at least a 250 foot setback between
industrial and residential land uses.

5 c) By way of further example, the EIR concludes that air quality and health

6 risk impacts are less than significant, but the estimated impacts are very

7 close to the relevant threshold and material errors in the impact analyses

8 suggest the impacts may actually exceed applicable thresholds.

9 47. Petitioner and others commented that not all feasible mitigation was required of

10 this Project, and Petitioner and others proposed feasible mitigation that has not

11 been shown to be infeasible based on substantial evidence in the record.

12 a) For instance, Petitioner proposed mitigation with respect to the Project's

13 significant air quality (NO%) impacts, such as requiring that the Project
14 use only electric forklifts (indoor and outdoor) or incorporate the phase-in
15 of electric, hybrid electric, hydrogen electric, or battery operated (i.e., non

16 diesel) trucks. The City declined to adopt feasible mitigation to address
17 significant impacts, and the City failed to make findings supported by
18 substantial evidence that the proposed measures are infeasible.

per year, 19 b) Again for instance, the Project will generate 42,404.68 MTCO2e

20 far in excess of the SCAQMD screening threshold of 10,000 MTCO2e
21 per year, thus the EIR concludes that the Project results in significant

22 greenhouse gas emission ("GHG") impacts. The Project is a substantial

23 source of new GHG emissions, but it fails to adopt all feasible mitigation
24 to reduce GHG emissions, such as requiring the use of solar energy which
25 is a major contributor of GHG emissions. The City has indicated through
26 planning documents a desire to increase reliance on renewable energy
27 sources, yet the Project does not incorporate the use of solar energy. The
28

-12-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

City failed to make findings supported by substantial evidence that solar

2 energy is infeasible.

3 48. Petitioner and others commented that proposed mitigation measures were

4 uncertain, unenforceable, ineffective and/or deferred in violation of CEQA. By

5 way of example, Petitioner and others commented that MM 4.3-14 is not

6 enforceable because it states that various air quality measures shall be

7 "encouraged", e.g., that the Project shall encourage "all fleet vehicles to conform

8 to 2010 air quality standards or better". Petitioner urged the City to impose a

9 requirement on the Project requiring that only 2010 model year engine trucks be

10 permitted to access the Project site, and Petitioner demonstrated that such a

11 measure is feasible within the meaning of CEQA including that this measure has

12 been imposed on other similar projects in the Inland Empire.
13 49. Petitioner and others commented that there are feasible alternatives available that

14 would minimize the Project's impacts particularly to the residential areas to the

15 east. These alternatives include: the "No Project Alternative" (i.e., the no

16 amendment to the MVIAP setback requirement) and the Reduced Project

17 Alternative. These alternatives have not been shown to be infeasible based on

18 substantial evidence in the record. The applicant's desire for a certain

19 development is not a valid reason to reject feasible alternatives under CEQA.
20 Where an alternative is feasible, it must be adopted by the lead agency absent

21 findings of infeasibility supported by substantial evidence.
22 108938 50. For these reasons, the City's actions in certifying the EIR constitute an abuse of
discretion within the meaning of CEQA and the Project approvals must be set
aside. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1085, 1094.5; Public Resources Code § 21168.)
