23
24 Petitioner Courtside Manor Homeowners Association ("Petitioner" or "Courtside")
25 petitions this Court for a Writ of Mandate, directed to Respondents El Dorado County and the
26 El Dorado County Board of Supervisors (*Respondents"). Petitioner challenges Respondents?
27 August 14, 2018, adoption of the Mitigated Negative Declaration and approval of the Diamond
28 Springs Village Apartments Planned Unit Development PD17-0002 ("Project"). The Project

F allows for the construction of ten multifamily residential buildings consisting of a total of 80
2 residential units and a community building. Petitioner contends that Respondents' approvals
0 7 1 0N for the Project violate the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code
section 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"), Petitioner alleges as follows:
PARTIES

1. Petitioner Courtside Manor Homeowners Association ("Courtside") is a California
non-profit public benefit corporation formed under the laws of the State of California in 1999.
8 The Courtside Manor neighborhood is adjacent to the Project. Courtside is committed to the
9 protection of environmental values and well-being of its citizens, and also is committed to the
10 protection of County-wide environment and resources. The group is composed of homeowners
11 whose personal, aesthetic, and property interests will be severely injured if the adoption of the
12 Project is not set aside pending full compliance with CEQA and all other environmental laws.
13 Courtside members utilize and enjoy the County's and State's natural resources. Courtside
14 brings this petition on behalf of all others similarly situated who are too numerous to be named

15 and brought before this court as petitioners. As a group composed of residents and property
16 owners, Courtside is within the class of persons beneficially interested in, and aggrieved by, the
17 acts of Respondents as alleged below. Courtside and its members participated in the
18 administrative processes herein, and exhausted its remedies. Accordingly, Courtside has

19 standing to sue.

20 2. Respondent El Dorado County is a political subdivision of the State of California

21 and a body corporate and politic exercising local government power. El Dorado County is the
22 CEQA "lead agency" for the Project. As lead agency for the Project, El Dorado County is
23 responsible for preparation of an environmental document that describes the Project and its

24 impacts, and, if necessary evaluates mitigation measures and/or alternatives to lessen or avoid
25 any significant environmental impacts. The County also has principal responsibility for
26 determining whether projects within its jurisdiction are consistent with applicable land use
27 ordinances and other applicable laws.

2 28
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

L 3. Respondent El Dorado County Board of Supervisors is a legislative body duly

2 authorized under the California Constitution and the laws of the State of California to act on
m + 10 N co behalf of the County of El Dorado. Respondent Bl Dorado County Board of Supervisors is
responsible for regulating and controlling land use within the County including, but not limited
to, implementing and complying with the provisions of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, 14
California Code of Regulations, title 14, section 15000 et seq. (the "Guidelines"), applicable land
use ordinances and other laws. As the elected representatives of the people of the County, the
Board of Supervisors establishes overall County priorities and sets policy. The Board of

9 Supervisors is the governing body of the County and is ultimately responsible for reviewing and

10 approving or denying the Project.

11 4. Real Party in Interest Sergei Oleshko is the owner of the property where the

12 Project will be constructed, and the Project applicant.

13 5. Real Party in Interest CoreCare Foundation is identified on Project documents as

14 an applicant. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that CoreCare

15 Foundation is California trust.

16 6. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and identities of DOES 1 through 20 and

17 21 through 40, inclusive, and sues such unnamed Respondents and Real Parties in Interest

18 respectively, by their fictitious names. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon

19 alleges, that fictitiously named Respondents and Real Parties in Interest also are responsible for

20 all acts and omissions described above. When the true identities and capacities of Respondents

21 and Real Parties in Interest have been determined, Petitioner will, with leave of Court if

22 necessary, amend this Petition to include such identities and capacities.

23 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

24 7. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to

25 Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, and Public Resources Code section 21168.5. In the

26 alternative, this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 10945 and

27 Public Resources Code section 21168.

28
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 3

P 8. Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the State of California

2 in and for the County of El Dorado pursuant to sections 393, 394 and 395 of the Code of Civil

c Procedure.

BACKGROUND FACTS

9, The Project is located on a 10.7-acre parcel (APN# 051-461-59) on the south side

6 of Black Rice Road, approximately 1,000 feet west of the intersection with Highway 49, in the

7 Diamond Springs Area of El Dorado County.

8 10. The Project consists of ten multifamily residential buildings designed for 80

9 residential units, as well as a community building and one unit for an onsite manager.

10 11. A version of the Project initially went to the County Planning Commission on June
11 22, 2017. The Planning Commission approved the project as it was proposed at that time, but

12 the Board of Supervisors reversed the approval on appeal and referred it back to planning staff

13 due to various concerns, including access to the Project site.

14 12. On June 28, 2018, the Project came back to the Planning Commission and was

15 approved. Petitioner appealed the approval to the Board of Supervisors.

16 13. Petitioner and others submitted comments objecting to the Project, and raising

17 concerns about traffic, biological resources, public services, and safety impacts resulting from

18 traffic and increased risks in the event of a fire.

19 14. On August 14, 2018, over Petitioner's objections, the El Dorado County Board of

20 Supervisors adopted the Mitigated Negative Declaration and approved the Project.
21 15. .On August 31, 2018, Respondents filed a Notice of Determination with the County

22 Clerk of El Dorado County as provided for in Public Resources Code, section 21152.

23 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

24 AND INADEQUACY OF REMEDY

25 16. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant

26 action and has exhausted any and all available administrati ve remedies to the extent required

27 by law.

28
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

T 17. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code, section

2 21167.5 by mailing written notice of this action to the Respondents. A copy of this written
0v notice and proof of service are attached as Exhibit A to this Petition for Writ of Mandate.

18. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.6 by
N vo concurrently filing a request concerning preparation of the record of administrative proceedings
relating to this action.
course of ordinary law 19. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the
co unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside their

9 approval of the Project and adoption of the Mitigated Negative Declaration. In the absence of

10 such remedies, Respondents' approval will remain in effect in violation of State law.

11 20. This action has been brought within 30 days of the filing of the Notice of

12 Determination as required by Public Resources Code section 21167(c).
STANDING 13

14 21. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because

15 Petitioner's aesthetic, environmental and property interests are directly and adversely affected

16 by Respondents' adoption of the Mitigated Negative Declaration and approval of the Project.

17 ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS ACTIONS

18 22. Petitioner brings this action on the basis, among others, of Government Code

19 section 800, and other applicable laws, which award Petitioner's attorneys' fees in actions to

20 overturn agency decisions that are arbitrary and capricious, such as the decisions here in

21 question.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 22

Abuse of Discretion 23

24 Violation of CEQA, Public Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.

25 23. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein, as if set forth in full, each and every

26 allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 22.

27 24. Respondents have abused their discretion and failed to act in the manner required

28 under CEQA with respect to the Project because they have failed to adequately analyze the
5 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Project's environmental impacts and failed to identify necessary and feasible mitigation
measures. Moreover, substantial evidence in the administrative record supports a "fair 071 00 c argument" that the Respondents' approval of the Project may result in a significant impact to
the environment.

I. A Full Environmental Impact Report is Required for the Project
25. Substantial evidence in the administrative record supports a "fair argument" that
the Respondents' approval of the Project may result in a significant impact to the environment,
and a full EIR is required. In each of the following areas of impact analysis, the IS/MND and
9 fails to comply with CEQA:

10 A. Impacts to Traffic:

11 26. The record reveals that the Project will "worsen" traffic and triggers the application

12 of Measure E contained in the General Plan. The IS/MND concluded, without substantial

13 evidence, that the "alternative" mitigation measures of re-routing Project traffic over private

14 roadways would somehow reduce the Project's impacts to a level of insignificance.

15 27. Mitigation 1 proposed in the Traffic Study for the intersection of Pleasant Valley
16 Road/Racquet Way indicates that installation of signal would improve the intersection from
17 LOS F to LOS B. The Traffic Study goes on to propose an alternative of providing a public
18 road connection to Diamond Road, by way of Black Rice Road (a private road) to purportedly
19 reduce the impacts. The Traffic Study does not provide any analysis and does not state to what

20 the LOS would be at this intersection as a result of this alternative mitigation measures. This is

21 insufficient under CEQA.

22 28. Mitigation 2 proposed in the Traffic Study for the intersection of Missouri Flat
23 Road/China Garden Road indicates that installation of a signal would improve the intersection

24 to LOS C. The Traffic Study goes on to propose an alternative of restricting access on the

25 eastbound and westbound approaches to left-in, right-in/right-out only to purportedly reduce

26 the impacts. The Traffic Study does not provide any analysis and does not state to what the

27 LOS would be at this intersection as a result of this alternative mitigation measure. This is

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 6

- insufficient under CBQA. Also, the Findings for the Project do not mention the alternative

2 mitigation measure of restricting traffic at this intersection.
m 7 1000 29, The IS/MND also failed to analyze the impacts to the Missouri Flat Interchange
on Highway 50, which is also operating a LOS F. The Traffic Study fails to even mention the
interchange, and the County's records are rife with evidence that the Missouri Flat Interchange
on a U.S. 50 will operate at a LOS E and F in the 2035 scenario. Traffic studies from other
projects, such as Piedmont Oak Estates show this LOS for the Interchange, and there is no
co reason why it would be any different in the analysis of this Project. The public and

9 decisionmakers were not provided with information regarding the Project's impacts at the

10 Interchange because it was not reviewed or discussed.

11 30. The IS/ MND also fails to analyze the cumulative traffic impacts by addressing

12 the foreseeable projects in the vicinity of the Project.

13 31. The record shows that there is substantial evidence of to support a fair argument

14 that the Project will have significant traffic impacts.

15 B. Impacts to Fire Safety:

16 32. The record reveals that the Project may have significant impacts to safety of

17 existing residences and to the residents of the Project. The IS/MND fails to adequately address

18 the Project's failure to comply with fire safety regulations, including the fact that it will have

19 half of the required setback of 30 feet.

20 33. The Project's location on the property will result in existing neighborhoods and

21 residents of the Project being forced to live with dead ends in an area where wildfire could

22 destroy homes and take lives.

23 34. The analysis of impacts to fire safety failed to take into account the shortcomings

24 of existing roadways that would be part of any escape route for Project residence, as well as the

25 route for fire equipment and personnel to reach the Project. The record shows that roadways in

26 the existing neighborhood do not meet fire regulation standards for width, and none of these

27 issues was even considered or discussed in the IS/MND.

7 28
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

C. Impacts to wetlands on the Project site:

35. The IS/MND notes that the Project site includes 3 wetlands, and then goes on to
conclude, without any discussion, that the Project will not impact any of them. The record

reveals that at least one Project parking area would abut one of the wetlands with no setback at
all. The other two wetlands are not even identified on the Project site plans.

36. The IS/MND failed to consider the Project's impacts to these sensitive areas, and

• 00 this failure to analyze and failure to discuss feasible setbacks and other mitigation measures
violates CEQA.

9 II. Cumulative Impacts

10 37. The cumulative impacts analyses in the IS/MND for all areas of impact are

11 inadequate because the IS/MND fails to consider foreseeable development that will contribute

12 to various impacts, including noise, air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, traffic and public

13 utilities and services.

14 38. The IS/MND fails to employ any acceptable form of cumulative impacts analysis.

15 CEQA requires that the lead agency use either the "list" method or the "summary of

16 projections" to evaluate cumulative impacts. (CEQA Guidelines § 15130(b)(1)(A) and (B).)

17 The IS/MND does not discuss past, present and probable future projects, nor does it rely upon

18 projections in a recent planning document. The required cumulative impacts analysis is missing

19 from the IS/MND.

20 III. Other CEQA violations:

21 39. Respondents inappropriately deferred the performance of necessary

22 investigations, studies or inquiry with respect to the development of mitigation measures and

23 provided no performance standards, criteria or specific guidance with respect to future studies
24 used to develop mitigation measures.

25 40. The IS/MND fails to provide substantial evidence to support Respondents'

26 conclusions that the Project will not have a significant effect on the environment.

27 41. Respondents abused their discretion and failed to proceed according to law in that

28 they failed to require the preparation of an EIR for the project, despite the existence of a "fair
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 8

- argument" based on substantial evidence in the record, that the project may have a significant
N m t .o effect on the en vironment.

42. As a result of Respondents' failure to comply with the procedures required by
CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, a preemptory writ of mandate must issue ordering
Respondents to set aside its environmental findings and the related decision, and directing
Respondents to comply with the procedures mandated by CBQA and the CEQA Guidelines
before acting on any development proposal under the Project.
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

o- Violation of General Plan Laws Government Code §§ 65300 et seq.;
10 Code of Civil Procedure 1085

11 43. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 42.

12 44. Respondent County of El Dorado must ensure that the Project approval is

13 consistent with the statement of policies in the County General Plan.

14 45. The Project will increase traffic through the Courtside housing community over

15 roadways that are not capable of handling additional traffic. The Project will increase safety

16 risks in and around the Project area by increasing traffic on inadequate roadways and acting as

17 a trap for residents during a wildfire. Accordingly, the Project is inconsistent with General

18 Plan Policy 2.2.5.21.

19 46. The voters of El Dorado County passed Measure E during the last election, and E

20 that Measure amended the General Plan policies relating to mitigation of traffic impacts.

21 47. Measure E requires that traffic from a residential development project of five or

22 more units or parcels shall not result in, or worsen, Level of Service F traffic congestion during

23 weekday, peak-hour periods on any highway, road, interchange or intersection in the

24 unincorporated areas of the County.

25 48. Under the requirements of the Measure E, developer paid traffic impact fees

26 combined with any other available funds shall fully pay for building all necessary road

27 capacity improvements to fully offset and mitigate all direct and cumulative traffic impacts

28 from new development during peak hours upon any highways, arterial roads and their
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 9

intersections during weekday, peak hour periods in unincorporated areas of the county. Instead
N m t of requiring the appropriate mitigation, Respondents included "alternative" mitigation
measures that are not supported by data and/or analysis, and the resulting LOS is not even
revealed. This approach falls short of the General Plan requirements.
49. Approval of the Project without the necessary mitigation measures was arbitrary,
capricious, an abuse of discretion and a failure to proceed by law.
50. Because the Project is inconsistent with the El Dorado County General Plan,
cg Respondents' approval of the Project violated State Planning and Zoning Law and must be set

9 aside.

PRAYER 10

11 Wherefore, Petitioner respectfully requests the following relief and entry of judgment as
12 follows:

13 1. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to vacate
14 and set aside the approval of the Mitigated Negative Declaration and approval of the Project
15 and to withdraw the Notice of Determination for the Project;
16 2. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing the County to comply
17 with CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, and the State Planning and Zoning Law and to take any
18 other action required by Public Resources Code section 21168.9 or as otherwise required by.
19 law;

20 3. For a stay and preliminary and permanent injunction restraining County and its
21 agents, employees, officers and representatives from undertaking any activity to implement the

22 Project in any way pending full compliance with CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, and the State

23 Planning and Zoning Law;

24 4. For a declaration that Respondents' actions in approving the Project violated
25 CEQA and the State Planning and Zoning Law as set forth above;

26 5, For Petitioner's attorneys' fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 and

27 other applicable authority;
