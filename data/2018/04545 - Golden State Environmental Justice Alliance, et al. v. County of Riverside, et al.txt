PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 1

P I. INTRODUCTION
2
1. This Petition concerns the Villages of Lakeview Development in the rural
M Lakeview/Nuevo community of unincorporated Western Riverside County. This case has been
4 before the Court before, in 2012, when the Court found that its environmental review was not
adequate in several areas and issued a writ of mandate regarding it. In response to the Court's
6 order, the County of Riverside apparently re-envisioned the planned development. It developed
7 a new alternative to the proposed development, and it issued several new studies, although those
8 studies continued to rely on outdated information. As revised, the Draft Environmental Impact
9 Report ("DEIR") analyzed a Project ("the Project") involving 11,350 units on roughly 2,800
10 acres ("the Project" or "PVMSP"), and several onsite alternatives, including an Alternative 7
11 (*Alternative 7"), which would "only" develop 8725 units on roughly the same amount of land.'
12 2. Figure 1 depicts the land area covered by the proposed Project. Figure 2 shows
13 the land area covered by Alternative 7, which is the project the Board of Supervisors approved.

II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE
25
5. This Court has jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and
26 1094.5. The Court has jurisdiction of CEQA matters under Pub. Resources Code sections 21168,
27

28 21168.5, and 21168.9. This Court has jurisdiction of State Planning and Zoning Law matters

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 4

1 under Government Code sections 65300 et seq.
2 6. Venue is proper in this Court because the County comprises Riverside County and
3 the Project is located here, so the actions giving rise to the causes of action herein transpired in
4 Riverside County and the Project or Alternative 7's impact would be felt here. See Code of Civil
5 Procedure sections 393 and 394.
6
7. This action is timely filed within 30 days of posting the Notice of Determination
7 under CEQA on December 12, 2017.
8
8. Petitioners have exhausted their administrative remedies by commenting on the
Project and Alternative 7 prior to the close of the public hearing on the Project before the filing
10 of the Notice of Determination, in compliance with Public Resources Code section 21177(b).
11
9. Petitioners have complied with CEQA by filing and serving with this Petition for
12 Writ of Mandate a Notice of Intent to File under Pub. Resources Code section 21167.5 (a copy of
13 which is attached as Exhibit A), and by complying with Public Resources Code section 21167.6
14 in notifying the County of Petitioner's election to prepare the administrative record, and in
15 notifying the Attorney General of the commencement of this action under Pub. Resources Code
16 section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388.
17
III. PARTIES
18
10. Petitioner Golden State Environmental Justice Alliance ("GSEJA") is an
19

20 advocacy organization devoted to the preservation of the environment and the promotion of safe
and healthy communities. Constituents of GSEJA reside in Riverside County and would be
21 irreparably harmed by the Project's environmental impacts. GSEJA submitted comments on the
22 Project. GSEJA sues on behalf of the public and is acting as a private attorney general
23 conferring a significant benefit on the general public or a large class of persons under Code of a
24 Civil Procedure section 1021.5,
25 11. Petitioner Lynn Blickensderfer is an individual who recreates and has recreated in
26 the San Jacinto Wildlife Area ("SJWA") which the Project and Alternative 7 threaten to impact.
27 She submitted comments on the proposed development prior to the close of the official public
28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 5

comment period provided by Respondent County of Riverside.
2
12. Respondent County of Riverside ("County") is a public entity a located in Riverside
3 County and the lead agency for the Project under CEQA. County is the agency charged with the
4 authority of regulating and administering land use and development within its territory in
5 compliance with its General Plan and zoning ordinances and applicable provisions of state law
6 including CEQA. As the lead agency for the Project, the County is charged with the duty of
7 ensuring compliance with these applicable laws.
8
13. Respondent Board of Supervisors of Riverside County ("Board of Supervisors")
9 is the entity with the ultimate authority for deciding upon land use in the County.
10 14. Real Party in Interest Nuevo Development Co., LLC, is a Delaware limited a
11 liability company listed as the Project Applicant on Respondent County of Riverside's Notice of
12 Determination.
13 15. Real parties in interest Does 1-25 are sued herein by fictitious name. Their true
14 name and capacity are unknown to Petitioner. When their true name and capacity are
15 ascertained, Petitioners will amend this Petition by inserting their true name and capacity.
16 Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that the fictitiously named Real Parties
17 are responsible in some manner for the occurrences alleged herein.
18 16. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that each of the Real
19 Parties gave consent to, ratified, or authorized the acts alleged, and that each of the Real Parties
20 knowingly aided, abetted or conspired with the others to commit the acts alleged herein.
21 IV. STATEMENT OF FACTS AND COMMON ALLEGATIONS
22 17. The Villages of Lakeview Development; the County's Refusal to Update Its
23 Studies and Its Reliance on an 11 ½ Year Old Notice of Preparation; Notice of Related Case.
24 This isn't the first Petition to challenge the Villages of Lakeview development, and it probably
25 will not be the last. The development was originally proposed in a Notice of Preparation issued
26 July 21, 2006 which engendered significant public opposition. The County approved
27 development nonetheless ("the 2010 Project"), in March of 2010, and several petitioners filed
28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 6

-

2 challenges to the development. On May 16, 2012, this the Court invalidated the environmental

3 review for that development scenario, and the County issued a Draft EIR for a new land a use plan

4 for both the Project and for Alternative 7. Despite these changes, the County relied on years-old

5 studies, often dating to the Notice of Preparation ("NOP) for the original project.

18.
6 The County should have issued a new NOP for this Project, because (1)

7 recirculation is only appropriate before certification, and the former EIR for this development

8 was already certified, and then invalidated, and (2) despite the County's assurances to the
contrary, the 2010 Project is not the same as the Project that was under review in the DEIR at

10 issue here. The County's failure to issue a new NOP represented a failure to proceed by law, and

11 it deprived the public and responsible and other agencies of the opportunity to review and

12 comment on the DEIR, as a new NOP would have better informed the DEIR's scope and
purpose.2
13
19.
14 However, the development is largely the same as that which was at issue in the

15 earlier case before this Court, Friends of the Northern San Jacinto Valley v. County of Riverside,

16 No. RIC10007572 (Judgment dated July 11, 2012).

20.
17 The DEIR was inadequate, and the County's mitigation was inadequate as to

18 biological resources, greenhouse gases, air quality, land use and planning, energy impacts,

19 hazards, traffic, water resources and hydrology, and other issues. Alternative 7 conflicted with

20 the General Plan, and the County's actions in amending its General Plan created internal

21 inconsistencies within its General Plan. The adoption of Alternative 7 and the attendant mid-

22 cycle amendments to the General Plan violated Riverside County Ordinance 348. Alternative 7

23 also ran counter to Riverside County Ordinance 663.10 because the County was required to

24 actually mitigate on-site for the Stephens kangaroo rat ("SKR"), or at least to consider doing so,

25 and it did not. For all these reasons, Alternative 7 and the DEIR it relies upon should be

invalidated.
26

27 2

28 The County relied upon Public Resources Code section 21080.4 which says absolutely nothing about either relying on an old notice of preparation for a certified EIR to recirculate, or recirculating an EIR for a changed project.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 7

P 21. The Smart Growth Principles and the Riverside County Vision. The DEIR and
2 the County tried to distort the Smart Growth Principles endorsed by the Smart Growth Network
3 to fall within them. However, neither the Project nor Alternative 7 comply with these Principles
4 largely because "Smart Growth directs development toward communities already served by
|| infrastructure," and encourages "development in existing areas," as the Center for Biological
Diversity noted. As the comment continued, goals of the Smart Growth Principles included
7 "reduced development pressure in fringe areas, and preservation of farmland and open space."
8 The Project and Alternative 7 were both directly contrary to these goals. Among the goals of the
Principles which the County failed to meet here were to:
10 "Preserve open space, farmland, natural beauty, and critical environmental areas,"
11 "Strengthen and direct development towards existing communities,"
12 "Provide a variety of transportation choices,"
13 "Make development decisions predictable, fair and cost effective," and
14 "Encourage community and stakeholder collaboration in development decisions."
15 None of these objectives were met by the proposed Project/Alternative 7, which both called for
16 significant amendments to the General Plan and engendered massive outcry from the public.
17 22. The Project/Alternative 7 were both also contrary to the Draft Vision Concepts of
18 the 2015 General Plan, as they broke with Principle 12 ("Development standards are consistently
19 high ... This is possible because the places where development should occur are clearly
20 defined'), Principle 13 ("Infill and redevelopment are contributing to the accommodation of
21 growth"), and Principle 14 (providing for a "comprehensive transportation system [that] operates
22 at regional, countywide, community and neighborhood scales"). The County asserted that
23 Appendix N "extensively discusses the project's consistency with General Plan goals and
24 policies," but its Response to Comments in the FEIR did not address consistency with the
25 Riverside County Vision, and neither does the Appendix address consistency with the Vision
26 document, and the Vision is meant to apply as to all projects.
27 CEQA ISSUES
28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 8

23. Biological Resources. The County's DEIR was inadequate for failing to provide
2 an adequate baseline, failing to assess impacts to species covered by the Western Riverside
3 County Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan ("MSHCP"), failing to comply with the
4
MSHCP, and failing to assess impacts to species not covered by the MSHCP. The DEIR further
5 did not adequately address the impacts of development north of the Ramona Expressway or
consider alternatives with fewer impacts, and it did not consider the increased risk it of traffic to
7 wildlife. The County also did not adopt all feasible mitigation measures for biological resources.

24. Inadequate Baseline. The DEIR failed to establish an adequate baseline because

10 it relied on studies that were over ten years old to characterize the biota present or potentially

11 present on the site. Those studies relied on inadequate surveys.

25.
12 For example, the DEIR relied on surveys from 2004 and 2005 for rare plants,

13 even though 2004 was a drought year. There was also inadequate information in the DEIR or

14 Appendices to allow reviewers to conclude the surveys were adequate. Regarding animal

15 species, the DEIR relied on outdated biological surveys as well; most were done nine to 11 years

16 prior. None of the survey details of the "general biological surveys" were provided in the DEIR

17 or the Appendices, and it was impossible to determine the level of effort to find special status

18 species. There was no reporting of survey dates, times of day, duration, locations, methodology

19 or surveyor qualifications. Further there was no reporting of survey methods for any potentially

20 occurring species of bat or nocturnal owl. There was no reporting of survey methods used to

21 detect hard-to-find reptiles or amphibians. There was no reporting of survey methods used to

22 detect diurnal species of birds. As Petitioner GSEJA's expert commented, "the biological

23 foundation for the project review appears to be outdated, highly cursory, and poorly reported."

26.
24 Petitioner's expert provided evidence of more than the number of special status

25 species the County had identified on the site, but the County contended this was only because he

26 categorized them differently. The County's explanations did not cover all the other species

27 Petitioner's expert identified, however: the DEIR did not recognize at least these species as

28 potentially present: the two-striped garter snake, the south coast garter snake, the pallid bat, the

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 9

Townsend/western big-eared bat, the Western yellow bat, and the pocketed free-tailed bat.
2
27. Petitioner's expert asserted the site should be characterized for special status

4 species with potential to occur through protocol level surveys to determine species absence. The

5 County responded that CEQA did not encompass the precautionary principle, however, without
the required surveys there was no basis for concluding the species were absent.3
6
28.
7 The County claimed it did not have to survey for "Covered Species Adequately

8 Conserved" under the MSHCP, but (1) there was inadequate evidence of surveys regarding any

9 species, and (2) the MSHCP does not provide that surveys are not required, it merely provides

10 for mitigation fees as opposed to other forms of mitigation in some cases.

29.
11 Recirculation. The Alternatives Analysis in the FEIR disclosed that the total

12 acreage devoted to conservation north of the Ramona Expressway under Alternative 7 would be
47 acres, rather than 67.3, and Alternative 7 would impact 1.16 acres of unvegetated riverine
13 associated with nine, not three, features. This is a
14 features, not the previously stated 0.03

15 significant impact requiring recirculation.

30. The DEIR should also have been recirculated to reflect the FEIR's demonstrating
16

17 an increase in MSHCP riverine areas from 0.13 acres to 1.37 acres, and because the DEIR did

18 not accurately characterize the amount of jurisdictional waters present on the site.

31. Failure to Assess Impacts to Species Covered by the MSHCP. The DEIR largely
19

20 abdicated its role of analyzing impacts to species covered by the MSHCP because compliance

21 with the fee requirements of the MSHCP was sufficient for "Covered Species Adequately

22
3

23 With respect to one special status species Petitioner's expert said could be present on the site, the American badger, the County flatly stated that "the development footprint does not

24 contain suitable habitat for the badger." The County had no basis for why it reached this conclusion, other than to assert that the badger was only present in "dry, open, treeless

25 regions, prairies [or] parklands." There was no basis for concluding that these sorts of areas were not present on the site. DEIR 5.4-53, FEIR 2-780 (Response to Comment 1-14).

26 With respect to another species potentially present on the site, the southern grasshopper mouse, Petitioner's expert commented that the survey effort was not sufficient to detect the
27 mouse because it has a different diet and requires more extensive trapping efforts than the Los Angeles pocket mouse. The County responded that the grasshopper mouse would be
28 primarily located in the Lakeview Mountains, but provided no basis for this conclusion, and Petitioner's expert's comment presented substantial uncontradicted evidence to the contrary.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 10

1

2 Conserved." However, the MSHCP does not absolve lead agencies from analyzing impacts, it
only allows that the payment of fees can be mitigation in some cases. The analysis in the DEIR

4 needed to address special status species because the analyses in the MSHCP was programmatic.

5 The County claimed that compliance with the MSHCP mitigation measures was enough, but this

6 a isn't clear as a legal matter, and it is not clear that the DEIR's mitigation measures adequately

7 complied with the MSHCP either.

32.
8 The Project/Alternative 7 would have significant and far-ranging impacts on

9 species and the County should have made a mandatory finding of significance for "substantially

10 reduc[ing] the habitat of a fish or wildlife species, caus[ing] a fish or wildlife population to drop

11 below self-sustaining levels, threaten[ing] or eliminate[ing] a plant or animal community, [or]

12 reduc[ing] the number or restricting the range of an endangered, rare or threatened species."

13 CEQA Guidelines § 15065(a). The Project/Alternative 7 had the potential to do these things, and

14 the DEIR had to engage in full disclosure regarding them despite the MSHCP.
33.
15 As the Center for Biological Diversity pointed out, the DEIR does not adequately

16 analyze the impacts on water quality and biological resources from residential use of pesticides

17 and chemicals, including heavy metals.* The FEIR simply contended that "regulatory

18 compliance" would comply with CEQA, suggesting that limits on pesticide use developed as a

19 baseline to protect people in developed areas will protect against environmental impacts in the

20 environmentally sensitive areas of the SJWA and Lakeview Mountains. There simply was no

support for this conclusion.5
21
34.
22 The DEIR further failed to adequately assess or mitigate for the impacts of night

23 With respect to heavy metals, the County claimed that impacts to species would be less than

24 significant based on compliance with the California Toxics Rule. There was no evidence to support such a conclusion.

25 Further, commenters pointed out that EPA regulations permitted two pesticides of concern which the County concluded would be phased out and would not have an impact:
26 chlorpyrifos and diazinon. Several conservation groups pointed out that these pesticides continued to be available even though they might be regulated in name by the Department of
27 Pesticide Regulation. The County's Response to Comments also suggested that the DEIR said that these pesticides were not detected in urban runoff. This was false. The Geosyntec
28 TVOL Water Quality Technical Report conceded that diazinon was detected in "less than" 15 % of samples, or almost 1/6 of the time. PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 11

2 lighting on the SJWA and the Lakeview Mountains, where street lighting as close as 50 feet

3 supposedly would not create significant impacts, and other lighting could be even closer. The
Wildlife Agencies questioned the DEIR's conclusions; the County did not adequately respond to
4

5 comments on this issue. The increased lighting would have impacts on birds, as Petitioner's
expert biologist noted.
6
35.
7 The County eliminated plans for a low berm to allow "infrequent high flows" to
spill into the vernal pool area west of Davis Road and eliminated the DEIR's statement that the
8

9 drainage system was designed to approximate pre-development flows into the vernal pool. The

10 Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board brought this up and the County asserted the

11 flows would be maintained, but there was no mitigation measure or condition of approval that

12 said this, and the DEIR's language asserting that flows would remain the same was deleted from

the FEIR.
13
36.
14 The DEIR stated that it would permanently conserve 100% of the locations that

15 provided long term conservation value for the Coulter's goldfields, smooth tarplant, and thread-

16 leaved brodiaea, but how this conclusion was reached or what assessments supported it were not

17 identified. The DEIR also failed to address changes to drainage onsite and how those changes

18 would affect soil alkalinity for the rare plants it said it would preserve.

37.
19 Regarding the burrowing owl, the DEIR asserted that impacts would be less than

20 significant through implementation of measures MIM Bio 4 (preconstruction surveys and

21 relocation) and MM Bio 10 (payment of MSHCP fees). As the Center for Biological Diversity

22 pointed out, none of these measures would necessarily be sufficient considering the 95.2%

23 decline in the burrowing owl population in the Southwestern Interior area between the 1991-

24 1993 surveys and those from 2006-2007.
38. Finally,
25 commenters raised that the MSHCP was likely to fail based on a RAND

26 corporation study disclosing that the MSHCP was significantly underfunded. The DEIR did not

27 address impacts to species considering this analysis. The County in the FEIR asserted this

28 wasn't the County's problem, but it was in fact the problem of all participants in the MSHCP

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 12

2 considering their reliance upon it to supposedly reduce or eliminate impacts.

39. Impacts to All Species. The DEIR repeatedly contended, regarding both species
covered by the MSHCP and species not covered, that the existence of habitat off the site meant
4

5 that the elimination of habitat on the site was not significant. There was no basis for these

conclusions.
6
40. Also, the DEIR failed to address the threats to the SJWA and the Lakeview
7
Mountains wildlife from increase human presence such as the possibility that humans will poison
8

9 endangered species by putting out poison for coyotes, or that humans would put out food for

10 other animals which would tend to benefit invasive species over native ones.

41.
11 The DEIR inadequately analyzed impacts to the SKR by stating that the Project

12 will be mitigated by payments to the SKR Habitat Conservation Plan ("HCP"). The DEIR failed

13 to address the SKR population on the site, and failed to adequately assess it, though at least 10

14 SKR had been discovered (apparently inadvertently) on the site. Finally, as to the SKR, the
DEIR did not address the risk to them because of rodenticides used onsite.
15
42.
16 Petitioner GSEJA's expert biologist commented that the DEIR had improperly

17 claimed that 11 special status species should not be covered, three because they were considered

18 "transient" on the site, when uses other than rookeries such as foraging or resting are necessary
to the survival of the species.

20 The DEIR dismissed the potential impacts to the coast patch-nosed snake, rosy

21 boa, San Bernardino ring-necked snake and silvery legless lizard because they were not detected

22 during general or focused surveys, but the extent of the survey efforts was not disclosed, and

23 Petitioner's expert noted the surveys were probably not done at night or with adequate

24 implements. The County dismissed the possibility of the species being present as significant

25 because the amount of habitat at issue being small and less than 10% relative to the amount of

26 habitat to be avoided. This was not substantial evidence, particularly absent surveys disclosing

27 where the species were.

44.
28 The DEIR failed to provide an adequate cumulative impacts analysis on

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 13

-

2 biological resources; the DEIR's "analysis" consisted of "convenient speculation, leading to

3 unfounded conclusions," in the words of Petitioner's biologist. The DEIR concluded both that

4 the non-MSHCP species were "generally abundant," and that "significant populations do not

5 occur within the development footprint," which were convenient statements for the developer,
but had no basis given that no focused surveys (and no general surveys with sufficient

7 documentation to allow reliance upon them) had been done.

45.
8 Finally, the DEIR should have assessed impacts from the Project combined with

9 the drought. The County contended this was an impact of the environment on the Project but it

10 was an impact of the Project considering existing conditions.

46.
11 Failure to Comply with MSHCP. The County claimed that the Project complied

12 with the MSHCP because there was a Joint Project Review (JPR") for the earlier 2010 Project

13 this Court invalidated. However, both the Project and Alternative 7 are different projects from

14 the one reviewed. Further, the County had to set aside all approvals of the Villages of Lakeview

15 2010 Project, and therefore the JPR has no continuing effect.

47.
16 The Errata to the Specific Plan for Alternative 7 claimed that it eliminated all

17 MSHCP-Prohibited Plant List Species. It did not; the European Olive was still listed for
it is a reflected as a Prohibited Species.6 use and

18
48.
19 The DEIR failed to adequately protect the Coulter's goldfields, smooth tarplant,

20 and thread-leaved brodiaea.

21 49. Petitioner's biologist concluded that the least Bell's vireo, the southwestern

22 willow flycatcher and the San Bernardino kangaroo rat should have received focused surveys

23 under the MSHCP, but they did not because the County baselessly concluded that they had no

24 suitable habitat or a low occurrence likelihood.

50.
25 The Los Angeles pocket mouse was inadequately surveyed for, too long ago, in

26 2004 and 2007. The trapping effort was limited to 5.67 acres, and the area for mitigation was

27 6

28 The DEIR also did not adequately protect the Stephens' kangaroo rat ("SKR"), which is subject to another Habitat Conservation Plan, for reasons discussed further with respect to noncompliance with Ordinance 663.10 below.

2 based on that area, when the County had no basis for concluded whether the mouse occupied a
more extensive domain. The County responded that the MSHCP does not require surveys for all

4 Los Angeles pocket mouse occupied area but only in MSHCP survey areas. This may be true on

5 mitigation but not necessarily characterization of the site.

51.
6 The DEIR claimed that it complied with MSHCP provisions relating to the

7 burrowing owl, however, it failed to identify significant mitigation measures under the MSHCP

8 that were required if they were detected. Further, Petitioner's biologist contended that the

9 County should have complied with the statewide 2012 CDFW Staff Burrowing Owl Mitigation
memorandum; the County concluded it did not need to without a substantial evidence basis. The
10

11 degree of survey effort was inadequate under the 2012 Staff memorandum both for the 2007 and

12 2013 surveys. Finally, the DEIR should have addressed impacts to the burrowing owl

13 considering impacts from the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan and its projected

14 cumulative loss of more than half of the State's burrowing owl population.' The County claimed

15 it did not have to address statewide impacts citing no statute or guideline to that effect.

52.
16 Development North of the Ramona Expressway, Edge effects from development

17 near wildlife areas are well documented, as commenters noted. The DEIR failed to properly

18 identify the impacts from commercial uses north of the Ramona Expressway as to Alternative 7.

19 Numerous commenters proposed that the County prohibit development of any kind in this area to

20 limit impacts to the SJWA. There was no reason to believe that commercial as opposed to

21 residential development would have fewer impacts; there could be greater impacts from noise

22 and lighting, among other things. The self-storage facility proposed by the developer after the

23 FEIR was circulated does nothing to allay Petitioners' concerns, as such facilities can generate

24 trash, noise and light, and there still were no assurances on how impacts from feral cats and dogs

25 related to Alternative 7 would be limited. The statement of compliance with County noise and

26 light standards was insufficient to reduce impacts to this sensitive area.

53. Traffic risks. The DEIR did not address the increased risk to wildlife due to
27

28 As noted above, another commenter had also observed that over 95% of the burrowing owls in the region had apparently disappeared between 1993 and 2007 according to surveys.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 15

2 traffic associated with the Project, or Alternative 7. The County claimed it had adequately

3 mitigated because it had supposedly complied with the MSHCP's guidelines to minimize edge
effects. The Wildlife Agencies (the California Department of Fish and Wildlife ("CDFW") and
4

5 U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (*USFWS")) apparently did not agree, and the DEIR had to

6 evaluate impacts even if it had supposedly adequately mitigated. Further, there were no

7 mitigations related to traffic impacts to wildlife for the Project or Alternative 7.

54. Inadequate Mitigation. Under MM Bio 3, the County asserted that the
8 Project/Alternative 7 CC&R's would restrict cat ownership to indoors, but this was only so north

10 of the Ramona Expressway or within 500 feet of the Lakeview Mountains, which isn't sufficient

11 to prevent predation because cats can obviously move beyond 500 feet out of doors, and there

was
12 nothing in the mitigation measure regarding enforcement. And there was nothing in the

13 mitigation measure to prevent predation by feral or domestic dogs, although the MSHCP

14 identified this as an issue for the bobcat, the Southern California rufous-crowned sparrow, the

15 northwestern San Diego pocket mouse, the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the Belding's orange-

16 throated whiptail, the granite spiny lizard, and the northern red-diamond rattlesnake. Precluding

17 ownership of more than two dogs was hardly sufficient.

55. MM Bio 4 did not demonstrate compliance with either the MSHCP guidelines or
18

19 the 2012 Burrowing Owl Mitigation Staff Report.

56. The mitigation measures under MM Bio 11, the Environmental Stewardship
20

21 Program, were inadequate. The California Department of Fish & Wildlife ("CDFW") argued

22 that Alternative 7 should fund an additional staff person just to deal with the impacts of

23 Alternative 7 on the SJWA (and the Lakeview Mountains). CDFW requires a 3-year
commitment for staff persons. The Environmental Stewardship Program did not provide for
24 such funding, and only specified that funds would go to the Lakeview Community Services
25

26 Organization, without specifying how much those funds would be, other than to indicate that

27 there would be $100,000 in funding from the first 500 units. This was insufficient to protect the

28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 16

2 critical resources at issue.8 The Center for Biological Diversity further noted that reliance on an

3 education program simply was not sufficient to conclusively reduce impacts to a less than

4 significant level. Further, regarding MM Bio 11b, there simply were no provisions to enforce

5 the Integrated Pest Management program, and the assumption that the thousands of residents

6 would voluntarily comply with any minimum action levels was not based on substantial

evidence.
7
57.
8 The DEIR also inaccurately claimed that the Project's cumulative impacts would

9 be reduced to less than significant levels based on the mitigation measures, but the mitigation of

10 direct impacts does not mean that cumulative impacts are eliminated.

58.
11 Greenhouse Gas Impacts. The DEIR improperly assessed impacts under all

12 possible standards, and did not impose adequate mitigation.

59.
13 Improper Evaluation of Impacts. The County claimed that its analysis comported

14 with various "pathways to compliance" under the guidance of the Supreme Court in Center for

15 Biological Diversity v. Dept. of Fish & Wildlife (2015) 62 Cal. 4th 204 ("CBD v. DFW'). Its
analysis was flawed in
16 every case.

60.
17 No Substantial Evidence for a Direct Comparison of Purported Reductions to the

18 AB 32 Scoping Plan Target. First, the DEIR and FEIR purported to conduct a direct comparison

19 between the AB 32 Scoping Plan's target percentage reduction for statewide emissions and those

20 of the Project/Alternative 7. This analysis was not supported by substantial evidence and

21 represented a failure to proceed by law, as the Supreme Court clarified in CBD v. DFW that an

22 agency must have substantial evidence to support its conclusion that the Scoping Plan target and

23 the project target are the same, and the County had no support for such a conclusion here.9 The

24 DEIR failed to explain why higher reduction target from the Project/Alternative 7 should not

25 8 Petitioner GSEJA further raised that the Program should require an endowment such that it

26 would be funded in perpetuity. The County responded that "Funding of the measures noted in the comment does not affect the analysis and conclusions in the EIR" without any basis.
9
27 As the Supreme Court has recognized twice, GHG evaluation requirements are evolving according to law, and the DEIR here further failed to adequately assess compliance with SB
28 32, Executive Order B-30-15, or Executive Order S-3-05 despite the long-term impacts of the Project/Alternative 7.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 17

have been required compared to that for overall statewide reductions in the Scoping Plan,
2

3 contrary to CBD v. DFW.

61. Second, the DEIR improperly quantified GHG reductions by making unsupported
assumptions, and thereby significantly misled (or sought to mislead) the public and
5 decisionmakers regarding the impacts of the Project/Alternative 7. The improper calculations
6
included:
7 The DEIR posited Project 2020 GHG emissions at 249,622 MTCO2e/year before
8

9 mitigation, and Alternative 7 GHG emissions at 212,363 before mitigation. By

10 far the largest component in each figure was related to Traffic. See DEIR Tables

11 5.16-B, 7-Z. However, it appears emissions related to Traffic were significantly

12 underestimated because the County's consultant improperly used the MXD model

13 for mixed use developments 1o and thereby concluded that average VMT would be

14 20.6 miles for the Project and 20.3 miles for Alternative 7. These figures are not

credible."
15

16 The DEIR further took a 1% reduction for Traffic Demand Management relating

17 a to a Commute Trip Reduction Program, and this was not based on substantial

18 evidence since there was no evidence of funding for this Program or how it would

19

20 10 As numerous commenters noted, the MXD model was inappropriate for use in a far-flung rural area, and the County's consultant, who developed the model, should have known better

21 than to use it, given that the Project and Alternative 7 exceeded the maximum 5,000 residential units it was meant to cover.

11
22 First, the County's CEQA documentation is equivocal as to whether this average VMT
calculation is for one leg of an external trip or for both. The Errata to the County's TIA
23 disclose that only one leg of external trips was evaluated, and the County's Response to Comments indicating that the Project is within 20 miles of Riverside, Moreno Valley, Lake
24 Elsinore, Hemet, and Menifee similarly suggests that the County was only evaluating one- way distances. Given that the Project and Alternative 7 would place thousands of residents at
25 significant distances from their work, both legs should have been counted for GHG and air quality purposes, and if the County's conclusion of 20.3 miles of average VMT for
26 Alternative 7 or 20.6 miles for the Project were two-way figures, they simply were not believable.

27 Second, it appears that the County double-counted in its internal trip capture analysis with respect to single-family homes, as discussed in the Traffic section of this petition.

2 be managed.

3 The DEIR, as revised in the FEIR, posited a yearly reduction of 9,144 MTCO2e

4 for the installation of electric vehicle ("EV") chargers for the Project (or 6,363

5 MTCO2e for Alternative 7, as stated in an Updated Air Quality Analysis

6 Appendix to the FEIR). Neither figure was based on substantial evidence, as they

7 would require more cars to charge at each station than could reasonably use such
stations, based upon other assumptions made regarding VMT in the Air Quality,
GHG and Traffic analyses for the Project/Alternative 7.12

10 The DEIR claimed a total reduction of 4,881 MTCO2e for solar photovoltaic

11 system installation for the Project (or 5,723 for Alternative 7, as stated in the Air

12 Quality Analysis Appendix to the FEIR), but this allowed for the purchase of

13 offsets that supposedly would provide the same benefits as the solar systems, even

14 though the County did not specify how long those offsets would be in effect, or

15 the standards by which they would be purchased. The County's responses to

16 another commenter suggested that it only intended to require those offsets to last

17 through 2030, as of which time the entire Project/Alternative 7 would not be built.

18 A Planning Commission Staff Report relying on the FEIR and Appendices

19 concluded there would be a reduction of 3,532 MTCOwe from 5600 single family

20 solar home systems, but Alternative 7 did not contain 5600 single family homes.

21 Further, the number of detached units for the Alternative 7 development would be

22 5035, not the 5610 posited in the Additional GHG Analyses.

23 The FEIR posited a 9,530 MTCO2e annual reduction for the removal of the

24 McAnally Chicken Ranch from the Project site, but this would be a one-time

25 occurrence, and should not have led to repeated annual reductions. And the

26 reduction should only have reflected the presence and removal of 250,000 hens,

27 as this was all that existed on the site at the time of the DEIR's evaluation.

28 12 The original Project as proposed in the DEIR did not comply with existing law in that it did not provide EV charging for 3% of the multifamily units.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 19

-4
The FEIR granted the Project an additional 4963 MTCO2e/year for
2
"Transportation Demand Management - Neighborhood Site Enhancements" when 3
there was essentially nothing in the FEIR or Appendices to support this. The 4
conclusion that the provision of bicycle parking and a "pedestrian access system"
5
would support such a reduction was not based on substantial evidence, 13 and there 6
was no support for how the County derived its 3.8% reduction figure in the DEIR, 7
the FEIR or the Appendices.
8
The TIA and the GHG analysis which relied upon it assumed that the schools on
the site would be built, even though there was no guarantee this was the case 10
because the local school district would have to purchase the sites within two years 11 on terms "reasonably acceptable to the developer." The developer had every 12
incentive to build more homes rather than selling school sites to a strapped public 13
agency. The County merely assumed the schools would be built.
14
The GHG emissions calculations were done for a date of 2020, as of which time
15 the Project/Alternative 7 would not even remotely be complete, so it isn't clear 16
what the County's consultant was calculating. As commenters pointed out, if the
17
calculations were done for 2030, as required by SB 32 and Executive Order B-30-
18
15, much greater reductions would have been mandated - specifically, a 40%
19 reduction below 1990 levels, which the County did not adequately demonstrate 20 the Project could achieve. 14 The County did not even attempt to demonstrate that 21

22 13 The County cited as its basis Appendix I to the Traffic Study ("TIA") and a memorandum it
23 cited as "Transportation Demand Management Vehicle Miles Traveled Reductions for the Villages of Lakeview Development Project (Fehr & Peers Jan. 29, 2015). To Petitioner
24 GSEJA's knowledge, this document was never made available to the public. Appendix I is apparently an earlier version of the memorandum, dated April 14, 2014. The County should
25 not be permitted to rely on a document it did not make available to the public.
14 For example, the County claimed that GHGs for the Project would be reduced by 5,829
26 MTCO2/year due to the installation of one charger for every 15 parking spaces for the multifamily units, but this assumption was based on an assumed 34,979,167 VMT/year
27 attributable to EV charging stations at the Project. This number would not be credible even if ten cars charged at each of the 383 multifamily stations each day, which is an outrageously
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 20

1
Alternative 7 would achieve these reductions. And the County refused to conduct
2 a 2050 analysis, despite the Supreme Court's conclusion that such an analysis is
3 scientifically mandated for large long-term projects like the present one, asserting
4

5 instead that such an analysis "is too speculative for purposes of determining
CEQA significance," and that Executive Order S-3-05 "has only the force and
6
effect of an Executive Order issued by a former Governor."
7
62. The DEIR's No Action Taken/Business As Usual ("NAT") Scenario improperly
8
assumed that the Project could be built in violation of several laws:
It presumed the Project could be built under twice-outdated, illegal building
10
standards such as existed in 2008
11

12 It presumed the Project could be built with an energy source mix that violated
California's 33% Renewable Portfolio Standard
13

14 It presumed it did not have to comply with California's Green Building Standards
which have been in effect since 2011.
15
63. No Substantial Evidence and Failure to Proceed by Law in Analyzing Climate
16
Action Plan Compliance. As another purported "pathway" to compliance under CBD v. DFW,
17

18 the County asserted that the Project/Alternative 7 complied with its Climate Action Plan

19 ("CAP"). But the calculations the County engaged in were grossly self-serving, not supported by
substantial evidence, and represented a failure to proceed by law. The failures in the County's
20
CAP calculations included:
21 The County took 48 points (and asserted it could take 440) for the installation of
22 EV chargers under Implementation Measures T7.A.1 and T7.B.1, based on 8
23
points per charger installed. However, the CAP, and certainly the CAP as it has
24
been revised in settlement of litigation concerning its adequacy, limits the points
25

26 optimistic assumption. The County was not even consistent with its numbers, asserting in its "Additional GHG Analysis" that the total 2030 GHG emissions were 18.4% lower than
27 projected 2020 emissions, and asserting in response to a commenter that they were 23.3% lower. Further, the analysis regarding SB 32 and Executive Order B-30-15 compliance
28 should have been in the DEIR, not in a small Appendix to the FEIR. And finally, there was effectively no backup to Table 7 in the Additional GHG Analyses.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 21

available for EV chargers to situations where the chargers are installed site-wide, 2 not per charger. Since EV chargers have not been installed site-wide in
compliance with the Implementation Measure, the County should have taken 0 4 points.15 n o A cO CAP Implementation Measure E5.B.6 allows the recovery of 12 points if at least
50% of in-unit fixtures are high-efficiency, specifically meaning that they produce
40 lumens/watt for 15 watt or less fixtures, 50 lumens/watt for 15-40 watt
fixtures, and 60 lumens/watt for fixtures greater than 40 watt. The County took 9 9 points for nonresidential development, which assumed that 25% of the fixtures
10 there would be compliant. CAP Implementation Measure E1.B.5 imposes similar
11 requirements as to residential lighting, and the County took credit as if 100% of 12 the residential fixtures complied. Mitigation Measure MM GHG 3 did not 13 require this level of efficiency either by its terms or regarding the percentage of 14 high-efficiency fixtures to be installed. Further, and more to the point, this
15 Implementation Measure has been superseded by the California Building Code 16 which requires this level of efficiency, so the County should have taken 0 points.
17 The County claimed it got 23.5 points for the Project, or 9.5 points for Alternative 18 7, for Implementation Measure T2.A.1 for increased density. However, it is 19 entirely unclear how the County arrived at these numbers. The County may have
20 simply added the points for each neighborhood above the 7-unit-per-acre 21 minimum, but such an approach would not be appropriate or consistent with the
22
intent of the CAP.
23 Appendix S for Alternative 7 took 2 points each for "solar ready" roofs for the
24 residential and nonresidential portions of the development. "Solar ready" roofs
25

26 15 The County claimed that Petitioner GSEJA's and others' comments taking issue with its giving itself 8 points per charger "appears to take issue with how the Riverside CAP
27 screening table is set up, but this is false. GSEJA and others took issue with how the County chose to interpret the CAP, which was not based on substantial evidence.

p
üpw N are now required by the California Building Code, so the points assigned by the

CAP should not be recovered.16

The Project also claimed credit for Energy Star appliances under Implementation

6 Measure E1.B.6. As the Center for Biological Diversity noted, the relevant

7 mitigation measure, MM GHG 2, did not require installation of Energy Star

8 64. appliances by the homebuilders; it also did not apply to all appliances.

9 Inconsistency with SB 375. In general, the Project and Alternative 7 were

10 inconsistent with SB 375 because they amended the General Plan to allow for more sprawling

11 development. In addition, the DEIR and FEIR's calculations purportedly showing that per capita

12 emissions were below a 19.5 lb/day emissions limit for the SCAG region were not supported

13 because (1) the 19.5 lb/day limit was based on an outdated California Air Resources Board

14 ("CARB") reduction percentage!7, (2) the County did not disclose the basis for its calculations,

15 and (3) what the County disclosed makes those calculations questionable.'8

65.

16 Compliance with Other GHG Laws and Regulations. The County also attempted

17 to assert that compliance with other greenhouse gas laws and regulations would be sufficient, but

18 CBD v. DFW does not so hold regarding a residential development, and the County mostly did

19 the minimum to comply with those other laws and regulations. Since the County found that

20 GHG impacts would be significant, it had to adopt all feasible mitigation. See Pub. Res. Code con

21 16 Revised Appendix O with respect to the Project took 20 points for residential solar

22 17 generation, and 8 points for commercial solar generation, even though the mitigation measures, MM GHG 26 and MM GHG 27, did not require solar generation, but allowed for

23 the purchase of offsets, which specifically was not contemplated in the CAP.

18 Before environmental review on the Project/Alternative 7 was complete, CARB proposed

24 upping the SB375 target from 18 percent to 21 percent.

25 The County disclosed that it derived per capita emissions by dividing by 365 days rather than the number of weekdays per year as used by the CARB. Additionally, it is impossible to

26 determine what vehicle miles traveled ("VMT") assumptions the per capita emissions calculations were based upon, and there were numerous problems with the presumed average

27 VMT figures of 20.6 miles for the Project and 20.3 for Alternative 7. Further, the County's CEQA documentation discloses that GHG emissions due to traffic overall would be a total of

28 201,230 MTCO2e, so the assumption that only 108,427 of this would relate to residential emissions was highly optimistic, and this assumption is further not borne out since 87.6% of Project traffic would be comprised of light- and medium-duty vehicles.

66.
3 Inadequate Mitigation. The County asserted that no further GHG mitigation was

4 feasible, but this was false:

5 Zero net energy ("ZNE") development is feasible and is required for construction

6 after 2019; the County easily could have required the developer to achieve this

N standard now.

8 The County applied the minimum building efficiency standards required under the

9 Title 24 for the Project/Alternative 7. The County could have applied LEED

10 standards.

11 While the County required offsets for solar power,20 the County could have

12 required the actual installation of solar power, or done far more to assure its

13 installation than it did, and the County could have mandated the installation of

14 solar power to the full capacity of the roofs.

15 The County could have required solar thermal power installations for water

16 heating. It only required such installations for 70% of community pools and spas

17 where such heating was "necessary or desired."

18 The County could have provided for the installation of more EV chargers, for

19 example, by providing them in single-family homes and in requiring installation

20 for a greater percentage of the non-residential parking spaces.

21 The County could have required the installation of Energy Star appliances.

22 The County could have imposed enforceable water recycling and conservation

23 measures.

24 The County could have required composting; the mitigation measures it imposed

25 only made it optional.

26

27 19 Further, the County was required to adopt all feasible mitigation measures before adopting a

20 statement of overriding considerations.

28 The Center for Biological Diversity correctly argued that the County should have required GHG mitigation on-site first, local second and out of state third, as SCAQMD guidance provides.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 24

The County could have required developers to minimize construction waste N m + beyond existing County standards.
The County could have prohibited hearths in the development; instead the
Project/Alternative 7 provided for installation of them within 89.5% of the homes
built.21

The County failed to address : list of mitigation measures proposed for GHG
7 mitigation by CAPCOA, the Air Pollution Control Officers' Association. See 8
Response to Comments I-30 and I-49.22
9
67. Further, the specific mitigation measures were inadequate. MM GHG 2
10

11 regarding Energy Star appliances was only applicable when the developer provided appliances,
and only regarding residences.
12
68. MM GHG 3 regarding energy efficient lighting issued a standard which only 13

14 required what the Code would require anyway, it did not specify what percentage of the

15 residential or commercial development it applied to, and it allowed for compact fluorescent
bulbs, which cause other problems.
16
69. The FEIR amended MM GHG 5 to essentially make it nonmandatory. It now
17
provides for "program(s) that will promote carpooling on the project site" which "may include" 18 ride matching through the HOA and school trip matching through the HOA, PTA or other
19
organization.
20
70. MM GHG provided for EV chargers in residential and nonresidential areas, 21

22 consisting of 1 charger for every 15 multifamily residential units (which equates to 6%
penetration, when the Building Code requires a 3% penetration anyway), and chargers for 2% of
23

24
21 While the County asserted that the fireplaces would be natural gas, this is required under 25 SCAQMD rules, and the DEIR estimated that natural gas fireplace use under Alternative 7 would lead to 1897 MTCO2e in emissions each year.
26 22 The County purported to provide a listing in Response to Comment I-65, however it did not
27 set forth the listing in sufficient detail to evaluate whether the Project's mitigation measures comported with them, it did not list those measures the County had not included in some
28 fashion, and it improperly concluded the County had complied with measures where it was clear that it had not.

7 MM GHG 10 says "Take advantage of daylight where feasible and consistent

8 with building purpose," but there was simply no evidence that the measure had changed or would

9 change design anywhere on the site.

73.
10 MM GHG 13 calls for the developers to provide transit; they cannot. The

11 County claimed that it will coordinate with the Riverside Transit Agency ("RTA") toward

12 providing transit, but there are no planned stops, and though the Development Agreement

13 provides for a Smart Shuttle service program, the provision is simply for the developer to pay up

14 to $40,000 per year for eight years only toward a vehicle or vehicles and labor, which may well

15 not sufficiently reduce commuting from the site for the roughly 28,000 residents.

74.
16 MMs GHG 26 and 27 could have required actual installation of solar systems,

17 rather than allowing offsets to substitute for such systems, measure MM GHG 26 failed to

18 specify how long the offsets would last for, and the County only intended that they last through

19 2030, but the measure was legally insufficient because it failed to specify how long offsets had to

20 last. Regarding MM GHG 27, providing that the developer was to make solar available to

21 residents, it would have been far more effective if the developer had to make those systems

22 available at cost, but the measure did not so require.

75.
23 MM GHG 28 for solar hot water heaters only applied to 70% of community pools

24 and spas, and only "where heating is necessary or desired," rather than mandating solar hot

25 water heating for residential or commercial development, as urged by commenters.

76.
26 The Center for Biological Diversity argued for the use of drought-tolerant plants

27 in lieu of turf. The County claimed it had complied through MM GHG 31, which provides for

28 50% native species and drought tolerant species in non-turf areas and excluding residential back

2 yards. The measure could have done much more.

77.
3 MM GHG 35-39 merely required the developer to create a website or websites to

4 advise residents or commercial tenants of GHG reduction measures they could engage in
voluntarily.

78.
6 Air Quality. Failure to Address the Court's Order. The DEIR did not address

7 the Court's Order that it analyze specific Project impacts to the general population and sensitive

8 receptors. The DEIR included no long-term analysis of operational impacts on sensitive

receptors
9 from increased air pollution.23 Also, the DEIR did not include analysis of any of the

10 commercial or industrial uses the Project/Alternative 7 envisioned. The FEIR stated that the

11 DEIR had determined that long-term criteria pollutant emission impacts on the general

12 population were less than significant, but this was simply false as to regional criteria pollutant

13 emissions, where the DEIR plainly disclosed significant exceedances of SCAQMD thresholds.

79.
14 Percentage Exceedance of Regional Thresholds. The DEIR included charts

15 showing Project and Alternative 7 projected regional emissions next to South Coast Air Quality

16 Management District ("SCAQMD") thresholds, but it did not disclose the percentage

17 exceedances. Commenters urged that this should have been included as a valuable metric, but a

18 the County disregarded the comments.

80.
19 The DEIR failed to assess how climate change will exacerbate the

20 Project/Alternative 7's air quality or biological resource impacts.

81.
21 Health Risk Assessments. The DEIR was circulated with Health Risk

22 Assessments ("HRAs") which did not respond to the basic question of what increased risk to

23 residents nearby the Project/Alternative 7 would face because of construction and increased

24 vehicle emissions. The Ramona Expressway HRA addressed the impacts of the Ramona

25 Expressway "on the Project in build out year 2035," which was not the proper question under

26 23 The DEIR did concede that the Project's emissions included "the potential to aggravate
27 chronic respiratory disease, decreased pulmonary function, aggravation of aspects of coronary heart disease, exacerbation of symptoms of respiratory or cardiovascular disease,
28 and increased risk in premature death," but the DEIR did not evaluate these risks to these sensitive groups.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 27

2 CEQA. The County offered a revised HRA with the FEIR, but nowhere does it appear that the

3 County assessed the cumulative impacts of the Project or Alternative 7 with other projects such

4 as the Mid County Parkway project. Further, there was no basis for concluding, as the DEIR did,

5 a that a 50% reduction in diesel particulate matter ("DPM") reaching households would
correspond to a 50% reduction in risk.
6
82.
7 Inadequate Mitigation. Commenters on the DEIR pointed out that the County

8 had provided only four mitigation measures regarding air quality (other than two aimed at

9 reducing health risks to future residents, MM AQ 5 and 624) - MMs AQ 1-4 and even those

10 lacked any adequate enforcement mechanisms.

83.
11 Of these, MM AQ 2 was inadequate because it did not require the use of Tier 4

12 construction equipment until 2030. As Petitioner GSEJA pointed out, the City of Los Angeles

13 has required such construction equipment as a mitigation measure for a project presently under

14 construction.25 MM AQ 3 only required electricity from power poles instead of from gasoline or

15 diesel generators during construction where the Department of Building & Safety determined it

16 was "feasible," which was undefined. The County further asserted that it could consider

17 economic factors in deciding whether power poles were feasible, without recognizing the

18 significant health and safety benefits that would flow from implementing the measure. Finally,

19 MM AQ 4 required "minimizing" vehicle idling times through traffic control measures

20 (*TCMs"), but such measures were not anywhere identified.

21 24 MM AQ 5 was inadequate because it should have, based on the DEIR's analysis, required a tiered vegetative barrier between the Ramona Expressway and the Project homes within 1300
22 feet of the Expressway, but it only required such landscaping within 500 feet. Further, the DEIR had relied on a study that showed that the planting of Deodar trees would reduce DPM,
23 but the mitigation measure did not require the use of these trees. MM AQ 6 was inadequate because it should have required air filtration within 1300 feet and only did so within 500 feet;
24 further, this was only for the owner-occupied units, and not for renters, where the measure only required a maximum efficiency reporting value ("MERV") "in accordance with
25 manufacturer's recommendations," which provided absolutely no assurances regarding freeway emissions reductions.
26 Both MM AQ 5 and MM AQ 6 for Alternative 7 further reduced the radius for mitigation

27 from 550 feet to 500 feet without any substantial evidence basis for doing so.
25 The County claimed that the measure "implements all the market has available," but there
28 was no substantial evidence in the record for this assertion. The County relied on a CARB Fact Sheet from 2011 to make its point.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 28

1
84.
2 In response to the criticism regarding the paucity of air quality mitigation

3 measures, the County responded by imposing a few other requirements on the construction of the

4 Project only. Among those was MM AQ 8, which provided that the developer was to encourage

5 contractors to apply for "Surplus Off Road Opt-in for NOx" ("SOON") Funds from the

6 SCAQMD. According to the SCAQMD, all large fleets a with a total horsepower of 20,000 must

7 apply for funding, SO it is likely this provision would be mandatory anyway unless the applicant

8 tried to subcontract to several sub-developers or sub-contractors to evade the requirement (which
is entirely possible).
9
85.
10 The County also refused to implement other mitigation measures including one

11 proposed by the agency responsible for air quality within the jurisdiction of the Project -

12 SCAQMD. Specifically, SCAQMD urged the County to limit haul trucks to construct the

13 Project to 2010 or later models. The County asserted that "the Project" does not have "control

14 over the haul trucks used by construction contractors." This entirely sidestepped the rather

15 obvious point that the County had such control, through the ability to impose conditions of

approval.
16
86.
17 Land Use and Planning. Inconsistency with General Plan. The Project and

18 Alternative 7 were both significantly inconsistent with the County's General Plan ("GP") in

19 either its 2003 version or its more recent 2015 version. First, in response to this Court's Order

20 concluding that the Project was inconsistent with 2003 GP Circulation Element Policy C 2.1,

21 which used to require the County to maintain certain levels of service, the County amended the

22 GP to eliminate that requirement. However, 2003 GP Policy LU 22.3 (and 2015 GP Policy LU

23 28.3), which requires adequate circulation facilities to meet demands of a proposed residential

24 use, effectively still require adequate levels of service, and approving Alternative 7 violates these

Policies.
25
87.
26 2003 GP Policy LU 12.1, reiterated as 2015 GP Policy LU 13.1, states that the

27 County should "Provide land use arrangements that reduce reliance on the automobile and

28 improve opportunities for pedestrian, bicycle, and transit use to minimize congestion and air

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 29

2 pollution." As commenters pointed out, the Project and Alternative 7 did the opposite by placing

3 a residential community in the middle of nowhere.26 Appendix N to the DEIR conceded that

4 "the placement of the project beyond an abundance of jobs and services will necessitate a
continued reliance on the automobile." The County provided no concrete measures to reduce
this impact.
6
88.
7 2003 GP Policy LU 10.1, repeated as 2015 GP Policy LU 11.1, provides that the

8 County should provide sufficient commercial and industrial development opportunities to
"increase local employment levels and thereby minimize long-distance commuting." Again, the

10 County failed to comply with this Policy by approving a development that is residential-heavy,

11 and exacerbates the jobs/housing imbalance. The County merely asserted that employment lags

12 residential development by two or three decades, but there was no substantial evidence in the

13 record that its actions in approving yet more residential development would reduce the present

14 imbalance at any time, as Petitioner GSEJA pointed out.

89.
15 The Project/Alternative 7 was inconsistent with 7 2003 GP Policy LU 16.2 (2015

16 GP Policy LU 20.2) discouraging inappropriate land divisions in immediate proximity to

17 industrial agriculture. All MM Land Use 1 required was a 300-foot setback which is not

18 sufficient, and the DEIR did not provide substantial evidence it would be sufficient. The County

19 claimed that land use conflicts would be mitigated through the "Right to Farm" Ordinance which

20 precluded nuisance lawsuits by residential neighbors. However, this would not eliminate

21 conflicts, it would just prevent residents from suing over them. The land divisions would

22 inevitably lead to further residential development with further environmental impacts.

90. The Project and Alternative 7 were further inconsistent with 2003 GP Policies LU
23

24 17.3 and 2.1(e) (2015 Policies LU 21.3 and LU 2.1(e)), both of which prohibited adversely

25 impacting open space and the rural character of the surrounding area. This is precisely what the
Project/Alternative 7 allowed.
26

27 26 As the Endangered Habitats League noted, the 2003 General Plan Update showed a large
28 surplus capacity in housing, pre-recession, so there was no basis for concluding this Project or Alternative 7 was even necessary,
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 30

L

2 91. GP Policy LU 4.1(f) required that the County "Incorporate water conservation

3 techniques, such as groundwater recharge basins, use of porous pavement, drought tolerant

4 landscaping and water recycling as appropriate." Petitioner pointed out that the DEIR promised
there would be "water recycling" but that the County concluded this would be done only "if

6 available," which meant that it would occur only "where recycled water facilities are subject to

7 professional management," which was not required under the EIR or the Specific Plan.

8 Therefore, recycled water would not be used for front and back yards. Given California's

9 apparent return to drought conditions as this massive water-draining development moves

10 forward, the County should have required water recycling.

92.
11 2003 GP Policies AQ 1.1 through 17.11 required land use planning consistent

12 with standards for clean air; the Project and Alternative 7 were not, and were explicitly contrary

13 to the AQMP.

93.
14 The Project/Alternative 7 was further specifically inconsistent with GP Policy AQ

15 1.3 (both GPs), which provided:

16 Participate in the development and update of those regional air quality

17 management plans required under federal and state law, and meet all standards established for clean air in these plans.

18

19 The County asserted that "the project does not have control over the County's participation in

20 regional air quality management plans," but this wholly sidestepped the County's obligation to
not only participate in but to comply with those plans, and the County was exacerbating its
21 noncompliance with the Air Quality Management Plan by approving Alternative 7.27 Policy AQ

22

23 1.4 was similarly mandatory; though the County tried to contend 1.3 and 1.4 were "municipal
measures," the County had to enforce them when it was enacting policy.

24 94. GP Policy AQ 4.7 requires that projects mitigate their air quality impacts "to the
25 greatest extent feasible," which the Project/Alternative 7 did

26 included, for example, more EV charging stations. not do because they could have

27

28 27 The County conceded this point but attempted to point to a few GHG reduction measures it had identified as "consistent with" AQMP control measures. This was not the same thing as being consistent with the AQMP, which the Project is not.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 31

95.
2 2015 GP Policy AQ 20.9 requires that land use decisions "reduce urban sprawl,"
which was the opposite of what this development accomplished.

96.
4 Energy Impacts and Mitigation. The DEIR only briefly discussed CEQA

5 Guidelines Appendix F, and it primarily relied it upon compliance with building codes contrary to

6 established case law. The DEIR failed to address transportation energy impacts only mentioned

7 briefly and incorrectly in the FEIR. Finally, the DEIR did not address the viability of adding

8 renewable energy systems to the Project/Alternative 7; the provision for offsets was not the same
thing, as Appendix F clarifies.

97.
10 The FEIR further provided assumptions regarding transportation energy impacts

11 that simply were not credible. It stated that MM GHG 6 regarding placing EV charging stations

12 under the Project would lead to a net reduction of 1,958,998 gallons of gasoline consumed.

13 FEIR at 2-544. Based on the assumption that each car in the Project travelled 20.6 miles per day

14 on average, each car would need a 5 kWh charge, and this would take roughly one hour per car

15 for a Level 2 charger. Assuming there were 438 chargers onsite, and that each charger charged

16 10 cars per day every day (a wildly optimistic assumption, although it appears this is the

17 assumption the County's consultants made), the Project would displace 230,000 gallons of

18 gasoline per year, not 1,958,998.28 The calculations 7 for Alternative 7 were similarly flawed to

19 the extent that they exist.

98.
20 Hazards. The DEIR should have been recirculated to reflect that residents in PA-

21 10 and PA-12 could be inundated by the failure of the Hemet Dam; this was significant new

22 information. The County claimed, "The new text provides clarifying information supporting the

23 conclusion that potential project impacts from failure of the Hemet Dam are less than

24 significant." To the contrary, the disclosure was significant new information that 315 people

25 could potentially be killed because of constructing these Planning Areas.

99.
26 The DEIR's conclusion that the Project's contribution to wildfire risk was less

27 28 This calculation assumes that a gallon of gas is the equivalent of 33.3 kWh. At least one
28 commenter took issue with the propriety of the County's calculations regarding EV charger use, even though the County's calculations came with its FEIR and not the DEIR.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 32

1

2 than significant based on the use of fire-retardant roofs was also not based on substantial

3 evidence, given that the rest of the building materials would not be fire-resistant. The DEIR

4 conceded the Project was in a Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone.

100. Traffic. Recirculation. The FEIR revised the number of significant impacts on
traffic upwards, and this required recirculation.
6
101.
7 Inadequate Assessment and Disclosure of Impacts. The DEIR traffic counts were

8 from 2012 and 2013, and this was way too old for an EIR issued in roughly September 2016: the

9 counts should have been 1 at most 1 year old. Petitioner GSEJA's traffic consultant provided

10 counts from 2017 with its comments, and they were substantially higher. The County responded

11 first that there were no major development projects in the area, but their traffic study went far

12 beyond the immediate area of the Project, and the actual observation showed significant traffic

13 growth. The County further facetiously asserted that Petitioner's consultant's counts were from

14 when the I-215 was under construction but this obviously was not the case. The County

15 improperly disregarded direct evidence of higher traffic counts provided by Petitioner's

I consultant.29
16
102.
17 Further, the County did not convert trucks into passenger car equivalents

18 ("PCEs"), and while it said it had done so for freeway and intersection analysis, it turns out it did

19 SO using a default factor for trucks of 2%, even though Harley Knox and the Ramona

20 Expressway are heavily traveled by trucks - for example, on Harley Knox the correct percentage

21 was about 10-14% and for the Ramona Expressway it was 5%. The default value of 2% is low
for Riverside County in general.
22
103.
23 And directly related to the Project's air quality and GHG analysis, the traffic

24 study's internal trip capture methodology doubly counted internal capture on single family

25 residences. First, the County used regression equations (which are rarely used) to determine trip

29
26 Another commenter's consultant noted that the traffic counts were performed in some cases during the week before Easter, which would make them unreliably low. The County
27 responded that it did not have to avoid that week because the consultant had cited to Los Angeles Department of Transportation policy. This entirely missed the point: traffic counts
28 performed during Easter week would inherently be lower than usual and should not have been relied upon.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 33

2 making, which lowered the number of trips from 9.52 to 7.61 per dwelling unit. Second, the

3 County then applied a further reduction for internal trip capture. Petitioner GSEJA's consultant

4 questioned the County's internal trip capture methodology.

104.
5 The DEIR failed because the County a did not do a phased study, as it had to do
under Riverside County TIA Guidelines.
6
105.
7 The DEIR was inconsistent as to, and understated, the number of significant

8 unavoidable impacts, asserting there were 20 cumulative significant unavoidable impacts to
segments, though there were 24 identified in the TIA, and asserting there were 21 such impacts
9

10 regarding intersections but the TIA stated there were 28. This required recirculation.

106.
11 Finally, with neither the DEIR nor the FEIR did the County provide Project (or

12 Alternative 7) related traffic alone, which is routinely done so reviewers can double-check

13 whether all the trips were assigned to the roadways. No project-only exhibits were provided.

14 The DEIR and FEIR therefore failed as an informational document, and the DEIR should be
recirculated with such an exhibit.
15
107. Inadequate Assessment of Impacts of Mitigation Measures. Further, the
16

17 DEIR/FEIR did not assess the impacts of mitigation measures, which CEQA specifically

18 requires. See Guidelines § 15126.4(a)(1)(D). Specifically, the DEIR committed to widening of
or did not come to
19 the Ramona Expressway if the Mid County Parkway did not come to pass

20 pass quickly enough. The DEIR and FEIR did not evaluate this impact. Nor did it even

21 delineate how the Mid County Parkway would impact Project traffic or what its alignment would
be, and whether this would impact any of the TIA's analysis.
22
108.
23 Inadequate Mitigation. Finally, the DEIR and FEIR both acknowledged

24 significant offsite unavoidable impacts to traffic. Petitioner's consultant raised whether the

25 County was providing any mitigation besides road fees, and the County could not point to any.

26 Road fees may not be set up to accommodate mitigation, and therefore the County did not do all

27 that it could to eliminate significant impacts, in violation of CEQA.

109.
28 Water Resources, Hydrology, and Water Quality. Water Quality. The FEIR

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 34

1

2 baselessly concluded that best management practices ("BMPs") would reduce water quality

3 impacts to a less-than-significant level. The BMPs were non-mandatory and not a condition of

4 Project/Alternative 7 approval. Further, mitigation measure MM Hydro 1's promise to reduce
impacts to less than significant was not a permissible "performance standard" under CEQA.

110. As Petitioner pointed out, the conclusion that "regulatory compliance" would

7 eliminate any significant impacts to water quality was flawed because existing regulatory

8 standards have still led to impaired waterbodies at, for example, Lake Elsinore and Canyon Lake.

9 The County simply claimed that the "Maximum Extent Practicable" standard was enough despite
this evidence.
10

11 111. The County further baldly asserted that the Project would supposedly result in

12 beneficial water quality impacts because it would limit the amount of agricultural runoff. This

13 disregarded that downstream waterbodies are impaired from pollutants that relate to urban uses

14 which would be exacerbated by the Project/Alternative 7 runoff. For example, Canyon Lake is

15 impaired by pathogens, which are related to urban runoff.

112.
16 Further, the DEIR and FEIR concede that heavy rain related high flow period

17 diversions would not be filtered in any way.30
113.
18 Responses to comments indicated that the FEIR's Water Quality Modeling Report

19 assumed that EPA is phasing out chlorpyrifos and diazinon, but there is no evidence this is the

20 case, commenters showed that the pesticides were available on the internet, and there was no
substantial evidence to
21 support a conclusion that the pesticides would not be used onsite. The

22 assumption that voluntary efforts to reduce pesticide use based on an unknown quantity of

23 distribution of "outreach materials" of unknown efficacy would reduce impacts to less than

24 significant was not based on substantial evidence. In response to this comment, the County did

25 nothing to reduce impacts, but instead provided a string cite of inapposite cases from other

26 30 The County claimed that such high flow diversions were the responsibility of the County's
27 MS4 Permit, even though the Project will not discharge into an MS4, and there is simply no indication that the Permit does anything to improve water quality. The County's claim about
28 "meeting NPDES regulations at the time of subdivision development" was not sufficient to satisfy its burdens under CEQA.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 35

2 contexts which it claimed showed that compliance with existing regulations was all that CEQA

3 required. The DEIR's own evidence made clear that all BMPs for pesticide use had "unknown"

4 or "low" removal efficacy.

114.
5 The County failed to assess impacts from the Project on the planned RiverPark

6 Mitigation Bank. The County asserted that this was permissible because the Mitigation Bank

7 had not been approved as of the time of the issuance of the FEIR, but it was contemplated and

8 water quality issues attributable to the Project could well affect it. Therefore, analysis would
hardly be "speculative."

115.
10 In the FEIR, the County revised plans for the Water Quality Basin to include a

11 new West Water Quality Basin and an East Water Quality Basin, which would between them

12 virtually surround the Lakeview Burn Dump, a toxic area. The County did not address the risks
from this proximity. Indeed, the County planned for the construction of a road and channel
13

14 through the Burn Dump site, asserting that the public and other species would supposedly be

15 protected by a 2013 "Site Specific Health and Safety Plan" prepared for the Dump site. This

16 conclusion was not based on substantial evidence and any analysis that supported it should have

17 been included in the DEIR and not in an Appendix. Further, the County claimed that there

18 would be no significant impacts from the Burn Dump based on a mitigation measure, MM

19 Hazards-Mat 4, which did not require compliance with the cited Plan. Finally, the creation of a

20 situation where the two Water Quality Basins surrounded the unremediated Burn Dump was

21 significant new information requiring recirculation of the DEIR.

116.
22 The Center for Biological Diversity commented that there is a portion of the

23 Project/Alternative 7 that will be downstream of the proposed Water Quality Basins; the FEIR

24 appears to concede this remained true. The County's only response was that those discharges

25 would be subject to WQMP requirements, though it is entirely unclear how these requirements

26 would be met, such that there was no substantial evidence for the County's conclusion.

117.
27 Hydrology. The FEIR adjusted the estimate of flows to the San Jacinto River

28 from 480 afy to 178; however, this still reflected a greater than ten percent increase which could

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 36

1

2 be significant, but which was not evaluated, despite calls for evaluation by the Wildlife

3 Agencies. The numbers were incorrect in Tables 5.8-H and 5.8-I, and the County failed to
explain why.
4
118.
5 Water Resources. The DEIR did not address the Project/Alternative 7's impacts

6 on water resources because it did not address impacts to species from further drawing down

7 groundwater supplies in the region.

119.
8 And the Water Supply Assessment (*WSA") for the Project projected an increase

9 in water resources from the Metropolitan Water District, but this was not in line with the State's

10 continuing drought conditions.

120.
11 Other CEQA Issues. Inadequate Project Description. The project description

12 was inadequate because it did not sufficiently describe the commercial and commercial office

13 uses, didn't adequately address the expansion of the Ramona Expressway, and did not

14 adequately describe Development Agreement 73's components. It is not clear the Development

15 Agreement was made available with the DEIR. Discussion of Alternative 7 was even more

16 truncated and did not comply with CEQA considering its likely and ultimate adoption.

121.
17 Cumulative Impacts. The cumulative impacts analysis relied on the "summary of

18 projections" method but the 2015 General Plan Update and GPA 960 EIRs only analyzed "mid-

19 range" projections in violation of Guidelines section 15378(a). In response to this comment, the

20 County asserted that commenters should have challenged the 2015 General Plan Update, but this

21 was false. The commenters had every right to raise that the "summary of projections" method

22 was inadequate when it relied on an inadequate planning document.

122.
23 The Sierra Club and the San Bernardino Valley Audubon Society commented that

24 the update to the Riverside County Housing Element ("HE") for the Lakeview/Nuevo Area Plan

25 was a reasonably foreseeable project and should have been addressed as a cumulative project in

26 the DEIR; it projected an additional 11,317 units over approximately 1028 acres. The County
refused to do so because the HE amendment was not under consideration at the time of the 2006
27

28 NOP, but as detailed above, the DEIR was for a different Project, and the DEIR could not have

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 37

-

2 been legally recirculated anyway. An up-to-date analysis of impacts, including impacts to

3 agricultural resources, was required.31, 32

123.
4 Alternatives Analysis. The DEIR contained an inadequate alternatives analysis

5 both in terms of the range of alternatives analyzed and in terms of the quality of the analysis

6 it where it did occur. As to the lack of a reasonable range of alternatives, the DEIR failed to

7 include analysis of an alternative of higher density development in existing areas, even though

8 this would have appreciably reduced GHG emissions and other impacts.33 And the six other

9 alternatives besides the "No Build" Alternative all included only minimal changes to the Project

10 and did little to reduce significant impacts, particularly regarding air quality. Finally, the County

11 defined one of the Project objectives as the use of the site, making an analysis of alternative sites

12 impossible, in violation of CEQA.

124.
13 The quality of the County's analysis of alternatives was below par for several

14 reasons. For example, as to Alternative 1, the County falsely concluded that the Project would

15 be more beneficial than the alternative because agricultural use would continue in areas

16 "conserved" by the Project. As the Center for Biological Diversity noted, it defied common

17 sense to conclude that "allowing the Project to remain in its present state would cause more

18 impacts to imperiled plants and animals than paving over and developing large portions of the

site."
19

20 125. As to Alternative 3, the County could have addressed conserving land for

21 biological purposes north of the Ramona Expressway as many commenters urged. Instead, in the

22 FEIR, the County justified its conclusion that biological impacts would be greater than under the

23

24 31 The County also it contended that it found the Project's impacts to agricultural resources to be significant and unavoidable, so consideration of the HE EIR was not relevant or necessary.

25 This missed the point that CEQA requires an analysis of the extent of impacts, not simply a

32 declaration that they are significant and unavoidable.

26 The cumulative impacts discussion was also flawed for the reasons discussed as to the

33 specific substantive areas discussed previously in this Petition.

27 The County contended that development in higher density areas was not a feasible alternative

28 essentially because it would not necessarily involve the present developer. is There is no basis for requiring this in the analysis of an alternative.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 38

2 Project because of agricultural runoff. This conclusion had no substantial evidence basis as the

3 land is currently undeveloped.34 Moreover, the County had to identify alternatives that avoided

4 or reduced significant impacts, and this alternative failed to do that, so the County presented no
reasonable range of alternatives.
5
126.
6 Alternative 4 proposed development in the Lakeview Mountains, but approval
for such a development is not likely forthcoming under the HANS and JPR processes of the
MSHCP. There was simply no basis for selecting this as an alternative, other than to generate a
parade of horribles to make the Project look good. The Alternative did not comply with the

10 requirement that alternatives lessen project impacts.

127.
11 Alternative 6, the "Low Carbon Alternative," proposed to put green roofs on at

12 least 50% of the roof areas and provide homeowners with electric lawnmowers. The DEIR

13 failed to quantify the GHG savings from the alternative, and it analyzed no solar power

14 generation on site as part of it, although this would have been entirely viable. The County

15 responded that the alternative would not reduce GHG emissions as much as the Project, and that

16 the Project would require installation of PV systems on single family roofs. The first assertion if

17 true was a reason for not evaluating Alternative 6 as an alternative. The second assertion was

18 simply false.

128.
19 Growth inducement. The County disregarded the Court's prior Order requiring a

20 more detailed analysis of growth-inducing impacts because it again asserted that such analysis

21 would be "speculative," though the Court specifically rejected this conclusion before. The

22 analysis was plainly inadequate under existing law because (a) the Project/Alternative 7 were

23 extremely large and sited in an area with little existing development, and they included

24 significant infrastructure, (b) the infrastructure will result in direct growth reducing impacts, and

25 (c) the County had the ability to forecast potential future growth based on its admitted possession
of information related to potential future projects.
26

27 34 The County further presumed that the mere preservation of 29 acres north of the Ramona
28 Expressway under the Project would avoid the impacts to biological resources, without a substantial evidence basis.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 39

T
129. The DEIR failed to analyze growth inducement from off-site water and sewer
2

3 lines to the Project/Alternative 7 which the County conceded would lead to developing at least

4 31,091 Equivalent Dwelling Units ("EDU") and approximately 91,704 residents, asserting that
the impacts had been analyzed in the EMWD's Lakeview/Nuevo Area Wide Master Plan. This
5 assertion disregarded CEQA's requirement that the DEIR for a project analyze the whole of an
6 action, including growth inducing impacts. And it contradicted the DEIR's statements that the it
7 Project was key in requiring those improvements to be developed.
8
130. The DEIR also attempted to place responsibility for growth inducement on the
Mid-County Parkway project to expand the Ramona Expressway, but the Mid County Parkway 10

11 FEIR/S claimed that "the potential growth-related effects for the MCP project are limited and
less than significant under CEQA." In other words, each EIR blamed the other for growth and
12
neither properly analyzed it.
13
131. The DEIR further claimed that growth was projected in the area anyway. This did
14

15 not excuse the County from analyzing the inducement this Project would bring. Only County

16 approvals will lead to growth in the unincorporated County areas.
RIVERSIDE COUNTY ORDINANCES
17
132. Ordinance 348. Approval of Alternative 7 violates Ordinance 348 because there
18

19 are no "new conditions" justifying an amendment to the General Plan. The County cited
ownership of 2,883 acres by one entity as the new condition, but Lewis Homes has consistently 20 owned the land at issue since before 2010 when the original DEIR was adopted by the County,
21 and the County approved a new General Plan in 2015 and could have addressed Alternative 7 22

23 and the proposed Project then rather than doing it mid-cycle.

133. demonstrate that a foundational element of the General Plan The County failed to
24 had to be amended. This was one of the bases of the Court's Order previously, and the County
25 did nothing to address the Court's concerns. The County did not make the required 26

27 "Extraordinary Amendments" findings for amending the General Plan, because it had to find
substantial evidence that new circumstances disclosed during the review process justify
28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 40

1

2 modifying the General Plan, and there were no circumstances subsequent to the Court's opinion
that were new - much less any subsequent to the 2015 General Plan, where the
Project/Alternative 7 could have been addressed. Additionally, the County demonstrated no

5 urgency regarding General Plan Amendment 720 to justify not waiting until the next General
Plan Update.
6
134.
7 Planning Staff also used approval of the Mid County Parkway as a new condition,

8 but the Mid County Parkway FEIS/R contended that the Mid County Parkway ("MCP") would
not contribute to
9 any new or unplanned growth. Therefore, the DEIR for this Project should not

10 have been relying on the presence of the MCP.

135.
11 The County asserted that the Foundation Component amendment would not

12 contradict and would facilitate the General Plan Vision, but this conclusion was not based on

substantial evidence.
13
136.
14 Ordinance 663.10. The County did not comply with its own Ordinance 663.10

15 because it provided solely for the payment of mitigation fees regarding the Project/Alternative 7

16 although it conceded that at least 10 SKR were detected on the site - without the developer even

17 specifically looking for them. Riverside County Ordinance 663.10 states that "Each proposed

18 development project shall be reviewed to determine the most appropriate course of action to

19 ensure the survival of the species through one or more of the following," and it then specifies on-

20 site mitigation or the payment of fees. The Ordinance further specifies that a project may be

21 referred to federal and state agencies for review, and that "The successful completion and

22 implementation of a Habitat Conservation Plan for the [SKR] would be jeopardized by not

23 implementing a procedure that requires review of each proposed development within the Fee

24 Assessment Area to determine the best means of mitigating impacts to the [SKR]." Clearly, the

25 Ordinance required the County to evaluate on-site mitigation here; it refused to do so.

137.
26 Other. The County did not follow its own procedures in making a full Fiscal

27 Impact Analysis available to the public, or in posting a proper notice regarding its consideration
of the Project/Alternative 7.

2 RIVERSIDE COUNTY GENERAL PLAN INCONSISTENCY

138.
3 7 The Project/Alternative 7 were inconsistent with the GP for the reasons stated in

4 the Land Use analysis under CEQA. And the amendment to the County GP to allow level of

5 service exceedances that previously violated 2003 GP Policy C 2.1 resulted in internal

6 inconsistency of the GP with 2003 GP Policy LU 22.3 and 2015 GP Policy LU 28.3.

7 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

8 Recirculation of the DEIR

9 [CEQA, Pub. Res. Code §§ 21000 et seq.]

139.
10 140. Petitioners reincorporate and reallege paragraphs 1-138 as if set forth in full.

11 A DEIR must be recirculated if there is the addition of significant new

12 information after public notice is given or if the DEIR is so fundamentally and basically

13 inadequate that meaningful public review and comment were precluded. Here the DEIR was

14 fundamentally and basically inadequate in that, among other things, it:

15 relied on biological surveys that were over ten years old, and failed to disclose even the

16 most rudimentary information regarding how those surveys were conducted,

17 ignored the precautionary principle and instead speculated as to reasons why there might

18 not be a significant impact, in violation of CEQA's requirement of a good faith, reasoned

19 analysis,

20 failed to establish a baseline for several rare and threatened species,

21 failed to comply with this Court's order regarding air quality impacts to sensitive

22 receptors and the general population,

23 failed to conduct a good faith analysis of GHG impacts,

24 failed to provide analysis regarding GHG impacts considering SB 32 and Executive

25 Order B-30-15 until the FEIR, and even then, only analyzed the Project and not

26 Alternative 7, the development the County ultimately approved,

27 completely revised the Project and Alternative 7's proposed hydrology, resulting in a

28 development which would surround a toxic waste dump with the Project/Alternative 7's

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 42

- N m two Water Quality Basins,
failed to acknowledge all significant impacts to traffic (and air quality and GHGs) by
using the MXD model which was only intended for urban developments of 5000 units or D w less.

These comments were raised by Petitioners and others before the agency acted upon the Project.
6 141. Recirculation is also required where the drafters of the EIR are confronted with
7 significant new information after public notice is given on the DEIR. This occurred, inter alia,
8 in not recognizing in a recirculated document:
9 the risks the Project/Alternative 7 posed because of the Water Quality Basins surrounding
10 the Lakeview Burn Dump, and
11 the multiple other revisions to the Project included in the FEIR.
12 142. Recirculation of an EIR requires notice under Guidelines section 15087 and
13 consultation under Guidelines section 15086. Notice under section 15087 means the agency
14 must provide for a new a review period and include a list of significant effects anticipated from the
15 project. Consultation means that the agency must request comment from responsible agencies
16 and trustee agencies and any other state, federal or local agencies with jurisdiction over any
17 resource which may be impacted by the Project.
18
143. This, the County failed to do. Significant information was omitted from the DEIR
19 on the issues identified above.

17 150. Petitioners reincorporate and reallege paragraphs through 148 as if fully set
18
forth.
19 151. CEQA requires an agency to adopt feasible mitigation measures that will
20 substantially lessen or avoid the project's potentially significant impacts and to describe those
21 mitigation measures in the DEIR. Pub. Res. Code § § 21002, 21081(a), 21100(b)(3); Guidelines
22 § 15126.4. A lead agency may not conclude that an impact is significant and unavoidable
23 without requiring the imposition of all feasible mitigation measures to reduce impacts to less
24 than significant levels. Guidelines §§ 15126.4, 15091.
25 152. The DEIR failed to adequately mitigate for impacts to multiple biological
26 resources, impacts as to which it should have found significant. The County failed to adopt
27 feasible measures identified by members of the public including Petitioner GSEJA and Petitioner

8 CEQA requires that an agency must adopt a "statement of overriding

10 insignificance by mitigation measures or the adoption of alternatives. The agency must find

11 "that specific overriding economic, legal, social, technological, or other benefits of the project

12 outweigh the significant effects on the environment." Pub. Res. Code § 21081(b).

155.
13 The statement of overriding considerations must be based on substantial evidence

14 in the record. Pub. Res. Code $ 21081.5; Guidelines § 15093(b).

21 158.
22 CEQA requires a finite and stable Project Description in an EIR.

159.
23 The DEIR failed to adequately describe the Project or Alternative 7, in that it did

24 not sufficiently describe the commercial and commercial office uses, didn't adequately address

25 the expansion of the Ramona Expressway, and did not adequately describe Development

26 Agreement 73's components. It is not clear the Development Agreement was made available

27 with the DEIR. Discussion of Alternative 7 was even more truncated and did not comply with

28 CEQA considering its likely and ultimate adoption.

forth. Petitioners reincorporate and reallege paragraphs 1 through 159 as if fully set

6 161.
7 Riverside County Ordinance 348, section 2.5(B) provides that:

8 Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.6 and Section 2.7, no Foundation

9 Component Amendment shall be heard or approved except as part of the Eight- Year General Plan Review Cycle.
162.
10 Riverside County Ordinance 348, section 2.6 provides that a Foundation

11 Component Amendment - Extraordinary may only be made if the County finds both that

12 The foundation change is based on substantial evidence that new conditions or

13 circumstances disclosed during the review process justify modifying the General Plan, that the modifications do not conflict with the overall Riverside County

14 Vision, and that they would not create an internal inconsistency among elements of the General Plan,

15 Riverside County Ordinance No. 348, section 2.6(F)(1), and that

16 A condition exists or an event has occurred that is unusually compelling and can only be rectified by making changes in the current Riverside County Vision,

17 General Planning Principles set forth in General Plan Appendix B, or Foundation Component,

18 Riverside County Ordinance No. 348, section 2.6(F)(2), as well as finding that additional
19 conditions exist justifying the Foundation Component Amendment.

20 163. The County here failed in its mandatory duty to make either of the required

21 findings. There were no "new conditions disclosed during the review process" that justified a

22 General Plan Amendment, and the modifications conflicted with the Riverside County Vision,

23 and the Amendments created internal inconsistencies within the General Plan.

24 164. Further, there were no "unusually compelling" circumstances.

25 165. Finally, there were no further conditions as required by Riverside County

26 Ordinance No. 348 section 2.6(F) subsections (3)-(8).
