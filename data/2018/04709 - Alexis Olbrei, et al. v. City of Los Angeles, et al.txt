I. INTRODUCTION

2 1. On June 14, 2018, Respondents City of Los Angeles and the City Council of the

3 City of Los Angeles (Respondents), acting through the Planning Commission for the City of

4 Los Angeles, approved a mixed-use live/work development project comprising 475 live/work

5 dwelling units and up to 125,000 square feet of commercial and office floor area at 520 Mateo

6 Street (Project). Respondents also certified an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the

7 Project and adopted Findings for the EIR, a Statement of Overriding Considerations, and a
8 Mitigation Monitoring Program. Respondents bifurcated consideration of the Project into two

9 cases that were separately agendized, but jointly considered, at the Planning Commission
10 | hearing on June 14, 2018. Respondents considered and denied an appeal of Case No. VTT-

11 74529-1A, which concerns the approval of a Vesting Tentative Tract for the merger and re-
12 subdivision for condominium purposes of a 2.23-acre site into one Master Lot and 14 airspace
13 lots for the development of the Project (VTT Approval). Respondents also separately
14 agendized and approved additional approvals for the Project on the same day, June 14, 2018

15 under Case No. CPC-2016-3853-GPA-VZC-HD-ZAD-SPR (General Plan Amendment

16 Approval).

17 2. Pursuant to the General Plan Amendment Approval, Respondents, acting
18 through the Planning Commission, (1) found that no subsequent EIR or addendum is required
19 for approval of the Project, (2) approved and recommended that the Mayor and City Council
20 approve a General Plan Amendment to the Central City North Community Plan to change the
21 Land Use Designation of the project site from Heavy Manufacturing to Regional Center
22 Commercial land use, (3) approved and recommended that the City Council adopt a Vesting
23 Zone Change and Height District Change, (4) approved the Zoning Administrator's
24 Determination to reduce parking for Joint Living and Work Quarters, and (5) approved a Site
25 Plan a Review for a development project creating 50 or more guest rooms and/or 50,000 gross
26 square feet of non-residential floor area. The VTT Approval and the General Plan Amendment
27 Approval were separately memorialized in two separate letters of determination which were

28 issued on July 18, 2018. On July 18, 2018, a Notice of Determination was filed with the

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
2

1 County Clerk of the County of Los Angeles for Respondents' certification of the EIR. The

2 filing of a Notice of Determination begins a 30-day statute of limitations pursuant to Public

3 Resources Code section 21167, subd. (c). Thus, Petitioners filed a Petitioner for Writ of

4 Mandamus on August 16, 2018.

5 3. Petitioners also timely appealed the decisions of Respondents acting through the

6 Planning Commission. However, on August 1, 2018, Respondents rejected as untimely

7 Southwest Carpenters' appeal of the VTT Approval. The Petition for Writ of Mandamus

8 initially included a cause of action for failure of the Respondents to afford Petitioners due

• process. While Respondents had initially refused accept Petitioners' appeal as timely,

10 Respondent City Council ultimately considered Petitioners' appeal on the merits at each of its

11 hearings on the Project, thereby waiving any objection it had to the timeliness of this appeal.
12 Thus, Petitioners were successful in vindicating their due process rights through this action.

13 4. On October 16, 2018, Respondents' Planning and Land Use Management

14 Committee voted to recommend denial of Petitioners' appeals. On October 31, 2018,

15 Respondent City Council of the City of Los Angeles approved the Project, including (1)
16 certification of the Project EIR, (2) adoption of the findings of the Planning and Land Use

17 Committee, (3) adoption of a resolution for a General Plan Amendment, (4) adoption of an

18 ordinance effectuating a Vesting Zone Change and Height District Change for the Project, and

19 (5) denial of Petitioners' appeals. On November 2, 2018, Respondent City Council of the City

20 of Los Angeles filed a Notice of Determination pursuant to Public Resources Code section

21 21152.

22 5. Petitioners Alexis Olbrei, Dan Macdonald, and the Southwest Regional, Council

23 of Carpenters (collectively referred to herein as "Petitioners") challenge the approval of the

24 Project on the grounds that the Project does not comply with the California Environmental
25 Quality Act (CEQA--Pub. Resources Code § 21000 et seq.) because, inter alia, the EIR fails

26 to provide an adequate alternatives analysis, the EIR's discussion of greenhouse gases,

27 hazardous materials, and cumulative impacts is inadequate, and the EIR fails to disclose the

28 proper baseline for hazardous materials. Respondents' certification of the EIR and approval of

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
3

1 the Project constitutes an abuse of discretion and must be reversed.

2 II. PARTIES

3 6. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 5 as if fully set

4 forth herein.

5 7. Alexis Olbrei is a taxpayer and resident of the City of Los Angeles, where the

6 Project is located.

7 8. Dan Macdonald is a taxpayer and resident of the City of Los Angeles, where the

8 Project is located.

9 9. Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters is a labor union representing 50,000
10 union carpenters in six states, including in southern California, and has a strong interest in

11 addressing the environmental impacts of development projects, such as the Project. Members
12 of Petitioner Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters reside in the City and in the County of

13 Los Angeles, and include residents affected by the Project, whose interests will be adversely

14 affected by the violations of CEQA and approval of the Project. Southwest Regional Council
15 of Carpenters submitted comments on the Project that addressed the inadequaciès of

16 Respondents' environmental review.

17 10. Respondent City of Los Angeles, acting through Respondent City Planning
18 Commission and the Planning and Land Use Management Committee of the City of Los

19 Angeles, is a charter city. On July 18, 2018, Respondent City of Los Angeles issued two

20 separate Letters of Determination memorializing their actions at the June 14, 2018 City
21 Planning Commission meeting where Respondent approved the multiple approvals required for
22 the Project and certified the EIR for the Project. On October 16, 2018, Respondent City of Los

23 Angeles, acting through the Planning and Land Use Management Committee, recommended

24 denial of Petitioners' appeal and approval of the Project to Respondent City Council.
25 11. Respondent City Council of the City of Los Angeles is the governing body of
26 Respondent City of Los Angeles with responsibility for complying with and enforcing all

27 applicable laws. On October 31, 2018, Respondent City Council of the City of Los Angeles

28 voted to approve the Project. On November 2, 2018, Respondent City of Los Angeles filed a

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
4

1 Notice of Determination, which began another 30-day statute of limitations pursuant to Public•

2 Resources Code section 21167, subd. (c). Upon the filing of the Petition, Respondent City

3 Council of the City of Los Angeles had not yet considered the Project, and Petitioners hereby

4 designate Respondent City Council of the City of Los Angeles in the Petition by the fictitious

5 name of Doe 1.

6 12. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, or otherwise, of

7 Does 2 through 15, are unknown to Petitioners who therefore sue said Respondents by such

8 fictitious names and will seek leave to amend this Petition for Writ of Mandamus when their
9 identities have been ascertained.

10 13. Petitioners are informed and believe that at all times herein alleged,

11 Respondents and each of them were the agents and employees of each of the remaining

12 Respondents and while doing the things herein alleged, were acting within the course and

13 scope of such agency and employment.

14 14. Real Party in Interest CP V 520 Mateo, LLC is a Delaware Limited Liability

15 Company. Respondents' Notice of Determination identified CP V 520 Mateo, LLC as the

16 Project applicant and Real Party in Interest. On information and belief, CP V 520 Mateo, LLC

17 applied for and received approvals from Respondents for the Project.

18 15. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, or otherwise, of

19 Does 16 through 30, are unknown to Petitioners who therefore sue said Real Parties in Interest
20 by such fictitious names and will seek leave to amend this Petition for Writ of Mandamus

21 when their identities have been ascertained.

22 16. Petitioners are informed and believe that at all times herein alleged, Real Parties

23 in Interest and each of them were the agents and employees of each of the remaining Real

24 Parties in Interest and while doing the things herein alleged, were acting within the course and
25 scope of such agency and employment.

III. STANDING

2 17. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 16 as if fully
3 set forth herein.

4 18. Approval of the Project will adversely affect the interests of Petitioners Alexis

5 Olbrei and Dan Macdonald. Petitioners Alexis Olbrei and Dan Macdonald are individuals

6 dedicated to the protection of the environment in the City and in the County of Los Angeles by
7 participating in local environmental and land use policy and decision making. Petitioners

8 Alexis Olbrei and Dan Macdonald are residents in the City of Los Angeles and are affected by
9 the Project, and whose interests in preservation of the environmental integrity of the City will

10 be adversely affected by the lack of proper environmental review under CEQA and approval of
11 the Project. Petitioners are also members of Petitioner Southwest Regional Council of

12 Carpenters. Petitioner is an "aggrieved person" within the meaning of Public Resources Code

13 § 21177.

14 19. Approval of the Project will adversely affect the interests of Petitioner

15 Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters and its members. Said organization is a labor union

16 that is dedicated to also preserving the environment for its members, including those in the

17 County of Los Angeles. Approval of the Project and certification of the EIR will adversely

18 affect these interests of Petitioner Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters and its members.
19 Members or representatives of Petitioner Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters, on behalf
20 thereof, have submitted comments on and objections to the lack of CEQA compliance during
21 the administrative proceedings where the Project was considered. Accordingly, Petitioner
22 Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters is an "aggrieved person" within the meaning of

23 Public Resources Code § 21177. The claims asserted and relief requested are broad-based, so

24 that participation in the litigation by individual members is not required.

25 20. Jurisdiction of this court is invoked pursuant to California Code of Civil

26 Procedure Sections 1085 and 1094.5; California Public Resources Code Section 21167; CEQA

27 Guidelines Section 15112; the Constitution of the State of California; the Constitution of the

28 United States; and other applicable laws and regulations.

2 IV. EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

3 21. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 20 as if fully

4 set forth herein.

5 22. Petitioners have performed all conditions precedent to the filing of this Petition

6 by themselves or others, raising each and every issue known to them before Respondents, in

7 compliance with Public Resources Code § 21177, Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085 and

8 1094.5, and other applicable law.

9 23. Notice of the filing of this action as required by Public Resources Code §
10 21167.5 was mailed to Respondents on August 16, 2018. (Letter and Proof of Service are

11 attached hereto as Exhibit "A.")

12

13 V. FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

14 Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act [Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.]
15 24. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 23 as if fully
16 set forth herein.

17 25. Respondents' approval of the EIR constitutes an abuse of discretion because,
18 inter alia, the EIR fails to provide an adequate alternatives analysis, Respondents applied
19 improper greenhouse gas thresholds and the EIR's greenhouse gas analysis is inadequate, the
20 EIR provided a faulty cumulative impacts analysis, and Respondents erroneously failed to
21 disclose the proper baseline for hazardous materials.
22 26. CEQA requires alternatives to the project which "(1) offer substantial
23 environmental advantages over the project proposal (Pub. Resources Code, § 21001); and (2)
24 may be feasibly accomplished in a successful manner' considering the economic,
25 environmental, social and technological factors involved." (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board
26 of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 566.) "[T]he key to the selection of the range of
27 alternatives is to identify alternatives that meet most of the project's objectives but have a
28

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
7

1 reduced level of environmental impacts." (Watsonville Pilots Assn. v. City of Watsonville

2 (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1059, 1089.) The EIR fails to satisfy the first prong of the alternatives

3 requirement because the alternatives presented do not offer substantial environmental

4 advantages over the project proposal.

5 27. An EIR must "include a description of the physical environmental conditions in
6 the vicinity of the project, as they exist at the time the notice of preparation is published."
7 (CEQA Guidelines § 15125(a).) The City did not adequately evaluate, disclose, or describe

8 baseline environmental conditions in regard to a variety of resource categories, including air
quality, greenhouse gases, and hazards and hazardous materials.

10 28. Respondents improperly relied on thresholds of significance they have not

11 themselves adopted. California law requires Respondents to determine the Project's
12 contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. CEQA Guidelines allow an agency to determine the

13 significance of Project-level greenhouse gas impacts, for instance, by setting quantitative

14 emissions thresholds and by determining consistency with a Climate Action Plan, consisting of a
15 regulations "adopted by the relevant public agency through a public review process." (CEQA
16 Guidelines § 15064.4(b).) To be relied on as mitigation, this plan must actively "reduce or

17 mitigate the project's incremental contribution of greenhouse gas emissions." (CEQA

18 Guidelines § 15064.4(b).)

19 29. Respondents evaluate the consistency of the Project with, inter alia, the
20 California Air Resources Board's AB 32 Scoping Plan (Scoping Plan) to conclude Project-
21 level impacts under this significance threshold are less than significant prior to mitigation. The
22 Scoping Plan is a statewide a plan designed to reduce certain categories of greenhouse gases

23 consistent with the mandate of State greenhouse gas laws. However, Center for Biological
24 Diversity v. California Department of Fish and Wildlife (2015) 620 Cal.4th 204, a recent

25 landmark California Supreme Court decision, noted that the Scoping Plan was not designed or
26 intended to be used at the Project-level. This case held that, to rely on the Scoping Plan, an
27 agency, such as Respondents, must provide analysis that adequately explains why application
28 of the Scoping Plan at the Project-level would be suitable under the circumstances.

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
8

1 Respondents provided no such analysis and, thus, Respondents' reliance on the Scoping Plan is

2 erroneous. Respondents' reliance on this or any other plan not adopted by Respondents are

3 unlawful and erroneous. (CEQA Guidelines § 15064.4(b).) In addition, Respondents' use of

4 the Scoping Plan did not serve to reduce or mitigate the project's incremental contribution of

5 greenhouse gas emissions," as required by law. (CEQA Guidelines § 15064.4(b).)

6 Accordingly, Respondents' significance determination as measured against the Scoping Plan is

7 without merit.

8 30. Respondents failed to provide an adequate cumulative impacts analysis for,

9 inter alia, air quality and greenhouse gas emissions. CEQA requires Respondents to consider

10 direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts. Cumulative impacts include direct or indirect impacts

11 caused by the Project that may be less than significant at the Project-level but are significant
12 when considered in conjunction with to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future

13 development. (CEQA Guidelines § 15355.) Thus, this analysis failed to accurately represent

14 the cumulative impacts of the Project combined with other past, present, and reasonably

15 foreseeable future projects.

16 31. Respondents must prepare an adequate EIR that conforms with all of the

17 procedural and substantive requirements set forth under CEQA. Approval of the Project EIR,

18 which lacked both procedural and substantive requirements under CEQA, constitutes a failure

19 to proceed in a manner required by law.

20 VI. ATTORNEYS' FEES

21 32. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 31 as if fully
22 set forth herein.

23 33. In pursuing this action, Petitioners will confer a substantial benefit on the People

24 of the State of California and therefore are entitled to recover from Respondents and Real Party

25 in Interest reasonable attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure §

26 1021.5 , and other provisions of the law.

27

28

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
9

1 VII. INJUNCTION

2 34. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 33 as if fully

3 set forth herein.

35. An actual controversy has arisen concerning Respondents' failure to comply

5 with CEQA (Pub. Resources Code § 21000 et seq.), as set forth above.

6 36. As a result of the above-alleged violations of CEQA, Respondents have failed to

7 conduct adequate environmental review as required by law and, thus, have failed to proceed in

8 a manner required by law in approving the Project.

37. At all times mentioned herein, Respondents have been able to comply with

10 CEQA, prepare adequate environmental review, and comply with all relevant provisions of

11 law. Notwithstanding such ability, Respondents have failed and continue to fail to perform

12 their duty to comply with CEQA.

13 38: Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that Respondents
14 are threatening to proceed with development of the Project in the near future. Said

15 implementation of the Project will irreparably harm the environment and will result in

16 significant and unmitigated adverse environmental impacts.

17 39. Petitioners possess no speedy, adequate remedy at law, in that implementation
18 and development in connection with the Project will permanently and forever harm, injure,

19 degrade, and impact the environmental values of the City, the County of Los Angeles and the

20 State of California. Petitioners will suffer irreparable and permanent injuries if Respondents'

21 actions described herein are not set aside.

22 40. A stay and/or restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunction

23 should issue restraining Respondents from proceeding with development of the Project.

24 41. In order to preserve the status quo, stay and/or restraining order and

25 preliminary and permanent injunction should issue staying Respondents' approval of the

26 Project and certification of the EIR.

City of Los Angeles and the
City Planning Commission of the City of Los Angeles 200 North Spring Street Los Angeles, CA 90012

RE: Notice of Intent to Commence Litigation

Pursuant to the requirements of Public Resources Code Section 21167.5, this letter will
serve as notice that Alexis Olbrei, Dan Macdonald, and Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters will commence litigation against the City of Los Angeles and the City Planning Commission of the City of Los Angeles ("City").
The litigation challenges the actions of the City (1) to approve a Vesting Tentative Tract for the merger and re-subdivision for condominium purposes of a 2.23-acre site into one Master Lot and 14 airspace lots for the development of the 520 Mateo Project (*Project"), (2) to approve and recommend a General Plan Amendment to the Central City North Community Plan to change the Land Use Designation of the project site from Heavy Manufacturing to Regional Center Commercial land use, (3) to approve and recommend that the City Council adopt Vesting Zone Change and Height District Change, (4) to approve the Zoning Administrator's Determination to reduce parking for Joint Living and Work Quarters, (5) to approve a Site Plan Review for a development project creating 50 or more guest rooms and/or 50,000 gross square feet of non-residential floor area, and certified the EIR for the Project to allow development of a mixed-use live/work development compromising 475 live/work dwelling units and up to 125,000 square feet of commercial and office floor area. The City's Notice of Determination listed Real
Party in Interest CP V 520 Mateo, LLC ("Real Party in Interest") as the Project applicant.
The litigation has been commenced, inter alia, because the actions listed in the preceding paragraph do not comply with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.).
