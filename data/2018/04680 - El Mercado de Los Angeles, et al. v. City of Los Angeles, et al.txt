VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

'1 Petitioners El Mercado de Los Angeles and Pedro A. Rosado (sometimes
2 collectively "Petitioners") allege as follows:
3 INTRODUCTION
4 1. This action challenges the March 6, 2018 decisions and approvals by
5 Respondents City of Los Angeles and Los Angeles City Council (sometimes collectively
6 the "City") in connection with the City's approval of: (a) a mixed-use building at 126 N.
7 Lorena Street, known as the Lorena Plaza Mixed Use Project (the "Project" or "Lorena
8 Plaza") submitted by Real Party/applicant A Community of Friends ("ACOF"); and (b) a 9 Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND") for the Project.
10 2. The Project would place an approximately 90,000-square-foot, 4-5-story
11
PO9L-LOLL6 40O1 pc 'anueny oBuaey YyoN OdV 'wäl MVT THE SILVERSTEI mixed-use residential and commercial development on the site of historic heavy industrial
12 uses, including where dangerous solvents and other hazardous materials were used, and
8 13 which is also the location of an abandoned oil well. Pasadena, 14 3. The Project has drawn significant public opposition as well as scrutiny and
15 objections from the City Council itself. Prominent among those is the Project's significant, 5
16 unmitigated impacts related to toxic substances on the Project site, air quality and health
17 risk impacts both to the tens of thousands of persons who work in and/or patronize El 18 Mercado on a weekly basis, including thousands of children, and also to the proposed
19 future residents of the Project, all of whom may be exposed to significant health risks.
20 4. These inadequately studied contaminant health risks were noted as
21 significant concerns by the City. During the City Council's Planning and Land Use
22 Management ("PLUM") Committee meeting, Councilman Jose Huizar, who is Chair of the
23 PLUM Committee and whose district the Project is in, stated that Boyle Heights:
24

25 "is a community that has historically been burdened by the ill effects
of heavy industry contamination and pollution .. . And so we in
26 Boyle Heights are very sensitive to issues of environmental contamination and impacts. ... And let me tell you - this 27 environmental review which was 'let's just skip over Phase II
28 environmental assessment whether we can determine for sure or not

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

'1 the soil is contaminated' is another example of how this project was
2 forced through the Metro Board. . . . And, I must say, and I rarely use this language, lied to the community about what was being
uJ proposed. This is yet another example of how this project has
4 attempted to circumvent the process and the rules. And so
what's before us today is the enviroumental review and it Was
recommended to have a Phase II review, which was not done.
sense that in
6 We need to give the people of this community some fact the soil is not contaminated and that it is safe to build upon

7 that location. So I would recommend that we move to grant the
appeal in part with regard to CEQA and overturn the determination
8 of the Director of Planning in adopting the MND and MMP as

9 the environmental clearance for this project.*

11 5. Similarly, City Councilman and PLUM Committee member Mitch
P09I-LOLL61 J0014 .8 'anueMY oBUeJEI YUION Da WALSTMO Y AIBASRA A ON SH 12 Englander stated during the PLUM Committee hearing in pertinent part:

8 13 "It doesn't appear that they did a Phase II. . .. That's a serious
Pasadena, 14 concern.... We need housing of all types .. but with that too, it's
not at all cost . and with that it means that we've also got to have
15 good operators . LAPD ... just came and testified that there is an

16 issue at some of the other [ACOF] locations. . . . I also take issue with this operator and I want to go on record on that. .. I had a

17 meeting just last week with LAPD because of a project that they [ACOF] built in my district where we have so many calls for service.
18 Last week one of their residents walked out and did an attempted

19 rape on a senior 90 years old in her home. It was on the news because we released it because we knew it was more than one
20 incident .. . so location is an issue. Having a clean site is critically important. The most important. But having reputable operators are
21 important as well. .. . If this project were to move forward at all,
22 not only would I want personally to make sure that the people that would move in there would be safe, the ground would be
23 safe, full environmental would have to be done. The impacts to

24 the community from what you shared from traffic and the other concerns and crime ... a community safety plan, because of what
25 we've heard from LAPD and what I've experienced directly from these organizations."

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

•

'1 6. Despite these unambiguous statements and other substantial evidence
2 compelling the need for a Phase II environmental site assessment, other environmental
3 disclosure and mitigation, and the preparation of an EIR prior to any Project approval, the
4 City Council ultimately ignored its PLUM Committee's unanimous vote, including the
5 statements quoted above, and approved the Project in violation of CEQA and other laws.
6
7. Petitioners allege that a "fair argument" exists based upon substantial
7 evidence in the record to show that this Project may have significant, unmitigable impacts,
8 including in the areas of air quality and toxics, health risks, land use impacts, and impacts
9 to public services, including police services. As a result, the City's use of an MND to
10
approve the Project was illegal.
11 8. Petitioners seek a writ of mandate, inter alia, compelling the City to comply +09L-101161 J00k p.e 'enuaxy oBueJej quion SON HNS ANY BS 12 with CEQA and to prepare an EIR prior to consideration of any resolutions, legislative

16 entity that operates the cultural landmark El Mercado de Los Angeles shopping center in
17 Boyle Heights, located at 3425 East 1st Street, Los Angeles, which is adjacent to the
18 proposed Project. El Mercado is a business and cultural venue with special recognition in
19 the Boyle Heights Community Plan. In addition to its many tenants and vendors, tens of
20 thousands of patrons visit on a weekly basis, including many thousands of children. El
21 Mercado has been in operation at this site for approximately 50 years.
22 10. Petitioner Pedro A. Rosado is a principal of El Mercado de Los Angeles.
23 11. Petitioners have a substantial interest in ensuring that the City's decisions
24 are in conformity with the requirements of law, and in having those requirements properly
25 executed and the public duties of the City enforced. Petitioners will be adversely affected
26 by impacts resulting from the City's actions and approvals described herein, and are

5 13 STATUTORY FRAMEWORK
Pasaden 14 California Environmental Quality Act
% 15 20. The central purpose of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"),
16 found at Public Resources Code Section 21000, et seq., is to ensure that agencies and the 17 public are adequately informed of the environmental effects of proposed agency action.
18 21. In CEQA, the Legislature has established procedures designed to achieve
19 these goals, principally the Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"). These procedures
20 provide both for the determination and for full public disclosure of the potential adverse 21 effects on the environment of discretionary projects that governmental agencies propose to
22 approve, and require a description of feasible alternatives to such proposed projects and
23 feasible mitigation measures to lessen their environmental harm. (Pub. Res. Code §
24 21002.)
25 22. CEQA authorizes and directs the State Office of Planning and Research to
26 adopt guidelines for the implementation of CEQA by public agencies. (Pub. Res. Code §
27 21083.) These guidelines are found at title 14, California Code of Regulations, Section
28

- 6 -

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 15000, et seq. ("Guidelines").
2 23. CEQA is not merely a procedural statute; it imposes clear and substantive
3 responsibilities on agencies that propose to approve discretionary projects, requiring that 4 public agencies not approve projects that harm the environment unless and until all feasible
5 mitigation measures are employed to minimize that harm. (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002,
6 21002.1(b).)
7 24. A discretionary project is defined as "a project which requires the exercise
8 of judgment or deliberation when the public agency or body decides to approve or 9 disapprove a particular activity, as distinguished from situations where the public agency
10 or body merely has to determine whether there has been conformity with applicable
11
pogi-LOLl6 vo 'euapesed THE SILVERSTEIN LAW FIRM, 2oay pe 'anuany oBURJeÇ qION 9IZ statutes, ordinances, or regulations." (Guidelines §15267.) Where a project has both
12 ministerial and discretionary elements, it must be deemed to be discretionary and is subject
13 to the requirements of CEQA. (Guidelines § 15268; Friends of Westwood, Inc. v. City of
14 Los Angeles (1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 259.)
15 25. Failure either to comply with the substantive requirements of CEQA or to
16 carry out the full CEQA procedures so that complete information as to a project's impacts
17 is developed and publicly disclosed prior to project approval constitutes a prejudicial abuse
18 of discretion that requires invalidation of the public agency action regardless of whether
19 full compliance would have produced a different result. (Pub. Res. Code § 21005.)
20 26. Agencies may not undertake actions that could have a significant adverse
21 effect on the environment, or limit the choice of alternatives or mitigation measures, before
22 complying with CEQA. (Guidelines § 15004(b)(2).)
23 27. The "lead agency," which is the public agency that has the principal
24 responsibility for carrying out the project, is responsible for conducting an initial study
25 ("Initial Study") to determine, in consultation with other relevant agencies, whether an
26 environmental impact report, a negative declaration, or a mitigated negative declaration
27 will be prepared for a project. (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21067; 21080.1(a); 21083(a).)

28. CEQA defines a project as "the whole of an action, which has a potential for
2 resulting in either a direct physical change to the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable
3 indirect physical change in the environment." (Guidelines § 15378(a).)
4 29. An EIR must be prepared "[i]f there is substantial evidence, in light of the
5 whole record before the lead agency, that the project may have a significant effect on the
6 Il environment...." (Pub. Res. Code § 21080(d).) A strong presumption in favor of
7 requiring preparation of an EIR is built into CEQA. This presumption is reflected in what
8 is known as the "fair argument" standard, under which an agency must prepare an EIR
0 whenever substantial evidence in the record supports a fair argument that a project may 10 have a significant effect on the environment. Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n v. Jooll ye 'enuaay oBuaJe YLION 9IZ OdV WHIA MVT NIELSH3ATI THE S 11 Regents of the Univ. of Cal. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 1112, 1123; Communities for a Better 91-+01l6 vo 'suapese, 12 Environment v. California Resources Agency (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98, 111-112.
13 30. A project "may" have a significant effect on the environment if there is a
14 "reasonable probability" that it will result in a significant impact. No Oil, Inc. v. City of
15 Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 83, n. 16. If any aspect of the project may result in a
16 significant impact on the environment, an EIR must be prepared even if the overall effect
17 of the project is beneficial. Guidelines § 15063(b)(1). Moreover, an EIR must be prepared
18 "if a lead agency is presented with a fair argument that the project may have a significant
19 effect on the environment.. even though it may also be presented with other substantial
20 evidence that the project will not have a significant effect." (Guidelines § 15064(f)(1).)
21 31. •Because informing the public about the environmental impacts of a
22 proposed project is a critical function of CEQA, any proposed mitigation measures in an
23 MND must be made available for public review and comment prior to adoption of the
24 MND. (Pub. Res. Code § 21081.6(c).)
25
32. CEQA requires public agencies to allow the public to appeal a CEQA
26 determination to a public "agency's elected decision making body." Pub. Res. Code coa
27 21151(c).

33. At all times relevant to the allegations herein, the City had no specific
2 written procedure for an appeal of an EIR or MND.
3 34. CEQA's requirement to exhaust administrative remedies is satisfied if a
4 petitioner presented objections to the lead agency "prior to the close of the public hearing
5 on the project before the issuance of the notice of determination." Pub. Res. Code
6 21177(a).
7 35. A lead agency violates CEQA including if it abused its discretion either by
8 failing to proceed in the manner required by law or by making findings unsupported by
9 substantial evidence. (Pub. Res. Code § 21168.5.)

The history of the Project site includes industrial uses of a lumber mill and 14 an abandoned oil well.
15 37. The Project proposes the development of an approximately 90,000 square-
16 foot, 4- to 5-story, mixed-use development containing 49 apartment units and
17 approximately 10,000 square feet of ground-floor commercial space. The building height
18 would be approximately 70 feet to the top of the building parapet.
19 38. The Project application requested an affordable housing density bonus
20 incentive under the Los Angeles Municipal Code ("LAMC") subsection 12.22,A25. An
21 approval of such request is deemed discretionary by LAMC Section 12.22.A25(g).
22 39. El Mercado is a three-floor indoor shopping center located near the Project
23 site on 1st and Lorena Streets, that offers dining and restaurant services, entertainment with
24 live mariachi bands and shopping from various vendors. It is an important historical place

13 40. As part of the preparation of the Initial Study for the Project, the Project
14 applicant prepared a Phase I environmental review of the Project's potential impacts. This
15 Phase I addressed potential hazards at the Project site. The Phase I revealed that the
16 Project site contained potentially hazardous substances and recommended that a Phase II
17 study be prepared in order to determine risk to human health.
18 41. The City determined that CEQA review was required for the Project. The
19 City caused an MND for the Project to be prepared and circulated. The MND relies on and
20 references five (5) technical appendices: Appendix A, B, C, D, and E. Appendix C is the
21 Phase I Environmental Site Assessment ("Phase I" or "Phase I ESA") on which the MND
22 substantially relies for its conclusions of no significant impacts from the Project.
23 42. The City Council accepted and acted upon Petitioners' administrative appeal
24 of the Project, holding hearings on the adequacy of environmental review in response to
25 Petitioners' objections.

2 took action to declare it would continue the hearing to a future date to be determined. 3 44. Subsequently, without notice to Petitioners or their representative in the
4 administrative appeal, the City Clerk scheduled the re-scheduled hearing for August 8,
5 2017. Upon Petitioners' objection to the complete failure of notice of the re-scheduled
6 hearing, it was moved to August 15, 2017.
7 45. Throughout the administrative appeal process for the Project, Petitioners and
8 a multitude of surrounding community members expressed to the City their concerns,
9 including related to the environmental impacts and potential hazards (including air quality
10 and health risk impacts from unmitigated contamination on site) of the Project, and also 10011 p.8 'BnuBAY OBUBJEÇ YHION 9IZ OdV 'WAL MYTNIELSHBATS ZHL 11
pO9t-10ll6 vo'euapesed including the Project's location adjacent to exposed train tracks. Petitioners also presented
12 evidence relating to potentially significant safety and public services impacts due to the
13 concentration of ACOF residents with substance abuse and mental health concerns into an
14 area with heavy pedestrian traffic, including children. Indeed, the same concerns were
15 emphatically stated by City Councilman and PLUM Committee member Englander at the
16 PLUM hearing, based on intensified criminal complaints and demands on police services
17 he and his constituents have endured from ACOF projects in his Council district. (See,
18 e.g., T5, supra.) Petitioners objected to approval of the Project with the faulty MND and
19 submitted evidence and argument that an EIR was required prior to approving the Project.
20 46. The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (*Metro")
21 is the owner of the property where the Project would be sited. Metro has at all times
22 relevant herein expressed support for and cooperation with ACOF regarding review and 23 approval of the Project.
24 47. The Phase I Assessment prepared for the Initial Study on the Project
25 specifically recommends a Phase II Environmental Site Assessment to study the potential
26 presence of soil contamination. Yet no Phase II assessment was prepared and presented to
27 the decisionmakers prior to approving the Project. As stated in the MND, "[a] former oil

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 well is located onsite, approximately 154 feet north from the centerline of E. 1st Street and
2 162 feet east from the centerline of N. Lorena Street.3 The MND goes on to state that, 3 "The former oil well represents an environmental concern to the subject property due to the 4 common practice during drill activities to deposit soil cuttings from the well into nearby
5 pits or excavations" and that "it is likely that the abandonment of the oil-well in 1949 does
6 not meet current abandonment standards." It further explains that environmental concerns
7 generally associated with lumber yards and sawmills include the use and storage of
petroleum products, various lubricant/solvents, and wood treatment/preservative chemicals
9 (contaminants of concern include copper, arsenic, and chromium).
10 48. The MND also improperly concluded that, after the Project is approved, the

14 on site." (Emphasis added.) Petitioners are informed and believe, and based thereon
15 allege, that the MND was not circulated to DOGGR for comment. Petitioners are informed
16 and believe, and based thereon allege, that the MND was also not circulated to other
17 appropriate agencies for comment and consultation.
18
49. Petitioners objected that a Phase II study was required to be performed prior
19 to approval of the Project and that there was enough evidence of potentially significant
20 environmental impacts related to hazardous substances and toxics to require the
21 preparation of an EIR.
22 50. Petitioners submitted to the City and PLUM Committee a report assessing
23 Project impacts prepared by the SWAPE firm, authored by toxics expert Matt Hagemann
24 ("Hagemann Report"). The Hagemann Report in part states: "A DEIR is necessary to 25 include the results of soil sampling and a DOGGR-certified abandonment report of the oil
26 well." Additionally, it states: "There is no discussion of impacts of well abandonment,
27 including noise, air emissions, or generation of dust. A DEIR is necessary to discuss these

'1 impacts and to mitigate any impacts that were not identified in the IS/MND." Hagemann
2 further concluded: "the Project may have significant, unmitigable health risks and air
3 quality impacts, including during construction, by disturbance and excavation of
4 potentially contaminated soil."

51. Petitioners' objections to the Project also included that the location of the
6 Project would conflict with land use policies of the Boyle Heights Community Plan, and
7 that there would be significant impacts to public services, including demands for increased
8 police services.
9
52. On August 15, 2017, the PLUM Committee moved to recommend that the

14 action on the Project occurred and no new environmental review was presented publicly
15 &i for the Project.
16 54. On or around February 22, 2018, Real Party ACOF submitted a letter
17 (hereinafter "ACOF Letter") to the City indicating that certain aspects of the Project would
18 be voluntarily changed and purported to propose "substitute mitigation" for various
19 impacts from the Project. Regarding toxics, none of the proposed changes made were
20 pursuant to any Phase II study. In fact, despite the fact that the PLUM Committee
21 recommended a Phase II study be performed and an EIR required for the Project, the
22 ACOF Letter proposed that the Project be approved with the MND and without the benefit
23 of a Phase II study having been conducted prior to approval of the Project.
24 55. The City Council scheduled a hearing on the matter for March 2, 2018.

4 58. The Staff Memorandum was deliberately delayed, withheld from, and not
5 made available to Petitioners until approximately 24 hours prior to the March 2, 2018 City
6 Council meeting.

15 62. The City's findings include a determination that the substituted mitigation
16 measures "have been incorporated into the Project" and that "the mitigation measures have

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
10 (Violation of CEQA And CEQA Guidelines;
11 Improper Approval of Mitigated Negative Declaration) PO9L-LoLL6 APC DO HES BROROY ALRRA CLON 4 MYT NEISRAE XTOS 12 71. Petitioners reallege and incorporate herein by reference the allegations of
13 8 Paragraphs 1 through 70, inclusive, of this petition. euapesed 14 72. The record contains substantial evidence to support a fair argument in light 15 of the whole record that the Project may cause significant, unmitigable impacts to the
16 environment, including but not limited to, air quality and hazardous materials, land use
17 impacts, and impacts to public services including infrastructure, police, fire and
18 paramedics.
19 73. An MND may only be used when the mitigation measures can be clearly
20 shown to reduce any environmental impacts from the project in question to the level of
21 insignificance. (Pub. Res. Code § 21064.5; Guidelines sop 15070(b)(1).) The City did not
22 make that showing. The MND's reliance on mitigation measures was faulty because,
23 inter alia, those mitigation measures do not address soil contamination threatened at the
24 site and the MND does not even state that the mitigation measure will reduce impacts to a
25 level of insignificance, but rather "to the fullest extent possible."
26 74. Petitioners are informed and believe, and based thereon allege, that the
27 Project approvals must be invalidated because the City: (a) approved the Project prior to

1 completion of environmental review; (b) deferred study and mitigation of critical
2 environmental issues; and (c) acknowledged, including through statements by City 3 Councilmembers in the record, that the Project may have significant impacts in the areas,
4 inter alia, of hazardous materials, public services, and public safety, but failed to mitigate
5 them to a less than significant level.
6
75. The City abused its discretion in adopting an MND which fails to disclose
7 actual data demonstrating the efficacy of the mitigation measures upon which the MND
8 relies for its finding of insignificant impacts.
9 76. By adopting an MND for the Project, the City prejudicially abused its
10 discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law as described herein,

8 13 77. In violation of Public Resources Code Section 21082.2(d), the City refused Pasadena, 14
to prepare an EIR or further study any of the issues raised by Petitioners, other members of
15 the public, and the City Councilmembers themselves prior to the City's approval of the
16 Project and MND for the Project.
17 78. Petitioners as well as members of the general public will suffer irreparable
18 harm if the relief requested herein is not granted and the Project is allowed to proceed and
19 operate in the absence of a full and adequate EIR and absent compliance with all other
20 applicable provisions of CEQA and other laws.

23 79. Petitioners reallege and incorporate herein by reference the allegations of
24 Paragraphs 1 through 78, inclusive, of this petition.
25 80. The Initial Study upon which the Mitigated Negative Declaration is based
26 must describe the environmental setting and identify environmental impacts, as well as
27 make an examination of whether the Project would be consistent with existing zoning and

•

1 other applicable land use controls.
2 81. The MND is fatally flawed and not even minimally compliant with CEQA.
3 The MND is internally inconsistent and confusing, characterizing many environmental
4 effects that will be caused by the Project as potentially significant, but allegedly
5

6 insignificant "with mitigation," without actually setting out and requiring the mitigation
upon which those findings are based. Many determinations in the MND are unsupported
7 by any facts, or are premised on inadequate facts, lacking any analysis of facts, or
8 consisting of a superficial and conclusory "analysis" which for the most part simply
9 assumes its conclusion. Moreover, the MND failed to properly disclose and address
10 cumulative impacts because it failed to include all reasonably foreseeable related projects APC WHL MVI NIELSYJATS 2H1 11
+09|-+0LL6 Jo0w ut 'anuany oBueJem YUON in its Related Projects list.
12 82. Due to the inadequacy of the MND, the decision makers, and the public
8 13
Pasadena, have not been fully informed of the adverse environmental impacts of the Project,
14 including, but not limited to, impacts regarding air quality, toxic substances, health risks,
C 15 land use incompatibility and conflicts, and impacts to public services, including police.
16 83. Petitioners are informed and believe, and based thereon allege, that the
17 Initial Study/MND does not adequately address the impacts of the Project on human health
18 and safety due to potentially contaminated soil. The Hagemann Report states that such
19 potentially significant risks exist due to the Project. The MND is inadequate in its review
20 of air quality impacts and hazards, and a fair argument for significant impacts exists,
21 requiring preparation of an EIR because construction of the Project would result in
22 significant impacts related to the potential release of hazardous materials into the
23 environment. Petitioners are informed and believe, and based thereon allege, that the
24 Project will create, inter alia, air quality and safety issues that require study in an EIR.
25 84. Petitioners are informed and believe, and based thereon allege, that the City
26 abused its discretion in failing to prepare an adequate Initial Study/Mitigated Negative
27 Declaration, thus failing to comply with CEQA's informational requirements. By

1 process. (See Pub. Resources Code, § 21003.1; No Oil, Inc. v. City
of Los Angeles, supra, 13 Cal.3d 68, 84.) In Bozung v. Local 2 Agency Formation Com., supra, 13 Cal.3d 263, 282, the Supreme
4J p t lo Court approved "the principle that the environmental impact should be assessed as early as possible in government planning." Environmental problems should be considered at a point in the planning process "where genuine flexibility remains." (Mount Sutro Defense Committee y. Regents of University of California, supra, 77 Cal.App.3d 20, 34.) A study conducted after approval of a project will inevitably have a diminished influence on 7 decisionmaking. Even if the study is subject to administrative approval, it is analogous to the sort of post hoc rationalization of 8
agency actions that has been repeatedly condemned in decisions 9 construing CEQA. (Id. at p. 35; No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, supra, 13 Cal.3d 68, 81; Environmental Defense Fund. Inc.

Mitigation measures to be developed based on a post hoc Phase II
13 environmental assessment fails to adequately inform the public and decisionmakers, prior §
euapesed 14 to Project approval, of the nature and efficacy of proposed mitigation measures that may be

15 undertaken.

Petitioners are informed and believe, and based thereon allege, that the City 16 91.

17 improperly approved the Project while expressly deferring completion of a Phase II study,

18 as well as deferring other studies, consideration of alternatives, and potential mitigation

19 measures, all in violation of CEQA.

92. Neither the Real Party ACOF nor the City provided any good reason for the 20

21 failure to conduct the Phase II, or to order it conducted and completed, before the City

22 considered voting to approve the Project and MND. Approving the Project without this

23 study was an abuse of discretion.

93. The additional proposed mitigation measures (*substituted mitigation")
25 which were not circulated with the MND do not support a finding of no substantial 24

27 are mitigated to a less-than-significant level as is required to approve

4 no substantial evidence in light of the whole record before the public agency that the
5 project, as revised, may have a significant effect on the environment").
6
95. Moreover, the City's purported adoption of a "written finding that the new
7 measure is equivalent or more effective in mitigating or avoiding potential significant 8 effects and that it in itself will not cause any potentially significant effect on the
9 environment" (Guidelines § 15074.1(b)(2)), is void or voidable as lacking in support

13 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
14 (Violation of CEQA And CEQA Guidelines; Failure to Properly Circulate
15 3 MND/Initial Study and Consult with Responsible Agencies)
16 97. Petitioners reallege and incorporate herein by reference the allegations of
17 Paragraphs 1 through 96, inclusive, of this petition.
18 98. In the original MND, the City proposed mitigation measure VII-160. That
which will review plans 19 mitigation measure specifically identified DOGGR as an agency
20 to approve reabandonment of the oil well on the Project site. Despite identifying such a
21 Responsible Agency in the MND itself, the record is devoid of any evidence that the City
22 either: (1) consulted with DOGGR (no agencies consulted listed in the MND), or (2) sent
23 the proposed MND to DOGGR to comment upon the analysis, the supporting Phase I ESA,
24 the lack of a Phase II ESA, and specific mitigation measures DOGGR would require in
25 order to sign off on the well abandonment.
26 99. The record shows that the City violated CEQA, including Guidelines §§
27 15072 (a) and 15073(c), because it failed to circulate the notice of intent to adopt the MND
28
• 20 -

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1
and the MND (including the Initial Study and its technical reports that provide data the
2 City cites/incorporates in support of its conclusions) "to the public, responsible agencies,
3 trustee agencies, and the ounty clerk of each county within which the proposed project is
4 located, sufficiently prior to adoption by the lead agency of the negative declaration or
5 mitigated negative declaration to allow the public and agencies the review period provided
6 under Section 15105." (Emphasis added.)
7 100. CEQA requires an MND and supporting documents to be viewable by the
8 public. Guidelines §§ 15072(g)(4), 15074(b), 15150(b). Guidelines § 15150(b) requires:
9 "Where part of another document is incorporated by reference, such other document shall
10 be made available for public inspection" and that "[a]t a minimum, the incorporated 100kl pig 'enuey ofuaJeW qpIoN 11
po9i-0kl6 vO 'euspesed 8 SA IS S document shall be made available to the public in an office of the lead agency. . . ." Here,
12 the City violated these requirements by not making available the very data and analysis on
13 which the Initial Study and MND rely.
14 101. Petitioners are informed and believe, and based thereon allege, that prior to
15 Project approval, the City had failed to properly circulate the MND. Having failed to
16 circulate the MND to DOGGR, a responsible agency, and other potential responsible 17 agencies, during the public/agency review process a was a failure to proceed in accordance 18 with law.
19 102. Additionally, the City in its March 1, 2018 Staff Memorandum admitted that
20 the MND was not circulated with the full Initial Study including its supporting studies.
21 Guidelines § 15071(d) requires that the contents of a "negative declaration circulated for
22 public review shall include ... [a]n attached copy of the initial study documenting reasons
23 to support the finding." The table of contents of the Initial Study circulated by the City in
24 this case lists Appendices A, B, C, D, E as containing information that is part of and
25 supporting the conclusions of the Initial Study.
26 103. The law and regulations mandate that the entire Initial Study be attached to
27 the negative declaration "circulated for public review." The purpose of the public review
28

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 process would be defeated if the City was not required to circulate all the information it
2 knows so that the public, responsible agencies, and trustee agencies can fulfill their role in
3 the CEQA review process.
4 104. Having conceded that it failed to attach all the supporting studies that it
5 specifically identified as part of the Initial Study to the public and DOGGR, the City failed
6 to proceed in accordance with law when it approved the Project without first recirculating
7 the MND to cure these fatal defects.
8 105. When new ostensible mitigation measures are added for previously
9 undisclosed impacts, re-circulation of the MND and revised mitigation plan is mandatory.
10 Guidelines § 15073.5(b) defines "substantial revision" of an MND to mean either: "(1) A 1001 pg 'anuary North Mareng OdV 'WHH MVT NESHEATS! 11
+09L-L01l6 vo 'euapesed new, avoidable significant effect is identified and mitigation measures or project revisions
12 must be added in order to reduce the effect to insignificance, or (2) The lead agency
13 determines that the proposed mitigation measures or project revisions will not reduce
14 potential effects to less than significance and new measures or revisions must be required."
#% 15 106. Just prior to the City Council's final hearing on the Project, the City raised
16 the curtain on a new direction and new proposal. Instead of adopting the recommendation
17 of the PLUM Committee that the appeal be granted and an EIR required, the City proposed
18 to adopt what it claimed was a "substitute mitigation measure" under CEQA Guideline !
19 15074.1. However, the proposed mitigation measure is no longer limited to only DOGGR,
20 and in no way can be considered a substitute mitigation measure. The City was confronted
21 with detailed comments that demonstrate the City failed to adopt enforceable mitigation to
22 address the methane intrusion risk, or to address the likely hazardous materials on site from
23 the drilling of the oil well and decades of use as a lumber yard with poisons and solvents.
24 In response, the City proposed to conduct a deferred, post-Project approval, Phase II ESA,
25 and contact any agency that must review and approve clean-up of the site to devise
26 undisclosed mitigation plans later. The list of potential agencies that must review and
27 approve remediation at the site could include DOGGR, South Coast Air Quality
28
22 -

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

Management District, Regional Water Control Board, Department of Toxic Substances
2 Control, or other agencies.
3 107. The development of this "substitute mitigation," because it implies the City
4 agrees fair argument exists of other significant impacts from methane and other toxic
5 contaminants, far exceeds the scope of a "substitute mitigation" for the original DOGGR
6 mitigation measure VII-160. The implicit admission that more agencies must review and
7 sign off on mitigation of potential contamination is a significant new mitigation measure.
8 New effects are implied by the purposely vaguely written new measure, including
9 indicating that more agencies than just DOGGR must approve any clean-up of the site if
10 the Phase II ESA reveals there is any contamination. Having conceded greater or new
J00l .,€ 'anueAy obuaJeYN qJON APC 'WHIS MVTNIEISHEATS SHI 11
b09-LOLL6 VO teuapesed impacts than first analyzed, the new mitigation measure to more than DOGGR means it is
12 not just a "substitute mitigation measure," but rather a new one. In turn, that additionally
13 mandates re-circulation of the revised MND and Initial Study to the public and all the
14 Responsible Agencies that may have input and/or to sign off on the site clean up.
15 108. Moreover, as to the eleventh-hour so-called mitigation measures proposed %
16 approximately two business days prior to the final City Council vote, the City also violated
17 CEQA in that the City was required to recirculate the MND - even assuming an MND
18 were an appropriate CEQA document, and even assuming those mitigation measures were
19 valid, both of which contentions Petitioners dispute - because of significant changes to the
20 Project and/or mitigation measures. A developer cannot expect to avoid preparing an EIR
21 by attempting to cure inadequacies in the original MND simply by presenting information
22 at the eleventh hour and after the MND is circulated for review. See, e.g., Save Our
23 Peninsula v. Monterey County Board of Supervisors (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 99, at 124
24 (information about baseline "occurred at the very end of the environmental review process,
25 thus avoiding public scrutiny and precluding the meaningful comparison of preproject and
26 postproject conditions required by CEQA").
27 109. Substantial revisions were made to the MND that required recirculation,
