were prematurely filed because the City Council did not approve the Project and certify the EIR

3 CEOA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS

18. In 1970, the California Legislature enacted CEQA, as a means of forcing public
5 agency decision makers, such as Respondent, to document and consider the environmental

6 implications of its actions. CEQA's fundamental goal is to fully inform the public and the
7 decision makers as to the environmental consequences of proposed projects and to assure
8 members of the public that their elected officials are making informed decisions. CEQA requires
9 governmental authorities, such as Respondent, to fully evaluate potential environmental effects
of projects, and to seek feasible means to reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that 10

11 otherwise could result from their actions, CEQA limits agencies from approving projects with ® •IZ06 8 yltf paen dog Áuereg euns "pAla aJjysIM 00Zg 12 significant adverse impacts when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen such impacts.

13 19. The primary function of an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") is to discuss the
14 important environmental consequences of the project, including cumulative effects, and to
15 provide the agency and the general public with mitigation measures and alternatives to the
16 project that would have Jess serious environmental consequences. Under CEQA lead agencies,
17 such as Respondent, are required to prepare a complete and legally adequate EIR prior to
18  approving any discretionary project a that may have a significant adverse effect on the
19 environment. The EIR must fully disclose and adequately analyze the project's potentially

20 significant environmental effects. CEQA also requires lead agencies, such as Respondent, to
21 consider mitigation measures and alternatives to a project, adopt all feasible mitigation measures

22 and/or alternatives, determine whether proposed mitigation measures will be effective in
23 avoiding or substantially lessening the project's significant environmental impacts, and to make
24 adequate findings, including an adequate statement of overriding consideration for those
25 significant environmental impacts deemed unavoidable.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
2 (VIOLATION OF CEQA: EIR Does Not Comply with CEQA)
3 20. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
4 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
5 21. CEQA requires a lead agency for a project to prepare an EIR that complies with
6 the requirements of the statute. The lead agency must also provide for public review and
7 comment on the project and associated environmental documentation. An EIR must provide
8 sufficient environmental analysis such that decision-makers can intelligently consider
environmental consequences when acting on proposed projects.
10 22. Respondents violated CEQA by certifying an EIR for the Project that is
11
MET IOUUBYd Group, d77 LLZ06 D  AS TP EB P H US IPRA COZ8 'SillH Aueseg inadequate and fails to comply with CEQA. Among other things, Respondent:
12 a. Failed to adequately analyze identified alternatives to the project and to mitigate impacts
13 by selecting a less impactful, feasible alternative to the Project without adopting a valid
14 statement of overriding considerations;
15 b. Failed to adequately analyze the environmental impacts of the Project by screening out
16 environmental factors related to the following: Hazards & Hazardous Materials, Mineral
17 Resources, Public Services, Utilities/Service Systems; Aquiculture Resources; Cultural
18 Resources; Hydrology/Water Quality; Recreation; Geology/Soils; Population/Housing.
19 23. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion
20 by certifying an EIR that does not comply with CEQA and by approving the Project in reliance
21 thereon. Accordingly, Respondent's certification of the EIR and approval of the Project must be
22 set aside.

23 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
24 (VIOLATION OF CEQA: Inadequate Findings)
25 24. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
26 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
27

28 6

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 25. CEQA requires that a lead agency's findings for the approval of a project be

2 supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. CEQA further requires that lead
agency provide an explanation of how evidence in the record supports the conclusions it has

4 reached.

5 26. Respondents violated CEQA by adopting findings that are inadequate as a matter
6 of law in that they are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, including, but not

7 limited to, the following.

8 The adoption of the Statement of Overriding Considerations;
b. The determination that the Project would, cause no potentially significant impacts on the a.

10 following environmental factors: Hazards & Hazardous Materials, Mineral Resources,
11 Public Services, Utilities/Service Systems; Aquiculture Resources; Cultural Resources; 8 d11 'dnoJg Mel ¡auueyo LIZ06 12 Hydrology/Water Quality; Recreation; Geology/Soils; Population/Housing; a}nS "PAIE eJJYSI!M 0OZ8 13 c. The determination that the Project was exempt from CEQA; 8
'SIllH Auereg 14 d. The determination that certain impacts would be less than significant and/or that adopted
15 mitigation measures would avoid or lessen the Project's significant effects on the
16 environment;

17 e. The determination that alternatives to the Project and proposed mitigation measures that

18 would have avoided or lessened the significant impacts of the Project were infeasible;

19 f. The determination that alternatives considered would not meet project objectives.

20 27. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their
21 discretion by adopting findings that do not comply with the requirements of CEQA and
22 approving the Project in reliance thereon. Accordingly, Respondents' certification of the EIR and
23 approval of the Project must be set aside.
THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION 24

25 (VIOLATION OF CEQA: Inadequate Response to Comments)
26 28. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
27

7 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1  their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
2 29. Respondents failed to respond adequately to comments submitted by Petitioner,
3 other members of the public, and other agencies. Instead, the responses given to numerous
comments regarding the Project's impacts were dismissive, conclusory, evasive, confusing, or

5 otherwise non-responsive, contrary to the requirements of CEQA.

6 30. By failing to provide adequate responses to public comments and proposed
7 alternatives, Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law. Moreover,
8 Respondents' finding that adequate responses to comments were provided is not supported by
9 substantial evidence.

10 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

11 (VIOLATION OF CEQA: Unsupported Statement of Overriding Considerations) § d'11 'dnoJ9 ME] jeuueu) LIZ06 12 31. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth
13 8 eyns "pALa euuS|IM 00Z8 above.

Beverly Hills, 14 32. Prior to approving a project for which an EIR has been certified, CEQA requires
to adopt one of three possible findings concerning each significant impact 15 the lead agency
16  identified in the EIR ("CEQA Findings"). The CEQA Findings must be supported by substantial
17  evidence in the administrative record of proceedings.

18 33. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by failing to proceed in the

19 manner required by law by adopting CEQA Findings that are not supported by substantial
20 evidence. For example, Respondents failed to provide substantial evidence of the Project's

21 purported multi-modal transit impacts, thereby precluding accurate conclusions concerning the

22 minimization of such impacts.

34. Where a significant impact cannot be mitigated to a less-than-significant level, 23

24 CEQA allows a lead agency to adopt what is known as a "statement of overriding

25 considerations." (Public Resources Code § 21081, subd. (b).)

35. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by failing to proceed in the 26
manner required by law by adopting a Statement of Overriding Considerations that is not 27

2 overstated its anticipated benefits.

4 Respondents must be prohibited from taking any further actions with respect to the Project until 3 36. Accordingly, the Project Approvals must be set aside and declared void.

5 they have complied with the applicable legal requirements.

FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

(VIOLATION OF CEQA: Improper Adoption of Exemption) 7

37. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
38. The city improperly concluded that the project qualified for both a statutory 10

11 exemption and several categorical exemptions under CEQA.
SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION § d71 'dnoJ9 L-Z06 12

(DECLARATORY RELIEF) 13 8 elns "pAIa eJysIIM 00Zg are pema coge Aueseg 14 39. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
15 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

40. Petitioner seeks a judicial declaration that Respondents' adoption of a Mitigated
17 Negative Declaration for the Project failed to comply with the requirements of CEQA. 16

18 41. Respondents have a mandatory duty to comply with CEQA and other legal
19 requirements applicable to the Project.

20 42. Petitioner has the right to enforce these mandatory duties.

21 43. Petitioner has no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy at law, and will suffer
22 irreparable injury unless it receives the relief requested in this Petition.

23 44. An actual controversy exists between Petitioner and Respondents as to whether
24 the actions and conduct of Respondents alleged in this Petition have violated CEQA and other
25 laws as identified herein. This controversy implicates the legality of the manner in which
26 Respondents have proceeded in giving the Project Approvals, the validity of the Respondents'
27 actions with respect thereto and, consequently, the legal ability of Respondents to take further
9 28

each and all such actions and conduct have violated and will violate these laws. Petitioner is

informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that Respondents dispute these contentions. A
judicial resolution of that controversy is now required pursuant to California Code of Civil
Procedure section 1060.

45. Petitioner requests a judicial declaration that Respondents' actions and conduct
alleged in. this Petition have violated and will violate CEQA and other laws identified herein.

8 Such declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time under the circumstances in order that
Petitioner and Respondents may ascertain their rights and duties.
10 46. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.
11 No money damages or other legal remedy could adequately compensate Petitioner for the harms 00€ Channel Law Group, LLP 41Z06 EZOS MPNLE MAHASLIAA COZ8 Beverly Hills, 12 described in the preceding paragraphs.
