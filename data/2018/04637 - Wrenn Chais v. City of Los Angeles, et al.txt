VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. Petitioner WRENN CHAIS ("Petitioner") hereby challenges the approval of

3 Respondent CITY OF LOS ANGELES ("City") of the construction, use and maintenance of a

4 new 36-foot tall single family residence containing 2,710 square feet of residential floor area with

5 a 465 square foot attached two car garage and three uncovered parking spaces on a vacant,

6 upslope, 6,832 square foot lot at 3314 N. Lugano Place, in Hollywoodland ("Project").
2. In approving the Project, the City erroneously relied on two California
Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") exemptions: a Class 3, Category 1 exemption for Single
Family Residences and a Class 32 exemption for In-Fill Development. As set forth herein, the

10 Categorical Exemptions were adopted in error because the Project does not qualify for the

11 Categorical Exemptions; will cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of the

12 Hollywoodland historical resources; will degrade the existing visual character of the Project site

13 and its surroundings; will cause cumulative impacts which are not considered; will significantly

14 impact wildlife and wildlife access; and fails to consider the environmental impacts previously

15 identified by the City for at the Project location.

16 3. Furthermore, as further set forth herein, the City's findings of approval for the

17 Project is not supported by substantial evidence.

18 4. For all of the reasons set forth herein, the Court must set the Project aside and

19 require environmental review in conformance with CEQA, as well as substantial evidence to

20 support the Project prior to any re-approval.

21 JURISDICTION

22 5. This Court has jurisdiction over the instant action under §§1085 and 1094.5 of the

23 Code of Civil Procedure, and $§21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.

24 PARTIES

25 6. Petitioner is an individual residing at 3267 Ledgewood Drive, immediately

26 adjacent to the Project. Petitioner has a substantial interest in ensuring that the City's decisions

27 are in conformity with the requirements of law, including CEQA, and in having those

28 requirements properly executed and the public duties of the City enforced. Petitioner will be

-2-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 adversely affected by impacts resulting from the City's actions, approvals and inactions as

2 described herein, and is aggrieved by the acts, decisions and omissions of the City, as alleged in

3 this Petition. Petitioner is suing on her behalf, and on behalf of others who will be affected in the

4 Hollywoodland area, as well as all citizens of the City of Los Angeles.

5 7. Respondent City is a municipal corporation, organized and existing under the laws

6 of the state of California, located within the County of Los Angeles. The City has the duty and
7 responsibility to proceed in accordance with law and ensure that all discretionary approvals

8 comply with all applicable laws, including CEQA. Public Resources Code §21000 et. seq.; and

9 14 Cal. Code Regs. §15000 et. seq.

10 8. Real Party in Interest STEPHANIE SAVAGE ("Savage") is an individual; the

11 owner of the real property upon which the Project is proposed; an "Applicant" as listed in filings

12 for the Project approvals described herein; a proposed developer of the Project; and an entity to

13 whom the City purported to grant Project approvals. As such, Savage is an entity whose interest

14 is directly affected by the proceeding and is named as a Real Party in Interest.

15 9. Real Party in Interest MICHAEL SWISCHUK ("Swischuk") is an individual; the

16 owner of the real property upon which the Project is proposed; an "Applicant" as listed in filings

17 for the Project approvals described herein; a proposed developer of the Project; a and an entity to

18 whom the City purported to grant Project approvals. As such, Swischuk is an entity whose interest

19 is directly affected by the proceeding and is named as a Real Party in Interest.

20 10. Collectively, Swischuk and Savage are referred to herein as "Real Parties."

21 11. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Respondents or other Real

22 Parties in Interest sued herein as DOES 1-25, inclusive, and ROES 1-25, inclusive, and, therefore,

23 sues these individuals and/or entities by such fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this Petition

24 to allege the true names and capacities of fictitiously named parties when ascertained. Petitioner

25 is informed, believes and thereon alleges that each party designated herein as a DOE and/or a

26 ROE is responsible for the events and happenings alleged in this petition or has a beneficial

27 interest in the discretionary actions challenged herein.

12. Petitioner is informed, believes and thereon alleges that at all times herein

2 mentioned, Respondents or other Real Parties in Interest, and each of them, were the agents,

3 servants, employees, partners, and alter egos of the remaining Respondents or other Real Parties
in Interest, that the acts complained of herein were done within the course and scope of said

5 agency, service, employment, and partnership, and that the acts by each Respondent or other Real

6 Party in Interest were ratified, approved and adopted by each of the remaining Respondents or
Real Parties in Interest. Wherever the terms "Respondents," or "Real Parties in Interest" is used

8 herein, it shall mean "Respondents and/or other Real Parties in Interest, and each of them."
STATEMENT OF FACTS

10 13. The Project is proposed at 3314 N. Lugano Place, in the original Hollywoodland

11 Tract, planned and established in the early 1920's as a custom home, single-family subdivision

12 with a "European Village" aesthetic and character. All of the individual resources within
13 Hollywoodland, including its residences, make up the historic environment of the area.

14 14. In 1992, the City adopted, by Ordinance No. 168,121, the Hollywoodland Specific
15 Plan ("Specific Plan"). As relevant hereto, the stated purposes of the Specific Plan are to protect

16 the unique and historical residential community of Hollywoodland; to ensure that new

17 development on the vacant lots in Hollywoodland enhances the character of the community rather
18' than compromises its integrity; to protect Hollywoodland as it was in the early decades of the

19 Hollywoodland Tract, when the initial deed restrictions and design review process produced a

20 series of architectural styles consisting of Mediterranean, English, French and other traditional

21 cottages and villas ("otherwise known as the "European Village" styles) having uniformly high

22 quality design and construction; to permit and facilitate new development as long as it is

23 compatible with and enhances the character and quality of the existing community; to protect and

24 enhance the buildings, structures, sites and area of Hollywoodland which are a reminder of the

25 City's history and are unique and irreplaceable assets to the City and to the Hollywood

26 Community; and to ensure that new development in the Hollywoodland Specific Plan area is not

27 detrimental to the surrounding community.

28 ///

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

15. In gist, the Specific Plan protects the unique, historical aesthetics of the
Hollywoodland tract which is made up of "European Village" style single family homes.
16. On or about March 9, 2017, Real Parties filed an application, with the City's
Department of City Planning ("City Planning"), for Project entitlements which included a

5 "Project Permit Compliance Review" under Los Angeles Municipal Code ("LAMC") $11.5.7 and

6 "Design Review" under LAMC §16.05.
17. On or about May 25, 2017, the Hollywoodland Design Review Board ("DRB"), a
duly authorized advisory board whose role us to review projects proposed in the Hollywoodland

9 tract for conformity with the Specific Plan and to make recommendations of approval,
10 disapproval, or approval with recommendations for modifications such projects, met at a regularly

11 scheduled public meeting and considered the Project. Many concerned members of the public,

12 including the Petitioner, appeared at the DRB meeting and testified against the Project, and its

13 non-conformity with the Specific Plan.

14 18. At that meeting, the DRB found that the Project failed to comply with the Specific

15 Plan for many reasons, including and most importantly because it failed to adhere to the requisite

16 "European Village" aesthetic required by the Specific Plan. The DRB asked that Real Parties

17 revise the Project.

18 19. On or about July 6, 2017 and October 5, 2017, the DRB further considered the

19 Project, as revised by the Applicant, and, at all times, found that the Project, as revised, continued

20 to not comply with the Specific Plan for many reasons, including and most importantly because

21 it failed to adhere to the requisite "European Village" aesthetic required by the Specific Plan. At

22 such hearings, many concerned members of the public, including the Petitioner, appeared and

23 testified against the Project and its non-conformity with the Specific Plan.

24 20. At the DRB hearings, Real Parties' position was simple, they claimed that as long

25 as they met the requisite number of "points" required under the Specific Plan, they did not need

26 to and would not adhere to the requisite "European Village" aesthetic required by the Specific

27 Plan. Accordingly, any and all revisions made to their plans were not only minor, they did not

28 bring the structure into conformity with the "European Village" aesthetic.

-5-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

21. On or about October 5, 2017, the DRB voted, 5-1, to recommend disapproval of

2 the Project because it failed to comply with the purposes of the Specific Plan and failed to comply

3 with the European Village style/aesthetic.

22. Despite the DRB recommendation of disapproval, on December 4, 2017, City
Planning approved the Project. In its approval, City Planning failed to findings of conformity with

6 the Specific Plan which are substantiated with evidence.
23. The City's December 4, 2017 determination included the adoption of Categorical
Exemptions for the Project under Class 3, Category (Single Family Residences) and Class 32
(In-Fill Development).

10 24. On or about December 18, 2017, Petitioner timely filed an appeal of City

11 Planning's determination to the Central Area Planning Commission ("CAPC"). Petitioner's

12 appeal contended, in relevant part, that the Project did not substantially comply with the
13 Hollywoodland Specific Plan, and that the Categorical Exemptions adopted for the Project were

14 inadequate under CEQA.

15 25. On or about February 26, 2018, the CAPC met at a regularly scheduled hearing

16 and considered Petitioner's appeal. Again, many concerned members of the public, including

17 Petitioner, appeared and testified against the Project, and its non-conformity with the Specific

18 Plan.

19 26. After taking testimony and closing the public hearing, the CAPC denied

20 Petitioner's appeal. In denying the appeal, the CAPC failed to make findings of conformity with
the Specific Plan which are substantiated with evidence. Indeed, the CAPC readily admitted that

22 the Project failed to comply with the "European Village" aesthetic required by the Specific Plan,

23 but erroneously accepted the incorrect position of the Planning Department which claimed that

24 the City could not deny the Project based on non-conformity with the "European Village"

25 aesthetic.

26 27. On or about March 14, 2018, the City Planning Commission issued a Letter of

27 Determination regarding its February 26, 2018 actions.

28 ///

-6-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

28. On or about March 21, 2018, Petitioner timely filed an appeal of the Categorical
Exemptions adopted in connection with the Project to the City Council. Petitioner's appeal
contended, in relevant part, that the Categorical Exemptions adopted for the Project were
inadequate under CEQA.

5 29. On or about May 15, 2018, the Planning and Land Use Management Committee

6 (hereinafter referred to a as the "PLUM Committee"), a standing committee of the City Council,
met at a regularly scheduled hearing and considered Petitioner's appeals. Again, many concerned

8 members of the public, including Petitioner appeared and testified against the Project, its many
adverse impacts and the inadequacy of the Categorical Exemption.

10 30. After taking testimony and closing the public hearing, the PLUM Committee made

11 recommendations that the full City Council to deny Petitioner's appeal, adopt the findings of the

12 CAPC and determine that the Categorical Exemptions adopted for the Project were adequate

13 under CEQA.

14 31. On or about June 5, 2018, the matter came to the City Council as a whole. The a

15 City Council adopted the PLUM Committee's report and recommendations.

16 32. As set forth above, Petitioner objected to the Project, and its environmental

17 clearance under CEQA, during the administrative process, including submitting letters, filing

18 appeals and testifying during public hearings for the Project, thereby exhausting her

19 administrative remedies.

20 33. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

21 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate and injunctive relief.

22 34. Petitioner is informed, believes and thereon alleges that unless the City and Real

23 Parties are restrained and enjoined from the issuance of grading and building permits as well as

24 any construction of the Project before the Court's determination on the merits in this action,

25 Petitioner and the general public will suffer great and irreparable harm. Without injunctive relief,

26 Petitioner and the public would be denied their rightful remedies if the Project was allowed to

27 proceed with development and thereafter the Court determines that the Categorical Exemptions

28 and Project approvals must be set aside on any of the grounds asserted herein.

-7-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

35. Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code §21167.5 by providing the
City with notice of intention to commence the within action. [Exhibit A].

3 36. Petitioner requests that Respondents prepare the administrative record [Exhibit B
hereto].

5 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

6 VIOLATION OF CEQA
37. Petitioners repeat, reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation

8 contained in Paragraphs 1-36, inclusive, as though fully set forth herein.

9 38. CEQA, enacted in California Public Resources Code §§21000-21177, was enacted

10 to ensure that the long-term protection of the environment, consistent with the provision of a

11 decent home and suitable living environment for every Californian, shall be the guiding criterion

12 in public decisions.

13 39. CEQ requires that prior to approval of any discretionary project, the environmental

14 effects of that project be evaluated on the existing environment.

15 40. CEQA requires strict compliance with the procedures and mandates of the statute.

16 41. CEQA is not merely a procedural statute. It imposes clear and substantive

17 responsibilities on agencies that propose to approve projects, requiring such agencies to not

18 approve projects that harm the environment unless and until all feasible mitigation measures are

19 employed to minimize that harm.

20 42. Failure to comply with the substantive requirements of CEQA or to carry out the

21 full CEQA procedures so that complete information of a project's impacts is developed and

22 publicly disclosed constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion that requires invalidation of the

23 public agency action regardless of whether full compliance would have produced a different

24 result.

25 43. The City erred and abused its discretion in adopting the Categorical Exemptions

26 for the Project because the Project poses substantial adverse change to the Hollywoodland historic

27 resources. Under CEQA, a categorical exemption cannot not be used for a project which a may

28 cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource.

-8-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

44. The City further erred and abused its discretion in adopting the Categorical
Exemptions for the Project because the Project will degrade the existing visual character of the

3 Project site and its surroundings.

45. The City further erred and abused its discretion in adopting the Categorical

5 Exemptions for the Project because the cumulative impacts of the Project make a categorical |

6 exemption inappropriate.
46. The City further erred and abused its discretion in adopting the Categorical

8 Exemptions for the Project because the Project will significantly impact wildlife and wildlife

9 access.

10 47. The City further erred and abused its discretion in adopting the Categorical

11 Exemptions for the Project failed to consider all of the potential impacts previously identified by

12 the City for the Project site.

13 48. The City further erred and abused its discretion because the Project does not

14 qualify for a Class 32 a Categorical Exemption.

15 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

16 ERROR AND ABUSE

17 49. Petitioners repeat, reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation

18 contained in Paragraphs 1-48, inclusive, as though fully set forth herein.

19 50. In approving any discretionary project, the City has to proceed in accordance with

20 law, provide a fair hearing and support its decision with findings which are supported by

21 substantial evidence.

22 51. Here, the City's actions in approving the Project were arbitrary and capricious and

23 an abuse of discretion because, among other reasons, the City's findings are not supported by

24 substantial evidence.

25 52. Specifically, the City abused its discretion because its decision to approve the

26 Project was not supported by the findings, and the findings were not supported by the evidence.

27 53. Indeed, the CAPC specifically admitted that the Project failed to comply with the

28 "European Village" aesthetic required by the Specific Plan, but erroneously accepted the incorrect

-9-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 position of the Planning Department which claimed that the City could not deny the Project based

2 on non-conformity with the "European Village" aesthetic, but was bound by the "point system"
set forth in the Specific Plan. Such Planning Department advice was not only incorrect, it was
demonstrated to be incorrect by the introduction of previous projects denied in Hollywoodland

5 for failure to comply with the Specific Plan despite the fact that they met the requisite number of

6 "points." The CAPC failed to recognize the error.

WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment against Respondents and Real Parties, and
each of them, as follows:

10 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

11 1. That this Court issue an alternative and peremptory writ of mandate directing the

12 City and its departments to set aside and vacate the adopted Categorical Exemptions for the

13 Project;

14 2. That this Court issue an alternative and peremptory writ of mandate directing the

15 City and its departments to set aside and vacate all Project approvals which are based upon the

16 inadequate Categorical Exemptions;

17 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

18 3. That this Court issue an alternative and peremptory writ of mandate directing the

19 City to set aside its approval of the Project and reconsider the Project in light of the Court's

20 opinion and judgment;
ALL CAUSES OF ACTION

22 4. For a temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent injunctions

23 enjoining further construction and completion of the Project until this action can be decided on

24 the merits;

25 5. For costs of suit and attorneys' fees according to law, including Code of Civil

26 Procedure §1021.5; and
