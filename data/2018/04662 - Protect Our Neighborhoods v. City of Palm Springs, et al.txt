28| FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Prinied on Recyaled Papor

Petitioner, PROTECT OUR NEIGHBORHOODS, allege as follows:

2 INTRODUCTION

3 l. Petitioner PROTECT OUR NEIGHBORHOODS ("PON" or "Petitioner") brings

4 this action to invalidate the City of Palm Springs' unlawful issuance of the below-named Vacation

5 Rental Registration Certificates ("Certificates"). PON contends the City's issuance of the
6 challenged Certificates was an abuse of discretion because the Certificates were issued in violation

8 of the City's zoning code, which requires a land use or conditional use permit for commercial

businesses in residentially zoned neighborhoods. Additionally, PON contends the issuance of said

10 Certificates without any environmental review or adequate notice to residents was in violation of

11 CEQA.

12 II. THE PARTIES
13 2. Petitioner and Complainant, PON, is California non-profit membership
14
organization dedicated to the preservation and enhancement of residential neighborhoods in Palm
15

16 Springs. Since 2013 PON has urged the City of Palm Springs to adhere to the terms of the General

17 Plan and zoning code and protect the public health and welfare by managing the unchecked
18 proliferation of vacation rentals in Palm Springs. Members of PON work, reside, and recreate in
19 Palm Springs. PON brings this action on its own behalf, for its members, and in the public
20 interest.

21 3. Respondent and Defendant, City of Palm Springs ("City") is a local governmental
22

23 agency and subdivision of the State of California charged with authority to regulate and administer

24 land use and development within its territory in conformity with the provisions of the City's

25 General Plan, Municipal Code and all applicable provisions of state law, including the California
26| Environmental Quality Act, the Planning and Zoning law, and the Subdivision Map Act.

Prinied an Reeyoled Paper

4. Respondent and Defendant City Council of Palm Springs ("City Council") is the
2 legislative body and highest administrative body of the City. The City Council is ultimately
responsible for the City's land use policies and decisions, including the decision to abide the

operation of vacation rental businesses in single-family residential neighborhoods without any

5 CEQA review or any kind of land use permit.
6
5. The City Council and the City of Palm Springs, hereafter shall be collectively
7

8 referred to as the "City" or "Respondents".

6. Real Parties in Interest Scott Gaitan and Beverly Gaitan (Certificate City ID No.
10 297), James Sleighter and Karen Sleighter (Certificate City ID No. 3829), Jeffery Schneider and
11 Nancy Klemperer (Certificate City ID No. 1875), Michael Enenbach and Thomas Coggia

12 (Certificate City ID No. 3345), Dennis Potvin (Certificate City ID No. 2570), Joseph Ambrosavage
13 (Certificate City ID No.1101), Cheney Shapiro and Richard Williams (Certificate City ID No.
14 907), and Bobbie Sheets (Certificate City ID No. 3879) are the individual property owners whose 15

16 Certificates are being challenged.

17 7. Petitioner does not know the identity of DOES 1-25 or ROES 26-50 but will amend
18 the Petition as required to specifically identify each such person or entity a as a real party in interest
19 if the identity, interest and capacity of such party, if any, becomes known.
20 III. PROCEDURAL ALLEGATIONS
21 8. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant action
22

23 and has exhausted any and all administrative remedies to the extent required by law, by inter alia,

24 submitting written and oral comments on the issues that are the subject of this lawsuit.

25 9. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code ("Pub.

26 Res. Code") § 21167.5 by corresponding the commencement of this action to Respondents prior to

27

28 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Frinted on Reecled Poper

filing this petition and complaint.

2 10. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Pub. Res. Code § 21167.7 and
Code of Civil Procedure § 388 by mailing a copy of the Petition/Complaint to the state Attorney

4 General.

11. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law
6 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to rescind
7
Certificates issued without adequate environmental review of the impacts of the vacation rentals,
as required by CEQA, and not to approve any additional vacation rentals except pursuant to a 9

10 permit as required by the City's own zoning regulation and General Plan.

11 12. If Respondents are not compelled to rescind Certificates to vacation rentals issued
12| without adequate environmental review and a permit as required by the City's zoning code,
13 Petitioner will suffer irreparable harm from which there is no adequate remedy at law in that the
14 character of the neighborhoods in which these vacation rentals are located will be significantly and 15

16 permanently altered and disturbed on a potentially infinite basis, without any environmental review

17 as required by CEQA.

18 13. In pursuing this action, which involves enforcement of important rights affecting
19 the public interest, Petitioner will confer a substantial benefit on the general public and residents of
20 Palm Springs, and therefore will be entitled to attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to, inter alia,
21 Code of Civil Procedure §1021.5.
22
14.
23 Petitioner brings this action in part pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §1085 or

24 §1094.5, which require that an agency's approval of a Project be set aside if the agency has
25 prejudicially abused its discretion. Prejudicial abuse of discretion occurs either where an agency
26 has failed to proceed in a manner required by law or where its determination or decision is not

27

28 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Printod on Rocycled Faper

supported by substantial evidence. Respondents have prejudicially abused their discretion because

2 Respondents have failed to proceed according to the law, and their decision is not supported by

3l substantial evidence.

4 15. PON contends the City's approval of the Certificates referenced in this Petition was
unlawful because the City failed to undertake any environmental review as required by CEQA
6 prior to approving the Certificates. PON also seeks a judicial declaration indicating that the City's
7

8 approval of the Certificates in City's single-family residential neighborhoods is unlawful and in

9 violation of the City's zoning code, which does not specifically authorize the operation of vacation
10 rentals in single-family residential neighborhoods but does require a Land Use Permit or
11 Conditional Use Permit for any business that is similar to the business of vacation rentals.

12 Petitioner further seeks a judicial declaration indicating that the City's approval of vacation rentals
13 in condominiums violates the City's zoning code and is directly contradicted by the City's own
14
findings.
15

16 IV. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

17 16. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
18 §§ 1085 and 1094.5. Venue is proper in this Court because the action concerns the City of Palm
19 Springs, which is located in Riverside County.
20 V. STATEMENT OF FACTS
21 17. Chapter 5.25 of the Palm Springs Municipal Code (*PSMC"), otherwise referred to
22

23 as the "Vacation Rental Ordinance," governs vacation rentals within the City of Palm Springs.

24 18. The City amended the Vacation Rental Ordinance on April 2, 2014, through the
25 adoption of Ordinance No. 1848. In adopting this Resolution, the City Council declared that "use
26 single and multiple-family dwelling units for Vacation Rental lodging" . "in certain single-family

27

28 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF .5

Printed ou Rocyded Papor

neighborhoods may have effects that can best be addressed through an appropriate city regulatory

2 program." PSMC $5.25.00(a). The City further declared the purpose of the Vacation Rental

3 Ordinance (PSMC Ch. 5.25) to be the establishment of regulations for use of residential properties

4 for vacation rental purposes "thereby enabling the City to preserve the public health, safety and

5 welfare." PSMC $5.25.00(c).
6
19. Ordinance No. 1848 required owners of vacation rentals to obtain a valid
7

8 "Vacation Rental Registration Certificate." The requirements for obtaining such a Certificate,

9 however, are minimal. To obtain a Certificate, the registrant, which could be the owner, investor

10 or a management agency, was required to provide basic information, such as name, address and
11 phone number of the property owner or the owner's agent, name and contact information for a

12 local contact, information about the residential property such as number of bedrooms, a valid
13 a business license, a valid "transient occupancy registration" certificate, as well as any "other
14 information" deemed reasonably necessary by the City Manager. PSMC §5.25.060. 15

16 20. Ordinance No. 1848 included limits on the number of day-time and night-time

17 occupants based on the number of bedrooms. The Ordinance included other generic requirements

18 designed to make the owner/agent responsible for informing occupants about City regulations

19 concerning noise, trash, etc. It further required owners/agents to pay standard Transit Occupancy
20 Taxes ("TOT") at the same rate as any other small hotels or bed and breakfasts.
21 21. Significantly, Ordinance No. 1848 did not impose any limits on the number of days
22

23 any unit could be rented out, or the number of Vacation Rental units any person or corporation

24 could own in Palm Springs.

25 22. In response to the exponential growth of vacation rentals in Palm Springs, the City

26 adopted Urgency Ordinance No. 1891 to prohibit the conversion of apartments and condominiums

27

28 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 6 -

Prinled on Rocyded Papor

to vacation rentals. The City Council explained the need for this urgency ordinance by making the

2 following findings:

3 The City Council is "concerned regarding the potentially adverse impacts that the
conversion of rental apartment units to vacation rental uses may have on the City's
5 rental housing stock and resident socio-economic population mix."
6 "There is current and immediate threat to the public health, safety, and welfare 7

8 because conversions of apartment units to vacation rentals could displace
apartment residents and drive these residents out of Palm Springs, eroding the

10 City's resident socio-economic population mix but also adversely impacting City

11 business that rely on residents in that mix as a valuable employee pool."
12 The City reiterated that the use of single-family dwellings for Vacation Rental
13 lodging in single-family neighborhoods "may have effects that can be best be
14

15 addressed through an appropriate city regulatory program." 5.25.020(a).

16 The City determined that limiting vacation rentals to single-family neighborhoods

17 "will preserve and protect residential housing stock in the City"; however, the City

18 has not identified any substantial evidence to support this contention.
19 23. On July 13, 2016, the City extended Urgency Ordinance No. 1891 to November
20 2017. However, on October 18, 2016 the City adopted Ordinance No. 1902 to permanently codify
21

22 the prohibition against the conversion of apartments and condominiums to vacation rentals.

23 24. The City continued to debate and discuss the future of vacation rentals through

24 2016. The City Council conducted a Study Session on October 26, 2016 and a regular hearing on
25 November 30, 2016, to discuss and introduce a modification to the Vacation Rental Ordinance,

26

27

28 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Printed on Rooydled Puper

which included the creation of the Department of Vacation Rental Enforcement, modification of

2 user fees and registration guidelines.

25. The Staff Report for the November 30, 2016 City Council hearing explained that
the Vacation Rental Subcommittee had conducted several public meetings to identify goals and

objectives for the Vacation Rental Ordinance. The goals and objectives identified by the
6 Subcommittee include the following:
7

8 Short-term rentals are an ancillary use of residences for full and part-time

residents;

10 Short-term rentals are not a business for the benefit of investors or for real

11 estate speculation;

12 Priority goal is preserving our neighborhoods for full and part-time
13 residents;
14

15 Preserve and maintain long-term rental stock for workers, families and those

16 who cannot afford a down payment to buy a home;

17 Level the playing field between small hotels and vacation rentals and ensure

18 the health and safety of residents and tourists;
19 Reduce the use of short-term rentals as party houses for "weekend warriors."
20
26. The Staff Report stated that the number of vacation rentals in Palm Springs had 21

22 risen from 960 in 2009 to about 1,936 units in November 2016, plus an additional 175 pending

23 applications. The Staff Report also described the City's efforts to address the myriad of
24 complaints lodged by City residents about vacation rentals in single-family neighborhoods.

25 27. To address these concerns, goals and objectives, the Vacation Rental Subcommittee
26 recommended a series of amendments to the Vacation Rental Ordinance. In order to ensure
27

28 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 8.

Printed on Recycled Papar

Vacation Rentals are maintained only as an ancillary use for full or part-time residents, and not

2 managed a as a business venture, the Subcommittee recommended the following revisions to the

Vacation Rental Ordinance:

Vacation Rentals must be owned by a natural person or the trust of a natural

person

Individuals, family trusts, or limited liability companies can maintain
financial ownership interest in only a single vacation rental unit

Vacation rentals are to be permitted only through the owner--not through an

10 agency

11 28. To preserve single-family neighborhoods and level the playing field between small
12 hotels and Vacation Rentals, the Subcommittee recommended that the Vacation Rental Ordinance
13 be revised as follows:
14
Limit occupancy to two per bedroom 15

16 • Limit number of contracts per year to 28

17 29. The Subcommittee also recommended a number of additional measures to enhance
18 the City's ability regulate vacation rentals by
19 Increase fines for violations, which would be levied against permit holder
20
Annual inspections 21

22 Require 30-minute response time from permit holder, etc.

23 30. Significantly, the Subcommittee recommended that all existing multiple vacation
24 rental permit holders would be grandfathered only until January 1, 2021. The current Ordinance

25 grandfathered all existing units and does not include a sunset provision.
26

27

Printed un Recyeed Puper

31. To effectuate these goals and policies, the City adopted Ordinance 1907 which

2 amended and restated the City's Vacation Rental Ordinance. This Ordinance, while far from
3 perfect, included certain provisions that were at least intended to effectuate the City's stated goals

4 and objectives vis-à-vis regulation of vacation rentals. After years of denial, the City finally

5 admitted that vacation rental is a business:
6 Vacation Rentals are not uses specifically recognized in the City's Zoning
7 Ordinance, nor are these uses identified as uses permitted in single-family and

8 multi-family zones. Vacation Rentals and Homesharing are similar in characters and use as hotels and other commercial short-term uses and can only be permitted in single-family or multi-family zones if such uses are ancillary and secondary to
the residential use of the property. 5.25.020(a).
10
32. The City further concluded that:
11

12 Incidents involving excessive noise, disorderly conduct, vandalism, overcrowding, traffic congestion, parking congestion, and the accumulation of refuse, require
13 response from police, fire, paramedic, and other City services associated with this secondary, ancillary, commercial use escalates the demand for City services, creates
14 adverse impacts in residential areas of the City, and adversely affects the City's
residential neighborhoods. Vacation Rentals and Homesharing use in residential
15 neighborhoods may have effects that can best be addressed through an appropriate
16 city regulatory program. §5.25.020(b).

17 33. Ordinance No. 1907 included a number of provisions that were designed to ensure

18 vacation rentals were operated not as a business, but as ancillary to bona fide residential use of the
19 property. For example, the Ordinance prohibited the issuance of registration certificates to any
20 business entity other than a Limited Liability Company, or a natural person or a personal or family
21 trust. Moreover, the Ordinance prohibited any aforementioned entity from maintaining any
22
financial interest in more than a single Vacation Rental. §5.25.040(b). 23

24 34. The Ordinance granted current holders of financial interest in multiple Vacation

25 Rentals until January 1, 2021 to comply with the terms of §5.25.040(b).

26

27

35. §5.25.070(b) limited the number of times a property could be used a as a vacation

2 rental to 32 contracts per calendar year.

Challenge to and Repeal of Ordinance No. 1907

36. In response to the adoption of Ordinance No. 1907, the Vacation Rental Industry
5 hired a large public relations and political consultant to push back. A group called Citizens for a
Better Palm Springs ("CFBPS") was organized to lead the fight against the City's effort to adopt
7

8 modest restrictions on the operation of Vacation Rentals in Palm Springs. According to the Desert

9 Sun:

10 "Citizens for a Better Palm Springs" lists Jim Madaffer, principal of Madaffer Enterprises, as its chief officer, according to the California Form 410 filed with Palm Springs City Hall 11 on Dec. 12. Madaffer Enterprises is a public affairs and communications consulting firm

12 based in San Diego, which has listed HomeAway, the second largest (after AirBnb) national online listing site for vacation rentals, as a client during the recent debates on the
13 properties in Palm Springs.'
(http://www.desertsun.com/story/money/business/tourism/2017/01/03/petition-drive-aims-
14 send-palm-springs-vacation-rentals-restrictions-voters/96134186/.

15 37. CFBPS circulated a referendum petition whose stated purpose was for the City
16 Council to reconsider and repeal Ordinance No. 1907 or submit the Ordinance to the voters at the
17 next regular election scheduled for November 8, 2017.
18
38. At its February 15, 2017 City Council meeting, the City Clerk reported that it had
19

20 examined the referendum petition reported that the requisite 100% signature

21 verification/examination was performed. The Clerk reported that referendum proponents had
22 collected 2,880 valid signatures, which exceeded the minimum requirement to put the referendum

23 on the ballot.

24 39. Instead of submitting the referendum to the voters, consistent with Election Code
25 §9237 & §9241, the City elected to repeal Ordinance No. 1907 and to immediately adopt an
26
urgency ordinance. Unfortunately, the City Council was not able to adopt an urgency ordinance. 27

28 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 11 -

Frinied on Reuyeled Papes

While three members of the City Council voted to approve the urgency ordinance, it was

2 ultimately defeated because 4 out of 5 members of the City Council must agree to ratify an

3 urgency ordinance.

40. The Staff Report concerning the Urgency Vacation Rental Ordinance explained

5 that the Council's Subcommittee on Vacation Rentals "is concerned that the suspension of
Ordinance No. 1907 may create a vacuum where there may a be a flood of applications for vacation
7

8 rentals certificates without due regard for constrains and limits in the new, regulatory approach

9 41. The Urgency Ordinance would have grandfathered all existing Vacation Rentals,
10 including corporate-owned units or those owned by owners of multiple Vacation Rentals.

11 42. 'The Urgency Ordinance included a provision requiring Vacation Rentals in a so-
12 called Estate Home to obtain a Land Use Permit coupled with an administrative review process.
13 43. On March 15, 2017 the City Council adopted Ordinance No. 1918 which represents
14 the current policy for vacation rentals within the City and goes in to effect within 30 days. Notable 15

16 aspects of Ordinance No. 1918 include:

17 the grandfathering of all existing vacation rentals regardless of the character of

18 ownership;

19 the requirement that vacation rentals proposed in "Estate Homes"1 to obtain a
20 Limited Use Permit ("LUP"), prohibiting any business entity other than a
21

22 limited liability companies from running a vacation rental;

23 and limiting individuals, family trusts or limited liability company to

24 maintaining financial ownership in a single vacation rental unit.

25

26

27 Estate Home is defined as a single-family dwelling with five or more bedrooms.

28 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 12 -

Printed on Rocycled Papor

44. While the Ordinance requires vacation rentals to be use that is ancillary or
2 incidental to the residential use of the property, there Ordinance does not include any measures to
3  ensure the owner of the property establish he/she resides in the dwelling for any significant length
4  of time.

5 45. Significantly, Ordinance No. 1918 does not require non-Estate single-family

dwellings to obtain any type of permit and does not include any restrictions on the total number of 7

8 vacation rentals in any residential street or neighborhood. Nor did the City undertake any

9 environmental review of its vacation rental program in connection with the adoption of Ordinance

10 No. 1918. The new Ordinance does not include any meaningful restrictions on the location or
11 number of vacation rentals as a means to a protect the residential character of particular
12 neighborhoods; requires no environmental review for the approval of individual Vacation Rental
13 Certificates and was not subject to any meaningful environmental review of potential
14

15 environmental impacts of vacation rentals or potentially feasible mitigation measures and/or

16 alternatives.

17 46. By adopting Ordinance No 1918, the City Council now admits that vacation rental

18 is a commercial use that is not specified as an allowable use in the City's zoning code:

19 Vacation Rentals and Homesharing are not uses specifically recognized in the City's
20 Zoning Ordinance, nor are these uses expressly identified as uses permitted in single-family or multi-family zones. Vacation Rentals and Homesharing are similar
21 in character and use as hotels and other commercial short term uses and can only be permitted in single-family or multi-family zones if such uses are ancillary and
22 secondary to the residential use of property.

23 The City's zoning regulation of commercial use of residential properties
24 47. As the City's adoption of Ordinance No. 1907 and the text of the proposed Urgency
25 Vacation Rental Ordinance (which was ratified by 3 of the 5 City 5 Councilmembers) demonstrate, 26

27

28 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 13 •

Prinied on Rooyeled Paner

the City has finally stopped perpetuating the myth that Vacation Rentals are not a commercial

2 business.

3 48. According to the Palm Springs Municipal Code, only limited commercial uses are
4 allowed in a residential zone. Vacation Rentals are not a specified commercial use in PSMC

5 §92.01.01.
6
49. To the extent the PSMC does allow commercial uses in single-family
7

8 neighborhoods, it does so only subject to obtaining a specified permit. Under the City's Code, less

9 intense uses require a LUP (PSMC $92.01.01 (C)), while more intense uses, such as child care

10 centers; require a Conditional Use Permit ("CUP"). PSMC $92.01.01(D).

11 50. Palm Springs General Plan Policy HS1.8 directs the City to "Protect established
12 single-family residential neighborhoods from the transition, intensification, and encroachment of
13 uses that detract and/or change the character of the neighborhood." The City's own findings
14
demonstrate that the widespread conversion of residential dwellings to Vacation Rentals results in 15

16 intensification of use that can cause profound changes in the character of residential

17 neighborhoods.

18 51. On September 30, 2017 the City issued the following Certificates:

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Declaratory Relief)
52. PON refers to and incorporates herein by this reference all preceding paragraphs of
3
this Petition as though fully set forth herein. 4

5 53. The City has already declared that Vacation Rental is a commercial use,
6 functionally identical to small hotels and other short-term rentals, that is not a specified use in
7 residential neighborhoods, and should not be allowed except as a use that is ancillary to private
8 residential use of a single-family dwelling.
9 54. The City's vacation rental program allows for any individual or limited liability
10 companies to obtain a Vacation Rental Certificate without any type of land use permit or 11

12 environmental or other case-by-case review. Such hastily obtained Vacation Rental Certificates

13 may establish permanent vacation rentals without any limit on the number of vacation rentals in a
14 neighborhood or regard for inconsistency with or the impact on residential neighborhoods.

15 55. Even if Vacation Rentals were to be permitted in single-family residential
16 neighborhoods, the City's zoning ordinance requires all commercial uses in residential
17 neighborhoods to obtain either an LUP or CUP. Currently, the City has no regulation in place to
18

19 require an LUP or CUP for any proposed Vacation Rental in any single-family dwellings including

20 so-called Estate Homes.

21 56. PON further contends that the City's past and current practice of allowing absentee
22 owners and ownership of Vacation Rentals by limited liability companies, is inconsistent with and
23 violates the City's often-stated policy that Vacation Rentals "can only be permitted in single-
24 family or multi-family zones if such uses are ancillary and secondary to the residential use of
25 property."

28 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT ÖF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 15 -

Trinted on Recyeied Paper

57. Accordingly, an actual controversy exists between PON and the City of Palm

2 Springs. Petitioner and Plaintiff PON contends that the City cannot lawfully issue a Vacation
3 Rental Certificate for any proposed single-family dwelling or Estate Home except subject to an

4 LUP or CUP. PON further contends that the City's current regulatory scheme violates the City's
5 own stated policy of allowing Vacation Rentals in single-family or multi-family zones only if the
6 short-term rental is ancillary and secondary to the residential use of the property, as well as
7

8 General Plan Policy HS1.8 which directs the City to "Protect established single-family residential

9 neighborhoods from the transition, intensification, and encroachment of uses that detract and/or

10 change the character of the neighborhood."

11 WHEREFORE, PON prays for declaratory judgment against Respondents, as set forth
12 herein below.
13 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
14
(Violation of CEQA as to the named Certificates) 15

16 58. PON refers to and incorporates herein by this reference all preceding paragraphs of

17 this Petition as though fully set forth herein.

18 59. Approval of a Certificate amounts to a discretionary approval of a "project" within
19 the meaning of CEQA.
20 60. There is ample evidence in the record to show that each Vacation Rental Certificate
21 listed in Paragraph 51 above could potentially causes significant direct, indirect and cumulative
22

23 impacts on the human environment. As the City's own findings in support of the adoption of the

24 Ordinance admit, such impacts include but are not limited to impacts on noise, traffic and
25 circulation, vandalism, trash, etc. These impacts exceed similar impacts that would be caused by
26| private or long-term occupancy of single-family dwellings by long-term tenants or private owners.

61. The impacts associated with these Certificates tax the City's resources by requiring

2 additional police, paramedics, firefighters, trash, water, sewage, and other services.

62. Owing to the absence of any limits on the number of Vacation Rentals that can be

4 approved in any neighborhood, the cumulative impact of these Certificates in the same block or
5 neighborhood hub as existing vacation rentals can adversely impact the quality of life in the
6
neighborhood.
7
63.
8 Despite acknowledging the significant direct, indirect and cumulative impact of

9 Vacation Rentals on single-family neighborhoods and the City as a whole, the City has never
10 undertaken any adequate environmental review prior to issuing the listed Certificates.

11 WHEREFORE, PON prays for declaratory judgment against Respondents, as set forth

12 herein below.

13 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
14
(Violation of Zoning Law and the City's Municipal Code as to the named Certificates) 15

16 64. PON refers to and incorporates herein by this reference all preceding paragraphs of

17 this Petition as though fully set forth herein.

18 65. The City abused its discretion and violated its zoning code by not requiring the
19 vacation rentals listed in Paragraph 51 above to obtain a Land Use Permit. Under the City's zoning
20 code, a Land Use Permit is required for home occupations, small daycares, and other less intense
21 commercial uses in residential neighborhoods similar to vacation rentals.
22
66.
23 Under Ordinance No. 1918 the City can issue vacation rentals in neighborhoods

24 zoned for residential use. The vacation rentals, further, do not require the necessary permits for
25 such commercial uses in residential zones. With no numerical cap or any other restrictions, or
26 environmental review, the City violated its own General Plan mandate to protect the character of
27

Prinked on Rooyeled Paper

neighborhoods from the encroachment of uses that change the character of the neighborhood by
2 issuing the Certificates listed in Paragraph 51 above.
WHEREFORE, PON prays for declaratory judgment against Respondents, as set forth

herein below.

FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

(Abuse of discretion, violation of City Municipal Ordinance)
7
67.
8 PON refers to and incorporates herein by this reference all preceding paragraphs of

9 this Petition as though fully set forth herein.

10 68. The City's approval of the following Certificates was in violation of the City's
11 Code §5.25.030, which limits vacation rentals to single-family dwellings or condominium hotels

12 STREET ADDRESS CITY STATE ZIP City ID # TOT Permit #
13 11.11 E. Palm Canyon Drive Unit #125 Palm Springs |CA 92264 1101 6970
(1111 E. Palm Canyon Drive Unit #218 Palm Springs CA 92264 3879 4040
14 1111 E. Palm Canyon Drive Unit #217 Palm Springs CA 92262 908 6946

15 69. The City's Code §91.00.10, which defines condominium hotels as "a commercial
16 condominium project with units within a hotel or resort hotel that are individually owned." None
17 of the condominiums at issue here are within a hotel or resort hotel.

18 70. The City's approval of the above-referenced Certificates to condominiums that are
19
not within a "condominium hotel" directly contradicts the City's own definition of condominium 20

21 hotels and the City's stated purpose of protecting affordable, multi-unit residential housing stock.

22 71. To the extent the City claims it is long standing policy to issue vacation rental
23 certificates to condominium units, this policy directly contradicts its legislative acts and findings.

24 WHEREFORE, PON prays for judgment against the City of Palm Springs and Palm
25 Springs City Council, as set forth below:
26

27

28 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF . 18 -

Prined on Reoyeled Paper

1 a. A declaration that the City's issuance of the Vacation Rental Certificates

2 listed in Paragraph 51 above without any environmental review of the impacts, either

3 individually or cumulatively, on the City of Palm Springs is in violation of CEQA.

4 b. For declaratory judgment, stating the Vacation Rental Certificates issued in
Paragraph 51 above, violate the City's Municipal Code and zoning laws;

C. For declaratory judgment, stating that the Vacation Rental Certificates listed

8 in Paragraph 67 above issued to multi-family units, including condominiums, violates the
City's Municipal Code and zoning laws;

10 d. For Peremptory Writ of Mandate directing the City to set aside or otherwise

11 invalidate the Vacation Rental Certificates listed in paragraph 51 above;
12 e. For an award of costs and attorneys' fees pursuant to CCP §1021.5; and
13 f. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
