Plaintiff Save Berkeley's Neighborhoods alleges:

2 l. Education Code section 67504 provides that "The Legislature further finds and declares that the

4 expansion of campus enrollment and facilities may negatively affect the surrounding environment.
5 Consistent with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), it is the intent of

6 the Legislature that the University of California sufficiently mitigate significant off-campus impacts 7

8 related to campus growth and development."

9 Public Resources Code section 21080.09, subdivision (b) requires that "Environmental effects
10 relating to changes in enrollment levels shall be considered for each campus or medical center of public 11

12 higher education in the environmental impact report prepared for the long range development plan for

13 the campus or medical center." Public Resources Code section 21080.09, subdivision (d) requires that
14 Respondents and the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) "consider the environmental impact of 15

16 academic and enrollment plans" pursuant to CEQA and "that any such plans shall become effective for a

17 campus ... only after the environmental effects of those plans have been analyzed" as required by CEQA.
18 3. In 2005, Respondent Regents adopted a Long Range Development Plan (2020 LRDP) for UCB 19

20 to achieve a number of objectives through the year 2020, including stabilizing enrollment. In or about
21 2005, Respondent Regents certified a Final Environmental Impact Report for the 2020 LRDP (2005
22 EIR) pursuant to CEQA.
23

24 4. The 2020 LRDP is a discretionary project as defined in CEQA Guidelines, sections 15357 and
25 15378 and as provided in Public Resources Code section 21080.09. The 2020 LRDP is a "program"
26 type of CEQA project and the 2005 EIR is a "program EIR" as defined in CEQA Guidelines, section 27

28 15168(a)(1).

29 5. The 2020 LRDP project commenced immediately after its adoption in 2005. The 2020 LRDP
30 and 2005 EIR projected that by 2020 student enrollment at UCB would increase by 1,650 students, from
Law Offices of Thomas N. Lippe 201 Minaion 8t. 12'° Fioar SAn Francisce, CA P41DS - 1- Tet: 415-777-5604 PaN: 415-7775406
Third Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief (CEQA); Case No. RG18902751

1 the 2001-2002 two-semester average headcount of 31,800 to 33,450 students. This projected increase in
enrollment of 1,650 students was component of the 2020 LRDP's "project description," as this term is

4 used in CEQA. (See e.g., County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 193 ["An

5 accurate, stable and finite project description is the sine qua non of an informative and legally sufficient

EIR"].) The 2020 LRDP and 2005 EIR also projected that by 2020 UCB would add 2,500 beds for

8 students.

Beginning in or about 2007, Respondents made informal, discretionary decisions to change the
10 2020 LRDP project to increase enrollment at UCB over and above the 1,650 additional students
11

12 projected by the 2020 LRDP and disclosed in the 2005 EIR. Respondents effected these changes in the
13 2020 LRDP project "without a formal decision," as this phrase is used in Public Resources Code section
14 21167(a) and without public notice of this change. 15

16 7. Respondents have continued to make informal, discretionary decisions to change the 2020 LRDP
17 project by continuing to enroll more students, in virtually every two-semester period since 2007, than the
18 1,650 additional students projected by the 2020 LRDP and disclosed in the 2005 EIR. Respondents 19

20 have effected these continuing changes in the 2020 LRDP project without formal decisions and without
21 public notice.
22 8. 661 The 2005 EIR and 2020 LRDP indicate that UCB counts campus population in two ways: "by 23

24 actual headcounts and by full time equivalents, or FTE." According to the 2020 LRDP, "while budgets
25 are calculated in terms of FTE, for the purpose of environmental analysis actual headcount is the better
26 measure, since FTE tends to under-represent peak impacts. For example, two students taking six units 27

28 each are likely to have a greater impact than one student taking 12 units. The 2020 LRDP therefore uses
29 two-semester average headcount as the measure of campus population." (2020 LRDP, p. 14, Table 1.)
30 9. In March and April 2017, Plaintiff worked with City of Berkeley officials to determine the

1  current level of UCB enrollment in terms of "two-semester average headcount" because at that time
2 there was no publicly available enrollment information expressed in terms of "two-semester average
3

4 headcount" that could be used to compare current enrollment with the enrollment disclosed in the 2005

5 EIR. The City of Berkeley then sent a written request dated April 14, 2017, to Respondents requesting
6 the information. A true and correct copy of this letter is attached hereto as Exhibit 3. On October 30,
7

8 2017, Respondents sent to the City of Berkeley its response to the City's request for information. A true
9 and correct copy of this letter and its attachments is attached hereto as Exhibit 4. On or about October
10 31, 2017, the City of Berkeley provided Plaintiff with a copy of this response. 11

12 10. Respondents' October 30, 2017, letter to the City of Berkeley reveals that starting in about 2007
13 Respondent Regents and UCB changed the 2020 LRDP project by increasing enrollment at UCB over
14 and above the 1,650 additional students projected by the 2020 LRDP and disclosed in the 2005 EIR and 15

16 that since 2007 Respondents have continued to change the 2020 LRDP project by continuing to enroll
17 more students, in virtually every two-semester period, than the 1,650 additional students projected by the
18 2020 LRDP and disclosed in the 2005 EIR.
19

20 11. Plaintiff did not know and could not, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, have known of
21 Respondent Regents' and UCB's informal, discretionary decisions to increase student enrollment at
22 UCB above the increase of 1,650 students projected in the 2020 LRDP and disclosed in the 2005 EIR
23

24 until October 30, 2017, when Respondents responded to the City of Berkeley's request for information
25 regarding enrollment increases by providing to the City the document attached hereto as Exhibit 4.
26 12. The increase in student enrollment over and above the 1,650 additional students projected by the 27

28 2020 LRDP and disclosed in the 2005 EIR (hereinafter the "excess increase in student enrollment") has

29 caused and continues to cause significant adverse environmental impacts that were not analyzed in the
30 2005 EIR, including, without limitation, increased use of off-campus housing for and by UCB students,

1 leading to increases in off-campus noise and trash, and increased burdens on the City of Berkeley's
2 public safety services, including police, fire, ambulance, and Emergency Medical Technician services.
Plaintiff is also informed and believes and on that basis alleges that these impacts include, without
5 limitation, displacement of tenants resulting in more homeless individuals living on public streets and in
local parks; increases in the number of UCB students who are homeless; and increases in traffic and

8 transportation related congestion and safety risks.

9 13. Respondents have had and continue to have a legal obligation to analyze the environmental
10 effects of the excess increase in student enrollment pursuant to CEQA, including, without limitation, by 11

12 preparing and certifying an Environmental Impact Report to assess the significance of impacts caused by
13 the extraordinary increase in enrollment and to identify and adopt mitigation measures to reduce these
14 significant impacts.

Jurisdiction and Venue

4 22. Plaintiff brings this action in mandamus pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085,

1088.5, and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5; and as a complaint for
declaratory relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1060. The Court has jurisdiction over

8 these claims.

9 23. Venue is proper in Alameda County under Code of Civil Procedure section 394, subdivision (a),
10 because UCB and Respondents are situated therein.
11

12 Standing

13 24. Plaintiff and, to the extent applicable, its members are beneficially interested in Respondents'
14 full compliance with CEQA. Respondents owed a mandatory duty to comply with CEQA with respect 15

16 to the 2020 LRDP and the excess increase in student enrollment. Plaintiff has the right to enforce the
17 mandatory duties that CEQA imposes on Respondents.
18 Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies

20 25. UCB provides no administrative remedy for the legal claims or grounds of noncompliance with
21 CEQA alleged herein and Plaintiff had no opportunity to raise the grounds of noncompliance alleged
22 herein in any UCB administrative proceeding.

1 student enrollment.

2 28. Issuance of the relief requested herein will result in the enforcement of important rights affecting

excess increase in student enrollment under CEQA, Plaintiff will vindicate the public's important CEQA
rights to public disclosure regarding and public participation in government decisions that affect the

Il environment. 8

9 29. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement are such as to make an award of attorney's
10 fees appropriate in this proceeding because the transgressor is the agency whose duty it is to enforce the 11

12 laws at issue in this proceeding.

13 First Cause of Action

14 (Violation of CEQA: Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)

15 30. Plaintiff hereby realleges and incorporates the preceding paragraphs this First Amended Petition
16 and Complaint as though set forth herein in full.

18 31. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion in violation of CEQA pursuant to Public
19 Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5 and Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5 by
20 failing to subject the excess increase in student enrollment to the procedures and requirements of 21

23 without limitation, by failing to prepare and certify an Environmental Impact Report to assess the
24 significance of impacts caused by the excess increase in student enrollment; by failing to identify and 25

3  33. Plaintiff hereby realleges and incorporates the preceding paragraphs of this First Amended
4 Petition and Complaint as though set forth herein in full.
5

6 34. Since the 2007-2008 academic year, the Regents have implemented and continue to implement a
7 policy to increase student enrollment at UCB beyond the 1,650 additional students projected by the
8 2020 LRDP without subjecting the excess increase in student enrollment to the procedures and

10 requirements of CEQA; without analyzing the excess increase in student enrollment pursuant to CEQA,

11 and without preparing and certifying an Environmental Impact Report to assess the significance of
12 impacts caused by the excess increase in student enrollment; by failing to identify and adopt mitigation 13

14 measures to reduce these significant impacts; and by failing to make the findings required by Public

15 Resources Code section 21081 before carrying out the excess increase in enrollment.
16 35. Plaintiff has no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law and will
17

18 suffer irreparable injury unless this Court issues the relief requested herein. Plaintiff seeks a judicial
19 determination and declaration that Respondents' policy as described in paragraph 27 is unlawful because
20 it violates CEQA, including Public Resources Code section 210980.9, and Education Code section
21

22 67504.

23. 36. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between Plaintiff and Respondents. Plaintiff
24 contends that Respondents' policy as described in paragraph 27 is unlawful because it violates CEQA, 25

26 including Public Resources Code section 210980.9, and Education Code section 67504. Plaintiff is

27 informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that Respondents dispute these contentions.

Re: Notice of Intent to Sue Regarding Inadequate CEQA Review of UC Berkeley's 2020 Long Range Development Plan.
Dear Chancellor Christ and Regents of the University of California:
This office represents Save Berkeley's Neighborhoods with respect to the University of California at Berkeley's legal obligations to conduct environmental review of the 2020 Long Range Development Plan (2020 LRDP) in compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).

One of the 2020 LRDP's objectives is to stabilize enrollment. (2020 LRDP, Environmental Impact Report (2004 EIR), p. 3.1-10.) The 2004 EIR evaluated an increase in enrollment of 1,650
students above the 2001-02 two-semester average. (2004 EIR, p. 3.1-14.) The University's October 30, 2017, response to the City of Berkeley's request for information regarding enrollment increases shows an actual increase of 8.302 enrolled students above the 2001-02 two-semester average for the most recent two-semester period (i.e., Spring 2017 and Fall 2017). (Exhibit 1.) This represents a five-fold increase compared to the 2004 EIR's projection of a 1,650 student increase in enrollment.
This change in the project renders the 2004 EIR informationally defective because the EIR does not assess the impact of the actual increase in enrollment, which is orders of magnitude higher than the 1,650-student increase projected in the 2004 EIR. As a result, the University must prepare a supplemental or subsequent EIR to assess the significance of impacts caused by this extraordinary increase in enrollment and to identify and adopt mitigation measures to reduce these significant

impacts.

This letter provides notice pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.5 that on or before April 20, 2018, Save Berkeley's Neighborhoods intends to file a lawsuit challenging the University's adoption of the 2020 LRDP on grounds the adoption does not comply with CEQA.
Save Berkeley's Neighborhoods is willing to discuss settling this dispute without the need for litigation. At a minimum, any such settlement must include: (1) an enforceable agreement by the University to prepare and certify a new EIR to assess the impacts of the 2020 LRDP as its project description has changed to reflect the increases in enrollment shown in the University's October 30, 2017, response to the City's request for information; (2) the new EIR must use the same environmental baseline used in the 2004 EIR; and (3) tolling the statute of limitations so that Save Berkeley's Neighborhoods is not forced to file its lawsuit to protect against the statute of limitations.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Very Truly Yours,

13. Local Purchasing Program (Source: UC Berkeley Supplier Diversity Program - Supply Chain Management Office)
UC Berkeley strives to provide fair, open, and efficient opportunities for all suppliers interested in doing business with the campus. UC Berkeley's Supply Change Management office provides an overview of its practices here
(https://supplvchain.berkeley.edu/suppliers/doing-business-uc-berkeley).Over the years, the campus has made significant efforts to promote and support bidding by local business enterprises, especially Small Businesses, Women-owned Business Enterprises, Disadvantaged Business Enterprises, and Disabled Veteran Business Enterprises. Notably, the Supply Change Management office has conducted workshops for tocal businesses in partnership with local chambers of commerce and local business development organizations (https://supplychain.berkeley.edu/campus/supplier-diversity). These workshops provide an overview of the goods and services UC Berkeley procure each year; information needed to secure certifications (e.g., small, women, disadvantaged, veteran) that would make the business more competitive in our procurement system; and those of other public institutions (including UCSF) that report annual spend with these types of businesses.

UC Berkeley employs practices that support the procurement of goods and services from Berkeley local businesses and those with local headquarters in the city. Other reports and data can be provided on request that include differing levels of detail including number of businesses, spend and diversity information.

14. Employee Volunteer Release Time program for at-risk young people.

UC Berkeley does not have specific program for employees interested in volunteering with at-risk youth. Nonetheless, campus employees and students are involved in a wide variety of activities in the community and with underserved communities. The UC Berkeley Public Service Center outlines some of these opportunities and how affiliates can be involved on their website (http://publicservice.berkeley.edu/faculty-and-staff). The Public Service Center provides information to departments for one-time events, as well as offering VolunteerMatch for individuals looking for volunteer opportunities. Community groups (http://publicservice.berkeley.edu/communitv)can also engage directly with the campus, including submitting information to publicservice@berkeley.edu, posting opportunities on VolunteerMatch, recruiting student volunteers/researchers, and participating in the Chancellor's Community Partnership Fund.
