21 Under California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and/or 1094.5 and California
22 Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq., Golden State Environmental Justice Alliance
23 (Petitioners) sue on their own behalves, and on behalf of other neighbors of proposed 1020 S.
24 Figueroa project (hereafter, "the Project"), and on behalf of the general public to enforce the
25 California Environmental Quality Act, and allege:
26 INTRODUCTION
27 1. This action challenges the approval by the City Council of the City of Los
28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) P

1 Angeles, with associated California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") documents, of the
2 1020 S. Figueroa project ("the Project"). The Project would be a 48-story residential tower with
3 435 residential units and a 430-foot, 29-story hotel tower with 300 rooms and 36,580 square feet
4 of ancillary uses. Both structures would be on podiums; the podium for the residential tower
5 would be 55 feet in height; the podium below the hotel would apparently be 75 feet. The
6 podiums would contain 55,499 square feet of retail, restaurant and other commercial use space.
7 The buildings would contain 860,121 square feet of use, and a four-level subterranean parking

garage with 738 parking spaces, apparently the minimum under City code.

2. Petitioners seek to set aside these approvals:
10
a. City Council File Numbers 17-1009-S1 and -S2, adopting the
11 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") and Errata, and Planning and Land Use Management
12 Committee Reports,
13
b. An Ordinance of unknown number adopting a Development Agreement for the
14
Project,
15
C, Any motions purporting to adopt findings and certify an EIR for the Project,
16 including any Statement of Overriding Considerations and any Mitigation Monitoring and
17 Reporting Plan for the Project,
18
d. Approvals of the Los Angeles City Planning Commission's
19 i. Certification of the EIR and Errata, ENV-2015-1159-EIR, State
20 Clearinghouse No. 2016021013, and adoption of the associated findings and Mitigation
21 Monitoring Program,
22 ii. Approval and recommendation that the City Council adopt the
23 Development Agreement for the Project,
24 iii. Approval and recommendation that the City Council adopt the
25 Development Agreement by Ordinance, and
26 iv. Findings.
27
3.
28 On information and belief, a Notice of Determination for the Project was posted

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 2

1 on or after December 12, 2017.
2
4.
3 The City Council is the ultimate land-use authority and decisionmaking body in
the City of Los Angeles, although in this case it purported to delegate its authority to a Deputy

5 Advisor on the Planning Department Staff (who originally purported to certify the EIR), and then

6 to the Planning Commission (which then purported to certify the EIR), and then also to the

7 PLUM Committee. Petitioner alleges these delegations were unlawful, particularly given that
the City Council had the sole authority to adopt the Development Agreement.
8
5.
9 In approving the Project, the City and City Council violated provisions of CEQA

10 requiring that a lead agency fully assess and disclose significant impacts and that it provide

11 reliable mitigation subject to specific performance standards such that project's impacts will be
mitigated to the fullest extent feasible.
12
6.
13 Air Quality: Health Risk Assessment. The City and City Council approved the

14 Project without adequately characterizing the health risks from construction and operation due to

15 the presence of diesel particulate matter ("DPM"), a Toxic Air Contaminant. Briefly put, both

16 the construction and operation of the Project would involve diesel powered trucks, and the

17 construction of the Project would involve diesel-powered construction equipment as well. And

18 there are residences close to the proposed Project, therefore, there are health risks from the DPM.

7. The City conceded that it had to a do a quantified health risk assessment ("HRA")
19

20 for the construction phase of the Project, but it failed to conduct such a study under South Coast

21 Air Quality Management District ("SCAQMD") guidance regarding the proper "fraction of time
at home" ("FAH") for the 0-2 and 2-16 age groups.
22 7. Further, the City failed to assess operational health impacts to nearby sensitive
23

24 receptors from DPM from trucks visiting due to the operation of the Project. Petitioners

25 submitted a study (the "Health Risk Screening Assessment") from qualified experts

26 demonstrating that operation of the Project alone could have an overall health risk impact on
children of 330 cancers in a million, well over the standard of 10 cancers in a million a that the
27

28 South Coast Air Quality Management District ("SCAQMD") finds significant. Petitioners' study

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 3

F4 further concluded that the risk to adults at 25 meters from the Project would be 61.5 in a million,
2 and that overall cancer risk would be 392 in a million. The City failed to respond to Petitioner's
3
study.
4
7. Even if there were uncertainties in Petitioners' Health Risk Screening
5 Assessment, it easily demonstrated that the combined effects of construction and operation on
nearby sensitive receptors could exceed the 10 in a million SCAQMD threshold. Respondents
should have, but did not, provide a quantified analysis of construction and operation emissions
together. Further, their "qualitative" analysis of operational emissions was an abuse of discretion
and was not based on substantial evidence and represented a failure to proceed by law under
10 CEQA based on governing rules within the jurisdiction. Additionally, Respondents did not
11 include a mitigation measure
12
8. Greenhouse Gas Assessment. The City and City Council further failed to engage
13 in the necessary analysis of greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions required under CEQA. The City
14 merely assessed compliance with the LA Green Plan and the Sustainable City Plan, and this
15 violated both the guidance of the California Supreme Court in Center for Biological Diversity v.
16 Dept. of Fish & Wildlife (2015) 62 Cal. 4th 204 and CEQA Guidelines section 15064.4(b).
17 Additionally, the City's assessment of compliance with those Plans was erroneous. The City
18 further failed to assess compliance with SB 32, or Executive Orders B-30-15 and S-3-05,
19 contrary to the Supreme Court's conclusion that such an assessment was appropriate in
20 Cleveland National Forest Found. V. San Diego Ass'n of Governments (2017) 3 Cal. 5th 497,
21 510.
22
9. Noise. The City underestimated impacts to some sensitive receptors of
23 construction noise from the Project (to those along 11th it Street), and it failed to adequately
24 mitigate for those impacts.
25
10. Light and Glare. First, Respondents claimed that they did not have to analyze
26 light and glare impacts based on an administrative issuance by someone its Planning Department
27 concluding that Public Resources Code section 21099 eliminated any requirement that the City
28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA)

P analyze aesthetic impacts under CEQA. However, the City had issued a threshold in Los
2 Angeles Municipal Code Chapter 9, section 93.0117 which provides that "no exterior light may
c cause more than two foot candles of lighting intensity or generate direct glare onto exterior
4 glazed windows or glass doors on any property containing residential units; elevated habitable
porch, deck, or balcony." This, and the L..A. CEQA Thresholds Guide, had to be considered as a
6 "thresholds of significance that are more protective of the environment," under Pub. Res. Code
7 Section 21099(e), and the City therefore had no basis for disregarding it. Second, the City
8 baselessly claimed that a less stringent provision of the Municipal Code, Planning and Zoning
9 Code section 14.4.4.E, overrode the more stringent provision, allowing for three foot candles of
10 light at the property line of the nearest residentially zoned property.2 Third, the City in the DEIR
11 used an excessively lenient threshold which was not based upon either the L.A. CEQA
12 Thresholds Guide or Appendix G of the State CEQA Guidelines.' For all three reasons, the
13 City's conclusion must be invalidated under CEQA.
14 JURISDICTION AND VENUE
15 11. This Court has jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and
16 1094.5. The Court has jurisdiction of CEQA matters under Pub. Resources Code sections 21168,
17 21168.5, and 21168.9.
18
12. Venue is proper in this Court because the City of Los Angeles and the proposed
19

20 The Thresholds Guide provides that the determination of significance with respect to light
21 and glare shall be made case-by-case, considering (1) the change in ambient illumination a levels as a result of project sources, and (2) the extent to which project lighting would spill
22 off the project site and affect adjacent light-sensitive areas.
2
23 There were at least three residential locations, at 717 West Olympic Blvd., 650 West 11th Street, and Olympic Tower South Elevation at Residential balconies and units, where
24 residential properties would be exposed to more than two footcandles under at least one of the alternatives, and the Project as modified with the FEIR retained signage facing these
25 properties.
3 The standard the City used to review light and glare impacts was whether the Project
26 "Includes lighting or glare that would substantially alter the character of the off-site areas surrounding the project site, or result in substantial light spill/or glare onto adjacent light-
27 sensitive receptors." Neither the City's Thresholds Guide nor Guidelines Appendix G required a "*substantial" impact off-site.

21. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that each of the Real
10 Parties gave consent to, ratified or authorized the acts alleged, and that each of the Real Parties
11 knowingly aided, abetted or conspired with the others to commit the acts alleged herein.
12 STATEMENT OF FACTS AND COMMON ALLEGATIONS
13
22. The Project Site and Proposed Project. The Project site is most of a city block
14 bounded by South Figueroa Street, West Olympic Boulevard, West 11th Street, and South Flower
15 Street. The site excludes the northeast corner of the block consisting of the Petroleum Building,
16 EI Cholo Restaurant, and a parking lot between them. The L-shaped site covers approximately
17 2.7 acres, and faces the LA Live! complex along South Figueroa, but existing and planned
18 residential development along West Olympic and West 11th Street. The Project Site is currently
19 occupied by the Luxe Hotel, a 112,748 square foot, nine story, 100 foot tall building that
20

21 includes 178 guest rooms, a main lobby, meeting rooms, an interior restaurant, an indoor/outdoor
bar and lounge area (Nixon Bar and Lounge), a fitness center, and a one-level parking deck with
22 parking below and above the deck.
23 23. The original proposed project in the draft Environmental Impact Report ("DEIR")
24 involved the development of a hotel tower and two residential towers totaling 1,129,284 square
25 feet; in the final Environmental Impact Report ("FEIR") the City modified its proposal to only
26

27 plan for the hotel tower with one residential tower, although it planned to fit more units into that
one tower (with 48 floors instead of 38 as proposed in the original project), such that the overall
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 7

1

2 number of residential units would only be reduced from 650 to 435 despite the loss of one tower.

3 The FEIR proposed to reduce the overall digital signage from 60,000 square feet to a mere a
21,200 feet, although it continued to rely on the Lighting Study prepared for the original project.
4 The FEIR conceded that the revised project would involve more construction days for the
5 excavation of the subterranean parking for both Phases 1 (construction of the new hotel, its
6 podium, retail uses and terraces) and 2 (demolition of the Luxe Hotel, construction of the
7 residential tower and retail uses and podium terraces). The FEIR's "Modified Design
Alternative," which became the proposed project the City approved, is referred to herein as the
Project.
10 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
11 Failure to Analyze All Potentially Significant Impacts; Findings Not Based on Substantial
12 Evidence
13

14 [CEQA, Pub. Res. Code §§ 21000 et seq.]

24. Petitioners reincorporate and reallege paragraphs 1 through 23 as if fully set forth.
15 25.
16 CEQA requires that a lead agency identify all potentially significant impacts of a
project. It further requires that the lead agency's findings must be based on substantial evidence.
17 Pub. Resources Code § 21082.2. As to those significant impacts, the lead agency must take all
18 feasible steps to mitigate them or to develop alternatives, and if those impacts remain significant,
19

20 the agency must adopt a statement of overriding considerations.
26. The DEIR failed to fully analyze significant impacts to air quality (in terms of
21 health risks), GHGs, noise, light and glare, as discussed above. The City failed to make findings
22 of significance, it failed to it impose mitigation measures or adopt alternatives, and it failed to
23 adopt a statement of overriding considerations based on substantial evidence as to those impacts.
24 27. The City's findings lacked a substantial evidence basis and represented a failure
25 to proceed by law as required by CEQA.
26

27

28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 8

1 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
2 Failure to Include All Critical Information in the DEIR
3 [CEQA, Pub. Res. Code § 21000 et seq.]
4
28. Petitioners reincorporate and reallege paragraphs through 27 as if fully set forth.

29. The DEIR failed to include critical information in the document itself, burying
6 key elements in Appendices or leaving it out entirely it in violation of established precedent, in
7 violation of CEQA. Material that should have been included consisted of, among other things,
8 the tables in the Lighting Study disclosing that residences would experience more than two
9 footcandles of illuminance because of the original project or the Project.
10 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
11 Failure to Adequately Mitigate All Potentially Significant Impacts: Findings Not Based on
12 Substantial Evidence
13 [CEQA, Pub. Res. Code §§ 21000 et seq.]
14
30. Petitioners reincorporate and reallege paragraphs 1 through 29 as if fully set forth.
15 31. CEQA requires an agency to adopt feasible mitigation measures that will
16 substantially lessen or avoid the project's potentially significant impacts and to describe those
17 mitigation measures in the DEIR and in a Mitigation Monitoring & Reporting Program to be
18 adopted by the agency with the certification of the EIR.
19
32. A lead agency must impose all feasible mitigation measures to reduce impacts to
20 less than significant levels. And a lead agency's findings that it has imposed all feasible
21 mitigation measures must be supported by substantial evidence.
22 33. The City failed to adequately mitigate for multiple impacts. For example, without
23 limitation, regarding air quality, the City failed to require that Phases 1 and 2 not go forward
24 concomitantly, although it had reviewed health risks to adjacent sensitive receptors as if this
25 would be the case. Further, regarding GHGs, the City failed to impose several requirements
26 from the Green LA Plan and the Sustainable City pLAn, even though compliance with these
27 Plans was the only metric the City used to assess compliance with AB 32 (and SB 32 and
28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 9

Executive Orders B-30-15 and S-3-05).
2 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
3 Findings Not Based on Substantial Evidence
4 [CEQA, Pub. Res. Code § 21000 et seq.]
5
34. Petitioners reincorporate and reallege paragraphs 1 through 33 as if fully set forth.
6
35. CEQA requires that an agency must adopt findings that support its conclusions on
7 its review of an EIR. Those findings must be based on substantial evidence in the whole record.
8
36. The City's conclusion that the impacts in the areas of air quality (based on the
, inadequate HRA), greenhouse gas emissions, noise, light and glare were not significant was not
10 based on substantial evidence and represented a failure to proceed by law.
11 37. The City's conclusion that the specific overriding considerations it identified to
12 justify significant impacts on construction noise and historical resources would materialize, and
13 that they justified the Project despite its significant impacts, were not based on substantial
14 evidence.
15 38. The City's finding it had mitigated all significant impacts to the fullest extent
16 feasible was not based on substantial evidence.
17 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION
18 Inadequate Alternatives Analysis
19 [CEQA, Pub. Res. Code § 21000 et seq.]
20 56. Petitioners reincorporate and reallege paragraphs 1 through 55 as if fully set forth.
21 57. CEQA and the Guidelines require that a DEIR identify and discuss alternatives to
22 a proposed project, and that it identify the impacts within each impact area for a given a
23 alternative.
24 58. The DEIR failed to address a reasonable range of alternatives, failed to address
25 any possible alternative sites, and failed to adequately assess the alternatives it did discuss.
26
59. The DEIR's findings in this regard were entirely absent or were not based on
27 substantial evidence and represented a failure to a proceed by law.
28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 10

WHEREFORE, Petitioners and Plaintiffs pray
2 1. For the Court's peremptory writ of mandate requiring the City to set aside its 3 decision approving the EIR for the Project (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168, 21168.5,
