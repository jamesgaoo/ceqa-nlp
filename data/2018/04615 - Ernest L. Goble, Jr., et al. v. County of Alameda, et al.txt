4 to consider the FIRST APPEAL, and said panel rejected and denied the FIRST APPEAL,
5 thereby uphold the CDA's selection of REAL PARTY's application for approval, which
6 thus resulted in approval of said application for the SUBJECT PERMIT
7 ("ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION"). Among other things, the COUNTY'S
8 administrative appeals panel failed to adequately consider, make determinations or

9 findings regarding, or decide all of the grounds/objections raised in the FIRST APPEAL.
10 14. On or about February 7, 2018, the director of the CDA issued a notice of
11 the ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION rejecting or denying the FIRST APPEAL, and
12 upholding and approving the selection of REAL PARTY's application for issuance of the

4 19. As set forth further below, PETITIONERS allege that RESPONDENTS
5 including by their initial review of and final selection of REAL PARTY's application for
6 the SUBJECT PERMIT, handling, review, and denials of PETITIONERS' APPEALS,

7 and issuance of the SUBJECT PERMIT to REAL PARTY - proceeded without and in
8 excess of their jurisdiction, acted arbitrarily, capriciously, irrationally, and without
9  substantial evidence, failed to lawfully carry out, perform, or comply with their
10 mandatory and/or ministerial duties, prejudicially abused their discretion, and failed to
11 proceed in the manner required by law.

12 20. The BOARD's above-noted decision to deny or reject the SECOND

1 25. PETITIONERS further allege that by upholding the ADMINISTRATIVE

2 DECISION and issuing the SUBJECT PERMIT to REAL PARTY, RESPONDENTS
3 abused their discretion and acted in excess of their respective jurisdiction, violated the
4 law, and abused their discretion, including for example and without limitation, in the

5 following respects:

6 (a) REAL PARTY's proposed medical cannabis dispensary purportedly
7 authorized by the SUBJECT PERMIT is a prohibited commercial operation on the

8 SUBJECT PARCEL zoned "A Agricultural" in the unincorporated area of
9 Alameda County, in violation of voter-approved Measure D, the Save Agriculture
10 and Open Space Lands Initiative;
11 (b) The SUBJECT PERMIT violates the requirements in COUNTY's
12 own laws, including Ordinance No. 2017-34, for a medical cannabis dispensary,
13 including because the location for and siting of the proposed dispensary do not
14 comply with all of COUNTY's zoning and land use requirements, including that
15 "no dispensary shall be located in a residential zone or its equivalent"; and
16 (c) RESPONDENTS improperly failed to consider all of the bases or
17 grounds in the APPEALS of COUNTY's issuance of the SUBJECT PERMIT, and

18 failed to conduct any review of, or allow any public review and comment
19 regarding, the proposed dispensary's potentially significant environmental effects

2 properties affected by RESPONDENTS' actions and failures are located in the County of

3 Alameda.

4 STATEMENT OF ADDITIONAL FACTS

5 A. Measure D - The Save Agriculture and Open Space Lands Initiative

6 28. On November 7, 2000, the voters of Alameda County passed Measure D,
7 the Save Agriculture and Open Space Lands Initiative, to preserve and enhance
8 agriculture and agricultural lands, and to protect the natural qualities, the wildlife

9 habitats, the watersheds and the beautiful open spaces in the unincorporated portions of
10 Alameda County from excessive, badly located, and harmful development.
11 29. Measure D amended COUNTY's General Plan, including the so-called East
12 County Area Plan ("ECAP") portion of same that was previously adopted by the BOARD
13 on May 5, 1994.
14 30. The ECAP sets forth the land use designations and their allowable uses for
15 the region, and Measure D prohibits in the unincorporated area of the County uses not
16 specifically allowed or permitted in the text of the ECAP.

17 31. Measure D also re-drew portions of the aforementioned UGB (in the
18 ECAP), which is designed to protect the remaining open space and agricultural lands in
19 eastern Alameda County, by ensuring urban type development can only be approved
20 inside the UGB. (ECAP, Policy 1, p. 7.)
21 32. Measure D designated and proscribed the allowable uses for the land in the
22 unincorporated portion of Alameda County, including the SUBJECT PROPERTY.
Law Offices of 23 33.
GAGEN. Measure D also added Policy 54 to the ECAP, providing that COUNTY
McCOY, McMAHON, 24 shall only approve open space, park, recreational, agricultural, limited infrastructure, KOSS,
MARKOWITZ & FANUCCI 25 public facilities and other similar and compatible uses outside the UGB in order to protect A Professional
Corporation 630 San Ramon 26 regionally significant open space and agricultural land from development. Valley Blvd.,
Suite 100
P.O. Box 218 27 34.
Danville, CA Regarding the land use designations governing and regulating land use
94526 (925) 837-0585 28 densities, intensities, and permitted uses in the East County area, the ECAP specifically
-7-
COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
FACLDAM,54535\Pleadings \Sunol Ranch LLC Complaint-PWM 5-25-18.docx

states the goal is "to clearly delineate areas suitable for urban development and open

2 space areas for long-term protection of natural resources, agriculture, and public safety."
3 (ECAP, p. 7.) Furthermore, given the ECAP's and Measure D's level of detail regarding

4 land use designations and permitted uses, and particularly Measure D's enactment by the
5 County's voters as a local initiative, these land use regulations must reasonably be
6 interpreted as prohibiting any uses not specifically listed or included.

7 35. Indeed, in recently adopting the below-noted County Dispensary
8 Ordinance, RESPONDENTS confirmed that "[i]n adopting the [ECAP] in 1994 and

9 Measure D in 2000, the Board of Supervisors and the voters established an urban growth
10 boundary and associated goals and policies to protect agricultural and open space uses
11 while allowing some limited development, including 'agricultural enhancing commercial
12 uses' that can demonstrate an economic connection to agricultural use and production and
13 'visitor-serving commercial uses' that promote agriculture and are subordinate and
14 directly related to the area's agricultural production." (Emphasis added; County
15 Dispensary Ordinance (Ord. No. 2017- 34), Section 1, Finding 19.)
16 36. Measure D and the ECAP define "agricultural enhancing commercial use"
17 as "stables, fruit stands, feed stores, sampling rooms, bed and breakfasts, and other uses
18 which can demonstrate an economic connection to agricultural use or production."
19 (ECAP, Table 1, Definitions.) Thus, agricultural enhancing uses are those directly related
20 to the region's agricultural production, to both draw visitors and enhance the commercial
21 viability of the underlying agricultural production.

22 37. REAL PARTY's proposed dispensary has no such ties. There is no direct

Law Offices of
GAGEN. 23 relationship whatsoever between it or its retail cannabis products, and any potential

Corporation 630 San Ramon 26 38.
Valley Blvd., Rather, REAL PARTY's proposed dispensary is more akin to an ordinary

F:CLDAM,54535\Pleadings\Sunol Ranch LLC Complaint-PWM 5-25-18.docx

1 items of "agricultural" origin/production, a supermarket located amidst cropland cannot
2 be said to enhance the viability of the surrounding agricultural operations. In sum, rather
3 enhancing any surrounding agricultural production (of cannabis, or otherwise), REAL
4 PARTY'S proposed dispensary is merely a retailer of goods grown and processed
5 elsewhere, far and wide.

6 39. Similarly, Measure D and the ECAP define visitor-servicing commercial
7 uses as "limited to facilities that promote agriculture and are subordinate and directly
8 related to the area's agricultural production." (Emphasis added; ECAP, Policy 81, p. 23.)

9 The listed examples are wineries, inns, and food and beverage stores. (ld.) As criteria,
10 Policy 83 further notes the "project will primarily promote agricultural products grown or
11 processed in Alameda County." (ECAP, p. 23.)

12 40. Most importantly, Measure D and the ECAP clearly provide that any
13 subsequently adopted plan, zoning, regulation, ordinance, resolution, or policy adopted
14 by the BOARD is ineffective to the extent it is inconsistent with the ECAP, as amended by
15 Measure D.

16 41. In sum, this action challenges RESPONDENTS' wholly unsupported,
17 improper, and illegal efforts to circumvent, dilute, and essentially gut, the voter-approved
18 initiative known as Measure D. Compared to legislative actions by elected officials,
19 voter-approved initiatives are imbued with particularly strong, constitutionally-derived
20 importance. The California Constitution distributes between the People of California and
21 their elected representatives the power to make law. Article IV, Section 1 states, "[t]he
22 legislative power of this State is vested in the California Legislature... but the people
Law Offices of 23 reserve to themselves the powers of initiative and referendum." The "powers of initiative GAGEN,
McCOY, McMAHON, 24 and referendum" are defined in Article II, Sections 8, 9 and 10 with respect to statewide KOSS.
MARKOWITZ & FANUCCI' 25 measures. A different section of the Constitution describes the powers of initiative and A Professional
Corporation 630 San Ramon 26 referendum regarding cities and counties. Thus, Article II, Section 11 states, "Initiative Valley Blvd.,
Suite 100 P.O. Box 218 27 Danville, CA and referendum powers may be exercised by the electors of each city or county under

Coalition v. City of Upland (2017) 3 Cal.5th 924 ("California Cannabis"), involving
2 whether the People's initiative powers can be limited by implication, our Supreme Court
3 emphasized the importance of said reserved right:

4

5 Without an unambiguous indication that a provision's purpose was to constrain the initiative power, we will not construe it to impose such

6 limitations.... The concurring and dissenting opinion queries "by what

N authority" we require clear evidence of an intended purpose to constrain exercise of the initiative power. (Conc. & dis. opn., post, at p. 957.) Our
co answer is rooted firmly in the long-standing and consistent line of cases

a emphasizing courts' obligation to protect and liberally construe the initiative power (e.g., Associated Home Builders, supra, 18 Cal.3d at p.

10 591) and to narrowly construe provisions that would burden or limit its
exercise (see, e.g., Rossi, supra, 9 Cal.4th at p. 696). Those cases

11 underscore the centrality of direct democracy in the California

12 Constitution, and the status of our presumption liberally construing the initiative power as paramount structural element of our

13 Constitution. (E.g., Associated Home Builders, at p. 591 [describing the

14 initiative as "one of the most precious rights of our democratic process'].) A clear statement rule is consistent with, and indeed,

15 appropriately advances our duty to safeguard the exercise of the initiative power. Although limits may be placed on it, and in some cases
16 they have been, the best way to implement our oft-repeated references to

17 the importance of the initiative is to avoid presuming that a provision constrains that power without a clear statement or equivalent evidence

1 of up to a certain number of permits, purportedly allowing or authorizing the
2 establishment and operation of medical cannabis dispensaries somewhere in the relatively

4 Dispensary Ordinance purported to possibly, perhaps, and conditionally (as noted above)
5 issue up to two (2) such dispensary permits within the unincorporated areas known or

11 (a) outlines a process for selecting applicants to be issued permits by
12 COUNTY to operate medical cannabis dispensaries in the unincorporated portions

14 (b) requires applicants to provide the address of the proposed medical

51. Additionally, Measure D, the Save Agriculture and Open Space Lands
2 Initiative, prohibits commercial operations (regulated by the Medicinal and Adult-Use
3 Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act, or "MAUCRSA." (SB 94, 2017 Session)), and those
4 without direct ties to agricultural production or cultivation, including REAL PARTY's
5 proposed dispensary on or at the SUBJECT PARCEL.

6 52. Cannabis cultivation is not part of the agriculture, or agricultural history, in
7 unincorporated Alameda County where the SUBJECT PROPERTY is located.

8 53. The subject dispensary purportedly authorized by the SUBJECT PERMIT
9 does not qualify as an "agricultural support service use", i.e., that primarily supports
10 Alameda County agriculture, is not detrimental to existing or potential agricultural uses,
11 demonstrates an adequate and reliable water supply, and complies with other policies and
12 programs of Measure D.

13 54. Additionally, RESPONDENTS have not established any development
14 standards or procedures governing "agricultural support service" uses.
15 55. The subject dispensary purportedly authorized by the SUBJECT PERMIT
16 also fails to qualify as a "limited agriculture enhancing commercial use", i.e., that

17 primarily supports agricultural production in the unincorporated portion of Alameda
18 County where the SUBJECT PROPERTY is located.

19 56. Nor is the dispensary an allowable stable, fruit stand, feed store, sampling

59. Nor is the proposed dispensary a winery a or food and beverage store, that
2 promotes agriculture and is subordinate or directly related to the agricultural use or
production in unincorporated Alameda County at or near the SUBEJCT PROPERTY.

4 60. Likewise, RESPONDENTS have not established any development
standards or procedures for "visitor serving commercial uses".
61. Notably, the BOARD's findings purportedly supporting adoption of the

7 above-noted County Dispensary Ordinance state, "the Board... has determined that, with
8 appropriate conditions, a dispensary may be an appropriate conditionally permitted use in
9 the agricultural district and outside of the urban growth boundary established by Measure
10 D as an 'agriculture enhancing commercial use' and a 'visitor-serving commercial use' that
11 is economically related to and supports the area's cannabis cultivation." (Emphasis
12 added; Ord. No. 2017-34, Section 1, Finding 20, p. 3.) However, COUNTY failed then,
13 and fails now, to identify any cannabis cultivation, and more importantly, to articulate
14 under what circumstances, or general or specific conditions, any cannabis dispensary can
15 purportedly be "made consistent" with Measure D or the ECAP. Absent perhaps
16 requiring a dispensary to be on the same site as, or immediately adjacent and tied to,a
17 cannabis cultivation operation or facility which, incidentally, based on both recent
18 history and practice, not to mention common sense and RESPONDENTS' Own
19 County Dispensary Ordinance which requires and emphasizes background checks
20 for all dispensary personnel, extensive safety and security measures, plus
21 contingency plans, would necessarily be housed, conducted, and operated within

F:CLDAM54535\Pleadings\Sunol Ranch LLC Complaint-PWM 5-25-18.docx

(See, e.g., County Zoning Ordinance, Section 6.108.120 (A)(4).) In any case, here REAL
2 PARTY's application did not seek a dispensary tied to an existing cultivation use in
3 Alameda County. Nor does its application in any way indicate the proposed dispensary
4 seeks to engage in any on-site or adjacent cannabis cultivation. For all the above reasons,
5 REAL PARTY'S proposed dispensary is neither an agriculture enhancing use, visitor-
6 serving use, or any other defined or allowed by Measure D or the ECAP.

7 62. In sum, the proposed dispensary is not a use that promotes agriculture, is
8 not designed to primarily promote agricultural products grown or processed in Alameda
County any more than a grocery store in Alameda County somehow promotes
10 agriculture and/or products grown or processed in Alameda County. In fact, all of the
11 evidence shows that the primary sources of the' subject, proposed dispensary's cannabis
12 products would most likely be from locations other than Alameda County.
13 63. Whereas Measure D's other listed, allowed land uses, such as tasting rooms
14 and bed and breakfasts, can effectively showcase agriculturally-derived products,
15 produced on-site, and thereby promote "agri-tourism" in the region, REAL PARTY's
16 proposed dispensary would do nothing of the sort. Cannabis is nowhere alleged to be any
17 way representative of East County's agricultural heritage, which largely involves or
18 consists of vineyards. Cannabis is not grown on or near the subject site, nor even
19| supplied by growers in East County. Again, for all of these further reasons, application of
20 the County Dispensary Ordinance to the SUBJECT SITE is wholly inconsistent with
21 Measure D and the ECAP, common sense and logic, and the County's own, recently
22 enacted Dispensary Ordinance.

proposed dispensary is entirely inconsistent with not only the text, but also spirit and
2 intent, of the ECAP as clearly amended by the County's citizens in Measure D.

3 65. Despite all RESPONDENTS' above-noted rather vague hedging and
caveats e.g., about cannabis dispensaries somehow, perhaps being "possibly" consistent
5 with Measure D, "in some locations", depending on some as-yet-unformulated, future
6 "conditions" - RESPONDENTS failed to then, and have since never made, any required,
7 particularized determinations as to or imposed any specific conditions on - REAL
8 PARTY's proposed medical cannabis dispensary purportedly authorized by the
9 SUBJECT PERMIT. There is simply nothing in the relevant administrative record
10 remotely suggesting (much less demonstrating) such is an appropriate, conditionally-
11 permitted use in the agricultural district, outside the UGB as established, amended,
12 defined, and governed by Measure D and the ECAP.
13 66. Given the above, RESPONDENTS acted arbitrarily, capriciously, and
14 irrationally, abused and acted in excess of their respective jurisdiction, and failed to
15 proceed in the manner required by law, in denying/rejecting the FIRST APPEAL,
16 upholding the ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION, and issuing the SUBJECT PERMIT to

2 SUBJECT PERMIT, the County Dispensary Ordinance required the CDA to comment on

3 the proposed location for the dispensary and its compliance with the requirements of

4 subsections (d) and (e) of § 6.108.030.

5 93. Section 6.108.030 of the County Dispensary Ordinance provides that:

8 Alameda County General Plan, and any Specific Plan applicable to the location of
the dispensary, including the requirement to obtain any conditional use permits.
10 94. Here, the SUBJECT PERMIT is for a medical cannabis dispensary at the
11 SUBJECT PROPERTY that is a commercial activity regulated by MAUCRSA.
12 95. Also, the proposed dispensary at the SUBJECT PROPERTY is located
13 outside the UGB drawn or established by Measure D, the Save Agriculture and Open
