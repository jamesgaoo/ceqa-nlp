18 INTRODUCTION

19 Petitioner City of Newman ("Newman" or "Petitioner") petitions this Court for a writ of
20 mandate, directed to Respondents County of Stanislaus ("County"), the Stanislaus County Board

21 of Supervisors ("Board"), and the Stanislaus County Airport Land Use Commission ("ALUC")

22 (collectively, "Respondents"). Petitioner challenges the Board's October 30, 2018, certification of

23 the Environmental Impact Report (EIR") for the Crows Landing Industrial Business Park

24 Specific Plan ("Specific Plan"), the ALUC's November 15, 2018 approval of Airport Land Use

25 Commission Application No. PLN 2013-0091 to amend the Stanislaus County Airport Land Use

26 Compatibility Plan, and the Board's December 4, 2018, approval of the Specific Plan, General

27 Plan Amendment, and Rezone Application No. PLN 2013-0091 (collectively, the "Project").

Churchwell White wr Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

Through the Specific Plan, the County intends to develop a variety of

2 logistics/distribution, light industrial, business park and general aviation uses, and associated

3 public infrastructure on property owned by the County. Located along the Interstate 5 corridor,

4 the Specific Plan proposes to create approximately 15,000 new jobs.

5 Newman has been involved in discussions with the County throughout the Project's

6 development. Newman has both formally and informally voiced its concerns to the County

7 regarding the Project, including the Project's growth inducing impacts, impacts on housing, and

8 transportation impacts in Newman. As an example of the concerns Newman has expressed, the

9 Project does not include any residential uses, instead relying on nearby cities, including Newman,

10 to provide the necessary rooftops and related municipal services. Newman, however, has not

11 accounted for the Project's housing needs in its long-term planning documents. Thus, there is no

12 plan to provide the additional housing units required to meet the Project's needs.

13 On top of this, the current property tax sharing agreement between the County and

14 Newman provides for an inequitable split between Newman and the County in favor of the

15 County. As a consequence of the Project and the EIR's failure to analyze and mitigate impacts to

16 Newman, Newman is forced to not only provide the necessary housing for the Project without any

17 mitigation for that service, but to then share a majority of the tax revenue from the housing units it
18 provides with the County. This is one of the several cumulative and growth inducing impacts that
19 the EIR fails to analyze and mitigate.

20 The County has provided some acknowledgement of the Project's impacts on Newman,
21 it but it has not offered any enforceable mechanism to mitigate those impacts. Instead, the County
22 moved forward with certification of a final EIR for the Project on October 30, 2018, only ten days
23 after its publication, and after the release of more than 1,500 pages of new information and
24 technical appendices on October 19, 2018.

25 As a result of the EIR's failure to address the Project's impacts, Respondents abused their

26 discretion by certifying an invalid EIR on October 30, 2018, and by improperly relying on the
27 EIR when adopting the Project approvals on November 15 and December 4, 2018.

Churchwell White -. Amende Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

Petitioner alleges as follows:

2 PARTIES

3 1. Newman is a California municipal corporation, located in Stanislaus County, with

4 a population of approximately 11,500 people. Newman is general law city governed by the laws

5 of the State of California. The Project is located approximately 7.5 miles north of Newman city

6 limits.

7 2. Respondent County is a political subdivision of the State of California.

8 Respondent County is the CEQA lead agency for the Project. As lead agency, the County is

9 responsible for environmental review of the Project, which requires thorough analysis of the

10 potential environmental impacts and, if necessary, implementation of mitigation measures or

11 Project alternatives to minimize significant environmental impacts.

12 3. Respondent Board is a legislative body duly authorized under the California

13 Constitution and the laws of the State of California to act on behalf of the County. The Board is

14 responsible for regulating and controlling land use within the County, including, but not limited

15 to, implementing and complying with the provisions of CEQA and its implementing regulations

16 codified in the California Code of Regulations, title 14, section 15000 et seq. ("CEQA
17 Guidelines"). As the elected representatives of the people of the County, the Board establishes

18 County priorities and sets policy. The Board is the governing body of the County and is ultimately

19 responsible for certifying a valid EIR, reviewing the Project, and approving or denying the

20 Specific Plan based on the required findings under CEQA. The Board of Supervisors approved
21 the Specific Plan, General Plan Amendment, and Rezone Application No. PLN2013-0091 on

22 December 4, 2018.

23 4. Respondent ALUC is political subdivision of the State of California. The ALUC

24 is the agency responsible for preparing the Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan ("ALUCP") for

25 each public-use airport in the County, as required by the California State Aeronautics Act (Pub.

26 Util. Code, § 21670 et seq.). The purpose of the ALUCP is to promote compatibility between a
27 public-use airport and land uses in its vicinity. To accomplish this, the ALUCP establishes a set of

28 compatibility criteria that the ALUC uses to evaluate the compatibility of land use and airport

{CW071132.7) 3
Churchwell White- Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

proposals within the ALUC-established airport influence area. Respondent ALUC is a responsible

2 agency for the Project because the Project requires the ALUC's approval to amend the County

3 ALUCP. The ALUC approved the County ALUCP amendment on November 15, 2018.

4 5. Petitioner is informed and believes that there are no real parties in interest to the

5 petition because the County is the Project proponent.

6 6. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and identities of DOES through 20,

7 inclusive, and sues such unnamed Respondents by their fictitious names. Petitioner is informed

8 and believes, and based thereon alleges, that fictitiously named Respondents are also responsible
for all acts and omissions described herein. When the true identities and capacities of

10 Respondents have been determined, Petitioner will, with leave of the Court if necessary, amend

11 this Petition to include such Respondents and capacities.

12 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

13 7. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to

14 Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, and Public Resources Code section 21168. In the

15 alternative, this Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to Code of

16 Civil Procedure section 1085, and Public Resources Code section 21168.5.

17 8. Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the State of California
18 in and for the County of Stanislaus, pursuant to sections 393, 394, and 395 of the Code of Civil

19 Procedure.

20 BACKGROUND FACTS

21 9. The Project site is located in the unincorporated area of western Stanislaus

22 County, approximately 1.5 miles east of Interstate Highway 5 ("I-5"), and 7.5 miles north of

23 Newman. The 1,528-acre property is bounded by West Marshall Road to the north, State Route

24 33 to the northeast, Bell Road to the east, Fink Road to the south, and Davis Road and agricultural

25 land to the west. The Project site is generally surrounded by agricultural land uses, with some

26 residences in the vicinity, and the unincorporated community of Crows Landing is located

27 approximately 1.4 miles to the east. The Delta-Mendota Canal traverses the Project site in a
28 northwest-to-southeast direction. Regional access to the Project site would be provided by I-5 and

{CW071132.7) 4

Churchwell White- Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

State Route 33 ("Highway 33"), with local access provided by West Marshall Road at the site's

2 northern boundary and Ike Crow Road at its eastern boundary. Fink Road would provide access

3 between the Project site and I-5.

10. From 1942 to 1999, the Project site was developed and used by the federal

5 government to support the missions of the United States Navy and Coast Guard as the Crows

6 Landing Naval Auxiliary Landing Field, and subsequently the National Aeronautics and Space

7 Administration ("NASA") as the NASA Crows Landing Airport.

8 11. On October 27, 1999, Congress passed Public Law 106-82, which directed NASA

9 to convey the former military property to the County.

10 12. In 2008, voters in the County approved "Measure E," a "30-Year Land Use

11 Restriction Initiative". Measure E requires ballot approval by a majority of County voters prior to

12 the County Board approving any zone change to facilitate housing in existing agricultural land
13 use designations in unincorporated areas. As a result, residential development in unincorporated

14 areas of the County will be significantly more difficult through the duration of Measure E.

15 13. The County has contemplated the current iteration of the Project since at least

16 2012, when the County issued a request for proposals, seeking a master developer partner to
17 develop the Crows Landing Industrial Business Park. No master developer is currently

18 contemplated as part of the Project.

19 14. The Specific Plan identifies various land uses, including Aviation, Aviation-

20 compatible, Multimodal Access/Greenspace/Monument, Public Facilities, Logistics, Industrial,
21 and Business Park. These uses would be developed in three 10-year phases (i.e., 30 years) to
22 provide site development for approximately 14,000 to 15,000 jobs at full build-out and a

23 population of approximately 34,270 associated with those jobs.

24 15. On or about October 13, 2014, Respondents issued a notice of preparation

25 ("NOP") for the Project.

{CW071132.7} 5
Churchwell White-.• Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 16. On or about January 22, 2018, Respondents issued a notice of availability of the

2 draft EIR ("Draft EIR"), with the comment period closing on March 12, 2018. Respondents then

3 issued public notice extending the Draft EIR public review period on March 9, 2018. The Draft

4 EIR comment period formally closed on April 26, 2018.

5 17. On or about April 24, 2018, Newman submitted a comment letter to Respondents

6 on the Draft EIR, outlining several issues with the Draft EIR and its analysis, including traffic and

7 transportation, agricultural impacts, and aviation. The comment letter also identified the need to

8 consider the residential impact of the Project on the nearby municipalities.

9 18. On or about October 19, 2018, Respondents published the Final EIR, eight

10 appendixes to the Final EIR, amendments to the Specific Plan, and twelve appendixes to the

11 Specific Plan, totaling more than 1,500 pages, and issued a notice of public hearing to consider
12 certification of the Final EIR on October 30, 2018.

13 19. On October 29, 2018, Newman submitted an additional comment letter outlining

14 Newman's continued concerns with regard to the Project. The comment letter discussed the

15 Project's impacts on Newman's housing, transportation and the economic burden placed on

16 Newman a as a consequence of providing the additional housing units.

17 20. On or about October 30, 2018, Respondent Board held a public meeting to

18 consider and, over Petitioner's numerous objections, unanimously approved certification of the

19 Final EIR. During the public hearing to certify the Final EIR, the Board made a minor concession

20 to address Newman's traffic concerns by amending a mitigation measure to require "cumulative
21 fair-share basis [payment] in coordination with the City of Newman" to address signalization

22 along State Route 33.

23 21. On or about October 30, 2018, Respondents filed a notice of determination

24 ("NOD") with the County Clerk. Respondents filed the NOD prior to approving the Specific Plan

25 or any land use entitlements related to the Project.

26 22. On November 6, 2018, Respondents issued public notices for the Stanislaus

27 County Planning Commission and ALUC to consider recommending to the Board of Supervisors

28 approval of the necessary Project entitlements, including the Specific Plan, General Plan

{CW071132.7} 6
Churchwell White -* Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

Amendment, Rezone Application No. PLN2013-0091, and for the ALUC to approve Airport

2 Land Use Commission Application No. PLN2013-0091, at a meeting on November 15, 2018.

3 23. On November 15, 2018, the ALUC approved Airport Land Use Commission

4 Application No. PLN2013-0091 for the adoption of the Stanislaus County Airport Land Use

5 Compatibility Plan amendment.

24. On November 19, 2018, Respondents filed a second NOD following the ALUC's

7 adoption of the Stanislaus County Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan amendment.

8 25. On December 4, 2018, Respondent Board held a public meeting to consider and,

9 over Petitioner's numerous objections, unanimously approved the Project entitlements, including

10 the Specific Plan, General Plan Amendment, and Rezone Application No. PLN2013-0091.

11 26. On December 4, 2018, Respondents filed a third NOD following the Board's

12 approval of the Specific Plan, General Plan Amendment, and Rezone Application No. PLN2013-

13 0091.

14 27. Newman brings this action to challenge the County's certification of the EIR,

15 adoption of the amendment to the Stanislaus County Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan, and
16 approval of the Specific Plan, General Plan Amendment, and Rezone Application No. PLN2013-

17 0091.

18 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES AND INADEQUACY OF REMEDY

19 28. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant

20 action and has exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by

21 law.

22 29. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

23 21167.5 by mailing written notice of this action to the Respondents. A copy of this written notice

24 and proof of service are attached hereto as Exhibit A.

25 30. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.6 by
26 concurrently filing request concerning preparation of the record of administrative proceedings

27 relating to this action.

28 ///

{CW071132.7} 7
Churchwell White :* Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

31. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

2 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside their

3 certification of the EIR. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' approval will remain in
effect in violation of State law.

5 32. This action has been brought within 30 days of the filing of the NOD as required

6 by Public Resources Codes section 21167, subdivision (c). Respondents filed the first NOD on

7 the certification of the EIR with the County Clerk on October 30, 2018, even though no action

8 was taken relative to Project approval. Petitioner contends the October 30, 2018, NOD is

9 defective but is filing this Petition within thirty (30) days of the posting of the first NOD to avoid

10 any statute of limitations challenge by Respondents. Respondents filed a second NOD on the

11 ALUC adoption of the Stanislaus County Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan amendment on

12 November 19, 2018, and a third NOD on December 4, 2018, after the Board's approval of the
13 Specific Plan, General Plan Amendment, and Rezone Application No. PLN2013-0091.

14 STANDING

15 33. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because

16 Petitioner's municipal services, public facilities, air quality, and transportation and traffic
17 infrastructure will be directly and adversely affected by Respondents' certification of the EIR.

18 ARBITRARY AND CAPRICOUS ACTIONS

19 34. Petitioner brings this action on the basis, among others, of Government Code

20 section 800, and other applicable laws, which awards Petitioner attorneys' fees in actions to

21 overturn agency decisions that are arbitrary and capricious, such as the decisions in question

22 herein.

23 PRIVATE A T'ORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE

24 35. Petitioner brings this action as private attorney general pursuant to Code of Civil

25 Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important rights

26 affecting the public. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a significant

27 benefit on a large class of persons by ensuring that Respondents do not certify an EIR, approve a

28 Project, and illegally expend public funds in the absence of lawful environmental review.

{CW071132.7} 8
Churchwell White: Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION - Abuse of Discretion - Mitigation Measures Are Not Enforceable As Required By CEQA

2 (Violation of CEQA, Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)

36. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein, as if set forth in full, each and every
allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 35.

37. The Draft EIR states that the Project will generate additional traffic and degrade

6 levels of service ("LOS") at State Route 33 south of Stuhr Road, north of Newman, leading to a

7 significant impact. (Draft EIR, 3.14-18-19.) In response to these significant impacts, the EIR

8 focuses on contribution of its fair-share to road widening improvements on SR 33, south of Stuhr

9 Road and north of Newman, from two to four lanes. (Draft EIR, 5-35.) "However, the County

10 cannot guarantee that these improvements would be implemented because they would be under

11 the jurisdiction of Caltrans and would depend on the availability and prioritization of state and

12 federal funds. There is no additional feasible mitigation available." (Draft EIR, 5-35.) Further, at
13 the October 30, 2018, Board public hearing to certify the EIR, the Board, by motion, amended the

14 EIR to state that "[t]he [P]roject shall contribute on a cumulative fair-share basis, in coordination

15 with the City of Newman, to signalization of the following intersections: ... SR 33 intersections

16 with Stuhr Road, Jensen Road, Yolo Street, and Inyo Street." (See also, Final EIR, 2.3-14-10, 3-

17 21.)

18 38. The proposed mitigation measure lacks a clear, enforceable commitment to a

19 mitigation program. In contrast, Appendix F of the EIR, the Transportation Infrastructure Plan,

20 provides several enforceable recommendations for mitigating the Project's impacts on traffic and

21 transportation. These recommendations include: establishment of a comprehensive strategy to

22 reduce solo occupant vehicle travel by employees, business vehicles including trucks, and

23 visitors; establishing a designated transportation demand management organization that requires
24 mandatory involvement by all companies within the Project and assigning a person representing

25 the Project on an ongoing basis to coordinate with individual businesses; requiring each

26 individual business within the Project to establish a designated transportation demand
27 management company representative; requiring the transportation demand management

28 organization to include annual mandatory employee surveys with a required response rate of at

(CW071132.7} 9
Churchwell White e Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

P least 90 percent of employees; and requiring the transportation demand management company to

2 prepare an annual report indicating status of compliance with transportation demand management

3 goals established by the County. (Appendix F, 41-42.)

4 39. However, neither Newman nor Caltrans has committed to make enough

5 improvements to accommodate buildout of the Project, buildout of the Newman General Plan,

6 and the Project's growth inducing impacts on population and housing. There is no substantial

7 evidence that Newman nor Caltrans are committed to scheduling the improvements in a way that a

8 would timely mitigate the increase in vehicle traffic from the Project. Respondents cannot

9 abdicate their responsibility to analyze and mitigate significant impacts because certain

10 intersections are outside their jurisdiction. Respondents must analyze alternative mitigation

11 measures or commit itself to some enforceable mitigation measure.

12 40. As a mitigation measure, the Final EIR focuses on the County directing

13 leaseholders, developers, and contractors to reimburse Newman its fair-share costs for off-site
14 transportation and traffic improvements and implementation of mitigation measures. (Final EIR,

15 2.3.6-48, 2.3.6-49.)

16 41. At its certification hearing, the Board amended the EIR mitigation measures to

17 include language that the County must consult with Newman to establish a fair share fee for

18 roadway impacts. At that same hearing, however, the Board and County Counsel noted that the

19 revised mitigation measure only required an effort to consult and did not necessarily require

20 agreement between the County and Newman or an enforceable fair share percentage that would

21 be attributable to development within the Specific Plan.

22 42. However, the EIR does not require leaseholders, developers, and contractors to

23 pay their fair-share of transportation and traffic improvement costs to Newman. The EIR merely

24 states that Respondents will facilitate the transfer of fair-share costs in coordination with

25 Newman. Agreeing to facilitate the transfer of funds is not the same as a binding commitment.

26 The EIR may not rely on a future mitigation measure that is not enforceable. The EIR fails to

27 implement the enforceable mitigation measures recommended in the Transportation Infrastructure

28 Plan.

{CW071132.7} 10
Churchwell White -$ Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

43. There is no commitment by Respondents to carry out an enforceable mitigation

2 measure, as recommended in the Transportation Infrastructure Plan. There is no evidence that

3 Respondents have committed to an enforceable mitigation plan involving the improvement or

4 I maintenance of the various local roadways due to increased vehicle traffic that will be caused by

5 the Project. Thus, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by certifying the EIR and

6 approving the Project when it has not committed to sufficient enforceable mitigation measures.

7 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
Abuse of Discretion - Significant New Information
8 Required Recirculation of the EIR

9 (Violation of CEQA, Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)

10 44. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein, as if set forth in full, each and every
11 allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 43.

12 A. Growth Induced Housing
13 45. In the Draft EIR, the discussion of growth inducing impacts is very short,
14 approximately one-page long. The Draft EIR discusses how the Project's approximately 14,000 to
15 15,000 jobs will lead to additional housing demand in the County and region. (Draft EIR, 5-43.)
16 However, the Draft EIR does not discuss where the additional housing demand may be located
17 and whether there is enough additional housing in the area to accommodate the job growth and
18 accompanying population growth.

19 46. The Final EIR estimates that 15,000 employees would generate a population of
20 approximately 34,270. (Final EIR, 2.2-5.) Assuming the County's current average household size,
21 11,200 new housing units would be needed to house the expected population growth. (Final EIR,
22 2.2-5.) The EIR proposes that the increased population growth is likely to locate in Newman,
23 Patterson, Turlock, and the County-wide unincorporated area. (Final EIR, 2.2-5.) The EIR states

24 that Newman, Patterson, Turlock, and the County-wide unincorporated area will develop enough
25 housing to fully accommodate the increased population growth. (Final EIR, 2.2-5.)
26 47. The EIR added significant new information regarding the Project's growth
27 inducing impacts, where that population growth may locate, and whether those areas have
28 housing capacity to accommodate that growth.

{CW071132.7} 11
Churchwell White -.s Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 48. The addition of this significant new information without recirculating the EIR

2 deprived the public of a meaningful opportunity to comment on substantial adverse project

3 impacts, feasible mitigation measures, or alternatives before certification of the EIR.

4 49. In particular, as discussed further below, Newman will be substantially harmed by

5 the Project's growth inducing impacts because Newman is one of the closest incorporated cities to

6 the Project. A significant portion of the Project's growth inducing impacts is likely to locate in

7 Newman, including population growth and housing. Thus, Newman was wholly deprived of any

8 meaningful opportunity to comment on how the Project's growth inducing impacts will directly
affect them because the Draft EIR did not include this information.

10 B. Traffic Analysis

11 50. The Draft EIR provided no analysis of traffic impacts within Newman city limits.

12 While the Draft EIR mentions the intersection of State Route 33 and Stuhr Road, this intersection

13 is outside Newman city limits. (See e.g., Draft EIR, 3.14-19.) Newman raised the concern

14 regarding the EIR's failure to analyze traffic impacts within Newman city limits and the failure to

15 explain the Project's fair-share basis in its April 24, 2018, comment letter.

16 51. In response, the Final EIR included an updated Appendix A, the Transportation

17 Infrastructure Plan ("TIP"). For the first time, the TIP provided an analysis of three intersections

18 in Newman: State Route 33/Jenson Road, State Route 33/Yolo Street; State Route 33/Inyo Street.
19 (Final EIR, Appendix A, 36.) Further, the TIP concluded that the Project's fair share of these

20 impacts is 14 percent. (Final EIR, Appendix A, 36.)

21 52. As Newman raised in its comment letters, the Draft EIR failed to analyze traffic

22 impacts to Newman. Further, the Draft EIR did not accurately describe the Project's fair share

23 basis for traffic impacts to Newman. The updated TIP was the first time this information was

24 made available to Newman.

25 53. • The addition of this significant new information without recirculating the EIR
26 deprived Newman and the general public of a meaningful opportunity to comment on substantial
27 adverse project impacts, feasible mitigation measures, or alternatives before certification of the

28 EIR.

{CW071132.7} 12
Churchwell White Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

54.

2 Newman was deprived of any meaningful opportunity to comment on how the

3 Project's growth inducing impacts will directly affect them because the Draft EIR did not include

4 this information. Fourteen percent of the Project's fair share is woefully inadequate as a

Un mitigation measure considering the Project's growth inducing impacts. Had the Draft EIR

6 included this information, Newman would have raised numerous objections, provided additional

7 information for the County to consider, and called for the EIR to reanalyze its fair share.

55.

8 By failing to recirculate the EIR for additional comments based on the significant

9 new information regarding growth induced impacts and traffic added to the Final EIR,

10 Respondents have prejudicially abused their discretion in certifying the EIR and approving the
Project.

11 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

12 Abuse of Discretion The EIR's Impact Analysis Is Insufficient

13 56. (Violation of CEQA, Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)

14 Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein, as if set forth in full, each and every
allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 55.

15 57.

16 The EIR improperly assumes that local planning documents already account for

17 and accommodate the Project's growth inducing and cumulative impacts. However, the EIR fails

18 to recognize that local jurisdictions have projected their own growth separate and aside from the

19 Project's growth inducing impacts. An analysis of local growth and Project-induced growth,

20 taken and reviewed together, will reveal significant environmental impacts that have not been
analyzed by Respondents.

21 A. Growth Induced Housing

22 58.

23 The EIR estimates that full buildout of the Project will result in the creation of

24 14,000 to 15,000 new jobs within the Specific Plan area. (Final EIR, 2.2-4.) Since approximately

25 44 percent of the County's total population is in the labor force, the EIR estimates that 15,000

26 employees would generate a population of approximately 34,270. (Final EIR, 2.2-5.) Assuming

27 the County's current average household size, 11,200 new housing units would be needed to house
the expected population growth. (Final EIR, 2.2-5.)

59. Patterson and Newman are the only two incorporated cities on the west side of the

2 County. Each city is located near the Project. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that most of the

3 Project's employees will relocate in Patterson and Newman, especially in light of the Measure E

4 development restrictions on unincorporated parts of the County.

60. The overarching objective for the Specific Plan is to provide high-quality

6 employment opportunities in the County; the EIR must analyze the Project consistent with its

7 objectives.

8 61. Patterson currently has a population of approximately 22,100. Newman currently

9 has a population of approximately 11,300. Together Patterson and Newman have an approximate

10 population of 33,400. A population increase of 34,270 would more than double the current

11 populations of Patterson and Newman alone. While the EIR anticipates that population growth

12 will be spread between Patterson, Newman, Turlock and the unincorporated area, Patterson and

13 Newman will likely absorb a majority of the growth because they are the two closest incorporated

14 cities to the Project.

15 62. The EIR relies on County planning documents to state that the local community

16 sufficiently projects enough additional housing to accommodate for the Project's induced housing
17 needs. (Final EIR, 2.2-5.) Specifically, the Final EIR relies on the 2014 Regional Transportation
18 Plan and the Sustainable Communities Strategy's ("RTP/SCS") and 2014-2023 Stanislaus
19 Council of Governments ("StanCOG") Regional Housing Needs Plan ("RHNA").

20 63. The Final EIR cites the RTP/SCS forecast that 16,000 additional housing units
21 will be built in Patterson, Newman, and unincorporated areas between 2020 and 2040. (Final EIR,

22 2.2-5.) The Final EIR also cites the StanCOG RHNA to extrapolate data regarding how many
23 housing units will be built in the area during the Project's buildout.' (Final EIR, 2.2-5.) Based on

24 this questionable methodology, the Final EIR estimates that 18,256 housing units will be built

25 between 2020 to 2040 in Newman, Patterson, Turlock, and the County-wide unincorporated area.

26 1 The StanCOG RHNA is based on a 10-year timeframe. However, the Final EIR uses the StanCOG RHNA
27 numbers to calculate the number of housing units that will be built over 20-years. The StanCOG RHNA numbers do not represent the best available methodology to calculate expected housing buildout over 20 years. Further, in this

28 portion of the Final EIR, it discusses the Project's buildout over a span of 20 years. However, the Draft EIR specifically states that the Project is estimated to be built in three 10-year phases, over 30 years. The Project description is not consistent. (CW071132.7} 14
Churchwell White : Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

(Final EIR, 2.2-5.) Thus, the EIR concludes that the local community "will be planning for

2 housing in excess of what would be necessary to house employees of the Specific Plan Area."

3 (Final EIR, 2.2-5.)

4 64. The RTP/SCS and StanCOG RHNA, however, do not contemplate the Project and

5 its potential growth inducing impacts. The Project is not even discussed in those documents. The

6 Final EIR's conclusion that sufficient housing will be available to meet the Project's growth

7 inducing impacts ignores the growth projections in the referenced studies and therefore is not

8 based on substantial evidence. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by certifying the

9 EIR.

10 65. The Final EIR's flaw in relying on the local community to accommodate its

11 growth inducing impacts is further revealed when examining planning documents for Newman.

12 66. Newman adopted its most recent general plan amendments in 2007 and updated
13 its housing element in 2016. The Newman General Plan and its housing element do not discuss

14 the Project, nor any growth inducing impacts that might result from the Project. The Newman

15 General Plan is focused on the city's own growth.

16 67. Since the Newman General Plan does not discuss the Project, local growth is

17 projected to happen regardless of the Project. Thus, the EIR did not analyze any cumulative
18 impacts from Newman's projected growth together with the Project's growth inducing impacts.

19 Due to the cumulative impacts from the Project and local growth, there will not be adequate

20 housing to meet future demand in the area.

21 68. While the local community may have forecasted additional housing demand due

22 to their own projected growth, the EIR falsely assumes that these growth forecasts take into

23 account the Project's induced growth. Local planning documents do not discuss the Project, nor
24 accommodate for the Project's induced growth. Thus, there is no substantial evidence to support

25 the EIR's assumption that the local community has accounted for and will accommodate the

26 Project's growth inducing impacts.

27 ///

{CW071132.7) 15
Churchwell White * Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

- 69. This failure is especially egregious when considered in the context of the property

2 tax implications of requiring Newman to address the housing of the Project without mitigating

3 any of the impacts from the growth the Project has induced. Newman will share the property taxes

4 for all new housing units on a basis of 70 percent to the County and 30 percent to Newman. Thus,

5 the failure to analyze and mitigate the growth inducing housing impacts of the Project continues

6 to impact Newman beyond just providing additional housing without any mitigation for that

7 service.

8 70. Further, it is an abuse of discretion for the EIR to rely on housing development in

9 the unincorporated areas of the County. Following the adoption of Measure E, residential

10 development in the unincorporated areas of the County is substantially more difficult to approve

11 and less likely to be developed. No substantial evidence supports the finding that the

12 unincorporated areas of the County can support housing development for the Project's growth

13 inducing impacts. Respondents reliance on baseless assumptions in the EIR to approve the Project

14 entitlements is arbitrary and capricious.

15 B. Municipal Services

16 71. The Draft EIR incorrectly assumes that no additional schools, parks, recreational

17 facilities, or other public facilities (e.g., libraries) will be necessary, because the Project does not

18 include residential development. (Draft EIR, 3.13-1, 5-28.) Further, the Draft EIR states that

19 "[t]he County has elected not to speculate as to whether there would be any population-related

20 cumulative impact related to schools, parks and recreational facilities, or other types of public

21 services and facilities to which the project could contribute." (Draft EIR, 5-29-30, emphasis in

22 original.)

23 72. The Project cannot assume that no additional schools, parks, recreational

24 facilities, and other public facilities will be necessary because the Project itself does not include

25 residential development. While the EIR need not speculate, it must analyze reasonably

26 foreseeable impacts.

27 73. As the EIR admits, the Project's growth inducing impacts will result in direct

28 population growth of 34,270 residents to the local community. A significant amount of this

{CW071132.7} 16
Churchwell White .: Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 population growth will likely be concentrated in the two nearest incorporated cities of Patterson

2 and Newman. This population growth could double the current populations of Patterson and

3 Newman.

4 74. These new residents to the local community will cause an increase in intensity of

5 use to local schools, parks, recreational facilities, and other public facilities. Existing public

6 facilities will not be sufficient to accommodate all the new residents. Additional school facilities,

7 parks, recreational facilities, and other public facilities will need to be constructed to accommodate

8 the significant population increase and change in intensity of use of existing facilities.

9 75. In Stanislaus County, approximately 27.1 percent of the County is younger than

10 18 years old and thus of schooling age. Assuming the Project induced population growth will

11 have similar age characteristics, population increase of 34,270 would also increase the school

12 age population by approximately 9,287.

13 76. The Patterson Joint Unified School District has an enrollment of approximately

14 5,500 students. The Newman-Crows Landing Unified School District has an enrollment of
15 approximately 3,000 students. The Patterson Joint and Newman-Crows Landing Unified School

16 Districts have a combined enrollment of 8,500 students less than the estimated 9,000 Project-

17 related student population growth.

18 77. If a majority of the Project growth inducing student population were to attend

19 schools in Patterson Joint and Newman-Crows Landing Unified School Districts, school facilities

20 would have to effectively double. A significant amount of construction would be necessary to
21 double existing school facilities to accommodate the increased student population resulting from
22 Project-induced growth. This construction will lead to physical impacts on the environment,
23 including, but not limited to, dust and noise from construction activities. The EIR failed to

24 analyze these construction impacts related to building new school facilities. Further, increased
25 traffic resulting from trips to and from new school facilities were not analyzed. The Project
26 related growth impacts on local schools is not speculative. This is a clear and foreseeable impact

27 that the EIR must address but failed to analyze.

28 ///

{CW071132.7} 17
Churchwell White • Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

78. The EIR should have committed to enforceable mitigation measures to mitigate

2 impacts to local schools. For example, the EIR should have analyzed and required mitigation

3 measures such a as a fair-share programs which require all future Project leaseholders, developers,

4 and contractors to contribute school fees.

79. Similarly, the increased population is likely to increase the intensity of use of

6 parks, recreational facilities, and other public facilities. The record contains no evidence of overall
usage or capacity of public facilities. Moreover, the EIR makes no attempt to determine the

8 current use of schools, parks, recreational facilities, or other public facilities by existing residents

9 or to extrapolate from such data estimated increased usage by an additional 34,270 residents.

10 80. The EIR falsely assumes that the additional schools and public facilities necessary

11 to service the Project are speculative. These environmental impacts are clear and foreseeable. As

12 an informational document, the EIR failed to contain sufficient information to enable

13 Respondents to properly consider the Project's environmental consequences related to schools,

14 parks, recreational facilities, and other public facilities. By relying on the EIR to approve the

15 Project entitlements, Respondents have acted in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, and an

16 abuse of discretion.

17 C. Traffic

18 81. The Draft EIR analyzes the Project's traffic impacts in sections 3.14 and 5-30
19 through 5-36 and in Appendix F, the TIP, of the Draft EIR. The EIR's traffic analysis again
20 wrongly assumes that the Project's impacts to traffic are synonymous with local traffic patterns.

21 Thus, the EIR understates the Project's true impacts to traffic and transportation. The Final EIR

22 updates the TIP, provides an analysis of traffic within Newman city limits for the first time, and

23 estimates the Project's fair share for traffic impacts to Newman at 14 percent. (Final EIR,

24 Appendix A, 36.)

25 82. The EIR relies upon Newman's existing plans to implement signalization at State
26 Route 33 and Inyo Street, State Route 33 and Yolo Street, and State Route 33 and Jensen Road.

27 (Final EIR, Appendix A, 36.) Newman's plans to implement signalization were made before the

28 Project was proposed and the Project was not considered as part of Newman's expansion plans.

{CW071132.7) 18
Churchwell White -. Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

- Consequently, it is not clear that the presently planned road expansions will be sufficient to serve

2 both Newman's and the Project's needs. No study has been done to determine if the proposed

3 expansion will provide the correct level of service given the Project's growth inducing impacts.

4 Further, there is no guarantee that Newman will these implement these signalization

5 improvements within the required timeframe to support the Project.

6 83. The EIR understates and underestimates the Project's traffic impacts to Newman.

7 By understating and underestimating the Project's traffic impacts on Newman, the EIR fails to
properly analyze the Project's environmental impacts and fails to commit to sufficient enforceable

9 mitigation measures.

10 D. Air Quality

11 84. Chapter 3.2 of the Draft EIR discusses air quality impacts and focuses on impacts

12 from construction emissions, operational emissions, with operational emissions from mobile

13 sources limited to vehicle trips from "employees, visitors, and goods movement." (Draft EIR, 3.2-
14 28.)

15 85. The EIR fails to analyze additional air quality impacts from the Project's growth

16 inducing impacts. Particularly, the Project will increase the local population by approximately

17 34,270. While the EIR accounts for portion of the population increase as employees of the
18 Project, the remaining portion of the population increase (e.g., spouses) and their impacts on air
19 quality are not discussed in the EIR.

20 86. The increased population will require the local community to engage in additional

21 construction activities, such as building schools, parks, recreational facilities, and improving

22 roads. The EIR failed to analyze these direct, foreseeable impacts.

23 87. Moreover, the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District is in non-
24 attainment for several pollutants. By understating the additional air quality impacts from the
25 Project's growth there is no clear determination the additional amount of pollutants that will be

26 a released as a consequence of the Project. This results in the Project's contribution to continued
27 non-attainment in the Basin unanalyzed and unmitigated.

28 ///

{CW071132.7) 19
Churchwell White .$ Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

88. The EIR understates and underestimates the Project's air quality impacts. The EIR

2 fails as an informational document. By relying on the EIR to approve the Project, Respondents

3 have prejudicially abused their discretion.

4 G. Greenhouse Gas Emissions

5 89. The Draft EIR concludes that the Project's greenhouse gas impacts will be

6 "cumulatively considerable." (Draft EIR, 3.7-16.) The Draft EIR analyzes greenhouse gas

7 emissions from construction-related emissions and operational emissions. (Draft EIR, 3.7-16-17.)

8 90. The EIR does not discuss analyzing greenhouse gas emissions associated with its

9 growth inducing impacts. Thus, the EIR underestimates and understates the Project's greenhouse

10 gas emissions. The EIR fails as an informational document. By relying on the EIR to approve the
11 Project, Respondents have prejudicially abused their discretion.

12 91. The mitigation considered for these impacts focuses on Project specific

13 approaches rather than considering other available mitigation for greenhouse gas emissions such

14 as offsets or carbon trading programs. Despite this, the EIR finds that all greenhouse gas

15 emissions impacts that are cumulatively considerable are significant and unavailable.

16 H. Cumulative Impacts

17 92. The EIR underestimates the extent its growth inducing impacts will affect the
18 environment. Thus, the EIR failed to evaluate the true severity and significance of the cumulative
19 impacts from the Project. By understating information in the EIR, Respondents could not properly

20 consider and adopt appropriate and effective mitigation measures, skews its perspective

21 concerning the benefits of the particular project under consideration, and precludes it from
22 gaining a true perspective on the consequences of approving the Project. Thus, the EIR fails as an

23 informational document and Respondents abused their discretion by relying on the EIR to
24 approve the Project.

25 1. Growth Inducing Impacts

26 93. The Project is estimated to create 14,000 to 15,000 jobs and increase the local

27 population by approximately 34,270, which will require approximately 11,200 new residential

28 units. (Final EIR, 2.2-5.) The EIR assumes that the local community will develop enough housing

{CW071132.7) 20
Churchwell White .P Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

during Project buildout to accommodate the Project's growth inducing housing requirements.

2 (Final EIR, 2.2-5.) The EIR cites the StanCOG RTP/SCS to state that the County population

3 could increase by 37 percent and employment by 35 percent between 2008 and 2040. (Draft EIR,

4 5.30.) Thus, the EIR admits that the cumulative impact of regional growth could "require

5 additional facilities to be constructed, the construction of which could have potentially significant

6 impacts. This is a significant cumulative impact." (Draft EIR, 5-30.)

7 94. The EIR fails to consider that the StanCOG RTP/SCS does not consider the

8 Project's growth inducing impacts in its analysis. The Project will create additional population

9 and employment growth beyond what is projected in the RTP/SCS. Thus, the EIR underestimates

10 and understates its growth inducing impacts on the environment. Local forecasts of increases to

11 population and employment could be substantially higher when the Project's growth inducing

12 impacts are taken into account along with other planned developments. The additional resources

13 and housing necessary to accommodate the extra population growth will be more than the EIR

14 estimated.

15 95. By understating and underestimating its growth inducing impacts, the EIR fails to

16 properly analyze the Project's environmental impacts and fails to commit to sufficient enforceable

17 mitigation measures.

18 2. Municipal Services

19 96. The Project is estimated to create 14,000 to 15,000 jobs and increase the local

20 population by approximately 34,270. Of the population growth, approximately 9,200 are
21 estimated to be school-aged children. This increase in population and school-aged children could
22 double the population of nearby Patterson and Newman and their respective school districts. The

23 increased population will also increase the intensity of use of parks, recreational facilities, and

24 other public services and facilities. To accommodate doubling its population and school

25 enrollment, Patterson and Newman will be forced to build new schools, parks, recreational

26 facilities, and other public services and facilities. However, the EIR elected not to speculate as to

27 such impacts on public services and recreation. (Draft EIR 5-29-30.)

28 ///

{CW071132.7} 21
Churchwell White-s Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

97. Other planned developments in Patterson and Newman, such as Newman's

2 Northwest Master Plan area, will also increase the local population and school-aged children

3 population. These cumulative effects are not speculative. The EIR failed to analyze the Project's

4 growth inducing impacts with the impacts of other development in the County on public services

5 and recreation. These cumulative impacts will be significant and must be mitigated. To mitigate

6 against these impacts to schools, parks, recreational facilities, and other public services and

7 facilities, the EIR should have analyzed establishing a public services and facilities demand

8 program and requiring all leaseholders, developers, and contractions to participate in the program

9 by paying their fair-share.

10 3. Traffic

11 98. The EIR claims to have considered the impacts of the Newman General Plan

12 buildout, the Northwest Newman Master Plan, and Newman's traffic studies. (Final EIR,

13 Appendix A, 36.) To mitigate against the cumulative impacts of the Project on transportation and

14 traffic infrastructure, the EIR focuses on signalization within Newman. In particular, the EIR

15 relies on Newman's plans to implement signalization mitigation measures outside the County's
16 jurisdiction and within Newman.

17 99. Newman's plans to add signals to specific intersections were developed without
18 consideration of the Project's traffic impacts. Further, Newman's General Plan and signalization

19 projects do not take into account the additional traffic impacts generated by the Project's growth

20 inducing impacts.

21 100. The planned mitigation measures are insufficient to accommodate buildout of the

22 Newman General Plan, buildout of the Project, and the Project's growth inducing impacts on

23 population and traffic.

24 101. By failing to also analyze traffic related to the Project's growth inducing impacts,
25 the EIR grossly understates and underestimates the impact the Project will have on traffic and

26 transportation.

27 ///

28 ///

(CW071132.7} 22
Churchwell White .s Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

4. Air Quality

2 102. The EIR analyzed air quality impacts from the Project's construction and
operational emissions, with operational emissions focused on vehicle trips from "employees,

4 visitors, and goods movement." (Draft EIR, 3.2-28.)

103. The EIR does not analyze the cumulative air quality impacts from the Project, the

6 Project's growth inducing impacts, and buildout of Newman's General Plan. By failing to also

7 analyze air quality related to the Project's growth inducing impacts, the EIR understates and

8 underestimates the impact the Project will have on air quality.

9 5. Greenhouse Gas Emissions

10 104. The Draft EIR analyzes greenhouse gas emissions from construction-related
11 emissions and operational emissions. (Draft EIR, 3.7-16-17.) The cumulative impact analysis for

12 greenhouse gas emissions is four (4) sentences long. It concludes that the cumulative greenhouse

13 gas emissions are "cumulatively considerable" and that the impact is "significant and

14 unavoidable." (Draft EIR, 5-14.)

15 105. The EIR does not analyze the cumulative greenhouse gas emissions from the

16 Project, the Project's growth inducing impacts, and buildout of Newman's General Plan. By

17 failing to also analyze greenhouse gas emissions related to the Project's growth inducing impacts,
18 the EIR grossly understates and underestimates the impact the Project will have on greenhouse
19 gas emissions.

20 106. By understating and underestimating the Project's cumulative impacts, the EIR

21 fails to properly analyze the Project's environmental impacts and fails to commit to sufficient

22 enforceable mitigation measures.

22 of Supervisors ("Board"), and the Stanislaus County Airport Land Use Commission (collectively,

23 "Respondents"). Petitioner challenges the County Board's October 30, 2018, certification of the

24 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the Crows Landing Industrial Business Park Specific

25 Plan ("Specific Plan"), and the ALUC's November 15, 2018 approval of Airport Land Use

26 Commission Application No. PLN 2013-0091 to amend the Stanislaus County Airport Land Use

27 Compatibility Plan (collectively, the "Project").

(CW070795.2)
aurchwell White w Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 Through the Specific Plan, the County intends to develop a variety of logistics/distribution,

2 light industrial, business park and general aviation uses, and associated public infrastructure on

3 property owned by the County. Located along the Interstate 5 corridor, the Specific Plan proposes

4 to create approximately 15,000 new jobs.

5 Newman has been involved in discussions with the County throughout the Project's

6 development. Newman has both formally and informally voiced its concerns to the County

7 regarding the Project, including the Project's growth inducing impacts, impacts on housing, and

8 transportation impacts in Newman. As an example of the concerns Newman has expressed, the

9 Project does not include any residential uses, instead relying on nearby cities, including Newman,

10 to provide the necessary rooftops and related municipal services. Newman, however, has not

11 accounted for the Project's housing needs in its long-term planning documents. Thus, there is no

12 plan to provide the additional housing units required to meet the Project's needs.

13 On top of this, the current property tax sharing agreement between the County and

14 Newman provides for an inequitable split between Newman and the County in favor of the

15 County. As a consequence of the Project and the EIR's failure to analyze and mitigate impacts to

16 Newman, Newman is forced to not only provide the necessary housing for the Project without any

17 mitigation for that service, but to then share a majority of the tax revenue from the housing units it

18 provides with the County. This is one of the several cumulative and growth inducing impacts that

19 the EIR fails to analyze and mitigate.

20 The County has provided some acknowledgement of the Project's impacts on Newman,

21 but it has not offered any enforceable mechanism to mitigate those impacts. Instead, the County

22 moved forward with certification of a final EIR for the Project on October 30, 2018, only ten days

23 after its publication, and after the release of more than 1,500 pages of new information and

24 technical appendices on October 19, 2018.

25 As a result of the EIR's failure to address the Project's impacts, Respondents abused their

26 discretion by certifying an invalid EIR on October 30, 2018, and by improperly relying on the

27 EIR when adopting the Project approvals on November 15, 2018.

Churchwell White ue Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

Petitioner alleges as follows:

2 PARTIES

1. Newman is a California municipal corporation, located in Stanislaus County, with
4 a population of approximately 11,500 people. Newman is a general law city governed by the laws
of the State of California. The Project is located approximately 7.5 miles north of Newman city

6 limits.

2. Respondent County of Stanislaus is a political subdivision of the State of
California. Respondent County of Stanislaus is the CEQA lead agency for the Project. As lead

9 agency, the County is responsible for environmental review of the Project, which requires

10 thorough analysis of the potential environmental impacts and, if necessary, implementation of

11 mitigation measures or Project alternatives to minimize significant environmental impacts.

12 3. Respondent Stanislaus County Board of Supervisors is legislative body duly

13 authorized under the California Constitution and the laws of the State of California to act on

14 behalf of the County of Stanislaus. The County Board is responsible for regulating and controlling

15 land use within the County, including, but not limited to, implementing and complying with the

16 provisions of CEQA and its implementing regulations codified in the California Code of

17 Regulations, Title 14, section 15000 et seq. ("CEQA Guidelines"). As the elected representatives

18 of the people of the County, the Board establishes County priorities and sets policy. The Board is

19 the governing body of the County and is ultimately responsible for certifying a valid EIR,

20 reviewing the Project, and approving or denying the Specific Plan based on the required findings

21 under CEQA.

22 4. Respondent Stanislaus County Airport Land Use Commission (*ALUC") is a

23 political subdivision of the State of California. The ALUC is the agency responsible for preparing

24 the Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan ("ALUCP") for each public-use airport in the County, as

25 required by the California State Aeronautics Act (Pub. Util. Code, §§ 21670 et seq.). The purpose

26 of the ALUCP is to promote compatibility between a public-use airport and land uses in its

27 vicinity. To accomplish this, the ALUCP establishes a set of compatibility criteria that the ALUC

28 uses to evaluate the compatibility of land use and airport proposals within the ALUC-established

{CW070795.2) 3
Churchwell White uP Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

airport influence area. Respondent ALUC is a responsible agency for the Project because the

2 Project requires the ALUC's approval to amend the Stanislaus County ALUCP. The ALUC

3 approved the Stanislaus County ALUCP amendment on November 15, 2018.

4 5. Petitioner is informed and believes that there are no real parties in interest to the

5 petition because the County is the Project proponent.

6 6. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and identities of DOES through 20,

7 inclusive, and sues such unnamed Respondents by their fictitious names. Petitioner is informed

8 and believes, and based thereon alleges, that fictitiously named Respondents are also responsible

9 for all acts and omissions described herein. When the true identities and capacities of

10 Respondents have been determined, Petitioner will, with leave of the Court if necessary, amend

11 this Petition to include such Respondents and capacities.

12 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

13 7. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to

14 Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, and Public Resources Code section 21168. In the

15 alternative, this Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to Code of

16 Civil Procedure section 1085, and Public Resources Code section 21168.5.

17 8. Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the State of California

18 in and for the County of Stanislaus pursuant to sections 393, 394, and 395 of the Code of Civil

19 Procedure.

20 BACKGROUND FACTS

21 9. The Project site is located in the unincorporated area of western Stanislaus County,

22 approximately 1.5 miles east of Interstate Highway 5 ("I-5"), and 7.5 miles north of the City of

23 Newman. The 1,528-acre property is bounded by West Marshall Road to the north, State Route
24 33 to the northeast, Bell Road to the east, Fink Road to the south, and Davis Road and

25 agricultural land to the west. The Project site is generally surrounded by agricultural land uses,

26 with some residences in the vicinity, and the unincorporated community of Crows Landing is

27 located approximately 1.4 miles to the east. The Delta-Mendota Canal traverses the Project site

28 in a northwest-to-southeast direction. Regional access to the Project site would be provided by I-

{CW070795.2) 4

Churchwell White uP Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

5 and State Route 33 (Highway 33), with local access provided by West Marshall Road at the

2 site's northern boundary and Ike Crow Road at its eastern boundary. Fink Road would provide

3 access between the Project site and I-5.

10. From 1942 to 1999, the Project site was developed and used by the federal
government to support the missions of the United States Navy and Coast Guard as the Crows

6 Landing Naval Auxiliary Landing Field, and subsequently the National Aeronautics and Space

7 Administration ("NASA") as the NASA Crows Landing Airport.

8 11. On October 27, 1999, Congress passed Public Law 106-82, which directed NASA

9 to convey the former military property to the County of Stanislaus.

10 12. In 2008, voters in Stanislaus County approved "Measure E," a "30-Year Land Use

11 Restriction Initiative". Measure E requires ballot approval by a majority of county voters prior to

12 the County Board approving any zone change to facilitate housing in existing agricultural land

13 use designations in unincorporated areas. As result, residential development in unincorporated

14 areas of the County will be significantly more difficult through the duration of Measure E.

15 13. The County has contemplated the current iteration of the Project since at least

16 2012, when the County issued a request for proposals, seeking a master developer partner to

17 develop the Crows Landing Industrial Business Park. No master developer is currently

18 contemplated as part of the Project.

19 14. The Specific Plan identifies various land uses, including Aviation, Aviation-

20 compatible, Multimodal Access/Greenspace/Monument, Public Facilities, Logistics, Industrial,

21 and Business Park. These uses would be developed in three 10-year phases (i.e., 30 years) to

22 provide site development for approximately 14,000 to 15,000 jobs at full build-out and a

23 population of approximately 34,270 associated with those jobs.

24 15. On or about October 13, 2014, Respondents issued a notice of preparation
25 ("NOP") for the Project.

26 16. On or about January 22, 2018, Respondents issued a notice of availability of the

27 draft EIR ("Draft EIR"), with the comment period closing on March 12, 2018. Respondents then

28 issued a public notice extending the Draft EIR public review period on March 9, 2018. The Draft

(CW070795.2) 5

Churchwell White uP Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 EIR comment period formally closed on April 26, 2018.

2 17. On or about April 24, 2018, Newman submitted a comment letter to Respondents

3 on the Draft EIR, outlining several issues with the Draft EIR and its analysis, including traffic and

4 transportation, agricultural impacts, and aviation. The comment letter also identified the need to

5 consider the residential impact of the Project on the nearby municipalities.

6 18. On or about October 19, 2018, Respondents published the Final EIR, eight

7 appendixes to the Final EIR, amendments to the Specific Plan, and twelve appendixes to the

8 Specific Plan, totaling more than 1,500 pages, and issued a notice of public hearing to consider

9 certification of the Final EIR on October 30, 2018.

10 19. On October 29, 2018, Newman submitted an additional comment letter outlining

11 Newman's continued concerns with regard to the Project. The comment letter discussed the

12 Project's impacts on Newman's housing, transportation and the economic burden placed on

13 a Newman as a consequence of providing the additional housing units.

14 20. On or about October 30, 2018, Respondent Board of Supervisors held a public
15 meeting to consider and, over Petitioners' numerous objections, unanimously approved
16 certification of the Final EIR. During the public hearing to certify the Final EIR, the Board of
17 Supervisors made a minor concession to address Newman's traffic concerns by amending a

18 mitigation measure to require "cumulative fair-share basis [payment] in coordination with the

19 City of Newman" to address signalization along State Route 33.

20 21. On or about October 30, 2018, Respondents filed a notice of determination

21 ("NOD") with the Stanislaus County Clerk. Respondents filed the NOD prior to approving the

22 Specific Plan or any land use entitlements related to the Project.
23 22. On November 6, 2018, Respondents issued public notices for the Stanislaus

24 County Planning Commission and ALUC to consider recommending to the Board of Supervisors

25 approval of the necessary Project entitlements, including the Specific Plan, General Plan
26 Amendment, Rezone Application No. PLN2013-0091, and for the ALUC to approve Airport
27 Land Use Commission Application No. PLN2013-0091, at a meeting on November 15, 2018.

28

{CW070795.2} 6
Churchwell White uP Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

23. On November 15, 2018, the ALUC approved Airport Land Use Commission

2 Application No. PLN2013-0091 for the adoption of the Stanislaus County Airport Land Use

3 Compatibility Plan amendment.

4 24. On November 19, 2018, Respondents filed a second NOD following the ALUC's

5 adoption of the Stanislaus County Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan amendment.

6 25. On December 4, 2018, Respondent Board of Supervisors are scheduled to hold a

7 public meeting to consider approval of the Project entitlements, including the Specific Plan,

8 General Plan Amendment, and Rezone Application No. PLN2013-0091.

9 26. Newman brings this action to challenge the County's certification of the EIR, and

10 adoption of the amendment to the Stanislaus County Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan.

11 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES AND INADEQUACY OF REMEDY

12 27. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant

13 action and has exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by

14 law.

15 28. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
16 21167.5 by mailing written notice of this action to the Respondents. A copy of this written notice

17 and proof of service are attached hereto as Exhibit A.

18 29. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.6 by
19 concurrently filing request concerning preparation of the record of administrative proceedings

20 relating to this action.

21 30. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

22 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside their

23 certification of the EIR. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' approval will remain in

24 effect in violation of State law.

25 31. This action has been brought within 30 days of the filing of the NOD as required

26 by Public Resources Codes section 21167, subdivision (c). Respondents filed the first NOD on

27 the certification of the EIR with the County Clerk on October 30, 2018, even though no action

28 was taken relative to Project approval. Petitioner contends the October 30, 2018 NOD is defective,

{CW070795.2) 7
Churchwell White uo Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 but is filing this Petition within thirty (30) days of the posting of the first NOD to avoid any

2 statute of limitations challenge by Respondents. Respondents filed a second NOD on the ALUC

3 adoption of the Stanislaus County Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan amendment on November

4 19, 2018.

5 STANDING

6 32. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because

7 Petitioners' municipal services, public facilities, air quality, and transportation and traffic
8 infrastructure will be directly and adversely affected by Respondents' certification of the EIR.

9 ARBITRARY AND CAPRICOUS ACTIONS

10 33. Petitioner brings this action on the basis, among others, of Government Code

11 section 800, and other applicable laws, which awards Petitioner attorneys' fees in actions to

12 overturn agency decisions that are arbitrary and capricious, such as the decisions in question

13 herein.

14 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE

15 34. Petitioners bring this action as a private attorney general pursuant to Code of Civil

16 Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important rights

17 affecting the public. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a significant

18 benefit on a large class of persons by ensuring that Respondents do not certify an EIR, approve a

19 Project, and illegally expend public funds in the absence of lawful environmental review.

20 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

21 Abuse of Discretion - Mitigation Measures Are Not Enforceable As Required By CEQA (Violation of CEQA, Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)
22 35. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein, as if set forth in full, each and every

23 allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 34.

24 36. The Draft EIR states that the Project will generate additional traffic and degrade

25 levels of service ("LOS") at State Route 33 south of Stuhr Road, north of Newman, leading to a

26 significant impact. (Draft EIR, 3.14-18-19.) In response to these significant impacts, the EIR

27 focuses on contribution of its fair-share to road widening improvements on SR 33, south of Stuhr

28 Road and north of Newman, from two to four lanes. (Draft EIR, 5-35.) "However, the County

{CW070795.2} 8

Churchwell White -.: Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 cannot guarantee that these improvements would be implemented because they would be under

2 the jurisdiction of Caltrans and would depend on the availability and prioritization of State and

3 federal funds. There is no additional feasible mitigation available." (Draft EIR, 5-35.) Further, at

4 the October 30, 2018, Board of Supervisors public hearing to certify the EIR, the Board of

5 Supervisors, by motion, amended the EIR to state that "[t]he [P]roject shall contribute on a

6 cumulative fair-share basis, in coordination with the City of Newman, to signalization of the

7 following intersections: ... SR 33 intersections with Stuhr Road, Jensen Road, Yolo Street, and

8 Inyo Street." (See also, Final EIR, 2.3-14-10, 3-21.)

9 37. The proposed mitigation measure lacks a clear, enforceable commitment to a

10 mitigation program. In contrast, Appendix F of the EIR, the Transportation Infrastructure Plan,

11 provides several enforceable recommendations for mitigating the Project's impacts on traffic and

12 transportation. These recommendations include: establishment of a comprehensive strategy to

13 reduce solo occupant vehicle travel by employees, business vehicles including trucks, and

14 visitors; establishing a designated transportation demand management organization that requires

15 mandatory involvement by all companies within the Project and assigning a person representing

16 the Project on an ongoing basis to coordinate with individual businesses; requiring each

17 individual business within the Project to establish a designated transportation demand
18 management company representative; requiring the transportation demand management

19 organization to include annual mandatory employee surveys with required response rate of at

20 least 90 percent of employees; and requiring the transportation demand management company to

21 prepare an annual report indicating status of compliance with transportation demand management

22 goals established by the County. (Appendix F, 41-42.)

23 38. However, Newman nor Caltrans has not committed to make enough
24 improvements to accommodate buildout of the Project, buildout of the Newman General Plan,

25 and the Project's growth inducing impacts on population and housing. There is no substantial

26 evidence that Newman nor Caltrans are committed to scheduling the improvements in a way that

27 would timely mitigate the increase in vehicle traffic from the Project. Respondents cannot

28 abdicate their responsibility to analyze and mitigate significant impacts because certain

{CW070795.2) 9

Churchwell White w Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

r intersections are outside their jurisdiction. Respondents must analyze alternative mitigation

2 measures or commit itself to some enforceable mitigation measure.

3 39. As a mitigation measure, the Final EIR focuses on the County directing
4 | leaseholders, developers, and contractors to reimburse Newman its fair-share costs for off-site

5 transportation and traffic improvements and implementation of mitigation measures. (Final EIR,
6 2.3.6-48, 2.3.6-49.)

7 40. At its certification hearing, the Board amended the EIR mitigation measures to

8 include language that the County must consult with Newman to establish a fair share fee for

9 roadway impacts. At that same hearing, however, the Board and County Counsel noted that the

10 revised mitigation measure only required an effort to consult and did not necessarily require

11 agreement between the County and Newman or an enforceable fair share percentage that would
12 be attributable to development within the Specific Plan.

13 41. However, the EIR does not require leaseholders, developers, and contractors to

14 pay their fair-share of transportation and traffic improvement costs to Newman. The EIR merely

15 states that Respondents will facilitate the transfer of fair-share costs in coordination with Newman.

16 Agreeing to facilitate the transfer of funds is not the same a as a binding commitment. The EIR may

17 not rely on future mitigation measure that is not enforceable. The EIR fails to implement the

18 enforceable mitigation measures recommended in the Transportation Infrastructure Plan.

19 42. There is no commitment by Respondents to carry out an enforceable mitigation

20 measure, as recommended in the Transportation Infrastructure Plan. There is no evidence that

21 Respondents have committed to an enforceable mitigation plan involving the improvement or

22 maintenance of the various local roadways due to increased vehicle traffic that will be caused by

23 the Project. Thus, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by certifying the EIR and

24 approving the Project when it has not committed to sufficient enforceable mitigation measures.

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
Abuse of Discretion - Significant New Information
2 Required Recirculation of the EIR (Violation of CEQA, Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)
3

4 43. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein, as if set forth in full, each and every

5 allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 42,

6 A. Growth Induced Housing

7 44. In the Draft EIR, the discussion of growth inducing impacts is very short,

8 approximately one-page long. The Draft EIR discusses how the Project's approximately 14,000 to

9 15,000 jobs will lead to additional housing demand in the County and region. (Draft EIR, 5-43.)

10 However, the Draft EIR does not discuss where the additional housing demand may be located

11 and whether there is enough additional housing in the area to accommodate the job growth and

12 accompanying population growth.

13 45. The Final EIR estimates that 15,000 employees would generate a population of

14 approximately 34,270. (Final EIR, 2.2-5.) Assuming the County's current average household size,

15 11,200 new housing units would be needed to house the expected population growth. (Final EIR,
16 2.2-5.) The EIR proposes that the increased population growth is likely to locate in Newman,

17 Patterson, Turlock, and the County-wide unincorporated area. (Final EIR, 2.2-5.) The EIR states

18 that Newman, Patterson, Turlock, and the County-wide unincorporated area will develop enough

19 housing to fully accommodate the increased population growth. (Final EIR, 2.2-5.)

20 46. The EIR added significant new information regarding the Project's growth

21 inducing impacts, where that population growth may locate, and whether those areas have

22 housing capacity to accommodate that growth.

23 47. The addition of this significant new information without recirculating the EIR

24 deprived the public of meaningful opportunity to comment on substantial adverse project

25 impacts, feasible mitigation measures, or alternatives before certification of the EIR.

26 48. In particular, as discussed further below, Newman will be substantially harmed by

27 the Project's growth inducing impacts because Newman is one of the closest incorporated cities to

28 the Project. A significant portion of the Project's growth inducing impacts is likely to locate in

(CW070795.2) 11
Churchwell White P Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

Newman, including population growth and housing. Thus, Newman was wholly deprived of any

2 meaningful opportunity to comment on how the Project's growth inducing impacts will directly

3 affect them because the Draft EIR did not include this information.

4 B. Traffic Analysis

5 49. The Draft EIR provided no analysis of traffic impacts within Newman city limits.

6 While the Draft EIR mentions the intersection of State Route 33 and Stuhr Road, this intersection

7 is outside Newman city limits. (See e.g., Draft EIR, 3.14-19.) Newman raised the concern
regarding the EIR's failure to analyze traffic impacts within Newman city limits and the failure ot
explain the Project's fair-share basis in its April 24, 2018, comment letter. to

10 50. In response, the Final EIR included an updated Appendix A, the Transportation

11 Infrastructure Plan ("TIP"). For the first time, the TIP provided an analysis of three intersections

12 in Newman: State Route 33/Jenson Road, State Route 33/Yolo Street; State Route 33/Inyo Street.

13 (Final EIR, Appendix A, 36.) Further, the TIP concluded that the Project's fair share of these

14 impacts is 14 percent. (Final EIR, Appendix A, 36.)

15 51. As Newman raised in its comment letters, the Draft EIR failed to analyze traffic
16 impacts to Newman. Further, the Draft EIR did not accurately describe the Project's fair share

17 basis for traffic impacts to Newman. The updated TIP was the first time this information was

18 made available to Newman.

19 52. The addition of this significant new information without recirculating the EIR
20 deprived Newman and the general public of a meaningful opportunity to comment on substantial

21 adverse project impacts, feasible mitigation measures, or alternatives before certification of the

22 EIR.

23 53. Newman was deprived of any meaningful opportunity to comment on how the

24 Project's growth inducing impacts will directly affect them because the Draft EIR did not include

25 this information. 14 percent as the Project's fair share is woefully inadequate as a mitigation

26 measure considering the Project's growth inducing impacts. Had the Draft EIR included this
27 information, Newman would have raised numerous objections, provided additional information

28 for the County to consider, and called for the EIR to reanalyze its fair share.

(CW070795.2} 12
Churchwell White us Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 54. By failing to recirculate the EIR for additional comments based on the significant
2 new information regarding growth induced impacts and traffic added to the Final EIR,
3 Respondents have prejudicially abused their discretion in certifying the EIR and approving the
4 Project.

5 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

6 Abuse of Discretion - The EIR's Impact Analysis Is Insufficient (Violation of CEQA, Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)
7 55. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein, as if set forth in full, each and every
8 allegation contained in paragraphs through 54.

56. The EIR improperly assumes that local planning documents already account for
10 and accommodate the Project's growth inducing and cumulative impacts. However, the EIR fails
11 to recognize that local jurisdictions have projected their own growth separate and aside from the
12 Project's growth inducing impacts. An analysis of local growth and Project-induced growth,
13 taken and reviewed together, will reveal significant environmental impacts that have not been
14 analyzed by Respondents.

15 A. Growth Induced Housing

16 57. The EIR estimates that full buildout of the Project will result in the creation of
17 14,000 to 15,000 new jobs within the Specific Plan area. (Final EIR, 2.2-4.) Since approximately
18 44 percent of the County's total population is in the labor force, the EIR estimates that 15,000
19 employees would generate a population of approximately 34,270. (Final EIR, 2.2-5.) Assuming
20 the County's current average household size, 11,200 new housing units would be needed to house
21 the expected population growth. (Final EIR, 2.2-5.)

22 58. Patterson and Newman are the only two incorporated cities on the west side of
23 Stanislaus County. Each city is located near to the Project. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that
24 most of the Project's employees will relocate in Patterson and Newman, especially in light of the
25 Measure E development restrictions on unincorporated parts of the County.
26 59. The overarching objective for the Specific Plan is to provide high-quality
27 employment opportunities in the County; the EIR must analyze the Project consistent with its
28 objectives.

{CW070795.2) 13
Churchwell White 1? Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 60. Patterson currently has a population of approximately 22,100. Newman currently

2 has a population of approximately 11,300. Together Patterson and Newman have an approximate

3 population of 33,400. A population increase of 34,270 would more than double the current

4 populations of Patterson and Newman alone. While the EIR anticipates that population growth

5 will be spread between Patterson, Newman, Turlock and the unincorporated area, Patterson and

6 Newman will likely absorb a majority of the growth because they are the two closest incorporated

7 cities to the Project.

8 61. The EIR relies on County planning documents to state that the local community

9 sufficiently projects enough additional housing to accommodate for the Project's induced housing

10 needs. (Final EIR, 2.2-5.) Specifically, the Final EIR relies on the 2014 Regional Transportation

11 Plan and the Sustainable Communities Strategy's ("RTP/SCS") and 2014-2023 Stanislaus

12 Council of Governments ("StanCOG") Regional Housing Needs Plan ("RHNA").

13 62. The Final EIR cites the RTP/SCS forecast that 16,000 additional housing units

14 will be built in Patterson, Newman, and unincorporated areas between 2020 and 2040. (Final EIR,

15 2.2-5.) The Final EIR also cites the StanCOG RHNA to extrapolate data regarding how many
16 housing units will be built in the area during the Project's buildout. (Final EIR, 2.2-5.) Based on

17 this questionable methodology, the Final EIR estimates that 18,256 housing units will be built

18 between 2020 to 2040 in Newman, Patterson, Turlock, and the County-wide unincorporated area.

19 (Final EIR, 2.2-5.) Thus, the EIR concludes that the local community "will be planning for
20 housing in excess of what would be necessary to house employees of the Specific Plan Area."

21 (Final EIR, 2.2-5.)

22 63. The RTP/SCS and StanCOG RHNA, however, do not contemplate the Project and

23 its potential growth inducing impacts. The Project is not even discussed in those documents. The

24 Final EIR's conclusion that sufficient housing will be available to meet the Project's growth

25

26 1 The StanCOG RHNA is based on 10-year timeframe. However, the Final EIR uses the StanCOG RHNA numbers to calculate the number of housing units that will be built over 20-years. The StanCOG RHNA numbers do
27 not represent the best available methodology to calculate expected housing buildout over 20 years. Further, in this portion of the Final EIR, it discusses the Project's buildout over span of 20 years. However, the Draft EIR
28 specifically states that the Project is estimated to be built in three 10-year phases, over 30 years. The Project
is description is not consistent.

-

2 inducing impacts ignores the growth projections in the referenced studies and therefore is not

3 based on substantial evidence. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by certifying the

EIR.

4 64.

5 The Final EIR's flaw in relying on the local community to accommodate its

6 growth inducing impacts is further revealed when examining planning documents for Newman.

65.

7 The City of Newman adopted its most recent general plan amendments in 2007

8 and updated its housing element in 2016. The Newman General Plan and its housing element do

9 not discuss the Project, nor any growth inducing impacts that might result from the Project. The
Newman General Plan is focused on the city's own growth.

10 66.

11 Since the Newman General Plan does not discuss the Project, local growth is

12 projected to happen regardless of the Project. Thus, the EIR did not analyze any cumulative

13 impacts from Newman's projected growth together with the Project's growth inducing impacts.

14 Due to the cumulative impacts from the Project and local growth, there will not be adequate
housing to meet future demand in the area.

15 67.

16 While the local community may have forecasted additional housing demand due

17 to their own projected growth, the EIR falsely assumes that these growth forecasts take into
account the Project's induced growth. Local planning documents do not discuss the Project, nor
18 accommodate for the Project's induced growth. Thus, there is no substantial evidence to

19 support

20 the EIR's assumption that the local community has accounted for and will accommodate the
Project's growth inducing impacts.

21 68.

22 This failure is especially egregious when considered in the context of the property

23 tax implications of requiring Newman to address the housing of the Project without mitigating

24 any of the impacts from the growth the Project has induced. Newman will share the property

25 taxes for all new housing units on a basis of 70 percent to the County and 30 percent to Newman.

26 Thus, the failure to analyze and mitigate the growth inducing housing impacts of the Project

27 continues to impact Newman beyond just providing additional housing without any mitigation for
that service.

28 II/

{CW070795.2}
Churchwell White P 15

69. Further, it is an abuse of discretion for the EIR to rely on housing development in

2 the unincorporated arcas of the County. Following the adoption of Measure E, residential

3 development in the unincorporated areas of the County are substantially more difficult to approve

4 and less likely to be developed. No substantial evidence supports the finding that the

5 unincorporated areas of the County can support housing development for the Project's growth

6 inducing impacts. Respondents reliance on baseless assumptions in the EIR to approve the Project

7 entitlements is arbitrary and capricious.

8 B. Municipal Services

9 70. The Draft EIR incorrectly assumes that no additional schools, parks, recreational
10 facilities, or other public facilities (e.g., libraries) will be necessary because the Project does not

11 include residential development. (Draft EIR, 3.13-1, 5-28.) Further, the Draft EIR states that

12 "[t]he County has elected not to speculate as to whether there would be any population-related

13 cumulative impact related to schools, parks and recreational facilities, or other types of public

14 services and facilities to which the project could contribute." (Draft EIR, 5-29-30, emphasis in

15 original.)

16 71. The Project cannot assume that no additional schools, parks, recreational facilities,

17 and other public facilities will be necessary because the Project itself does not include residential

18 development. While the EIR need not speculate, it must analyze reasonably foreseeable impacts.
19 72. As the EIR admits, the Project's growth inducing impacts will result in direct

20 population growth of 34,270 residents to the local community. A significant amount of this

21 population growth will likely be concentrated in the two nearest incorporated cities of Patterson

22 and Newman. This population growth could double the current populations of Patterson and

23 Newman.

24 73. These new residents to the local community will cause an increase in intensity of

25 use to local schools, parks, recreational facilities, and other public facilities. Existing public

26 facilities will not be sufficient to accommodate all the new residents. Additional school facilities,

27 parks, recreational facilities, and other public facilities will need to be constructed to accommodate

28 the significant population increase and change in intensity of use of existing facilities.

{CW070795.2) 16
Churchwell White Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

74. In Stanislaus County, approximately 27.1 percent of the County is younger than

2 18 years old and thus of schooling age. Assuming the Project induced population growth will

3 have similar age characteristics, a population increase of 34,270 would also increase the school

4 age population by approximately 9,287.

5 75. The Patterson Joint Unified School District has an enrollment of approximately

6 5,500 students. The Newman-Crows Landing Unified School District has an enrollment of

7 approximately 3,000 students. The Patterson Joint and Newman-Crows Landing Unified School

8 Districts have a combined enrollment of 8,500 students-less than the estimated 9,000 Project-

9 related student population growth.

10 76. If a majority of the Project growth inducing student population were to attend

11 schools in Patterson Joint and Newman-Crows Landing Unified School Districts, school facilities

12 would have to effectively double. A significant amount of construction would be necessary to
13 double existing school facilities to accommodate the increased student population resulting from

14 Project-induced growth. This construction will lead to physical impacts on the environment,

15 including, but not limited to, dust and noise from construction activities. The EIR failed to
16 analyze these construction impacts related to building new school facilities. Further, increased

17 traffic resulting from trips to and from new school facilities were not analyzed. The Project

18 related growth impacts on local schools is not speculative. This is a clear and foreseeable impact

19 that the EIR must address but failed to analyze.

20 77. The EIR should have committed to enforceable mitigation measures to mitigate

21 impacts to local schools. For example, the EIR should have analyzed and required mitigation

22 measures such as a fair-share programs which require all future Project leaseholders, developers,

23 and contractors to contribute school fees.

24 78. Similarly, the increased population is likely to increase the intensity of use of

25 parks, recreational facilities, and other public facilities. The record contains no evidence of overall

26 usage or capacity of public facilities. Moreover, the EIR makes no attempt to determine the

27 current use of schools, parks, recreational facilities, or other public facilities by existing residents

28 or to extrapolate from such data estimated increased usage by an additional 34,270 residents.

{CW070795.2) 17
Churchwell White w Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 79. The EIR falsely assumes that the additional schools and public facilities necessary

2 to service the Project are speculative. These environmental impacts are clear and foreseeable. As

3 an informational document, the EIR failed to contain sufficient information to enable

4 Respondents to properly consider the Project's environmental consequences related to schools,

5 parks, recreational facilities, and other public facilities. By relying on the EIR to approve the

6 Project entitlements, Respondents have acted in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, and an

7 abuse of discretion.

8 C. Traffic

9 80. The Draft EIR analyzes the Project's traffic impacts in sections 3.14 and 5-30
10 through 5-36 and in Appendix F, the TIP, of the Draft EIR. The EIR's traffic analysis again

11 wrongly assumes that the Project's impacts to traffic are synonymous with local traffic patterns.

12 Thus, the EIR understates the Project's true impacts to traffic and transportation. The Final EIR

13 updates the TIP, provides an analysis of traffic within Newman city limits for the first time, and

14 estimates the Project's fair share for traffic impacts to Newman at 14 percent. (Final EIR,

15 Appendix A, 36.)

16 81. The EIR relies upon Newman's existing plans to implement signalization at State

17 Route 33 and Inyo Street, State Route 33 and Yolo Street, and State Route 33 and Jensen Road.

18 (Final EIR, Appendix A, 36.) Newman's plans to implement signalization were made before the

19 Project was proposed and the Project was not considered as part of Newman's expansion plans.
20 Consequently, it is not clear that the presently planned road expansions will be sufficient to serve

21 both Newman's and the Project's needs. No study has been done to determine if the proposed

22 expansion will provide the correct level of service given the Project's growth inducing impacts.

23 Further, there is no guarantee that Newman will these implement these signalization

24 improvements within the required timeframe to support the Project.

25 82. The EIR understates and underestimates the Project's traffic impacts to Newman.

26 By understating and underestimating the Project's traffic impacts on Newman, the EIR fails to

27 properly analyze the Project's environmental impacts and fails to commit to sufficient enforceable

28 mitigation measures.

(CW070795.2} 18
Churchwell White 4P Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 D. Air Quality

2 83. Chapter 3.2 of the Draft EIR discusses air quality impacts and focuses on impacts

3 from construction emissions, operational emissions, with operational emissions from mobile

4 sources limited to vehicle trips from "employees, visitors, and goods movement." (Draft EIR, 3.2-

5 28.)

6 84. The EIR fails to analyze additional air quality impacts from the Project's growth
7 inducing impacts. Particularly, the Project will increase the local population by approximately
8 34,270. While the EIR accounts for a portion of the population increase as employees of the
Project, the remaining portion of the population increase (e.g., spouses) and their impacts on air

10 quality are not discussed in the EIR.

11 85. The increased population will require the local community to engage in additional
12 construction activities, such as building schools, parks, recreational facilities, and improving

13 roads. The EIR failed to analyze these direct, foresecable impacts.

14 86. Moreover, the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District is in non-attainment

15 for several pollutants. By understating the additional air quality impacts from the Project's

16 growth there is no clear determination the additional amount of pollutants that will be released as

17 a consequence of the Project. This results in the Project's contribution to continued non-

18 attainment in the Basin unanalyzed and unmitigated.

19 87. The EIR understates and underestimates the Project's air quality impacts. The EIR

20 fails as an informational document. By relying on the EIR to approve the Project, Respondents

21 have prejudicially abused their discretion.

22 G. Greenhouse Gas Emissions

23 88. The Draft EIR concludes that the Project's greenhouse gas impacts will be
24 "cumulatively considerable."(Draft EIR, 3.7-16.) The Draft EIR analyzes greenhouse gas

25 emissions from construction-related emissions and operational emissions. (Draft EIR, 3.7-16-17.)

26 89. The EIR does not discuss analyzing greenhouse gas emissions associated with its

27 growth inducing impacts. Thus, the EIR underestimates and understates the Project's greenhouse

28 gas emissions. The EIR fails as an informational document. By relying on the EIR to approve the

{CW070795.2) 19
Churchwell White P Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

Project, Respondents have prejudicially abused their discretion.

2 90. The mitigation considered for these impacts focuses on Project specific approaches

3 rather than considering other available mitigation for greenhouse gas emissions such as offsets or

4 carbon trading programs. Despite this, the EIR finds that all greenhouse gas emissions impacts

5 that are cumulatively considerable are significant and unavailable.

6 H. Cumulative Impacts

7 91. The EIR underestimates the extent its growth inducing impacts will affect the
environment. Thus, the EIR failed to evaluate the true severity and significance of the cumulative

9 impacts from the Project. By understating information in the EIR, Respondents could not properly

10 consider and adopt appropriate and effective mitigation measures, skews its perspective

11 concerning the benefits of the particular project under consideration, and precludes it from

12 gaining a true perspective on the consequences of approving the Project. Thus, the EIR fails as an

13 informational document and Respondents abused their discretion by relying on the EIR to

14 approve the Project.

15 1. Growth Inducing Impacts

16 92. The Project is estimated to create 14,000 to 15,000 jobs and increase the local

17 population by approximately 34,270, which will require approximately 11,200 new residential

18 units. (Final EIR, 2.2-5.) The EIR assumes that the local community will develop enough housing
19 during Project buildout to accommodate the Project's growth inducing housing requirements.

20 (Final EIR, 2.2-5.) The EIR cites the StanCOG RTP/SCS to state that the County population

21 could increase by 37 percent and employment by 35 percent between 2008 and 2040. (Draft EIR,

22 5.30.) Thus, the EIR admits that the cumulative impact of regional growth could "require

23 additional facilities to be constructed, the construction of which could have potentially significant

24 impacts. This is a significant cumulative impact." (Draft EIR, 5-30.)

25 93. The EIR fails to consider that the StanCOG RTP/SCS does not consider the Project's

26 growth inducing impacts in its analysis. The Project will create additional population and

27 employment growth beyond what is projected in the RTP/SCS. Thus, the EIR underestimates and

28 understates its growth inducing impacts on the environment. Local forecasts of increases to

(CW070795.2) 20
Churchwell White P Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 population and employment could be substantially higher when the Project's growth inducing
2 impacts are taken into account along with other planned developments. The additional resources
3 and housing necessary to accommodate the extra population growth will be more than the EIR
4 estimated.

5 94. By understating and underestimating its growth inducing impacts, the EIR fails to

6 properly analyze the Project's environmental impacts and fails to commit to sufficient enforceable

7 mitigation measures.

8 2. Municipal Services

9 95. The Project is estimated to create 14,000 to 15,000 jobs and increase the local

10 population by approximately 34,270. Of the population growth, approximately 9,200 are
11 estimated to be school-aged children. This increase in population and school-aged children could
12 double the population of nearby Patterson and Newman and their respective school districts. The
13 increased population will also increase the intensity of use of parks, recreational facilities, and
14 other public services and facilities. To accommodate doubling its population and school
15 enrollment, Patterson and Newman will be forced to build new schools, parks, recreational

16 facilities, and other public services and facilities. However, the EIR elected not to speculate as to
17 such impacts on public services and recreation. (Draft EIR 5-29-30.)

18 96. Other planned developments in Patterson and Newman, such as Newman's Northwest
19 Master Plan area, will also increase the local population and school-aged children population.
20 These cumulative effects are not speculative. The EIR failed to analyze the Project's growth
21 inducing impacts with the impacts of other development in Stanislaus County on public services
22 and recreation. These cumulative impacts will be significant and must be mitigated. To mitigate
23 against these impacts to schools, parks, recreational facilities, and other public services and

24 facilities, the EIR should have analyzed establishing a public services and facilities demand

25 program and requiring all leaseholders, developers, and contractions to participate in the program
26 by paying their fair-share.

{CW070795.2} 21
Churchwell White 1P Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

3. Traffic

2 97. The EIR claims to have considered the impacts of the Newman General Plan buildout,

3 the Northwest Newman Master Plan, and Newman's traffic studies. (Final EIR, Appendix A, 36.)

4 To mitigate against the cumulative impacts of the Project on transportation and traffic
5 infrastructure, the EIR focuses on signalization within Newman. In particular, the EIR relies on

6 Newman's plans to implement signalization mitigation measures outside the County's jurisdiction

7 and within Newman.

8 98. Newman's plans to add signals to specific intersections were developed without

9 consideration of the Project's traffic impacts. Further, Newman's General Plan and signalization

10 projects do not take into account the additional traffic impacts generated by the Project's growth

11 inducing impacts.

12 99. The planned mitigation measures are insufficient to accommodate buildout of the

13 Newman General Plan, buildout of the Project, and the Project's growth inducing impacts on

14 population and traffic.

15 100. By failing to also analyze traffic related to the Project's growth inducing impacts,

16 the EIR grossly understates and underestimates the impact the Project will have on traffic and

17 transportation.

18 4. Air Quality

19 101. The EIR analyzed air quality impacts from the Project's construction and
20 operational emissions, with operational emissions focused on vehicle trips from "employees,

21 visitors, and goods movement." (Draft EIR, 3.2-28.)

22 102. The EIR does not analyze the cumulative air quality impacts from the Project, the

23 Project's growth inducing impacts, and buildout of Newman's General Plan. By failing to also

24 analyze air quality related to the Project's growth inducing impacts, the EIR understates and

25 underestimates the impact the Project will have on air quality.

1 5. Greenhouse Gas Emissions

2 103. The Draft EIR analyzes greenhouse gas emissions from construction-related
emissions and operational emissions. (Draft EIR, 3.7-16-17.) The cumulative impact analysis for
4 greenhouse gas emissions is four (4) sentences long. It concludes that the cumulative greenhouse
5 gas emissions are "cumulatively considerable" and that the impact is "significant and

6 unavoidable." (Draft EIR, 5-14.)

7 104. The EIR does not analyze the cumulative greenhouse gas emissions from the

8 Project, the Project's growth inducing impacts, and buildout of Newman's General Plan. By

9 failing to also analyze greenhouse gas emissions related to the Project's growth inducing impacts,
10 the EIR grossly understates and underestimates the impact the Project will have on greenhouse
11 gas emissions.

12 105. By understating and underestimating the Project's cumulative impacts, the EIR
13 fails to properly analyze the Project's environmental impacts and fails to commit to sufficient
14 enforceable mitigation measures.
