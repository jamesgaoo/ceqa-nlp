BUCHALTER
.PHONESSIONAL COAPORATINA Petitioner Oak Hill Park Company ("Petitioner" or "Oak Hill*) challenges the City
28 of Antioch (the "City") and its City Council's adoption of a developer-sponsored initiative as

BN 34134528v5 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE an

1 unlawful attempt to circumvent state law, relinquish the City's administrative authority, and
2 illegally vest development rights in a single private landowner so that it would have the right to
3| develop 1,177 dwelling units and a 5-acre mixed-use retail village center (the "Richland Ranch

4 Projcct") on an approximately 550-acre portion of the southern part of the City known as the

5 Sand Creck Focus Area. The Petition sponsors drafted an unlawful initiative designed to serve

6 the interests of Richland Communities, Inc. and Richland Planned Communities, Inc.
(collectively, "Richland Communities") at the cxpense of the other landowners in the western
8 Sand Creek Focus Arca without notifying them that their development potential had been
9 permanently taken away for Richland Communities' benefit.
10 2. In or about September and October 2015, Richland Communities submitted a
11| preliminary devclopment plan for the construction of a master planned community consisting of
12 1,667 residential dwelling units. In or about September 2016, Richland Communities submitted a
13| revised preliminary development plan, which included a "traditional" residential community of
14 1,118 residential dwelling units, or alternatively a community with an age-restricted residential
a 15 component with a total of 1,307 residential dwelling units.

16 3. In or about June 2017, Richland Communities submitted a formal application for
17| the development of the Richland Ranch Project. After receiving Richland Communities' formal
18 application, the City commenced its standard review process of the entitlement applications,
19 commencing the environmental review process by circulating a Notice of Preparation from
20 August 11, 2017 to September 11, 2017, holding a public scoping meeting on September 6, 2017,

21 and releasing a Draft Environmental Impact Report in or about March 2018.

22 4. The Draf Environmental Impact Report for the Richland Ranch Project indicates
23 that Richland Communities applied for General Plan text and map amendments, rezoning of the
24 project area from Study Area (S) to Planned Development (PD), design guidelines, a Resource
25 Management Plan, and a development agreement as part of the Richland Ranch Projcct.

26 5. A politically active contingent of Antioch residents and public interest groups
27 shortly thereafter expressed their opposition to Richland Communities' proposal, and began
28 gathering signatures for a voter initiative (the "Let Antioch Voters Decide Initiative) that would

BUCHALTER 2
GAS RANEIEO PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
BN 34134528v5

prohibit development of the Richland Ranch Project as well as development on surrounding lands
2 within the Sand Creek Focus Area.

3 6. To head off the Let Antioch Voters Decide Initiative and save the Richland Ranch
Project, Richland Communitics funded a competing voter initiative (the "Richland Ranch
Initiative"). The Richland Ranch Initiative purported to vest development rights for the Richland

6 Ranch Project while simultaneously prohibiting development on all adjacent property within the
7 western Sand Creek Focus Area, without providing notice to those adjacent property owners.

8 7. Both initiatives were submitted to the Contra Costa County Elections Department

9 with what was represonted to be sufficient signatures to qualify the measures for inclusion on the
10 November 2018 ballot.

11 8. Rather than submitting the initiatives to the voters, however, the City Council of

12 the City of Antioch ("City Council") pursued a series of actions that deprived the Antioch voters

13 of the right to decide on the future of the Sand Creek Focus Area:

14 a. On or about July 24, 2018, the City Council delayed consideration of the

15 Let Antioch Voters Decide Initiative thereby ensuring it would not qualify
16 for the November 2018 clection, by ordering staff to preparc a report
17| regarding the initiative's impacts.

181 b. The same day, the City Council adopted the Richland Ranch Initiative in
19 lieu of calling an election, effectively vesting development rights for the
20 Richland Ranch Project, without ordering staff to prepare a report on the
21 impacts of that initiative, without providing notice to adjacent property
22 owners who purportedly gave up their rights in a development agreement
23 approved by the same initiative, and without considering the environmental
24 impacts of its approval.

25 C. On or about August 28, 2018, after receiving the requested report from

26 staff that concluded the Let Antioch Voters Decide Initiative would have

27 little to no impact in light of the already-adopted Richland Ranch Initiative,

28 the City Council adopted the Let Antioch Voters Decide Initiative in lieu of

BUCHALTER 3
a lm PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
BN 34134528v5

1 an election. finding that the Let Antioch Voters Decide Initiative would

2 still allow for the development of the Richland Ranch Project.

3 9. As a result of this course of developer-sponsored actions, the City Council
approved Richland Communities' right to develop the Richland Ranch Project without following
5 the notice and hearing procedures that would otherwise apply to a major subdivision and
6 development project; it suspended the Richland Ranch Project environmental review process but

7 approved the project anyway; and blatantly volunteered adjacent property owner's land as open
8 space mitigation-without notifying some of these landowners-all so the Richland Ranch

9 Project could proceed.

10 10. By delaying adoption of the Let Antioch Voters Decide Initiative and adopting the
11 Richland Ranch Initiative first, the City Council subverted the purpose of the Let Antioch Voters
12 Decide Initiative "to protect [the Sand Creck Focus Area] lands before they are permanently
13 developed" (Let Antioch Voters Decide Initiative, Section 2(c)), misleading Antioch voters who
14 signed petitions for either initiative.
15 11. Independent of the sleight-of-hand procedures the City Council used to adopt these lo
16 initiatives, the Richland Ranch Initiative contains a number of critical legal defects:
17 a. The Richland Ranch Initiative unlawfully adopts a development agrecment
18 that vests rights in the Richland Ranch Project, which is fundamentally

19 inconsistent with the concept of a development agreement as negotiated

20 contract;

21 b. The Richland Ranch Initiative volunteers private property as environmental
22 mitigation for another landowner/devcloper's benefit without providing
23 notice to those affected property owners and without undertaking adequate
24 environmental review under the California Environmental Quality Act
25 ("CEQA"), California Public Resources Code Section 21000 et seq.;

26 C. To induce voters to sign the petition, the Richland Ranch Initiative, as well

27 as the petition and informational material shared with voters, misled voters
28 about the effects of the initiative by emphasizing provisions of the initiative

BUCHALTER 4
SAs IPANTEO PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
BN 34134528v5

that would limit development and reaffirm Antioch's Urban Limit Line and
2 de-cinphasizing the fact that the initiative would vest development rights
for the Richland Ranch Project.
4 d. The Richland Ranch Initiative amends portions of the City of Antioch's
General Plan which creates internal inconsistencies within the General

Plan;

C. By amending and authorizing the City Council to amend the Housing

8 Element without the prior review and approval of the Department of
Housing and Community Development ("HCD"), the Initiative voids the
10 HCD's prior certification of the City's Housing Element, thus jeopardizing
11 the City's right to receive millions of dollars in state transportation funding
12 from the Metropolitan Transportation Commission;

13 12. Because the City Council's adoption of the Richland Ranch Initiative not only
14 violated state law but constituted an unconstitutional taking on its face, Petitioner secks a writ of
15 mandate to prohibit the City of Antioch, its elected representatives, and its City departments from
16 implementing or enforcing the Richland Ranch Initiative and further seeks a judgment declaring 17 that the Richland Ranch Initiative constitutes an unlawful taking of property without just
18 compensation.
19 PARTIES

20 13. Petitioner and Plaintiff Oak Hill Park Company (*Petitioner" or "Oak Hill") is a

21 corporation formed under the laws of California. Oak Hill owns approximately 419.4 acres of
22 land comprising three tax parcels in the area affected by the Richland Ranch Initiative (Assessor's
23 Parcel Numbers 057-010-001-6, 057-010-004-0, and 057-060-006-4) (the "Oak Hill Property").

24 14. Respondent and Defendant City of Antioch ("City") is a general law, municipal
25 corporation, organized and existing under the laws of the State of California.

26 15. Respondent and Defendant City Council of the City of Antioch ("City Council") is
27 the duly elected legislative body of the City. The acts and omissions alleged herein were
28 undertaken by the City Council on bchalf of the City.

16. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon allege that Real Parties in Interest
Richland Communities, Inc., a corporation formed under the laws of Florida, and Richland

3 Planned Communities, Inc., corporation formed under the laws of California, are related
companies with the same or similar ownership interests, and own approximately 551.5 acres of

5 land comprising three tax parcels in the area affected by the Richland Ranch Initiative (Assessor's
Parcel Numbers 057-010-002-4, 057-010-003-2, 057-021-003-9) (the "Richland Ranch

Property").

17. Petitioner is currently unaware of the true names and capacities of

9 Respondents/Defendants and Real Parties in Interest sued herein as DOES 1 through 40,
10| inclusive, as the information concerning their identity is within the sole and exclusive control of
11 Respondents. Petitioner therefore sues those parties by such fictitious names. Petitioner is
12 informed and believed, and upon such information and belief allege, that DOES 1 through 40,
13 inclusive, are in some manner responsible for the conduct alleged in this Petition. Petitioner will
14| seek leave to amend this Petition to state the true names and capacities of the fictitiously named
15 parties when the same have been ascertained.
16 NATURE OF ACTION

17 18. This Petition is a facial challenge to the validity of the Richland Ranch Initiative
18 on the grounds that it violates state and federal law and the rights of affected landowners. The
19 Richland Ranch Initiative proclaims that its purpose is "in part to preserve and protect trees,
20| ridgelines, hillsides, and open space areas throughout the Sand Creek Focus Area west of Deer
21 Valley Road." In reality, it was a sneaky attempt by Richland Communities to take away the
22 development potential from their neighbors' properties so that their neighbors' land instead could
23 be sacrificed to save the Richland Ranch Project.

24 19. The unlawful Richland Ranch Initiative serves the interests of one landowner/
25 developer -Richland Communities-at the expense of neighboring landowners under the guise

26 of environmental protection, while further sacrificing the ability of the City to construct badly
27 needed housing, including senior housing, in an area planned for residential development for
28 decades.

20. In adopting the Richland Ranch Initiative, the City Council chose to violate to
2 numerous state laws, including state housing laws, planning and zoning laws, the California
3 Environmental Quality Act, and California election laws. These actions have resulted in a taking

4 from affected landowners, like Petitioner, whose property has suddenly become worthless so that

5 another developer can develop its project.

6 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

21. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this action pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure Sections 1060, 1085, and 1094.5.

22. The venuc is proper for filing this Petition in Contra Costa County pursuant to
10 Code of Civil Procedure Sections 394 and 395 because the City of Antioch is located within
11 Contra Costa County and the properties affected by the Richland Ranch Initiative are located in
12 Contra Costa County.
13 23. This action is exempt from the requirements of Government Code Section
14 65009(b), bccause there was no notice provided to Petitioner or other affected landowners under
15 Government Code Sections 65353 and 65355, and Petitioner had no knowledge that its property
16 could be affected, nor did Petitioner have the opportunity to object or to be heard, and/or to scek a
17| remedy.
18 24. Petitioner does not a have a plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law unless this
19 Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require the City to set aside its adoption of the
20 Richland Ranch Initiative.

21 STANDING

22
25. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims alleged in this Petition because it is
23

24 beneficially interested in this matter, as required by Code of Civil Procedure Section 1086.

25 Petitioner, whose real property is located within the jurisdiction of the City of Antioch, has a
direct and beneficial interest that is impacted by the Richland Ranch Initiative.
26
26. This action is exempt from the requirements of Government Code Section
27

5 the legislative body shall hold at least one public hearing," and that "[n]otice of the hearing shall
be given pursuant to section $5090." Petitioner had no knowledge that its property could be
affected and did not have the opportunity to object and/or seek an administrative remedy.

27. Unless the relief requested herein is granted, the Petitioner will be adversely
affected and injured by the City's implementation of the Richland Ranch Initiative.
10 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

14 the City's action on the Richland Ranch Initiative must be filed on or before October 22, 2018.
15 29. The statute of limitations for a challenge under the California Environmental
16 Quality Act on the grounds that the public agency has approved a project that may have e 17 significant effect on the cnvironment without having conducted environmental review and

21 Initiative must be filed on or beforc January 20, 2019.

22 30. This Petition was filed on or before October 22, 2018.

23 STATEMENT OF FACTS

24 31. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 30 of this
25 Petition as if set if forth herein in full.

26. 32. Since at least 2003, when the City adopted its current General Plan, the City has
27| outlined a vision for development of up to 4,000 residential dwelling units within the 2,712-acre
28 southern portion of the City known as the Sand Creek Focus Area. This vision seeks to balance

BUCHALTER
A PRTPASADINAS C3PP DP2A120% 8
SAS FHASEIMY PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
BN 34134528v5

the City's need for housing and employment opportunities with the preservation of important

2 natural resources.

3 33. Deer Valley Road separates the eastern and western portion of the Sand Creek

4 Focus Area. Significant development has occurred or has been approved and entitled in the
5 castern portion of the Sand Creek Focus Area while the western portion has not seen

6 development. The western Sand Creek Focus Area is divided into four major land holdings, and

7 these four areas are referred to as the Zeka Property, the Richland Ranch Property, the Oak Hill
8 Property, and the Leung Property.

34. Petitioner's property, the Oak Hill Property, is located within the City and is
10 currently vacant. It is located within the western portion of the Sand Creek Focus Area, and is
11 also within the area of land affected by both the Let Antioch Voters Decide Initiative and the

12 Richland Ranch Initiative.

13 35. In June 2017, Richland Communities submitted an application to develop the
14 Richland Ranch Property with the proposed Richland Ranch Project, a master planned
15| community including two scenarios: a multi-generational plan with 1,307 residential dwelling
16 units, and a traditional plan with 1,137 residential dwelling units. Entitlements sought for the
17 Richland Ranch Project include General Plan text and map amendments, rezoning of the project

18 area from Study Area (S) to Planned Development (PD), design guidelines, a Resource
19 Management Plan, and a development agreement.

20 36. After receiving Richland Communities' formal application, the City commenced

21 the environmental review process by circulating a Notice of Preparation from August 11, 2017 to

22 September 11, 2017, holding a public scoping meeting on September 6, 2017, and releasing a
23| Draft Environmental Impact Report in or about March 2018. However, the City ultimately
24 abandoned the environmental review process and never certified the Final EIR.

25 37. In lieu of following the procedures for project approval that would ordinarily apply

26 to master planned development projects in the City, on or about June 4, 2018, Richland
27 Communities submitted the Richland Ranch Initiative petition to the City Clerk of the City of
28 Antioch, along with what it represented to be approximately 7,978 signatures from voters in the

BUCHALTER
CoxPORA: 9

Dax FNatearD PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
BN 34134528v5

City of Antioch.

38. Neither Richland Ranch nor the City notified the potentially affected landowners

3 that they were subject to the Richland Ranch Initiative.

39. The City Clerk's office thereafter submitted the Richland Ranch Initiative petition,
5 and the signatures, to the Contra Costa County Clerk Recorder Elections Division for

6 verification of signatures.

40. The Antioch City Attorney's impartial summary of the purpose and provisions of
the Richland Ranch Initiativc states that the initiative would amend the Antioch General Plan to
establish two overlay land use designations-a 1,244-acre "Restricted Development Arca" and a
10 608-acre "Limited Development Area". -on 1,852 acres of land in the Sand Creck Focus Area

11 west of Deer Valley Road; would allow only certain limited uses on parcels no smaller than 80
12| acres within the Restricted Development Arca; and would allow development of the Richland
13 Ranch Project within the Limited Development Area with up to 1,177 single-family residential
14 dwelling units.
15 41. On or about July 24, 2018, without notice to potentially affected landowners other
16 than Richland, the City Council unanimously adopted Resolution No. 2018/93 to approve
17 enacting the Richland Ranch Initiative. The City Council declined to submit the Richland Ranch
18 Initiative to the voters under Elections Code § 1405(b). A copy of the Richland Ranch Initiative
19 as adopted by the City Council is attached to this Petition as Exhibit A.
20 42. There was no review of the Richland Ranch Initiative by state or local planning or

21 housing agencics.

22 43. The City started but never completed environmental review for the Richland
23 Ranch Project as it was approved in the Richland Ranch Initiative.
24 44. Prior to the City Council adopting the Richland Ranch Initiative, the City of
25 Antioch General Plan designated Petitioner's Oak Hill Property for Golf Course Community,
26 Senior Housing, and Open Space, as a part of the Sand Creek Focus Area, which allowed for a
27| maximum of 4,000 dwelling units across the focus area and encouraged single-family detached
28 and small lot single family units fronting a golf course at density of four dwelling units per acre
BUCHALTER

MOAFION 10
VAa fzatara PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
BN 34134528v5

in addition to ag-restricted senior housing. Before the Richland Ranch Initiative, the Gencral

2 Plan would have allowed up to a maximum of approximately 1,000 dwelling units on the portion
of the Oak Hill Property designated Golf Course/Senior Housing/Open Space.

45. After the Council adopted the Richland Ranch Initiative, the Golf Course/Senior
• Housing/Open Space land use category was deleted from the General Plan and removed from
Petitioner's Oak Hill Property. The Oak Hill Property was re-designated to "Rural Residential,
Agriculture, Open Space," new land use designation which reduces the development potential

8 of the Oak Hill Property to, at the very maximum, 5 dwelling units, 0.0125 dwelling units per
acre, or 0.3% of its prior development potential.
10 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

11 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

12 Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1085 and 1094.5

13 Violation of California Development Agreement Law Government Code § 65864 et seq.
14 (Against all Respondents and Does 1-40, Inclusive)
15 46. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference into its First Cause of Action
16 paragraphs 1 through 45 of this Petition as if set forth herein in full.
17 47. The California Legislature prohibits local initiatives when it cxclusively delegates
18 a task to a local governing body. The California Legislature has delegated the task of entering into
19| development agreements exclusively to the City Council, not to the electorate, via the initiative
20 process. California's Development Agreement Law is a matter of statewide concern, enacted to
21 address a statewide impediment to land use development, and thus the intent to exclude ballot
22 measures adopting development agreements is more readily inferred. (Committee of Seven
23| Thousand v. Superior Court (1988) 45 Cal.3d 491, 501.)

24 48. Section 7 of the Richland Ranch Initiative attempts to adopt a development
25 agreement by resolution as an ordinance between the City and "the holders of legal or equitable
26 interests in the real property" that encompasses the Richland Ranch Project.
27 49. The language and structure of California's Development Agreement Statute,
28 Government Code Section 65864 et seq., demonstrate that the initiative process is inconsistent

BUCHAInER
. PSOIEMOS 11
SAN FHASTN PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
BN 34134528v5

with the fundamental concept of a development agreement as a negotiated contract. (Sec Center

2 for Community Action & Environmental Justice v. City of Moreno Valley (2018) 26 Cal.App.5th

3 689, 707.) The Development Agreement Law contemplates negotiation between a local
government and developer. The initiativc process precludes negotiation by prohibiting changes

5 during considcration or after adoption. Further, by prohibiting modification, adoption of

6 development agreement by initiative prevents the City from ensuring its compliance with the
7 statutory provisions contained in the Development Agreement Statute.

8 50. California's Development Agreemênt Statute states that a devclopment agreement
9 is a "legislative act" that is adopted by ordinance and "subject to referendum." (Gov. Code §
10 65867.5.) By choosing to reference the referendum power, and excluding the initiative power, the
11| California Legislature makes clear that the Development Agreement Law prohibits the adoption
12| of development agreements through initiative and requires the City Council to negotiate
13| development agreements. (Center for Community Action & Environmental Justice v. City of
14| Moreno Valley (2018) 26 Cal.App.5th 689, 699.)
15 51. This misuse of the initiative process to adopt a development agreement has
16 allowed Richland Communities to obtain a significant financial gain simply by having 10% of the
17 electorate sign an initiative petition, running afoul of California's statutes governing development
18| agreements and violating state constitutional protections aimed at preventing private corporations
19 from using the initiative process for personal financial benefit.
20| 52. Based on these facts, the City violated California law by adopting the Richland

4 Violation of California Development Agreement Law Government Code 65867.5.
5 (Against all Respondents and Does 1-40, Inclusive)

6 53. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference into its Second Cause of Action
paragraphs 1 through 52 of this Petition as if set forth herein in full.

8 54. California's Development Agreement Law states that a development agreement is
a "legislative act" that is "subject to referendum." (Gov. Code § 65867.5.) Under Government
10| Code Section 65867.5, a development agreement, as with other legislative acts, must be adopted

11 by ordinance, not resolution.
12 55. Section 7 of the Richland Ranch Initiative attempts to adopt a development
13 agreement between the City and "the holders of legal or equitable interests in the real property"
14 that encompasses the Richland Ranch Project. 15 56. On July 24, 2018, when the City Council was considering whether to adopt the
16 Richland Ranch Initiative or to submit the initiative to the voters, Councilmember Ogorchock
17 moved to adopt a "resolution of the City Council of the City of Antioch approving and enacting
18 the initiative to restrict development in portions of the sand creek area, approve a development
19 agreement for "The Ranch" project in that area, and allow amendment of the urban limit line by
20| voter approval only."
21 57. The City Council adopted the resolution, Resolution No. 2018/93, unanimously.

22 58. The City Council did not consider by separate motion an ordinance enacting the

23 Richland Ranch Initiative.

24 59. Section 7 of the Richland Ranch Initiative stated, "the Development Agreement is
25 hereby adopted as an ordinance" cven though the City Council adopted it by resolution. Just
26 because the Council said it was an ordinance did not make it an ordinance (see Resolution No.

27 2018/93). A voter initiative may not do that which the City itself is not permitted to do.

8 Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1085 and 1094.5
Violation of Cal. Const., art. II § 12
10 (Against all Respondents and Does 1-40, Inclusive)

11 62. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference into its Third Cause of Action
12 paragraphs 1 through 61 of this Petition as if set forth herein in full.

13 63. The California Constitution states that "No ... . statute proposed to the clectors . . .
14 by initiative, that . . names or identifics any private corporation to perform any function or to
15| have any power or duty, may be submitted to the electors or have any effect."

16 64. The City Council violated this Constitutional provision when it approved the
17 Richland Ranch Initiative because the ordinance confers vested rights directly to Richland
18 Communities to develop the Richland Ranch Project.
19 65. Exhibit G to the Richland Ranch Initiative, the Development Agreement, identifies
20 "the holder of a legal or equitable interest" to "an approximately 551.5-acre portion of the Sand

21 Creek Focus Area in the City" as parties to the Development Agreement. The Development
22 Agreement confers special privilege and advantage on this private entity, Richland Communities.

23 66. The City Council, when it adopted the Richland Ranch Initiative, was aware that
24 Richland Communities was the party who would receive special privilege under the Richland
25 Ranch Initiative.

26 67. By adopting the Richland Ranch Initiative, which includes adoption of the
27 Development Agreement, the City violated the California Constitution. On the basis of these
28 violations, Petitioner secks the issuance of a writ of mandate commanding the City to set aside

68. Petitioner hereby incorporatcs by reference into its Fourth Cause of Action
10 paragraphs 1 through 67 of this Petition as if set forth herein in full.
11 69. A City a may "enter into a development agreement with any person having a legal or
12 equitable interest in real property for the development of property . . . ." Gov. Code § 65865(a).
13 By definition an agreement must have a second party, and an agreement lacking a second party
14 violates contract law. Civ. Code § 1550 ("It is essential to the existence of a contract that there
15 should be: (1) Parties capable of contracting"); Klajic v. Castaic Lake Water Agency (2001) 90
16 Cal.App.4th 987, 997 (*[T]here must be at least two parties to a contract.")

70. The Richland Ranch Initiative intentionally docs not name the other party entering
18| into the Development Agreement with the City, instead referring to the "the holder of a legal or
19 equitable interest" to "an approximately 551.5-acre portion of the Sand Creck Focus Area in the
20 City" as parties to the Development Agreement.

21 71. A unilateral development agreement, which inserts a party or partics after a certain
22 date, is not a valid contract. The Development Agreement Law requires a City to enter into an

23 agreement with another contracting person or entity.

24 72. A voter initiative may not do that which the City itself is not permitted to do.
25 (Legislature v. Deukmejian (1983) 34 Cal.3d 658, 674-75.)

6 Improper Subject Matter for Initiative in Violation of Cal. Const., art. II, 8.

7 (Against all Respondents and Does 1-40, Inclusive)

8 74. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference into its Fifth Cause of Action
paragraphs 1 through 73 of this Petition as if set forth herein in full.
10 75. California Constitution, Article II, Section 8(a) provides that "[t]he initiative is the

11 power of the electors to propose statutes and amendments to the Constitution and to adopt or
12| reject them." In California, the powers of initiative and referendum apply only to acts which are
13 legislative in character, and do not extend to administrative actions. (Am. Fed'n of Labor v. Eu
14 (1984) 36 Cal.3d 687, 695; Simpson v. Hite (1950) 36 Cal.2d 125, 129.)

15 76. Legislative acts are those involving the adoption of broad and generally applicable
16 rulcs; Actions affecting an individual, based on certain facts in an individualized casc, on the
17| other hand, are referred to as adjudicatory acts. (Horn v. County of Ventura (1979) 24 Cal.3d
18 605, 613.) The administrative acts that follow from a legislative policy are not subject to
19 referendum or initiative. (See Andrews v. City of San Bernardino (1959) 175 Cal.App.2d 459,
20 463.)

21 77. The Richland Ranch Initiative exceeded the scope of initiative and referendum
22 authority by restricting the City's planning commission and City Council from implementing
23 already-approved legislative policies as set forth in the General Plan.

24 78. First, the Richland Ranch Initiative, Section 3, directly adopts findings that the

25 Richland Ranch Project is consistent with the Antioch General Plan, which intrudes into the
26 City's powers to determine administratively whether the proposal is consistent with the General
27 Plan. (Guardians of Turlock's Integrity v. Turlock City Council (1983) 149 Cal.App3d 584.) The
28 incorporation of adjudicative findings into an initiative provides no assurances that the land use

BUCHALTER

FRANCISTP PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

decision making process "bridges the analytic gap between the raw evidence and ultimate
2 decision or order" or complies with the legislative policies that govern permit-level decision-

3 a making. (Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles (1974) 11 Cal.3d 506,

4 515.)

5 79. Second, the Richland Ranch Initiative, Section 6(C), adds to the Antioch Zoning
6 Code new Articlc 42 ("West Sand Creek Planned Development District"), which unlawfully
converts discretionary permits and approvals ordinarily required for a development of the

8 magnitude of the Richland Ranch Project into ministerially approved permits. Article 42 requires
9 that any future development applications for the Richland Ranch Project be ministerially granted.
10 By establishing a development review process for a specific project that deviates dramatically
11| from the normal permit process and takes away the power of the City Council to administratively
12| review the Richland Ranch Project, the Richland Ranch Initiative impermissibly intrudes upon
13 the administrative authority granted to the City.
14 80. Third, the Richland Ranch Initiative vests development rights through the adoption
15 of a Devclopment Agreement for the Richland Ranch Project, which also impermissibly intrudes

16 upon the City's administrative authority to engage in negotiation of development agreements.
17 81. On the basis of the foregoing violations of state law, Petitioner seeks the issuanco
18 of an alternative and peremptory writ of mandate commanding Respondents to set aside and void
19 their adoption of the Richland Ranch Initiative, and enjoining the implementation or enforcement
20 of the Richland Ranch Initiative.

107. The formulation of mitigation measures under CEQA is a discretionary act.
(Ocean Harbor House Homeowners Ass'n v. California Coastal Comm. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th
215, 242.)

108. An initiative that incorporates mitigation measures unlawfully impairs the
6 discretion that CEQA mandates be exercised by local agencies. (See, e.g., City of San Diego V.
Dunkl (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 384, 402.

8 109. Section 8 of the Richland Ranch Initiative seeks to impose mitigation measures on
9 the Richland Ranch Project that may or may not mitigate significant environmental impacts of the
10 project without completing the CEQA process.
11 110. Further, Section 6(C) of the Richland Ranch Initiative adds to the Antioch Zoning

114. CEQA requires all lead agencies to prepare an environmental impact report

2 ("EIR") on any project that they intend to carry out or approve which may have a significant
3 cffect on the environment. (Pub. Res. Code 21151.)

115. Under CEQA, a "project" includes an activity involving the issuance of "an

5 entitlement for use by one or more public agency." (Pub. Res. Code § 21065(c).)

6 116. A public agency is required to conduct environmental review leading to an EIR (or
a negative declaration) before carrying out or committing to the implementation of a project.

8 (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21080(c), 21151, 21061.)

9 117. The term "approval" as used in CEQA means the decision by a public agency
10 which commits the agency to a definite course of action in regard to a project intended to be
11 carried out by any person. With private projects, approval occurs upon the earliest commitment to
12 issue a discretionary entitlement for the project. (CEQA Guidelines 15352.)
13 118. The approval of a development agreement is subject to review even though the
14 final approval of the development agreement may be conditioned on the outcome of a vote by the
15| clectorate.

16 119. The City committed to the issuance of discretionary approvals for the Richland
17| Ranch Project before it started negotiating a development agreement with Richland Communities
18 for the Richland Ranch Project.

19 120. The City failed, however, to procced in the manner required by law by adopting a
20 development agreement through the Richland Ranch Initiative prior to conducting and completing
21| environmental review of the development agreement so that it could terminate its obligations
22 under CEQA. (See e.g., Citizens for Responsible Government v. City of Albany (1997) 56
23 Cal.App.4th 1199; Fullerton Joint Union High School Dist. v. State Bd. of Education (1982) 32
24 Cal.3d 779.).

25 121. As a result of the City's action, Richland Communities would appear to have

8 123. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference into its Eleventh Cause of Action
9 paragraphs 1 through 122 of this Petition as if set forth herein in full.

10 124. CEQA requires the lead agency for a project to respond to comments received
11| during the Draft EIR circulation period, describing the disposition of any significant
12 environmental issues raised and explaining in detail the reason for not accepting any specific
13 comments concerning major environmental issues. These comments are then incorporated into a
14 Final EIR, which is to be prepared and presented to the decision-making body of the lead agency
15 for its review and consideration before approving project.

16 125. If a decision-making body elects to proceed with a project that would have
17 unavoidable significant impacts, then a Statement of Overriding Considerations explaining the
18 decision to balance the benefits of the project against unavoidable environmental impacts must be
19 prepared.
20 126. On-or about August 11, 2017, the City issued a Notice of Preparation of a Draft
21 Environmental Impact Report for the Richland Ranch Project. The Notice states that the City will

22 act as the lead agency responsible under CEQA for evaluating the environmental impacts of the
23 Richland Ranch Project. The Notice of Preparation is attached hereto as Exhibit B.

24 127. The Notice of Preparation describes the Richland Ranch Project as proposal to
25 amend the general plan and construct 1,307 low-density, active adult, and medium-density
26 residential dwelling units, various facilities and amenities, and circulation and access
27 improvements, as well as associated infrastructure improvements to serve the proposed planned
28 community. (Noticc of Preparation, p. 2.)

BUCHALTER

128. The Notice of Preparation further states that the City has reviewed the proposed
project application and has determined that an EIR should be prepared for the proposed project
because it may have a significant effect on the environmont. (Notice of Preparation, p. 6.) It then
lists the following potential project-related impacts: air quality and greenhouse gas emissions,
biological resources, cultural resources, geology and soils/mineral resources, hazards and
hazardous materials, hydrology and water quality, land use and planning/population and housing,
noise, public services, recreation, and utilities, transportation and circulation, and alternatives

8 analysis. (Notice of Preparation, p 7.)

129. The City caused a Draft EIR for the Richland Ranch Project to be prepared, and
10| the City circulated the Draft EIR from March 13, 2018 to May 14, 2018.
11 130. The Draft EIR found that the Richland Ranch Project would have significant and
12| unavoidable impacts relating to the degradation of visual character, air quality emissions,
13| greenhouse gas emissions, and traffic.
14 131. The Draft EIR further concluded the proposed project would require adoption of a
15 Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program (*MMRP") that specifies the methods for
16 monitoring mitigation measures required to eliminate or reduce the project's significant effects on 2 5 0 the environment to a less-than-significant level. The Draft EIR included mitigation measures
pertaining to aesthetics, air quality and greenhouse gas emissions, biological resources, cultural
19 resources, geology, soils, and mineral resources, hazards and hazardous materials, hydrology and
20 water quality, noise, and transportation and circulation.
21 132. Despite having started the environmental review process for the Richland Ranch
22 Project, the City terminated its environmental review process when it became aware of the Let
23 Antioch Voters Decide Initiative.

24 133. When the City considered adopting the Richland Ranch Initiative, it did not
25 undertake any environmental review for the Richland Ranch Initiative or consider whether the
26 environmental review that the City previously commenced for the Richland Ranch Project
27| adequately encompassed the scope of environmental impacts of the project covered in the
28 Richland Ranch Initiative - even though the development project changed. Instead, the City
24 BUCHALTER

Sas FP 10.25/ PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
BN 34134528v5

stated that it would comply with CEQA later, prior to subdivision approval. (See Section 6,

2 subsection (A)(2), of the Richland Ranch Initiative.)

3 134. The Richland Ranch Initiative precludes comprehensive evaluation of
environmental impacts by committing the City to a specified course of action prior to

5 environmental review under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA").

6 135. The City's failure to respond to comments on the Draft EIR, failure to prepare d

Final EIR, and failure to certify the Final EIR before approving the devclopment agreement

8 constitutes prejudicial abuse of discretion in that the City failed to proceed in the manner

9 required by law by adopting development agreement through the Richland Ranch Initiative so
10 that it could blatantly ignore its obligations under CEQA. (Sce e.g., Citizens for Responsible
11 Government v. City of Albany 56 Cal.App.4th 1199).

12 136. Construction of the Richland Ranch Project will irreparably harm the environment
13 by substantially degrading the cxisting visual character of the Richland Ranch Property;
14 generating long-term operational criteria air pollutant emissions and cumulatively considerable
15| contributions to greenhouse gas emissions; having adverse impacts on special-status plant

13 138. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference into its Twelfth Cause of Action
14 paragraphs 1 through 137 of this Petition as if set forth herein in full.
15 139. CEQA requires that an EIR propose and describe feasible mitigation measures to
16 minimize a project's significant environmental effects as identified in the EIR. (Pub. Res. Code §
17 21100(b)(3); 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15121(a).)

18 140. An EIR should focus on mitigation measures that are feasible, practical, and
19 effective. (Napa Citizens for Honest Gov't v. Napa County Bd. of Supervisors (2001) 91
20 Cal.App.4th 342, 365.) Mitigation measures must be fully enforccable through permit conditions,
21| agreement, or other legally-binding instruments. (Pub. Res. Code § 21081.6(b); 14 Cal. Code
22 Regs. § 15126.4(a)(2).)

23 141. Mitigation measures must be consistent with all applicable constitutional
24| requirements, including that there must be an essential nexus between the mitigation measure and
25 a legitimate governmental interest, and the mitigation measure must be roughly proportional to
26| the impacts of the project. (14 Cal.Code Regs. § 15126.4(a)(4); Nollan v. California Coastal
27 Commission (1987) 483 U.S. 825, 837; Dolan v. City of Tigard (1994) 512 U.S. 374, 390.)

BUCHALTER
A PROPIIURAI COSPORAIION 26

Petitioner is informed and believes and alleges based on that information and belief that the City
2 redesignated Petitioners' land to "Rural Residential, Agriculture, Open Space" under the pretense
3| of sacrificing it so that the City Council could prohibit development on Petitioner's land so as to

4 approve the Richland Ranch Project. The City Council did this without telling Petitioner or any of
the other landowners that their properties would now effectively be open space mitigation for the
6 impacts of development of the Richland Ranch Project.

143. The use of Petitioners' private land is not a proper mitigation measure. Use of

8 somcone else's private land for mitigation of a different project constitutes an unlawful taking of
Petitioner's land, and therefore is not a mitigation measure that can be legally imposed.

10 144. The City's blatant use of Petitioners' land as open spacc for the Richland Ranch
11| Project is not supported by substantial evidence. (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168, 21168.5; Gray v.
12| County of Madera (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1099, 1116.)
13 145. Because Petitioner's private land cannot be used to mitigate the environmental
14 impacts of the Richland Ranch Project, the City has not properly evaluated and applied mitigation
15 measures to minimize, reduce, or avoid the significant environmental impacts of the Richland
16 Ranch Project.

17 146. On the basis of these violations, Petitioner seeks the issuance of a writ of mandate
18 commanding the City to set aside and void its adoption of the Richland Ranch Initiative, and
19| enjoining the implementation and enforcement of the Richland Ranch Initiative.

3 149, Section 8 of the Richland Ranch Initiative seeks to impose mitigation measures on
the Richland Ranch Project. Such mitigation measures fail to constitute legislation and the

5 approval of the mitigation measurcs as conditions does not constituto a lcgislative act. CEQA
6 mitigation measures involve the "application of general standards to specific parcels of real

20| paragraphs 1 through 150 of this Petition as if set forth herein in full.

21 152. California Elections Code Section 18600 prohibits the making of intentionally
22 false representations concerning the contents, purport, or effect of an initiative with the intent to
23 induce a voter into signing the petition.

24 153. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges that the Richland Ranch
25 Initiative petition and informational material provided to voters contained false and misleading
26 statements concerning the reasons for the Richland Ranch Initiative in order to induce voters to
27 sign the petition. The false and misleading statements included presenting the Richland Ranch
28 Initiative as a measure whose primary purpose was to strengthen the City Urban Limit Line,

while not informing voters of its true purpose to adopt a development agreement that would vest

3 154. As a result of these false and misleading statements, the City and the City Council
4 had a ministerial duty not to adopt the Richland Ranch Initiative or place it before the voters. (San
5 Francisco Forty-Niners v. Nishioka (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 637.)

6 155. By adopting the Richland Ranch Initiative, the City and City Council violated its
ministerial duty to reject the Richland Ranch Initiative. On the basis of these violations of state
8 law, Petitioner seeks the issuance of a writ of mandate commanding the City to set aside and void
its adoption of the Richland Ranch Initiative, and enjoining the implementation and enforcement
10 of the Richland Ranch Initiative.

16 156. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference into its Fifteenth Cause of Action
17 paragraphs 1 through 155 of this Petition as if set forth herein in full.
18 157. On July 24, 2018, when the City Council was considering whether to adopt the
19 Richland Ranch Initiative or to submit the initiative to the voters, Councilmember Ogorchock
20 moved to adopt a "resolution of the City Council of the City of Antioch approving and enacting

21 the initiative to restrict development in portions of the sand creek area, approve a devclopment

22 agreement for "The Ranch" project in that area, and allow amendment of the urban limit line by

23 voter approval only."

24 158. The City Council adopted the resolution, Resolution No. 2018/93, unanimously.

25 159. The City Council did not consider by separate motion an ordinance enacting the
26 Richland Ranch Initiative.

27 160. California Elections Code section 9215 requires that if an initiative petition

14 paragraphs 1 through 161 of this Petition as if set forth herein in full.
15 163. Government Code Scction 65300.5 requires that a general plan and its elements
16 and parts must comprise an "integrated, internally consistent and compatible statement of
17| policies."

18 164. Section 5 of the Richland Ranch Initiative provides for amendments to the Antioch

20 Growth Management Element, Land Use Element, Community Image and Design Element,

21 Economic Development Element, Circulation Element, Public Services and Facilities Element,
22 the Housing Element, the Resource Management Element, Environmental Hazards Elcment, the

23 and the Implementation Element.

24 165. The Richland Ranch Initiative creates impermissible inconsistencies in the Antioch
25| General Plan including, but not limited to, the following:

26 a. The Richland Ranch Initiative amends Section 3.5 of the General Plan to

27 prohibit the City from extending or supporting the extension of urban
28 facilities---including fire protection services, police services, water storage

BN 34134528vS

and distribution, sanitary sewer collection and treatment, flood control,

2 parks and recreational facilities, and school services-outside the Urban

3 Limit Line. This is in direct conflict with Section 4.4.6.9 of the General
Plan, land use guidelines for the Roddy Ranch focus area, which envisions

5 the development of water, sewer, drainage, and other utility systems from

6 scratch, including into areas outside the Urban Limit Line, and requires

7 performance standards for police and fire to bc met through all phases of

8 development.

b. The Richland Ranch Initiative's amendments to Section 3.5 of the General
10 Plan also create internal inconsistencies with Section 4.4.6.10 of the
11 General Plan, land use guidelines for the Ginochio Property, which
12 envisions the development of water, sewer, drainage, and other utility
13 systems from scratch, including into areas outside the Urban Limit Line,
14 and requires performance standards for police and fire to be met through all
15 phases of development. Section 4.4.6.10 also envisions new school
16 facilities within the Ginochio Property, in conflict with the prohibition on
17 extension of school services outside the ULL contained in the Richland
18 Ranch Initiative's amendments to Section 3.5 of the General Plan.
19 C. The Richland Ranch Initiative's amendments to Section 3.5 of the Gencral

20 Plan also create internal inconsistencies with Section 3.5.7 of the General

21 Plan, which calls for the creation of a system of park, recreational, and

22 open space lands to serve the needs of Antioch residents of all ages, by
23 preventing the City from extending open space resources to residents

24 beyond the Urban Limit Line.

25 d. The Richland Ranch Initiative amends Section 4.1 of the General Plan to

26 provide directive that the most suitable locations for development within

27 the City of Antioch are within the Sand Creck Focus Area; yet, the

28 Richland Ranch Initiative simultaneously revises Section 4.4.6.7 to reduce

0xJaUAUn the development capacity of the Sand Creek Focus Area. The revisions to
Section 4.1 also conflict with statements in the Land Use Element and

Housing Element of the General Plan that seek to encourage infill housing
development throughout the City.

e, The Richland Ranch Initiative creates two overlay districts within the
western portion of the Sand Creek Focus Area: Limited Development Area,
and Restricted Development Area. While General Plan Section 4.3.2,
Community Structure Policies, requires the maintenance of rural land uses

10 (one dwelling unit per five acres) and compatible open space/recreational

11 uses in areas outside the Urban Limit Line, the Richland Ranch Initiative

12 instead extends rural uses at a density of one dwelling unit per eighty acres

13 within the Urban Limit Line through the Restricted Development Area

14 overlay zone applies to portions of the Sand Creck Focus Area.

f.

15 In creating the two overlay districts within the western portion of the San

16 Creek Focus Area, the Richland Ranch Initiative eliminates the previous

17 applicable base land use designations of Open Space, Hillside and Estate

18| Residential, Golf Course/Senior Housing/Open Space, and Estate and

19 Exccutive Residential/Open Space. However, the amended Figures 4.1 and

20 4.8 no longer indicate where new base land use designations exist within

21 the Limited Development Area overlay zone. Thus, the amendments in the

22 Richland Ranch Initiative create a gap in land use designations within the

Sand Creek Focus Area.

23 g.

24 The Richland Ranch Initiative amends Section 4.4.6.7, Sand Creek Focus

25 Area, of the General Plan such that residential devclopment within the

26 Limited Development Area will consist of only single-family housing

27 types and residential development within the Restricted Development Arca,

28 if any, will be consistent with the low-density rural single-family detached

BUCHALTER housing land use designation. These restrictions on any multi-family

3 4.B and Table 4.D, both of which provide for 433 multi-family dwelling

un total of 25 to 35 acres within the Sand Creek Focus Area to be reserved for

6 h. multi-family housing at a maximum density of 20 dwelling units per acre.

7 The Richland Ranch Initiative's creation of a Restricted Devclopment Area

8 overlay zone conflicts with the goals of Section 4.4.6.7, Sand Creck Focus
Area, to provide for range of housing choices that includes Hillside Estate

10 Housing within the hilly portions of the Focus Area at density of one

11 dwelling unit per acre and lots sizes of 20,000 square fect, as opposed to 80

acres.

12 i.

13 The Richland Ranch Initiative amends Section 4.4.1.1, Residential Land

14 use Designations, and Table 4.A, Appropriate Land Use Types, of the

15 General Plan so as to create a new "Rural Residential, Agriculture, and

16 17 Open Space" land use designation. However, the uses permitted and

18 prohibited under Table 4.A conflict with the uses describes as permitted
under the text in Section 4.4.1.1.

-
19 The Richland Ranch Initiative's amendments to Section 4.4.1.1,

22 k. development of a sports complex within the Sand Creek Focus Area.

23 The Richland Ranch Initiative eliminates from the Sand Creek Focus Area,

24 Section 4.4.6.7, the requirement that a specific plan or alternative planning

25 process be prepared and approved for the Sand Creek Focus Area to ensure

26 that financing of required public services and facilities are adequately

2 166. The amendments to the General Plan affected by the Richland Ranch Initiative
3 have resulted in a Gencral Plan that is no longer an integrated, internally consistent, and

4 compatiblc statement of goals and policies.

5 167. Petitioner has a clear, present beneficial interest in the issuancc of writ of mandate
6 because it is the owner of property directly affected by the Richland Ranch Initiative's improper

7 amendment of the General Plan. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the
8 ordinary course of law, other than the relief sought in this Petition, in that the City has adopted

9 the Richland Ranch Initiative in violation of Petitioner's property rights. Absent intervention by
10 this Court, the City will continue to violate those rights. No additional administrative appeal or
11 other form of relicf is available to prevent this continuing harm.

20 169. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference into its Seventeenth Cause of Action
21 paragraphs 1 through 168 of this Petition as if set forth herein in full.
22 170. Under California law, a local government may not adopt ordinances that conflict
23 with the state Planning and Zoning Law, Government Code Sections 65000 et seq. (Lesher
24| Communications, Inc. v. City of Walnut Creek (1990) 52 Cal.3d 531, 547.)

25 171. The State of California is currently facing a protracted housing crisis that has only
26 grown more severe in recent years. The State Legislature has adopted a series of laws, including
27 the Housing Element Law (Gov. Code § 65580 et seq.), that scek to ensure the availability of
28 decent housing and a suitablc living environment for every Californian. (Gov. Codc § 65580,

BUCHAITER
CexrosaNe9 34

Sax 18347* PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
BN 34134528v5

subd. (a).) The Legislature has found and declared that "designating and maintaining a supply of
2| land and adequate sites suitable, fcasible, and availablo for the development of housing sufficient
to meet [localities'] housing need[s] for all income levels is essential to achieving the state's

4 housing goals . . . ." (Gov. Code § 65580, subd. (f).)

172. The Housing Element Law requires each city to assess its housing need and create
an inventory of resources and constraints relevant to the meeting of those needs. (Gov. Code §
65583, subd. (a).) Each city must prepare an inventory of land suitable and available for
residential development, including vacant sites and sites having "realistic and demonstrated
potential for redevelopment." (Id., subd. (a)(3).) Further, housing elements must include an
10 analysis of potential and actual governmental constraints upon the development of housing,
11 including any locally adopted ordinances that directly impact the cost and supply of residential
12 development. (Id., subd. (a)(5).)
13 173. Prior to adoption of its housing element, cities must submit a draft to the
14| Department of Housing and Community Development ("HCD") to allow HCD the opportunity to
15 determine whether the draft element substantially complics with the requirements of the Housing
16 Element Law. (Gov. Codc $ 65585, subd. (b), (d).) Similarly, 60 days prior to adopting an
17 amendment to its housing element, cities must submit the draft amendment to HCD for HCD's
18| review and compliance determination. (lbid.)

19 174. Prior to adoption of the draft element or draft amendment the city's legislative
20| body must consider the findings made by HCD. (Gov. Code § 65585, subd. (e).) If HCD finds

21 that the proposed element or amendment does not comply with the requirements of state housing
22 laws, the city must either (1) change the draft element or amendment to substantially comply with
23| those laws, or (2) adopt the element or amendment without modification, and adopt written
24 findings explaining the reasons why the legislativc body believes the amendment complies with
25 state housing laws notwithstanding the findings of HCD. (Id., subd. (f).)

26 175. In 2017, the California Legislature granted HCD additional authority to review any
27| action by a city that HICD determines is inconsistent with an adopted housing element. IfHCD
28 finds that the action docs not substantially comply with the Housing Element, HCD may revoke

BUCHALTER
A ITONSSIUZAL COOAE0S 35
a svcasco) PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
BN 34134528v5

1 its prior compliance findings and must notify the city of its violation, and may additionally notify

2 Office of the Attorney General that the city is in violation of state law. (Gov. Code § 65585 subd.

3 (i), (i).)

176. On or about December 22, 2014, the City submitted its revised draft Housing

5 Element for review by the HCD, and on or about February 20, 2015, HCD certified the City's
6 Housing Element.

177. In April 2015, the City Council adopted its 2015-2023 Housing Element, through

8 which the City committed to mecting its fair share allocation of regional housing needs
("RHNA") and through which the City identified existing constraints on opportunities for
10 housing. The RHNA represents the number of additional housing units needed to accommodate

11 the forecasted growth in the number of households and to achieve a future vacancy rate that
12 allows for healthy functioning of the housing market.

13 178. The Richland Ranch Initiative, on its face, amended the Housing Element of the
14 City of Antioch's Gencral Plan without complying with the procedural requirements of Section
15 65585. Neither the City nor the City Council ever submitted the Housing Element amendments
16 contained in the Richland Ranch Initiative to HCD for review prior to City Council's adoption.
17 HCD was never given the opportunity to review those amendments, and never will since further
18 approvals would be ministerial, to evaluate their compliance with state housing laws, or to submit
19| a report for the City Council's consideration. On information and belief, Petitioner alleges that the
20 Housing Element has not been certified by HCD subsequent to its amendment by the Richland
21 Ranch Initiative.

22 179. Further, the City's adoption of the Richland Ranch Initiative, and the terms and
23| provisions therein, is inconsistent with the City's adopted Housing Element in that it substantially
24 reduces the amount of land in the City designated for housing. The City did not evaluate this

25 actual governmental constraint that directly impacts the cost and supply of residential
26 development in violation of Section 65583, subdivision (a)(5).

27 180. The proccss for adopting and amending the Housing Element of city or county's
28| Gencral Plan, as outlined in Government Code Section 65585, was delegated by the California

BUCHALTER
A PRIPESSIISAL COEPPNAIIOS 36
S1a IemO PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
BN 34134528v5

1 Legislature exclusively to the locally elected legislative bodies and is not subject to the initiative

2 process. The Housing Element is unique among the elements of a General Plan in multiple ways
3 that proscribe its amendment by initiative. Among other things, the availability of adequate
4| housing has been publicly declared to be a matter of statewide concern, and the procedural and

5 substantive criteria for Housing Elements are detailed and complex. (See Gov. Code §§ 65913.1,

6 65913.9.) Indeed, the requirements and prescriptions of Government Code Section 65913.1 are
explicitly exempt from the general rule in Section 65800 that local governments are entitled to

8 broad discretion over zoning matters.

181. The financial and legal consequences to a city or county of having an invalid
10 and/or uncertified Housing Element are severe. In addition to exposing the City to further review

11 by HCD and potential referral to the Attorney General's Office, the adoption of an uncertified
12| Housing Element likely disqualifies the City from receiving transportation funds from the state.
13 For example, the One Bay Area Plan is the transportation and land use plan adopted by the
14 Metropolitan Transportation Commission (the regional planning organization for roads and transit
15 in the San Francisco Bay Area, of which the City of Antioch is part). Only communities with
16 HCD-approved Housing Elements are eligible for funding from the One Bay Area Grant
17 ("OBAG") program. Because the City's Housing Element is no longer certified or approved by
18 the HCD due to its amendment by the Richland Ranch Initiative, the City is no longer eligible to

19 receive OBAG funds.

20 182. a Petitioner has a clear, present beneficial interest in the issuance of a writ of
21 mandate because it owns the property directly affected by the Initiative's improper amendment of

22 the Housing Element. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary
23 course of law, other than the relief sought in this Petition, in that the City has adopted the
24 Richland Ranch Initiative in violation of Petitioner's property rights. Absent intervention by this
25 Court, the City will continue to violate those rights. No additional administrative appeal or other
26 form of relief is available to prevent this continuing harm.

27 183. On the basis of this violation of state law, Petitioner seeks the issuance of a writ of
28 mandate commanding the City to set aside and void its adoption of the Richland Ranch Initiative,

184. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference into its Eighteenth Cause of Action
paragraphs 1 through 183 of this Petition as if set forth in full.

8 185. As alleged above, Section 5 of the Richland 5 Ranch Initiative amends the City's

9 Gencral Plan in a manner that affects the permitted uses and intensity of uses of the Oak Hill
10 Property. As a result of the Richland Ranch Initiative, the development potential of the Oak Hill
11 Property has been reduced to, at the very maximum, 5 dwelling units, 0.0125 dwelling units per
12 acre, or 0.3% of the prior development potential.
13 186. Because the amendments affect the permitted uses and intensity of uses of real
14 property, pursuant to Government Code Sections 65091(a) and 65353(b), the City was required to
15| provide notice of the proposed amendment at least 10 days prior to the City Council meeting on
16 July 24, 2018. It did not do that.

17 187. The City's amendment of the General Plan without providing Oak Hill the

3 that treat similarly situated individuals differently, it must provide a reason for that disparate
is treatment that is rationally related to the protection of the public, and consistent with the general

191. In adopting the Richland Ranch Initiative, the City has provided favored treatment
to Richland Communities to the detriment of Petitioner, volunteering land owned by Petitioner to

act as open space and mitigation for the Richland Ranch Projcct, without any rational basis in the

9 public benefit and in a wholly arbitrary manner in violation of equal protection under the law.

6 DECLARATORY RELIEF

7 Facial Taking
(Against all Respondents and Does 1-40, Inclusive)

9 199. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference into its Twenty-First Cause of Action
10 paragraphs 1 through 198 of this Petition as if set forth in full.

11 200. An ordinance regulating the use of property effects an unlawful taking if it does
12 not substantially advance legitimate state interests, or it denies the owner of any economically

13 viable use of its land.

14 201. As alleged above, prior to adoption of the Richland Ranch Initiative, the Oak Hill
15| Property was designated for Golf Course Community, Senior Housing, and Open Space in the
16 City of Antioch General Plan, and was part of the Sand Creek Focus Arca, which allowed for a
17 maximum of 4,000 dwelling units across the focus area and encouraged single-family detached

18 and small lot single family units fronting a golf course at a density of four dwelling units per acre
19| in addition to age-restricted senior housing. Before the Richland Ranch Initiative, the General
20 Plan would have allowed up to a maximum of approximately 1,000 dwelling units on the portion

21 of the Oak Hill Property designated Golf Course/Senior Housing/Open Space.

22 202. As a result of the Richland Ranch Initiative, the development potential of the Oak
23 Hill Property has been reduced to, at the very maximum, 5 dwelling units, 0.0125 dwelling units
24. per acre, or 0.3% of the prior devclopment potential.

25 203. The Richland Ranch Initiative also declares the Oak Hill Property as open space to
26 prevent any further development in the western part of the Sand Creek Focus Area all so that
27 Richland Ranch could be developed, and Petitioner was never compensated by Richland
28 Communities, or the City of Antioch for the use of Petitioner's property as mitigation for

1 Richland Ranch.

2 204. An actual and judiciable controversy now exists between Oak Hill, on the one

3 hand, and Defendants, on the other. It is Plaintiff's position that the enactment of the Richland

4 Ranch Initiative by the City constitutes an illegal taking in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth

5 Amendments of the United States Constitution, as it denies Petitioner of any economically viable
6 use of their land. All of the uses permitted by the Richland Ranch Initiative are either illusory, or
are not economically or operationally viable in light of the location and physical characteristics of

8 the affected land. As consequence, the Richland Ranch Initiative requires Oak Hill to sacrifice
all economically beneficial or productive uses of their lands, and to leave its property
10 economically idle as open space only for the benefit of Richland Communities' project.
11 205. On information and belief, Defendants dispute that the enactment of the Richland
12 Ranch Initiative constituted or effectuated an unconstitutional taking with respect to Oak Hill.
13 206. A declaratory judgment in this case is necessary and proper, as it would clarify the
14 parties' respective rights and obligations under the Initiative.

A. AMENDMENTS TO INTRODUCTION.

1. Chapter 1.0 of tho General Plan, entitled "Introduclion," contains a section 1.0, ontilled *Introduction." That section is amended as follows:

1.0 introduction

Antioch ls a communily preparing for change. Currently known as a bedroom community connected to distant employmant centers in the Bay Area, Antioch is in the process of:

expanding its employment base to provide a balance between local jobs and housing;

managing rosidential growth 1o provide an appropriate range of housing opportunities within the voter-approved Urban Limit Line (ULL), including execulive housing, traditional single family neighbornoods, middie lo upper end altached housing products, and atfordable housing, and age-restricted houaing for senjors, and to.preserve and protect aqricultural, natyral resource, and open space 1505 on lands outside the ULL by estabilshing a line beyond which no urban land uses may be designated;
resolving ongoing traffic congestion and safety problems; and

re-eslablishing the Rivertown area and walerfront as a distinclive part of the
City's idenilty.

The Antioch General Plan represonis : comprehensive effort to achieve these and other community goals, and to enhance the quality of life of existing and future residents, in part by ensuring that future yrowth and development will occur only y in the ULL. The General Plan defines what makes
Antioch special place, 8 for ils future, and sels forth action-oriented programs to achleve thet future. in accomplishing these tasks, the Goneral Plan defines *quality of Iife* issues, including:

enhancing family-oriented activities by reducing commute limes to work and providing a broad range of recreational lands and activities within the community:

faciklating mobility via public transil, automobilo, bicycle, and pedestrian modes of
transportalion: and

working with local school districts to provde high quality educational facilities and
services.

The Gieneral Plan serves as the City's lead policy document as to how Antioch will manage its future, and is the City's official pollcy statement identifying the manner in which Antioch expects to coordinate i activities with those of other agencies, as they will affect the communily in the future.

Antioch's.growth pattern over the pasi 20 years nas been the resull of planning efforts derived from previously adopted policy documents (including the preceding 1988 General Plan), specific plons, past development approvals, and infrastructure financing mechanisms. Since 1988, considerable changes have occurred in Bay Area housing and employment patterns, : ell as transportation systems.

Furthermore, the passage of two three voter-approved growth initiatives, Antioch's Measure Kand !! advisory Moacura U, and the County'e Moaeure C, has Increased the need for careful manogemeni ‹ growth.! 1addition, the West Sand Creck Open Space Protestion, Puhlia Safety Enhancement, and Dovelopment Restriction fnitiative reaffirms and strengthens the City's ULL by ensu ing that (1) the ULL, can only be changed by Antioch voters, (2) future growth and deveiopment will occur only within the U astablished by the voters, (3) development will not occur in areas outsido the ULL that are not appropriate for urban growth because of physical unsuitability evelopment unstable geological conditions, inadeguate water availability. the lack of appropriate infrastructure, distance from existing development, likellhood of substantial environmental damase or substantial iniury to fish or wildilfe or their habitet, and other similar factors, and (4) development_within the ULL in West Sand Greok will only occur.on flatter and environmentally-sensitive lands.
Over the past 30 yoars, sustained employment growth without corresponging housing davelopment in certain portions of the Bay Area has forced workers in those localions - traditionally in San Francisco, San Matoo, and Santa Clara Counties, but more recenily, Walnut Creek, Concord, Livermore, and Pleasanton - to seek housing in eastern Contra Costa County. This combination of conditions produceci rapid residential growth in Antloch. Belweon 1990 and 1999, the City added over 6.300 housing unils and the population grew by neorly 20,000. an increose of more than 30 percent. The existing disparity in the location of employment growih and population growth in the Bay Area has led to the traffic congestion Antioch residants experience along State Route 4. To create a more oquitable jobs/housing balance (and reduco commule limes). Anfioch has sought to expand and diversify its employment base and provide a greater variety of housing types within tho ULL, than are currenily offered.

A discussion of these 1o voter-approved measures is contained in Section 5.1 of the General Plan.

2. Chopter 1.0 of the General Plan, entitled "Introduction," contalns a subsection 1.1.4, entitled *The Comprehensive Nature t the 1 Pian," and a subsection ontitled, "Identification of Issues. That subsection i s amended as follows:

1.1.4 The Comprehonsive Nature of the Generai Plan
To be effective as a decision-making toot, the various elements of Ihe Antioch Genoral Plan integrate the management of the community's future physicnl, social, environmental, ic environments.

Idontification fIRSUAR. The General Plan not only addresses tho issues that the State requires ba included in a General Pian, but elso responds to the current and future issues that Antioch faces. Key community issues that the General Plan addresses include:

achieving and maintaining a vibrant community in which all residents enjoy a wide range of employment, shopping, and recreational opportunities;
achleving a balance between local jobs and housing by increasing Antioch's attractiveness for the establishment of office-based and clean industrial businesses;
revitatizing the community's downtown and re-establishing the Rivertown area and waterfront as a distinctive part of the City's identity;

providing regional and local mobility and reducing ongoing trattic congestion problems through a combination of regional highway, local roadway, and transit improvements (e.g., bus, rail, BART. &-BART), transit-onented development, and enhancement of bicycte and pedesirian modes of transportation;

establishing clear performance objectives for area infrastructure and servicos. thereby ensuring that the provision of public services and facilities supports the community's delermination of desirable land uses, intensily, character, and rate of growth, all within
the ULL:

improving the design quality of lands and development at key interchanges along State Route 4, and along the roadway corridors feading to the Riverlown area; and

managing the rate of residential growth and achieving an appropriale range of housing opportunities within the ULL, Including execulive and upper end housing, as well as housing workers, seniors, and young adults who starting their careers and
forming families.

3. Chapter 1.0 of the General Plan, entitled "Introduction," contains a soction 1.2, entilled "Existing and Emerging Trends Affecting Antioch's Future.* That section is amended as follows:

1.2 EXISTING AND EMERGING TRENDS AFFECTING ANTIOCH'S FUTURE

The primary purposo of planning and preparing the General Plan is to provide the means for Antioch to manage future growth d chango within the ULL. However, merely projecting what exists today into the future, thereby assuming that the future will resemble the present will not provide an accurate picture of what the fature will be. An erray of existing and emerging social, technological, and economic trends will change the way residents perceive it air communities, define "quality of life," and live their lives. The following is Intended provide a descriptive evaluation of the ways which existing and emerging social, technological, environmental, and economic trends may interact with exisling and futuro conditions lo provide a contoxt for planning Antioch's fulure within a society that may be very dilferent from today. These trends include the following:

• A growing statewide and local population. Population increases will continue within California as a result of natural i creases. . Is, such s Antioch a nd castern Contra Costa County will also continue to grow and must be prepared to.provide new housing opportunities within the ULL.

5

An evolving housing markel As lower and middle income households are continued to be priced out of the market, and the senior population grows, upper end housing, condominiums. age- restricted houstng, and mulli-family development within the ULL will becomo more popular and important in Aniloch.

Technological advances I o changing economy significantly altering pattorns of employmont. Tradilional Industrial development will decrease in importance, service jobs and off-based employment grows. As a resull, there willt be need for office-based and retail service development.

A growing regional imbalance of jobs and housing. ABAG's projections ot a worsening imbalance between jobs and housing will result in an increased difficulty to attract workers to increasingly congested employment centers within the inner Bay Area, along with an increased willingness for businesses lo locale in presently outlying areas near their workers.

Increases in personal travel. Non-peak hour travel will increase in relation to peak hour Iraffic. The "peak hour" of traftic will lengthen over several hours.
increasing acceptance of- public transit and other allematives to automobile trovel. As tralfic congestion increases, public transit will gain parity in terms of commute times during peak hours, and become more popular, even il it involves changing modes of (e.g., rail ore-BART. to BART or othor rail connection). As a result, there wili be a noed for transit centers within Antioch. In addition, as higher density transit-ariented development goins popularity, pedestrian and bicydlo travel will increase bolh as a form of recreetion and as a form of transportation. The result will be an increasing need for safe pedestrian and bicycie roules between residential areas and schools, shopping, recreation, and places of employment.

• Changes in freight transportation end goods movement. Rail traffic will Increase over time, increasing congestion where artorials cross rail lines al-grade. There will be an increasing need for multi-modal facilities to transfer containers from rail to truck.
Changes in shopping and the new consumer. Existing shopping facilities will becorne obsolete, and need to be remodaled to meet changing shopping patterns in the future. Tharo will be a growing demand and support for sp-scale shopping in Antioch.

B. AMENDMENTS COMMUNIIY VISION ELEMENT.

Choptor 2.0 of the Gonoral Plan, entitled "Communily Vision," contains a section 2.3, entitled "General Plan Thomes.* That : emended lollows:

GENERAL PLAN THEMES
The General Pion represents a detailed statement for achleving community vision and managing growth and change in the years ahead. This n, and the means that will bo employed to ochieve are embodied in the following themes that are reflected throughoul the General Plan.

1. Now growth and devolopment within the voter-approved Urban Limit Line (ULL) can and will be directed toward meeting community objectives and needs.

Antioch can grow and stil remain a healthy and vibrant community, If this growth is managed, and occurs in the areas that can best accommodate It particularly within the ULL, such as selected portions of tha Sand.Greek Foous Area that have lonn bean. planned to accommodate Antioch's future growlh. Targeling of the type, intensity, and location of new growth within the ULL, along with managing the rate of new residential development, will faciltate achievement c community objectives, such as:
a. Balancing the provision of diverse housing options within the ULL with local employment opportunities;

b. Creating an exciling urban core within the Rivertown area with diverse economic, housing, cultural, and entertainment opportunitles;

C. Promoling a diverse economic base lhat serves Antioch residents through an expanded local employment base and entrepreneurial opportunitios; maintaining sufficient municipai rovenues lo cover the cost of high quality municlpal services and facilities: enhancing opportunities for cuftural, scientifio, corporate, entertainment, and educational institutions; and meeling the chailenges of economic compatition;

d. Enhancing mobility for the movement of people and goods within the community and region through well-designed, balanced transportation systems thet provides feasible altematives lo personal aulomobile travel (pedestrian, bicycle, and transit), and by maintalning a pattern of land Uses supports e modes of transportation;

e. Maintaining a match beiween the oxpansion of the City and its service and intrastructure systerns within the ULL. including transportation syslems; parks, fire, sanilary sewer, water, and flood control facilities; and other essential municipal servicos;
Facilitaling the provision of high quality education within the community by providing for the construction of new school facililies:
Providing adequate support for businesses and institutions that serve the needs of the community, including hiah-quality new housing in master-planned communities within the ULk; schools; quality medical care facilities. including a ful service hospital with

acute/omorgency care and local madical clinics and services; chiki and adult day care centers; fibraries, shellers, pubtic audiloriums; social clubs and recreation centers; and ploces of worship; and

h. Protecting the character of establlshed residential neighborhoods.

2. Economic vitalily will be promoted to provide local omploymont and entrepreneurial opportunities, diverse shopping and commerci servicos, and adequate municipal revenues.
Many residents commute to distant employment desfinations because their job skills do not maich existing local employment opportunities. These long commutes have resulled in congested highweys, and are a significant constraint on residents* quality of life. To reduce congestion and enhance residents' quality of life, Antioch will expand its employment base, an work toward a balance between local jobs and housing. Although it is recognized that not all residents will choose to work within Antioch, and not ali workers will live tocally, Antioch's vision is that the majority of its working population will be employed locally. Such a choice will be made possible by providing as close a match between the range of local employment- generating uses and housing types : can be achieved within the ULL.
Antioch's quality c t lite also depends, In part, on the services provided by the Cily. Antioch's vision encompasses high qualily public safely services, along with wide orray of other community amenilies and public racroational activities. To alford the provision of such services, the City will support a vigorous business community and an economic cilmate wherein existing businesses desire to remain and expand, and new businesses want to locate. Such a business community will meet the needs of residents and other businesses by providing desired commercial and professional services and a broad array of convenience, specially, nd "big ticket." retaii goods, as well as leisure-oriented and entertainment usos. Providing such an arrey of retail and commercial service uses roprosonts much more than just municipal income for the City: providing the fult range of relail and commercial services desired by Antioch residonts will also be an important factor in enhancing comnmunity idontity and pride.
Anlioch will be a healthy, family-oriented communily.
The well-being of Antioch's children, familles, and seniors is critical to the community's own well-being. Antioch is, and will continue to be largely comprised of eingle-family dwelling and ls designed for fomilios • Although not direcily provided by the Cily, high quality educational servicos are critical to community success. Thus, Antloch wilt maintain a closa partnership with the Antioch Unified School District ta facilitate the provision of superior schoot facilities, including shared achool/park facilities, and to meintain a focus on what is bast for the community's youth. As Antloch's poputation grows, the City will work with Los Medanos Collego to expand its programs, and will work CSU Hayward to establish a satellite campus within the City.
An array of high quality neighborhood oriented and community-wide parks and recreational facilities will l e maintained, along wilh community gathening places along the riverfront, as a means of enhancing Antioch's desirabitily illies. Antloch recognizes existing demographic trends, and tho desirability of retaining local residents in the community for their retirement yoars. Thus, new housing in areas long planned for future growth within the ULL, facililies, and services for seniors will be provided wilhin the community. Antioch will thus assist in meeting the needs of public, private, and voluntary organizations and institutions that provide important community support services by maintaining an adequato Inventory of lands within the ULL r such uses.
The City recognizes that land use patterns direcily affect the quality of lives of families. Long commules belween Antioch and distant employment centers create stress for residents, and detracts from family life. in turn, long commutes between Antioch emplovers such as Kaiser Permanenta.and distant houning opportunities in other communities creates similar stress for employses. The availabilily of servicos in nearby locations. including health care, education, recreation, day care, and shopping is not just a convenience, but is a key component of people's qualily of life.
The Cily also recognizes the changing nature of the family, including singte parent households and e growing number of singles who may band together to form households within the community. As a result, programs for children, undertaken in conjunction with tocal school districts, will become more important over time as a means of provlding a full range of services, and maintaining a high quality of life for locat residents.

4. Anlioch will
aulomobile. mobile community, providing options in addition to the single occupant

The freedom provided by the privale automobile has dominated the form of modern urban America over the past several decades. Although the automobile modern highway systems have given workers the freedom to move into distant suburban locations in search o newer and higher quality housing than they could olherwise afford cioser to their places of employment. the resulling long commutes have also been a source of growing frustration. As a result, there is an increasing demand for extending mass transit systems further into suburban localions, and for enhancing alternative modes of transportation (e.g. bicycie and pedestrian) for local travel.

Antioch and other communities are also rethinking how energy conservalion, air quality management, and transportation planning goals shoud be met, along with howfrture iand use patterns need to be modilied to suppori achievement of these goals. Thus, principles of trensil-oriented development and pedesirian-oriented development wilt be implemented provide residents and workers alternatives to travel by automobile, by facilitating (ransit, pedestrian, and bicycle travel. The General Plan seeks to maximize residents* arxi visitors" freedom of movament within Antioch, providing them with viable choices as to the mode o

7

transportation they uso (e.g. automobile, transit. pedestrian, bicycle). The design, configuration, and mix of uses in sirategic localions within the ULL, such as Rivertown, the Hillcrest interchange, Sand Creek and East Lone Tree Focused Planning Areas, and the *A" Street hange witl provide an allernative 1o traditional suburban deveiopment by emphasizing a pedestrian-oriented environment, and reinforcing residents' abitily to use bicycles and public transportation.

1 Transit-oriented" developments aro typically mixed use neighborhoods or projects, within a quarter mile of a transil stop, predominantly light rail or bus transfer stations. Pedestrian- oriented devetopments priority & and respond to the needs pedestrian as a higher priority than automobile travel. By providing a compact form of development, both transit-oriented and pedestrian-orlented development also faciitate bicycle travel.

5. The resolution of community and regional issues needs to be aquilable.

In pursuing solutions to expansion and fnancing of infrastructure, including transportation facilities, and in managing future growth yithin the ULL, the City of Antioch will emphasize the concepl of equily. It is Antioch's vision that the financing of regional transportation improvements will recognizo thi e existing regional imbalance of jobs and housing is the principal cause of the congestion faced by eastern Contra Costa County residenis in their commules, Thus, the employment growth in existing employment centers is as much the cause of regional traffic congestion probiems as il is the result of housing growth in existing suburban locations. An equitable solulion to regional traffic congestion would place equal responsibllity for financing new transportation facilities on jobs-rich communities that expand thoir employment bases and on housing-rich communities ihat expand their residentiel sectors. Equity will olso be maintained in the financing of new public services and fadlities a id their long-ierm maintenance betwean axisting and developing portions of the City within the 44.L.. Thus, the costs associated with providing expanded infrastructure to newly developing areas willi be internalized within those areas. Affordable housing will be provided within Antioch in a manner that integrates such housing into the fabric of the cammunity, and does not isolato lower-income households from community amenities and activities. Finally, the notion of eguity witl Be extended to the Cily's growth management systom, which will provide opportunittes within the Ulk, for both large scale and smaller housing developors lo build ai market their products within the community.

C. GROWTH MANAGEMENT ELEMENT AMENDMENTS.

Chapter 3.0 of the Gonerol Plan, entilled "Growth Management," containe a section 3.1, entilled "Intraduction and Purpose." That section ia amanded os follows:

3.1 INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE

The premise of growth management in the City of Antioch has long been to ensure that development paid its own way, and that sufficient public services and facilities were availoble to support new development. The City dofined the desired pattern of land uses, and proactively assisted in selling up funding mechanisms for expansion of infrastructure designed to ensure lhat the costs of capital facilities needed to support growth were paid for by now development. As Indivicuat development camo forward, the emphesis was on miligating the impacts of proposed growth. Today, one of the key themes of the Anlioch General Plan is that new growth and development be direcied within the voter-approved Urban Limit Line (ULL) and toward the achievement of the community vision set forth in the General Plan. New development within the ULL noeds to make a positive contribution to the community, and not just avold or miligate ils impacts.

Antloch will face a number of difficult growth management challenges over the next 20 years as it moves from a bedroom suburb lo a full service city. Key among these challenges is the need lo effectively address nagging traffic congestion problems in the East County region n the face of rapid residential growlh forecasts. response, Antioch has committed to expand local employment opportunities a reduce the need for Antioch residents to commule long distances to work. The desire to revilalize Antioch's Rivertown area, ils riverfront, and its older areas; to enhance municipal income streams
through expanded retail opportunities, and the need to expand both upper end and affordable housing opportunities within the Ul.L, also need to be factored into the community's growlh managemont
strategy.

New growth and development within Antioch within the ULL will increaso the demand for infrastructure and services provided by the City and olher agencies. In addition, future land use and devolopment decisions will have an effect on municipal costs and revenues. As long as Antioch continues to grow in population and expand its economic base, the City's operating and capital budgets will have lo respond to increased demands for services and facilities. Since the fiscal burdon of providing expanded infrastructure is beyond the normal capacity of municipal revenues, it is imperative that the expansion of the Cily's residential and non residential sectors occur such that a burden is not placed on the
communily's resources.

As discussed in Section 3.1.2, Antioch voters passed an advisory growth control measure. Measure U calls for the City | o not anly enforce public services and facililies performance standards during th review of individual development proposals, but also to phase the rate of new development to ensure the continuing adequacy of those services and lacifities. Managing the rate of growth adds a new challenge. To implement annual growili linite in addition to the public services and facilties performance standards that the City has been implementing, along with large-scale assessment distridls to provide up-front financing of infrastructure, requires that caro be tokon to ensure the viability of cuch infrastructure financing mechanisms.
Il is the purpose of lhis Elemont of the General Plan to bring together those portions of the General Plan that dress aspects growth managemont, and thereby set forth a comprehensive stralegy lo manage the location and rate of future growth and within the ULL. Itis also the purpose of the Growth Management Element to implement the provisions of countywide Measure J and the Cily's Measures U, K,and the Wost Sand Croek Open Space Proteciion. Public Safety Enhancement, and

8

Development Restriction Initiative (see Sections 3.1.1, and 3.1.2, and 3.1.3 befow). The Growth Management Element thus sets forth performance standards for key communily services and facilitios within the ULL, thereby establishing a clear linkage between future growh within the ULL and the adequacy of community servicos and facilities.

2. •Chapier 3.D of the General Plan, entitted "Growth Manegement,* contains a subsection 3.1.1, entitled *Contra Cosia County Measure J Requirements." Thal subsection is amended as follows:

3.1.1 Contra Costa County Measure J Requirements

One purpose the Growth Management Element is to comply with the requirements of the Moasure J Growth Management Program (GMP), adopted by the voters of Contra Costa County in November 2004. The GMP requires each locat jurisdiction lo meet the six following requirements: Adopt : development mitigation program;

Address housing oplions;

Participate in an ongoing cooperalive, multi-jurisdictional planning process;
Adopt an Urban Limit Line (ULL):

Develop a five-yoar capitai improvement program; and,

Adopt a transportation systems management (TSM) ordinance or resolution.

Measuro J (2004) is a 25-year extension of the previous Measure C Contra Costa Transportation improvement and Growth Management Program approved by the voters in. 1988.
Both programs include 1/ percent transportation and retail transactions and use tax intended to address existing regional transportétion probiems. The Growth Management component is intended lo assure thai future rosidential business and commercial growth pays for the faciities required to meet the demands resulting from that growth.
Compliance with tha GMP is linked to receipt of Local Street Maintenanco and Improvament Funds and Transportation for Livable Community funds from the Transportation Authority. The Growlh Manageine Program defined by the original Ordinance 88-01 continues in offect along with its linkage lo Locai Street maintenance and improvement funds through March 31, 2009. Beginning on April 1, 2009. the Moasure J CMP requiremonts take effect.
Measure J oliminates the previous Measure C requirements for tocal performance standards and level-of- service standards for non-regional routes. Moasure J also adds the requirement for adoption of a voter- approved UL.L, which the voters anproved via Measure Kin.2005 and reaffirmed and strengthened In 2018 to ensuce future that only the voters in Antioch may change the U/L., urban development gccurs only in appropriate areas within the ULL, and preserve and protect agrisultural,. natura! resource, and open space uses on lands outside the ULL, by establishing aline beyond which no urban land uses may be designated.

3 Chapter 3.0 of the Goneral Plan, entitled "Growth Management," contains : subsoction 3.1.2, entitled "Antioch's Advisory Measure U." That subsection is amanded as foilowa:

In Novemnber 1998, Measure U was approved by a large majority of Antioch voters (69 percent). Measure u was an advisory measure calling for the Cily to phase the rate of now development to:
"Provide edequate schools, street improvements, and Highway 4 improvements for a sustained high quality of Kle, by making new growth pay its own way through maxirnizing fees, assessment districis, matching fund programs, ond any othar means effective to expedile the construction of needed infrastructure."

A series of community workshops were conducted during early 1999, leading to an interim ordinance.
The interim ordinance was subsequently replacod by a permanent ordinanco that is consistent with the provisions of the General Plan Element, in addition. Measure K furthered the intent of Measure () by onsuring that the rate of new residential development is phased so that traffic improvemonts may be consiructed to accommodate existing and future Antioch residents within the ULL,
Chapler 3.0 of the General Plan, entilled *Growth Management," contains a secion 3.2, entilled "Goals of the Growth Management Element." That section is amended as follows:

3.2 GOALS OF THE GROWTH MANAGEMENT ELEMENT

To provide for a sustained high quality of life and ensure thai now development occurs only within the ULL i logical, orderly, and efficient manner, it is the goal of the Growth Management Element lo accomplish the following:
Maintain a clear linkage belween growth and devalopment within the City and expansion of its sarvice and infrastructure systoms, including transportation systems, paiks, fire, police, sunltary sewer, water, and flood control facilities; schools; and other essential municipel services, so as fo ensure the continuing adoquacy of these sorvice focilities.
This goal is comerstone of the Growth Management Etement. The quantifed public services and facilities performance standards delineated in this Element set a benchmark for quantifying the impacts of new developmont within the ULL. and also represent the measuring tool by which

9

mitigation of those impacts will be required by the City. Implementation 1 these standards is thus designed to mitigate the impacts of growth, and ensure that new developme within the UL.L. pays ils own way in terms of the capital costs associaled with needed expansion of public services and facilities. The provisions of the Growth Management Element are atso intended to address efficiency in the provision of public services and facilities. By moderating the rote of now residential growth within the UkL.. consistent with the ablity of the City and service agencies to keep pace, the cost e f providing public services can maintained at reasonable rates.
*Efficiency in the provision of public services and facilkies often also means constructing large-scale capitol facilities at the initial phase of new development within the ULL, to avold interim periods of inadequate service. Tha Cily of Antioch recognizos that that it is sometimes necessary to construct large-scale infrastructure ahead of development, possibly making financing difficull for individual devolopments. Whore financing required large-scalo capilal facilities is needed, but beyond the abilily of individual developments, many communities permit the construction of interim focilities. However, maintenance of such interim facillties is often costly, and in the end more expensive than constructing the ultimate facilities up front. a result. Antioch strives to avoid the use of interim facitities, and supports the establishment of land-based financing mechanisms in the for of assessment districts to facilitate the financing of large scale capital faciities. Pollcies refated | interim facilities and financing of capital facilities is contained in the Public Services and Facilities Element.

Maintain o moderale rate of residontial growth within the ULL, to ensure that the expansion of public services and l keeps paco.

Thie goal recognizas that there is a limit to the rate at which public services and facilities con reasonably oxponded within the ULL. Becauso long lead times for construction of regional highway improvaments, schools, and large-scale flood control facillties, the provision of some critical facitties e fall bohind rapid residential growth, even new development does ultimately pay its own way. By moderating residoniial growlh rates, potontial lag times between project approvais and housing occupancy can bo nimized or eliminated.

Recognize the ultimate buildout of future development within the City of Antioch and, its Planning Area, and the ULl, that is established in the General Plan Land Use Element.
The land use map and policies and the ULL, contained in the Land Use Elemoni dofino the City's future land use pattern, along wilh maximum propriate development I ntensities throughout the Antioch Planning Area and ULL. As result, the General Plan Land Use Element and ULL, oclablishes establish an ultimate buildout for the General Plan.

The policies of the Growth Management Element are intended to recognize that build out of the General Plan within the ULL Il occur asi ne result of numerous individual development decisions and numerous incremental improvements to the public services and facililies serving Antioch. In selting forth public services and facilities and defining the responsibllity of Individual developments within the ULL to mitigate impaots and pay their own way, the Growth Management Element is intended to provide system for the expansion of infrastructure that will support build out of tho General Plan as expressed by the ultimate buildout within the ULL established in the Land Use Element.

Manage the City's growth in e way that balances the provision of diverse housing options with local employment opportunitios and provides sufficient municipal revenves to covor the cost of high quality municipat services and facifities.

Achievement of a balance between local jobs and housing was 1 a key factor in the implementation of the City's advisory Moasure U, and key component of Antioch's vision as expressed in Chaptor 2 Community Vision, of the General Plan. The General Plan recognizes sustaining a high quality of life for Antioch residents necessarily involves reducing the need for long commutes to work, and thot balancing" jobs and housing means much more than just having an appropriate number of employment and housing opportunities wilhin the community. *Balancing" jobs and housing means providing a range of housing lypes within the ULL appropriate for the types of employment opportunities found ! Antioch. Conversely, *balancing" jobs and housing means providing the employment-genarating lands that wil provide the employment opportunities appropriale to Antioch residents. This Element is intended | assist in the financing of infrastructure needed to develop job producing uses. It accomplishes this purpose by establishing achievable performance standards and considering the feasibility financing
infrastructure expansion.

Improve regional cooperation in relation t mitigating the regional impacts of new development.
Some of the services and faciities (e.g., fire prolection, schools, and sowage treatment) provided to Antioch residents and businesses are provided by special districts, and not by the Cily. Effective management of growlh within the ULL, including miligation of impacts and expansion of services : facilities to support future growlh requires the cooperation of the City and outside agoncies providing local services. The provisions of the Growth Management Elsment, along with the provisions of the Public Services and Facilities Eloment, are inlended to provide for such coordination.

For many issues (o.g., transportatlon, air quality, and economic development), a cooperative regional epproach to problem sotving is the only effective means. Traffic congestion resulling from home-to-work trips is primarily a regional probiemn resulting from regional imbalances of employment and housing, and can only be solved by concerted elforts at both ends of existing problematic commutes.

The impacis of new developmant are nol always restricted to the municipal boundaries of the jurisdiction approving the development. Oiten, developments approved by one community impact other communities. in the ci of develooment projects that wil exacerbote regional jobs housing imbalances, the traffic, noise, and air quatilty impacts of such developmenls can manifest themselves al some distance uway from the development ilself. "Equitable" mitigation involves not only that projocts pay their own way within the jurisdiction where they jurisdictions. approved, but may also mean mitigaling impacts in other

10

The Growth Management Element seeks to establish a basis for communities lo jointly provide mitigalion for impacts occurring in other jurisdictions, as well as a basis for regional cooperation lo address regional Issues. Antioch recognizes that the effectiveness of its Growth Managemant Element ulimately relies on the extent to which active partnerships with other jurisdictions can be formed and maintained to address the regional aspects of mitigating development impacis.

5. Chapter 3.0 of the General Plan, entilled *Growth Management," contains a subsection 3.3.1, entitled "Growth Management Provisions in the General Plan." That subsection is amended, effective January 1, 2021, upon the expiration of Measure K, as follows:

3.3.1 Growth Managemont Provisions General Plan

Antioch's growth strategy is to undertake a comprehensive program to accommodate planned economic id population growth within the ULL in a manner consistent with community values and the ifestyles of existing and future residents. Thus, growth management is cantra o the General Plan, and "growth management" provisions appear throughout the General Plan. in effect, the various elements of the General Plan each address spocific aspeots of managing growth within Antioch, and are intended to work together lunction as comprehensive growth management program. The specific growth management roles of Individual General Plan elements are described befow.
The Growth Management Element implements the provisions of countywide Measure C, and provides supporting policies tor implementation of Antioch's advisory Measure U. This Element establishes a quanlified annual cap on residential growth, and sets forth roadway and highwaylew of service standards, as well es public services and facitities performance standards. This Element aiso implements the provisions of Measure Measurea sJ. K, and. the West Sand Creek Open Space Protection, Publle Safety Enbancement,and Dovelopment Restriction Initiative by providing general policy diroction for achieving a balance between local jobs and housing, as weil as for CRy participation in regional transportation planning etforts and enaucinn that future urban dexelonmont will ogour only within the ULL,.
The Lond Use Element delines acceptable locations and the appropriato intensity for new development within the_I/ll., and sets forth policies regarding developmant design and land use compalibility, By defining acceptable locations and appropriate intensities for nev development, the Land Use Element establishes the maximum allowable development intensity for the City et "build oul" f the Antioch Plonning Area and.ULL. Incorporated into ihe Land Use Élement are the provisions of a boundary agreement Antioch maintains with the City of Brentwood. The agreement is Intended to estabiish an ugrend upon boundary between the two cillies, and provide for compatible land uses along the cities' mutual boundary',
This clement elso eddresses the elfect of the urban limit line established by the-Voter-Approved Urban-kimil-Line Measure K.and reaffirmed and strengthened by the West Sand Greek Open Space Protection, Public Salety Enhancement, and Development Restriction Inllative (Figure 4.12) and directs new development occur only within the Voter-Approved Urban Limit Line, thoreby achleving compact form of community and proserving and protectinq,agricultural. natural cosource. and open snace uses on lands outside the ULL,
The Land Use Element specitically delineates lands set aside for the development of employment- generating uses, and defines the types of employrnent-generating uses appropriate for oach area so designated. Overall, the land use pattern defined in thas element, along with the aggressive economic development program called for in the General Plan, is designed to achieve a balance belween local housing and employment, allwithin the ULL. Overall, the Land Use Element sets for smart growth concepts, including providing for a close relationship between land use and transportation facilities (e.g., public transil, bicycle and pedestrian transportation, higher densily development nodes al transportalion canters).

The provisions of the boundary agreement permit either city to lerminate the agreement upon notice to the other city.

The Clicutation and Transportation Element directly addresses the provision of the new and expanded transportation faciiies that are needed to support development of the land uses delineated in the Land Use Element and located within the ULL, consistent with the levei ol service slandards set forth in the Growth Management Element. This Element defines the specific improvements that will be made over time to the City's roadway and highway syslems in order to maintain the level of service standards set forth in the Growth Management Element.
The Public Services and Facilitios Element directly addresses the provision of the new : expanded public services : adi faciiities that are needed to maintain the perfomance standards set forth in the Growth Management Element. This Element defines the responsibilities of new devolopment projects within the ULL for the provision of expanded services and facilties, provides pollcy direction for the manner in which expansion of public services and facifties within the ULL will be financed. This element also addresses avoidance of interim facilities and the financing of lerge-scale facilities needad to maintain the perfonmance standards set forth in the Growth Management Element.
The Resource Management Element provides policy direction for the management of open space, hillside development, biological resources, water resources and quality, culturat and historical resources, and energy resources in relation to now growth and development.
The Environmental Hazards Elomont addresses the constraints on growth presented by natural and man-made hazards.

A Developmant Review Program is included as pert of the General Plan implementalion programs. The Development Review Program is a compilation of Genaral Plan poticies affecting the review o individual velopment projects within the ULL. This portion of the General Plan presents a comprebensive definition of the General Plan performance standards that will be used to review new

11

development proposals in order lo implement the policies of the General Plan. Thus, the Development Roview Program sels for the specific criteria lhat will usod consistency of proposed now developments within the General Pian, determine the

In addition to the Oevelopment Review Program, General Plan implementation programs include Follow-up Studies, Intergoveramental Coordination, and General Plan Maintenance. These sections sei forth requirements for monitoring and coordination of the City's Growth Monagement Element, including motoring of compliance with stated performence standards and coordination with the City's Capital Improvement Program.

The Housing Elemont delineates the specific programs that the City of Antioch will implement to ensure housing opportunities within the ULL, for I economic segments of the economy. The Housing Element, unlike tho balance of the General Plan, is intended by state law to be short-term. selting forth a five r program. As a result, the Housing Element is required to be updated every five years. This Element sols forth speciflc policies and programns designed to ensure opportunilies for devetopment of upper and housing, and for housing for service workers who could not othorwise afford for-aale housing within Antloch. State law requires that the California Department of Housing and Community Devclopment review local Housing Elements to determine whether they applicable legal requirements.
The Measure J Growlh Management Program requires jurisdictions to report on their progress towards Housing Element compliance. The City must prepare biennial report of the implomentation of actions oullined in the City's Housing Element, for submittal to CCTA as part of the biennial GMP Compliance Checklist. The report will demonstrate reasonable progress using one of the following options:

Chapter 3.0 of the General Plan, entiltled "Growth Management," contains a section 3.4, onbilled "Service Standords tor Transportation tacilities." That soction is amended as follows:

3,4 SERVICE STANDARDS FOR TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES

This portion of the Growth Managemnent Element sets level of service' standards for roadways within the City Antioch Planning Area and the ULk, along with policies to ensure that these: landards are maintained. These standards form the basis for the City's circulalion policies, and for the ways in which land use and circulation will be corretated with each other. Roadways are grouped into two categories: "Routes of Regional Significance" and "Basic Routes."

Policies and programs to deline the responsibilities of new development projects within the ULL for the provision of oxpanded roadway facilties are provided In Chapter 7.0 of the General Plan (Circulation Eicment). Policy direction addressing the manner in which expansion of roadways and other public services and facilities within the ULL will be financed is provided in Section 8.13 (Public Servicos and Facilities Element).
Traffic levels of service (LOS) are expressed in terms of volume-to-capacity ratios to estimate the delay experienced by drives : t intersections. Theyi e expressed as the lellers A-F with A representing frao flow (volumes less than 60% of capacity, and F representing gridlock (volumes greater lhan 100% of capacily).

7. Chopier 3.0 of the General Plan, entilled *Growth Management," contains a subsection 3.4.1.1. entitled *Performance Standards for Routes of Regional Significance.* Thal subsection is amended as follows:

d. Consider level of service standards along basic routes to be met il 20-year projoctions besed on the City's accepted traffic model indicate that conditions at the intersections that will be impacted by the project will be equivalent to or belter than those specified in the standard, or that the proposed project has beon required to pay its fair share of the improvement costs needed to bring operations al impacted ersections into conformance with the applicable performance standard.

e. The policy set forth in Paragraph d, above, is based on projected, with project traffic conditions and is a more stringent standard than that required by Measure J, which does not require jurisdictions to adopt local LOS standerds. in cases where the standard set forth in paragraph d, above, is not met in the no project condition (.c. projected traffic will not meet the applicable standard, oven if the proposed project is not buit), General Pian traffic standards for Basic Routes will be considored to be met if (1) the proposed project has been required to pay its fair share of the improvement costs needed bring operations at impacted intersections into conformance with the applicable performance standard and actual physical improvements will be provided by the projeci so as to not result in a further dogradation of projected levol of service at affecied intersections.

For the five-year period from 200G to 2010, no more lhan 2,000 development allocations may be issued, Thereafter, limit the issuance of development aliocations to a maximum annual average 600, recognizing that the actual rate of growth will vary from year to year. Thus, unused development aliocations issued alter December 31, 2010 may be reallocated | subsequent years, and development allocations may be moved forward from future years, provided that the annual average of 60D development allocalions may not be exceeded during any given five-year period (i.e., n more than 3,000 development allocations may be issued for any given five-year period).

b. To move development allocations forward from future years, the following tinding mustt made:

The constraints posed by needed infrastructure phasing or capital facilities financing require that development allocations be moved forward from future years to avoid jeopardizing the feasibility of existing infrastructure financing mechanisms or the financing of infrastructure for the development allocations that would otherwise be granted during the calendar year

C. To facilitale the development of housing required to meet the needs of all economic segments of the community and special needs groups icentified in the Housing Element, age-restricted housing 3 multiple-family dwellings shail be counted as less than one single family dwelling unit for the purposes of residentint development allocations. The relationship between an allocalion for : single-farnily dwelling and an allocation for age restricted housing and mulliple-family dwellings shal be based on such factors as differences in traffic generation, school impacts, and demand for
new recreation facilities.

d. In order to avoid a predominance of any one housing type, limils shall be placed on the number of annual allocations that may be granted to oge-restricled senior housing, single family delached housing, and multifamily housing.

Permit residential projects thai are subject to limitations on development allocations to proceed with other necessary approvais not directly resulting in the division of land or construction of residential dwelling units (e.g., General Plan amendments, rezoning, environmental review, annexation, etc.). The processing of such applications is not, however, a commilment on the part of the City thot the proposal will ultimalely receive development entitlements or allocations.

To facilitate the development of housing required to meet the needs of afl econornic segments of the community and special needs groups identified in the Housing Elemenl: exempt the following types of developments from limitations on the ennual issuance of development allocations, whether for single-family or multi-family residential development. Dwelling units approved pursuant to the following exemptions shall not be counted against the established maximum annual development
allocation.

(1) Income-restricied housing needed to most the quantified objectives for very low and low income housing set forth in the Housing Element, along with "density bonus" dwelling units

15

approved pi ordinance. to the provisions of the Housing Element and the City's Density Bonus

(2) Owelling units designed for one or more Spocial Needs Groups, as defined in the Housing Element (I.e., handicapped, Income-restricted senior housing), pursuant to programs set forth in the Housing Element as noeded to meet the Housing Element's quantifed objectives for housing of special needs groups.

This invontory, including identification of locations far employment-generating uses within the ILL, and the types and intensity of development appropriate for ach location, is provided in the Land Use Element.

The L.and Use Element delineates tho inventory of residential lando yithin the Ul.l.. and defines appropriate housing types and development intensities. One of the primary objectives of the Land Elemont is to inoroase opportunitioa for looal omptoyment for exiating and future residents. Specifio plans and programs to accomplish this objoctive are set forth in that Elemont. The primary objective of the Housing Elemont is to provide housing opportunities at all incomo levels.

D. LAND USE ELEMENT AMENOMENTS.

1. The "General Plan Land Use Map." incuded in the Land Use Element as Figure 4.1, is hereby amended as shown on alteched Exbibil.I, in order la establish the land use overlay designations for the Initiative Area. For reference purposes, the exsting General Plan Land Use Map is altached to this Initiative as Exhibil M.

2. Chapter 4.0 of the General Plan, entilled "Land Use," contains a section 4.1, entitled "Introduction and
Purpose.' That section is amended as follows:

4.1 INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE

The Land Uso Elament is the cornerstone of the General Plan, setting forth Antioch's fundomental land use philosophy and directing development to the most suitable localions, particularly within certain areas such as the_Sand Creek Focus Area cast of Deer Valley Road, and In the Limited Development Area west of Deer Valley Road on flatter land appropriale for future development within the existing limits of the voter-approved Urben Limit Line (ULL). which has long been planned to accommodate anticipated future Cily growth, while maintaining the economic, social, physical, envirormental health and vitality of the communily. The Land Use Element, required t since 1955, has the broadest scope of the seven mandalory General Plan glements, synthesizing all General Plan land use issues.

This Element focuses on the organization of the community's physical environment into logical, functional, and visually pleasing palterns, consistent wilh local values, to achieve Antioch's vision for ils future. of primary concern are the typo, Intensity, location, and character of land uses that will be permitted in the future. It is the purpose of this General Plan Element to provde appropriate land within the ULL for each of the variety of aclivities associated with successful urban areas, and to guide the manner in which this land is developed and used. In so doing, Land Use Element intends to create and regulate compalible and functional interrelationships betwoen the various land uses in the Cily. Thus, I Use Element establishas City policy as lo the appropriate use and development intensity for each parcel of land within the Gity City's ULL, including the City's view of appropriate land uses and development intensity for lands outside of the Gily Citv's ULL, but within the General Plan study area.

A key consideration in lefining the type, intensity, location, and mix of future land uses within the ULL, is achieving a balance botween local employment and housing. The Antioch General Plan seeks to achieve such a balance as means of addressing issues of traffic congestion, air quality, and energy conservation. This balance, along with providing adequate land area within the ULL for the commercial uses needed by local residents and businesses, will help achieve sufficient municipal incorne to pay for the services and facilities discussed in the Growth Managemont and Public Sarvices and Facilitics elements. The ability (o commute only a few short miles to and from work on roadways that resemble the opon road more than they do parking lots is an important component of the quelity ol ife Anlioch seeks for ils residents. As more residents ihroughout the Bay Aroa e to live ar same or nearby communities and within the UL., congestion can be eased, travel speeds increased, substanlial amounts of fuel conserved, regional air quality improved. The Land Use Elemeni also seeks to ease congestion and improve regional air quality by providing pullerns of land use within the ULL, that support the use of transit. Such transit-onented* development consists of high density, mixed use development

17

adjacent to transil nodes. Such transit nodes are proposed wilhin Rivertown (adjacent lo the Amfrak platform). al Hilicrest Avenue (surrounding the BART station), and east of the SR-4 Bypass, south of the Laurel Avenue interchange (surrounding the BART station)'.
This transit oriented development node is one i three "test sitos" for smart growth sponsored by ABAG. It is part of the countywide "Shaping our Future" program.

3. Chapter 4.0 of the General Plan, entitled*Land Uso," containe a subsection 4.1.1, entkiod "Exicting Land Uoo." Thot subsection is amended as follows:

4.1.1 Existing Land Use

Despile substantial development in the past, Antloch hos a great deal of tand within the ULL available for future development. Much of the land within he City : the unincorporated portion of tha General Plan study area (22,391 acres) is vacant. Additional land is in agricultural use, and, may be available for future developmont, depending upon its land use designation and so long as such landis appropriate for development and it is within and not outside the ULL. Overall, open space uses, including agriculture, open water, recreational lands, and vacant lands account for approximately half of the land within the Goneral Plan Study Area. Major open space areas include Black Diamond Mines a Contra Loma regional parks, Antioch Dunes Natlonal Wildlife Refuge, and municipal parklands.
Within the developed portion of the City, single-family residential uses cover tne lorgest area (4,983 acres, 26.5%). Industrial uses account for 1,373 acres (7.3% of the land wilhin ihe study area). Currenily, industriat uges are concentrated in the northern portion of the Studty Area to the wost and east of Rivertown. Existing commercial uses are limited in extent, encompassing 456 pcres (2.7% of the land within the Study Area. Commercial use is concontrated within Riverlow, and along major roadway corridors, such as Somersville Road/Auto Center Drive, Hillcrest Avonue, and *A" Street/Lone Tree Avenue.

4. Chapter 4.0 of the General Plan, entilled "Lond Use." contains a subsection 4.1.2, entitled "Contra Costa County 65/35 Land Preservation Plan (Urban Limit Line).* That subsection is amended, offective January 1, 2021, upon the expiration of Measure K, as follows:
4.1.2 Contra Costa County 65/35 Land Preservation Plan (Urban Limit Line)
In 1990, lhe voters of Contra Costa Counly approved Measure C-1990. This Measure stales that urban clevelopment within the County is to be limited to no more than 35 percent of the land within Contra Costa County. At laast 65 percent of all land in the County is to be presorved for agriculture, open spaco, wetlands, parks and other non-urban uses. To ensure the enforcement of the "85/35" standard, the County has established an Urban L.imit Line (ULL), which is incorporated into the County's General Plan Open Space and Conservation Element and is intended to ensure that new urban development shal ocaur only on land anpronriate for devalopmsat within the ILL and may not occur oulside the ULL. Hence, there shall be a clear distinction between non-urban and urban use areas. The criteria set by the County tor determining lands that should be located oulside the ULL includas:
Prime agricultural lands (U.S. Soil Conservation Service Class I and Class #)

Open space, parks and other recreation areas

Lands with slopes in excess of 25 percent

Welland areas

Other areas not appropriate for urban growth because ol physical unsuitabiity for development
Measure C-1990 requires that there be no changes made to the ULL that would violate the 65/35 standard. The ULL can be changed by a 4/5 vote of the Board of Supervisors after holding a public hearing and making c or more of the following findings based substantial evidence in the record:
A natural or man-made disaster or public emergency has occurred that warrants the provision of housing and/or olher com-munily needs within land located oulside the ULL.

An objective study has determined that the ULL is preventing the County from providing its fair share of affordable or regional housing, as required by state law. The Board of Supervisors must find thal a change to the ULL. is necessary and the only feasible means lo enable the County to meat these
requirements.

A majority of the cities are party to a preservation agreement, and the County has approved a change to the ULL, affecting all or any portion of the land covered by the preservation agreemenl.
4 minor change lo the ULL witl 10 more accurately refiect topographical characteristics or legal boundaries.

A five-year periodic review of the ULL has detemined lhat, based on the criteria for establishing the ULL., new informatlon is available or circumstances have occurred, warranting a change to the ULL..
An objective study has determined that a change to the ULL is necessary or desirable to further the economic viability of the East Contra Costa County Airport, and eilher (i) mitigate adverse aviation related environmental o community impacts, c r (il) further the County's aviation rel Inceds.

A change is required to conform to applicable to California or Federal low.

18

Although the direct land use effects of the Urban Limit Line are limiled to unincorporaled areas of the County, the Contra Costa Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) has consented to support the County's 65/35 Preservation Slandard, Urban Limit Line, and Growth Management Standards in the review of proposed city spheres of infiuence and annexations. Thus, LAFCO has stated that It would not approve annexalion of lands outside of the ULL to a city. Measure 1990-C states that the County is to review the location of the ULl, every five years. Tho County voters approved Measure L in 2000, extending the provisions of Measure-G-4990-will-remain in-elfect the UL.L unil December 31. 2040 2026.

In 2000, the Counly moved its Urban Limit Line in the-Hiast-County orea Antioch over the objections of the City Council. Within the Antioch area, the Urban Limit Line was moved to coincide with the southern boundary of the City, placing lands in the unincorporaled area outside the ULL. This move shifted approximately 1,922 acres out of the ULL within the Antioch area.
In 2005, Antioch voters approved Mcasure K to create the.Citv's own ULL and to include Roddy Ranch and a portion of the Ginochio Property within the Cily ULL and the eity City limits. The ULL is intended to praserve and protect agriculturat, natural resource, and open space uses on lands outside the ULL by establishing a line beyond which no urban land uses may bo designated As approved by Antiocb voters, the entirety of the Sand Crock Focus Aren.is within the City ULL and the City limits and certain nortions of the Sand Creek Foous Area are thus an appiopriate location for future urban development.
In. 2017. the County conducted its 5-vear review of tbe_Vk.. According te the County's revtew, Antioch is anticipated to nood approximatoly more than 4,000 new reaidential housing units batweon the years 2015 and2040.Aptioch's abillty to meet this anticipated future residsotlal growth will depend on loug:planned Lin appropriate tocations within the exinting boundarlos of the City'a.UJ.ls.
In 2018. Antloch voters adopted tho West Sand Creek Open Spnce Profection, Publie Safety Enhaucement, and Davelonmont Resfriction Initiative to reattir andd strongthen the ULL. and to ansure thas future urban develepment in Antioch occurs only in appropriate.locations within.the ULL. The Initlativo also enaured that Gity's ULL cannot be changed, excent.by a voto of the people of Antioch.

5 Chapter 4.0 of the General Plan, entitled "Land Use," contains a section 4.2, entitled "Goals of the Land Use Elemont." That seclion is amanded as follows: 38

4.2 GOALS OF THE LAND USE ELEMENT

To provide for a sustained high quality of life and ensure that new development occurs within'the ULL, in a logical, orderly, and efticient manner, It is the goal of the Land Use Element to accomplish the following:
Maintain a pottem of land uses that minimizes conflicts between various land uses, and promotos rational utilization of presently undevolopod and underdovoloped land within the ULl., and supports the achiovement of Antioch's vision for its future.

Defining the appropriate uses of land within the Generat Plan study area in a manner supportive of achieving the vision Antioch has established for its future is at the crux of the Land Use Elemont. The Land Uso Element is responsive to the City's vision because it:
Promotes oxpansion of the local employment base and achievement of a balance between local employment and housing. The Land Use Etement provides for a wide variety of olfice- based and industrial employmont, including heavier industrial uses along the San Joaquin River, rail-served industries, light industrial uses, commercial services, and retail businesses, and mixed use busi office parks.

Opens up additional choices of living environment for familes. The Land Use Element provides for executive housing planned community settings, traditional singte-family subdivisions, amenity-rich middle lo upper end attached housing and age-restricted housing for senlors, high-donsity housing in transit-oriented, downtown, and mixed-use setlings.
Providos for the revitalization of the Downtown area and waterfront, integrating General Plan poticies with revitalization planning efforts undertaken by the Caty.
Provides opportunities for achieving quality design and avoiding the reientless sameness present in many suburban communilles.

Aids in stunulating economic revitalization in areas that are having dilficully competling with larger and more diversified development sites in Antioch and other communities.
Stimulates new options for development al key entry points into the community.
In defining appropriate uses within the ULL, the Land Use Element addresses the future uses of lands thal are currently undeveloped, and also sels forth desired changes in exsting L uses and development intensities . In most cases, the Land Use Element recognizes existing land uses and development densities, and may recommend urban design improvements. In some cases, such as along the "A" Street corridor north of the SR4 ireeway, the Land Use Element proposns changes in basic land uso types. In other cases, such as existing residential areas within Downtown, the Land Use Eloment recommends increases in the averall development intensily of existing land uses. Each of the recommendations contained| the Use Element are intended to resull in t harmonious pattern of land uses direcled toward meeting community objeclives : nd needs.

19

Establish a land use mix which serves to develop Antioch into a balanço community in which peoplo can live, work, shop, and have recreation without needing to leave the City.

The Land Use Element designates lands within the ULL, for broad range of residential, commeraial, employmeni-generating, public/institulional, and open space and recreational lands. Residontial id employment-generating use designations are intended to include lands provicting housing and employment opportunities for executives, managers, and professionals; highly skilled, semi- skilled, and unskilled workers; and retail and service workers. Residential land use designations are intended to provide housing opportunities for all economic segments of the community, Including_seniors, as well as for the special needs groups identified in the Housing Element. The Land Uge Elemont seeks an array of shopping and commercial service opportunitios to meet the needs of Antioch residents and businesses, including daily convenience shopping along with large-scale commercial centers for community and regional markets. The Land Use Element aims to provide a sufficient inventory of lands within the ULL, for public, institutional, and recreation uses, and seeks lo preeerve needed open space areas.

Establish an overall design statement for the City ‹ Antioch.
As important as is defining the pattern of fulure land uses within the ULL, is maintaining and enhancing Antioch's charactor and providing a pleasing visual experience to residents and visitors. Thus, Antioch's Land Use Element incorporates "urban design" concepts aimed at ensuring that the bullt environment is a physical expression of desired community character.

G. Chapler 4.0 of the neral Plan, entilled "Land Use," contains a section 4.3, entilled "Community Structure.* That soction is amended as follows:

4.3 COMMUNITY STRUCTURE

Throughout much of the General Plan study area, Antioch's land use pattern is well established, | not intended lo change over time. Future growh in the central and northern portions of the City wilt primarily consist of infill development, existing approved but undeveloped projects, and the expansion of exisling uses. As long:-planned developmont in appronriate lacations within the ULL, expands into tho southern portion of the City and its General Plan study area, Antioch will face significant challenges and be presented with significant opportunities.

7. Chapler 4.0 ot the General Plan, entitled "Land Use,' contains o subsaction 4.3.1, entilled "Communily Structure Objective." Thot subecction is amended as follows:

4.3.1 Community Structure Objective

Provide adequate land within the ULL for present and future urban and economic development needs, retaining a compact, rolher than a scattered, development pattern.

8 Chapter 4.0 ol the General Plen, entitied "Land Use,* contains a subsection 4.3.2, antitled 'Communily Structuro Policies.* That subsection is amended, effective January 1, 2021, upon the expiration of Measure K. as follows:

4.3.2 Community Structure Policies

a. As part of General Plan implementation - including development review, capital improvoment planning, preparation of Specific Plans - foster close land useftransportation relationships lo promote use of alternative transportation system modes and minimize travel by sangle occupant automobilos.

b. Give priority to new development within the ULL, utilizing existing and financially committed infrastructure systems over development needing financing and construction of new infrastructure systems.

c. Encourage high-densily residential development (both freeslanding and in mixed use projects) vithin one-quarter mile of existing and ptanned heavy and/or light rail transit stops as illustrated in the Circulation Element.
Concentrate large-scale industrial uses along the waterfront east of Rodgers Point and within arcas designaled for industrial use along existing reil lines. Limit employment-generating uses adjacent &i residential areas and within mixed-use planned communilies to business parks and office uses.
Concenirate future regional commercial uses along Lone Tree Way, SR4 and SR160 and along the SR-4 bypass.

1. Recognize the Voler-Approved Urban Limit Line (Flgure 4.12) that encompasses up lo 1,050 a es of land within the Roddy Ranch and Ginochio Property Focus Areas that were included in within the Urban Limit Line : it was twice adopted by the voters, first in 1990, and again in the-Veler Approved-Urbon-Limil-Line 2005_as e means of sing urban suburban development, preserving open space and maintaining a compact uiban form. The ULL, was then reafflrmed and strenothened by the voters, in 201ß, in the Wesl Sand Greek Open Space Protection, Public Safety Enhancement, and Deveiopment Restriction Initlative,

Chapter 4.0 of the General Plan, entilled "Land Uso," contains a Table 4.A, entitled "Appropriate Land Use Types." That table is amended as shown on eltached Exhibit N.

10. Chapter 4.0 of the General Plan, entitled 'Land Use," contains a Table 4.8, entitled *Anticipated Maximum General Plan Build Out in tha City of Antioch." That table is restated, reaffimed, readopled, and amended as shown on allached Exhibit Q.

11. Chapter 4.0 of the General Plan, entitled 'Lend Use," contains a Teble 4.D, entitled *Anticipated Maximum General Plan Build Out in the General Plan Study Area.* That table is restated, reaffirmed, roadopted, and amended as shown on etteched Exbibit.P.

12. Chapter 4.0 of the General Plan, entitled "Land Use," contains a subsection 4,4.1, entitled "Land Use Designations." That subsection is amended as follows:
4.4.1.1 Residentlal Land Use Designations.
Six Savgn residential land use dosignations are set forth to provide for development of a full range of housing types, in conjunction with residential development wilhin General Plan Focus Aroas within the ULL. Permilled maximum land use and anticipoted population densities are described for each designation. Dansities are stated as the maximum permissible number of dweiling units per net acre ihat exists within the projec: site prior to any new dedication requirements. Density is assumed to eccrue only tolands that aro "developablo." Developable acres are those lands within the boundaries of the ULL thot oro not encumbered b prior dedications of cosaments or rights-of-way, ond are not so steep (generally over 25%), unstable, fioodprono or subject to other hazerds as to be unable to support new development. Achievement of the maximum allowable density is neither guaranteed nor impiled by the General Plan. The final density of any particular residentiat devetopment type is dependent upon dovelopmont design; any phyeical, geologicat, or enviranmental constraints that might be present within the site; available infrastructure and services; and other factors. The devalopment standards that are established in the Antloch zoning ordinance might also limit attainment of maximum allowable densities.
Sacond units on a residential fot and homo occupations are permitted by local regutation. Provision of dlensity bonuses as allowed by State law and City ordinance may resull in devélopment densities in excess of the nominal maximum densky for any land use designation.
Estate Residential. Estate Residential land uses are planned as a transition between urban and rural areas, and for areas that are not suited for a more intensive form of development because of topography, geologic conditions, or urban service limitations. Estate Residential areas will also serve lo provide "execulive" housing arge lots, thereby expanding the community's range of housing types.
On designated lands where topography is not limiting, the represontolive form of development woutd be singla-family homes on lots that average one acre in size. For properties so designated lhal are situated in steeper hillside sellings, clustering of units and utilization of other hillside development techniques are anticipated and encouraged. The final approved and built density on lands in the Estate Residential land uso designation should reflect the location o f these lands as low-density rosidential transition areas between the urbanized Antioch and the undeveloped Mount Diablo Range of hills.
Since this designation is planned at the urban/non-urban interface, the type and level of development may require different construction standards, such as narrower street widths with parking along only one side of the street or no on-street parking, greater selbacks, limited sidewalk areas, etc. Davelopment may require different levei of services than thai required for strictly urban land uses. Projects that minimize the demand for urban services and provide major funding for construction of needed service facilties would be appropriale.
Environmental constraints such as steep slopes, riparion habitats. unstable soil conditions, sensitive flora and fauna, and visual prominence are often found on lands wilh the Eslate Residential designalion. These constraints may make development of these areas oxtremely sensitive, and could require creative and imaginative site planning in all projects. The steepness 4 ie slopes and the visual prominence ol these areas make many of these resources important public amenities to be preserved for a of the citizens of Antioch. Finally, as these areas will serve as a buffer between the urbanized City of Antioch and the undeveloped open space to the southwest, development must be at a level, which serves as an appropriate transition between urban and non-urban environments.

Devclopment in this calegory is generally limiled to a maximum of one (1) unit per gross developable acre, unless : densily of two (2) units | er developable acre is specified on the General Plan land use map or in Focus Area policies. Overall, residential developments within the Estale Residential land use catogory should provide large lots, and projeci a sami-rural character.
Neighborhood entry signage is encouraged lo create e sense of community, and define Estate Residential neighborhoods as special places. Wilhin hillside areas, dwelling units should be custerad on land that is relatively fat, no devolopment should occur on siopes exceeding 20 percent. Due to tho unique nature of these areas, a clustering of unils may be needed to accommodate the unit yield and stik maintain the topographic uniqueness of the area. Developments in Ihese areas should be oriented around a major amenity that increases public exposure to the more hilly terrain. Examples of such amenities include golf courses and equestrian centers.

Development in these areas c expected to be a of two (2) stories, and include generous amounts of public or open space for ective and passive recreational uses. Lands adjacent to parks, commercial uses, transht routes and rail stations, and arterial roadways would be appropriate for the upper end of the allowable development intensity r this category. Öther lands would serve as a buffer or transition between lower density residential areas and higher density residential and commerctal areas, as well as ereas exhibiting greater traffic and noise levels. At the higher end of the density range for this category, multi-farniy townhouse and apartment development is expected to be predominant. Where the Medium Density land u designation serves a transition or buffer, lower densily townhouse and small lot, single-family development would be the predominant uses.

13 The "Sand Creek Focus Area Map," included in the Land Use Eiement as Figure 4.8, is hereby omended as shown on atlached Exhiblt Q to establish the base land use designatlons for the Sand Creek Focus Area west of Deer Valley Road. For reference purposes, the existing Sand Creek Focus Area Map is atlached to this Initiative as ExhibitB.

14. Chapter 4.0 of the General Plon, entilled "Land Use," contains a subsoctlon 4.4.6.7, entitled "Sand Creek.* That subsection is amended as follows:
4.4.6.7 Sand Creek. The Sand Creek Focus Area encompasses approximately 2,712 acres in the soulhern portion of the City of Antioch (Figure 4.8).
Thie Focus Area is within the boundarles of the voter-anproved ULL and pounded by existing residential neighborhoods to the north, Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve to (he west, the oity limits and ULL to the south, and the City of Brentwood to the easl. Empire Mine Road and Deer Valley Road n in a general north-south direction Ihrough the Focus Area, dividing il roughly into thirds.
According to Contra Cosla County's 2017 review of the ULL, Anfloch is expected to grow within the boundaries of the ULL. by more than 4,000 housing units between 2015 and 2040. Long: planned residential develoament in the Sand Creek Focus Area, within the ULL., will be essential for the City to provide adequate now housing to satisfy anticipated future demand.
Purpose and Primary Issues. The Sand Creek Focus Area combines two existing policy and planning areas within the ULL. identified In the previous Generai Plan: the southern portion of "Focused Policy Area 18" and the entirety of Fulure Urban Area 1." Previous General Plan policy tied the liming of dovelopment within this Focus Area lo progressive build out of the land-immediotely to the north (the area goncrally known as Southeast Antioch), and to agraement alignment f SR-4 byposs.
Through the 1990s, build out of Southeast Antioch was largely completed. an alignment for the SR-4 bypass was selected, and financing for construction of the bypass was developed. As a result. the Cily stepped up ils planning efforts for tho Sand Creek Focus Area with area landowners. Because of the multiple ownerships within the Sand Creek Focus Area, delailed coordinalion of access and infrastrucluro, along with the establishment of workable financing mechanisms was necessary in addilior to land use planning.

25

Portions of Sand Crock, as-n stch natural hillsides and canyons within the Sand Creok Focus Area, contain habitats for sonsitive plant and animal specles, as well as hebitat linkages and movement coridors. Overall, the western westernmost portion of the Focus Area is more environmentally sensitive than the eastem portion in terms of steep topography, biological habilats and finkages, the existence o abandoned coal mines, and proximity to publio open space at Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve. The wost end of the Sand Creek Focus Aréa serves as a linkage between two regionally significant blocks of grassland. Decades of urban and agricuitural uso have groatly reduced the width of this linkage, substantially increasing the ecological importance of the remaining linkage within the Sand Creek Focus Area. Land has been preserved in regional parks and permanent open space, primarily in extensive grassland to the immediate wost and northwest, as well as south of the Sand Creek Focus Area. These preserves represent a significant investment of public resources, and are a valued public
assel.

Stream and riparian communitios occupy a smail portion of the Focus Area, but are widely distributed. Because of their high biotic value, stream and riparian communities within the Focus Area are considered to be a sensitive resource. The Focus Area also includes an oak woodland and savanna community, which, because of ils high wildlife value, is considered to be a sensitive resource.

b. Pollcy Diraction. The environmental sensitivity of portions of the Sand Creek Focus Area was recognized in the City's previous General Pian; howover, policy direction was very general. As an examplo, the previous General Plan did not provide any indication of. the maximum allovabio development intensity for Future Urban Area 1. The previous General Plan also stated that while the area between Contra Loma Boulevard and Empire Mine Road was designated Estate Residentlal, "the actual density should be besed on e dovelopmont plan that engures that the special characteristics of the area, including steep slopes, riporian habitat, and other environmentai constraints, are accommodated.
As deseribad in more dotail below, the West Sand Greek Open Space Protection, Public Safefy Enhancement and Davalopment Restriction Initiative provided more preeise direction regording approximatsly 1,352 agres ot land west of Decr Volley Road by prossiving .nearly.1,250.accas.of environmentally-sonsitive land., consistinn of more than 65% of West Sand Crosk, for open space. hillsido proservation Jew-dennity rural residential, and othsc.aimifar.uses.

The following pollcy ission and policies for the Sand Creek Focus Arco are intended to provide cicar
direction for the future development and environmental manogement of the area.
The Sand Crenk Focus Aren is stenerally intended to function as a large-scale planned community. providing needad housing and employmeni opportunitios. This Foous Area ie alse in particular, the land sast of Oaer Valley Road is intended to provido housing and substantiai ampioyment opportunities. Up to approximalely 280 a s ars-to may be devoted to reteil end employment-generating uses, w result in the creation of up to 6,500 jobs at build out.

n recognition of the i nortance of environmentally sensitive lands in large parts of West Sand Creek, the Initlative designated hillier and more environmantally-sensitive lends west of Deer Valloy Road ag a Restricted Develonment Area and flatter and less environmentally-sensitive lands west of Deer Valley Rad as a Limited Doyelopment Area. These areas shall constitute, and functlon as, overlay land use designations applicable to West Sand Creek,

Land in the Restricted Development Area provides onportunitiesfor low-density rural residentia! housing and preserves agriculture_grasslands, and open space. The "Rural Residential, Agricuiture. Open Space" base land use designation applies to the Restricted Development Area.

Residential development within the Sand-Greek-Foous Limited Development Area' will provide for
range of single-family housing types, including upper-income executive estate housing, gelf-course- orlented,-age-n housing for seniors, suburban single-family detached housing for families o seniors, and multifamily developmentas well as commercial usas, public and quast-public uses, and subsiantial open space. Subiect to the antioipated maximum General Plan build out in Antioch, as set forth in Table 4.B, the followinn base land use designations_shall apply to the Limited Developmant Area: "Estate Residential:" "Low Density, Residential;" "Medium Low Density Rasidential:" "Medium _Pensily.

The actual residential development yield of the Sand Creek Focus Area witt depend on the nature and severity of biological, geologic, and other environmental constraints present within the Focus Area, including, but not limited to constrainis posed by slopes and abandoned mines present within portions of the Focue Area; on approptiate design responses to such constralnts, and on Generai Plan pollcies. Such policies include, and but are nol limited to, identification of appropriale residential development types, public services and faciilies performance standards, environmental pollcies aimed at protection of natural topography, substantial open space environmentel resources, policies intended to protect public health and safety, and impiementation of the Resource Management Plan called for in Policy "u," below.
ml. As a means of expanding the range of housing choices available within Antioch, three two types of "upscale" housing are-to may be provided, including Hillside Estate Housing, gast of Deer Valley Rond anci Executive Estate Housing sast of Deer Valley Road and in.thu Limited Deveiopment Aren wesl of Dear Valley Road, and-Goll-Course-Orionfed Housing.
Hillside Estale Housing consisis of residential development within the hilly portions of the Focus Area gast of Deer Valley Road that are designated for residential development. Appropriate land use types include Large Lot Residential. Within these areas, typical flat land roadway standards may be moditied (e.g., narrower street sections, slower design speeds) to minimize required grading. Mass grading would not be permilted thin this residential type. Rough grading would be irnited to streets and building pad areas. Residontiol densities within Hillside Estate Areas are to be limited to one dwelling unit per gross developable acre (1 du/ac), with typical lot sizes ranging upward from 20,000 square foet. The anticipated population density for this land use typa is up to four persons per devaloped acre. Included in this cetegory is oustom home development, wherein semk-improved lots are sold to individuals for construction of custom homes. Approximately 20 porcent of Hllsido Estate Housing should couldt be devoted to custom home sites.

Execulive Estate l using consists of larga lot suburban subdlivisions within the flatter portions of the Focus Area. Appropriate land use types include Large Lol Residential, Densities of Executive Housing areas would typically be 2 du/ac, with lot sizes ranging upward from 12,000 square foct. The anticipated poputation density for this land use type is up to eight persons per developed acre.

15. Chopter 4.0 of the General Plan, entilled "Land Use," contains a subsection 4.4.7, entitled "Voter-Approved Urban Limit Line." That subsection is amended, effective January 1, 2021. upon the expiration of Measure K, as follows:
Pursuant to the Cily of Antioch Growih Control, Traffic Relief, Voter-Approved Urban Limit Line, and Roddy Ranch Development Reduction Initiative (Measure KS). the voters amended the Goneral Plan to establish the urban limit line as shown on Figure 4.12. This Voter-Approved Urban Limil Line esteblishes a line through the Roddy Ranch and Ginochiu Property Focus Areas beyond which the General Plan k use designations cannol be amended to allow uses other than open space uses. The ULL thus preserves and protects agricultural, natural resource,.and .opsn spaca uses on lands outside the UL4, by estabilshinsa line bevond which no urban land uses may be designated. Unll-Decomber 34,2020, Pursuant to the West Sand Creek Onen Space Protection.

The City shall oppose any annexation to the Cily of any land outside of the Voter-Approved Urban Limit Line.

E. COMMUNITY IMAGE AND DESIGN ELEMENT AMENOMENTS.

1. Chapter 5.0 of the General Plan, entilled "Community Imaga end Design," conteins a section 5.1, entilled "Function and Purpose." Thai section is amanded as follows:

5.1 FUNCTION AND PURPOSE

Underiying the livability and economic vitality of a community is Its perceived image. Community design quality is not just an aesthelic matter, but has distinct functional dimensions. Persistent altention to the details in the design of the built environment is an invesiment in the quality of the community. it pays dividends in residents* perception of their quality of life and the porceptions that prospoctive employers and retailers will have regarding the desirability of Antioch as a locotion for thoir businesses.
With rapid growth, rosidents. The City's appearanco has become an increasingly important issue for Antloch's Image and Design Element addrosses the visual quality and character of Antioch's built anvironment, and a continuing process to shape the community's physical form and create a more elficient, attractive, and, at timos, dremottc urban environment. As Antioch continues to grow within the existing bounsarina af the voter-anprovad Urban.L.imit kins.(ULL.), this Element, along with the Land Use Element, will provide guidance for more detailed design guidelines and standards contained in spectfic plans and planned community documents, design guideline handouts provided by the City, provisions of the sign ordinance, and other provisions of the zoning ordinance.

2. Chapter 5.0 of the General Plan, entitled *Community image and Design," contains a section 5.2, entitted "Existing Community Design." That section is amended as follows:

5.2 EXISTING COMMUNITY DESIGN
Anlioch extends in a roughly square pattern from Pittsburg on the west to the Antioch Bridge on the east, I from the foothilts of Mt. Diablo south to the San Joaquin River on the north. The City is bisected by Stale Route 4 (SR 4), an east-west-oriented four-lane freoway. The Southern Pacific Roilroad line runs east-west just north of SR 4; lhe Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad line runs east- west along the San Joaquin Rivar waterfront. The Contra Costa Canal is located south of SR 4, and traverses the Planning Areai an east-west direction.

+.-

On the north side of SR 4, older residential areas and the historic Downlown area are organized in a traditional grid street pattern. Small lots of vacant, undeveloped land are siluated betwe en homnes. such as the lots at the intersection of J and Third Streets. Thero are few large undeveloped parcels, such as the Hickmott site and the land adjacent to Beede Lumber on 2nd Street. Many of these vacant parcels are small or irregular in shape.
South of SR 4, the suburban street patterns of newer residential areas reflect their devolopment as a serics of separate subdivisions. Some vacant or underutilized parcels exist within the subdivisions. The hill and valley areas soulh of the Contra Costa Canal have grown most recently. In general, growth ov Ihe past 30 years has solidified the Cily's current role as a bedroom community for the San Francisco Bay Area,

31

/

South of SR 4, minor ridgelines occur northeast of the Contra Loma Boulevard/James Donion Boulovard intersection, east and west of Hillcrest Avenue, and in the area separating Lone Tree Way from Lone Tree Valley. Major ridgelines associated with tt foothills of Mt. Diablo occur along the entire southwest boundary of the Planning Area within the ULL, from Somersville Road to tho Cily's southeastern boundary adjacent to the City of Brentwood. Most of the open tands in the soulhwest Antioch are located within the Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve, Contra Loma Regional Park, or the Sand Creek Focus Aroa, an orea ol mosily privately owned ranch land that is planned f r development within the ULL.

North of SR tne majority of tho San Joaquin River shoreline is in park or open space uses. North of Downtown, the Antioch Riverfront Promenade, a 1/3-mile urban walkway and linear park, runs odjacent to the River, connecling the Marina and the Barbara Price Marina Park to G Street. To the west of Downtown and bordering Pillsburg, the Dow Welland Preserve forms part of the City's shoreline. To the east of Downtown, tha Antioch Dunes National Wildlife Refuge and othar open areas occupy the City's shoreline. The Contra Costo County Fairgrounds and Lake Alhambra are upland open areas among higher-density residential uses of SR 4.

The City also maintains 31 parks, varying in size and amenities from the 2-acre Deerflold Park to the 99. acro Proweit Family Water Park. The Delta De Anza Regional Trail, operated by the EBRPD, is a lincar open space clemant that begins at the City of Anlioch Community Park, and travels east along the Contra Costa Canal.

3. Chapter 5.0 of tha Goneral Plan, entitled "Community Image and Design," contains a subsection 5.2.1.2, entilled "Residential Districis South of the Routo 4 Freeway." That subsection is amended as follows:
5.2.1.2 Residential Districts South of the Route Freeway

Residential Existing residentlal districts south of SR 4 were built mainly from the 1950s to the present. These newer residentlal areas tend to be defined by subdivision, each with common archileclure and landscaping themes. Single-family housing is the most common type, witlh a density of approximatcly f housing units per net acre, which is p typical suburban housing donsily. Some condominium developments i 1 apariments (such as Flores Apartments, Hudson Townhouse Manor, and Delta View) are located soulh of SR 4.

Chapter 5.0 of the General Plan, entitled *Community Image and Design,* contains a section 5.3, entilled "Existing Communily Design." That section is amended as follows:

5.3 GOALS OF THE COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT

To providel sustalned high quality c fNfe and ensure that new development occurs in a logical and orderly manner, ilt is the goal of the Community Image and Design Eternent to accomplish the following.

32

Create communily design theme and a visual idonlity for Antioch, recognizing ils local as "Gatoway Dolta.

The design quality of a community and ils design oxpectations rofleot a critical philosophy regarcing communily development, whether the community is committed not only to defining the right mix and location of tand uses, but to their exceplional quality as well. Community design must reffect Anlioch's commitment to the concept that new d evelopment within the ULL needs to make a positive contribution to the community. Thus, the Communily Image and Design Element aims to:
Sustain Antloch's Idontity as "Gateway to the Delta" and provide the visual character of. unique, desirable living environment;
Contribute to the City's economic development objectives and assist in achieving local balance between jobs d housing by appealing to investors who value municlpal commitments to quality development that will protect privale sector investments| thoir projects:

Offer incenlives for new residential, commercial, office, business park, and industrial developmants wilhin the ULL to achieve excellence and mako a positive contribution to the community because the quallty be maiched or exceeded by subsequent projects within tho ULL; the project

Stimulate development of pedestrian friendly, appealing anclaves, and provide accessibaity for bicyclists;

Provide vehicle for reinforcing Antioch's heritage through compatible design and preservation/reuse of historic resaurces;

Enhance the quality of oxisting developed areas as they mature over lime, eliminating percoived differences in the quallty of newar and older portions of the community,
Stimulate ongoing pride in Antioch by its citizens and those who work in the community; and
communic to others kind of community Antioch belleves itself to be.

5. Chapter 5.0 of the General Plan, entitled "Community Image and Design." contains a subsection 5.4.2, entitled *General Design Policies." That subsaction is amonded as follows:

5.4.2 General Design Policies
a. Base the City's review of public and privale projects within the ULI, on the following general design principles.

Innovative design, regardless of its style, is more importent to the achievement of "quality" than the predetermined themes.

"High quatity" comes from the expllcit consideration of all aspects of devetopmant design. Ilis in design delails that "quality" is ultimately manifested,
Designers need to respect communily goals and needs, as as well as address their client's economic objectives.

Individual buildings and developments within the ULL, are not isotated entities, but are part of larger district and community into which they must fit. While innovation and individual expression are sought, compatiblity of design elements is also important.
Standardized design solutions, "corporale architecture," and "off the shelf models" cannot always be depended upon. What worked before or was accepled elsewhere may not work or be acceptable in the proposed application in Anlioch.
Architectural styles, landscaping, and project amenities should complement surrounding development, and convey a sense of purpose, nol expediency.
All building elevations visible to the public should be given equal attention and detail.
The same design solution, no matler tow well done, when repeated too often or over too large an area, can become boring, lose its effectiveness, and no longer communicate *quality.*
b. Incorporate Antioch's "Gateway to the Delta* theme and reminders of its community heritage into the design of new residential, commercial, employment generating, and recreational development within the ULL, as as into public facilities.

incorporaie nautical/waterway, gatewayfentry, industrial or ranching themes into the design detalls of new developments and community fackities, such as building architecture, signage, lighting standards, site paving and landscaping, street furniture (e.g.. henchos, trash enciosures and receptacles), fencing, and placement of murals and sculplure in public locations.

Maintain a consistent design theme throughout each development project. Each individual development project: area wilhin the projoct should portray an idenliliable design theme.

33

Select tree species that are appropriale to lheir specific applications (e.g.. providing shade. framing long-distance views of the San Joaquin River or Mt. Diablo, or framing short-distance new development.

C. Maintain view corridors from public spaces to natural ridgelines and tandmarks, such as Mounl Diablo and distant hills, locol ridgelines, the San Joaquin River, and other water bodies.
Recognizing that nev development within the ULL will inevilably result in soie lusy exisling views, as part of the City's review of development and commercial and industrial landscape plans, minimize the loss of views from public spaces.
Important view corridors to be protected include Somersville Road, Lone Tree Way, Hiälcrest Avenue, SR 4, SR 160, James Donion Boulevard, Deor Valley Road, and Empire Mine Road.

d. Strengthen and emphasize community focal pointe, visual landmarks, and features contributing to Antioch's identity using design concepts and standards implemented through the zoning ordinance, design guidelines and design review process, and specific pian and planned community documents.
o. Create framework of public spaces at the neighborhood, community, and regional scale.
Provide for new open space opportunities throughout the City, especialtly in neighborhoods having minimal access to opan space. This includes exploring the potential for creek corridors, bicycle and podestrian paths, and now small open space and conservation areas.
Provide an open space notwork within the ULl, linked by pedestrian and bicycle paths, which preserves and enhances Antioch's significant visual and natural resources.
Provide sitting areas within parks and along pedestrian and bicycle paths within tho ULL,.
Resiore the San Joaquin Riverfront as a linear park and multi-use rall from the westeny Cky limite to Rodger's Poinu/Fulton Shipyard.
Utilize exisling creeks, such as Sand Creek, as linear parks, providing pedestrian I bicycle palhs.

Views along utility corridore should be retained and enhanced through the use of planting materials to frame and focus views and to provide a sense af orientalinn.

f. Provide for consistent use of street trees to identify City streets, residential neighborhoods, commercial employment districts, and eniry points to the Cily.
Select species thot enhance the pedestrian characler of, and convey : distinctive and high qualily visual image for the City's streets; are drought-tolerant, fire-and pest resistant; and complement existing street trees.
Use changes in tree specica, scale, color and spacing to differentiate the roadway types identified in the Circulalion Element.

Use a consistent palette of street trees to distinguish Antioch from other communities, and to distinguish individuol ureas within the community (e.g., Rivertown, East Lone Tree, *A" Sireet Corridor) from each other.
Sireet trees should relate to the scale, function, and visual importance of the area in which they are located, stablishing a hierarchy of street trees for entry locations. intersections, and activity centers.

Mojor accent trees are to be localed at Cily and community entry locations, key intersections, and major activity centers (e.g., County East Mal, Prewei Family Park).
Street Trees should be selected as a common tree for street frontages. A single species may be selected for all residential neighborhoods different species (o distinguish different neighbornoods from each other. Within residential neighborhoods, street trees shoutd be fuk, providing shade and color. In commercial districts, the trees should provide shade but be more transparent at the motorisi and pedestrian levels lo promote views c stores fronts and visual interaction of pedestrians. Wilhin employment districts street trees should provide shade and screening, and be used to frame views of buildings and bullding entries.

9. Maintain common community design elemenis throughout the City.
Provide : systern of well-designed directional signege, fecilitating way finding to community feotures such as shopping areas, marinas, parks, and civic buildings.
incorporate common design elements in community features such as roadway landscaping, sireetlights, street signs, Iraffic lights, and community directional signage.
Use desion variations in landscaping, street light standards, and street signs as a means of defining special design districts (c.g., Riverlown, Somersville Road and "A" Street corridors).
h. Wherever feasible, existing above-ground utility Itnes should be placed underground.
i. Preserve and strengthen Riverlown vilal and attractive place.

34

Promote activity along Rivertown streets through attractive building designs wilh street level aclivity and fecade windows, public art, and other londscaping elements that are pedestrian- friendly.

Maintain views of the San Joaquin River from buildings within Rivertown, where they available, by placing windows rather than solid walls along the river side of buildings. afe

Avold blank parking garage building frontages.
Orient buildings along the first street inland from the San Joaquin River loward the river to enhance pedestrian and bicycle activity.
Ulilizo murats to enhance the dosign quality of existing targe blank walls (e.g. Campanile Theater).

Seek opportunities for small public spaces lhroughout Rivertown to provide for tho comfort of pedestrians and bicyclists, onhance street levol activity, and provide sitting areas and protection from the sun and rain. Small left over spaces between buikdings, al street corners, at the edges of parking lots, along 1 lively additions to the street scene. edges of sidewalke can thus become altractive and

Within multi-family, commordal, office and business parks, and incustrial yithin the ULL, screen enciosures, loading areas, mechanical equipment, and ouldoor storage areas fromv v from public streets, and, as appropriate, from other public views.

Ground mounted equipment incidental to mutti-family, commercial, offico, and business park development within.the 124.k, shell be eppropriately screened with solid walls, trelfises, andior landscaping. Equipment location should be away from the front of the building, and screening must be similar to adjacent archilecture and matorials.

Refuse collection areas are to be large enough 1 accommodute storage of recyctable materials, and be screenod with a solid perimeter wall using materials and colors compalible with those of the adjacent structures. Refuse collection areas should be located on an interior builcting side yord, and are to be roofed if the contents of the area are visible from a freeway.
Loading docks and areas, as well as trash enciosure areas shall be screened from public view areas. When therei s adjacent residential development, loading and trash enclosure areas sholl be physically separated and screened from adjacent residentiol structures.
Service arens, including storege, special equipment, outdoor work areas, and loading areas, should be screened from public view with londacaping and architectural elements.
Screen utility equipment and communication devices so that the project will appear free ol such devices.

k. Prohibit roof-mounted equipment (with the exception of small satellile dishes and solar panels) for single-farnily residential development consistent with FCC regulations.
New residential uses should be pre wired so as to allow for the placement of satelite dishes in a manner that is integrated with the building design, and avoids placement of dishes on chimneys or above the roof line.

Where required for commercial, office, and industrial development, screen roof mounted equipment and cellular antennas completely from public Il sides. Particular altention shall be given to the sides visible from freeways, with the intent of minimizing the need for screening devices to the greatest extent possible.

I. Screening of roof-mounted equipment and cellular antennas, where provided, should be an integral part of the building design and not appear as tacked-on afterthought. Ground-mounted mechanical equipment (vith appropriate wall or landscape screening) is encouraged as an allernalive to roof mounting.

m. All roof screens must be solld and continuous. Continuous grills or louvers must cover equipment. Roof screens will be sheathed in a matching or complementary material to the exterior building material,

n. Ublize street lights in commercial, olfice, and business park areas thal are pedestrian-orlented, attractively designed, compatible in design with olher street furniture, and provide adequate visibifly nd security.

0. Design onsite lighling to improve the visual identifcation of adjacent structures.
Within commercial areas, lighting should also help creale a festive atmosphere by encouraging evening use of areas by pedestrians.

Within commercial and industrial development within the ULL, provide design features such as screened wells, landscaping, setbacks, and lighting restrictions between the boundaries of adjacent rosidentlal land use designations the impacis of light and glaro.

projecta, lghting fixtures should be attractively designed and of a low profile to complemnent the overall design theme of the project within which they are located.

35

On-sito lighting sholl creatc a safe onvironment adhering to established crime prevention standards, but shall not result in nuisance leveis of light or glare on adjacent properties. Limit sources of tighting to the minimum required to ensure safe circulation and visibility.

p. Lighting should ccommodate night use of streets and promote security while complying with the provision of a dark night sky. Strootscape areas that are used by pedestrians al night should be w Within rural and open space areas, limit street lighling to intersections and other locations thot are needed to maintain safe access (e.g., sharp curves).
q. The design of new developments within the ULL shall protect residents* privacy by avoiding placement of windows direcily opposite each other and avoiding windows overlooking the yard oreas of adjacent residences to the maximurn feasible extent.
New mulli-family, commercial, office, and business park developments within the ULL shall emphasize pedestrian level activities by utillzing the following techniques.

design projects 50 to have centrai plaza focus which is orionted toward pedesirians;

incorporate plaza areas which con be used as informal gathering places;
Install "street furniture" (benches, bus shelters, planters, bike racks, trash receptacies, newspaper rocks, water fountains, and bollards) to create and enhanco smali plazas a similar open spaces within urban preas; and

within commercial, office, business park, and industrial developments within the ULL, ancouraga architectural slylos that provide covered verandas and other similar an-oriented shade features.

S. Where needed, undertake active programs to minimize or prohibit through traffic from using neighborhood collectors and local strsets. Visual deterrents to through traffic will be amphasized, using physioal deterronts only as a last resort.

6. Chapter 5.0 of the General Plan, entitled "Community Image and Design," contains a subsoction 5.4.12, entitled "Development Transitions and Buffering Policies." That subsection is amended as fallows:

5.4.12 Developmant Transitions and Buffering Policles'
Minimize the number and exlent of locations where non-residential land use designations abut residentiol land use designations. Where such land use relationships use roadwaye to soparate the residential and non-residential uses*. avoided, strive to

These policies are focused on protecting existing and planned residential uses from the effects of adjacent land uses. Policies to provide similar buffers between existing and proposed developments within the ULL, and existing open space and agricultural areas are set forth in Section 10.5 of the Resource Management Element.

It is recognized that residential and non residential properties will sometimes abut atong a common property line (such as between neighborhood shopping centers and adjacent neighborhoods).
b. Ensure lhat the design of new development proposed within the ULL along a boundary belween residentlal and non-residential uses provides sufficient protection and buffering for the residential use, while maintaining the development feasibility of the non-residentlal use. The burden to provide buffers and transitions to compatibiily should ganerally be on the second use to be developed. Where there is bare ground to start from, both uses shouldd participale in providing buffers along the boundary between them.
c. Provide appropriate buffering to separate residenilal and non-rosidentiol uses within the ULL., using one or more of the following techniques as appropriote.
Increase setbacks along roadways and common property lines between residential/non- residential uses.

Provide a heavily landsceped screen along the roadway or common property line separating residential and non-residential use.

Locate noise-genorating activities such as parking areas: loading docks; and service, ouldoor storage, and trash collection areas as far from residential uses as possibie.
Where a multifamlly residential use is located adjacent along common properly lne with a non-residential use, locate the noise-generating activities of both uses (e.g.. parking areas; loading docks; and service, outdoor storage, and trash collection areas) along the common property line.

Design the residential area with cul-de-sacs funning perpendicular to and ending at the non- residential use, facilitating greater separation of residential and non-residential structures than would be possible if resicential streets ran paraliel to the boundary of the non-residential use.
d. Where a diferenco in residential density is indicatad on the Generol Plan lond use map, the size of parcels and character of development facing each other across a streetor along a common property line should be similar, creating a transition between the densities in each area.

36

e. Where multi-family development is located adjacent to a single-family noighborhood within the UL.L., appropriate buffering is le shall be provided.
Increase setbacks for muti-family devalopment along common propenty lines with single family development.

Provide heavy landscaped screen along the property line of the mutifamity
Locate noise-generating activities such as parking and trash collection areas single family neighborhood area as possible. the

f. The Iransition from lower to higher residenfal densily within tha S2l.l, should occur within the higher density area.

9. Uninterrupted fences and walls are to be avoided, uniess they are needed for a specific sareening, safety, or sound altenuation purpose.
n. Where they are needed, fences or wails should relate to both the site being deveioped and surrounding developments, open spaces, streets, and podestrian ways.

1. Fencing and walls should respect existing view corridors to the greatest extent possible.
j. Fencing and walls should incorporate landscape elements or changes in matorials, color, or texture in order lo prevent graffiti, undue glare, heat, or reflecting, or aesthelic inconsistencies.

7. Chapter 5.0 of the Genoral Plan, entilled "Community Image and Design," contains a subsection 5.4.14, enlilled "Hillside Design Policies.' Thot subsection is amonded as follows:

6.4.14 Hillside Design Policles

a. Design hillside dovelopment within.tb9.U.L.L, to be sensitive to existing terrain, views, and significant natural landforme and features.

b. Projects within hillside areas within the ULL, shall be designed to protect important natural fenturs and to minimize the amount of grading. To this end, grading plans shall conform to the following guidelines.

Slopes less than 25%:

Redistribution of earth over large areas may be permilted.
Slopes between 25% and 35%:

Some grading may occur, but landforms need to retain their natural character, Split-level designs and clustering are encouraged as a means of avoiding the need r large padded building areas.

Slopes befween 35% and 50%:

Development and limited grading within the ULL can occur only if it can be cleariy demonstrated that safety hazards, environmental degradalion, and aesthelic impacts will be avoided. Structures shall blend with the natural environment through their shape, moterials and colors. Impact of traffic and roadways is to be minimized by following naturai contours or using grade separations. Encouraged is the use larger lols, variable selbacks and variable building structural techniques such as stepped or post and beam foundations are required.

Slopes greater than 50%:
Except in small, isolated locations, development in areas with slopes greater than 50% should be avoided.

C. Manufoctured slopes in excess of five vertical feet (5*) shall be landform graded. "Landform grading* is a contour grading method which creates artificial slopes with curves and varying siope ratios in the horizontal and vertical planes designed to simulate the appearance of surrounding natural terrain. Grading plans shall identlly which slopes are to be landform graded and which are to be conventionally graded.

d. The overall project design/layout of hillside development within the ULL shall adapt to the natural hillside topography and maximize view opportunities to, as well as from the development.

e. Grading of ridgelines within the.MLL is to be avoided wherever feasible, siling structures sulficiently below ridgetines so as lo preserve unobstructed views of a natural skyline. In cases where application of this performance standard would prevent construction of any structures on a lot of record, obstruction of views of a natural skyline shall be minimized through construction techniques and design, and landscaping shall be provided to soften the impaci of the new structure.
Hillside sile design should mainlain an informal character with the prime determinant being the naturai terrain. This can be accomplished by:
utilizing variable setbacks and structure heighls, innovative building techniques, and retaining walls to blend structuras into the terrain, and

37

allowing for different lot shapes and sizes.

g. Buildings should be located to preserve existing views and to allow new dwellings access o views those enjoyed from existing dwellings.
h. Streets should follow the natural contours of the hillside to minimize cut and fill, permilting streets to split into one way stroots in steeper areas to minimize grading and bland with the terrain. Cul de-sacs or loop roeds are encouraged where necessary to fit the lerrain. On street parking and sidewalks may be eliminaled, subject fo City approvai, to reduce required grading.
Ciustered development is encouraged as a means of preserving the natural appearance of the hillside and maximizing the amount of open space. Under this concept, dwelling units are grouped in the more levet portions of the site, while steeper areas are preserved in a natural state.

j. Project design should maximize public access lo canyons, overlooks, and open: areas by:
providing open spaco easernents belween lots or the end c streets or cui-de-sacs; and
designating public palhways to scenic vistas.

Permit tho use of small rotaining structures when such structures can reduce grading, provided that these structures are located and limited in height s be a dominant visual feature of the parcel.

Where retaining walls face public streets, they should be faced with materints that help blend the wail Into the natural character of the terrain.

Largo retaining watls in a uniform plane should be avoided. Break reteining walts into elements and terraces, and use landscaping to screon them from viow.

Unacceptable Acceptable

ot lines shall bi laced at the top of slopes to facillilate maintenance by the down slope owner, who has the greater "stake" in ensuring the continued integrity of the slope.
m. The overall scale and massing of structures shall respect the natural surroundings and unique visual resources of the area by incorporating designs which minimize buik and mass, follow natural topography, and minimize visual intrusion on the natural landscope.
The overall height of a building is an important aspect of how well i fits into the existing character of the neighborhood and its hillside environment. Houses should not be excessively tall so as to dominate their surroundings or create a crowded appearance in areas of small lol: Structures should generally be stepped down hillsides and contained within a imited envelope parallel to the natural grade, rather than "hulling out" over natural slopes.
Building forms should be scaled to the particular environmental setting so as to complement the hillside character and lo avoid excessively massive forms that (ail lo enhance the hillside character.

Building facades should change plane or use overhands as a means to create changing furher t up masseve forms.
Wall surfaces facing lowards viewshed areas should be minimized through the use of single story elements, selbacks, roof pitches, and landscaping.
n. Collective mass roofines and elements should reflect the naturally occurring ridgeline silhouelles and lopographical variation, or create an overall variety, that blends with the hillside.
o. Based upon the graphic principle that dark colors recede and light colors project, medium to dark colors which blend wilh the surrounding enviranment should be used for building elevations and roof materials in view-sensitive areas.

p. Architecturat style, including materials and colors, should be compalitle with the natural selling. The use of colors, textures, materials and forms that will attract attention by contrasting or closing with other elerents in the neighborhaod is to be avoided. No one dwelling should stand out.
q. The interface between development areas within the ULL and open space is crilical and shall be given special altention. Stope plantings shoud creale a gradual transition from developed slopo areas into natural areas. By extending fingers of planting into exisling and sculptured slopes, the new landscape should blend in with the natural vegetation

38

r. Planting along the slope side of a development should be designed to allow controlled views out, yet partially screen and soften the architecture. In general, 50 percent screening wilh plan materials should be accompiished.

Trees should be arranged in informal masses and be placed selectively to recuce the scale of long, steep slopes.

Shrubs should| e rancomly spaced in masses.
Skyllne planting should be used along recontoured secondary ridgelinos to recreale the linear sithouette and to act as a backdrop for structures. Trees should be planted to create a continuous linear sühouette since gaps in the planting will not give the desired effect.
Trees that grow close the height of structures should be planted between buikdings to eliminate the open gap and blend the roof lines into one continuous silhouctte
For tire prevention purposes, a fuel modification zone shall be provided between natural open space and development.

Now development within hillside areas within the ULL, shall be conditioned upon:

the preparation and recordation of a dectaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions providing for the development and maintenance of manufactured slopes:
in the case of a parcel map or subdivision, the subdivider's supplying a program andior sloff for provontive mointonance of major manufoctured slope areas. Such program must be approved prior to approvat of a finat map, and shall include homeowner slope maintenance requirements and guidelines to be incorporated into tho declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions.

F. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT AMENDMENTS.

1. Chapter 6.0 of the Goneral Plan, entilted "Economic Development," contains a saction i Strategies of the Economic Development Element." That section is amended as follows: entitled "Goais and

6.2 GOALS AND STRATEGIES OF THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT

To provide for a sustained high qualilty of fife, thu goal of the Economnic Devalopment Element 10 accomplish the following:

Create a sound local economy that altracts investment, increases the local tax base, and genarates sulficient public rovenues to support desired municipal services and lacilties.
A strong econamy not only provides local workers wilh adequete income to afford a high quatity of life, but it also provides tocal government with sufficient public revenues to provide high levels ‹ municipal services and facilities. To achieve such a local economy requires implementation of an economic development strategy, which includes:

preparing specialized business marketing materiais;

utilizing appropriate distribution channels to reach the widest market:

targeting key industries; maintaining high web site wilh key economic and site avallability information;

improving relationships with existing local employers; maintaining business friendly reputalion;

providing appropriate incentives to aliract new businesses and facilitate expansion of existing businesses;

maintaining partnerships with local and regional business organizations;
expanding the local retail market lo maintain a fiscally strong City;
building adequate infraslructure lo maintain an invenlory of ready-to-build sites for new and expanding businesses; and

providing a mix of housing in e quality environment, including high-quality new housing on lands within the Urban Limit Line (ULL), to attract a strong labor force.
Promote a diverse range of jobs, businesses, and industries, providing high paying employment and entreprencurial opportunilies, balanced wil and well-suited to Antioch's population.
This goal reflects Antioch's commilment to increase the qualily of life ofils residents. increasing the number and types of local employment opportunilies in relation to the area's labor force is the first and most important slep toward economic self reliance. Currently, East Contra Costa's low jobs/housing ratio and the small number of localily availabie professional positions make it necessary lor 60 percent of the area's residents # commule long distances - oflen more lhan 100 miles round trip-to job centers in Pleasanton, San Ramon, Walnut Creek, Oakland, San Francisco, and the Silicon Vallay. By increasing local employment opportunities and balance belween the number and types of local jobs and residents in the labor force, Antioch residents will be better able to work

39

close to home, sponding more time with their famililes, and in leisure pursuils, while helping to reduce the traffc congestion and air pollution inherent fr those commules.
Maintain a balance of new developmont with revitalization of existing retarl locations.

To provide for a suslained high quality of life, it is the goal of the Circulation Element lo achieve and maintaln a balanced, problem-fre transportation system that:
improves present traflic flows, and provides easy and convenient access to i areas of the community,_and completes long-planned circalation improvements such as the connection of Sand Graek Road from Dallas Ranch Road to Deer Valley Roas:
is safe for all modes of motorized and non-motorized transportation;
reduces dependence on single occupant automobile travel by providing a high level of pedestrian, bicycle, and public transit travel opportunities; and

preserves a sonse of comfort and well-being throughout the community by roducing the intrusiveness of commercial, business park, and industrial traffic, rail trallic, and regional traffic on neighborhood streets and residents' quality of life.

Anticch recognizes that even by constantly expending the local roadway nelwork and providing an ongoing sequence of programmed street improvements, problems of traffic congestion will continue. Providing a real solution to traffic congestion requires a balanced approach to future transportation improvaments. An efficient transportation system neads to offer Antioch arca residents not efficient automobile troffic distribution, but also viable alternatives to aulomobile lravel. The General Plan aims to increase the batance between various modes of transportation by Increasing the desirabilily of transit, walking, and bicycling. The Generat Plan also coordinates land use, transportation, and air qualily concepts and strategies. General Plan objectives are designed to improve traffic flow, local air quatily, and energy conservation. To achieve (his of balance, the Cily of Antioch will:

provide for the efficient movement of vehicles by designing, constructing, and meintaining roadway circulation network, which will function al an acceptable level of service (LOS), as sel forth in the Growth Management Element.

expand the exisling roadway system where it is feasible to do so, such as the connection of Sand Creok Road from Dallas Ranch Road to Deer Valley Road, increesing ils carrying capacily liminaling congestion;
regulate tha intensily of future developmen! within the ULL in relation to the carrying capacily of Aniloch roadways part of ensuring I the performanco standards of the Growth Management Element are met;

42

provide mix of land uses within the ULL, that realistically balances growth in the local employment and housing, increasing local employment opportunities and reducing the need for long commutes to work:

ensure that each new development within the ULL, that would cumutatively contribute to the need for improvements provides appropriate mitgation:
providu a syslem of bicydle routes and pedastrian iinks such that pedestrian and bicycle travet becomo safer and more useful for everyday lasks such as travel to shopping, work, and recreational facilities;

achieve and maintain an organization of land uses which inlegrates places of residence, retai commerce, daily service needs, work, education, and recreation, thereby reducing the number and length of vehicular trips;

require site plans for individual development projects within the ULL to minimize or eliminate through traffic within residential neighborhoods;
to the dogree leasible, encourage mixed-user vefopments within the ULL, to reduce vehicle trips;

improve the reletionship of roadways with land uses, including regulating driveway access and development intensity where needed;
improve the carrying capacity of existing roadways through impiamentation of transportation systems management concepts:

parlicipale in developing regional circulation improvement measures in cooperation with surrounding cities and Contra Costa County. Such measures may include, but are not fimited to. the opmont of reciprocal traffic improvement feo programs: and
implement the provisions of the Contra Costa County Congestion Managoment Program by requiring development projects witbin the .Lilal, to analyzo and provide mitigation for traffic impacis on regional circulation facilities.

It ts Antioch's intent to require new developments within the ULL to mitigate their traffic impacie. either through construction of new roadways or participation in land-based financing mechanisms.

7.3.2 Vehicle Circulation Policios

a. Facilitate meeling the roadway performance stondards set forth in the Growth Management Element and improving traffic flow I roadways.

Work with the UP ond BNSF rairoads to construct grade separations along the tracks at Somersville Road, Hillerest Avenue, *A" Street, the proposed Viera Road extension, and the proposed Phillips Lane extension.
Promole the design of roadways to optimize safe traffic flow within established roadway configurations l minimizing driveways intersections, uncontrolled access to adjacent parcels, on-streel parking, and frequent slops lo the extent consislent with t character of adjacent land usos.

Provide adequate capacily al intersections to accommodete future traftic volumes by installing intersection traffic improvements and traffic control devices, as needed, as development occurs.

Fackitale the synchronization of traffic signals.
Where needed, provide acceleration and deceleration lanes for commercial access drives.
Provide for reciprocal access and parking agreements between adjacent land uses, thereby facilitating off-streel vehicular movement betwcen adjacent commercial residential uses. clher non-

Encourage regional goods movement to remain on area freeways and other appropriate routes.

b. Design and reconfigure collector and local roadways to improve circulation within and connections to residential and commercial areas.
Implement appropriate measures to mitlgate speeding and other traffic impacis in residential areas.

Implement roadway patterns that limit through traffic on local residential streets.

43

C. Require the design of new dovelopments within the ULL to focus through traffic onto arterial streels.

d. Whore leaaible, design arterial roadways, including routes of regional significance, to provida better service than the minimum standards set forth in Measure C and the Growth Management Eioment. Thus, where feasible, the Cily will ve lo maintain a "High Y" level of service (w/c-0.85-0.89) within regional commercial areas and at inters ectlons wilhln 1.000 feet of a freeway interchange. The City will also strive where foasible to mointoin Low-range "D* (v/c = 0.80-0.84) in ell other aroas of the City, including freeway interchanges.

e. Establish Assessment Oistricts in areas that will require major roadway infrastructure improvements that will beneft only that area of u City, and thereby facilitate the up-front construction of needed roadways.

f. Design intersections to ensure the safe passage of through traflic and accommodate anticipated turning movements. Implement intersection improvements consisient wilh the following Tane geometries, unless traffic analyses indicate the neod for addilional furn lanas.

H. PUBLIC SERVICES AND FACILITIES ELEMENY AMENOMENTS.

1. Chapler 8.0 of the General Plan, entitted "Public Servicus and Fuclilles," contains sectlon 8.1, enitiled "Introduction." That : lo amended : follows:

8.1 INTRODUCTION

The purpose of the Public Services and Facilities Element is to deline the types of levels of public ervices and facilities Antioch desires for its local taxpayers, and to set forth a well-conceived plan to manage the expansion of these services for a growing population and business community. The focus of this Element is providing the means to ensure that the capital facilities and public services needed ! support build out of the land uses identified in the Land Use Element, within the voter-approved Urban Limit Line (ULL), while maintaining the service standards set forth in Growth Management Element of the Antioch General Plan.

2. Chapter 8.0 of the General Plan, entitted "Public Services and Facililies." contains section 8.2, enfilled "Goals of the Public Services and Facilities Element." That section is amended as follows:

8.2 GOALS OF THE PUBLIC SERVICES AND FACILITIES ELEMENT

To provide for. sustained high quality of life, it is the goal of the Public Services and Facilitles Element to accomplish the following:
Provide for the timely expansion of high quality public services and intrastructure to serve existing and future residents businesses, rocreational focilities, ad ofher facililies within the City of Antioch within the ULL, consistent with the service levols set forth in the Growth Management Element.
Antioch recognizes that it must find a balance between the high quality and level of services desired by the communily and the financial ability of the City and other sorvice agencies to provide lhese services and infrastructure. Thus, Antioch cannot provide all the services and faclities olher agencies hi found they cannot afford to provide, nor can the City spend more on the provision of services and facilities than it recoives in revenues. Recognizing that the City cannot and should not "go it alone," the delivery of public services and facilities within the Antioch Planning Area occurs in one of three methods:
Direct Service. Certain public services and facilities are most approprietely provided directly by the City, or by contractors who provide services pursuant to standards and requirements set y the City Councit. The includo services provided directly by the City within its boundaries and within the ULL, such as police prolection. parks and recreation, water service (provided directly by the City), and maintenance of local sewer lines and streets. Solid waste collection and street construction are examples of contracted direct services.
Parinerships. Certain functions are perlormed in partnership with other organizations. in these cases, Antioch's collaborative role is performed via financial support, lechniçal assistance, coordination, or the creation of new organizations. Examples of such functions and partnerships include the provision of joint school/park sites, the Contra Costa County Transportation Commission, Melropolitan Transportation Authority, Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG), Esst Contra Cosla Regional Fee and Financing Authority, Stato Roule 4 Bypass Authorily, and the East Contra Costa Transportation Authority (Tri-Delta Transk).
Supporting the Community Agenda. In addition to services provided directly by the City and those provided in parlnership with other agencies, important public services are provided to the

46

community by spccial districts and other outside agencies. Examples of these services include schools, fire protection, sewage treatment, flood cr and solid wasto disposal. The City's role in the provision of these services is coordinating land development activifies within the ULL with the expansion services and facilities by the outside agencies provicling the services. Although Antioch does not have the final say in the provision of Services provided by outside agencies, in its role as the planning agency for the City, Antioch's policios : nd actions have subatantial capacity to assist in the provision of services to the community.
The availability of adequate public services and facillies within the ULL., including meeting the performance standards established the Growih Managoment Elament, is integral to parmitting new development. a result, if Antioch is to meel communily goals such as maintaining a high qualily of file, achieving a baiance between local housing and employment opporlunilles, and providing of a wide range of shopping and recreational opportunities, it is critical that services and faciities be expanded in a limely manner. The most direct way of ensuring the timoly expansion of services and facilities is for the City to control the provision of the public services and facitties needed to support community goals. Where such direct control is economically or administratively infeasibie, a high level of coordination with the outside agoncies provided needed and services is necessary.

12. Chapter 8.0 of the General Plan, entilled"Public Services and Faciities," contains a section 8.13, entilled *Financing Expansion of Public Services and Facitities." That section i amended follows:

8.13 FINANCING EXPANSION OF PUBLIC SERVICES AND FACILITIES
Provision of the services and facilities required by new development within the ULL, in a manner that wil not impact services and facilities enjoyed by existing residents and businesses is a key to the success of the Antioch General Plan. Sevoral basic approaches to financing the expansion of public faciities within Ihe ULl, ore available. The basic financing methods include having (1) heving developars bulld infrastructure and also provide faciilies, (2) financing faciities and infrastructure through development impact fees, and (3) use of assessment districts.
Developer financing of infrastructure is common for on-site improvements within the devolopment itself. In some cases, however, large-scale facilities are needud that will be shared by more than one duvelopment, sometimes Involving large portians of the City. When such facilities are noeded, it may be difficuit or impossible to have one daveloper construct or provide up-front financing on their own. in response, the City can offer "relmbursement agreements" to promote equity and offset the cost to Individual developers of upsizing infrastructure or providing facilities that would se ve other developments within the ULL. ursuant these reimburseinent agreoments, devalopers who provide up-tront infrastructure or facilitles that would be shared with other, future, developmont projects within the ULL would be reimbursed for this increased up-front expense by subsequant developments.
Many communities rely on devalopment impact fees lo fund such large-scale or "backbono" facilities. Development feus wurk wull at equitably spreading the cost of new facilities among those who create the need. However, development fee systems generally result in gaps between the time that facilities are needed and the time that sufficient money has been collected ito pay for them.
Development fee programs also require regular maintenance to ensure that the fees being charged are reasonably related to the impacts of individual development projects, and thal they are sufficient lo actually build the infrastruclure and facilities they are intended for.
Where multiple ownerships or developments within the ULL need to share major infrastructure, and where no individual ownership or development could reasonably efford to provide such major infrastruoture on its own, assessmont districts provide an attractive means of linancing. Antioch has successfully used large-scole assessment districts in the past, and, as a result, has nol suffered from infrastructure deliciencies to the extent that other communities have. However, the use of assessment districis can lead to situations where newer portions of the Cily receive a higher level of facilities than do older areas by virtue + ig highor toxes form of assessments) than ather portions of the City.

13. Chapter 8.0 the General Plan, entilled 'Public Services and Faclities," contoins a subsection 8.13.1, entitled "Financing Expansion of Public Services and Facilities Objective." Thai subsection is amended as follows:

8.13.1 Financing Expansion of Public Services and Facilities Objective
Ensure that the expansion of public facilities occurs in an equitable manner such that new development within the UL4, pays for all of the infrastructure and public facililles required to support the development without impacting levels of service provided to existing residents : and businesses.

14. Chapter 8.0 the General Plan, entitled "Public Services and Facilities," contains a subsection 8.13.2, entitled "Financing Expansion of Public Services and Fadiiities Policies.' That subsection is amended as follows:
8.13.2 Financing Expansion of Public Services and Facilities-Policies
a. Place the ultimate responsibillty on the sponsor of proposed development projects within the ULL for ensuring that the services and facilities needed to support the project and maintains applicable performonce standards in the Growth Management Eloment are available at the time they are needed.

c. Continue to use special assassments as a means of financing Infrastructure for future development within the ULL where the ostablishment of land-based financing would equitably spread infrastructure costs.

cl. Where permitted by law, require that special assessmonts for single-family residontial development be paid off at the time of the initial sale of homes to individuals.

C. Continue to apply existing policies and regulations prectuding City financial as sistance for any on- site capital improvements required by new development within the ULL,
f. As part of new development proposals within the ULL, determine whether any service level deficiencies might result, and place neaded conditions on the proposed development to ensure that:
Service level standards will continue to be met, and

New development within the ULL will not result in any substantial, short- or long-le reduction in the level of municipal services provided by the Cily to existing devaloped areas.

g. Encourage infill development within the ULL which utilizes existing infrestructure, as well as the planning and development of large scale, self-sufficient, mixed use communities within the ULL, with integrated phasing and financing of public facilities.

HOUSING ELEMENT AMENDMENTS.

Chapter 9.0 of tne General Plan, entililed "City of Antioch Housing Element 2015-2023,* contoins an Action 2.1.4, entitied "Executive Housing.' That Action is amended as follows:

J. RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ELEMENT AMENDMENTS.

Chapter 10.0 of the General Plan, entilled *Resource Management," contains section 10.1, entitled "Introduction." Thai section ls amended as follows:

INTRODUCTION

The focus of the Resource Management Element is on conservation and use of envronmental resources and open space issues throughout the General Plan Planning Area. While the majority of the privately owned land within the present City limits has been developed or commitled to development of urban uses within the voter-approved_Urban_Limit Line /W/L.L.). significant environmental and open space resources remain. The portion of the Planning Area outside of Antioch's present city boundarles _and ULL is largely undeveloped, and also contains significant environmental and open space resources. As Antioch expands to the soulh within the ULL, and its poputation grows, future industrial employment-generating development occurs in the northem portion of the Planning Area, as Rodgers Point a ad a shoreline trail are developed along the San Joaquin River, the need to wisely manage natural resources will become more acule. This will entail balancing such competing objectives as the need for:
Conservation of resources;

Open space preservation,

Adequate water and energy resources to support future poputations:
Providing public access to open space areas:

Expanding existing roadway and highway systems;
Ensuring housing for all economic segments of the communily; and
Ensuring economic devolopment in a manner that protects Antioch's beautifut setting and enhances the quality of life of its residents.

The Rasourco Management Eloment addresses the use, managemnent, 1 protection of environmentat resources, including open space, biological resources, air quality, waler resources, cultural resources. and energy resourcos. Combineo, these lopics cover all major aspects of Antioch's natural setling. and encompass state requirements for preparation of General Ptan Open Space and Conservafion Elemenis. In many cases, there are overltaps in the issues addressed here with ether elements of the General Plan.

52

O

For example, hillside open space issues are addressed in the Communily Image and Design Elemont (Section 5.4.14). Achieving a local balance between jobs and housing, as discussed in the Land Use and Économic Development Elements, and eliminating traffic congestion in the community are key components of maintaining good local air quality. Open space for the protection of public health and safoty is addressed in the Hazards Element, while open space for public recreation is addressed in the Public Services and Facitlties Element,

2. Chapter 10.0 of the General Plan, entitled 'Resource Management," contains a section 10.2, entitled "Goals of the Resource Managemont Element." That section Mt amended as follows:

10.2 GOALS OF THE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ELEMENT

To provide for a sustained high quality of llfe, it is the goal of the Resourco Management Element Io following:
Conserve and enhance the unique natural beauty of Antioch's physical setting, / controi the expansion of urban development by protecting open space where it is important to preserve natural environmental processes and areas of cultural and historical vatuo, including lands within the ULL, in the Sand Creek Focus Aroa west ot Deer Valley Road.
Open space provides a variety o f community bonefils, including recreation use, visual enjoymont, protection of nabitat areas, and hazard protection. In Antioch, this means protocting I San Joaquin and natural croeks, as well as their adjoining natural boaches and shorelines. It elso means opening up views of the River, and preserving views of Mt. Diablo and its foolhills to protect the beauty of the physical setling of the City.
Inhorent in Antioch's open space goal is provision of a wide range of recrealional lands and faciities, including parke for active and passive recreation, speciat purpose and multi-use trails, and praservation of the natural environment for the enjoyment of area residents.
Protection of certain types of open space is required by law. The provisions of the state and federal endangered species acts, the fedoral Clean Water Aci, and state requirements for stream alteration agreements ail require mitigation of impacts on natural habitats. The provisions of the Calfornia Environmental Quality Act also require analysis and provision of mitigation for physical impacts on habilats and cultural resources. The City of Antioch recagnizes ils responsibility to rosponsible steward for the natural environment, and to strike an appropriate balance betwuen preserving that environment and providing lands witbin.the ULL for the housing. employment, and shopping needs of an axpanding population.
Minimizo the use water and enargy resources so as to ensure a susiainable long-term supply.
The history of setllement in Callfornia - from prehistoric native villages to modem urban development - is largely tied to the availability of water. Throughout the state, groundwater resources are being overdrawn, while demands on large-scale water projects to continõe supptying urban growth increase. Presently, every major urban area of the state requires the importation of water from distant sources. Without major statewide investrnent in costly water transport facilities, growih in some urban areas may eventually need to be curtailed for lack of dependable water supplies. During major droughts in the past, public awareness of the need for water conservation grew. This awareness slacked off during wet periods. Water resource projecis for tne state indicate that the need for significant, permanent water conservation will affeci large areas of the State by 2020. Allhough the Contra Costa Water District indicales that nas sutficient water supplies committed through 2040, the City's desire to achieve a balance between local jobs and housing means that local employment growth must occur in the future at a faster raie than has previously been projected. Thus, water conservation will need to become part of Antioch's overall vision a its economic developmant program.
The availability of reliable, cheap electrical and natural gas supplles was routinely taken for granted until the summer of 2000, when costs soared and rolling blackouts hilt portions of the state. Crisis was averted with the construction of new power generaling facilities and higher energy costs. As the immediacy of energy shortages fades, so has the public's willingness to reduce onergy consumption. However, eiectricity and natural gas demands of a growing statewide poputation wi eventualily oulstrip the capacity o existing energy-generating facilities, and could plunge the state into another energy crisis. Thus, energy conservation also neods to become part of Antioch's overall vision.

3. Chapter 10.0 of the General Plan, entilled "Resource Management," contains a section 10.3, entitled *Open Space Objectives and Policles." That section is amended as follows:

10.3 OPEN SPACE OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES

As discussed in the Land Use Element, a great doai of open land remains in the Antioch Planning Area and within the UL.. pproximately 3 percent of the land within the Cily (6,383 acres) and nearly 46 percent of the land within the unincorporated portion of the General Pian Planning Area (2,240 acres) are undeveloped in open space use. Additional land (928 acres in the Cily and 381 acres in unincorporati areas) is in agricullural use. Overall, open space uses, including agriculture, opon water, recrealional lands. and vacant lands account for approximately half of the land within the City, and over 60 percent of the unincorporated land within the General Plan Study Area. Major open space areas include Black Diamond Mines and Contra l.oma regional parks, Antioch Dunes Nalional Wildlile Refuge, and municipal parklands.

Aclive Recreation Lands. City residents have access to variety of local parks, recreational facillies. regionat parks, and open spaco areas. The Cily oversees the local porks and recreational facilies, while the East Bay Regional Park District (EBRPD) oversees he regional facilifes. Tha following description of open space and recreation faclitles within the City of Anlloch is divided into four sections: parks and recreation facilities; recreation programs; special use facifties; and regional facilities and frails.

53

The City owns and administers 28 parks, varying in size and amenities from the 2-acre Deerfield Park to the 99-acre Prewett Family Water Park. Over 400 parks and open space arcas are located within the City, 200 acres of which are developed. The remaining 200 acres consist of acreage awalting developmoni o reas managed axclusively as open space.
The East Bay Regional Park Oistrict operates three facilities in the Anlioch area, tho largest of which is Black Diamund Mines Regional Preserve, a 5,984-acre open space area accessed by muitiple use trails (1.e., pedestrian, bike, and equestrian trails). The Proserve offers noturalist programs, and visitors can tour the underground mining museum and a historic cemetery. Picnic areas and horse staging areas are also avallable. Two wilderness group camps are located in the southern portion of the park. Acditional open space preserves are located to the southeasl of Antioch adjacent to the L.os Vaqueros reservoir and within the Coweil Ranch, which has recently become a State Park.
Contra Loma Regionat Park, adjacent to the Lone Tree Golf Course on the southern edge of the City, is 775 acres in size. The park surrounds the Contra Loma Reservoir, and offers multipte use-trails for hiking, biking, and horseback riding. The reservoir is available for fishing, boaling, saiboarding, and swimming (In a separate swim lagoon). The Park olso provides picnic areas, horseshoe pits, and a food concession stand. EBRPD also maintains the Antioch Regional Shoreline, which consists of 7 acres fronting the San Joaquin River, north of downtown Antioch. The Shoreline has a 550-foot long fishing pier, a smell beach, cnic lables and barbeques, and a 4.5-acre meadow. Swimming is not allowed a the Antloch Regional Shoreline Park.

The EBRPD also oversees the Delta DeAnza Regional Trail, which originates at Bay Point in the West Plisburg area, and runs east lo a connection with the Marsh Creek Trail in Oakley, with a connection to the Iron Horse Trail (hrough the Concord Navat Weapons Station along the Contra Costa Canal Right of Way. The Trait crosses Antioch from its western boundary with Piltsburg ot approximately Somersvill Road, paraliels the Contra Costa Canal to Wild Horse Road at Hillcrest Avenue, and runs to the Union Pacific Railroad tracks at Neroly Road in Oakley. An agreement with the railroad to permit a trail crossing is preventing the trail from baing opaned. wnen oponed, the Delta de Anza Trail wil extend from the Marsh Croek Trait in Brontwood to the iron Horse Trail in Concord. The segment through Antioch is also pait of the De Anza National Historic Trail.

Agriculluro. Antioch is located in an area of Contra Costa County that has traditionally contained areas of land used for grazing, orchards, field and row crops. The City has approximately 5,600 acres of grazing and former agricultural lands.

Passivo Opon Space. Passivo open space in and near the City of Antioch consists of hillsides, vacant lands, and the San Joaquin River. Viows of natural features both within the City and of the surrounding topography ary a valuabio rosourco for many of the City's residents. Natural features that can be viewed trom the City incude Mt. Diablo, the surrounding ridgelines, and the San Joaquin River. These views contribute a feeling of community identily, as well as visual enjoyment.
The Cily is located on the southern bank of the San Joaquin River, near its confluence wilh the Sacramento River. The confiuence of these rivers is located in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, an area that is largely level, with views lo the north and east. To preserve open space and viows along the River, and to attract residents down to the aroa, the City has developed projects such as the Municipal Pubilc Marina (built in 1988) and the Antioch Riverfront Promenade.
In 1981, the City enacted the Hillside Planned Development (HPO) Ordinance to protect hillsides, ridges, and ridgelines within the City. The Ordinance was revised and adopted in 1994 as part of the Zoning Ordinance and applies to thoso hiltside areas ch one or more of the following apply:
A predominant portion of the area has slopes in excess of 10 percent;
A significant area of slopes of 25 percent or greater; or
A significant ridgeline, hilltop, or exposed slope is located in the area.
The purpose of the Ordinance i: to promote a moro hamonious visual and functional relationship between the natural and built environments. The HPD Districts are reserved for residential uses that are ciustered in a manner that will preserve significant features of hillside areas, such as drainage swales, streams, sleep slopes, ridgelines, rock outcroppings, and native vegetation.
As of 1998, the City had three HPD Districts located in the south and southwest portions of the City. This land could be developed or redeveloped at any time with uses as specified in the General Plan or Zoning Ordinance. Areas designated, currantly or in the tuture, as HPD Districis will be developed and should not be considored permanent passive open space. However, these areas will be developed in a manner which preserves valued open space characlerislics.
Chapler 10.0 of the General Plan, entitled "Public Services and Facililies," contains a subsection 10.3.1, entilled *Open Space Objeclive."' That subsection is amended as follows:
10.3.1 Open Space Objective
Maintain, preserve and acquire open space and its associaled natural resources by providing parks for active and passive recreation, trails, and by preserving existing atural, scenic, and other open space resources gutside the ULL..

5. Chapter 10.0 € the General Plan, entitled "Public Services and Facilities," contains a subsection 10.3.2, entitled "Open Space Policies." That subsection is amended as follows:

10.3.2 Open Space Policies

a, Establish a comprehensive system of open space that is available to the public, including faciities for organized recreation; active informai play; recreational travel along formal, natural, and rivertront trails; passive recreation; and onjoyment of the natural environmant.

b. implement the design standards of the Communily Image and Design Element so as to maintaln viewe of the San Joaquin River, Mount Diablo and its foothills, Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve and other sconic features, and protect the natural character of Antioch's hilside areas : t forth in the Community Image and Design Element'
Policies related to viewshed prolection are set forth in Section 5.4.2, General Design Policies. Hillside design polices are found ii Section ! 4.14

Maintain the shoreline of the San Joaquin River as an inlegraled system ol natural (wellands) and recreational (trails and viewpoints) open space as sel 35 forth in the Land Use Element and Pubilc Services and Facilities Element.

d. Where significant natural features e present (e.g, ridgelines, nafural creeks and other significant habitat areas, rock outcrops, and olher significant or unusual landscape features), require now development within. the UL.L, to incorporate natural open spaco areas into project design. Require dedication to a public agency or dedication of a conservation easemnent, preparation of maintenanco plans, and provision of appropriate long-term management and maintenance of such open space aroas.

0. Require proposed developmont projects within the ULL containing significant natural resources (e.g. sensitive or unusuel habitais, special-status species, habitat linkages, steep slopes, cultural resources, | 1 fire hazards, elc.) to prepare Resource Management Plans to provide for their protection or preservation consisient with the provisions of the Antioch Generat Plan, othor local requiremente, and the provisions of Stato and Federat law. The purpose of the Resourci Management Plon is to took beyond the logat status of species at the time the plan is prepared, and provide a long-term plan for conservation and management of the natural communities found onsite. Resource Management Plans shall accomplish the following.
Dotormino the eignilicanco of tho rocourcos thot are found onsita and their relationship lo resources in the surrounding area, including protected open space areas, habitat linkages an wildlife movement corridors;

Defino areas that are to be maintained in long-tern opon space based on the significance of onsite resources and their relationshipl in the surrounding area, and

Establish mechanisms to ensure the long tem prolection and management of lands retained in open space.

Encourago public access to creck corridors Ihrough the estabiishment of trails adjacent to riparian resources, while maintaining adequate buffers between creaks and trails to proteci sensitive habitats, special-status species and water quality to the maximum extent feasible. However, Irails shall not impair appreciably the quantily or quality of water or native vegetation in o stream corridor.

9. Where feasible, incorporate preserve and protect significant existing natural features as part of the design of new development projects within the ULL rather than removing them, Where preservation of natural features i: i not feasible, introduce naturat elements into project design, impacis to significant natural features that cannot be preserved or reintroduced into the project design on-site be mitigated off-sile.

6. Chapter 10.0 of the General Plan, entitled "Resource Management," contains a section 10.4, entitled "Biological Resources Objectives and Pollcies.* That section is amended as follows:

10.4 BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
Atthough il is largely urbanized, portiong of remaining undeveloped tands within the ULL. that have long been planned for development contain vegetation and hahilat types the Colifornia Department of Fish considers rare and worthy of consideration in the California Nalural Diversity Detabase:

Native grassiands

Vernal pools

Stabilized interior dunes

Seasonal wetlands

Freshwater seeps

Freshwater marshes

Coastal brackish marshes

Alkaline lloodplains

55

Alkali seeps

Valloy oak woodlands

Riparian woodland

Grassland. Native grasslands have been reduced to 90 percent of their former area in Calfornia. Native grassland in the Antioch Planning Aree would be dominated by purple needlegrass (Nassella puchra). A variety of spring wildflowers are aiso found in native grassiands. Because of the rarily this once abundant vegetation type, the California Department of Fish and Game may request miligation for projects that impact nalive grassiands. Additionally, special-stalus ptants are more likely to be found in undisturbed native vegotation. Native grassiands are most likely to be found scatlered in the southern part of the Antioch Planning Area. A number of special-status species has been idenlified in certain nativo and non-native grassland habitets within and adjacent to Antioch, including San Joaquin kit fox (Vulpes macrotis), California tiger salamander (Ambystoma calilomiense), American badgor (Taxidea laxus), western burrowing owt (Athene cunicularia hypugca), and goiden cagle (Aquita chryseatos).
Vernal Pools. Vernal pools are seasonal wellands typically ocourring in depressions in grasslands. These depressions collect water during the winter and spring reins, and dry once the rains cease. As tho ponds dry in the spring, a succession of different plant species bloom around the edgas of the poot. A high-qualty vernai pool will display concentric rings of different colors of flowers in bioom in mid-spring. Because vernal pools tend to be isolated from each other, they may possess a unique flora that includes special-status, federally protected plants and special-status animals. Vernai pools are most likely to bi found in the southern portion of the Antioch Planning Area. Special-status plants and invertebxates aro often found within thiss hobitat type.
Stabilized Interior Dunes, The Antioch Dunes along the banks of the San Jonquin River contoin a uniquo assemblage of plant and animal species, several of which are found nowhore else in the world. Scaltered grassos and forbs, some of which reach shrub size, form tho ground covor. The foderally endangered Antioch Dunes evening-primrose (Oanothera deltoides ssp. howelli) and Contra Costa wallower (Erysimum capitatum ssp. angustotum) are found here amongst more common species. number of spocial-status animals occur in this habitat, the most sensilive of which are the insects, including the federally endangered Lange's metalmark butterily.
Wetlands. Seasonal wetlands and ponds hold water for only part of the year, and can be found in any port of the Antioch Planning Area, but ara more common along tho San Joaquin Rivar and seasonal streomo in the southorn portion of the Planning Arca. Coastal brackish marshes a year round and are found along the banks of the San Joaquin River., If pickleweed (Salicomia sp.) ls present, coastal brackish marshes may contain suitable habitat for tne State and Federally endangered sait marsh harvest mouse. Other lisied species associated with the coastal brackish marsh in the Antioch Planning Area include California clapper rall (Rallus longirostris obsolotus). California black rail (Laterallus jamaicensis coturnicutus).

Aikaline floodplains exist along the banks of the San Joaquin River. These may appear barren because of the difficulty of growing in highly alkaline, frequenlly disturbed soi. If unprotected, such barren lands tend to attract people secking recreation in four-wheei drive vehicles, which reduces the vegetation ever - further. Stands of pickleweed and saltgrass growing within alkaline floodploins can te habitat for the State and federally endangered salt marsh harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys revivontris).

Open Water. This category indudes the San Joaquin River and permanent waterbodies, such as natural or man-made lakes. ponds, and reservoirs. Although open water does not provide habitat for many plant species, i important for wildlife and fish. The San Joaquin River is used as a movement corridor, foraging, and breeding habitat for a variety of native and non-native fish including steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss), Chinook salmon (Öncorhynchus tshawytscha), delta smell (Hypomesus transpacificus), striped bass (Morone saxafilis), and many others. Water birds and waterfowls use the takes and rivers for foraging and breeding and stopovers during migration.
Oak Woodland. Oak woodlands are important habitat for numerous common and special-stalus wildlife species. Blue oak woodland is found on north-façing slopes and in shady ravines in the Mt. Diablo foothills. Volley oak woodlands onco dominated the edges of the Centrat Valley in vast perk-like stands. Valley oaks are the largesl and longest-lived of the California oaks. This habital type has been much reduced by conversion of land lo agriculture and because modern grazing palterns prevent the regeneration of young oaks. Valley oak stands are still found in Anlioch in Contra Loma Regional Park and other southern portions of the Antioch Planning Area.

Riparian. Riparian vegelation refers to the nalive scrub or forest occurring along streams and riverbanks. In riparian areas, the roots of trees and other vegetation can easily reach the water lable. Such areas are prone to frequent flooding. Riparian vegetation used found along most perennial and interrillent streams in the Antioch Planning Area and along the San Joaquin River. This vegctation type has become rare due to disturbance by cattle, riverfront development, and the filling or channelizing of small streams in urban areas. Riparian areas provide imporiant breeding and foraging habilat for many species of birda, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians. The federally-listed California red-legged frog (Rana aurora draytonif) occurs along creeks in the Planning Area and the state-lisled Swainson's hawk will nest in lorge frees such as cottonwoods that grow along creeks.

Special-Status Species. Special-status species are deined as:

Species (hat are tisted, or designated as candidates for listing, as threalened or endangered under the Federal Endangered Species Act;

Species that are listed, or designated as candidales for listing as rare (plants), threatened. or endangered under the California Endangered Species Act;

Plant species on List 1A, List 1B, List 2, and List 3 in the California Native Plant Society's Inventory of Raro and Endangered Vascular Plants of California:

56

Wildlife species listed by the California Department of Fich and Game as species of spocial futly protected species;
Spocios that meet the definition of rare or endangored under the California Environ-mental Quality Act (under Section CEQA%); and

Considored to bo a taxon of special concern by local agencies.
This section of CEQA Guidelines stales thal any species not included on any formal list, can nevertheless be considered rare or endangered if the species can be shown to meet the criteria for listing.

Chapter 10.0 of the General Plan, entilled *Public Services and Facilities," contains a subsubsection 10.4.2. entilled "Biological Resources Policies." That subsection is amended as follows:

10.4.2 Biological Resources Policies
a. Comply with the Federal policy of no net loss of wetlands through avoidance and clustered development. Where preservation in place is found not to be feasible (such as where a road crossing cannot be avoided, or where shore stabilization or crention of shoreline trails must encroach into riparian habitats), require 1) on-sile replacement of welland arcas, 2) ff-site replacement, or 3) restoration of degraded wettand areas at a minimum ratio of one ocre ‹ replacement/restoration | habitat is roplaced. acre of impacted onsite habitat, such that the value of Impacied

b. Preserve in place and rastore existing wettands and riparian resources along the San Joaquin River and other natural streams in the Planning Area, except where a need for structural flood protection is unavoidable.

C. Eor now.dovelepment.within.tho.Ul.L., require Require appropriate setbacks adjacent to natural sireams to provide adequate buffer areas ensuring the protection of biotogical resources, including sonsitive natural habitat, special-status species habitats and water quality protaction.
d. Through the project approvai and environmental review processes, require new development projecia within the UZLL l protoct sansitive habitat areas, including, but not limited to, oak woodlands, riparian woodland, vernal pools, and native grasslands. Ensure the preservation in place of habitat areas found to be occupled by state and federally protectod spocies.
If impacts to sensitive habitat areas are unavoidable, appropriate compensatory mitigation shall be required off-site within eastern Contra Costa County. Such compensatory mitigation shall be implomented through the provisions Resource Management Plan ("RMP*) as described in Policy 10.3.2.e, except where, in the discretion of the Community Development Director, en RMP is not necessary or appropriate due to certain characteristics of the site and the project. Among the factors that are relevant to determining whether an RMP Is necessary or approprlate for a given project are the size of the project and the project site, the location of the project (e.g., proximitly to axisting urban development or open space), the number and sensitivity of biological resources and habitats on the project site, and the nature of the project (e.g., clensity and intensity of development).
Where proserved habitat areas occupy areas lhat would olherwise be graded as part of : development project within the ULL, facititate the trensfer of allowable density to other, non- sensilive portions of the site.
e. Limit uses within preserve and wilderness areas to resource-dependent activities and other uses compatible wilh the protection : I habitats (e.g., passive recreation and public tralls).
Through tho project review process for now development within the ULL. review, permit the removal ct healthy, mature oak trees on a case-by-cose basis only where it is necessary to do so.

11.5.2 Fire Hazard Policies

Where new development within the ULL borders wildland arcas. requre appropriale fuel modification and use of fire retardant building materials per the requiremenis of the Contra Cosla County Fire Prolection District. Fuel modification may be permitled to extend beyond the boundaries of the site for which wildland fire protection is being provided only if the adjacent owner provides written permission, the proposed luel modification is consistent with the manegement practices of the agency controlling such land (if it is in permanent open space), and the off-site fuel modification activity will not significantly impaci sensitive habillat areas.
b. Require that adequate fire protection be available at initial project occupancy, whenever feasible. Thus, stations should be constructed and manned st the outset of new devolopment. If the Contra Cosla Fire Protection District finds that a lag time between inilial occupancy and operation of new

62

stations cannot be avoided, the City may consider requiring sprinkiers in new homes as an alternative.

6. Chapter 11.0 of the General Pian, entitled "Environmental Hazards," contains a subsection 11.6.2, entilled "Noise Pollcies.' That subsection is amended as follows:

11.6.2 Noise Policies

b. Maintain a pattern of land uses that seperates noise-sensitive land uses from major noise sources lo the extent possibie, and guide noise-tolerant land us o the noisier portions of the Planning Arca.
c. Minimize motor vohicte noise in residential areas through proper route location and sensilive roadway design.

Provide planned industrial areos with truck access routes separated from residential areas to the maximum feasible extent.

Where needed, provide traffic calming devices to slow traffic speed within residential neighborhoods.

Noise Analysis and Mitigation

Where new development within tha.ULL (inciuding construction and improvement of roadways) is proposed in areas exceeding the noise levels identified il the General Pian Noise Objective, or where the development of proposed uses could result in a signilicant increase in noise, requiro o detailed noise atlenuation study to be prepared by a qualified acoustical engineer to determine appropriate mitigaton and ways to incorporate such miligstion into project design and implementation.
When new devolopment within the ULL incorporating potentially significant noiso generator i proposed, require noise enalyses e prepared by a qualified acoustical enginoor. Require the implementation appropriate noise mitigation when the proposed project wil cause new exceedences of Goneral Plan noise objectives, or an aucble (3.0 dBA) increase in noise in areas whore General Plan nolse objectives are already exceeded as the resull of existing development.
In reviewing noise impacts gf new developmant within the ULL.. utilize site design and architectural design features to the extent feasible to mitigate impacts on residential neighborhoods and olher uses that are sensitive to noise, in addition lo sound barriers, design techniques to mitigate noise impacis may include, but are noi lmited to:

• Increased building setbacks to increase the distance between the noise source and sensitive receptor.

Orient buildings which are compatible with higher noise levels adjacent to noise generators or in clusters to shield more noise sensitive areas and uses.

Orient delivery, loading docks, and ouldoor work areas away from noise-sensitive uses.
Place noise tolerant use, such as parking areas, and noise tolerant structures, such as garages, batween the noise source and sensitive receptor.
Clustor office, commercial, or multi-family residential struciures to reduce noisa levels within interior open space areas.

Provide double glazed and double paned windows on the side of the structure facing a major noise source, : nd place entries away from the noise source to the oxtent possible.
g. Where feasible, require the use of noise barriers (walls, berms, or a combination thereof) to reduce significant noise impacis.

Noise baniers must have sufficient mass to reduce noise transmission and high enough to shield the receptor from the noise source.

To be effective, the barrier needs to be constructed without cracks or openings.

The barrier must intorrupt the line of sight between the noise source 1 noise receplor.

The elfects of noise "Nanking" the noise barrier should be minimized by bending the end of the barrier back from the noise source.

Require appropriate landscaping treatment to be provided in conjunction with noise barriers to mitigate their potential aesthetic impacts.

h. Continue enforcement of California Noise Insulation Standards (Tille 25. Section 1092, Casfornia Aoministrative Code).

L. IMPLEMENTATION ELEMENT AMENOMENTS.

1. Chopter 12.0 of the Goneral Plan, entitled "Implementation," contains a section 12.2, entitled "Follow-Up Studes and Actions." That section is amended, effective January 1, 2021, upon the expiration of Measure K, as follows:
12.2 FOLLOW-UP STUDIES AND ACTIONS

a. Zoning Ordinance

As result of updating the Antioch General Plan, a number of modificalions to previous General Plan land use designations are proposed. These modifications to proposed land uses are primarily located within Plan Focus Areas. As a resull of these dificalions, not all lands will have zoning consistent with the General Plan, in addition, the General Plan contains provisions calling for modifications of zoning slandards.

California Government Code Section 65060 requires that a city's zoning be consistent with its General Pian'. Where a city has undertaken a comprehensive updale of ils General Plan, case law permits th cily . I reasonable period 1 time to chango its zoning ordinance (zoning map and lext) to achieve consistency with its updated Generai Plan.

This requirement exiends to general taw cities, such as Antioch. Exceptions are made for charter cities.

The following implementation programs will be undertaken in relation to the City's zoning ordinanco.
1. Revise the zoning map lo reflect the land use calegones of the adopted General Plan, indluding zoning of lands within focus areas.

2. Prepare a matrix defining the zoning classifications that are considered to be consistent with each General Plan designation.

Revise the text of the zoning ordinance to reflect the provisions of the adopted General Plan in relation following issues.
Modify permilted uses wilhin zoning designations to refleci the delincation of appropriate uses sel forth in the Land Use Element.

Establish development standards for mixed-use buildings within the downtown area and within transit-oriented development nodes. Typically, a mixed-use building would consist of

64

residental dwelling units placod
uses on the ground floor. the upper fioors of buildings having commercial or office

Modify zoning standards to refleci appropriate locations for churches and schools as set forth the Land Use Element.

Add requirements for the provision of charging stations for electric commercial and employment-generaling developments. in major

Establish standards for boot storage yards, including standards for slackable storago.
Establish density bonuses for senior housing projects.
Establigh standards/ the development of rosidentiai care facilities.
Modify zoning standards to incorporale standards for open space transitions and bulfers.
b. Development Review Process

Antioch's development review process involved examining proposed devolopment projects for their conformance with the following.

policies sot forth in the Genaral Plan:

the xotar:annroved Urban Limit Line (U
developmant standards set forth in the zoning ordinance and (where epplicable) subdivision ordinunce:

the provisions of any applicable specific plan;
for rosidentiat projects, the provisions of Anlioch's residential growth management program;
and the provisions of (he City's economic developmont strategy.
Goneral Plan Consistency Review. New devolopmont projocis within the ULL that roquire discretionory actions by the City will be reviewed for consistency with the provisions of the General Plan, including the General Pian land use and circulation maps and all applicable General Plon goals, objectives, and policies. The City will not approve any development project found lo be inconsistent with the provisions of the General Plan or of the ULL.

Sce also "Resolution of Competing Objectives" under Section 12.4d.
Zoning Review. The City's zoning ordinance sets for a description of specific pemitted uses and development standards needed to implement the General Plan. All proposed development within the ULL will be roviewed to ensure that the requirements and standards of the City's zoning ordinance are met.

Subdivision Revlew. Whenever a proposed developmeni within the ULL, requires division of fand inio separate parcels, such development shall be subject to the provisions of the City's subdivision ordinance. This ordinance sets forth both procedural and substantive requirements for the division of land within the City, implementing both the Antioch General Plan and the California Subdivision (Map Act. All divisions of land within e City shall be required to meet the provisions of the City's subdivision ordinance and the Map Act.

Environmental Review. The provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) require public agencies to review the polential environmental impacts of discretionary actions they proposed to undertake prior to actuaily undertaking those actions, including review of proposed development projecte The Cily will maintain review guidelines in accordance with CEQA and Stale guidelines to impiement CEGA. Environmental review of Individual projects (public and private) within the ULL will entail preparation of sufficient technical data to determnine consistency wilh Genersl Plan policles rolated to the physical environment, including, but not limited to, traffic, noise, air quality, biological and cultural resources, public services ond facllities, availability of energy and water resources, visual impacts, and fooding and geotechnical hazards.
As part of the environmental review process, miligation measures needed to achieve consistency with the provisions of the General Plan will be applied to proposed projects.
c. Maintain Adequate Municipal Serviocs and Facilities

ARTICLE 42: WEST SAND CREEK PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT
§ 9-5.4201 Purpose.

A. The West Sand Creek Master Plan District ("West Sand Creek" or "WSC District") was enacted by the "West Sand Creek Open Space Protection, Public Safety Enhancement, and Development Restriction Initiative" to implement the General Plan's stated vision for the development of the land in the Sand Creek Focus Area west of Deer Valley Road inside the existing boundaries of the voter-approved Urban Limit Line ("ULL"). In particular, the West Sand Creek District zoning standards apply to the Limited Development Area established by the Initiative.

B. The West Sand Creek District provides flexible development standards designed to ensure the development of the District as a master planned community. The WSC District shall be defined principally by single-family residential of various lot sizes on flalter areas on either side of Sanid Creek, within the Limited Development Area, along with natural and recreational open spaces. The development standards applicable to the WSC District are provided below.
C. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Antioch Municipal Code ("Municipal Code"), and to ensure that development within the WSC District is subject to express, objective standards that cannot be changed through subsequent discretionary actions or interpretations without the consent of the landowner pursuant to the provisions of the Initiative, the West Sand Creek District shall be and is deemed a new zoning district that exists independent of other zoning requirements, including the balance of Title 9. Land reguiated by the WSC District shall not be subject to any other provision of the Municipal Code that purports to regulate or guide land use or zoning, except those contained in this Article 42.

D. No development shall ocour within the West Sand Creek District unless it is consistent with the initiative and this Article 42. If an application is presented for development that is consistent with the Initiative, this Article 42, and objective grading and building standards of Title 8 of the Municipal Code that are applicable to all development in the City of Antioch, then the application shall be ministerially granted. Certificates of occupancy shall also issue ministerially provided only that construction conforms to City-wide (o building and grading requirements for issuance of such certificates, and to the regulations of WSC District. With the exception of subdivision maps and architectural design review, no additional approvals or entitlements, including but not limited to departmental review approval, conditional use permit, land use permit, minor use permit, any approval of requirement of the growth management ordinance, development plan, planned development, variance, zoning clearance, minor use permit, or any other review or entitlement purporting to regulate or guide land use or zoning shall be required by the City to develop the project described in such application unless otherwise specified in the tables of permitted uses below.

The site is identified by Assessor's Parcel Numbers (APNs) 057-010-002-4, 057-010-003-2, and 057-021-003-9.

The proposed project site consists of 551.5 acres of primarily undeveloped land, designated for Golf Course Community, Senior Housing, and Open Space in the City of Antioch Gencral Plan (see Figure 3). is The site is zoned Study Area (S) per the City of Antioch Zoning Ordinance (see Figure 4). The project site is surrounded by single-family residential subdivision to the north, undeveloped land to the south (planned for future residential), Deer Valley Road and Kaiser Permanente Antioch Medical Center to the
cast, and undeveloped land and Empire Mine Road (planned for future residential) to the west.

PROJECT SITE CHARACTERISTICS:

The project site consists of on-site (referred to as the "projcct sitc") impact arcas. The 551.5-acre project site is comprised of primarily undeveloped land, designated for Golf Course community, Senior Housing, and Open Space in the City of Antioch General Plan. Currently, the site includes a cattle-grazing operation, a single-family residence, and various barns and outbuildings located on the eastern portion of the site. Historical uses of the site include grazing and limited natural gas exploration. Sand Creek, tributary of Marsh Creck, flows west to cast through the proposed project site. The topography of the site is varied, ranging from relatively level arcas in the eastern and central portions of the sitc, gently-sloping hills immediately north and south of Sand Creck, and moderate to steep slopes in the western portion of the site. A large stockpile of soil and large boulders is situated on is the northern portion of the proposed project site, near the terminus of Dallas Ranch Road. The stockpiles are likely the result of construction activities associated with Dallas Ranch Road and the existing single-family, medium density residential
subdivision located to the north of the site.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

The applicant is proposing to amend the general plan, and construct multiple single-family residential neighborhoods, various public facilitics and amenities, and circulation and access improvements, as well as associated infrastructure improvements to serve the proposed planned community. The proposed project includes two scenarios: : Multi-Generational Plan and a Traditional Plan. The Multi-Generational Plan would include a wide range of housing, including active adult housing, whilc the Traditional Plan would include only all-ages housing, and would not include active adult housing. The project applicant is requesting approval of both scenarios to allow flexibility based upon market conditions. The following provides a summary of the project's primary components.
General Plan Amendments: Per the Cily of Antioch General Plan, the proposed project site is located within the Sand Creek Focus Area, and is designated Golf Course Community, Senior Housing, and Open Space. The proposed project would include a General Plan Amendmnent to the

The Ranch Project A2

Land Use Map to change the land use designations of the site to Low Density Residential, Medium Low Density Residential, Mixed Use, Public/Quasi Public, and Open Space for the Traditional Plan. The GPA for the Multi-Gencrational Plan would designate a portion of the site as Senior Housing (see Figure 5 and Figure 6). In addition, both scenarios would include text and map changes to the Circulation Blement of the General Plan. The amendment to the Circulation Flement of the General Plan would to shift the proposed alignment of Dallas Ranch Road and its connection to Sand Creck Road north of Sand Creck.

Zoning Code Amendment: The proposed project site is currently zoned S per the City of Antioch Zoning Ordinance. The project would require a zoning amendment to change the zoning designation of the projcct site from S to Planned Development (PD) (see Figure 7). The PD ordinance would include development standards specific to the proposed project site.
Neighborhood Concept: The two proposed scenarios would provide a mix of different single family residential neighborhood types organized into two distinct development areas to the north and south of the Sand Creek corridor. Both the Multi-Generational Plan and the Traditional Plan would include identical layouts for the north development area; however, the plans would diffcr subtly in the layouts for the south development area (see Figure 8 and Figure 9). Proposed land uses, densities, and lot sizes of both plans are shown in Table 1 and Table 2.
o North Development Area: The north development area would include Medium Density (MD) and Low Density (LD) neighborhoods. A five-acre commercial "Villagc Center"
would be located at the northwest corner of Dccr Vallcy Road and Sand Creck Road. South Development Area (Multi-Generational Plan): Under the Multi-Generational Plan, the south development area would compromise of three distinct residential neighborhoods, including two low-density "executive" neighborhoods (LD-1 and LD-2) and an Active Adult (AA) neighborhood. All three neighborhoods would be gated. o South Development Area (Traditional Plan): Under the Traditional Plan, the south development area would include an additional LD-2 neighborhood in place of the AA neighborhood proposed in the Multi-Generational Plan.

Public Facilities and Amenities: •The proposed project includes the development of public facilities and public recreational amcnities, including open space and trails, parks, and a firc station site.
o Open Space and Trails. The proposed project would preserve the existing Sand Creck corridor, as well as various hills and ridgeline areas in the northwestern and southwestern portions of the project site, as open space. A comprehensive public trail system would be provided along Sand Creek and throughout the project site. The trail system would connect the proposed neighborhood areas to cach other and to nearby parks, ridgeline areas, trailhead staging areas, and the proposed mixed-use Village Center area. o Parks: The proposed project would include five public neighborhood parks, ranging from 1.5 to 6 acres, as well as numerous pocket parks that would gencrally be smaller than one
acre.
North Neighborhood Park: Within the north development area (under cither development scenario), the proposed project would include a five-acre park (North Neighborhood Park) and a five-acre, 100-foot wide
adjacent to the east side of the north neighborhood park. linear parkway
Homestead Park: A 2.5-acre park would be located between the two MD arcas along Sand Creek Road (under either development scenario). Homestead Park would be situated at the site of the existing on-site grazing operation, would overlook Sand Creek and would provide public trail access to the Sand Creek
trail system for residents of the northern development area. Active Adult Community Park: Under the Multi-Generational Plan, the active adult neighborhood would have an approximately four-acre park (Active Adult Community Park), which could include a cluh house with pool, tennis courts and bocce ball courts, as well as lawn areas and walking paths. Hillside Park: The Executive Neighborhood would include an approximately 1.5-acre park (Hillside Park) that would connect to the proposed trail system and include a common area and vista point with views of Mount Diablo. O Fire Station. A two-acre site for a future fire station would be located to the east of Iomestead Park and across from the proposed Villagc Conter arca. The firc station is not

The Ranch Projcct A4

proposed to be constructed as part of the proposed project, but will be studied in the Project EIR.
Circulation, Parking and Streetscape: The proposed project would include construction of a four- lane arterial roadway (Sand Creek Road) that would connect the existing terminus of Dallas Ranch Road on the northwestern portion of the proposed project site to the existing terminus of Sand Creek Road at Deer Valley Road, immediately south of the Kaiser Permanente Antioch Medical Center. The connections at Dallas Ranch Road and Deer Valley Road would provide the primary access points to the project site.
A secondary access point would be provided at the existing signalized intersection at Deer Valley Road and Wellness Way. Wellness Way would be extended into the project site as a two-lane a street (Strect A) with a center landscaped median, terminating at Sand Creek Road. Street B, a four-lane arterial road, would connect to the roundabout at Sand Creek Road and extend southward to the southern boundary of the project site, terminating in a second roundabout. Street C would extend westward from Street B towards the western site boundary.
Internal local residential streets would include 10-foot roadway lanes, bordered on each side by a seven-foot horizontal parking lane, a five-foot landscaped setback, and a five-foot-wide sidewalk. Bach residential unit would have two spaces in an enclosed garage. If streets abutting the residential units do not include strect parking, guest parking would be provided at a rate of one space per five residential units.
A11 major streets would include a five-foot bicycle lane. In addition to the bicycle lancs, the proposed project would include the construction of a seven-mile off-street trail system. In addition, 10-foot wide pedestrian/bicycle bridge would be constructed across Sand Creek near the Homestead Park site.

Utilities and Infrastructure: Public utilities, including potable water, sanitary sewer, stormwater drainage, power, and telecommunication services, are not currently provided on the project site. The following section describes how the proposed project would improve the site to provide standard services:
o Water Service: Potable water would be distributed to the project sitc by cxisting transmission mains a and would complete a looped connection through the proposed project site. An approximately 16-inch primary water line would be located in Sand Creek Road and would connect to the existing City water main at Dallas Ranch Road, a and a second connection would be located at the existing 20-inch water main in Deer Valley Road. Other major streets throughout the proposed project site would contain approximately eight- to 12-inch water lines.
O Sanitary Sewer: The proposed project would include the installation of a 12-inch sewer main, as well as a number of smaller eight-inch sewer lines throughout proposed project site. The connection point for the 12-inch sewer main would be located approximately 1.5 miles cast of the project site in Heidorn Ranch Road. An off-site extension of the existing 18- to 24-inch sower line would be required to provide the proposed project with sewer service.

O Stormwater: All stormwater runoff within the proposed project site would be treated on-
site by two proposed stormwater detention basins and would discharge into Sand Creek through two new storm drain outfalls. The northernmost détention basin would be approximately nine acres in size and would be located south of Sand Creek Road, north of the Sand Creek. The second basin would be approximately 7.5 acres, and would be located south of Sand Creek. Both stormwater detention basins would discharge treated

The Ranch Projeet A5

stormwater through engineered outlets to Sand Creek. The detention basins would provide detention, treatment, and hydromodification.
O Power and Communications: Electricity to the project site would be provided by PG&E. AT&T and Comcast would provide voice and data communication services to all development in the site. Existing distribution lines would be extended to individual parcels within the project site as development occurs. Dry utilities, electrical, gas, and technology would be located underground, and would tie in to existing infrastructure located at the terminus of Dallas Ranch Road and an cxisting substation approximatcly one-half mile south of the existing Hillcrest Avenue/Prewett Ranch Drive intersection.
Phasing: Buildout of the project would occur over the course of a number of ycars, as dictated by the cconomy and demand for new housing in the area. The project would be constructed in phases, with the infrastructure and amenities corresponding to new unit demands. While the
phases have not yet been determined, the project site would be built out starting from cast to west and from north to south. A phasing plan would be submitted with the first tentative map application for the project site.

PROJECT ENTITLEMENTS AND APPROVALS:

Requested project entitlements are anticipated to include the following:
General Plan Amendments: The project would require the approval of General Plan text and map amendments to the Land Use Element to change the land use designations of the site from Golf Course Community/Senior Housing/Open Space, Hillside and Estate Residential, and Public/Quasi Public to Low Density Residential, Medium Low Density Residential, Mixed Use, Public/Quasi Public, and Open Space. The Multi-Generational Plan would designate a portion of the site as Senior Housing. The Circulation Element of the General Plan would be amended (text and map) to reflect the proposed alignment of Sand Creek Road. Zoning Code Text and Map Amendments. The project would require text amendments to rezone from the current zoning, Study Area (S), to Planned Development (PD). The PD would include special development standards for the project.
Design Guidelines. The design guidelines would supplement the proposed development standards.
Resource Management Plan. Pursuant to section 4.4.6.7(() of the City of Antioch General Plan, the applicant will prepare a Resource Management Plan for City approval. Development Agreement. The Development Agreement would assure the City that the proposed project would proceed to its completion in compliance with the plans submitted by the applicant, and assure the applicant of vested rights to develop the project.
