22 and DAVID KOSTERS (collectively, "Petitioners") hereby petition the Court for a writ of mandate and

23 declaratory and injunctive relief ordering defendant and respondent East Bay Regional Park District
24 (*Park District") to rescind its approval on March 21, 2017 and entry on March 22, 2017 into a

25 Memorandum of Understanding ("Tree Removal MOU") with real party in interest Pacific Gas and
26 Electric Company ("PG&E"). The Tree Removal MOU allows PG&E to remove 245 healthy, mature

27 and in many cases, iconic old growth oak, redwood and other native trees • including at least 31 trees

IFIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT . 1 -

Sections 6-1701 to 6-1713 - without preparation of the environmental reviews required by the California

2 Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq. ("CEQA") and without

3 compliance with other state and municipal laws protecting the environment, and in violation of the

4 statutory, municipal and constitutional rights of petitioners to adequate notice. By this First Amended

5 Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and for

6 Attorneys' Fees ("Amended Petition"), Petitioners allege as follows:

7 INTRODUCTION

8 1. This is a public interest citizen suit to enforce CEQA, the Planning and Zoning Law,
Government Code section 65000 et seq. ("PZL"), the California Constitution's Due Process section

10 (Article 1, section 7), the City of Lafayette's General Plan and Tree Protection Ordinance, and the Park

11 District's land use and environmental laws including Ordinance 38. CEQA is California's preeminent
12 environmental law. It requires all public agencies to examine the potential adverse impacts of their

13 actions before taking them. It is designed to protect California's extraordinary environmental resources

14 from uninformed and needlessly destructive agency actions. The PZL is California's comprehensive

15 land use planning law that assures that local land use and resource development decisions are consistent

16 with the governing general and specific plans and applicable zoning and environmental protection

17 ordinances such as the City's Tree Protection Ordinance. Compliance with the PZL and the Park

18 District's land use and environmental laws assures that the publicly reviewed and adopted land use goals,

19 policies and programs for the City and the Park District are honored and implemented rather than

20 ignored and violated. California's Due Process section - Article I, section 7 - guarantees that each

21 Californian "may not be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law" including duly

22 noticed, fair hearing in which each person has an opportunity to present evidence and arguments before a

23 public agency may take administrative action, such as the Park District's entry into its MOU with PG&E,

24 without public notice and review under CEQA and other applicable laws, that harms that person's

25 protected property rights.

26 2. Contrary to these statutory, municipal, Park District and constitutional protections of

27 Petitioners' - and - the public's - rights, on March 21, 2017 the Park District Board of Directors purported

28 to approve on its consent calendar Agenda Item "1.g." whose entire description in the Park District's

|FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 2 -

posted online agenda was: "Authorization to Accept Funding from PG&E's Community Pipeline Safety

2 Initiative for Environmental Restoration and Maintenance at Briones Regional Park and Lafayette-

3 Moraga Regional Trail." But unbeknownst to the public, including Petitioners, this benign-sounding

4 "Authorization to Accept Funding . for Environmental Restoration and Maintenance" had nothing to

5 do with environmental restoration. Instead, it approved the Tree Removal MOU allowing PG&E to cut

6 down 245 healthy, mature and in many cases, iconic native trees that define, protect and 'enrich public

7 and private open space of inestimable value to the thousands of people who use and enjoy Park District

8 lands, or reside near them. Trees to be removed include scores of massive and venerable coastal live
oaks, valley oaks, coast redwoods, California buckeyes, and other protected native tree species located

10 within the popular Briones Regional Park, along the popular Lafayette-Moraga Regional Trail, and in

11 other public open space owned by the Park District and highly valued for its scenery and wildlife habitat.

12 The Park District failed to provide petitioners and the public with required public notice before it entered

13 into the Tree Removal MOU with PG&E. The Park District's approval of the Tree Removal MOU

14 without notice to petitioners and without any review under CEQA evaded the detailed environmental

15 analysis required by CEQA, the comprehensive planning review mandated by the City of Lafayette

16 Municipal Code provisions including Title Six, sections 6-205, 6-211, 6-215 and 6-225, governing

17 planning and land use of public and private lands within the City's boundaries, and the Park District's

18 own land use and environmental controls including Ordinance 38, and violated the public notice and fair

19 hearing commands of the California Constitution.

20 3. Although not disclosed in the Park District's highly misleading Agenda notice about

21 "Funding for Environmental Restoration and Maintenance," and therefore unknown to the public and

22 Petitioners, the sole basis for the Park District's entry into the Tree Removal MOU was a false and

23 misleading propaganda campaign rolled out by PG&E touting the supposed benefits of implementing its

24 "Community Pipeline Safety Initiative" ("CPSI'). According to PG&E's marketing campaign, the CPSI

25 reflects PG&E's commitment "to the safety of its customers and the communities it serves" and is
26 intended to "clear areas around pipelines of trees so that first responders and crews have immediate

27 access, the pipe can be properly inspected, and tree roots do not damage the pipe."

28 4. In fact, none of the three ostensible purposes of the CPSI is true. As attested by a Fire

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 3 -

Captain with the San Ramon Fire Protection District and other qualified fire suppression professionals,

2 first responders would not remove trees or their roots in responding to a threatened or actual natural gas
explosion or fire. Instead, they would "isolate and deny entry" to the affected area and wait until the

4 pipeline's automatic shut off valve (or PG&E itself) shut off the gas, and PG&E conducted the repairs.

5 Second, the gas lines in question are already accessible to vehicles along the Lafayette-Moraga Regional

6 Trail, the Briones Regional Park Rim Trail, and other pipeline locations on Park District land where

7 PG&E proposes to remove healthy and mature trees. Third, PG&E had never presented to the Park

8 District adequate documentation of a single instance where tree roots created a hazard for gas pipelines.
9 To the contrary, a study PG&E conducted of this issue in 2014 concludes that "[a]vailable data provides

10 no direct evidence that the presence of live tree roots in contact with the [gas] pipe increased the

11 susceptibility to the initiation of stress corrosion cracking," "[a]bove ground [pipeline] surveys are not

12 significantly affected by the presence of tree roots," and "the effectiveness of External Corrosion Direct

13 Assessment (ECDA) does not appear to be adversely affected by the presence of tree roots."

14 5. PG&E's motivation for its CPSI appears instead to be a desire to reduce the cost of

15 monitoring the condition of its gas pipelines by facilitating much faster - but far less exacting - pipeline

16 examination from the air rather than from the ground. Monitoring by air is neither as accurate nor as

17 complete as monitoring by ground, resulting in less rather than greater public safety.

18 6. Although PG&E has implied that the CSPI is intended to assure the public that PG&E has

19 "learned its lesson" from the catastrophic September 2010 San Bruno gas pipeline explosion caused by
20 its criminal negligence, the facts do not support this claim. According to the National Transportation

21 Safety Board investigation of that explosion, its probable cause was a substandard and poorly welded

22 section of pipeline installed in 1956, coupled with PG&E's 96-minute delay in shutting off the gas

23 supply after the explosion had occurred. Cutting down the Park District's heritage trees does nothing to

24 address the actual hazards posed by PG&E's gas pipelines, many of which were installed decades ago

25 and lack operable and reliable shut-off valves and other essential safety features. Thus, rather than

26 improving public safety, PG&E's CPSI is intended to reduce PG&E's costs of pipeline maintenance and

27 may expose the public to greater safety hazards due to less effective aerial (rather than ground)

28 monitoring and reduced lateral and subjacent soil support for pipelines in areas where live tree roots help

2 Creek.

3 7. Petitioners bring this action in order to vindicate the public's statutory and constitutional

4 right to public notice and the Park District's compliance with CEQA's command that agencies carefully

5 cxamine the environmental impacts of their projects before approving them, the PZL's requirements that

6 the use of lands within the City of Lafayette comply with its General Plan and implementing land use

7 ordinances including its Tree Protection Ordinance, and the tree protections set forth in the Park

8 District's land use and environmental laws including Ordinance 38. Contrary to these mandates, the

9 Park District approved the Tree Removal MOU without first providing public notice, conducting CEQA

10 review, and complying with applicable land use laws.

11 8. Petitioners ask this Court to order the Park District to rescind its unlawful decision to

12 approve the Tree Removal MOU, and to direct the Park District to provide the public notice, and

13 compliance with CEQA and the Park District's and the City's land use procedures and standards, that are

14 required by law before taking any further action on PG&E's Tree Removal MOU.

15 JURISDICTION

16 9. This Amended Petition is authorized by Code of Civil Procedure sections 472 and 1085 et

17 seq. and Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5.

18 10. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 388 and Public Resources Code section

19 21167.7, petitioners are serving the California Attorney General with a copy of this Amended Petition
20 concurrently with the filing of this Amended Petition, and consistent with Public Resources Code section

21 21167.5, Petitioners previously served the Park District, the City and PG&E with notice of this suit.

22 PARTIES

23 11. Petitioner Save Lafayette Trees is a non-profit unincorporated association whose members

24 reside, work, or recreate in the City of Lafayette and use and enjoy the healthy, mature native trees on

25 Park District lands that PG&E proposes to cut down pursuant to its Tree Removal MOU with the Park

26 District. Save Lafayette Trees has collected more than 2,000 digital signatures supporting its opposition

27 to PG&E's proposed removal of trees in the City and on Park District lands. Save Lafayette Trees and

28 its members are therefore beneficially interested in the Park District's compliance with CEQA, the PZL,

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 5 -

1 the City's General Plan and Municipal Code, the Park District's Ordinance 38, and the California

2 Constitution in connection with its approval of the Tree Removal MOU, and accordingly seek this

3 Court's writ of mandate, and injunctive and declaratory relief, enforcing these laws and overturning the

4 Park District's unlawful approval of the Tree Removal MOU.
12. Petitioner Michael Dawson is a City resident and homeowner and the President of Save

6 Lafayette Trees. He and his family regularly use and enjoy the healthy, mature trees that PG&B proposes

7 to remove pursuant to the Tree Removal MOU and therefore have a vital and direct interest in the Park

8 District's compliance with the laws governing that MOU, and accordingly seek this Court's writ of

9 mandate, and injunctive and declaratory relief, enforcing CEQA, the PZL, the City's General Plan and

10 Municipal Code, the Park District's Ordinance 38, and the California Constitution, and overturning the

11 Park District's unlawful approval of the Tree Removal MOU.

12 13. Petitioner David Kosters resides in the City with his family and is the Secretary of Save

13 Lafayette Trees. He and his family regularly use and enjoy the healthy, mature trees that PG&E proposes

14 to remove pursuant to the Tree Removal MOU, and a therefore have a vital and direct interest in the Park
15 District's compliance with the laws governing that MOU, and accordingly seek this Court's writ of

16 mandate, and injunctive and declaratory relief, enforcing CEQA, the PZL, the City's General Plan and

17 Municipal Code, the Park District's Ordinance 38, and the California Constitution, and overturning the

18 Park District's unlawful approval of the Tree Removal MOU.

19 14. Respondent East Bay Regional Park District is a public agency authorized by the California
20 Legislature in 1933 and approved by the voters residing within the Park District in 1934. It encompasses

21 65 regional parks, recreation and wilderness areas, shorelines, preserves and land bank areas totaling

22 approximately 121,000 acres in Contra Costa and Alameda Counties. Its "Core Mission" is to "acquire,

23 develop, and maintain a high quality diverse system of interconnected parklands which balances public

24 usage and education programs with protection and preservation of our natural and cultural resources."
25 http://www.ebparks.org/about#profile. It is subject to the requirements of the California Constitution,
26 CEQA, the PZL, the City's General Plan and Municipal Code and the Park District's Ordinance 38 in

27 connection with its approval of the Tree Removal MOU with PG&B. The Park District is specifically

28 forbidden from taking action that would "interfere with control of any .. property that [is] owned or

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 6 -

1 controlled by a municipality ... in the district, except with the consent of the governing body of the

2 municipality ... and upon such terms as may be mutually agreed upon between the board of directors of

3 the district and the governing body." Public Resources Code §§ 5541, 5541.1.

4 15. Real Party in Interest Pacific Gas and Electric Company ("PG&E") is a corporation
organized under the laws of California in 1905. It purported to enter into the Tree Removal MOU with

6 the Park District on March 23, 2017, and the Tree Removal Agreement with the City of Lafayette on

7 April 26, 2017. Because it is a "corporation," PG&E is a "person" within the meaning of that term as

8 defined in section 102 of the Park District's Ordinance 38, and therefore subject to the land use

9 restrictions and prohibitions set forth therein, including, for example, its prohibition against actions that

10 "damage, injure, collect or remove any plant or tree or portion thereof, whether living or dead located

11 on District parklands." Id. § 804.

12 16. The true names and capacities of respondents DOES 1-100, inclusive, are unknown to

13 Petitioners who therefore sue such respondents by such fictitious names pursuant to Code of Civil

14 Procedure section 474. Petitioners will, with leave of court if necessary, further amend this Amended

15 Petition when the true names and capacities of said DOE respondents have been ascertained.

16 17. Petitioners are unaware of the true names and capacities of real parties in interest sued

17 herein as DOES 101- 200, and sue such real parties in interest herein by fictitious names. Petitioners are

18 informed and believe, and based on such information and belief allege, that the fictitiously named real

19 a parties in interest have a financial or other beneficial interest in the Park District's approval of the Tree

20 Removal MOU. When the true identities and capacities of these real parties in interest have been

21 determined, petitioners will, with leave of the Court if necessary, further amend this Amended Petition to

22 insert such identities and capacities.

23 LEGAL BACKGROUND

24 CEOA

25 18. CEQA is California's primary statutory mandate for environmental protection. It applies to

26 all state and local agencies, and requires them to "first identify the [significant] environmental effects of

27 projects, and then to mitigate those adverse effects through the imposition of feasible mitigation

28 measures or through the selection of feasible alternatives." (Sierra Club v. State Board of Forestry

IFIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 7-

(1994) 7 Cal.4th 1215, 1233.) Its most important substantive imperative requires "public agencies to

2 deny approval of a project with significant adverse effects when feasible alternatives or feasible
3 mitigation measures can substantially lessen such effects." (Sierra Club v. Gilroy City Council (1990)

4 222 Cal.App.3d 30, 41.)

5 19. CEQA'S mandate for detailed environmental review "ensures that members of the

6 [governmental decision-making body] will fully consider the information necessary to render decisions

7 that intelligently take into account the environmental consequences" of their proposed action. (Mountain

8 Lion Foundation V. Fish and Game Commission (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 133; Public Resources Code

9 §§ 21080.5(d)(2)(D), 21091(d)(2); 14 C.C.R. [CEQA Guidelines] ("Guidelines") § 15088.) The CEQA

10 process thus "protects not only the environment but also informed self-government." (Citizens of Goleta

11 Valley v. Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564.)

12 20. All California "public agencies" must comply with CEQA when they approve discretionary

13 projects. (Public Resources Code § 21080(a).) The Park District is both a "public agency" and a "local a

14 agency" as those terms are defined in CEQA. (Public Resources Code §§ 21062, 21063.) Therefore the

15 Park District is subject to CEQA. (Id.)

16 21. A proposed governmental action requires environmental review under CEQA if (1) the

17 agency is contemplating an "approval" of an action as defined by Guidelines section 15352, (2) the

18 subject matter of the contemplated approval constitutes a "project" under Public Resources Code section

19 21065 and Guidelines section 15378(a), and (3) the project to be approved does not fall within a
20 statutory exemption created by the Legislature under Public Resources Code section 21080(b) and

21 recognized under Guidelines sections 15260-15285, or a categorical exemption in the Guidelines as
22 promulgated by the California Resources Agency pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21084(a)

23 and Guidelines sections 15061(b)(2), 15300-15333 and 15354.

24 22. Even if a project is subject to a categorical exemption, it is subject to CEQA if it falls within

25 an exception to the categorical exemptions as provided under Public Resources Code section 21084 and

26 Guidelines section 15300.2. If a project is not exempted by statute or regulation, then it may nonetheless

27 be exempt from CEQA only if "it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility that the activity in

28 question may have a significant effect on the environment." (Guidelines § 15061(b)(3) (the "common

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 8 -

1 sense" exemption).)

2 23. If a local agency such as the Park District is considering approval of a project that is subject

3 to CEQA, then it must prepare an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") if the project "may have a

4 significant effect on the environment." (Public Resources Code § 21151(a).) In determining whether a

5 project may have such an effect, the gency must engage in a "three-step" process for determining how

6 to proceed. (Guidelines §§ 15002(k), 15061, 15063-15065, 15070, 15081.)

7 24. First, assuming that the agency has determined that a proposal it may approve does in fact

8 constitute a "project," then the agency must determine whether the project is subject to a statutory
exemption, a categorical exemption, or the "common-sense" exemption. (Guidelines § 15062.)

10 25. Second, if the project is not exempt from environmental review, then the agency must

11 prepare an "initial study" to determine the level of environmental review that is required for CEQA

12 compliance. (Guidelines § 15063.) In doing so, the lead agency (such as the Park District here) must

13 consult "informally" with responsible and trustee agencies, who may offer recommendations as to

14 whether an EIR or negative declarations should be prepared. (Guidelines § 15063(g); Public Resources

15 Code § 21080.3(a).) If the agency concludes that a negative declaration or a mitigated negative
16 declaration, rather than an EIR, is the appropriate environmental document, then the initial study must
17 set forth the agency's reasoning in reaching that conclusion. (Guidelines § 15063(c)(5).)

18 26. The third and final step for the agency in applying CEQA depends on the conclusions of the

19 initial study. If the initial study and public comment thereon show that there is no substantial evidence
20 (or reasonable inferences therefrom) that the project may cause significant adverse environmental

21 impacts, then the agency must adopt a "negative declaration." If the initial study reveals substantial

22 evidence that significant impacts might occur, but that the project applicant is able and willing to modify

23 the project to eliminate all such potential or significant impacts, then the lead agency should adopt a

24 "mitigated negative declaration" confirming that, as mitigated, the project clearly has no potential for
25 causing a significant effect on the environment. (Public Resources Code §§ 21064.5, 21080(c)(2);

26 Guidelines §§ 15006(h), 15064(f)(2).) If the initial study and public comment thereon indicate that there

27 is substantial evidence that one or more significant environmental impacts may occur, and the project

28 proponent is either unwilling or unable to mitigate them to insignificance, then the lead agency must

|FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 9 -

1 prepare an EIR analyzing those effects and suggesting feasible means, if any, of mitigating or avoiding

2 them including alternatives that would achieve most of the basic objectives of the project without

3 causing significant environmental effects. (Public Resources Code §§ 21002, 21002.1, 21061;

4 Guidelines §§ 15080-15096, 15120-15132, 15160-15170.)

5 27. In applying these CEQA procedures, an agency may not segment a project to avoid

6 preparing an EIR on the entirety, or whole, of the project. (Guidelines § 15378(a), (c), (d).) CEQA's

7 "requirements cannot be avoided by chopping up proposed projects into bite-size pieces which,

8 individually considered, might be found to have no significant effect on the environment or to be only

9 ministerial." (Plan for Arcadia, Inc. V. City Council of Arcadia (1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 712, 726.)

10 28. The final step in the CEQA process is public notice of any CEQA approval. A public

11 agency must provide adequate notice when it "approves or determines to carry out a project that is

12 subject to [CEQA]." (Public Resources Code § 21108; Guidelines § 15062(c)(1); County of Amador v.

13 El Dorado County Water Agency ("County of Amador") (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 962-965.) When a

14 local agency files a notice of exemption ("NOF") confirming approval of a project that is allegedly

15 exempt from CEQA, that notice "shall be filed with the county clerk of each county in which the project

16 will be located." (Guidelines § 15062(c)(2) (emphasis added).) A similar notice must be given when a

17 local agency files a notice of determination ("NOD") confirming approval of a project that is subject to

18 CEQA. (Guidelines § 15075(d).)

19 29. CEQA has a strong policy against applying a short limitation period where as here, the

20 agency fails to provide the public notice that is required to trigger CEQA's shorter - 30 to 35-day -

21 limitations periods. International Longshoremen's & Warehousemen's Union v. Board of Supervisors

22 ("International Longshoremen's") (1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 265, 271-274 (CEQA's 180-day limitations

23 period applies where agency's notice failed to substantially comply with CEQA); County of Amador, 76

24 Cal.4th at 962 ("If a notice of exemption is not filed, or is defective in a material manner, the limitations

25 period is extended to 180 days after the project is approved"); Lewis v. Seventeenth Dist. Agric. Assn.

26 ("Lewis") (1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 823, 834 ("the overriding consideration, for claims under CEQA, is
27 notice;" because "filing notice ... shortcut[s] the statute of limitations from 180 to 35 days ... it is

28 even more imperative the notice is filed and posted locally"); Citizens of Lake Murray Area Assn. V. City

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 10 -

1 Council ("Lake Murray') (1982) 129 Cal.App.3d 436, 440-441 (actual posting of public notice is

2 required to commence the running of CEQA's statute of limitations because of CEQA's "legislative

3 intent to encourage public participation and to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment").

4 And, CEQA's 180-day limitations period only runs from adequate public notice of the agency's approval

5 of the actual project, rather than approval of an inchoate, unexplicated, or materially altered project.

6 (Concerned Citizens of Costa Mesa v. 32nd Dist. Agricultural Assn. (1986) 42 Cal.3d 929, 939; Ventura

7 Foothill Neighbors v. County of Ventura (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 429, 436-437.) Consequently where,

8 as here, the agency fails to provide adequate or accurate notice of the project it is proposing to approve,
CEQA'S 180-day statute of limitations does not commence until petitioners discover or reasonably

10 should have discovered the actual project that was approved.

11 PLANNING AND ZONING LAW

12 30. California's Planning and Zoning Law ("PZL") is set forth in Government Code sections

13 65000 et seq. It governs land use planning, zoning and related development permit processes in counties

14 and general law cities such as the City of Lafayette. It requires local governments to adopt

15 comprehensive general plans, and requires that land use planning decisions be consistent with them.
16 (Government Code section 65300 et seq.) It also governs the procedures for, adoption of general and

17 specific plans and other land use controls, and prescribes the public notice required for their approval.

18 (Government Code section 65090 et seq.) The PZL directs that each general plan shall include a land

19 use element, circulation element, housing element, conservation element, open space element, noise

20 element, safety element, and environmental justice element. Each plan must be internally consistent, and

21 zoning and subordinate land use decisions and permits must be consistent with the general plan.

22 (Government Code sections 65300.5 and 65860.)

23 31. Because the "general plan is atop the hierarchy of local government law regulating land

24 use," local governments such as the City must "proceed [in the manner required by] their general plan."

25 (Neighborhood Action Group v. County of Calaveras (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 1176, 1183 (first quote);

26 C.C.P. § 1094.5(b) (second quote).) And, before allowing PG&E to remove trees on the Park District's

27 lands located within the City of Lafayette and subject to the City's Tree Removal Ordinance, the Park

28 District as a land owner subject to the City's land use regulation, must not "interfere with control of any

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT -11•

property that [is] . . . controlled by a municipality . . . in the district," such as the City of Lafayette.
2 Public Resources Code §§ 5541 and 5541.1. PG&E likewise is subject to the City's police powers over

3 land uses within its jurisdiction - despite its protestations to the contrary - as evidenced by its entry into

4 its Tree Removal Agreement with the City on April 26, 2017. The requirement that all approvals

5 allowing land uses - including decisions allowing the removal of trees such as the Park District's

6 approval of its Tree Removal MOU with PG&E and the City's approval of its Tree Removal Agreement

7 with PG&E, respectively - must be consistent with the applicable general plan
8 "is necessarily to be implied from the hierarchical relationship of the land use laws. To view them in order: a use permit is struck from the mold of the zoning law ([Government
9 Code section] 65901); the zoning law must comply with the adopted general plan (§

10 65860); the adopted general plan must conform with state law (§§ 65300, 65302). The validity of the permit process derives from compliance with this hierarchy of planning laws. These laws delimit the authority of the permit issuing agency to act and establish
11 the measure of a valid permit A permit action taken without compliance with the

12 land use laws is ultravires as to any defect implicated by the uses sought by the permit."

13 (Neighborhood Action Group, 156 Cal.App.3d at 1184 (emphasis added).)

14 32. In accordance with the PZL, the City has adopted a General Plan that contains several

15 elements that establish goals, policies and programs to protect public health and safety and
16 environmental resources. As summarized in its Introduction, the General Plan is premised on and

17 implements four Guiding Principles, the first and third of which are particularly pertinent here and direct

18 as follows:

19 1. "Preserve and enhance the character of Lafayette as a semi-rural community."

20 ek

21 3. "Protect the natural and scenic quality of our surrounding hillsides and ridgelines, creek

22 areas, trees and other vegetation."

23 (City of Lafayette General Plan, as adopted by Resolution 2002-56 on October 28, 2002, Introduction,

24 page 1.) Consistent with the foregoing "Guiding Principles," the General Plan repeatedly emphasizes the

25 importance of the City's "[u]nique . .. magnificent natural setting," and "stresses the protection of
26 Lafayette's natural beauty" including "preservation of the scenic quality of the surrounding hills." (Id.)

27 The General Plan calls out for specific recognition and protection

28 "[t]he City's natural terrain - undeveloped hillsides, generous spans of open space, mature

IFIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 12 -

hl

2 oaks, natural creeks and numerous tributaries, and spectacular scenic viewsheds . . . Complementing this foothill environment are the Lafayette Reservoir and the area's trail

3 system, including the nation['s] first rail-to-trail project - the Lafayette-Moraga Trail."
(Id. (emphasis added).)

4

5 33. Consistent with and to implement the General Plan's Guiding Principles for protecting the

6 City's "unique . . . magnificent natural setting" including its "undeveloped hillsides, general spans of

open space,

7 mature oaks . . . and spectacular scenic viewsheds," the General Plan's Open Space and

8 Conservation Element repeatedly emphasizes "the vital role that open space plays in defining the
character of the community and our quality of life." Its Policy OS-1.3, for example, requires the City to

10 "[p]rotect areas of special ecological significance, including . . . woodlands, wildlife corridors [and]

11 riparian areas . . . ." (City of Lafayette General Plan, Open Space and Conservation Element, adopted by
Resolution 2002-56 on October 28, 2002, at III-3.)

12

13 34. Similarly, Lafayette General Plan Policy OS-1.5 requires the City to "[p]reserve, protect,
and where necessary, restore open space for wildlife habitat to

14 assure the continued viability and health

15 of diverse, natural animal and plant communities." (Id.) This Element calls out for particular

16 recognition and protection Lafayette's notable "oak woodlands," and "[a]long creeks and streams, [the

17 City's] riparian woodlands, where a variety of larger oaks, walnut, California buckeye, cottonwood and

18 bay trees thrive." (Id. at III-6.) These irreplaceable open space areas provide habitat for "thirteen

19 Sensitive Plant Species and ten wildlife species that are classified as sensitive or endangered by either

20 the state or federal government." (Id.) "Groves of trees" in particular are identified as "a valuable
resource to the community." (Id.)

21

22 35. The City's Open Space and Conservation Element contains specific policies intended to

23 protect the City's large, healthy and iconic native trees. For example, Policy OS-4.3 requires that the

24 City "Ip]reserve existing woodlands and their associated vegetation." (Id.) Likewise, Policy OS-4.4

25 directs that the City must "Ip]rotect important groves of trees and significant existing vegetation." (Id.)
36. To assure proper implementation of the General Plan's policies requiring protection and
26 preservation of existing woodlands and their important groves of trees, the General Plan contains

27

28 numerous Programs of particular relevance to this lawsuit. Program OS-4.3.1, for example, requires the
City to "[e]xpand the City's Tree Protection Ordinance to include protection for significant native trees

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 13 -

1 and woodlands." (Id. at III-7 (emphasis added).) Similarly, Program OS-4.4.1 "[r]equire[s] that site

2 planning, construction and maintenance of new development preserve existing healthy trees and native

3 vegetation to the maximum extent feasible." (Id. (emphasis added).)
37. The General Plan's Parks, Trails and Recreation Element likewise recognizes the

5 importance of "large areas of open space" managed by the East Bay Municipal Utilities District and the

6 Park District that "constitute a major part of the beautiful natural setting of the City." (City of Lafayette

7 General Plan, Parks, Trails and Recreation Element, adopted by Resolution 2005-56 on October 28,

8 2002 and amended in part by Resolution 2008-36 on July 28, 2008, at IV-1.) These regional open space

9 areas include "Briones Regional Park .. operated by the East Bay Regional Park District," which

10 "provides hiking, equestrian and picnic facilities" for community members. (Id.)

11 38. This Element also recognizes the importance of the City's extensive open space trail

12 system:

13 "Trails offer scenic views, commute alternatives and recreational opportunities. Lafayette

14 has an extensive system of trails provided by the City, the East Bay Regional Park District and the East Bay Municipal Utilities District."

15 (Id. at IV-4.) This General Plan element recognizes in particular the importance of the Lafayette-Moraga

16 Regional Trail, which includes lands owned by the Park District and was "the first 'rails to trail'

17 conversion of its kind (dedicated in 1978) ...." (Id.) The City's extensive "trails system as shown on

18 the Lafayette Master Trails Plan provides access to public places and to scenic vistas that represent a

19 significant natural amenity to the community." (Id.)

20 39. Against this backdrop of the City's overarching and abiding interest in identifying and

21 protecting the City's open space resources, including its riparian woodlands and other important groves

22 of native tree species, in 2003 the City adopted its Tree Protection Ordinance, which it strengthened in

23 2010. (Lafayette Municipal Code chapter 6-17, adopted in Ordinance No. 539 § 1 (2003) and amended

24 by Ordinance No. 593 adopted March 22, 2010.) The City's Tree Protection Ordinance explains its

25 purpose as follows:
26 "The City of Lafayette consists of oak woodland and savannah covered hills and valleys

27 that originally contained many large and majestic orchards and creeks lined with giant valley oak, madrone, buckeye and black walnut trees It is now recognized that the

28 preservation of trees enhances the natural scenic beauty, increases property values, encourages quality development, aids in tempering the effect of extreme temperatures,

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 14 -.

L

2 helps to reduce air and noise pollution, furnishes habitat for wildlife and gives Lafayette an identity and quality that enhances the environment for all residents and the business

3 community. As seen in the master and specific plans adopted by the city, trees are vital to the community . The general plan has goals and policies for the preservation of the

4 community's biological resources, including its trees, and it is the purpose of this ordinance to implement these goals and policies.'

5 (Lafayette Municipal Code, Title 6, Section 6-1701(a) (emphasis added).)

6 40. To this end, the City's Tree Protection Ordinance directs that:

7

8 "The policies of the city are to protect existing woodlands and their associated vegetation, protect native trees, preserve riparian habitat, encourage the planting of native species, and avoid the cutting of mature trees.
9 (Id. at Section 6-1701(b) (emphasis added).)

10 41. Accordingly, the City's Tree Protection Ordinance directs that:

11

12 "It is a violation of this chapter for any person to remove or destroy a protected tree without a category I or category II permit under Sections 6-1706 or 6-1707, or without the approval of an exception under Section 6-1705."

13

14 (Id.) Each of these sections prescribes detailed procedures that the City must follow and investigations it

15 must conduct before deciding whether to issue a permit allowing the removal or destruction of a
protected tree. Category I permits are required for any removal or destruction of a tree on property not
16 associated with a development application; a category II permit is required to remove or destroy a

17

18 protected tree on property that is associated with a development application. (Id.)

42. The Tree Protection Ordinance allows only limited exceptions to its coverage, and
19 prescribes a detailed, discretionary process that must be followed before the City may grant any person

20

21 an exception to the requirements of this Ordinance. (Id.) Section 6-1705, which governs exceptions,

22 prescribes a discretionary permit process whereby the City evaluates each exception request under five
criteria. (Id.)

23

24 43. Consistent with its "Core Mission" summarized in Paragraph 14 above, the Park District has

25 adopted a Master Plan governing management of Briones Regional Park, and other Park District lands

26 within the City of Lafayette. It provides that the Park District's "role in managing vegetation to preserve

27 and improve native habitat values is key to the health and biodiversity of these important public natural

28 reservations." (Park District Master Plan 2013, at page 40 (emphasis added).) To implement this Master
Plan, the Park District has adopted Ordinance 38, which sets forth its land use rules and regulations for

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 15 -

1 Park District land. Ordinance 38 provides in pertinent part in Section 804 that "[n]o person shall damage|

2 or remove any plant or tree or portion thereof, whether living or dead . located on District

3 parklands." Ordinance 38 provides further in Section 808 that "[n]o person shall cut . .. any tree . .. in

4 the District." (Id.)

5 44. The prohibitions against cutting or removing trees set forth in Sections 804 and 808 are

6 subject to exception only when "special permission" is granted pursuant to Section 807. Section 807

7 provides in turn that "[s]pecial permission [as defined in Section 103] may be granted to remove, treat,

8 disturb, or otherwise affect plants . for research, interpretive, educational, or park operational
purposes." (Id. (emphasis added).) The Park District's approval of the Tree Removal MOU with PG&E

10 advances none of these specific purposes. Moreover, no authorized special permission was ever granted

11 to PG&E for the tree removals purportedly allowed by the Tree Removal MOU.

12 DUE PROCESS SECTION OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION

13 45. Article I, section 7 of the California Constitution provides in pertinent part that "[a] person

14 may not be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law...." (Id.) This provision

15 has been broadly construed by California courts to a encompass a right to a fair hearing in proceedings

16 before an administrative body. (Nightlife Partners, Ltd. V. City of Beverly Hills (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th

17 81, 90.) The sine qua non of a fair hearing is notice reasonably calculated to apprise those directly

18 affected by a proposed agency decision of the opportunity to appear and present evidence and argument

19 with regard to the proposal. (Horn v. County of Ventura (1979) 24 Cal.3d 605, 616-618.) And, persons

20 such as petitioners and their members whose property interests are potentially harmed are entitled to

21 have the agency make its decision only after hearing the public's views, and based on evidence in the

22 public record rather than extra-record evidence obtained ex parte from the party proposing the harmful

23 land use, such as PG&E. (English v. City of Long Beach (1950) 35 Cal.2d 155, 158; Franz v. Board of

24 Medical Quality Assurance (1982) 31 Cal.3d 124, 138-140.)

25 46. Both the PZL and the Lafayette Municipal Code prescribe the public notice that is required
26 before the City may issue a discretionary land use approval such as an exception to the Tree Protection

27 Ordinance. Government Code sections 65090 and 65091 direct that written "[n]otice of the hearing shall

28 be mailed or delivered at least 10 days prior to the hearing to all owners of real property . within 300

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT 16 -

1 feet of the real property that is the subject of the hearing." (Government Code section 65091(a)(1).)

2 Additionally, notice must also either be "[p]ublished pursuant to [Government Code] section 6061 in at

3 least one newspaper of general circulation within the local agency which is conducting the proceeding at

4 least ten days prior to the hearing" or "Ip]osted at least 10 days prior to the hearing in at least three

5 public places within the boundaries of the local agency, including one public place in the area directly

6 affected by the proceeding." (Id. at (a)(5).) Title Six of the Lafayette Municipal Code likewise requires

7 written 10-day notice by publication, posting and mailing to affected property owners before the City

8 may make land use decisions affecting them. (Lafayette Municipal Code § 6-211.)

9 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

10 47. Petitioners Michael Dawson and David Kosters, and many other members of petitioner Save

11 Lafayette Trees, reside in proximity to trees that would be removed under the Park District's Tree

12 Removal MOU challenged in this action. They own real property whose use, enjoyment and value

13 would be harmed by the tree removal allowed by the Tree Removal MOU. Additionally, thousands of

14 supporters of petitioner Save Lafayette Trees regularly use and enjoy regional parks and trail systems in

15 and near the City of Lafayette that would lose healthy, mature native trees under the Park District's Tree

16 Removal MOU. Many of petitioner's members, and other members of the public, reside within 300 feet

17 of the trees slated for removal pursuant to the Park District's Tree Removal MOU.

18 48. The Park District failed to provide any written notice, by mail, posting, or publication,
19 reasonably calculated to apprise the public, petitioners and their members of PG&E's proposed removal

20 of trees pursuant to the Tree Removal MOU prior to its approval. Instead, the Consent Calendar portion

21 of the Park District's online Board Agenda for its Board of Directors' meeting on March 21, 2017 •

22 described the MOU in full as follows: "Authorization to Accept Funding from PG&E's Community

23 Pipeline Safety Initiative for Environmental Protection and Maintenance at Briones Regional Park and
24 Lafayette-Moraga Regional Trail." Id.

25 49. Neither this Agenda item nor the accompanying description of the Board Resolution in

26 question mentioned or even implied that any trees would be removed. Rather than providing notice

27 reasonably calculated to alert petitioners and their members that trees would be removed, the Park
28 District's online Board Agenda for its March 21, 2017 Board Meeting was instead calculated to not

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 17 -

1 apprise the public and petitioners that PG&E would be allowed to remove hundreds of trees. Having

2 elected to keep the public in the dark about the actual purpose of this "Environmental Protection" MOU,

3 neither PG&E nor the Park District can be heard now to complain that their strategy worked exactly as

4 planned. The public was kept ignorant, with the result CEQA's 180-day limitation period did not
5 commence to run on March 21, 2017 when this MOU was purportedly approved.

6 50. The Park District conducted no environmental review under CEQA before approving the

7 Tree Removal MOU.

8 51. The Park District made no determination that the Tree Removal MOU is exempt from

9 CEQA before approving that MOU.

10 52. Petitioners did not learn of the Park District's approval of the Tree Removal MOU until

11 many weeks after its approval.

12 53. The Park District's Ordinance 38 provides no procedure whereby affected members of the

13 public may seek reconsideration of a Park District decision to approve a land use project such as the Tree
14 Removal MOU.

15 54. After learning of the Park District's approval of the Tree Removal MOU, petitioners

16 repeatedly asked - both in writing and through telephonic requests - that the Park District reconsider its
17 approval of that MOU, to no avail.

18 55. To date, the Park District has failed to take any action to reconsider its approval of the Tree

19 Removal MOU other than agreeing with petitioners to toll all applicable statutes of limitation for 60 days
20 by written agreement dated July 31, 2017.

21 56. The Park District failed to provide the public and petitioners with any adequate opportunity

22 to comment upon and object to the Park District's approval of the Tree Removal MOU and thereby

23 prevented the public and petitioners from objecting to the Park District's approval of the MOU on the

24 grounds it violated CEQA, the PZL, the City's General Plan and Tree Protection Ordinance, the Park

25 District's Ordinance 38 and the Due Process section of the California Constitution..

26 57. The Tree Removal MOU will foreseeably result in significant effects on the environment

27 and on petitioners.

28 58. The Park District is the lead agency for the Tree Removal MOU, as no other state or local

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 18 -

1 agency exercises authority over its approval. (Public Resources Code § 21067; Guidelines §15367.)

2 59. Prior to approving the Tree Removal MOU, the Park District did not determine the

3 significance of the environmental effects of the Tree Removal MOU pursuant to CEQA Guidelines

4 section 15064, nor prepare an initial study pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15063, a negative

5 declaration or a mitigated negative declaration pursuant to CEQA Guidelines sections 15070-15075, a

6 notice of exemption pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15062, or an EIR pursuant to CEQA

7 Guidelines sections 15080-15095, despite the fact that the Tree Removal MOU is a discretionary project

8 subject to CEQA that will have a demonstrably adverse impact on the environment.

9 60. After receiving notice of petitioners' similar lawsuit against the City, the Park District

10 belatedly prepared a post-hoc rationalization for its failure to consider CEQA prior to its approval of the

11 Tree Removal MOU by filing a misleading and materially defective Notice of Exemption three months

12 after approving the MOU, on June 29, 2017.

13 61. Contrary to its duty under CEQA Guidelines section 15062(a)(1) to provide "[a] brief
14 description of the project" -- the principal purpose of which is to remove 245 healthy trees - the Park
15 District's purported Notice of Exemption never discloses that the project would remove trees, let alone

16 hundreds of trees along popular public recreational trails. Nor did it provide "[t]he location of the
17 project" by "attaching a specific map" so the public would be alerted to the fact that many miles of high-

18 use recreational trails would be degraded and disfigured by the project's massive tree removal, contrary

19 to CEQA Guidelines section 15062(a)(2). Nor did the Park District's purported Notice of Exemption
20 provide a "brief statement of reasons to support the finding" that removal of 245 trees along heavily used

21 public recreational trails posed no potential for significant effect on the environment as required by

22 CEQA Guidelines section 15062(a)(4). To the contrary, this purported "notice" never even disclosed

23 that any trees would be removed. Because the Park District's purported Notice of Exemption was

24 "defective in a material manner," it did not commence the running of CEQA's statute of limitation.

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 19 -

1 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Writ of Mandate, Declaratory and Injunctive Relief to Set Aside Project Approval as Contrary to CEQA)
3 (Alleged by Petitioners Against All Defendants and Real Parties)
62. The paragraphs set forth above and below are realleged and incorporated herein by

5 reference.

6 63. Petitioners bring this First Cause of Action pursuant to Public Resources Code sections

7 21168 and/or 21168.5, on the grounds that the Park District failed to act in accordance with law, and

8 committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion, in that it considered and approved the Tree Removal MOU

9 without undertaking an analysis of its potential environmental impacts as required by CEQA.

10 64. The Park District is a "public agency" and a "local agency" within the meaning of CEQA.

11 (Public Resources Code §§ 21062, 21063; Guidelines §§ 15368, 15379.) CEQA requires public

12 agencies to conduct environmental review prior to approving any discretionary project that may have a

13 significant impact on the environment. (Public Resources Code §§ 21080(a), 21151; Guidelines §

14 15004(a).) The Park District's approval of the Tree Removal MOU project is a discretionary project.

15 (Guidelines § 15357.)

16 65. Under CEQA, the term "project" means the "whole of an action, which has a potential for
17 resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foresecable indirect

18 physical change in the environment." (Guidelines § 15378(a).) The term "project" refers to the "activity

19 which is being approved and which may be subject to several discretionary approvals by government

20 agencies" and not the governmental approvals themselves. (Id. § 15378(c).) The Tree Removal MOU is

21 subject to CEQA and the environmental analysis required under CEQA encompasses the "whole" of this

22 project.

23 66. "Approval" of a project, for purposes of CEQA, means a decision by the agency "which

24 commits the agency to a definite a course of action in regard to a project intended to be carried out by any

25 person." § (Id. § 15352(a).) The Park District's consideration and approval of the Tree Removal MOU
26 constitutes the "approval of a project" under CEQA.

27 67. If there is any possibility that a discretionary project being approved by a public agency may

28 cause a significant effect on the environment, directly or indirectly, the agency's review of the project

|FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 20 -

F must comply with CEQA. (Public Resources Code §§ 21065, 21080(a), 21151.) The Tree Removal

2 MOU will result in a number of "reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change[s] in the environment"

3 as well as direct physical changes in the environment.
68. On September 28, 2017, petitioners faxed, emailed and mailed notice to the Park District in

5 accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167.5, informing it of petitioners' intention to file this

6 action immediately. Concurrently with the filing of this Verified Petition and Complaint, petitioners
7 provided notice of the pendency of this proceeding to the California Attorney General as required by

8 Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388. Petitioners are also

9 serving the California Attorney General, the Park District, and PG&E with this Amended Petition as

10 shown in the accompanying Proof of Service.

11 69. The Tree Removal MOU poses a potentially significant impact on the environment, and

12 does not fall within any of the exemptions claimed by the Park District in its purported Notice of

13 Exemption. The Park District was therefore required to prepare an initial study to examine this project's

14 effects on the environment pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15063. It failed to do so. It also failed

15 to prepare either a negative declaration or a mitigated negative declaration pursuant to CEQA Guidelines

16 sections 15070-15075 or an environmental impact report pursuant to CEQA Guidelines sections 15080-

17 15095. Because it failed to perform these CEQA duties before approving the tree removal MOU, the

18 Park District violated CEQA.

19 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

20 (Writ of Mandate, Declaratory and Injunctive Relief to Set Aside Project Approval as Contrary to Planning and Zoning Law
21 and Park District Ordinance 38) (Alleged by Petitioners Against All Defendants and Real Parties)
22

23 70. The paragraphs set forth above and below are realleged and incorporated herein by

24 reference.

25 71. Government Code sections 65000, et seq. prescribe procedures and substantive standards

26 that general law cities such as the City of Lafayette must follow in adopting a comprehensive, long-term

27 general plan for the use and physical development of land within the City, and in developing goals,

28 policies and programs to implement that plan. Government Code section 65400 directs that the general

IFIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 21 -

1 plan shall serve "as a pattern and guide for the orderly physical growth and development and the

2 preservation and conservation of open space land of the county or city, and as a basis for the efficient

3 expenditure of [the city's or county's] funds relating to the subjects of the general plan ...." (Id.) The

4 general plan is, in short, a "constitution" for all further development with the City. (O'Loane v.

5 O'Rourke (1965) 231 Cal.App.2d 774, 782.)

6 72. Government Code section 65302 directs that the general plan "shall consist of a statement

7 of development policies and shall include a diagram or diagrams and text setting forth objectives,

8 principles, standards and plan proposals." (Id.) It must include elements for land use, circulation,

9 housing, conservation, open space, noise and additional elements as needed to regulate land use and

10 protect and preserve environmental resources.

11 73. Government Code section 65030.1 directs that it is state policy that "decisions involving the

12 future growth of the state, most of which are made and will continue to be made at the local level, should

13 be guided by an effective planning process, including the local general plan ...." (Id.)

14 74. Government Code section 65564 directs that "[e]very local open-space plan shall contain an

15 action program consisting of specific programs which the legislative body intends to pursue in
16 implementing its open-space plan." (Id.)

17 75. Government Code section 65566 directs that "[a]ny action by a county or city by which

18 open-space land or any interest therein is acquired or disposed of or its use restricted or regulated,

19 whether or not pursuant to this part, must be consistent with the local open-space plan." (Id.)

20 76. Pursuant to the Planning and Zoning Law and in accordance with its General Plan, the City

21 of Lafayette adopted its Tree Protection Ordinance to provide for the protection and preservation of the

22 City's healthy, mature trees. (Lafayette Municipal Code, Chapter 6-17, Section 6-1701 to 6-1713;

23 Lafayette General Plan, Open Space and Conservation Element, Policy OS-4.3 ("[p]reserve existing

24 woodlands") and Program OS-4.3.1 ("[e]xpand the City's tree-protection ordinance to include

25 protection for significant native trees and woodlands").)

26 77. Contrary to the requirements of the PZL, the Lafayette General Plan, and the City's Tree
27 Protection Ordinance, the Park District approved the Tree Removal MOU despite its conflicts with these
28 requirements and their applicability to the 31 trees on Park District land located within the City of

|FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 22 -

1 Lafayette.

2 78. The Park District proceeded in excess of its jurisdiction and abused its discretion when it

3 approved the Tree Removal MOU, and allowed removal of trees without compliance with the

4 substantive and procedural requirements of the PZL, Lafayette General Plan, the Tree Protection

5 Ordinance and Ordinance 38. The Park District's approval of the Tree Removal MOU is therefore
6 invalid and must be set aside.

7 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

8 (Writ of Mandate, Declaratory and Injunctive Relief to Set Aside

9 Park District's Approval of Tree Removal MOU in Violation of Petitioners' Due Process Rights)

10 (Alleged by Petitioners Against All Defendants and Real Parties)

11 79. The paragrapls set forth above and below are realleged and incorporated herein by

12 reference.

13 80. Petitioners and their members are constitutionally entitled to due process including public

14 notice of proposed Park District land use approvals that would harm their property and related
15 environmental interests.. (California Constitution, Article I, § 7.)

16 81. The right of petitioners and their members to due process encompasses a right to public

17 notice of the Park District's proposed adoption of the Tree Removal MOU and the right a to a fair hearing

18 or other equivalent opportunity in which petitioners and their members may present evidence and

19 argument in opposition to the Tree Removal MOU. (Horn v. County of Ventura, supra, 24 Cal.3d at
20 617-618.) Required notice must be "calculated to apprise directly affected persons of a pending decision

21 that effects their property interests." (Id.)

22 82. Denial of adequate public notice of an agency hearing for a decision affecting the property

23 interests of a person is reviewable and remediable under both Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 and

24 Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5. (Clark v. City of Hermosa Beach (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1152,
25 1177-1183 (section 1094.5(b)); Mednik v. State Dept. of Health Care Services (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th

26 631, 639 (section 1085).)

27 83. The Park District violated the Due Process rights of petitioners and their members because

28 it failed to provide notice reasonably calculated to apprise them and other directly affected persons that

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 23 -

1 hundreds of trees near their properties and along many miles of highly popular public recreational trails

2 would be removed, and their property interests would be thereby affected, as required by law and the

3 Due Process section of the California Constitution, before approving that MOU.

4 84. For each of these reasons, petitioners were denied their right to due process in violation of
5 Article I, section 7 of the California Constitution when the Park District purported to approve the Tree

6 Removal MOU without providing the public notice of its proposed action to petitioners as required by

7 law. Accordingly, the Park District's approval of the Tree Removal MOU is invalid and must be set

8 aside.

9 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

10 (Writ of Mandate, Declaratory and Injunctive Relief to Set Aside

11 Project Approval as Contrary to C.C.P. 8§ 1085 and 1094.5) (Alleged by Petitioners Against All Defendants and Real Parties)

12 85. The paragraphs set forth above and below are realleged and incorporated herein by

13 reference.

14 86. The Park District proceeded in excess of its authority and abused its discretion in approving

15 the Tree Removal MOU without compliance with CEQA, the PZL, the City's General Plan and
16 Municipal Code, the Park District's Ordinance 38 and the Due Process section of the California

17 Constitution. Said approval therefore violates Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5 in the

18 following respects, among others:

19 a. said approval was not preceded by adequate public notice reasonably calculated to

20 apprise the public and petitioners that the subject MOU would remove hundreds of healthy trees near

21 their properties and along popular public recreational trails;

22 b. said approval was not granted in accordance with the procedures required by law

23 including the procedures set forth in CEQA, the PZL, the Lafayette General Plan and Municipal Code,

24 the Park District's Ordinance 38 and the California Constitution;

25 C. said approval was not supported by, or was contrary to, the evidence available to

26 the Park District; and

27 d. said approval was not based on the findings required by law.

28 87. The Park District's actions in approving the Tree Removal MOU without first complying

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 24 -

1 with the procedures required by Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, CEQA, the PZL, the

2 City's General Plan and Municipal Code, the Park District's Ordinance 38 and the California

3 Constitution exceed the Park District's jurisdiction and constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

4 Accordingly, the Park District's approval of the Tree Removal MOU is contrary to law and invalid and

5 must be set aside.

6 PETITIONERS ARE ENTITLED TO RELIEF

7 88. The paragraphs set forth above are realleged and incorporated herein by reference.

8 89. Petitioners are beneficially interested in the Park District's approval of the Tree Removal
9 MOU, because the Park District's approval of this project poses environmental impacts that will harm

10 petitioners and their members and their real property.

11 90. Petitioners timely seek appropriate mandamus, declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent

12 the Park District from attempting to implement any part of the Tree Removal MOU before this action is

13 resolved on its merits.

14 91. An actual controversy exists between petitioners and the Park District. Petitioners contend

15 that the Park District has acted in violation of applicable law as alleged hereinabove, and must therefore

16 vacate and set aside its approval of the Tree Removal MOU. Petitioners are informed and believe, and

17 thereon allege, that the Park District disputes these contentions. A judicial resolution of this controversy

18 is therefore necessary and appropriate.

19 92. At all times mentioned herein, the Park District was able to conduct environmental review

20 and analysis of the Tree Removal MOU as required by CEQA, the Park District's Ordinance 38 and

21 other applicable law, and to provide the public notice thereof required by the law. Nonetheless, the Park

22 District has failed and continues to fail to perform its duty to conduct this required environmental review

23 and analysis under CEQA, the Park District's Ordinance 38 and other applicable law, and to provide the

24 public notice thereof required by law.

25 93. If the Park District is not ordered to set aside its approval of the Tree Removal MOU,
26 petitioners and the public will be irreparably harmed. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, and adequate
27 remedy in the ordinary course of law. Unless this Court issues its writ of mandate or injunctive relief
28 vacating the Park District's approval of the Tree Removal MOU, and requiring the Park District to

|FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 25 -

1 comply with CEQA, the PZL, the City's General Plan and Municipal Code, the Park District's

2 Ordinance 38 and the California Constitution, the Park District's approval challenged herein would

3 violate applicable law. No monetary damages or other legal remedy could adequately compensate

4 petitioners for the harm to essential environmental reviews, protected property interests and

5 environmental quality threatened by the Park District's approval of the Tree Removal MOU.

6 RELIEF REQUESTED

7 WHEREFORE, petitioners pray for judgment and further relief as follows:

8 1. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing the Bast Bay Regional Park District ("Park

9 District") to set aside and vacate its approval of the Tree Removal MOU;

10 2. For declaratory relief declaring the Tree Removal MOU to be unlawful;

11 3. For injunctive relief preventing the Park District from implementing the Tree Removal

12 MOU unless and until the Park District and PG&E have complied with CEQA, the PZL, the City's

13 General Plan and Municipal Code, the Park District's Ordinance 38 and the California Constitution;

14 6. For attorneys' fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5;

15 7. For costs incurred in this action; and

16 8. For such other equitable or legal relief as the Court may deem just and proper.
