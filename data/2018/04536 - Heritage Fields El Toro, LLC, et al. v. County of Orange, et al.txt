Gibson, Dunn :
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Petitioner HERITAGE FIELDS EL TORO, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company

2 (hereafter "Heritage Fields"), brings this action on its own behalf, on behalf of the general public, and
3 in the public interest, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and Public Resources Code

4 section 21168 or, in the alternative, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 and Public

5 Resources Code section 21168.5. Heritage Fields alleges as follows:

6 INTRODUCTION

7 1. In defiance of repeated pleas that the County of Orange (the "County") refrain from
8 taking actions that threaten the successful completion of the master planned Orange County Great
9 Park (the "Great Park"), and in clear violation of the California Environmental Quality Act, Public
10 Res. Code Sections 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"), on November 14, 2017, the Orange County Board of
11 Supervisors approved the EI Toro 100-Acre Development Plan (the "Lowe Development Plan" or

12 "Project"), certified the inadequate Final Program Environmental Impact Report No. 620 for the EI
13 Toro 100-Acre Parcel Development Plan (the "EIR"), adopted an inadequate Statement of Overriding
14 Considerations for the EIR, and authorized execution of a Master Ground Lease with Lowe

15 Enterprises Real Estate Group a ("Lowe"), a California corporation. These approvals are collectively
16 referred to in this Complaint as the "Project Approvals." The County filed the Notice of
17 Determination on November 14, 2017.

18 2. The 100 acres that the County proposes to lease to Lowe were conveyed by Heritage
19 Fields to the City of Irvine ("City"), and in turn by the City, at no cost, to the County for the land, as
20 part of the overall Great Park transaction in the early 2000's that allowed the former Marine Corps
21 facility at El Toro to be transformed into commercial and residential development and more than a
22 thousand acres of public parks. The 100 acres set aside for the County were intended to be utilized
23 for County-related uses, as public benefit, and have been so designated in the City approved plans
24 and CEQA documents prepared with respect to the Great Park. In contrast to this intended purpose,
25 the Project Approvals now allow Lowe, a private real estate developer, to build One Million
26 (1,000,000) square feet of new private office development, One Thousand Nine-Hundred Ninety-
27 Eight (1,998) private dwelling units, Two Hundred Thousand (200,000) square feet of private retail
28 uses, and Two Hundred Forty-Two (242) private hotel rooms, adjacent to the Great Park, within the

Gibson, Dunn & 2
Crutcher LL VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

jurisdictional boundaries of the City. In total disregard for established principles of California law,

2 the County determined that the Development Plan was exempt from the City's General Plan, the

3 County's General Plan, the City's Zoning Code, the County's Zoning Code, approval by any
4 planning commission, and all other public hearing and notice provisions of the City and County.
Accordingly, the Project was approved without any consideration by any planning commission or

6 without even so much as a single noticed public hearing for review by a City (or County) planning

7 commission.

8 3. In other words, the Lowe Development Plan stands alone, exempt from all standards
and procedures applicable to every other development in the State of California. In making this

10 erroneous determination, the County compounded the error by failing to analyze in the EIR the

11 significant land use incompatibilities created by allowing the Project's commercial and residential
12 development, in place of the originally approved public and institutional uses. Not only is the Project
13 inconsistent with the current zoning in the City of Irvine, it is also inconsistent with the requirements
14 of "Measure W" (a citizen's initiative approved by the voters of the County in 2002, which reserved
15 the subject property for open space and public/educational uses). None of these inconsistencies was

16 disclosed or analyzed in the EIR as required by CEQA.

17 4. Moreover, the Final EIR failed to respond to comments raised by Heritage Fields and

18 other concerned members of the public, failed to make a good-faith effort at disclosure as required by
19 CEQA, ignored applicable City and County parkland standards, improperly segmented environmental

20 review, improperly deferred mitigation measures, misrepresented the true provisions of Lowe's

21 Development Plan, and failed to recirculate the EIR as required by CEQA despite revealing new

22 significant traffic impacts and complete reversal of the EIR's analysis of greenhouse gas emissions

23 just ten days before the County Board of Supervisors approved the Project.
24 5. Beyond these myriad violations of CEQA, the unequivocally private uses approved by
25 the County violate the express language and clear intent of the 2003 City and County Pre-Annexation
26 Agreement (*Pre-Annexation Agreement"), which agreement reserved the subject property for
27 government uses, such as a Youth and Family Resource Center, an animal shelter, childcare facilities,

28 law enforcement training facilities, and an emergency shelter. The County has also violated the Pre-

Gibson, Dunn & 3
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

I it Annexation Agreement because it has approved the Project without a current, enforceable, binding

2 commitment obligating the County to pay its fair share of mitigation and infrastructure expenses, as

3 required by a provision of the agreement intended to benefit future users of the area such as Heritage

4 Fields, the landowner and master developer of the Great Park Neighborhoods.

5 6. The Project is in the City's Great Park area, which is carefully governed by multiple

6 agreements, including the City's Amended and Restated Development Agreement ("ARDA"), with,

7 inter alia, Heritage Fields. In the context of the ARDA, the City and Heritage Fields have allocated

8 responsibility for the funding and completion of the infrastructure and park improvements required to

9 bring the vision of the Orange County voters, to have a world-class public park, to fruition. The
10 ARDA balances many interests. Among other things it requires the City to construct a large-scale
11 public park in compliance with the Great Park Master Plan. The ARDA is premised on the

12 recognition that there is a finite amount of traffic capacity to accommodate future development, and a
13 finite number of infrastructure improvements to create that capacity. The available traffic capacity

14 must accommodate both the buildout of the Great Park, and the private development that was
15 approved as part of the Great Park planning process, in order to fund the dedication and contribution
16 of $200 million towards the construction of the Great Park. As memorialized in Exhibit L of the

17 ARDA, the County's 100 acres were designated for 300,000 square feet of "institutional"

18 development, and therefore expected to utilize only the traffic capacity needed to accommodate the

19 list of public/institutional uses provided for in the Pre-Annexation Agreement between the County

20 and the City. The County never disputed the substance of Exhibit L or the assumptions in the 2003

21 EIR prepared in connection with the Great Park. The amount of development associated with the
22 Project requires far more traffic capacity than was assumed in the 2003 EIR for the Great Park, or in

23 the ARDA. If the County improperly utilizes the trips needed for completion of the Great Park, the

24 City will not be able to fulfill its contractual commitment to Heritage Fields. By executing contracts

25 for the Lowe Development Plan and Ground Lease and insisting that the City rezone the County's

26 property for the dense private-use Project inconsistent with the Property's permitted uses and the
27 Overlay Plan included as Exhibit L in the ARDA, the County has committed acts of governance that

28

Gibson, Dunn & 4
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

intentionally interfered with the ARDA such that the City will be unable to construct the Great Park

2 as required by the ARDA, or meet its other obligations with respect to Heritage Fields.

3 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

7. This Court has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1094.5 of the Code of

Civil Procedure and section 21168 of the Public Resources Code.

8. This Court also has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1085 of the Code of

7 Civil Procedure, and section 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.

8 9. The Court also has jurisdiction over the validation action under section 860 et seq. of

the Code of Civil Procedure, and section 53511 of the Government Code.

10 10. Venue for this action properly lies in the Orange County Superior Court because the

11 property on which the Lowe Development Plan is located is in the County of Orange.

12 11. This petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167

13 and CEQA Guidelines section 15112.

14 PARTIES

15 12. Petitioner and Plaintiff HERITAGE FIELDS is the owner of land within the former

16 Marine Corps Air Station El Toro Property ("MCAS El Toro Property"), which is immediately

17 adjacent to the 100-Acre Parcel on which the Project would be constructed (the "Property).
18 Heritage Fields is the master developer of the Great Park Neighborhoods, within the boundaries of

19 the former MCAS El Toro Property. Heritage Fields purchased the MCAS EI Toro Property from the

20 United States Department of the Navy, and as part of the original entitlement process, Heritage Fields

21 conveyed more than 1,000 acres of former MCAS EI Toro Property to the City of Irvine and

22 contributed substantial financial resources toward the coordinated development of a great
23 metropolitan park, now known as the "Orange County Great Park" that provides cultural, athletic,

24 recreational, agricultural and aesthetic amenities to residents throughout Southern California.

25 Heritage Fields, which is an intended beneficiary of the Pre-Annexation Agreement, is directly and

26 adversely affected by development that does not contribute its fair share toward parkland and other

27 public improvements, and that would be incompatible with the significant investments Heritage
28 Fields has made to building the Orange County Great Park and the Great Park Neighborhoods.

13. On information and belief, Respondent and Defendant COUNTY OF ORANGE is a

2 political subdivision of the State of California, and is the lead agency under CEQA for the Project.
14. On information and belief, Real Party in Interest LOWE ENTERPRISES REAL
4 ESTATE GROUP ("Lowe"), a California corporation, would be the master developer of the Property
and would be the lessee under the Master Lease pursuant to which Lowe is responsible for "the

6 master planning, entitlement, and infrastructure development for the Property, entitling and

7 developing the Property for its highest, best and most economically viable use."

8 15. On information and belief, all persons interested in the matter of the November 14,
2017 approval of Resolution 17-138 by the County are also named as defendants herein.

10 16. The names and capacities, whether corporate, individual, or otherwise, of Defendants

11 Does 1 through 100, inclusive, are unknown to Heritage Fields at this time. Heritage Fields therefore

12 sues these Defendants, and each of them, by such fictitious names. Heritage Fields will seek leave of
13 court to amend this complaint to show the true names and capacities of the Doe Defendants when

14 they are fully ascertained. Heritage Fields is informed and believes that the Doe Defendants are

15 responsible and liable to Heritage Fields for the events, happenings and occurrences set forth herein.

16 STATEMENT OF FACTS

17 17. Following the decision by the Department of the Navy in 1993 to close the nearly
18 4,700-acre Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, the County of Orange sought to pursue a large-scale
19 commercial airport on the former MCAS El Toro property. Wishing instead to ensure that Orange
20 County would receive I regional park, the voters of Orange County decisively halted the County's
21 plan by approving Measure W on March 5, 2002. Measure W changed the allowed reuse of the

22 MCAS El Toro to a plan consisting exclusively of educational, recreational, open space, cultural and
23 other public uses as long as the land remained unincorporated. To guarantee that the Board of

24 Supervisors would honor those plans, Measure W enshrined those protections in the County General
25 Plan and required that any change of that designation while the land remained unincorporated must
26 be submitted to a vote of the people.

27 18. In 2003, the City and County entered into a Pre-Annexation Agreement, which was
28 intended to facilitate the City's annexation of the MCAS El Toro Property, and the ultimate transfer

Gibson, Dunn & 6
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

of the land to future owners and developers of the MCAS EI Toro Property (the role ultimately

2 secured by Heritage Fields after it purchased the MCAS El Toro Property). To achieve that end, the

3 Pre-Annexation Agreement provided that:

4 The County agrees to pay its fair share of costs as part of the funding
5 mechanism [City] was to set up to fund the costs of building "necessary infrastructure and related improvements." (Section 2.2.5.)
6 [City] will provide "through a Development Agreement between Irvine and
7 the purchaser(s) of El Toro property" (now Heritage Fields) for the conveyance of certain parcels to the County in the manner prescribed in the
8 Pre-Annexation Agreement. (Section 2.2.3.4.)
The City and County would "agree to cooperate and work together with the Navy to cause the expeditious transfer of the EI Toro property." (Section 4.)
10 19. In exchange for the County's agreement to allow the City to annex the entire MCAS

11 El Toro Property, the City agreed to zone the 100-Acre Property for the "exclusive use of the County

12 or its designees, lessees, or concessionaires ... to construct and operate permitted uses and facilities."

13 (Section 2.2.3.1.)

14 20. Section 2.2.4 of the Pre-Annexation Agreement further provides that "Irvine will zone
15 County's parcels and designate them in Irvine's General Plan, in accordance with County direction."
16 In addition, the "County shall retain exclusive land use control over [its parcels within the Former
17 MCAS El Toro Property], and shall be entitled to place any development upon said parcels that

18 County shall determine to be desirable for County's needs, as though said property remained
19 unincorporated, without the obligations for payment to Irvine of any permit fees or other

20 mitigation/impact fees, other than in Section 2.2.5, including but not limited to the following uses, all

21 of which Irvine agrees with: Animal shelter; Environmental health facilities; Automotive / equipment

22 repair facilities; childcare facilities; youth and family resource center; Law enforcement training

23 facilities; emergency shelter; Transitional shelter care facility; Children & Family Services Center;

24 Business offices; Warehouses; Storage facilities; Vehicle parking and storage facilities; Heavy

25 equipment and storage; Field operations and maintenance facility."

26 21. On information and belief, the City has already fulfilled this obligation by zoning the

27 100-Acre Property as an Institutional Use that allows every one of the permitted uses required by the

28 Pre-Annexation Agreement.

Gibson, Dunn & 7
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION. DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

22. Consistent with the process first established by the Pre-Annexation Agreement, the

2 City and the purchaser of the MCAS El Toro Property (Heritage Fields) entered into a Development
3 Agreement governing the future development of the MCAS El Toro Property on October 12, 2004.

4 The Development Agreement was subsequently amended and restated in December 2010 in the

5 ARDA. Both the original development agreement and the ARDA were adopted pursuant to Section

6 65864 et seq. of the California Government Code (the "Development Agreement Statute"), which

7 authorizes a local agency to vest a property owner's development rights on its property in accordance

8 with the land use regulations and zoning/land use designations applicable at the time the development

9 agreement was entered into. At the time the development agreement and the ARDA were entered

10 into, the zoning designation applicable to the 100-Acre Property was the Institutional Zoning

11 contemplated by the uses enumerated in the Pre-Annexation Agreement.

12 23. Section 7.9 of the ARDA further acknowledged the County's obligation set forth in
13 the Pre-Annexation Agreement to pay for its fair share of infrastructure improvements, required the
14 City to actively enforce these provisions of the Pre-Annexation Agreement, and recognized the fact
15 that nothing in the Development Agreement should be deemed as a "waiver by Heritage Fields of any
16 rights Heritage Fields" has against the County with respect to enforcing the Pre-Annexation
17 Agreement.

18 24. In 2006, the County acknowledged the limited uses to which the 100-Acre Property
19 may be put, writing to the Orange County Grand Jury that:

20 Irvine agreed to the County sharing in a certain percentage of the
21 property taxes as well as receipt of certain parcels of property, totaling approximately 240 acres to be used for certain County purposes such as
22 a Youth and Family Resource Center, an animal shelter, childcare facilities, law enforcement training facilities, and an emergency shelter.
23 25. Eight years after this admission and more than ten years after the Pre-Annexation

24 Agreement was enacted, on January 28, 2014, the County entered into a Disposition and

25 Development Agreement with Lowe to develop both the County's 100-Acre Parcel, and nearby

26 parcel of land also conveyed to the County pursuant to the Pre-Annexation Agreement (the other

27 parcel is commonly known as the "West Alton Parcel"). On information and belief, Lowe proceeded

28

Gibsan, Dunn & Crutcher LLP VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

to create a Development Plan (the "Lowe Development Plan") that would allow for the development

2 of private offices, private dwellings, private retail and private hotel uses on both those parcels.

3 26. A Notice of Preparation of a Draft Program EIR was released by the County and was

4 filed with the State Clearinghouse on November 7, 2014. The Draft EIR was released for the

5 minimum required review period on November 4, 2016. Twenty-six comment letters including one

6 by Heritage Fields-were submitted within the comment period raising myriad defects with the EIR,

7 including but not limited to a failure to (i) accurately identify the proper land use jurisdiction over the

8 100-Acre Parcel, (ii) adequately mitigate significant impacts to parks and recreational uses in
9 neighboring jurisdictions, (iii) accurately disclose inconsistencies with applicable land use and air

10 quality regulations, (iv) properly mitigate traffic impacts, (v) properly analyze, disclose and mitigate

11 air quality and greenhouse gas emission impacts, and (vi) properly mitigate against impacts to the

12 adjacent wildlife corridor.

13 27. On November 3, 2017 (six business days before the Board of Supervisors certified the

14 Final EIR and approved the Project), the County released a Final EIR consisting of 1,328 pages of
15 responses to comments and 14,681 pages of new attachments.

16 28. Buried in these documents was a brand-new disclosure that the recommended Project
17 would create new significant traffic impacts never before disclosed in the Draft EIR and a complete

18 reversal of its conclusions with respect to greenhouse gas emissions.
19 29. Omitted from these documents was any substantive County response to the objection
20 raised repeatedly by numerous commenters--including Heritage Fields--that the EIR's assumption

21 that the County, and not the City, has land use jurisdiction over the Project is incorrect as a matter of

22 law and that therefore the County had not proceeded in a manner according to law, in violation of

23 CEQA.

24 30. On November 14, 2017, after hearing objections to the Lowe Development Plan from
25 dozens of public speakers and receiving numerous additional comment letters reiterating previous

26 objections and identifying new failures to comply with CEQA arising from the Final EIR's responses
27 to comments, one member of the Board of Supervisors asked a representative of County Counsel
28 whether any case law supported the County EIR's assertion that the County-and not the City--held

Gibson, Dunn 8 Crutcher LI.P VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

land use authority over the 100-Acre Parcel. The County Counsel informed the Supervisors that no

2 case law supported the County EIR's position. The County Board of Supervisors then stopped asking

3 questions, certified the EIR, adopted the Statement of Overriding Considerations, and approved the

4 Lowe Development Plan.

5 31. A Notice of Determination was filed by the County on November 14, 2017.

6 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

7 32. Heritage Fields objected to the Project in the administrative proceedings, and fully

8 exhausted its administrative remedies, including by submitting at least three letters raising issues with
the adequacy of the EIR and objections to the legally flawed process.

10 33. Either Heritage Fields or other commenters in the CEQA administrative process raised

11 all factual and legal issues asserted under CEQA in this Petition. Heritage Fields has thus exhausted

12 all administrative remedies available to it, or such exhaustion is otherwise futile.

13 34. Heritage Fields has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by
14 providing the County with notice of its intention to commence the action. Proof of service of the
15 notice is attached as Exhibit 1. A copy of this Petition is being sent by registered mail to the Attorney
16 General of the State of California.

17 35. Heritage Fields elects to prepare the administrative record. A copy of that election is

18 attached as Exhibit 2.

19 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

20 (Violations of the California Environmental Quality Act Against Respondent and Real

21 Party in Interest)

22 36. Heritage Fields incorporates paragraphs I through 35 of this Petition and Complaint as
23 though fully set forth herein.

24 The EIR Fails to Accurately Describe the Land Use Jurisdiction Applicable to the

25 Project and Fails to Make a Good-Faith Effort to Disclose Conflicts with Applicable

26 General Plan and Zoning Ordinances

27 37. An accurate, stable and finite project description is indispensable to an informative

28 and legally sufficient EIR. CEQA Guidelines Section 15124(d) requires the project description to

Gibson, Dunn & 10
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

include a statement describing the intended uses of the EIR, including "a list of the agencies that are

2 expected to use the EIR in their decision making" and "a list of permits and other approvals required

3 to implement the project."

4 38. The EIR at issue in this action failed to accurately identify the "list of the agencies that

5 are expected to use the EIR in their decision making" and "a list of permits and other approvals

6 required to implement the project," and thus the Project Description is inadequate.

7 39. CEQA requires that a lead agency conduct an adequate environmental review prior to
8 approving a discretionary project. This duty includes an obligation to make a good-faith effort at full

9 disclosure to the public of all significant environmental effects that may occur as a result of the

10 Project.

11 40. The EIR fails to make a good-faith effort at fully disclosing the Project's "conflicts
12 with applicable land use plan[s], polic[ies] and regulation[s]", as required by Significance Threshold
13 4.9-1. The EIR's failure to accurately describe this impact renders both the EIR--and the Statement

14 of Overriding Considerations-inadequate and in violation of CEQA.

15 41. Any sufficient analysis of the Project's consistency with applicable land use controls

16 requires the EIR to identify which land use controls apply. The EIR took the unsupportable position
17 that the Project is exempt from any land use requirements, including but not limited to City and

18 County general plan and zoning requirements. (EIR, page 3-1.) All analysis in the EIR that flows

19 from this erroneous conclusion is necessarily flawed.

20 42. The EIR exacerbates the lack of analysis of land use incompatibilities by failing to

21 disclose the Project's fundamental inconsistency with Measure W. If, as the County asserts, the

22 language of the Pre-Annexation Agreement stating that the 100-Acre Parcel is to be treated "as

23 though it is unincorporated" is correct, Measure W (and all other provisions of the County General

24 Plan) must apply. And, as noted in the recitals to the Pre-Annexation Agreement, Measure W applied

25 open space and public use land use designations to the Property. The Lowe Development Plan

26 complies with none of these use restrictions and none of these development standards. The EIR

27 never discloses this fact.

28

Gibson, Dunn & 11
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

43.

2 Alternatively, if the Property is not subject to Measure W, the Property is subject to

3 City "TTOD" Zoning. The EIR did not fully or accurately identify the Project's inconsistency with

4 the TTOD Zoning, and thus failed to make the good-faith effort at disclosure required by CEQA.
44.

un Because the EIR sometimes claims that the Project is exempt from County General
Plan standards (although it contradicts itself by citing to those standards when it is convenient to do

6

7 so), the EIR purports to analyze the Project's consistency with City land use requirements. However,

8 is this analysis is incomplete and inaccurate. For example, Table 2 provided as part of Topical
Response 3.1.2 on page

9 3-4 of the Final EIR fails to disclose the fact that the Development Plan

10 allows substantial deviations from the requirements set forth in Table 2. The implication of this

11 omission is that the Development Plan standards are dramatically less restrictive than the surrounding

12 zoning and the impacts of those deviations are never disclosed. As a result of this failure, the

13 County's findings with respect to significant impacts to land use compatibility are not supported by
substantial evidence.

14 45.

15 The EIR also misleadingly and selectively quotes from the Pre-Annexation Agreement

16 in an apparent attempt to argue for the County's preferred position, rather than fairly and accurately

17 disclosing impacts to members of the public and to decision makers. For example, the EIR quotes the

18 section of the Pre-Annexation Agreement stating that the County "shall be entitled to place any
development upon

19 said parcels that County shall determine to be desirable for County's needs, as

20 though said property remained unincorporated, without the obligations for payment to Irvine of any

21 permit fees or other mitigation/impact fees." However, the EIR excludes the next clause of the

22 sentence, which qualifies the preceding phrase, and states that these uses include but are not limited

23 to the following, "all of which Irvine agrees with: Animal shelter; Environmental health facilities;

24 Automotive / equipment repair facilities; childcare facilities; youth and family resource center; Law

25 enforcement training facilities; emergency shelter; Transitional shelter care facility; Children &

26 Family Services Center; Business offices; Warehouses; Storage facilities; Vehicle parking and

27 storage facilities; Heavy equipment and storage; Field operations and maintenance facility."

28 (emphasis added.) In doing so, the EIR fails to accomplish its mandated requirements of full
disclosure.

Gibson, Dunn &
Crutcher LLP 12
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- The EIR Fails to Adequately Respond to Public Comments

2 46. CEQA demands that the lead

3 agency must provide written responses to comments

4 submitted during the EIR comment period, and address concerns "in detail, giving reasons why
specific comments and suggestions were not accepted." (CEQA Guidelines § 15088(c).)

5 47.

6 The EIR violated this requirement by, among other instances, failing to respond to

7 Heritage Fields' comment (identified in the Final Paragraph of Comment HFET-2) that "the EIR

8 should have acknowledged the City standards and assessed the Project's environmental impacts
against those standards."
The EIR Has Impermissibly Piecemealed Analysis

10 48.

11 CEQA Guidelines Section 15378 defines a project to mean the "whole of an action."
CEQA prohibits the segmenting of a project into smaller components to avoid the risk that

12

13 environmental impacts from each project segment will be "submerged," potentially leading to
cumulatively "disastrous consequences."

14 49.

15 The County impermissibly splits the 100-acre and the West Alton portions of the

16 Lowe Development Project into two separate EIRs, released just weeks apart despite the fact that

17 Lowe has the exclusive right to engage in a comprehensive development scheme for both the 100-

18 Acre El Toro Parcel and the West Alton Parcel pursuant to the same Disposition and Development
Agreement ("DDA") with the County.

19 50.

20 The two components not only share the same developer, they are both located on the

21 former MCAS EI Toro, utilize the same roadways, and require (or, in the words of the EIR, will

22 "request") similar amendments to the same City Planning Area 51 zoning regulations. They also

23 share the same architect/master planner and contain largely parallel Development Plans. Lowe's

24 development timeline (Exhibit F to the DDA) treats the development of the 100-Acre and Alton

25 parcels as a single component and even appears a to anticipate a single CEQA review process:

26 Lowe's Task is to conduct a Site Assessment for both the 100-Acre and
Alton Parcel concurrently;

27 Lowe's Task 2 is to create a (singular) "Master Plan/Specific Plan" for both the 100-Acre and Alton Parcel concurrently;
28

Gibson, Dunn &
Crutcher LLF 13
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Lowe's Task 3 is to evaluate infrastructure and financing for both the 100- Acre and Alton Parcel concurrently; 2
Lowe's Task 4 is to conduct research and technical studies for both the 100- 3 Acre and Alton Parcel concurrently;

4 Lowe's Task 5 is to comply with CEQA for both the 100-Acre and Alton Parcel concurrently; and

6 Lowe's Task 6 is 6 to gain entitlements for both the 100-Acre and Alton Parcel concurrently.

7 51. Given the integrated nature of the development plan for the two parcels, the EIR

8 should have analyzed both projects, and its failure to do so represents impermissible segmentation of

9 a unified project.

10 The EIR Improperly Defers Mitigation and Analysis to Subsequent Environmental

11 Reviews That May Never Occur

12 52. The EIR implicitly admits that the EIR fails to fully analyze the development that will

13 occur on the property as to several potentially significant impacts, including:

14 Aesthetics (pages 3-104 to 3-105 and page 3-133);
15 Traffic and access, particularly in view of equivalency provisions of the Development Plan allowing conversion of one type of use to another (pages 3- 16 171, 3-255);

17 Light and Glare (page 3-186 to 3-187);

18 Shade and Shadow (page 3-188);

19 Noise Impacts (page 3-195); and

20 Public Facilities / Services (page 3-201).

21 53. The EIR justifies its failure to fully analyze the effects of the Project on two legally

22 inadequate bases: First, the EIR states that it would be "speculative" to study those details and

23 improperly attempts to hide behind the document's label as a "Program" EIR, despite applicable

24 precedent demonstrating that the label of an environmental impact report as a "project" or "program"

25 document does not change the requirements of the analysis.

26 54. The EIR also misrepresents the true nature of the Lowe Development Plan by falsely

27 stating that all future development will be subject to project-specific discretionary CEQA review. In

28 truth, Section 3.5 of the Lowe Development Plan states that "[p]ermitted uses are permitted by right

Gibson, Dunn & 14
Crutcher LLI VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 and do not require any type of discretionary action." Permitted uses (according to the Lowe

2 Development Plan) includeamong dozens of other items-offices, hotels and residential uses.

3 Thus, the plain language of the Development Plan contradicts the assurances provided by the EIR

4 that the inadequate analysis in the EIR will be subsequently supplemented.

5 The EIR Fails to Adopt Adequate Mitigation Measures to Reduce Significant Traffic

6 Impacts

7 55. CEQA requires that mitigation measures be feasible, including with respect to legal

8 impediments.

56. In violation of this requirement, the EIR relies on transportation mitigation measures

10 that would violate current City law and the vested rights of Heritage Fields. Thus, the EIR's traffic

11 mitigation cannot be legally implemented and is therefore legally inadequate.

12 57. For example, Mitigation Measure TRAN-3 provides that the County (or its designee)

13 would conduct a "fee reallocation study" to determine : project's fair share contribution to be paid to

14 the North Irvine Transportation Management ("NITM") Program, and that the County would cause

15 its designee to pay for its share of mitigation fees toward the List of NITM Improvements. This

16 provision violates the terms of the City of Irvine NITM Ordinance and the rights of Heritage Fields

17 codified in the Amended and Restated Development Agreement entered into between the City and

18 Heritage Fields.

19 58. NITM does not currently have a process to allow developments other than those listed

20 in the ordinance to utilize NITM. NITM a functions as a closed universe intended to mitigate the

21 impacts of the scope of development approved within the NITM area prior to (or concurrent with) the

22 adoption of the NITM Program. Section 6-3-701 of the Irvine Municipal Code explicitly states that

23 the "NITM Program is not intended to fund deficiencies that may be caused by developments outside

24 of the Properties that are approved subsequent to the adoption of this chapter, subsequent regional

25 changes in traffic patterns, or subsequent circulation changes due to development outside of the

26 Properties." Thus, the fundamental premise of using the closed "NITM" system to mitigate
27 additional development is at odds with the purpose of NITM and the Irvine Municipal Code.

28

Gibson, Dunn & 15
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

59. Ignoring these legal restrictions, the EIR would purport to have the County negotiate

2 an agreement with the City to allow it to pay for the fair-share cost of those improvements. But, to

3 allow the Lowe Development Plan to be included in the NITM properties, the NITM ordinance

4 would need to be amended. Under the ARDA, both participants in NITM--Heritage Fields and The

5 Irvine Companywould have to consent to any such amendment, and neither entity has provided its

6 consent. Yet the EIR treats this legally impossible and yet to be negotiated agreement as adequate

7 mitigation.

8 60. This mitigation measure is wholly inadequate because it does not address what

9 happens if the County is unable to reach agreement with the City or Caltrans, and the EIR does not

10 specify the contents of the agreement. This leaves the adequacy and actual terms of the mitigation

11 obligation entirely uncertain.

12 61. The requirement that the County require a future traffic study to determine fair-share

13 fee impacts is also inadequate given that Section 3.5 of the Lowe Development Plan allows permitted

14 uses to be built by right without "any additional discretionary review." So, the County has no actual
15 ability to require the developer to determine and then pay its fair share of traffic improvements, or to

16 require that the mitigation be in place before the development is constructed, rendering this
17 mitigation simultaneously illusory and misleading.

18 The EIR Must Be Recirculated Due to Significant New Information Added to the EIR

19 62. CEQA Guidelines Section 15088.5 requires an environmental impact report to be

20 recirculated when "significant new information is added to the EIR" after it is released for public

21 comment but before it is certified. The Guideline makes clear that information can include

22 "additional data or other information," and provides that this information is significant when "the EIR

23 is changed in a way that deprives the public of a meaningful opportunity to comment upon a

24 substantial adverse environmental effect of the project or a feasible way to mitigate or avoid such an
25 effect that the project proponents have declined to implement."

26 63. These changes specifically include, among other examples, situations where there is a
27 substantial increase in the severity of an environmental impact. Where an EIR reveals a new

28 potentially significant impact, recirculation is required. The Final EIR revealed, without sufficient

Gibson, Dunn & 16
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

I explanation, that the Project will cause significant traffic impacts at new intersections and roadway

2 segments not previously disclosed by the Draft EIR. The increase in severity to environmental

3 impacts includes impacts to both freeway ramps and surface street segments.

4 64. The Final EIR also reversed the conclusion of the Draft EIR with respect to whether

5 the Project would cause a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions. The Draft EIR had

6 concluded that there would be significant and unavoidable impacts, but the Final EIR reversed this

7 conclusion. The Final EIR fails to fully explain this reversal of position, thus depriving members of

8 the public with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on this significant change.
9 65. Although the sudden change and brand-new analysis is not fully explained by the EIR,

10 it appears that this sudden change is based (at least in part) on the addition of Mitigation Measures
11 GHG-5 and GHG-6, which require the use of electric lawnmowers and leaf blowers, and require

12 additional analysis as part of subsequent development reviews. As noted above, given the plain

13 language of Development Plan Section 3.5, which states that "permitted uses are permitted by right

14 and do not require any type of discretionary action," this mitigation measure may be entirely
15 unenforceable, and thus cannot be relied upon by the EIR to support its conclusion that the
16 greenhouse gas impacts have been mitigated to a level of less than significance.

17 66. The EIR's sudden reversal of its analysis requires recirculation so that the public and

18 decision makers will not be deprived of a meaningful opportunity to review and comment on the EIR.

19 The EIR Inaccurately Analyzes the Project's Provision of Parkland and Consistency

20 with Both City and County Park Standards

21 67. The EIR is required to evaluate significant impacts to existing park facilities that will

22 be caused by, for example, increased use of existing park facilities due to an insufficient supply of
23 parks provided by a new development. The EIR acknowledges this standard measure of evaluating

24 significant impacts by stating that the County's park standards set forth in its zoning code and other

25 land use regulations "ha[ve] been the basis to satisfy recreation impacts and evaluate potential CEQA

26 if impacts for most, if not all, of the communities in South Orange County."

27 68. The EIR fails to accurately or consistently evaluate the Project's provision of parkland
28 under this standard. First, Topical Response 3.1.9 (Parks) makes internally contradictory

Gibson, Dunn é 17
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

I interpretations of CEQA thresholds and obfuscates which standard the EIR is using to measure

2 impacts: just seven lines before it cites to the County zoning standards as the measure of determining

3 a significant impact under CEQA, the Response states (at page 3-35) that "neither the City's nor the

4 County's typical parkland standards apply to the proposed Project."

5 69. The Project is plainly inconsistent with the City's park standards. For instance, under

6 the City of Irvine Park Standards Manual, parkland located within a setback is not eligible for park

7 credit, but approximately half of the parkland that the EIR takes credit for is within the required

8 latitudinal setback.

9 70. Contradicting its earlier statement regarding the applicable parkland standard, the EIR

10 goes on to claim that the Project's provision of 9.9 acres of park land meets the County's park code

11 requirements, and thus there cannot be a significant impact as to parks and recreation.

12 71. Exacerbating the unclear and inconsistent analysis, the EIR misrepresents the Project's

13 compliance with those standards.

14 72. The County's General Plan Recreation Element indicates that the 2.5-acre park

15 requirement applies to "usable local park land (i.e., park land that is relatively level, served by

16 utilities, for multi-purpose playfields, court sports, etc.) for each prospective 1,000 residents." The
17 park criteria is set out in even greater detail in Appendix VII-3 of the County General Plan.

18 However, approximately 74% (7.3 acres) of the "parks" provided by the Project will be in the form of

19 what the EIR terms a "linear park." This so-called "linear park" fails to satisfy the definition of a

20 usable park in the County General Plan because it will consist only of an approximately 50-foot wide

21 landscaped trail and associated "exercise" amenities, rather than the "usable" "multi-purpose" parks

22 called for by the County General Plan. Once the 7.3 acres of landscaped trail are excluded from the

23 calculation, the Project would only provide approximately 3.4 acres of park land, a deficit of 66%

24 compared to the County park standard and a deficit of nearly 83% compared to the (proper) City park

25 standard.

26 73. These facts undermine the County's incorrect and conclusory assertion that the Project

27 complies with park standards. Thus, the EIR's assertion that the Project will cause no significant

28

Gibson, Dunn & 18
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

I impact to existing Park Facilities because it complies with County park standards is misleading and

2 not supported by substantial evidence in the record.

3 The Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations Are Unsupported by

4 Substantial Evidence

5 74. CEQA requires that a project with significant adverse impacts be approved only if the

6 lead agency makes findings supported by substantial evidence-that the project's benefits will

7 outweigh its adverse impacts and that there are not feasible mitigation measures or less damaging

8 alternatives available.

9 75. Because the EIR fails to accurately identify the Project's significant impacts to

10 Recreational Facilities and Parks, Traffic, Land Use Consistency and Greenhouse Gas Emissions, the

11 County never adopted findings to justify the Project's impacts in these areas. Thus, the Statement of

12 Overriding Considerations fails to meet CEQA requirements.

13 76. For all of the reasons set forth above, the Court should decertify the EIR and enjoin

14 the County and Lowe from taking any further action with respect to the Project, until a timely writ of

15 mandate is returned to this Court in compliance with CEQA, and the other applicable land use

16 regulations violated by Respondent's and Real Party's actions.

17 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

18 (Petition for Writ of Traditional Mandamus Under Code of Civil Procedure

19 Section 1085 or Alternatively Under Section 1094.5 Against Respondent)

20 77. Heritage Fields incorporates paragraphs 1 through 76 of this Complaint as though

21 fully set forth herein.

22 78. Heritage Fields seeks a writ of traditional mandamus pursuant to Code of Civil

23 Procedure Section 1085, or alternatively an administrative mandamus pursuant to Section 1094.5.

24 The County's approval of the Development Plan is contrary to law and is a prejudicial abuse of

25 discretion.

26 79. Review is appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure Section 1085 or Section 1094.5

27 because the County has failed to act in the manner required by law, committed an abuse of discretion,

28 and thus the repeal of the Lowe Development Plan is specifically required by the law.

Gibsan, Dunn 19
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

80. Heritage Fields has exhausted its administrative remedies through its participation in

2 the public processes preceding the approval.

3 81. Heritage Fields has no plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of

4 law to challenge the County's actions.

5 82. As a result, Heritage Fields is entitled to, and requests that this Court issue, a

6 peremptory writ of mandate compelling the County to repeal its approval of the Lowe Development

7 Plan.

8 The City-and Only the City--Has the Authority to Approve a Private Development
Project Within Its Jurisdictional Boundaries.

10 83. The County asserts that the City's zoning and land use jurisdiction is inapplicable to is

11 the Project due to California Government Code Sections 53090-53091, which the Draft EIR

12 incorrectly says "exempts [cities and counties] from zoning regulations when one entity owns

13 territory within the jurisdiction of another entity." However, the County fails to note that the

14 exemption from intergovernmental immunity cited by the County applies only to actions taken in a

15 governmental capacity; for actions which involve private or commercial projects, the jurisdiction in

16 which the property is located retains land use control. Thus, a state or local agency may not "extend

17 its immunity to private entrepreneurs who are involved in the local commercial market where their

18 competitors are subject to local regulation." (Board of Trustees v. City of Los Angeles (1975) 49

19 Cal.App.3d 45, 50.) Following Board of Trustees, the California Attorney General reconsidered an

20 earlier opinion (that it coincidentally had issued to the County of Orange) originally indicating a

21 relatively broad degreè of immunity when one jurisdiction owned land within the boundaries of

22 another jurisdiction. Instead, the Attorney General opined that the proper view of Government Code

23 Sections 53090-91 is that these statutes do not extend immunity to "private parties with respect to

24 their own private pursuits merely because the state" (or by parity of reasoning, the County) "happens

25 to be their landlord." 68 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 114, 121. Accordingly, the Project is subject to the land

26 use jurisdiction of the City--not the County-and the County's approval of the Development Plan
27 was taken without legal authority.

28

Gibsan, Dunn & 20
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

I 84. Here, the Project is being proposed by Lowe pursuant to a development and

2 disposition agreement ("DDA") in which Lowe will be the "applicant" and "face" of the Project, and

3 is obligated to secure entitlements from relevant public agencies, minimize risks to the County, and

4 maximize potential for an extremely favorable financial return for the County.

5 85. Lowe's lead role as developer of the Project is demonstrated by the fact that the

6 Development Plan appended to the Draft EIR was prepared for Lowe and the County (and, indeed,

7 has Lowe's logo on the front cover).

8 86. The County's Ground Lease with Lowe is for a term of 99 years, a term which
connotes long-term private use and ownership.

10 87. The Master Lease makes plain the fact that the County is not a partner nor in a joint

11 venture with Lowe. This is Lowe's private development project and it is therefore subject to full City

12 regulatory and land use authority, even though the County is the landlord. Section 24 of the Master

13 Lease makes clear that "it is expressly understood and agreed that [the] County does not in any way

14 or for any purpose become a partner of or joint venturer with [Lowe] in the conduct of [Lowe's]

15 business or otherwise." Indeed, Section 12.5 of the Master Lease would allow Lowe to make

16 recommendations for the sale of all or a portion of the property to third parties in furtherance of
17 Lowe's obligation to undertake "the master planning, entitlement, and infrastructure development for

18 the Property, entitling and developing the Property for its highest, best and most economically viable

19 use."

20 88. In other words, the Lowe Development Plan is an approval for an unequivocally

21 private development project undertaken by Lowe on a property located within the City. The County,

22 although it owns the Property, has no immunity from City jurisdiction for private projects and
23 therefore lacks the jurisdiction to authorize this development, and the City has not approved the

24 development.

25 89. Even if the County were to possess jurisdiction to approve a private development

26 project within the City of Irvine (which it does not), the Project fails to comply with the County's
27 General Plan.

28

Gibson, Dunn & 21
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

90. It would be a complete violation of state planning laws to have project that need not

2 conform to any General Plan. (E.g., East Sacramento Partnership for a Livable City v. City of

3 Sacramento (2016) 5 Cal.App.5th 281 ["local land use and development decisions must be consistent

4 with the applicable general plan"]; Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors, 52 Cal.3d 553,
570 (1990) [*the propriety of virtually any local decision affecting land use and development

6 depends upon consistency with the applicable general plan and its elements™] (quoting Resource

7 Defense Fund v. County of Santa Cruz (1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 800, 806.)

8 91. Moreover, even accepting the County's demonstrably incorrect position that the

9 private Lowe Development Plan is a "public project," County development and infrastructure

10 improvements still must be consistent with adopted General Plans. (See, e.g., Friends of "B" Street

11 V. City of Hayward (1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 988, 998 [citing Government Code section 65302's

12 requirement that a local agency must comply with specified mandatory elements of an adopted

13 general plan and noting that the "Legislature did not limit this policy to decisions regarding proposed

14 private developments; it encompasses all decisions involving the future growth of the state, which

15 necessarily includes decisions by a city to proceed with public works projects. All such decisions are

16 to be guided by an effective planning process that includes the local general plan"].)
17 92. Further, the County failed to submit the Lowe Development Plan for a review by and

18 recommendation from the County's Planning Commission, even though this procedural requirement

19 is imposed on both public and private projects. Section 7-9-5(a) of the Orange County Code vests the

20 County Planning Commission with the power to "recommend to the officers of the County adoption

21 of plans and regulations for the future growth, development and beautification of the County in

22 respect to public and private development." (Emphasis added.)

23 93. The Board of Supervisors' adoption of the Development Plan without any noticed

24 hearing or review by the Planning Commission violates Section 65453 of the California Government

25 Code, which requires specific plans (the closest analogy to the Development Plan) to be subject to

26 review by the Planning Commission. No such review occurred for the Project.

27 94. Moreover, each of the Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors (the
28 legislative body for the County) must hold at least one public hearing for which public notice is given is

Gibson, Dunn : 22
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 through publishing in a newspaper of general circulation not less than ten days prior to the hearing.

2 (See Sections 65353-54 of the Government Code.) On information and belief, the County held no

3 public hearings and provided no notice in the form required by the Government Code.

4 95. Similarly, even if the County were to claim that the Lowe Development Plan

5 constitutes a zoning enactment other than a specific plan, Section 65853 et seq. requires the Planning

6 Commission to review other proposed land use ordinances at a noticed public hearing. Thus,

7 regardless of whether the County characterizes the "Lowe Development Plan" as a specific plan or

8 other zoning enactment, the County failed to proceed in the manner required by law.
a 96. Beyond these procedural defects, the Lowe Development Plan violates the

10 foundational requirement that all zoning enactments and development projects be compatible with the

11 objectives, policies, general land uses, and programs specified a in a General Plan. (Cal. Gov. Code con

12 65860(a)(ii).) As emphasized by the California Supreme Court, a zoning ordinance that is

13 inconsistent with the general plan is void ab initio. (Lesher Communications, Inc. v. City of Walnut

14 Creek (1989) 262 Cal.Rptr. 337.)

15 97. For example, the Lowe Development Plan is inconsistent with the provisions of

16 Measure W, a voter initiative approved in 2002 that enacted County General Plan amendments that

17 changed "the allowed reuse of MCAS El Toro to a non-aviation plan, consisting of educational,

18 recreational, open space cultural and other public uses" for so long as the area remained

19 unincorporated. In contrast, Heritage Fields' developments-subject only to the City General Plan-

20 are fully consistent with that plan.

21 98. These designations could not be modified by an action of the Board of Supervisors

22 because Section 9 of Measure W provides that "[t]he Initiative may be amended only by a vote of the

23 people at a regular election held in accordance with the requirements of the California Elections

24 Code." And, as admitted in the Pre-Annexation Agreement, Measure W applied open space

25 designations to the Property. The one land use designation other than an "open space" designation

26 (which still does not allow the current Lowe proposal) was an "Education/Park Compatible"

27 designation, which called for long-term uses focused on educational facilities and related research

28 and development uses. That designation provided for 80% of the area to remain as open space, a

23 Gibson, Dunn &
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 maximum Floor to Area Ratio of 0.4, and a maximum of 45 employees per acre. The Lowe

2 Development Plan violates every one of these standards.

3 99. In short, the County's approval of the Lowe Development Plan violates Measure W by

4 enacting a land use plan wholly inconsistent with the General Plan provisions adopted by voters,

5 despite the requirement that the land use plan enacted by Measure W could only be amended by a

6 vote of the people for so long as the land remains "unincorporated."

7 100. The Lowe Development Plan is further inconsistent with the numeric, objective

8 standards for the provision of park land contained in the County's General Plan (see paragraph 72
9 above).

10 101. In addition to the fact that the Lowe Development Plan was never approved by the

11 City, it violates numerous City standards, including the existing City General Plan designation of the

12 site for Institutional Uses.

13 102. The Lowe Development Plan thus followed none of the (even potentially) applicable

14 rules:

15 it was not adopted by the City (which is the only jurisdiction with land use
16 authority over this private development project);

17 it was not adopted following the required County procedures for review of private development projects;
18 it violates numerous substantive provisions of the County General Plan
19 applicable to both public and private developments;

20 103. Thus, Heritage Fields is entitled to, and requests that this Court issue, a peremptory
21 writ of mandate compelling the County to repeal its approval of the Lowe Development Plan.

22 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

23 (Intentional Interference with Contractual Relations Against Defendant County)
24 104. Heritage Fields incorporates paragraphs 1 through 103 of this Complaint as though
25 fully set forth herein.

26 105. On or about December 27, 2010, Plaintiff Heritage Fields executed the ARDA with
27 the City and the Irvine Redevelopment Agency ("RDA"). The ARDA was recorded on the same day.

28

Gibson, Dunn & 24
Crutcher LLF VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 The ARDA is a valid and enforceable contract that remains in effect between Heritage Fields, the

2 City, and the Successor Agency to the RDA.

3 106. The County is not and has never been a party to the ARDA; however, the ARDA is an

4 existing encumbrance on the County property that was recorded against title as part of the original

5 Great Park transaction.

6 107. Defendant County had knowledge of the ARDA at the time that it was entered into,

7 because it was adopted as part of a public process and subsequently recorded. The County also had

8 knowledge of the ARDA throughout the CEQA environmental review process for the Lowe

9 Development Plan, because the EIR for the Plan references the ARDA throughout its analysis.

10 Further, the County had knowledge of the ARDA and the fact that the Lowe Development Plan

L1 violated the ARDA no later than November 13, 2017, when the City informed the County of its

12 violation by a letter of that date. In the letter, the City communicated that the proposed project

13 "violates binding agreements with the City, such as ... the Amended and Restated Development

14 Agreement" and, regarding traffic, that the ARDA contemplated that the County property would

15 consist of approximately 300,000 square feet of institutional uses, and therefore the Project "is not

16 consistent with ARDA and it far exceeds the overall ADT Budget for Planning Area 51.1 Exhibit L

17 of the ARDA contains the Overlay Plan for the Heritage Fields development and expressly provides

18 that the County property would be developed with "institutional" uses.

19 108. By entering into contracts for the Lowe Development Plan and Master Ground Lease,

20 the County committed acts of governance intentionally designed to induce a breach or disruption of

21 the ARDA. Defendant County knew or were at minimum substantially certain that such breach or

22 disruption was a necessary consequence of its actions.

23 109. As a result of Defendant County's above-described actions, there has been a breach or

24 disruption of the ARDA. Section 3.9.4 of the ARDA requires the City to construct a park on the

25 Great Park Property substantially in compliance with the Great Park Master Plan. The construction

26 of such a park requires a certain amount of allocated traffic capacity. With the County's contracting

27 to pursue the Lowe Development Plan--an unanticipated and unlawful dense private development

28 which uses substantially more trips than assumed under the ARDA-in the Great Park area, the

Gibson, Dunn & 25
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

County proposes to utilize trips reserved for other ARDA uses, such as the City's construction of the

2 large-scale park pursuant to Section 3.9.4. The County has not made adequate arrangements to

3 ensure that the Project will in fact implement all necessary traffic mitigation, and there will be

4 reduced traffic capacity to accommodate future traffic from as yet to be implemented uses in the
Great Park. As a result of the reduction in available trips, the City will be unable to construct a park

6 on the Great Park Property substantially in compliance with the Great Park Master Plan, in breach of

7 the ARDA.

8 110. But for Defendant County's actions regarding the Lowe Development Plan, the

9 ARDA would have been performed by the City and Heritage Fields.

10 111. Heritage Fields has been damaged due to Defendant County's interference with the

11 ARDA, because Heritage Fields has developed and is developing properties in the Great Park area in

12 reliance on the City's promise to construct a park on the Great Park Property substantially in
13 compliance with the Great Park Master Plan-a feature which had enhanced the value of its

14 properties. Heritage Fields has invested hundreds millions of dollars to obtain the property subject to
15 the ARDA and to entitle that property for specific uses articulated in the ARDA, and previously

16 approved by the City of Irvine. This includes completion of the Great Park and planned residential
17 and commercial development. Due to the County's intentional interference with Heritage Fields'

18 contract with the City (namely the ARDA), the City is prevented from constructing the park as

19 promised, and Plaintiff will be precluded from maximizing the full value of its investments. The

20 County was aware that damage will be caused to Plaintiff as a result of its actions, but chose to act in

21 total disregard of Heritage Fields' rights under the ARDA-thereby damaging Plaintiff in an amount

22 to be established at trial. The County's actions were made with malice and intent to harm, were
23 grossly reckless and were done without any regard whatsoever for the rights of Heritage Fields, and
24 the promises enjoyed by Plaintiff under the terms of its contracts with the City.

25 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

26 (Breach of Contract Against Defendant County)

27 112. Heritage Fields incorporates paragraphs through 111 of this Complaint as though

28 fully set forth herein.

Gibson, Dunn & 26
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

113. The Pre-Annexation Agreement between the County and the City is a valid and

2 enforceable contract that is currently still in effect.
W 114. Heritage Fields is an intended third-party beneficiary under the Pre-Annexation
Agreement. When the City and County executed the Pre-Annexation Agreement, they intended for it
to benefit, in part, the future purchaser of the El Toro property and a future "Base user," which
wO ultimately became Heritage Fields. At minimum, the City intended future Base users, such as

7 Heritage Fields, to benefit from the County's promise to "pay its fair share of costs" for infrastructure

8 improvements directly related to servicing the County's properties to be received under the Pre-
Annexation Agreement. In Section 2.2.5, the contract expressly provides that "the City seeks to

10 create a funding mechanism whereby all Base users pay their fair share of the costs of developing the

11 necessary infrastructure and related improvements," then obligates the County to pay its fair share.

12 This provision was intended to benefit future "Base users," such as Heritage Fields, so that certain

13 users were not made to pay a disproportionate share of infrastructure costs or the County's share of

14 infrastructure costs.

15 115. Thus, the intent to benefit Heritage Fields appears from the terms of the Pre-

16 Annexation Agreement. In addition to the benefit intended to benefit Base users in Section 2.2.5, the

17 City and County intended other benefits for future purchasers of the EI Toro property, including (a)

18 the City's and County's efforts to facilitate "expeditious transfer of the MCAS El Toro property"

19 (Section 4), and (b) the Pre-Annexation Agreement's requirement that a Development Agreement be

20 established to govern the manner in which the parcels would be conveyed by the purchaser to the
21 County (Section 2.2.3.4). Heritage Fields ultimately became the purchaser of the lands within MCAS

22 El Toro, and thus fits squarely within the class of parties intended to be benefited by the Pre-

23 Annexation Agreement.

24 116. The City's intent to benefit Heritage Fields by certain provisions of the Pre-

25 Annexation Agreement was later evidenced by the terms of the development agreement that the City

26 executed with Heritage Fields, the ARDA. Section 7.9 of the ARDA quotes Section 2.2.5 of the Pre-
27 Annexation Agreement (regarding the County's promise to pay its fair share of infrastructure costs,

28 for the benefit of future Base users) in full and the City covenants to request the County to honor this

Gibson, Dunni 27
Crutcher LLI VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

obligation, and covenants to actively pursue enforcement of this provision, again for the benefit of

2 Heritage Fields as a Base user. In ARDA Section 7.9, the City also expressly acknowledged Heritage
3 Fields' existing ability to enforce its third-party rights under the Pre-Annexation Agreement:
* "[NJothing contained herein shall be deemed a waiver by Heritage Fields of any rights Heritage
Fields may have as against the County with respect to the County Agreement [Pre-Annexation
e Agreement]."

7 117. On information and belief, the City has fully performed all conditions, covenants and

8 obligations required on its part to be performed in accordance with the terms of the Pre-Annexation
9 Agreement.

10 118. Under the Pre-Annexation Agreement, the County contractually committed to request

11 City zoning in accordance with government uses, such as the fifteen government uses enumerated in

12 Section 2.2.4 of the Pre-Annexation Agreement. In the alternative, pursuant to the requirement that

13 the land be treated as though it is "unincorporated," the County Board of Supervisors was obligated

14 to follow the land use plan enacted by Measure W, requiring its "unincorporated" land to be

15 maintained in accordance with the Open Space or Educational land use designations imposed on the

16 property by Measure W.
17 119. The County has breached the Pre-Annexation Agreement by:

18 failing to comply with this obligation to maintain uses in accordance with Measure W; 19
approving a Development Plan that will introduce uses not authorized by 20 the Pre-Annexation Agreement;
21 refusing to recognize the City's land use jurisdiction and review process;
22 setting up a mechanism by which Lowe may receive building permits without paying its fair share of transportation improvements (thus 23 increasing the burden on Heritage Fields); and
24 creating impacts on the Orange County Great Park and other recreation facilities not contemplated by the Pre-Annexation Agreement. 25

26 120. Heritage Fields has been and will be damaged by these breaches, because (among

27 other things) the Lowe Development Plan does not adequately provide for infrastructure costs (a

28 potential harm that Section 7.9 of the ARDA recognized would give rise to a right by Heritage Fields

28 Gibson, Dunn :
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

to take action against the County); creates adverse impacts to the future development and vibrancy of

2 the Orange County Great Park-a public good and an essential foundation of Heritage Fields' past

3 and ongoing investment in its Great Park Neighborhoods development; and interferes with Heritage

4 Fields' vested right to be able to develop the Property in accordance with the land use assumptions

5 codified by the land use regulations existing at the time the ARDA was entered into.

6 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

7 (Reverse Validation Action, Writ and Declaratory and Injunctive Relief Under

8 Mandamus Gov. Code $ 53511, Code Civ. Proc. §§ 863, 1060 - Invalidating Contracts
and Agreements Against Respondent)

10 121. Heritage Fields incorporates paragraphs 1 through 120 of this Complaint as though

11 fully set forth herein.

12 122. Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. Section 863 and Gov. Code Section 53511, Heritage

13 Fields is an interested party that seeks to invalidate the Project Approvals, including but not limited to

14 certain authorizations, actions, determinations, findings, and approvals for the reasons as set forth in
15 this Petition and Complaint.

16 123. As required by the California Code of Civil Procedure, this reverse-validation action

17 has been filed within sixty (60) days of the Project Approvals on November 14, 2017, and is therefore

18 timely.

19 124. On December 13, 2017, Laguna Greenbelt, Inc., Orange County Residents for

20 Sustainable Development, Marbella De Dios, and Farrah Kahn filed a Verified Petition for Writ of

21 Mandate, Complaint for Invalidation, Injunctive and Declaratory Relief in Orange County Superior

22 Court against the County of Orange and related entities and Lowe Enterprises Real Estate Group

23 challenging the Project Approvals at issue in this Petition and Complaint (Laguna Greenbelt, Inc. v.

24 County of Orange, Case No. 30-2017-00961195-CU-WM-CXC). This case is related to the Laguna

25 Greenbelt, Inc. V. County of Orange case, by court order dated December 28, 2017.

26 125. Jurisdiction of all interested parties to a reverse-validation action related to the Project

27 Approvals is being established by publication of summons in the Orange County Reporter, a

28 newspaper in general circulation in Orange County, by Petitioners in Laguna Greenbelt, Inc. v.

Gibson, Dunn & 29
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 County of Orange directed to the County of Orange, Lowe Enterprises Real Estate Group, and all

2 persons interested in the matter of the November 14, 2017 approval of Resolution 17-138 by the

3 County of Orange related to the approval of plans, master ground lease, authority to execute, and

4 documents necessary to build the El Toro 100-acre development on January 5, 2018 (with subsequent

5 publications scheduled for January 12 and 19, 2018.) See Exhibit 3.

6 126. Pursuant to the validation statutes cited herein, Heritage Fields requests that each of

7 the unlawful Project Approvals made by the County be invalidated; that this Court issue one or more

8 peremptory writs of mandamus ordering the County to rescind, set aside and invalidate all or part of

9 the unlawful Project Approvals as proven at trial or hearing on this matter, and requests that the Court

10 issue a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, and a permanent injunction, all

11 enjoining the County and its agents, employees, and subdivisions from approving the Project

12 Approvals absent the County's full compliance with legal requirements under State and local laws.

13 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

14 127. In each of the items enumerated above, the County has violated its duty under the law,
15 abused its discretion, failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and decided to take the actions

16 objected to without the support of substantial evidence. Accordingly, certification of the EIR and

17 approval of the Lowe Development Plan must be set aside.

18 128. Therefore, Heritage Fields prays for entry of judgment against the County and Real

19 Party in Interest Lowe as follows:

20 A. For an alternative and peremptory writ of mandate, commanding the County:
21 (1) To set aside and vacate the certification of the EIR, Findings and Statement of
22 Overriding Considerations supporting the approval of the Lowe Development
23 Plan and Master Lease; and

24 (2) To set aside and vacate the approval of the Lowe Development Plan and

25 Master Lease based upon the EIR, Findings and Statement of Overriding
26 Considerations.

27

28

Gibson, Dunn & 30
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

B. For an order precluding the County and Lowe from taking any action to construct

2 facilities, infrastructure, or undertake site preparation until an adequate EIR is

3 prepared and timely resubmitted to this Court;

4 C. For a declaration that the County has failed to fulfill its statutory and contractual

5 obligations by approving a private land use plan within the jurisdiction boundaries of

6 the City;

7 D. For damages, including but not limited to those for breach of contract, lost profits,

8 expenses, diminution in value of property and business, and prospective profits;
9 E. For punitive damages for inflicting an intentional tort against the Plaintiff, with the

10 intent to harm Plaintiff as more specifically pled above;

11 F. For injunctive relief precluding County or Lowe from taking any action to advance the

12 Project;

13 G. For specific performance under the terms of the contract;

14 H. For costs of the suit;

15 L. For reasonable attorney's fees; and

16 J. For such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.
