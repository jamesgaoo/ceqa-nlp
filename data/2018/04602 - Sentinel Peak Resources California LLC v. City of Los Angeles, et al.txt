VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

INTRODUCTION

2 1. Since January 2017, Petitioner Sentinel Peak California Resources LLC

3 ("Petitioner") has been the owner and operator of what is commonly referred to as the

4 Jefferson Drill Site, located at 1349-1375 Jefferson Boulevard in the City of Los Angeles

5 (the "Jefferson Site").

0 2. Respondent the City of Los Angeles (the "City"), acting by and through its

7 Chief Zoning Administrator ("ZA"), first authorized oil drilling and production at the

8 Jefferson Site in 1965.
9 3. Since then, the City and its ZAs have approved additional drilling and
10 redrilling, recognizing the site's public benefits as a domestic source of oil and gas, and
11 concluding that operations do not negatively impact the surrounding community. The City
12 and its Fire Department have approved and permitted all existing wells.
13 4. These prior approvals, and Petitioner's reliance on them, establish vested
14 property rights to continue current operations under existing conditions.
15 5. As an oil production facility, the Jefferson Site is subject to broad regulation by
16 several agencies and has a long history of compliance and peaceful operation. The ZA's
17 1965 approval (ZA Case No. 17528) contains a comprehensive set of conditions to ensure
18 the site is operated in a manner to protect the community. In addition, operations are
19 carefully regulated by the California Division of Oil, Gas, and Geo-thermal Resources
20 (*DOGGR"), the City's Fire Department ("City Fire"), and the South Coast Air Quality
21 Management District ("SCAQMD"), all of whom regularly inspect the site and require
22 compliance with current regulations. Despite frequent inspections and responses to
23 community concerns, these agencies have not found any community impacts. Neither has
24 the City. There is not one current, or even recent, notice of violation from the City.
25 6. In 2016, the City, through its ZA, demanded several times that Petitioner's
26 predecessor file a "Plan Approval" application, even though it did not seek any new
27 approvals. As is well-established by the City's prior approvals for the Jefferson Site, the
28 Plan Approval process is strictly an applicant-initiated procedure that is used to authorize

2
VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 new or expanded uses. As those approvals demonstrate, when an applicant proposes new

2 uses it requests a Plan a Approval from the City, who in turn can require those new uses be
3 subject to operating conditions. That is the extent of what it allowed under the Plan

4 Approval process. It does not provide for and is not an enforcement mechanism; it cannot be

5 used to enforce alleged code violations or abate purported public nuisances.

6 7. Nonetheless, the City insisted that Petitioner's predecessor file a Plan Approval

7 application without any justification-in essence, to reexamine its existing vested uses. The

8 City's demand for a Plan Approval relied on unsubstantiated complaints and a 2014 odor
incident raised by SCAQMD that had been resolved immediately by Petitioner's
10 predecessor. The City did not identify any code violations or any violations of the applicable

11 conditions, not a single one.
12 8. Still, in January 2017, Respondent Theodore L. Irving, in his official capacity
13 as Assistant ZA, held an unprecedented hearing to reexamine Petitioner's existing vested
14 uses, Petitioner is unaware of any City staff ever instigating a similar "Plan Approval"
15 process where there was no application on file.
16 9: In October 2017, the ZA issued a 50-page decision that adjudicated never-
17 before-alleged violations and imposed 15 pages of new and revised conditions, which among

18 other things, ordered Petitioner to construct a 45-foot enclosure around the nearly 2-acre
19 Jefferson Site. According to the ZA, the decision "supersede[d]" all prior approvals.

20 10. To modify existing discretionary approvals, the ZA, like all other City staff,
21 must follow procedures established by the Los Angeles Municipal Code ("LAMC"). But the
22 ZA did not rely on or follow the pertinent procedures, which were adopted to ensure vested
23 rights are protected. The ZA did not even acknowledge Petitioner's vested rights, or try to
24 meet the requirements for infringing on them.
25 11. The procedures that led to the decision violated bedrock constitutional

26 principles. For example, the ZA simultaneously alleged and adjudicated new purported
27 violations that were never presented to Petitioner; it relied extensively on evidence received
28 more than six months after the hearing, without allowing Petitioner a chance to address or

3
VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

rebut it; and it did not separate its functions, acting as the decision's investigator, prosecutor,
2 and decision-maker.

3 12. In addition, the ZA did not verify any of the alleged impacts and did not

4 compare them to established legal standards, which was critical because they contradicted

5 the regulatory records showing only minor violations that were immediately corrected. Nor

6 did the ZA study any of the decision's obvious environmental impacts, in violation of the

7 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA").

13. The Determination is an abuse of Respondents' discretion, is in excess of their
9 jurisdiction, is the result of unfair and unconstitutional proceedings, and is brimming with
10 legal and factual errors--all of which prejudiced Petitioner. Therefore, Petitioner is entitled

11 to a writ of mandate commanding Respondents to set aside the Determination.
12 PARTIES

13 14. Petitioner Sentinel Peak Resources California LLC is a Delaware limited

14 liability company that owns and manages the Jefferson Site.
15 15. Respondent City of Los Angeles is a municipal corporation located in Los
16 Angeles County, California.
17 16. Respondent South Los Angeles Area Planning Commission is a hearing board
18 of the City of Los Angeles Planning Department.
19 17. Respondent Theodore L. Irving is an Assistant Zoning Administrator of the
20 City of Los Angeles Planning Department.
21 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

22 18. Venue is proper in. Los Angeles County in accordance with Code of Civil
23 Procedure §§ 393(b), 398(1)(b), and 394(a) because the Jefferson Site is located in Los
24 Angeles County.
25 19. The Court has jurisdiction over this matter in accordance with Code of Civil

26 Procedure § 1094.5 and Public Resources Code $ 21168.
27 20. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing this action, including
28 but not limited to, exhausting all administrative remedies and providing notice to third

4
VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

parties as required by law.

2 ADDITIONAL FACTS

3 21. In 1994, the Associate ZA authorized redrilling and found that "[t]he *Jefferson

4 Drill Site' has been operated in conforinance with all conditions imposed under previous

5 grants" and that no "adverse impacts on adjacent properties and improvements have been

6 identified.»

7 22. In 1999, the Associate ZA allowed Petitioner's predecessor to modify the 1965

8 approval, which required four lots directly north of the Jefferson Site to remain under

9 common ownership. In addition, the City authorized the predecessor to record covenants on

10 the grant deed transferring title to the subsequent owner. The covenants notify owners of the
11 site's operations, require owners notify all tenants of the operations, and prohibit either from
12 claiming that they create a nuisance.
13 23. In 2006, in a proper use of the Plan Approval process, the Associate ZA
14 approved a request by Sentinel's predecessor to redrill wells ("PA1"). The ZA found that
15 operations allowed under the PAI approval would be "under strict controls as to the possible
16 it impacts it may have on the immediate vicinity of the production site" and the approval "will
17 be of direct benefit to the public as a whole":
18 In a time where dependence on foreign oil comes at an increasingly higher social, economical and political cost, it can
19 be found that this approval, by encouraging and facilitating local oil production, under strict controls as to the possible impacts it
20 may have on the immediate vicinity of the production site, will be of direct benefit to the public as a whole.
21
24.
22 The ZA conditioned the PA1 grant such that it expired after 36 months, and

23 explained that "[u]pon completion of the re-drilling operations, production activities will be

24 resumed under the terms and conditions of previous grants."

25.
25 In 2007, the Associate ZA approved additional redrilling operations ("PA2"),

26 a again through a proper use of the Plan Approval process. While considering the approval, it

27 was determined that "no complaints had been received from constituents living in the

28 immediate vicinity of the site." Again, the ZA conditioned this approval such that it expired
after 36 months and concluded that it "will be of direct benefit to the public as a whole."
5
VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

26. To address the potential for noise impacts during the drilling operations

2 authorized by the PA2 approval, the ZA required in PA2 a "30-foot high sound wall on three

3 sides of the drilling rig." However, due to "concerns as to the visual impacts of the sound

4 wall," the ZA required that the "sound wall shall not be maintained for more than 120

5 continuous days." Sentinel's predecessor requested that a condition in the approval requiring

6 a "10-foot high sound blanket around the drilling rig floor" be omitted "due to concerns . .

7 about workers safety, in that it 'effectively eliminates emergency escape routes for the

8 crew.'3 The ZA granted the request in PA2 "[c]onsidering that no complaints were received

9 from abutting neighbors regarding sounds impacts from the current operation."

10 27. In 2008, the Associate ZA approved additional redrilling ("PA3"). The ZA

11 found that "[s]ince [the PA2 grant] this Zoning Administrator has not been made aware of
12 any current concern, and the public hearing for this application was consequently waived,
13 under the assumption that the current conditions of operation at this location are effective in
14  reasonably mitigating any possible impact of the use of the site for drilling operations. The
15 same conditions are therefore applied to this application, consistent with the current mode of
16 operation at the site." The PA.3 was also conditioned such that it expired after 36 months and
17 found to "be of direct bencfit to the public as a whole."
18 28. Oil and gas production is a heavily-regulated industry, subject to oversight by
19 DOGGR, SCAQMD, City Fire, and other agencies. Despite their regular inspections,
20 extensive regulations, and responses to community complaints, the record contains only a
21 few minor violations from SCAQMD associated with equipment malfunctions and a single
22 notice of violation from DOGGR that resulted from the failure to provide timely notification

23 SO an agency representative could witness certain well-related operations. The SCAQMD
24 violations were immediately remedied to the agency's satisfaction, and the DOGGR
25 violation has not happened again. The record does not contain any violations from the City,
26 or any violations that resulted in documented community impacts.
27 29. All fluids produced at the Jefferson Site are contained within a closed-loop
28 system, and remain within vapor-controlled tanks and piping. These fluids are then

6
VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

transferred via underground pipelines-regulated by the California State Fire Marshall and

2 U.S. Department of Transportation-which prevents exposure to the community.

3 30. In 2014, SCAQMD conducted an extensive inspection of the Jefferson Site in

4 response to community concerns, called "Blue Sky" inspection, which is generally reserved

5 for refineries. The agency again found no community impacts and did not issue any notices

6 of violation.

7 31. In August 2016, the ZA wrote to Petitioner's predecessor and stated that it was

8 "requiring the filing of a Plan Approval application for a review of compliance with the

• conditions imposed under ZA 1965-17528 (PA3)." The ZA asserted its authority was

10 "[b]ased on the authority provided to the Zoning Administrator in LAMC Section 13.01,
11 Condition 10 of the [PA3 approval], and evidence received by the Office of Zoning
12 Administration and established in the record."

13 32. The predecessor responded and explained that the Jefferson Site was in full

14 compliance with all applicable laws and conditions and that the ZA had not demonstrated

15 any legal justification for an intrusion on its vested rights.
16 3.3. The Associate ZA replied in September 2017, which it asserted "serve[d] as
17 the second and final notification" that it was "requiring the filing of a Plan Approval

18 application for review of compliance with conditions imposed under ZA 1965-17528
19 (PA3)." The ZA asserted the same purported authority as before but included four "sources
20 of evidence" that it alleged supported the request.
21 34. Petitioner's predecessor responded and addressed how each alleged "source"
22 of evidence was incorrect or insufficient. For example, the ZA cited an odor complaint
23 SCAQMD received, which led to a site inspection and report. The predecessor explained
24 that the inspector had not detected any petroleum or diesel odors at surrounding properties.

25 Further, the report noted that one of the complainants admitted to the investigator that he or
26 she had not actually smelled any odors, but had called in the complaint fraudulently.
27 35. The ZA did not respond to the predecessor's second letter, but issued a two-

28 page "Notice of Public Hearing." The notice provided that the hearing's only purpose was

7
VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

"to obtain testimony from affected and/or interested persons regarding the operation of the

2 facility pursuit [sic] to the conditions imposed under ZA-1965-17528(PA3)." The ZA stated
3 it would consider, "a Zoning Administrator's Approval of Plans to review the applicant's

4 compliance with and the effectiveness of the conditions imposed under ZA-1965-

5 17528(PA3)." It also asserted that "[t]he decision maker will consider all the testimony

6 presented at the hearing, written communication received prior to or at the hearing, and the
7 status of the operations relative to existing environmental and land use regulations and the
8 conditions established in the grant ZA-1965-17528 (PA3)."
9 36. The ZA did not provide Petitioner with any other notice. There was no

10 complaint, brief, or staff report in which the ZA presented its arguments in a form in which

11 Petitioner could respond to them, prepare to respond to them, or. cure them. The ZA did not
12 issue any charging document or otherwise provide Petitioner with notice of any specific
13 violation of law, regulation, or operating condition that had purportedly been violated.
14 37. On January 26, 2017, Respondent Assistant ZA Theodore Irving held the
15 hearing. At the hearing, the ZA did not present a case against Petitioner and did not allege
16 any specific violations of law operating conditions that had purportedly been violated. or

17 38. None of the testimony provided at the hearing alleged any specific violations
18 of law or operating condition that had purportedly been violated.
19 39. The ZA did not set time limit for its presentation, but limited Petitioner to
20 only a few minutes, which was inadequate. Petitioner was not allowed to put on any
21 witnesses, cross-examine adverse witnesses, or rebut evidence.
22 40. The ZA did not separate its prosecutorial and decision-making functions before
23 or during the hearing. The ZA served as the investigator and prosecutor in the proceedings
24 leading up to the hearing, and then acted as the prosecutor and decision-maker at the hearing.
25 41. Petitioner is informed and believes that the City and its ZAs have allowed, and

26 engaged in, ex parte communications before and after the January 2017 hearing. Petitioner
27 further alleges that they have had communications between themselves and with third parties

28 without disclosing those communications or providing Petitioner an opportunity to respond

8
VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

to what was said orally or stated in written documents.

2 42. On October 13, 2017. the ZA issued Case No. ZA-1965-17528 (PA5)

3 Approval of Plans--Determination of Methods and Conditions (the "Determination"), which

4 did not actually "approve" anything. As the ZA admits, it "is not a renewal or a re-approval
5 to allow expansion of the operation."

6 43. The Determination attached, incorporated, and heavily relied on a 17-page
7 report regarding the Jefferson Site that was prepared by the Los Angeles Petroleum
8 Administrator. The report is dated September 22, 2017, and was apparently prepared many
months after the hearing. The report asserted new alleged violations and facts--including
10 never-before-mentioned purported violations that were approximately 15-years old. The
11 Petroleum Administrator also recommended new operating conditions. Before issuing the
12 Determination, the ZA did not provide Petitioner with an opportunity to review this report,
13 rebut its contents, voluntarily provide the requested changes, or respond in any way.
14 44. Despite being the prosecutor at the hearing, the ZA was the Determination's
15 decision-maker. Since the ZA did not provide prior notice of any alleged violations, each
16 violation alleged in the Determination was new. Some of them were decades old, and no
17 prior ZA had asserted they were violations. The Determination also included many new
18 alleged facts, and incorporated the Petroleum Administrator's September 2017 report,
19 Petitioner was not provided an opportunity to submit evidence on or rebut these new alleged
20 violations or facts before the Determination was issued. Had the opportunity been provided,
21 Petitioner could have corrected the many legal and factual errors.

22 45. The ZA did not compare any alleged impacts against standards established by
23 law. It did not analyze whether a single alleged community impact violated existing
24 operating conditions, City ordinances, or any other law.
25 46. Rather, the ZA relied almost exclusively on unsubstantiated testimony from the
26 community. It never verified whether this testimony was accurate, which was critical since
27 the documented regulatory records and prior ZA approvals contradict this testimony,
28 | substantiate the lack of community impacts, and show there were no outstanding notices of

9
VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

P violation.

2 47. The Determination imposed many new conditions on the Jefferson Site and

3 incorporated conditions from the PAI, PA2, and PA3 approvals. The ZA did not study,

4 analyze, or make findings on whether these conditions would alleviate the alleged harm, or

5 whether less onerous operating conditions would work better. The conditions would require

6 Petitioner to curtail or cease it operations, or both, for an unknown time, causing significant
financial harm to the company and its employees, including irreparable harm to its business
goodwill and client relationships. The ZA did not find that the conditions bear any

9 relationship to the impacts they supposedly address.
10 48. The ZA did not study the significant environmental impacts that would result

11 from imposing these new conditions, including the requirement to construct a 45-foot
12 enclosure around the nearly 2-acre site. If even feasible, constructing the wall will have
13 significant impacts on underground and above-ground utilities, and will have significant
14 aesthetic impacts. Other environmental impacts are likely, but unknown, because they have
15 not been studied. No exemptions apply to such a significant construction project.
16 49. Petitioner timely appealed the Determination to the South Los Angeles Area
17 Planning Commission (the "APC") with an initial 15-page letter, supplemented by a 23-page
18 letter, both of which described the decision's legal and factual problems.

19 50. To file its appeal, Respondents required Petitioner to pay the appeal fees
20 established for applicants-which totaled approximately $6,000-even though it did not
21 submit any application. Petitioner's fees should have been only $89.
22 51. The ZA never replied to the Petitioner's appeal papers. Nor did anyone else
23 from the City. There was no opposition, brief, or staff report responding to Petitioner's legal
24 and factual arguments.

25 52. On January 16, 2018, the APC held a hearing on the appeal. Despite being the

26 Determination's decision-maker, the ZA again took on the prosecutorial role before the APC.
27 The APC did not limit the ZA's presentation time. But it did limit Petitioner's presentation

28 to 10 minutes, which was inadequate to present a case or rebut evidence. Petitioner's

10
VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

counsel was not provided an opportunity to put on witnesses, questions witnesses, or Cross-
2 examine adverse witnesses.

3 53. The ZA's presentation included new arguments and evidence that it had never

4 previously argued and that were not part of the Determination. Petitioner was not provided
S an opportunity to prepare to rebut these arguments.
54. Petitioner is informed and believes that the ZA, who acted as a proseçutor on

7 the appeal, and the APC, the appeal decision-makers, had ex parte communications and did

8 not disclose them or provide an opportunity to respond.
9 55. On January 25, 2018, the APC issued a Letter of a Determination, which denied
10 Petitioner's appeal and adopted the Determination in full.
11 56. The APC did not act like neutral decision-makers or an appellate body. It did
12 not rule on any of the legal or factual issues Petitioner raised in its appeal or supplemental
13 submittal, and did not even bother to correct the Determination's undisputed factual errors.
14 In effect, the APC relied on the ZA, who was acting as a prosecutor on the appeal, to decide
15 the case for them.

16 57. The Determination will prevent Petitioner from producing oil at the Jefferson
17 Site because it will require the relocation of underground pipes, which provide the only
18 feasible method to transport fluids off site. Construction of the enclosure would similarly
19 require operations be stopped or curtailed. During this time, Petitioner will be deprived of
20 all beneficial uses of its property. This also substantially interferes with Petitioner's
21 investment-backed expectation of continued operations in accordance with existing
22 approvals and vested rights.

23 58. The Jefferson Site is no different from other oil production sites located in the

24 City, and is similar to many other industrial businesses. Respondents have intentionally
25 treated the Jefferson Site differently from other similarly situated oil production sites and
26 industrial businesses by initiating never-before-used procedures and imposing never-before-
27 used conditions, such as an open-air vapor recovery system.
28 59. The Determination is Respondents' final action and is ripe for judicial review.

11
VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

FIRST COUNT
(CCP § 1094.5)
(Prejudicial Abuse Of Discretion: Failed To Proceed In Manner Required By Law)

60. Petitioner incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 59 above.

5 61. Code of Civil Procedure 8 1094.5(b) provides that an agency's decision can be

6 challenged on the ground that there was a "prejudicial abuse of discretion." "Abuse of
7 discretion is established if the respondent has not proceeded in the manner required by law."
62. In order to justify an interference with the constitutional right to carry on a

0 lawful business it must appear that the interests of the public require such interference and

10 that the means are reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the purpose, and are not
11 unduly oppressive upon the business.
12 63. Petitioner has an established constitutional right to carry on its lawful business

13 at the Jefferson Site according to the terms of its existing discretionary zoning approvals.

14 64. The Determination interferes with Petitioner's vested rights.

15 65. Respondents have not have not attempted to obtain and have not obtained a

16 substantial nuisance or code enforcement determination such that they have established the

17 interests of the public require the Determination and its interference with Petitioner's vested

18 rights.

19 66. Respondents have not established that the conditions imposed by the

20 Determination are reasonably necessary to accomplish the Determination's purported
21 purpose.
22 67. The conditions imposed by the Determination are also unduly oppressive on

23 Petitioner.

24 68. By interfering with Petitioner's vested rights without the requisite basis, and by
25 imposing conditions that are unduly oppressive, Respondents have not proceeded in a
26 manner required by law.

27 69. In order to modify existing discretionary zoning approvals, Respondents must
28 follow the procedures and standards set forth in LAMC § 12.27.1. coR

12 VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

70. The Determination modified Petitioner's existing discretionary zoning

2 approvals, but Respondents did not follow the procedure and standards set forth in LAMC §

3 12.27.1.

4 71. By not following the required procedures and standards, Respondents have

5 failed to proceed in a manner required by law.
6 72. In adjudicatory actions, the law requires that agencies use legal standards by
which to measure alleged violations against.

8 73. When issuing the Determination, Respondents did not establish or use legal
standards against which they could measure the alleged violations.
10 74. By not establishing or applying legal standards, Respondents failed to proceed
11 in a manner required by law.

12 75. The law requires a valid justification for holding a hearing to modify the terms

13 of an existing discretionary zoning approval.
14 76. Respondents asserted they conducted the hearing that resulted in the
15 Determination so that they could review compliance with the PA3 approval.
16 77. By its terms, the PA3 approval is legally inoperative.
17 78. By conducting a hearing to review a legally inoperative discretionary zoning
18 approval, Respondents have not proceeded a in a manner required by law.
19 79. When making a discretionary land use decision, Respondents must consider

20 the decision's environmental impacts and must comply with CEQA.

21 80. When issuing the Determination, Respondents did not consider the project's

22 environmental impacts and did not comply with CEQA.
•23 81. By not considering the Determination's environmental impacts and by not
24 complying with CEQA, Respondents did not proceed in the manner required by law.

25 82. The law requires agencies to abide by the provisions of the U.S. and California
26 Constitutions, including the due process and equal protection clauses.
27 83. Before, during, and after the proceedings that led to the Determination, and.
28 through the Determination, Respondents violated Petitioner's rights protected by the U.S.

13
VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

and California Constitution.

2 84. By infringing on Petitioner's constitutional rights, Respondents did not proceed

3 in a manner required by law.

4 85. Therefore, Respondents abused their discretion.

5 86. Respondents' abuse of discretion was prejudicial.
