28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) F

1 INTRODUCTION
2 1. Petitioner Golden State Environmental Justice Alliance (*Petitioner") challenges
3 the Colony Commerce East Specific Plan ("Project"), located in the County of San Bernardino.
4 The proposed Project analyzed in the EIR calls for the development of approximately 2,362,215
5 square feet of industrial and business park development on approximately 95 acres of land.
6
2. The City of Ontario ("Respondent") certified the Environmental Impact Report
7 ("EIR") for the Project.
8
3. In approving the Project, the Respondent violated provisions of CEQA requiring
9 that the EIR adequately analyze significant adverse environmental impacts. The Respondent
10 further violated the requirement that it analyze a reasonable range of alternatives, and that it
11 adopt an environmentally superior alternative. Respondent failed to adopt all feasible mitigation
12 for project impacts, and the analysis of impacts and the planned mitigation measures is uncertain
13 and is unreasonably deferred. The level of review adopted by Respondent was insufficient and
14 therefore did not allow decision makers to intelligently consider the environmental consequences
15 of the Project.
16
4. Respondent's Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations were
17 not supported by substantial evidence in the record. The Statement of Overriding Considerations
18 was improperly adopted when feasible mitigation measures and alternatives existed to lessen
19 significant project impacts.
20

21 JURISDICTION AND VENUE
22
5. This Court has jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and
23 1094.5 and for declaratory relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 1060. The Court has
24 jurisdiction of CEQA matters pursuant to Pub. Resources Code sections 21168, 21168.5, and
25
21168.9.
26
6. Venue is proper in this Court because the Respondent and Project are located in
27 San Bernardino County and the actions giving rise to the causes of action herein transpired in
28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 2

F San Bernardino County. See Code of Civil Procedure §§ 393 and 394.
2 7. This action is timely filed within 30 days of the posting of the Notice of
3 Determination under CEQA.
4
8. Petitioner has exhausted its administrative remedies by commenting on the
5 Project prior to the close of the public hearing on the Project in compliance with Public
6 Resources Code section 21177(b).
7
9. Petitioner has complied with CEQA by filing and serving with this Petition for
8 Writ of Mandate a Notice to the City of Intent to File pursuant to Pub. Resources Code section
9 21167.5, a Notice to Attorney General of Commencement of Action pursuant to Pub. Resources
10 Code section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388, and a Notice of Commencement
11 of Action to Responsible Agencies pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6.5.
12

13
PARTIES
14
10. Petitioner Golden State Environmental Justice Alliance ("Petitioner") is a
15 California not for profit corporation devoted to the preservation of the environment as well as the
16 promotion of safe and healthy communities. It is a corporation formed and operating under the
17 laws of the State of California. Members of Petitioner are taxpayers who reside in or near the
18 City of Ontario and would be irreparably harmed by the Project's environmental impacts and
19 have an interest in ensuring open, accountable, and responsive government and in protecting the
20 region's environment. Petitioner and its members submitted comments on the Project, bring this
21 action on behalf of the public, and are acting as private attorneys general conferring a significant
22 benefit on the general public or a large class of persons under Code of Civil Procedure section
23 1021.5.
24 11. Respondent City of Ontario (*Respondent") is municipal corporation located in
25 San Bernardino County and the lead agency for the Project under CEQA. Respondent is the
26 agency charged with regulating and administering land use and development within its territory
27 in compliance with the provisions of its General Plan and zoning ordinances as well as
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 3

1 applicable provisions of state law including CEQA. As the lead agency for the Project,
2

3 Respondent has the duty to ensure compliance with these applicable laws. Respondent is
authorized and required by law to hold public hearings, to determine whether CEQA applies to
4

5 development within its jurisdiction, to determine the adequacy of and certify environmental
documents prepared pursuant to CEQA, and to determine whether a project is compatible with
6 the objectives, policies, general land uses, and programs specified in the General Plan.
7
12. Real Party in Interest CapRock Partners, LLC is the applicant for the Project and
8 is therefore served as Real Party in Interest pursuant to Public Resources Code section
9 21167.6.5(a). CapRock Partners, LLC is a Delaware limited liability corporation that is located
10 and does business in the County of San Bernardino, State of California.
11
13. The true names and capacities of the Respondents and Defendants identified as
12 DOES 1 through 100, and of the Real Parties in Interest identified as DOES 101 through 200 are
13 unknown to Petitioner, who will seek the Court's permission to amend this pleading in order to
14

15 allege the true names and capacities as soon as they are ascertained. Petitioner is informed and
believes and on that basis alleges that the fictitiously named Respondents and Defendants
16 through 100 have jurisdiction by law over one or more aspects of the Project that is the subject
17 of this proceeding; and that each of the fictitiously named Real Parties in Interest 101 through
18 200 either claims an ownership interest in the Project or has some cognizable interest in the
19 Project.
20

21 STATEMENT OF FACTS AND COMMON ALLEGATIONS
22 14. Petitioner opposes the Project and challenges certain actions taken by
23 Respondent. In particular, Petitioner seeks to invalidate the approvals with respect to the Project
24 on the grounds that Respondent has violated CEQA, the Planning and Zoning Law, and other
25
laws.
26 15. Petitioner seeks review by and relief from this Court under Public Resources
27 Code Section 21168 or 21168.5 as applicable; and Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1060 et seq.
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 4

and 1084 et seq., among other provisions of law.
2
16. Petitioner has satisfied all exhaustion-of-remedies requirements to maintain this

4 proceeding. By way of example and without limitation, Petitioner submitted written opposition
to the Project during the administrative proceedings for the Project.
5
17. Alternatively, and additionally, neither Public Resources Code Section 21177(a)-
6

7 (b) nor any other exhaustion-of-remedies requirement may be applied to Petitioner.

18.
8 Respondent's conduct in approving the Project without complying with CEQA

9 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion because, as alleged in this pleading, it failed to

10 proceed in the manner required by law and made findings not supported by substantial evidence.

19.
11 Petitioner has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of
law, since its members and other members of the public will suffer irreparable harm as a result of
12

13 Respondent's violations of CEQA and other laws. Respondent's approval of the Project also
rests on the failure to satisfy a clear, present, ministerial duty to act in accordance with those
14 laws. Even when Respondent is permitted or required by law to exercise its discretion in
15 approving projects under those laws, it remains under a clear, present, ministerial duty to
16 exercise its discretion within the limits of and in a manner consistent with those laws.
17

18 Respondent has had and continues to have the capacity and ability to approve the Project within
the time limits of and in a manner consistent with those laws, but Respondent has failed and
19 refused to do so and has exercised its discretion beyond the limits of and in a manner that is not
20 I consistent with those laws.
21
20. Petitioner has a beneficial right and interest in Respondent's fulfillment of all its
22 legal duties as alleged in this pleading.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 5

1 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
2 Failure to Prepare Adequate Environmental Impact Report
3 (Against all Respondents and Real Parties in Interest)
4 21. Paragraphs 1 through 20 are fully incorporated into this paragraph.
5
22. CEQA requires that every environmental impact report identify and analyze the
6

7 significant adverse environmental impacts of a proposed project, giving due consideration to
both short term and long term impacts, providing decision makers with enough information to
8 enable them to make an informed decision with full knowledge of the likely consequences of
9 their actions, and providing members of the public with enough information to participate
10 meaningfully in the project approval and environmental review process. CEQA also requires
11 that every environmental impact report identify and analyze a reasonable range of alternatives to
12 a proposed project. CEQA further requires that every environmental impact report identify and
13
14 analyze all reasonable mitigation measures for a proposed project 's significant adverse
environmental impacts. In each respect, CEQA mandates that the analyses contained in an
15 environmental impact report and all decisions of the lead agency based on the report be
16 supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record.
17 23. The Project's EIR fails to provide adequate identification and analysis of the
18 significant adverse environmental impacts of the Project. Further, neither the analysis of impacts
19 in the Project's EIR nor Respondent's certification of the EIR in this respect is supported by
20 substantial evidence in the administrative record.
21
24. The EIR is inadequate in ways that include, but are not limited to, those described
22
below.
23 Unsubstantiated Input Parameters Used to Estimate Project Emissions
24 25. According to the EIR, the California Emissions Estimator Model Version
25

26 CalEEMod.2016.3.1 ("CalEEMod") was used to estimate the criteria air pollutant emissions
generated during Project construction and operation (p. 5.3-16). CalEEMod provides
27 recommended default values based on site specific information, such as land use type,
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 6

1 meteorological data, total lot acreage, project type and typical equipment associated with project
2 type. If more specific project information is known, the user can change the default values and
3 input project-specific values, but CEQA requires that such changes be justified by substantial
4 evidence. Once all of the values are inputted into the model, the Project's construction and
5 operational emissions are calculated, and "output files" are generated. These output files disclose
6

7 to the reader what parameters were utilized in calculating the Project's emissions and make
known which default values were changed as well as provide a justification for the values
8
selected.
9
26. Several of the values inputted into the model were not consistent with information
10 disclosed in the EIR. As a result, the construction and operational emissions estimated in
11

12 CalEEMod, which the EIR relies upon to determine the significance of the Project's air quality
and health risk impacts, are greatly underestimated. The EIR needs to adequately assess the
13

14 potential impacts that construction and operation of the Project may have on regional and local
air quality and global climate change. P
15 Use of Incorrect Construction Schedule
16 27.
17 Review of the Project's CalEEMod output files for Phase 2 of construction

18 demonstrates that the air pollution model relies upon a construction schedule that is inconsistent a
with the construction schedule provided in the EIR. According to the EIR, Phase 2 of
19 construction is approximately 455 work days (Table 3-4, p. 3-30).
20 28. However, the construction schedule used within the Phase 2 CalEEMod model
21 does not reflect these construction phase durations. Specifically, the Paving and Architectural
22 Coating phases of construction were each only modeled over a 20-day duration, rather than over
23 a 150-day and 45-day duration, respectively (Appendix B, pp. 571, pp. 598). The Project's
24 respective construction phase durations are reflected in the construction schedule provided in the
25 EIR's CalEEMod model (Appendix B, pp. 571, pp. 598).
26 29.
27 The CalEEMod model underestimated the total number of workdays for the

28 Paving phase by a total of 130 days and underestimated the total number of workdays for the

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 7

Architectural Coating phase of Project construction by a total of 25 days. As a result, the
CalEEMod model fails to estimate the criteria air pollutant emissions that will be released during
3 the additional 155 days of Project construction. By substantially reducing the Project's paving
4 and architectural coating phases, the daily emissions associated with these phases are artificially
5 reduced. This discrepancy between the construction schedule outlined in the EIR and the one
6 used to estimate the Project's construction-related emissions presents a significant issue, and
7 results in a potentially significant underestimation of the Project's construction emissions. The
8 CalEEMod model must utilize the correct construction schedule proposed in the EIR.
9 Incorrectly Applied Mitigation Measure to Project Emissions
10 30. Petitioner's review of the EIR and its associated appendices indicates that the
11 Respondent not only incorrectly applied a construction-related mitigation measure to the
12 Project's construction emissions, but also changed the CalEEMod default value for this proposed
13 measure within the model, without providing substantial reasoning for doing so. The application
14 of this measure to the Project's unmitigated construction emissions, in addition to the
15 unsubstantiated decrease in the mitigation measure's CalEEMod default value results in an
16 underestimation of the Project's construction-related emissions. As a result, Petitioner finds the
17 EIR's air model to be incorrect and unreliable and maintain that it should not be relied upon to
18 determine Project significance.
19
31. As stated above, a construction-related mitigation measure was identified by the
20 EIR and was applied to the Project's construction emissions. Specifically, the mitigation
21 measure that was incorrectly applied to the model would limit the construction vehicle speed on
22 unpaved roads as a way to reduce the Project's construction-related fugitive dust emissions
23 (Appendix B, p. 83, p. 157, p. 231, p. 305, p. 566, p. 593, p. 666, p. 682).
24
32. The application of this mitigation measure to the Project's construction emissions,
25 however, is entirely incorrect, as the EIR fails to discuss or even mention the implementation of
26 this mitigation measure during Project construction anywhere in the report or associated
27 attachments. Therefore, application of this mitigation measure to the Project's construction
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 8

1
emissions is unsubstantiated.
2 33. Not only was this measure applied to the Project's construction emissions, even
3 though it's not identified as a mitigation measure by the EIR, but the speed value assigned to this
4 measure within the model was also changed from the default value, without providing substantial
5 evidence to justify this change. The CalEEMod default speed value for a vehicle traveling on
6 unpaved roads is 40 miles per hour (mph), but this value was adjusted from 40 mph to 0 mph
7 within the model (Appendix B, p. 83, p. 157, p. 231, p. 305, p. 566, p. 593, p. 666, p. 682).
8
34. Again, the application of this mitigation measure to the Project's construction
9

10 emissions, however, is entirely incorrect. Inputting a speed of 0 mph into the CalEEMod model
means that the construction vehicle is stationary, and therefore, the CalEEMod model is
11 estimating the Project's construction emissions assuming that there will be no vehicles driving
12 on unpaved roads on the Project site. However, according to the EIR, 10,000 cubic yards of soil
13 export is expected to occur throughout the Project's grading phase, therefore, it can reasonably
14

15 be assumed that vehicles will be traversing back and forth across the Project site during the
Project's construction phases (p. 3-30). As such, it is incorrect to model Project emissions
16

17 assuming there will be no vehicles driving on unpaved roads, as it is clear that a significant
number of vehicles will be driving throughout the Project site during construction to remove soil
18 and debris.
19
35.
20 For these reasons, Petitioner finds the Project's air quality impacts to be
inadequately evaluated and require that a revised EIR be prepared that adequately evaluates and
21 mitigates the Project's air quality impacts to a less-than-significant level.
22

23 Diesel Particulate Matter Health Risk Emissions Inadequately Evaluated
36. The EIR fails to adequately evaluate the potential health risk impact that the
24 proposed Project would have on nearby sensitive receptors because the EIR fails to conduct a
25

26 proper assessment of the Project's construction-related health risk. As a result, the Project's
overall health risk impact is greatly underestimated and misrepresented.
27

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 9

H 37.
2 The EIR fails to properly evaluate the construction-related diesel particulate

3 matter (DPM) emissions that will be emitted during Project construction. The EIR gives no

4 justification for the omission of a proper analysis of the Project's construction emissions.

5 According to the SCAQMD, however, it is recommended that health risk impacts from short-

6 term projects be assessed. The Guidance document states,

7 "Since these short-term calculations are only meant for projects with limits on the

8 operating duration, these short-term cancer risk assessments can be thought of as

9 being the equivalent to a 30-year cancer risk estimate and the appropriate

10 thresholds would still apply (i.e. for a 5-year project, the maximum emissions

11 during the 5-year period would be assessed on the more sensitive population,

12 from the third trimester to age 5, after which the project's emissions would drop

13 to 0 for the remaining 25 years to get the 30-year equivalent cancer risk

14 estimate)."

38.
15 Additionally, OEHHA, the organization responsible for providing

16 recommendations and guidance on how to conduct health risk assessments in California,

17 provides guidance for cancer risk evaluation in short term projects. In February of 2015,

18 OEHHA released its most recent Risk Assessment Guidelines: Guidance Manual for Preparation

19 of Health Risk Assessments, which was formally adopted in March of 2015. The guidance

20 document states that "local air pollution control districts sometimes use the risk assessment

21 guidelines for the Hot Spots program in permitting decisions for short-term projects such as

22 construction or waste site remediation." Furthermore, the guidance documents recommend that

23 that all short-term projects lasting at least two months be evaluated for cancer risks to nearby

24 sensitive receptors. Thus, the EIR should have conducted some sort of quantitative analysis of

25 the Project's construction-related carcinogenic health risk impact and should have compared the

26 results of this analysis to applicable thresholds. The SCAQMD provides a specific numerical

27 threshold of 10 in one million for determining a project's health risk impact. Therefore, the EIR

28 should have conducted an assessment that compares the Project's construction health risk to this

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 10

1
threshold in order to determine the Project's construction-related carcinogenic health risk impact.
2 By failing to prepare a proper construction HRA, the EIR fails to provide a comprehensive
3 analysis of the sensitive receptor impacts that may occur as a result of exposure to substantial air
4 pollutants.
5
Failure to Adequately Evaluate Greenhouse Gas Impact
6
39. The EIR concludes that the Project's greenhouse gas (GHG) impacts would be
7 less than significant, yet fails to provide proper justification to support this claim. As a result,
8 the Project's GHG impacts are inadequately addressed.
9
40. The EIR relies upon the City of Ontario's Climate Action Plan (CAP) to
10 determine the significance of the Project's GHG impact (p. 5.7-11). Using this significance
11 criteria, the EIR concludes,
12 "The Project Design Features would total 103 points on the GHG Screening
13 Threshold Table (provided as Table 5.7-5 herein). Pursuant to the City's CAP,
14 implementation of GHG reduction features that would exceed 100 points on the
15 City's significance level. Therefore, because the proposed Specific Plan
16 (including PA-1, PA-2, and PA-3) would result in 103 points on the GHG
17 Screening Threshold Table, impacts related to the generation of GHG emissions
18 would be less than significant" (p. 5.7-14).
19
41. This conclusion, however, as well as the justification provided in the EIR to
20 support this significance determination, are incorrect and inadequate.
21 42. While the EIR states that the Project would be consistent with CAP, the EIR fails
22 to actually demonstrate compliance with all of the applicable criteria disclosed in the City's
23 CAP. Specifically, the EIR fails to comply with the following requirement, as required by
24 Section 15183.5 Tiering and Streamlining the Analysis of Greenhouse Gas Emissions of the
25 CEQA guidelines,
26 "An environmental document that relies on greenhouse gas reduction plan for a
27 cumulative impacts analysis must identify those requirements specified in the plan
28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 11

that apply to the project, and, if those requirements are not otherwise binding and
2
enforceable, incorporate those requirements as mitigation measures applicable to
3 the project."
4
43. As stated above, CEQA requires the EIR to identify which requirements apply to
the Project and requires that the EIR make these requirements binding and enforceable to the
6
Project by listing them as mitigation measures, if they are not already binding and enforceable in
7 the City's CAP. However, review of the EIR demonstrates that the Project fails to include any of
8
the CAP's measures that the EIR claims the Project would be consistent with as mitigation
9

10 measures or as mandatory conditions of Project approval (Table 1-3: Summary of Impacts,
Mitigation Measures, and Level of Significance, p. 1-18).
11
44.
12 As you can see, the EIR determines that no mitigation is required and therefore

13 does not include any of the CAP's measures within its mitigation. As a result, the EIR fails to
show compliance with the City of Ontario's CAP and should not be used to determine the
14 Project's significance. A revised EIR should be prepared with an updated GHG analysis in order
15 to adequately assess and address the Project's potential GHG impact.
16 Failure to Demonstrate Compliance with Executive Order B-30-15
17 45. According to the EIR, "the CAP also includes a provision that will require an
18 update beginning in 2018 that will quantify emissions from 2030, 2040, and 2050 for the City"
19 (p. 5.7-6). However, since this EIR was prepared prior to the CAP update, the CAP Screening
20 Threshold Table only accounts for the reductions required to meet the 2020 emission reductions
21 set forth by AB 32. Governor Brown recently issued an executive order to establish an even
22 more ambitious GHG reduction target for 2030, which is not addressed in the CAP Screening
23

24 Threshold Table. By failing to demonstrate consistency with the reduction targets set forth by

25 Executive Order B-30-15 for 2030, the Project may conflict with an applicable plan, policy, or
regulation adopted for the purpose of reducing GHG emissions. As a result, the Project may
26 have a potentially significant impact that was not previously addressed in the GHG analysis.
27

28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 12

46. Executive Order B-30-15 requires emissions reductions above those mandated by
2 AB 32 to reduce GHG emissions 40 percent below their 1990 levels by 2030. 1990 statewide
3 GHG emissions are estimated to be approximately 431 million MTCO2e (MMTCO2e).
4 Therefore, by 2030 California will be required to reduce statewide emissions by 172 MMTCO2e
5 (431 x 40%), which results in a statewide limit on GHG emissions of 259 MMTCO2e. 2020
6 "business-as-usual" levels are estimated to be approximately 509 MMTCO2e. In order to
7 successfully reach the 2030 statewide goal of 259 MMTCO2e, California would have to reduce
8 its emissions by 49 percent below the "business-as-usual" levels. This reduction target is
9 consistent with goals set forth by other recently passed legislature, such as SB 32, indicating that
10 compliance with these more aggressive reduction goals, beyond what is mandated by AB 32, will
11
be necessary.
12
47. This 49 percent reduction target should be considered as a threshold of
13 significance against which to measure Project impacts. Because the proposed Project is unlikely
14 to be redeveloped again prior to 2030, the 2030 goals are applicable to any evaluation of the
15 Project's impacts. A revised EIR should be prepared to demonstrate the Project's compliance
16 with these more aggressive measures specified in Executive Order B-30-15. Specifically, the
17 Project should demonstrate, at a minimum, a reduction of 49 percent below "business-as-usual"
18 levels. It should be noted that this reduction percentage is applicable to statewide emissions,
19 which is not directly applicable to a project-level analysis. As a result, an additional analysis
20 would need to be conducted to translate the new statewide targets into a project-specific
21

22 threshold against which Project GHG emissions can be compared. A revised EIR should be
prepared to quantify any reductions expected to be achieved by mitigation measures, shown by
23 substantial evidence that such measures will be effective, and should demonstrate how these
24 measures will reduce the emissions below the new 2030 significance threshold.
25 Failure to Implement All Available Feasible Mitigation Measures
26
48. Based on the emissions estimates provided in the Project's CalEEMod output
27 files, the EIR determines that the Project's operational emissions would exceed the South Coast
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 13

1 Air Quality Management District's (SCAQMD) significance thresholds. As a result, the Project
2 proposes several mitigation measures to reduce the Project's significant criteria air pollutant
3 emissions (Table 1-3: Summary of Impacts, Mitigation Measures, and Level of Significance, p.
4 1-9). However, even after implementation of mitigation, the EIR concludes that the Project's
5 operational air quality impacts would be significant and unavoidable with respect to NOx (p. 5.3-
6 30). While it is true that the Project would result in significant NOx impacts, the EIR's
7 conclusion that these impacts are "significant and unavoidable" is entirely incorrect. According
8 to CEQA, "CEQA requires Lead Agencies to mitigate or avoid significant environmental
9 impacts associated with discretionary projects. Environmental documents for projects that have
10

11 any significant environmental impacts must identify all feasible mitigation measures or
alternatives to reduce the impacts below a level of significance.
12 49. If after the identification of all feasible mitigation measures, a project is still
13

14 deemed to have significant environmental impacts, the Lead Agency can approve a project, but
must adopt a Statement of Overriding Consideration to explain why further mitigation measures
15 are not feasible and why approval of a project with significant unavoidable impacts is
16 warranted." CEQA requires an agency to adopt feasible mitigation measures that will
17 substantially lessen or avoid the Project's potentially significant impacts and to describe those
18 mitigation measures in the EIR. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002, 21081(a), 21100(b)(3); Guidelines
19

20 § 15126.4. The agency must find "that specific overriding economic, legal, social, technological,
or other benefits of the project outweigh the significant effects on the environment." Pub. Res.
21 Code § 21081(b). The statement of overriding considerations must be based on substantial
22 evidence in the record. Pub. Res. Code § 21081.5; Guidelines § 15093(b).
23
50.
24 A lead agency may not conclude that an impact is significant and unavoidable
without requiring the imposition of all feasible mitigation measures to reduce impacts to less
25 than significant levels. Guidelines §§ 15126.4, 15091. Review of the Project's proposed
26 mitigation measures, however, demonstrates that not all feasible mitigation is being
27 implemented. Therefore, the EIR's conclusion that impacts are significant and unavoidable is
28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 14

unsubstantiated. As a result, additional mitigation measures should be identified and
2

3 incorporated in order to reduce the Project's air quality impacts to the maximum extent possible.
Until all feasible mitigation is reviewed and incorporated into the Project's design, impacts from
4 construction-related NOx emissions cannot be considered as significant and unavoidable.
5
51. The Project's EIR fails to provide adequate identification and analysis of
6 measures to mitigate the Project's significant adverse environmental impacts and fails to
7 eliminate or substantially eliminate all such impacts. Neither the analysis of mitigation measures
8 nor Respondent's certification of the EIR in is this respect is supported by substantial evidence in
9
the administrative record.
10
52. Respondent adopted the statement of overriding considerations when feasible
11 mitigation measures and project alternatives existed, in violation of CEQA. Pub. Res. Code
12

13 § 21081; Guidelines § 15092. Respondent also failed to make all required written findings
regarding the Project's impacts. Respondent also approved the Project based on one or more
14 written findings that there exist considerations outweighing the Project's significant adverse
15 environmental impacts, but there is not substantial evidence in the administrative record to
16 support all such findings. Moreover, Respondent approved the Project based on one or more
17 non-written findings that such considerations exist.
18
53. Additionally, and alternatively, the Project's EIR fails to provide adequate
19 identification and analysis of a reasonable range of alternatives to the Project. Neither the
20 analysis of alternatives in the EIR nor Respondent's certification of the EIR in this respect is
21 supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record.
22
54. CEQA requires that an EIR consider a "reasonable range of alternatives,"
23 Guidelines § 15126.6(a), and that the document must include a discussion of alternatives even if
24 to some degree they would limit accomplishment of the project's objectives, or would be more
25 costly. Guidelines § 15126.6(b).
26
55.
27 Respondent failed to adequately identify, analyze, and consider alternatives that
lessened the Project's impacts. The CEQA Guidelines mandate that "The range of potential
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 15

1 alternatives to the proposed project shall include those that could feasibly accomplish most of the
2 basic objectives of the project and could avoid or substantially lessen one or more of the
3 significant effects." Guidelines § 15126.6(c).
4
56. As a result of Respondent's violations of CEQA, Petitioner has been harmed in
5 that the decision makers who approved the Project were not fully informed about the impacts of
6 mitigation measures for and alternatives to the Project prior to its approval, and the Petitioner
7 and the public will have to endure significant, avoidable, unmitigated adverse environmental
8 impacts without there being any (or there being insufficient) benefits to outweigh such impacts.
9 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays
10 1. For the Court's peremptory writ of mandate requiring the Respondent to set aside
11 its decision certifying the EIR for the Project (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168, 21168.5,
12 21168.9, Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085, 1094.5);
13 2.
14 For the Court's peremptory writ of mandate requiring the Respondent to fully
comply with the requirements of CEQA, the State Planning and Zoning Law, and
15 the applicable Municipal Code prior to any future approval of the Project (Pub.
16

17 Res. Code §§ 21168, 21168.5, 21168.9, Gov. Code § 65300 et seq., Code of Civil
Procedure §§ 1085, 1094.5);
18 3. For a judgment enforcing the duty imposed upon the Respondent by CEQA to
19 adequately address potential individual and cumulative impacts to the
20

21 environment in any subsequent action taken regarding the Project;

4.
22 For a judgment enforcing the duty imposed upon the Respondent by CEQA to
adequately consider mitigation to reduce significant impacts in any subsequent
23 action taken to approve the Project;
24
5.
25 For a judgment enforcing the duty imposed upon the Respondent by CEQA to
adopt a feasible environmentally superior alternative to reduce significant impacts
26 in any subsequent action taken to approve the Project;
27
6. For a judgment requiring the County to prepare, circulate and consider a new and
