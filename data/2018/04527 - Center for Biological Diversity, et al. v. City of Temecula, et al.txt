VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

2 INTRODUCTION

1. This action challenges the decision of the City of Temecula and its City Council
3 ("Respondents") to approve the Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") and associated project approvals
4 for the Altair Specific Plan (the "Project"). The Project proposes a development of up to 1,750 dwelling

5 units, 5.1 million square feet of commercial land uses, a highway by-pass, and a "civic" use on the
6 southern portion of the Project area.

7 2. Petitioners CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY, SIERRA CLUB, MOUNTAIN
8 LION FOUNDATION, and THE COUGAR CONNECTION (collectively, "Petitioners") demonstrated
9 throughout the administrative process that the Project will endanger the mountain lion population
10 residing in the Santa Ana Mountains, which are known as the Santa Ana mountain lions. The Santa Ana
11 mountain lions already suffer from the lowest genetic diversity of any population in California because
12 freeways and sprawl development have made it difficult for individual lions to migrate between the
13 Santa Ana Mountains and the inland Peninsular Ranges.
14 3. The Project would interfere with the migration of mountain lions by degrading key
15 wildlife corridors that are essential to the continued survival of the Santa Ana mountain lions. Petitioners
16 along with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (*USFWS"), the California Department of Fish and
17 Wildlife ("CDFW") (collectively, the "Wildlife Agencies") and mountain lion experts such as Dr.
18 Winston Vickers repeatedly informed the City of the severe and permanent impacts of the Project on the
19 Santa Ana mountain lions. Nonetheless, the City failed to disclose or adequately evaluate these
20 environmental impacts in the EIR or identify effective mitigation measures, rendering the EIR
21 inadequate under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code sections
22 21000 et seq.

23 4. The Project also is inconsistent with the Western Riverside County Multiple Species
24 Habitat Conservation Plan ("MSHCP"). The EIR contains misleading and inaccurate MSHCP
25 consistency analyses, despite letters from the Wildlife Agencies and Petitioners informing the City of
26 the numerous errors in the analyses. The Project is further inconsistent with the MSHCP because the
27 City and the developer failed to comply with the Criteria Refinement process even though the Project
28
p
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

departs from the conservation goals set forth in the MSHCP. The Project's inconsistency with the

2 MSHCP amounts to a significant impact under CEQA which was not mitigated by the City. Because the
3 City's General Plan incorporates the MSHCP, the City's approval of the Project is inconsistent with the

4 City's General Plan and therefore violates California's Planning and Zoning Law.

5 5. In addition to impacts on the Santa Ana mountain lions, the Project will have significant
6 impacts on bio logical resources, special status species, air quality, greenhouse gases ("GHGs"), water

7 supplies, water quality, aesthetics, and traffic, among other impacts. The EIR does not disclose or

8 adequately evaluate these environmental impacts, nor does it identify effective mitigation measures to
9 alleviate these impacts.

10 THE PARTIES

11 6. Petitioner CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY (the "Center") is a non-profit
12 conservation organization dedicated to the protection of native species and their habitats through
13 science, policy, and environmental law. The Center has approximately 63,000 members worldwide,
14 including residents of Riverside County and within the local communities in the vicinity of Temecula.
15 The Center has worked for many years to protect imperiled plants and wildlife, open space, air and
16 water quality, and the overall quality of life for people in the Western Riverside County where the
17 Project is proposed. Members of the Center objected to the approval and construction of the Project and
18 will be directly and adversely affected by the Project.

19 7. Petitioner SIERRA CLUB (the "Club") is a non-profit corporation, organized under the
20 laws of the State of California, with its headquarters in Oakland, California. The Club is a national

21 conservation organization with over 830,000 members. The general mission of the Club includes the
22 enjoyment, enhancement, protection, and preservation by all lawful means of the forests, waters,
23 wildlife, wilderness, and other natural and scenic resources of the United States and the Earth in general.
24| The Club and its members believe that habitat alteration and elimination, diminishing water supplies,
25 and global climate change effects from greenhouse gases pose critical threats to the continued well-
26 | being of human beings and healthy fish and wildlife population alike. The San Gorgonio Chapter of the
27

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Sierra Club has approximately 7,500 members who reside in Riverside and San Bernardino counties.

2 The Santa Margarita Group of the San Gorgonio Chapter has approximately 760 members.

3 8. Petitioner MOUNTAIN LION FOUNDATION (the "Foundation") is a non-profit public
4 benefit corporation incorporated in the State of California in 1986. The Foundation's mission is to

5 protect mountain lions and their habitat. For 31 years, the Foundation has worked with member
6 volunteers and activists to create and further wildlife policies that seek to protect mountain lions, people,

7 and domestic animals without resorting to lethal measures. The Foundation has approximately 7,000

8 members.

9 9. Petitioner THE COUGAR CONNECTION ("Cougar Connection") is a non-profit, public
10 interest organization that is dedicated to the preservation of Puma concolor, Cougar populations, open
11 space, wildlife connectivity, and public education.

12 10. Members of the Center, the Club, the Foundation, and Cougar Connection have
13 environmental, educational, recreational, scientific, and aesthetic interests in the Project area and its
14 plants and wildlife. These interests will be directly and adversely affected by the Project, which vio lates
15 provisions of law as set forth in this Petition and which would cause irreversible harm to the natural
16 environment and its recreational assets. The Center, the Club, the Foundation, and Cougar Connection
17 and their members have a direct and beneficial interest in Respondents' compliance with CEQA and
18 California Code of Regulations, title 14, section 15000 et seq. ("CEQA Guidelines"). The maintenance
19 and prosecution of this action will confer a substantial benefit on the public by protecting the public
20 from the environmental and other harms alleged herein.

21 11. Respondent CITY OF TEMECULA (the "City"), a political subdivision of the State of
22 California, is responsible for regulating and controlling land use in the territory of the City, including
23 implementing and complying with the provisions of CEQA. The City is the "lead agency" for the
24 purposes of Public Resources Code Section 21067, with principal responsibility for conducing
25 environmental review of the proposed actions. The City has a duty to comply with CEQA and other
26 state laws.

27

28
3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

12. Respondent CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF TEMECULA (the "City Council") is

2 the duly elected decisionmaking body of the City. As the decisionmaking body, the City Council is
3 charged with the responsibilities under CEQA for conducting a proper review of the proposed action's

4 environmental impacts and granting the various approvals necessary for the Project.

13. Petitioners are informed and believe Real Party in Interest AMBIENT COMMUNITIES,
6 LLC ("Ambient") is incorporated in the State of Delaware and does business in the State of California,
7 and is the sole identified applicant for approval of the Project.

14. Petitioners are informed and believe that Real Party in Interest TEMECULA VILLAGE
9 WEST, LLC, is incorporated in the State of Delaware and does business in the State of California, and is
10 the signatory to the Development Agreement for the Project.

11 15. Petitioners do not know the true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate,
12 associate, or otherwise, of respondents DOES 1 through 20, 1 inclusive, and therefore sue said
13 respondents under fictitious names. Petitioners will amend this Petition to show their true names and

14 capacities when the same have been ascertained. Each of the respondents is the agent and/or employee
15 of Respondents, and each performed acts on which this action is based within the course and scope of
16 such Respondents' agency and/or employment.

17 16. Petitioners do not know the true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate,
18 associate, or otherwise, of real parties in interest DOES 21 through 40, inclusive, and therefore sue said
19 real parties in interest under fictitious names. Petitioners will amend this Petition to show their true

20 names and capacities when the same have been ascertained.

21 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

22 17. This Court has jurisdiction to issue a Writ of Mandate to set aside Respondents' decision
23 to approve the Project under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 (alternatively section

24 1085) and Public Resources Code sections 21168.5 (alternatively 21168) and 21168.9.

25 18. Venue for this action properly lies in the Riverside County Superior Court because
26 Respondents and the proposed site of the Project are located in the County. Many of the significant
27

28
4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 environmental impacts of the Project that are the subject of this lawsuit would occur in Riverside
2 County, and the Project would impact the interests of Riverside County residents.
3 19. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
4  21167.5 by serving written notices of Petitioners' intention to commence this action on Respondents on

5 January 10, 2018. A copy of the written notices and proof of service are attached hereto as Exhibit A.

6 20. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
7 21167.6 by concurrently notifying Respondents of Petitioners' election to prepare the record of
8 administrative proceedings relating to this action. A copy of Petitioners' election to prepare the record of

9 administrative proceedings is attached hereto as Exhibit B.
10 21. Each Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this instant
11 action and has exhausted any and all administrative remedies to the extent required by law, including,
12 but not limited to, submitting extensive written and oral comments-either jointly and individually-
13 objecting to the approval of the Project and presenting to Respondents the flaws in its environmental
14 review on, inter alia, June 17, 2016, November 30, 2016, February 14, 2017, November 15, 2017,
15 December 6, 2017, and December 12, 2017.

16 22. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
17 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside certification of
18 the EIR and approval of the Project. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' approval will
19 remain in effect in violation of state law.

20 23. This petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167 and

21 CEQA Guidelines section 15112.

22 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

23 The Proposed Project

24 24. By this action, Petitioners challenge the decision of Respondents to approve the Project
25 based upon a legally inadequate EIR, inadequate findings of fact and statement of overriding
26 considerations, and violations of the California Planning and Zoning Law.

27

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

25. The Project is located on 270 acres of land in the City of Temecula with a development
2 footprint of approximately 200 acres. The Project area is roughly bounded by the Santa Rosa Plateau
3 and Temecula Escarpment to the west, the Santa Margarita Ecological Reserve ("SMER") and the Santa

4 Margarita River to the south, the Palomar Mountains to the southeast, and development in Temecula

5 Valley to the north and east.

6 26. The Project location is biologically sensitive area, which is home to special status
7 species, including, but not limited to, the western pond turtle, San Diego ambrosia, paniculate tarplant,

8 burrowing owl, California gnatcatcher, yellow warbler, Cooper's hawk, northern harrier, white-tailed
9 kite, and California horned lark, California red-legged frog, mountain yellow-legged frog, and arroyo
10 toad, among other species. The Project area also contains wildlife corridors of regional significance for

11 mountain lions and other wildlife.

12 27. The Project footprint is within Criteria Cells (also referred to as "Cell Criteria") of the
13 MSHCP. Criteria Cells describe areas where MSHCP conservation will be focused, and compliance
14 with the MSHCP reserve assembly is required if a project is located within Criteria Cells. The Project
15 also is located at the confluence of the MSHCP's Proposed Constrained Linkage 13 along Murrieta
16 Creek, Proposed Linkage 10 between the foothills of the Santa Ana Mountains, and Proposed
17 Constrained Linkage 14 along Temecula Creek and the Santa Margarita River. A "Constrained
18 Linkage" is defined in the MSHCP as a "constricted connection expected to provide for movement of
19 identified Planning Species between Core Areas, where options for assembly of the connection are
20 limited due to existing patterns of use.'

21 The Western Riverside County Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan

22 28. The MSHCP is a comprehensive, multi-jurisdictional Habitat Conservation Plan for
23 Western Riverside County which was approved pursuant to the Federal Endangered Species Act (16
24 U.S.C. § 1539) and a Natural Communities Conservation Plan ("NCCP") under the State NCCP Act.
25 (Fish & Game Code §§ 2800-2835.) The MSHCP is intended to provide a coordinated Conservation
26 Area and implementation program to preserve biological diversity in Western Riverside County.
27

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 29. Under the MSHCP, the Wildlife Agencies authorize public and private development to
2 legally "take" or "harm" covered species or their habitat outside of the MSHCP Conservation Area in

3 exchange for MSHCP permittees complying with the MSHCP. The MSHCP acknowledges the
4 obligation of local projects, both public and private, to mitigate their impacts on species.

5 30. The MSHCP describes a process to allow limited changes to the status of lands conserved
6 under the MSHCP. The "Criteria Refinement" process allows for lands to be taken out of conservation
7 if such activities result in the same or greater conservation value and acreage to the MSHCP
8 conservation area. The Criteria Refinement process requires MSHCP permittees to (a) demonstrate that
9 the refinement clearly benefits Covered Species and is consistent with MSHCP polices and species
10 conservation goals; (b) evaluate environmental review requirements, land use plan changes,

11 transportation planning considerations, consistency with other HCPs and other factors, depending upon
12 the scope of the Refinement; and (c) demonstrate consistency with the Reserve Assembly Accounting

13 process in section 6.7 of the MSHCP. Criteria Refinements much like an amendment to a General
14 Plan-are discretionary projects that require appropriate CEQA review.

15 31. The MSHCP describes a process for evaluating and accepting Criteria Refinements
16 which includes the preparation of Project Information and an Equivalency Analysis. The Project
17 Information must contain: (a) a description of the planning area for the project; (b) a narrative and
18 graphic description of the project; (c) a narrative and graphic description of bio logical information,
19 including vegetation mapping and species surveys; (d) a narrative and graphic description of the
20 project's efforts to be consistent with the MSHCP Criteria and an explanation as to why consistency is
21 infeasible; and a (e) a quantification and characterization of the effects/benefits of the proposed project
22 with the proposed Criteria Refinement on habitats, species, and overall MSHCP Conservation Area
23 design and function.

24 32. The Equivalency Analysis must address the effects of the project on: (a) Habitats; (b)
25 Covered Species; (c) Core Areas; (d) Linkages and Constrained Linkages; (e) Non-Contiguous Habitat
26 blocks; (f) MSHCP Conservation Area configuration and management; and (g) Ecotones and other
27

28
7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

P conditions affecting species diversity. The Equivalency Analysis must also demonstrate that equivalent
2 or greater acreage will be contributed to the MSHCP Conservation Area, among other items.

3 33. If a project is determined to be "biologically equivalent or superior," then no amendment

4 to the MSHCP is required; if the project is not determined to be "bio logically equivalent or superior,"
5 then the project is an "unacceptable deviation" from the MSHCP such that an amendment to the
6 MSHCP is required. Amendments or modifications to the MSHCP are "not anticipated on a regular
7 basis" and require compliance with extensive procedures set forth in section 6.10 of the MSHCP.

g 34. Criteria Refinements also require notification of the Wildlife Agencies and must be
9 noticed agenda items of the Western Riverside County Regional Conservation Authority ("RCA").
10 Moreover, Criteria Refinements proposing conservation outside of the Criteria Arca to meet equivalency
11 findings are subject to approval or "concurrence" by the Wildlife Agencies.
12 35. In 2004, the City agreed to be a permittee of the MSHCP and executed the MSHCP
13 Implementing Agreement. In 2005, the City amended its General Plan and incorporated MSHCP
14 policies into the General Plan.
15 Petitioners' Comments on the Draft EIR

16 36. On or about November 13, 2014, the City issued a Notice of Preparation for the Project,
17 in which it notified public agencies and interested individuals that, as a lead agency, it would be
18 preparing a Draft EIR to analyze the Project's potentially significant environmental impacts.
19 37. In a letter to the City on April 15, 2015 (the "April 15 Letter"), the Wildlife Agencies
20 concurred with the determination of the RCA that the Project was inconsistent with the MSHCP. The

21 April 15 Letter noted that the Wildlife Agencies had already informed Ambient on March 20, 2014 and
22 August 21, 2014 that the Project was inconsistent with the MSHCP and that a Criteria Refinement
23 would be needed if the Project was to proceed as proposed. The April 15 Letter explained that
24 Ambient's MSHCP Consistency Report did not properly account for the presence of existing
25 development or the impact of the Project footprint on acreage goals for each Criteria Cell and subunit in
26 the MSHCP. The Wildlife Agencies further noted in the April 15 Letter that the Project would limit the
27 viability of the wildlife corridors for mountain lions and other species on Proposed Constrained Linkage
28
8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

13, Proposed Linkage 10, and Proposed Constrained Linkage 14. The April 15 Letter also stated that

2 Ambient's MSHCP Consistency Report did not address impacts to western pond turtle nesting habitat or
3 San Diego ambrosia.
4 38. On or about May 2, 2016, Respondents completed the Draft EIR and circulated the
5 document for public comment.

6 39. Members of the public submitted comments pointing out the serious deficiencies in the
7 Draft EIR. Commenters, including Petitioners, explained the Project would further threaten the Santa
8 Ana mountain lions, significantly worsen air quality, traffic, public health and hydrologic conditions,
9 and that it would have severe impacts on endangered and threatened biological resources, and the
10 region's ability to meet its climate change goals. Commenters noted that the Draft EIR failed to

11 adequately disclose or analyze the Project's significant air quality and climate change impacts, and
12 failed to establish an accurate baseline for determining such impacts; failed to identify or consider
13 adequate measures to mitigate the Project's significant impacts on air quality and public health,
14 including cumulative impacts; failed to identify or consider adequate measures to mitigate the Project's
15 significant impacts related to climate change; and failed to adequately analyze a reasonable range of
16 alternatives that would substantially lessen the Project's significant environmental effects.
17 40. In a letter to the City on June 17, 2016, the Club submitted comments explaining that the
18 Project was inconsistent with the MSHCP and informing the City that development on the southern
19 portion of the Project would constrain the last viable wildlife corridor for the Santa Ana mountain lions.

20 41. In a letter to the City on June 17, 2016, the Foundation-along with a coalition of other
21 organizations, including the Humane Society of the United States, the Cougar Fund, the Wildlife
22| Research Institute, the Fund for Animals, the Cougar Rewilding Foundation, the Cleveland National
23 Forest Foundation, Predator Defense, Laguna Greenbelt, WildFutures, Ojai Raptor Center, Western
24 Alliance for Nature, Los Angeles Audubon, San Joaquin Audubon, Animal Rescue Team, Ballona
25 Wetlands Trust, Russian Riverkeeper, Palo Verdes/South Bay Audubon Society, Action for Animals,
26 Eastern Sierra Wildlife Care, Wildlife Rescue, Native Animal Rescue, among other groups-jointly
27 submitted comments that:

28
9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

a. The Draft EIR uses outdated models to evaluate impacts on mountain lions.

2 b. The Project--combined with separately planned development on the eastern side of I-15
3 along an existing golf course-will severely constrain the natural corridor used by the
v Santa Ana mountain lions and replace it with urban development, potentially leading to
5 the complete die-off of the population.
6 42. In a letter to the City on June 17, 2016, the Wildlife Agencies restated many of the issues

7 outlined in the April 15 Letter. In addition, the Wildlife Agencies informed the City that:

8 a. The MSHCP implementation and the Project's impacts on MSHCP reserve assembly is
9 both incorrect and misleading to the public, and that a Criteria Refinement would be
10 necessary unless the Project is substantially altered to comply with the MSHCP.
11 b. The MSHCP Consistency Report and EIR take the sub-unit acreage concept and apply
12 it incorrectly to an analysis of the Project's consistency with the MSHCP. In addition,
13 the EIR improperly assumes that any undeveloped acre in a Criteria Cell within the
14 sub-unit could be conserved regardless of whether or not the area is described in the
15 MSHCP for conservation.

16 C. The Draft EIR fails to contain adequate detail-such as success criteria, standards, or
17 techniques--regarding Ambient's plans to translocate the San Diego ambrosia
18 population existing on the Project site.

19 d. The Draft EIR fails to contain any assessment of habitat loss for the western pond

20 turtle, or analysis of potential project impacts on the western pond turtle.

21 e. There are ten special status species that (a) have a moderate or greater potential to occur
22 within the Project area and (b) are not covered by the MSHCP, such that the City
23 should revise and recirculate the Draft EIR after conducting site-specific surveys and
24 include detailed analysis on potential project impacts as well as feasible and

25 enforceable avoidance, minimization, and/or mitigation measures to reduce the
26 potential impacts to them.

27

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

f. The Santa Ana mountain lions already suffer from low genetic diversity and
2 maintaining movement between the Santa Ana and Peninsular Ranges is critical to the
3 viability of the Santa Ana mountain lions. Increased human activity associated with
+ 4n 0 development on the South Parcel would permanently impair not only Proposed Linkage
10 as movement and live-in-habitat for mountain lions and other wildlife, but also be
detrimental to facilitating the movement of mountain lions across I-15 to the Peninsular
~J Ranges. The Project would result in irreversible significant permanent damage to the
8 MSHCP and to the Santa Ana mountain lions.

9 43. In a letter to the City on November 30, 2016 (the "November 30 Letter"), the Center, the
10 Club, and Cougar Connection jointly commented that the Draft EIR failed to comply with CEQA and
11 other laws and policies in the following respects:
12 a. The Draft's EIR's description of the Project is vague and incomplete, resulting in a
13 failure to analyze and/or mitigate the full range of significant impacts from the Project.
14 b. The Project is inconsistent with various General Plan policies and the Air Quality
15 Management Plan.
16 C. The Draft EIR fails to adequately disclose and/or analyze the Project's significant
17 impacts on aesthetics.
18 d. The Draft EIR fails to adequately disclose and/or analyze the Project's significant

19 impacts on air quality, public health, and sensitive populations. The Draft EIR fails to
20 establish an accurate baseline for determining the Project's air quality and public health
21 impacts, and fails to identify or consider adequate measures to mitigate such impacts.
22 The Draft EIR's proposed mitigation measures to reduce air quality impacts are vague,
23 deferred, and/or unenforceable.

24 e. The Draft EIR fails to adequately disclose and/or analyze the Project's significant
25 impacts on biological resources, including endangered, threatened, and other special
26 status species such as the western pond turtle, San Diego ambrosia, paniculate tarplant,
27 burrowing owl, California gnatcatcher, yellow warbler, Cooper's hawk, northern harrier,
28

white-tailed kite, and California horned lark, California red-legged frog, mountain

2 yellow-legged frog, and arroyo toad, and fails to identify or consider adequate measures
3 to mitigate the Project's significant impacts on such species.
4 f. The Draft EIR fails to adequately disclose and/or analyze the Project's significant
impacts on the Santa Ana mountain lions, and fails to identify or consider adequate

6 measures or alternatives to mitigate the Project's significant impacts on this population.
7 g. The City and/or Ambient did not prepare a Determination of Biological Equivalent or
8 Superior Preservation for impacts on riparian habitat, as required by the MSHCP.
h. The Draft EIR fails to establish consistency with the MSHCP because, inter alia, the
- Project would preclude Cell Criteria goals for various MSHCP Criteria Cells, interfere
11 with the functionality of Proposed Linkage 10, degrade biological connectivity between
12 Proposed Linkage 10 and Constrained Linkage 14, and preclude MSHCP reserve
13 assembly goals.

14 •F The Draft EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze or mitigate the Project's significant
15 impacts related to GHGs. The Draft EIR fails to establish an accurate and factually-
16 supported baseline and threshold of significance for determining the Project's GHG
17 impacts. The Draft EIR fails to properly analyze the Project's potential to undermine the
18 State's climate goals.

19 •- The Draft EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze or mitigate the significant impacts of
20 the Project's fuel modification plans.

21 k. The Draft EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze or mitigate the Project's significant
22 impacts related to water quality and water supplies.

23 l. The Draft EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze or mitigate the Project's significant

n. The Draft EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze or mitigate the Project's significant

2 cumulative impacts, including cumulative impacts to biological resources, air quality,
3 GHG emissions, water quality, water supplies, and traffic.

4 44. On February 14, 2017, the City Council conducted a public hearing arising from a request

5 from City staff for direction from the City Council on future uses and/or activities on the 55-acre South
6 Parcel of the Altair Project. During the hearing, Petitioners presented oral comments requesting that the

7 City designate the South Parcel as open space in order to reduce impacts on the Santa Ana mountain
8  lions. The Wildlife Agencies submitted a letter earlier in the day on February 14, 2017 explaining that
9 the South Parcel---which is at the confluence of two linkages-is a "poor site for an interpretive center"
10  and that wildlife corridors are not an appropriate place for a trail system with associated human
11 presence. The Wildlife Agencies again stated that development of the South Parcel would interfere with
12 the functionality of two MSHCP wildlife corridors whose width and distance from human activity are
13 critical for the mountain lion population in the Santa Ana Mountains.

14 45. Nonetheless, the City Council announced during the February 14, 2017 public hearing
15 that it intended to designate the South Parcel for development as part of the Project as an "interpretive
16 center" with the option to develop the South Parcel with a more intensive use a such as a hospital, college,
17 or other civic use in the event that a lawsuit was filed against the Project.

18 Petitioners' Comments on the Final EIR

19 46. On or about November 3, 2017, the City released its Final EIR, which included text
20 changes to the Draft EIR and Respondents' responses to public comments on the Draft EIR. The City

21 asserted in staff materials that it had prepared a "Technical Memo" that responded to issues raised in the
22 November 30 Letter, but such a memo was not released to the public or seen by Petitioners. The City's
23 failure to disclose or analyze the Project's impacts, as summarized above and explained in comments
24 from Petitioners and other commenters, persisted in the Final EIR. Furthermore, the Final EIR failed to
25  address the vast majority of the issues raised by the Wildlife Agencies, including the failure of the Final
26 EIR to establish consistency with the MSHCP.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

47. On November 15, 2017, the City's Planning Commission conducted a public hearing on
2 the Project. During the hearing, Petitioners presented additional oral comments on the deficiencies of
3 the Project and the Final EIR. The City's Planning Commission nonetheless recommended that the City
4 Council approve of the Project.

5 48. In a letter on December 2, 2017, the Center, the Club, and Cougar Connection further
6 explained the ongoing deficiencies of the Final EIR, commenting that the Final EIR and associated
7 | project approval documents failed to comply with CEQA and other laws and policies in the following
8 respects:

9 a. The Final EIR's responses to comments fail to include good faith and reasoned analysis
10 in response to comments by Petitioners, the Wildlife Agencies, and independent

11 mountain lion experts, among other stakeholders.

12 b. The Final EIR's description of the Project is vague and incomplete, resulting in a failure
13 to analyze and/or mitigate the full range of significant impacts from the Project.
14 C. The Final EIR fails to adequately disclose and/or analyze the Project's significant impacts
15 on the Santa Ana mountain lions or acknowledge the importance of the I-15 corridor
16 crossing to the population, and fails to identify or consider adequate measures or
17 alternatives to mitigate the Project's significant impacts on this population.

18 d. The Final EIR misleadingly states that only a "nature center" is proposed for the South

19 Parcel even though the Final EIR elsewhere states that many other uses would be

20 permitted, and fails to analyze or mitigate the impacts of uses on the South Parcel.

21 e. The Final EIR fails to disclose or analyze the effects of human activity arising from the

22 Project on mountain lions and other wildlife, despite the strong evidence that human

23 activity affects wildlife behavior.

24 f. The Final EIR fails to disclose that the South Parcel is designated for development in part
25 SO that Ambient can dispose of hundreds of thousands of cubic yards of construction dirt

26 there, thereby avoiding the cost of transporting the dirt offsite.

14 on air quality, public health, and sensitive populations, particularly regarding the well-

15 n. documented public health risks of siting homes next to highways or frecways.

16 The Final EIR's alternatives analysis fails to consider a range of feasible alternatives and

17 provides insufficient comparative analysis of proffered alternatives. The Final EIR fails

18 to demonstrate that a smaller project is not feasible.
o. The Final EIR's Statement of Overriding Considerations is inadequate.
19| Respondents' Approval of the EIR

20 49. On November 29, 2017, representatives of Petitioners as well as other conservation
21 a groups had a meeting with the City's Mayor, Matt Rahn, as well as City Planning staff, a representative
22 of Ambient, and representatives of the Wildlife Agencies and the RCA. Petitioners along with the
23 Wildlife Agencies requested that the City delay approval of the Project for at least 30 days so that the
24 various stakeholders (a) would have adequate time to review and comment on any revised MSHCP
25 consistency analysis prior to Project approval and (b) work collaboratively with the City and Ambient
26 on resolving the problems with the Project. Mayor Rahn indicated that he would request such an
27

28
15
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

extension from the other Council Members during the upcoming December 12 meeting of the City
2 Council, but the representative from Ambient indicated that he would not support such an extension.
3 50. On the evening of Friday, December 8, 2017, the City posted the staff agenda materials
for the December 12, 2017 meeting of the City Council. The staff agenda materials included a letter

5 from the RCA dated December 7, 2017 (the "December 7 Letter"), which stated that the RCA had

6 previously found that the Project was inconsistent with the MSHCP, but that if 12 listed measures were
incorporated as conditions of approval for the Project, then the RCA would find the Project now
8 consistent with the MSHCP. Measure No. 1 in the December 7 Letter stated: "Final EIR, Chapter 2 will
o acknowledge the RCA and Wildlife Agencies' require that the method for determining MSHCP
10 consistency is at the individual Criteria Cell level pursuant to the MSHCP." Although the 12 listed
11 measures in the December 7 Letter include additional measures not contained in the Final EIR, the
12 December 7 Letter did not require the City or Ambient to fully comply with the Criteria Refinement
13 process.

14 51. In addition, on the evening of December 8, 2017, the City posted a short document
15 entitled "Addition to Final EIR." The City did not release a revised version of the Final EIR, nor did the
16 City indicate which portions if any.---of the Final EIR were superseded by the "Addition to the Final

17 EIR."

18 52. On December 12, 2017, Respondents conducted a public hearing on the proposed Project

19 and Final EIR to determine whether to certify the Final EIR. Members of the public, including
20 Petitioners, attended the public hearing and opposed the certification of the Final EIR and approval of
21 the Project as currently proposed. Petitioners again requested that the City designate the South Parcel as

22 open space so that it could function as a viable wildlife corridor. Petitioners and the Wildlife Agencies
23 also requested that the City delay approval of the Final EIR until the project approval documents were
24 revised to show consistency with the MSHCP and address other inadequacies with the Project.
25 53. In response to these requests, Mayor Rahn asked the other City Council Members to

26 agree to delay project approval for a short period of time in order to work collaboratively with the
27 Wildlife Agencies and environmental community in addressing the issues with the Project. Mayor Pro

F Tem Michael Naggar, Council Member Maryann Edwards, and Council Member Jeff Comerchero
2 refused Mayor Rahn's request. The City Council then approved the Project and certified the Final EIR
3 by a 4 to vote, with Council Member James Stewart voting against approval.

4 54. On December 12, 2017, Ambient's consultants at Helix Environmental Planning finalized
5 a "Functional Equivalency Analysis for the Western Bypass and Altair Specific Plan Amendment
6 Development Footprint and approximately 66 acres of land proposed for conservation on Assessor
7 Parcel Numbers 918-080-008 and 918-080-009 under the Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan

8 and Standards for an Additional 100 Acres" (the "FEA"). The FEA was not released to the public until

9 after the December 12 approval of the Project. The FEA contained many of the same analytical
10 shortcomings of the MSHCP analyses in the Final EIR.

11 55. On December 13, 2017, the City filed the "Notice of Determination" for the Project, even
12 though the Project had not yet undergone a second reading as required by California law.
13 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

14 Violation of CEQA - Inadequate EIR
15 (Public Resources Code § 21000, et seq.)
16 56. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above.

17 57. CEQA is designed to ensure that long-term protection of the environment be the guiding
18 criterion in public decisions. CEQA requires the lead agency for a project with the potential to cause a
19 significant environmental impacts to prepare an EIR that complies with the requirements of the statute,
20 including, but not limited to, the requirement to analyze the project's potentially significant

21 environmental impacts. The EIR must provide sufficient environmental analysis such that the
22 decisionmakers can intelligently consider environmental consequences when acting on the proposed
23 project. Such analysis must include and rely upon thresholds of significance that are based on
24 substantial evidence before the decisionmakers. Additionally, the EIR must analyze feasible mitigation
25 measures and a reasonable range of alternatives to the project.

26 58. CEQA also mandates that the lead agency adopt feasible and enforceable mitigation
27 measures that would reduce or avoid any of a project's significant environmental impacts. If any of the
28
17
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F project's significant impacts cannot be mitigated to a less than significant level, then CEQA bars the

2 lead agency from approving project if a feasible alternative is available that would meet the project's
3 objectives while avoiding or reducing its significant environmental impacts.

59. CEQA requires that substantial evidence in the administrative record support all of the

5 EIR and agency's findings and conclusions, and that the agency explain how the evidence in the record

6 supports the conclusions the agency has reached.

7 60. Respondents committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in a
8 manner required by law by relying on an EIR that fails to meet the requirements of CEQA for
9 disclosure, analysis, and/or mitigation of significant project impacts on biological resources, air quality,
10 GHGs, water supplies, water quality, traffic, aesthetics, noise, and applicable land use policies including
11 the MSHCP.

12 61. MSHCP Consistency. The EIR fails to analyze, disclose, or mitigate the significant
13 impacts associated with the Project's inconsistency with the MSHCP, the MSHCP Implementing
14| Agreement, the MSHCP Natural Community Conservation Plan permit, and the MSHCP Incidental
15 Take Permit. The Project violates CEQA due to these inconsistencies with the MSHCP because, inter
16 alia:

17 a. The EIR fails to establish that the Project complies with the MSHCP Criteria Refinement
18 procedures, including, but not limited to, (1) preparation of an Equivalency Analysis, (2)
19 noticing the Refinement as an agenda item before the RCA; (3) demonstrating
20 concurrence by the Wildlife Agencies, and (4) demonstrating that the Refinement has
21 undergone appropriate CEQA review.
22 b. The EIR fails to establish that the City and/or Ambient prepared an adequate
23 Determination of Bio logical Equivalent or Superior Preservation for impacts on riparian
24 habitat;

25 C. The EIR's MSHCP Consistency Report incorrectly calculates the shortfall of MSHCP
26 acreage for the Project, including by assuming that any undeveloped acreage in a Criteria
27

28
18
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Cell within the sub-unit could be conserved regardless of whether or not the area was

2 described for conservation.

3 d. The EIR fails to address that (1) the MSHCP does not envision development on the South
t Parcel; (2) wildlife corridors including the MSHCP's Proposed Constrained Linkage 13,
Proposed Linkage 10, and Constrained Linkage 14 are not appropriate sites for
development; (3) the Project and associated increases in human activity would
7 permanently impair the functionality of these MSHCP linkages as mo vement and live-in

8 habitat for mountain lions and other wildlife.

9 62. Impacts on Mountain Lions. The EIR fails to analyze, disclose, and/or mitigate the
10 direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts of the Project on mountain lions, including the Santa Ana
11 mountain lion population. CEQA defines an impact as significant if the Project may substantially
12 reduce the habitat of a fish or wildlife species or threaten to eliminate a plant or animal community. The
13 Project would threaten to eliminate the Santa Ana population of mountain lions by substantially
14 degrading the wildlife corridors that are critical for the continued survival of the population.
15 63. Environmental Setting. The EIR fails to comply with CEQA's requirements to provide
16 an adequate and accurate description of the environmental setting of the Project area. (CEQA
17 Guidelines § 15125.) The EIR's description of the environmental setting is inadequate because, but not
18 limited to, its failure to:

19 a. adequately disclose the Project a area's importance as a habitat corridor and linkage for

20 mountain lions and other wildlife;

21 b. establish that protocol-level surveys were performed on all appropriate species; and,

22 C. disclose the results of all biological surveys conducted on the Project site.

23 64. Project Description. The EIR does not contain a legally adequate Project description
24 because, inter alia, the EIR claims a "nature center" is proposed for the South Parcel but elsewhere
25 provides that many other uses would be permitted.
26

27

28
19
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

65. Air Quality. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze and/or mitigate the Project's
2 significant and cumulative impacts to air quality. The EIR's analysis of air quality impacts is inadequate
3 because, but not limited to, its failure to:

4 a. disclose or analyze the impacts of the Project on sensitive populations;
b. disclose or analyze the impacts of siting homes immediately adjacent to a highway;

6 c. adopt all feasible mitigation measures and consider alternatives that would reduce

7 impacts.

8 66. Greenhouse Gases. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze and/or mitigate the

9 Project's significant and cumulative GHG impacts. The EIR relies upon an improper significance
10 threshold when determining the significance of the Project's GHG emissions. In addition, the EIR's
11 GHG mitigation measures are vague, deferred, and/or unenforceable, and fail to set forth specific

12 numerical reductions in GHG emissions these measures will achieve.

13 67. Biological Resources. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze and/or mitigate the
14 Project's significant and cumulative impacts to biological resources, including numerous animal and
15 plant species affected by the Project. Those species include, but are not limited to, the western pond
16 turtle, San Diego ambrosia, paniculate tarplant, burrowing owl, California gnatcatcher, yellow warbler,
17 Cooper's hawk, northern harrier, white-tailed kite, and California horned lark, California red-legged
18 frog, mountain yellow-legged frog, and arroyo toad. The EIR's biological resources analysis is
19 inadequate because, inter alia the EIR's mitigation measures are vague, deferred, and/or unenforceable;

20 68. Traffic. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze and/or mitigate the Project's

21 significant and cumulative traffic impacts.

22 69. Water Supplies. The EIR does not adequately disclose, analyze and/or mitigate the
23 Project's significant impacts to water supplies.

24 70. Aesthetics. The EIR does not adequately disclose, analyze and/or mitigate the Project's
25 significant impacts to aesthetics.

26 71. Alternatives. The EIR fails to provide a selection and discussion of alternatives that
27 foster informed decision-making and informed public participation. The alternatives analysis in the EIR

28
20
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

does not meet the requirement of a reasonable range of alternatives that lessen the Project's significant
2 environmental impacts, and does not focus on alternatives that either eliminate adverse impacts or

3 reduce them to insignificance, even if they would to some degree impede the Project's objectives, as

4 required by CEQA.

5 72. Responses to Comments. The responses to comments in the Final EIR fail to meet
6 CEQA's requirements in that they neither adequately dispose of all the issues raised, nor provide

7 specific rationale for rejecting suggested Project changes, mitigation measures, or alternatives. CEQA
8 requires that the lead agency evaluate and respond to all environmental comments on the Draft EIR that

9 it receives during the public review period. The responses must describe the disposition of the issues
10 raised and must specifically explain reasons for rejecting suggestions and for proceeding without
11 incorporating the suggestions. The Final EIR's responses to comments fail to satisfy the requirements of
12 law.

13 73. Public Participation. The EIR and accompanying Development Agreement are
14 designed to frustrate public participation in the CEQA process by allowing more intensive development
15 on the South Parcel "if a legal action or actions (based on CEQA or otherwise) is filed against all or any
16 | portion of the Project," thereby retaliating against any group that files suit to challenge the legal
17 inadequacies of the project approvals. Such provisions also violate CEQA because they are contrary to
18 California public policy and amount to an impermissible impairment on the right of access to the courts.

19 74. The EIR fails to reflect the independent judgment of Respondents.

20 75. Based upon each of the foregoing reasons, the EIR is legally defective under CEQA.
21 Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion in violation of CEQA in approving the Project. As
22 such, the Court should issue a writ of mandate directing Respondents to set aside the certification of the
23 EIR and approval of the Project.

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

2 Violation of CEQA - Inadequate Statement of Overriding Considerations and Findings

3 (Public Resources Code § 21000, et seq.)

4 76. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above.

5 77. Respondents' Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations violate the
6 requirements of the CEQA Guidelines. The Findings fail to identify the changes or alterations that are

7 required to avoid or substantially lessen the project's significant environmental effects. (CEQA
8 Guidelines § 15091(a)(1). The purported benefits of the Project cited in the Statement of Overriding
9 Considerations do not outweigh the substantial costs of the Project on public health and the
10 environment. The Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations are not supported by substantial
11  evidence. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15091(b).)

12 78. Where mitigation measures and alternatives to a project are not adopted, the CEQA
13 findings must identify specific economic, legal, social and technological and other considerations that

14 make infeasible the adoption of mitigation measures or alternatives. All CEQA findings must be
15 supported by substantial evidence in the record and must disclose the analytical route by which approval
16 of the Project is justified. The findings regarding the impacts, mitigation measures, and alternatives
17 relied upon by Respondents' approval of the Project are not supported by substantial evidence in the
18 record, and the links between evidence and conclusions are not satisfactorily provided.

19 79. Respondents' Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations fail to reflect
20 the independent judgment of Respondents.

21 80. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents did not proceed in the manner required
22 by law, and their decision to approve the Project was not supported by substantial evidence.
23 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

24 Violation of CEQA - Failure to Recirculate EIR

25 (Public Resources Code § 21000, et seq.)

26 81. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above..

27

28 22
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

82. CEQA requires that if significant new information is added to an EIR after a draft EIR is

2 prepared, but before certification of the final EIR, an amended EIR must be amended and recirculated

3 for public review and comment.

4 83. The December 7 Letter and the "Addition to Final EIR," among other items, amount to
5 substantial changes to the Project which added significant new information to the EIR prior to the City's

6 December 12, 2017 decision to certify the EIR as compliant with CEQA. .

7 84. Despite the changes, Respondents failed to recirculate the EIR or any portion of the EIR
8 as required CEQA, nor did Respondents update the text of the Final EIR to reflect the proposed changes
9 in the December 7 Letter or the "Addition to Final EIR." As a result of Respondents' failure to
10 recirculate the EIR, the public and other public agencies were deprived of any meaningful opportunity to
11 review and comment on the approved Project, its substantial adverse environmental consequences, and
12 the new information regarding other unanalyzed environmental effects of the Project.
13 85. By failing to amend and recirculate the EIR, Respondents failed to proceed in the manner
14 required by law, and their decision to approve the Project was not supported by substantial evidence.
15 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

16 Violation of California Planning and Zoning Law

17 (Government Code § 65300, et seq.) §

18 86. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above.
19 87. The California Planning and Zoning Law provides that the City's General Plan is a

20 fundamental land use planning document and serves as the constitution for future development within
21 the City. Land use actions, including the approvals associated with the Project, must be consistent with

22 the General Plan.

23 88. The Project is inconsistent with numerous mandatory General Plan policies, including,

24 but not limited to, (a) policies within the Community Design Element, including Policies 5.1, 5.2, and
25 5.3; (b) policies within the Open Space/Conservation Element, including Policies 3.2, 3.3, and 3.7; (c)
26 policies within the Land Use Element, including Policy 6.3; (d) policies and programs incorporating the

27

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

MSHCP into to the General Plan, including, but not limited to, Implementation Programs OS-9 and OS-
2 35.

89. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents did not proceed in the manner required

4 by law, and their decision to approve the Project was not supported by substantial evidence.
WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as follows:

6 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

l. For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent

8 injunctions restraining Respondents and Ambient and their agents, servants, and employees, and all

9 others acting in concert with them or on their behalf, from taking any action to implement, fund or
10 construct any portion or aspect of the Project, pending full compliance with the requirements of CEQA,
11 the CEQA Guidelines, the MSHCP, and the California Planning and Zoning Law;

12 2. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to vacate and set
13 aside certification of the EIR and approval documents for the Project;

14 3. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to comply with
15 CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, the MSHCP, and the California Planning and Zoning Law, and take any
16 other action as required by Public Resources Code section 21168.9;

17 4. For a declaration that Respondents' actions in certifying the EIR and approving the
18 Project violated CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, the MSHCP, and the California Planning and Zoning

19 Law, and that the certification and all project approvals are invalid and of no force or effect;

20 5. For costs of the suit;

Re: Notice of Commencement of Legal Action Alleging Environmental Harm

Dear Office of Attorney General:
The enclosed Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate, Center for Biological Diversity et al. V. City of Temecula et al., is submitted to your office pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
388 and Public Resources Code section 21167.7. This case is being pursued under the private
attorney general provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5
The case is being brought by the Center for Biological Diversity, Sicrra Club, Mountain Lion Foundation and the Cougar Connection challenging the City of Temecula's approval of the Altair Specific Plan (the "Project"). The Project would be built in a biologically sensitive area within the City of Temecula. The Project will threaten wildlife habitat, including corridors relied upon by Santa Ana mountain lions, worsen air pollution, frustrate California's climate change goals, and induce growth that would lead to further gridlock, pollution and habitat fragmentation.
The Center for Biological Diversity, Sierra Club, Mountain Lion Foundation and the Cougar Connection allege environmental harm that could affect the public generally and the
natural resources of the state.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
pLh-
John Rose
Staff Attorney
Center for Biological Diversity
