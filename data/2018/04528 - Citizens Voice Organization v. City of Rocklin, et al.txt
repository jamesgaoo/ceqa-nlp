27 29. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 28,
28 inclusive, of this Petition, as if fully set forth below.
6 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

t 30. Respondents committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in
Nm tnON manner required by law by relying on an EIR that fails to meet the requirements of CEQA for
disclosure, analysis, and/or mitigation of significant project impacts.
31. Respondents' Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations violate
the requirements of the CEQA Guidelines. The Findings of Fact and Statement of Overridin'g
Considerations are not supported by substantial evidence. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15091(b).)
32. The EIR fails to comply with the requirements of CEQA in that it fails to
co adequately disclose, analyze and/or mitigate the Project's environmental impacts and cumulative

9 impacts as required by law, and its conclusions regarding the Project's environmental impacts

10 are not supported by substantial evidence.

11 a. The EIR fails to adequately address, analyze and mitigate the Project's

12 impacts to traffic.

13 b. The EIR fails to adequately address, analyze and mitigate the Project's
14 impacts to schools and school facilities.

15 C. The EIR fails to adequately address, analyze and mitigate the Project's

16 cumulative impacts to traffic. For example, the EIR lacks an adequate analysis of traffic

17 relating to transfer of students between schools. Additionally, the EIR's cumulative impact

18 discussion regarding traffic fails to include a number of past, present and reasonably foreseeable

19 projects that result in significant more vehicle trips than disclosed in the EIR.

20 d. The EIR fails to adequately address, analyze and mitigate the Project's

21 impacts to biological resources. For example, the EIR lacks substantial evidence to support its

22 conclusion that identified mitigation measures will actually mitigate the Project's significant

23 impact to native oak trees. The EIR fails to demonstrate how the City's tree preservation

24 ordinance that permits removal of native oak trees adequately mitigates for the significant

25 impact to this unique resource.

26 e. The EIR fails to adequately address, analyze and mitigate the Project's

27 impacts to aesthetics.

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

I 33. The BIR fails to provide a selection and discussion of alternatives that fosters

2 informed decision-making and informed public participation. The alternatives analysis in the
a0 DW EIR does not meet the requirement of a reasonable range of alternatives that lessen the Project's
significant environmental impacts, and does not focus on alternatives that either eliminate
adverse impacts or reduce them to insignificance, even if they would to some degree if impede the
Project's objectives, as required by CEQA.

34. The EIR failed to include feasible alternatives to the Project that were presented to
c0 the City. Such alternatives include a land swap proposal with Sierra College.

9 35. Based upon each of the foregoing reasons, the EIR is legally defective under

10 CEQA. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion in violation of CEQA in approving

11 the Project. As such, the Court should issue a writ of mandate directing Respondents to set

12 aside the certification of the EIR and approval of the Project.

13 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

14 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as follows:

15 1. That this Court issue a peremptory writ of mandate ordering Respondent to:

16 a. vacate and set aside Resolution No. 2017-276 of the City Council of the

17 City of Rocklin Certifying a Final Environmental Impact Report, Making Findings of Fact and

18 Statement of Overriding Considerations and Approving a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting

19 Program (Sierra Gateway Apartments / DR2015-0018 and TRE2016-0001);

20 b. vacate and set aside Resolution No. 2017-277 of the City of Council of the

21 City of Rocklin Approving a Design Review and an Oak Tree Preservation Plan Permit (Sierra

22 College Apartments (DR2015-0018 and TRE2016-0001)

23 C. suspend approval of any and all contracts for construction of the Project
24 3 until the Respondents are in compliance with CEQA;
d. suspend all activity that could result in any change or alteration to the
26 physical environment until Respondents have taken such actions as may be necessary to bring

27 their determination, findings or decision regarding the Project into compliance with CEQA;

28 2. For Petitioner's costs associated with this action;

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
