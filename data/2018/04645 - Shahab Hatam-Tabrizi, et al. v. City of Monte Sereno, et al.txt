1 Petitioners allege:

2 1. Petitioners SHAHAB HATAM-TABRIZI and ELHAM HATAM-TABRIZI
("Petitioners") are married individuals who are residents of the County of
Santa Clara, State of California.

5 2. Petitioners are parties beneficially interested within the meaning of Code

6 of Civil Procedure §1085 because they bring this action to enforce the

7 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code
§21000, et. seq-, as:
8 a. Owners of a one (1) acre lot directly bordering and adjacent to the
9 four and one half (4.5) acre lot that is the subject of the Project
10 hereafter alleged, and
11 b. As private attorneys general for the benefit of the general public.

12 3. Respondent CITY OF MONTE SERENO ("City") is a municipal

13 corporation that is situated in, and is a subdivision of, the State of

14 California. Respondent CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF MONTE

15 SERENO ("City Council") is the governing board of said City. Both the

16 City and the City Council are inferior to this Court within the meaning of
Code of Civil Procedure §1085.
17
4. Real Parties in Interest RUSSELL W. STANLEY, HACIENDA REALTY,
18 LLC, and THE STANLEY GROUP, INC. are the applicants before the
19 City and the City Council for approval of the Project hereafter alleged.
20 5. The true names and capacities of Real Parties in Interest DOES ONE
21 through FIFTY are unknown to Petitioners, who therefore sue them by
22 such fictitious names. Petitioners will seek leave to amend this Petition to
23 state their true names and capacities when ascertained. Petitioners are

24 informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that each such DOE has, or

25 will, join with the truly-named Real Parties in Interest and Respondents

26 in the implementation of the unlawful course of conduct hereafter alleged.
6. On June 12, 2018, by a vote of three to two (3 to 2), the City Council
27 approved a Mitigated Negative Declaration for the above-alleged Project,
28 2
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE, STAY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF TO REMEDY CEQA
VIOLATION

which is known as the Montalvo Oaks/Hacienda Housing Development
2 Project ("Project"), finding that the Project as initially submitted by Real

3 Parties in Interest would have had potential significant effects (i.e.

4 substantial adverse changes) on the environment, but that subsequent

5 changes or mitigation measures for the Project adopted by Real Parties in

6 Interest had reduced these effects to a level of insignificance.

7 7. The Project consists of a General Plan Amendment, Planned Development
Pre-Zoning Ordinance, Annexation approval, Vesting Tentative
8 Subdivision Map, Planned Development Permit, Grading Use Permit, and
9 Tree Removal Permit ("Project Elements") for the above-alleged 4.5+acre
10 lot located at 18840 Saratoga-Los Gatos Road, which, as alleged above,
11 directly borders on and is adjacent to a one (1) acre lot owned by
12 Petitioners, on which they intend to build their "dream home" in the near

13 future.

14 8. Immediately after approving the Mitigated Negative Declaration, and

15 again by a vote of three to two (3 to 2), the City Council approved the

16 foregoing General Plan Amendment, Annexation, Tentative Subdivision
Map and Planned Development.
17 9. The next day, on June 13, 2018, the City filed with the Santa Clara
18 County Clerk-Recorder, a Notice of Determination for the Project and the
19 Mitigated Negative Declaration, finding that the Project would not have a

20 significant effect on the environment.

21 10. On June 19, 2018, one week after the foregoing initial meeting, the City

22 Council met again, held a second reading of the foregoing Pre-Zoning

23 Ordinance, and thereupon adopted it, again by the same vote of three to

24 two (3 to 2).

25 11. The next day, on June 20, 2018, the City filed with the Santa Clara
County Clerk•Recorder, a Notice of Determination for the Pre-Zoning 26 portion of the Project and the Mitigated Negative Declaration, finding
27 that it would not have a significant effect on the environment.

H

U) 12. In approving the Mitigated Negative Declaration and finding that the

cn Project's initial potential significant effects on the environment had been
reduced to a level of insignificance by the subsequent adoption of
mitigation measures, the City Council:

a.

6

7 Erred factually because, despite the mitigation measures, the

8 Project may have significant effects on the environment, and

9 b. Erred legally because the potential significant effects on the
environment compelled preparation of an Environmental Impact
Report on the Project.

10

11

12 13. The Project may have the following significant effects on the environment:
a. Landslides, from bulldozer cuts up to 10 feet in height into a

13 hillside of sandy, alluvial soil. Such landslides may migrate to

14 Petitioners adjacent property to deposit large volumes of earth
it and induce landslides upon it. There has been no geological upon

15 effect.

16 report prepared by a qualified geologist on this potential significant

17

18 b. Destruction of sixty-six (66) trees on the Project site. There are one

19 hundred and thirty eight (138) trees located on the Project

20 property. There are seventeen (17) trees located directly adjacent to

21 the Project property that the City acknowledges could be impacted

22 due to Project construction. Monte Sereno has a Tree Preservation

8 Ordinance which defines the removal of any three (3) trees from
any parcel of property within a twelve (12) month period as

24 significant. This Ordinance states that it is adopted for the

25 purposes, among others, of prevention of soil erosion and landslides.

26 14.Had the City Council, instead, acknowledged these potential significant

27 effects and complied with its resulting legal duty to prepare an

28 Environmental Impact Report, that report would have been required to
include, among other things, presentation and analysis of a range of
reasonable alternatives to the Project as proposed to avoid or reduce the

4
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE, STAY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF TO REMEDY CEQA
VIOLATION

foregoing significant effects. Presumably, this would have included an
alternative completely eliminating the nine (9) houses (of the Project's
present thirty-six (36)) whose construction requires the bulldozer cut into

Un the hillside and tree destruction alleged above.

a 15. Petitioners are excused from any requirement to have exhausted their

7 administrative remedies by requesting the preparation of an
Environmental Impact Report because:

8

9 a. Such exhaustion would have been futile, in that Petitioners are

10 informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that the City

11 Council, in prior executive session(s), had already entered into an

12 agreement with Real Parties in Interest to settle pending litigation
against the City by Real Parties in Interest, under which that

13 litigation would be dismissed if the City Council approved the
Project.

14

15 b. The doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies violates the

16 right to petition the judicial branch of government for redress of

17 grievances as guaranteed by both Article 1, Section 3 (a) of the

18 Constitution of the State of California, and the First Amendment to
the Constitution of the United States.

19

20 16. Within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure §1085, the above-alleged
duty to prepare an Environmental Impact Report is one that the law

21 specially enjoins upon Respondents City and City Council as a duty

22 resulting from (a) the City's station as a public entity, and (b) the City

23 Council's office and trust as a body of elected officials

24 17. Petitioners have no plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary

25 course of law to cure Respondents' foregoing unlawful acts and omissions,

26 because equitable enforcement of the procedural and substantive

27 requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act is the only

28 means of providing to Petitioners and the public the benefit intended by

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE, STAY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF TO REMEDY CEQA
VIOLATION

1 the Legislature when it enacted the California Environmental Quality

2 Act.

3 18. Under Code Of Civil Procedure §1094.5, Petitioners are entitled to

4 issuance of a writ of administrative mandamus to compel performance of

5 the preparation of an Environmental Impact Report here, to the extent

6 that the City Council decisions to approve and adopt the Project Elements

7 alleged in Paragraph 7 were made as a result of a proceeding in which, by
law, a hearing was required to be given, evidence was required to be
taken, and discretion in the determination of facts was vested in the City
9 Council, because the City Council prejudicially abused its discretion, in
10 that:

11 a. By not preparing an Environmental Impact Report, it failed to

12 proceed in the manner required by law, and

13 b. Its finding that the Project will not have a significant effect on

14 the environment, is not supported by the evidence.

15 16. Alternatively, to the extent that Code Of Civil Procedure §1094.5 is

16 inapplicable in the circumstances, Petitioners are entitled to a writ of
mandate under Code of Civil Procedure §1085.
17 17. With the passage of time, mandamus may become a less-than-entirely
18 adequate remedy in this action, should Real Parties in Interest, including the
19 Does, attempt to commence construction of the Project, because only
20 injunctive relief will lie to restrain such activity by them.
21 18. Should such construction commence, it will (a) create great or irreparable
22 injury to Petitioners and the public by creating the significant effects on the
23 environment unlawfully ignored by Respondents, and (b) tend to render the

24 judgment sought herein ineffectual. Additionally, (a) pecuniary compensation

25 would not afford adequate relief to the Petitioners or public for the significant

26 effects on the environment caused by construction, or, alternatively, (b) the
amount of compensation which would afford adequate relief would be
27 extremely difficult to ascertain.

WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for relief against Respondents and Real
2 Parties in Interest as follows:

3 1. As appropriate, issuance of a writ of administrative mandamus

4 under Code Of Civil Procedure §1094.5 or a writ of mandate

5 under Code of Civil Procedure §1085, directing Respondent City

6 Council to rescind, void and annul its approvals of the Mitigated

7 Negative Declaration, General Plan Amendment, Planned
Development Pre-Zoning Ordinance, Annexation approval,
8 Vesting Tentative Subdivision Map, Planned Development
9 Permit, Grading Use Permit and Tree Removal Permit for the
10 Montalvo Oaks/Hacienda Housing Development Project, and to
11 prepare an Environmental Impact Report for the Project, and to
12 submit a return to the writ showing that it has done so, as well
13 as, upon subsequent application, if any, a stay of the

14 effectiveness of said approvals pending hearing and issuance of

15 the writ.

16 2. Upon subsequent ex parte application or noticed motion, as
appropriate, issuance against Real Parties in Interest, and each
17 of them, and their agents, servants, employees, and all persons
18 acting under, in concert with, or for them, as necessary, orders
19 to show cause, temporary restraining orders, preliminary
20 injunctions and permanent injunctions restraining and
21 enjoining them from undertaking site preparation, grading,

22 demolition or other operational activities pursuant to the

23 existing approvals and future approvals subsidiary to approval

24 of the Mitigated Negative Declaration, General Plan
