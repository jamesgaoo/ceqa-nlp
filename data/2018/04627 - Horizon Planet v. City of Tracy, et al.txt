23 INTRODUCTION

24 Petitioner, HORIZON PLANET ("Petitioner" or "Horizon") respectfully petitions this

25 Court for a Writ of Mandate pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, and

26 for a declaration of rights directed at the CITY OF TRACY ("City" or "Tracy"), by and through

27 the City Council, to decertify the Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") prepared and certified for

28 the Tracy Village Development Project, and to revoke the Tracy Village Specific Plan (SPA18-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE - I

1 0001), the Annexation and Pre-zoning of the Tracy Village Specific Plan site (A/P 13-0002), and

2 Tentative Subdivision Map (TSM17-0003) (collectively, the "Land Use Approvals" or "Project").

3 The Responses to Comments and Errata, Draft EIR, Draft EIR Appendices and Mitigation

4 Monitoring and Reporting Program together comprise the Final EIR that was reviewed and

5 considered by the City as part of the Project approval and are collectively referred to as the "EIR."
The City's actions violate state and local land use and environmental laws and amount to
a prejudicial abuse of discretion. A writ of mandate and preliminary and permanent injunctions

8 are necessary to remedy the City's failure to adequately address the Land Use Approvals

9 environmentai impacts, to ensure that the City complies with all applicable laws, and to ensure

10 proper review, disclosure, and mitigation of the potential environmental impacts resulting from

11 the approval and development of the Project pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act

12 ("CEQA"). By this Verified Petition, Petitioner represents the following:
PARTIES
13 I. Petitioner is, and at all times mentioned herein was, a California unincorporated
14 association. Petitioner's members include residents, voters, property owners, and taxpayers in and
15 around the City of Tracy. Petitioner's members are vitally and beneficially interested in the land
16 use decisions made by the City. Petitioner's members and representatives participated in Tracy's
17 public hearing process regarding the Land Use Approvals by submitting written comments
18 concerning the Project and on the EIR.

19 2. The City is, and at all times mentioned herein was, a general law city existing under

20 the laws of the State of California. The City has a duty under state law to comply with state law
21 requirements, including CEQA and State Planning and Zoning Law, when considering land use
22 requests.

23 3. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that Real Party in Interest

24 PONDEROSA HOMES II, INC. ("Ponderosa or "Real Party in Interest") is a California

25 corporation and that Ponderosa applied for and/or received the requested Land Use Approvals

26 from the City.

27 4. Petitioner does not know the true names or capacities, whether individual,

28 corporate, or otherwise, of those Respondents and Real Parties in Interest sued herein as DOES

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE - 2

1 through 40. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that said Respondents and
Real Parties in Interest are in some manner responsible for the adoption of, imposition of, or

3 administration of those laws, ordinances, and regulations of which Petitioner complains herein.

4 Petitioner will amend this Petition to set forth the true names and capacities of the fictitiously

5 named Respondents and Real Parties in Interest when such information has been ascertained.

6 5. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that each fictitiously named

7 Respondent and Real Party in Interest is responsible in some manner for the occurrences herein

8 alleged.

9 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

10 EIR AND LAND USE APPROVALS

6.
11 The proposed Project is currently located in San Joaquin County, and not in the

12 City of Tracy, thus requiring annexation by the City with the approval of the San Joaquin County

13 Local Agency Formation Commission ("LAFCO"). The EIR describes the Project as follows:
The Tracy Village Specific Plan area is located on approximately 135.2 acres in unincorporated
14 San Joaquin County. There are two components to the Tracy Village Specific Plan: zoning for
15 new development (the Tracy Village Development Plan-TVDP) and annexing and pre-zoning 42
16 existing residential lots (no development is proposed for these existing lots). The TVDP site is

17 currently vacant agricultural land. The private, gated TVDP is designed for up to 600 residential
18 lots and features a man-made lake system which would serve as the primary drainage conveyance,

19 a peak attenuation/storage facility and provide water quality treatment for urban storm waten
20 runoff.

21 7. Although the Project includes annexing a large expanse of acreage into the City

22 with implementation of major residential development over a multiple-year time period, the EIR
23 provides that no further environmental reviews for discretionary approvals are anticipated. All

24 other reviews are ministerial and will be performed at the administrative, non-discretionary level.

25 The Tracy Village Specific Plan provides all design and development standards for each pre-zoned

26 area.

27 8. In lieu of preparing a traditional "project EIR" - which must discuss all potentially

28 significant environmental effects from a project and presumes no further environmental review

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE - 3

1 will occur - CEQA Guidelines §15168 provides that a public agency may prepare a "program
2 EIR" for a series of related actions that are characterized as one large project or program. Activitiesi

3 which relate to and follow a specific plan that will be developed over many years and in many

4 phases may be examined at the program level based on information known about the
5 project/program at the time of review. Subsequent phases or activities in the project/program are

6 then reviewed in light of the program EIR to determine whether further environmental analysis is

7 warranted. Later activities which have been adequately analyzed under the program EIR will not

8 require additional environmental documentation. If an activity may result in additional effects, or

9 new mitigation measures are needed, a subsequent or supplemental EIR, or negative declaration

10 must be prepared pursuant to CEQA Guidelines §§15162 and 15163. Here, the City opted to

11 prepare both a program-level and project-level EIR.

9. However, the EIR does not include a detailed or thorough analysis of severall
12 potentially significant impacts resulting from the Project (as further alleged in this Petition), such
13 as impacts to the City's groundwater supplies and existing wells. The EIR also does not perform
14 a health risk assessment for Valley Fever air quality impacts (even though the EIR acknowledges
15 this deadly risk). Other significant impacts that were not adequately addressed, and conflict with
16 San Joaquin County's policies, include the conversion of agricultural and open space, air quality
17 and other health and safety concerns as expressed in comment letters from Petitioner, San Joaquin
18 LAFCO and the San Joaquin Council of Governments. The EIR analysis is inconsistent with the
19 City's General Plan, for example, the conversion of agricultural land and open space and failure
20 to comply with minimum park requirements. Horizon and/or its members submitted comments on
21 the EIR relating to these fatal flaws prior to the City Council's approval hearing on May 15, 2018.

22 10. The EIR, as adopted by City, determined that the Project would cause only one

23 significant and unavoidable impact (Transportation Impact 2b). Petitioner alleges that the City's

24 Findings which assert that several potentially significant impacts have been mitigated to a less-

25 than-significant level are not supported by substantial evidence. Horizon and/or its members

26 submitted objections to the proposed Findings (set forth in the City's Resolution approving the

27 Project) prior to the City Council's approval hearing.

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE - 4

'1 11. On or about April 11, 2018, the City Planning Commission held a public hearing

2 to consider the EIR and Land Use Approvals. At the conclusion of the public hearing, the Planning

3 Commission recommended that the City Council certify the EIR and approve the Project without

4 incorporation of any of the modifications or reviews requested by LAFCO.

5 12. Thereafter, the City released its EIR responses to comments and errata for the EIR,

6 which did not respond to San Joaquin LAFCO or San Joaquin Council of Government comments.

7 On or about May 15, 2018, the City Council held a public hearing to consider the EIR and Land

8 Use Approvals. Prior to this hearing, Petitioner's members and/or representatives objected to the

9 Project and the EIR by submitting written objections to the City.
13.
10 At the conclusion of the public hearing, the City Council adopted resolutions

11 certifying the EIR and approving the Project without modification. On or about May 18, 2018 the

12 City filed a notice of determination on the Project in the office of the San Joaquin County Clerk.

13 The NOD identifies Ponderosa Homes as the applicant, Pursuant to Public Resources Code

14 §21167.6.5(a), Petitioner has named this applicant as Real Party in Interest in this action.
STANDING. EXHAUSTION. AND RIPENESS
15 14. The Land Use Approvals were discretionary in nature, requiring mandatory
16 subjective findings. The decision-makers were required to exercise judgment and deliberation in
17 determining whether and how to approve the Project.

18 15. The Tracy City Council was presented with substantial evidence that the Project
19 would result in significant environmental effects that had not been adequately studied or mitigated

20 in the EIR, and that the City had failed to proceed in the manner required by law, including CEQA,

21 State Planning and Zoning Law, and the Tracy Municipal Code.

22 16. Petitioner has exhausted all administrative remedies concerning the Project.

23 Petitioner's representatives and/or other members of the public commented on the EIR, objected

24 to the Project at all Planning Commission and City Council hearings on the Project, and presented

25 substantial evidence that the Project will cause significant environmental impacts not adequately

26 addressed in the EIR and that the environmental review considered for the Project does not satisfy

27 the minimum requirements of CEQA. Petitioner's members and other members of the public

28 presented evidence and arguments that the Land Use Approvals are inconsistent with the Tracy

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE - 5

1 Municipal Code and General Plan on issues such as conversion of agricultural and open space land
2 and inadequate park dedication. LAFCO's comments that the agriculture land and open space
3 impact analysis and mitigation is inadequate and request for expansion of analysis are entitled to

4 great weight, given that the proposed Project's impacts directly affect agricultural and open space

5 resources in the County.

6 17. Petitioner and its members have a direct and beneficial interest in the City's full

7 compliance with CEQA and all other applicable laws when approving the Project.

8 18. The City has a mandatory and public duty to comply with CEQA, State Planning

9 and Zoning Law, the Tracy Municipal Code, and all other applicable laws when approving the

10 Project.

19.
11 The City Council has taken final action on the Land Use Approvals and therefore

12 •Petitioner's claim is ripe for review.

20.
13 Petitioner and its members will be directly and substantially affected by the adverse
environmental impacts that may result from the Project. 14 21. Petitioner has standing to bring this action as its members include residents, 15 property owners, voters, and taxpayers in and around the City of Tracy who are beneficially 16 interested in the approval of the Project. Separately, Petitioner has standing to bring this action
17 because it seeks to compel a public duty in the form of City and Real Parties complying with State
18 and local land use and environmental laws.
19 22. Petitioner will comply with the requirements of Pub. Res. Code §21167.5 by
20 mailing written notice of this action to the City.
21 23. Petitioner will comply with Pub. Res. Code §21167.7 and Code of Civ. Proc. §388
22 by notifying the Attorney General of Califomnia of the commencement of this action.

23 24. Petitioner has a right to enforce the City's mandatory duties under state and local

24 law related to the Land Use Approvals.

25 25. Petitioner does not have a plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course

26 of law.

27 26. A clear and significant benefit will be conferred upon the general public and

28 Petitioner by City fully satisfying the requirements of state and local law prior to certifying the

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE - 6

1 EIR and/or approving the Land Use Approvals. A clear and significant benefit will be

2 independently conferred upon the general public by the City fully satisfying the requirements of

3 CEQA, State Planning and Zoning Law, and applicable City zoning ordinances and planning

4 documents. In instituting this action, Petitioner seeks to procure enforcement of a mandatory duty.

5 The public, of which Petitioner's members are members, is vitally and beneficially interested in

6 assuring that the mandate of law is fully satisfied and fulfilled. Granting the relief requested by

7 Petitioner would confer a significant benefit on a large class of persons, in that fundamental rules

8 of law would be affected.

9 27. By the authority of Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, Government

10 Code sections 65009, and Public Resources Code sections 21168, 21168.5, and 21168.9, this Court

11 has jurisdiction to issue a Writ of Mandate to set aside the City's certification of the BIR and

12 approval of the Land Use Approvals.

28. Venue is proper in this Court because the causes of action alleged in this Petition
13 arose in San Joaquin County, where both the Project and the City that approved the Project are
14 located.
15 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
16 (Prejudicial Abuse of Discretion: Failure to Comply with CEQA)
17 29. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained
18 in Paragraphs 1 through 28, above.

19 30. The City committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in the
20 manner required by law in certifying an EIR that fails to sufficiently identify, analyze, disclose,

21 and mitigate significant environmental impacts from the Project, as further alleged below.

22 CONVERSION OF AGRICULTURE LAND AND OPEN SPACE

23 31. The proposed Project is currently located in San Joaquin County, and not in the

24 City of Tracy, thus requiring annexation by the City with the approval of San Joaquin LAFCO.

25 Approval of the proposed Project will result in the conversion of 134 acres of agricultural land,

26 farmland of local importance, and open space. [EIR, at p. 1-2.] A majority of the Project area is
designated Farmland of Local Importance (126.4 acres). [EIR, at p. 3.2-1.] The San Joaquin
27 General Plan land use designation for the Project area is Resource Conservation (OS/RC). [EIR,
28 at p. 3.10-10.] The County of San Joaquin Zoning Ordinance designation for the Project area is

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE - 7

1 Agriculture-Urban Reserve (AU-20). [EIR, at p. 3.2-11.] The San Joaquin County General Plan

2 found the conversion of prime agricultural land to urban uses, including the Project area, to be a

3 significant and unavoidable impact (GP EIR, at pp. 4.7-17, 18) as did the City's General Plan

4 EIR. However, the Project EIR concludes a less than significant impact based on consistency

5 with the City's General Plan. [EIR, at p. 3.2-11.] The Project's environmental documents have

6 neither adequately addressed this impact nor provided evidence that such a conversion is less

7 than significant. Thus, there is not support for its conclusion.
32.
8 The San Joaquin Local Agency Formation Commission raised this concern as
well in its September 28, 2017 comment letter, in which it stated:
9 66 the EIR concludes that conversion of agricultural land to urban use is less than
10 significant and no mitigation is required. LAFCO disagrees with this conclusion. While the
11 General Plan may have adopted a Statement of Overriding Considerations, that does not make
12 this a less than significant impact for this Project. In fact, this supports the finding of significant

13 and unavoidable, which requires mitigation. The City of Tracy adopted an Agricultural

14 Mitigation Fee ordinance. This Project needs to find that this impact is significant and

15 unavoidable and that feasible mitigation measures exist." [EIR, at pp. 19-21.] The City, in its

16 response to LAFCO, stated that because the General Plan found the impact to be significant and

17 unavoidable, and it being surrounded by urban uses on all sides, long term agricultural use is not

18 viable due to compatibility issues and the inability to undertake a large scale agricultural

19 production. The Response further stated that because of the island nature of the Project, the
conversion is considered less than significant. [EIR, at p 26.]
20 33. The Project area should be retained as agricultural and open space, which is
21 consistent with the City's General Plan Objective OSC-2.1 and corresponding Policy P1: The
22 City shall support San Joaquin County efforts to preserve existing agricultural lands in the Tracy
23 Planning Area. (EIR, at p. 3.2-9.], to: "Protect its unique identity through the preservation of

24 agricultural lands and the creation of new park and open space lands [Tracy General Plan, Goal

25 7, 1-1], and to "support existing San Joaquin County agricultural land use designations in the

26 Planning Area, and strongly oppose changes that result in increased urbanization. [Tracy

27 General Plan, Objective LU-8.1, Policy P-3 2-49.]

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE - 8

1 34. City ignored San Joaquin LAFCO's stated concerns and the explicit language of

2 its own policies and commitments, claiming instead that because City had previously designated
the affected property for urban use, and found that such designation was subject to an override
because such conversion would be significant and unavoidable, it could now assert that the

5 impact at the project level review level was less than significant. Such analysis is deficient as

6 described in East Sacramento Partnership v. City of Sacramento (2016) 5 Cal.App.5th 281; 209
Cal. Rptr. 3d 774, 792-795.
35. Accordingly, the City prejudicially abused its discretion in failing to adequately
8 evaluate and mitigate individual and cumulative impacts from the Project resulting from the loss
9 of agriculture land and open space.
10 36. Failing to provide concrete, enforceable mitigation measures for the agriculture
11 land and open space-related environmental effects of the Project reflects a failure to proceed in
12 the manner required by CEQA and a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

13 37. Additionally, Petitioner alleges the Findings as written, which are proposed to

14 a support a finding of less than significant for the agriculture land and open space-related

15 environmental effects of the Project, are not supported by substantial evidence. [Staff Report,

16 Agenda Item 5, Proposed Resolution, Exhibit 1 -Findings.] See Second Cause of Action, below.

17 BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES

38.
18 The Project not only results in an unmitigated loss of open space, but that loss, in
turn, results in other negative environmental consequences, such as impacts to area biological
19 resources. The EIR's CNDDB Recorded Occurrences 5-Mile Radius Map depicts the sensitive
20 biological resources previously documented within the vicinity of the Project area. As can be
21 seen, there are several special-status species documented to the east of the Project area (San
22 Joaquin Kit Fox, Burrowing Owl). [EIR, Exhibit 3.4-1.] The EIR concluded it did not impact a
23 wildlife movement corridor because the Project area is surrounded by residential development,

24 agricultural lands, and major roads which act as significant barriers to wildlife movement -- but

25 that is precisely the point. [EIR, at p. 3.4-4.] The Project area is the only open space providing a

26 transition to the agricultural and open space arcas to the west, and without it, these biological

27 resources have no other place to go and will be trapped and eventually no longer exist. Also,

28 four special-status birds were determined to have potential to occur on the Project site (tri-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE- 9

1 colored blackbird, burrowing owl, Swainson's hawk, and loggerhead shrike), and three species

2 of special concern (bats). [EIR, at p. 3.4-4.] Suitable habitat for protected raptors and other
birds also occur within and adjacent to the Project area, [EIR, at p. 3.4-4.] Conversion of this

4 open space area to residential uses will forever dispose of this suitable habitat.

5 39. Accordingly, the City prejudicially abused its discretion in failing to adequately

6 evaluate and mitigate individual and cumulative biological resource-related impacts from the

7 Project.
40. Failing to provide concrete, enforceable mitigation measures for the biological
resource-related environmental effects of the Project reflects a failure to proceed in the manner
9 required by CEQA and a prejudicial abuse of discretion.
10 41. Additionally, Petitioner alleges the Findings as written, which are proposed to
11 support a finding of less than significant for the biological resource-related environmental effects
12 of the Project, are not supported by substantial evidence. [Staff Report, Agenda Item 5,

13 Proposed Resolution, Exhibit -Findings.] See Second Cause of Action, below.
14 INADEQUATE PARK PROVISION

15 42. In exchange for the conversion of 134 acres of open space (126.4 Farmland, 0.3

16 rural residential and 5.8 urban/build-up), the Project proposes 21 acres of private "open space and

17 parks" (4 acres of which are for recreational buildings). [Specific Plan, at p. 2-6.] According to

18 the proposed Specific Plan, total "park" area is 3.4 acres, which does not meet the City's Park

19 Master Plan requirements of 4 acres of parkland per 1,000 residents, as the Project will result in
approximately 1,200 residents. [EIR, at p. 3.14-4, 9.] The Project development is a private, gated
20 community, and therefore the public will not benefit from any proposed open space or park areas.
21 The parks and lakes proposed by applicant do not mitigate for the net loss of nearly 100 acres
22 agricultural land and open spec, and benefit only the intended residents of Tracy Village, not the
23 remaining citizens of Tracy, or Tracy's neighbors who will be forced into the City.

24 43. Such a loss of open space flies in the face of the stated goals of the City of Tracy

25 General Plan Open Space and Conservation Element, which identifies agricultural lands and

26 unmanaged open space. to be preserve. Thus, Findings as written, which are proposed to support

27 finding of less than significant for the park and recreation-related environmental effects of the

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE - 10

'1 Project, are not supported by substantial evidence. [Staff Report, Agenda Item 5, Proposed

2 Resolution, Exhibit 1 -Findings.] See Second Cause of Action, below.

3 44. The City prejudicially abused its discretion in failing to adequately evaluate and

4 mitigate individual and cumulative park and recreation-related impacts from the Project. Failing

5 to provide concrete, enforceable mitigation measures for the park and recreation-related

6 environmental effects of the Project reflects a failure to proceed in the manner required by CEQA

7 and a prejudicial abuse of discretion.
AIR QUALITY IMPACTS - NON ATTAINMENT STATUS
8
45. The Project documents are inconsistent in that the Staff Report indicated that
9 there are air quality impacts that are significant and unavoidable, and therefore a need for the
10 Council to adopt a Statement of Overriding Considerations for the air quality impacts. However,
11 the EIR fails to identify any air quality impacts as significant and unavoidable (contrary to the
12 opinion of Horizon). [EIR, at p. ES-3; Impacts AIR-1 through 5, Air Quality Section.] The
13 City's approval of the Project indicates that the air quality impacts in the EIR have been

14 determined to be less than significant, even though the San Joaquin County Air Quality

15 Management District has defined air quality as extreme for ozone. These inconsistencies were

16 not corrected nor addressed and the City did not adopt a Statement of Overriding Considerations

17 for air quality impacts.

18 46. Failing to provide concrete, enforceable mitigation measures for the air quality-

19 related environmental effects of the Project reflects a failure to proceed in the manner required

20 by CEQA and a prejudicial abuse of discretion.
47.
21 Additionally, Petitioner alleges the Findings as written, which are proposed to
support a finding of less than significant for the air quality-related environmental effects of the
22 Project, are not supported by substantial evidence. [Staff Report, Agenda Item 5, Proposed
23 Resolution, Exhibit -Findings.] See Second Cause of Action, below.
24 AIR QUALITY IMPACTS - NO VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED EVALUATION

25 48. The City prejudicially abused its discretion in failing to adequately evaluate and

26 mitigate individual and cumulative air quality-related impacts from the Project.

27 Ill

28 ///

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE - I1

1 49. The EIR claims that VMT [vehicle miles traveled] thresholds are met because the

2 Project was considered as part of the Specific Plan. [EIR, at p. 3.3-25.] Although a Specific

3 Plan must be consistent with the City's General Plan, both documents must either be consistent

4 with the San Joaquin Air Quality Plan or discuss any inconsistency between a proposed project

5 and that plan. [See Cal. Public Resources Code §21000, and North Coast Rivers Alliance v.

6 Marin Municipal Water District Board of Directors (2013) 216 Cal. App. 4th 614, 632.] The

7 San Joaquin County Air Quality Management District's "Air Quality Guidelines for General

8 Plans," defines a direct corollary between growth in population and Vehicle Miles Traveled,
essentially wiping out improvements to air quality accomplished by improvements in vehicle 9 technologies. [SQCAQMD 1-4.] The EIR and EIR analysis instead focuses on LOS, as part of
10 its traffic evaluation, but not on the effect of the vehicle trips on air quality. Neither the EIR nor
11 the EIR addresses an essential evaluation of the travel anticipated by vehicles resulting from
12 completion of the Project on air quality as a result of vehicle miles traveled.
13 50. Given the City's and the District's acknowledgment of location in an extreme

14 ozone non-attainment area [EIR, at pp. 3.3-2, 3, 18], failure to address the impact of actual

15 anticipated traffic as determined by the EIR traffic analysis leaves the EIR legally inadequate.

16 At a minimum, the Air Quality analysis, even using the reduced car per house calculation, is then

17 evaluated in terms of short- and long-term trips anticipated for these owners within the Valley,

18 and its effects on air quality. [See for example, anticipated increases in VMT per household,
Figure 3-2; 30-3.1]

51. The Court should require further air quality analysis and recirculation of the EIR. 20 Failure to complete such analysis amounts to an impermissible deferral of evaluation of impacts.

23 52. Omitting this information from the EIR is prejudicial to the air quality-related
24 impacts disclosure and analysis process and renders the EIR legally inadequate.

25 53. The City prejudicially abused its discretion in failing to adequately evaluate and
26 mitigate individual and cumulative air quality-related impacts from the Project.

1 54. Failing to provide concrete, enforceable mitigation measures for the air quality-

2 related environmental effects of the Project reflects a failure to proceed in the manner required

3 a by CEQA and a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

4 55. Additionally, Petitioner alleges the Findings as written, which are proposed to

5 support a finding of less than significant for the air quality-related environmental effects of the

6 Project, are not supported by substantial evidence. [Staff Report, Agenda Item 5, Proposed

7 Resolution, Exhibit 1 -Findings.] See Second Cause of Action, below.
AIR QUALITY IMPACTS - NO HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENT FOR VALLEY FEVER
8 56. Although the Project's EIR acknowledges nearby sensitive receptors within 20
9 feet of the Project area [EIR, at p. 3.3-36 (residential homes)], no Health Risk Assessment has
10 been prepared to address the Valley Fever potential impact, endemic to San Joaquin Valley. No
11 site-specific soils report has been prepared to determine whether Project arca soils a are a potential
12 breeding ground for Valley Fever spores. [EIR, at p. 1-9.] Valley Fever, or
13 coccidioidomycosis, is an infection caused by inhalation of the spores of the fungus Coccidioides

14 immitis (C, immitis). [EIR, at p. 3.3-38.] The spores live in soil and can live for an extended time

15 in harsh environmental conditions. Activities or conditions that increase the amount of fugitive

16 dust and contribute to greater exposure include dust storms and grading. [EIR, at p. 3.3-38.] The

17 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates that 752 of 8,657 people hospitalized for

18 Valley Fever between 2000 and 2007 died (8.7 percent). [EIR, at p. 3.3-39, citing CDC 2009.]
57.
19 The EIR states that avoidance, when possible, of sites favorable for the
occurrence of C. immitis is a prudent risk management strategy, and also provides of list of
20 ecologic factors and sites favorable for the occurrence of C. immitis, at least two of which factors
21 as described apply to the Project area: (3) areas with sparse vegetation and alkaline soils; and (7)
22 upper 30 centimeters of the soil horizon, especially in virgin undisturbed soils. [EIR, at p. 3.3-
23 39.] Although the EIR acknowledges that the Project site is currently undeveloped, it
24 erroneously concludes that because the majority of the Project site and the immediately
25 surrounding vicinity consists of urbanized development or cultivated fields, the Project site is an

26 area "that would lead to a low probability of having C. immitis growth sites and exposure from

27 disturbed soil." [EIR, at p. 3.3-39.]

1 58. The Preliminary Geotcchnical Report did not investigate the possible release of
2 Valley Fever spores. [EIR, at p. 3.6-8.] Without such testing data and specific site analysis, the

3 conclusions reached in the Project environmental document are not supported by substantial

4 evidence, and any proposed mitigation, such as dust minimizing control measures, are
speculative. The EIR admits that there is a very high ratio of deaths as a result of disturbing soil

6 containing Valley Fever spores. [EIR at p. 3.3-39.] As written, this impact should be changed

7 from less-than-significant to significant and unavoidable, and this Council should justify

8 approval of this Project and this impact through a Statement of Overriding Considerations.
59.
9 Omitting this information from the EIR is prejudicial to the air quality-related
impacts disclosure and analysis process and renders the EIR legally inadequate.
10 60. The City prejudicially abused its discretion in failing to adequately evaluate and
11 mitigate individual and cumulative air quality-related impacts from the Project.
12 61. Failing to provide concrete, enforceable mitigation measures for the air quality-
13 related environmental effects of the Project reflects a failure to proceed in the manner required
14 by CEQA and a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

15 62. Additionally, Petitioner alleges the Findings as written, which are proposed to

16 support a finding of less than significant for the air quality-related environmental effects of the

17 Project, are not supported by substantial evidence. [Staff Report, Agenda Item 5, Proposed

18 Resolution, Exhibit 1 -Findings.] See Second Cause of Action, below.
LAKE ISSUES - RELIANCE ON RECYCLED WATER
19 63.
20 City failed to adequately evaluate the Project's Recycled Water Plan and has

21 improperly deferred mitigation of the storm drain system. The Project includes three man-made
lakes to be used as water supply for Project irrigation and on-site water treatment and storm
22 drainage. [EIR, at pp. 3.17-13; 3.9-18.] The lakes are to be filled and the levels maintained with
23 recycled water from the City's Recycled Water Plan infrastructure, which has yet to be
24 constructed. [EIR, at p. 3.17-13.] Until then, the developer may use the City's potable water

25 supply for this purpose. [EIR, at p. 3.17-13.] As mitigation, the developer will be required to
26 pay a proportional share of funding for the acquisition, treatment, and delivery of potable and

27 recycled water supplies to the Project area. [MM-USS-1, EIR, at p. 3.17-15.] All stormwater

28 runoff from the Project would drain to the lake system for treatment prior to discharging to the

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE - 14

i downstream watershed. [EIR, at p. 3.9-22.] The Project would include the development of a
2 storm drain system and would implement a SWMP to manage the pollutant load, rate, and

3 volume of stormwater in the Project. [EIR, at p. 3.9-25.] Details and engineering analysis for

4 the storm drain system are to be evaluated during engineering design of the Project. [EIR, at p.

5 3.9-25.]

6 64. The EIR acknowledges that the City's recycled water infrastructure may not be

7 built prior to completion of the City's Recycled Water Project in early 2019. [Specific Plan, at p.

8 4-22; EIR, at p. 3.17-13-15.] The Specific Plan admits that delays in the ability to hook-up to the

9 recycled water main could delay the ability of the Project to use recycled water, requiring the use
of City potable water supplies as an alternative. [Specific Plan, at p. 4-22.] The exact recycled
10 water line connection to the Project area were unknown at the time of approval and impacts werel
11 not evaluated. [EIR, at p. 2-14.]
12 65. Reliance on the City's potable water supply to fill the lakes until such time as the
13 recycled water plan comes on-line should not be allowed because reliance impermissibly allows
14 for approval without evaluating the impacts to the City's water supply, especially given historic

15 water shortages with the City. Any such reliance should only occur after complete evaluation.

16 66. Failing to provide concrete, enforceable mitigation measures for the water-related

17 environmental effects of the Project reflects a failure to proceed in the manner required by

18 CEQA and a prejudicial abuse of discretion.
67.
19 The City prejudicially abused its discretion in failing to adequately evaluate and

20 mitigate individual and cumulative water-related impacts from the Project.
68. Additionally, Petitioner alleges the Findings as written, which are proposed to
21 support a finding of less than significant for the water-related environmental effects of the
22 Project, are not supported by substantial evidence. [Staff Report, Agenda Item 5, Proposed
23 Resolution, Exhibit 1 -Findings.] See Second Cause of Action, below.
24 LAKE ISSUES - INCONSISTENT WATER SUPPLY ANALYSIS

25 69. Under CEQA, the City must consider the direct or reasonably foreseeable indirect

26 effects of the Project on the surrounding environment. [Public Resources Code §21065.]

27 Concerning the Project's recycled water demand, the EIR fails to address the provision of

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE - 15

• 1 recycled water if final construction is not complete at the time required for the RWQCB permits

2 [argued above],

3 70. The Water Supply Analysis [EIR, Appendix I] asserts that there is currently

4 sufficient water available even in drought years to provide for all the water needs of the City, the
Project, including for the lakes included in the Project design, although it also admits that the

6 Delta-Mendota Subbasin and the Eastern San Joaquin basin which border the Tracy subbasin are

7 currently designated as being in conditions of critical overdraft, while claiming that the Tracy
subbasin is not presently so designated. [WSA §6.1-6.3.] The Tracy Basin is designated as
8 "medium". requiring that the Basin must prepare groundwater management plans by 2022.
9 Therefore, there is no basis for the conclusion as stated in the WSA that even in extremely dry
10 years, water from the City's wells may be used to maintain both the Project's lakes and the need
11 for its potable water.
12 71. The WSA, §1.1.2 and the EIR also acknowledge that the surrounding owners, if
13 forced into the City by annexation, will be allowed to choose City services, but neglect

14 consideration of well draw-down on these property owners' wells. The WSA does not discuss

15 the Project's impact on the more shallow personal wells adjacent to the proposed residential

16 project. [WSA §6.1-6.3.] Therefore, City's failure to evaluate this impact prior to submission

17 violates its obligations under CEQA prior to approval.
72.
18 Failing to provide concrete, enforceable mitigation measures for the water-related

19 environmental effects of the Project reflects a failure to proceed in the manner required by
CEQA and a prejudicial abuse of discretion.
20 73. Omitting this information from the EIR is prejudicial to the water-related impacts
21 disclosure and analysis process and renders the EIR legally inadequate.
22 74. The City prejudicially abused its discretion in failing to adequately evaluate and

23 mitigate individual and cumulative water-related impacts from the Project.

24 75. Additionally, Petitioner alleges the Findings as written, which are proposed to

25 support a finding of less than significant for the water-related environmental effects of the

26 Project, are not supported by substantial evidence. [Staff Report, Agenda Item 5, Proposed

27 Resolution, Exhibit 1 -Findings.] See Second Cause of Action, below.

LAKE ISSUES - BIRD HAZARDS

2 76. Petitioner alleges the Findings support a less than significant impact from these

3 bird-related safety hazards (HAZ-3 and TRANS-5), are not supported by substantial evidence.

4 [Staff Report, Agenda Item 5, Proposed Resolution, Exhibit 1 -Findings.] See Second Cause of

5 Action, below.

6 77. The southern one-half of the Project area lies within the Tracy Municipal Airport

7 Zone 7 Traffic Pattern Zone. [EIR, at r 3.8-14.] Zone 7 land use restrictions include flight
hazards such as physical, visual, and electronic forms of interference with the safety of aircraft
8 operations. Specifically prohibited are "land use developments that may cause increased
9 attraction to birds." [EIR, at p. 3.8-14.] The Project area's man-made lakes, totaling
10 approximately 10.5 acres, create a potential impact to safety from flocks of birds attracted to the
11 lakes as also objected by The San Joaquin Council of Governments ("SJCOG").

12 78. The EIR's suggested design measures are not supported. The EIR indicated the

13 design measure "may discourage" water fowl-related safety hazards but provided no evidence for

14 a success rate, did not revisc its MM-HAZ-3 in response to SJCOG's statement of concerns and

15 concludes that the impact of this potential safety hazard would be considered less-than-

16 significant based on this speculative and unproven mitigation. [EIR, at p. 3.8-14 to 17.]

17 79. The City prejudicially abused its discretion in failing to adequately evaluate and

18 mitigate individual and cumulative water-related safety impacts from the Project.
80.
19 Failing to provide concrete, enforceable mitigation measures for the water-related
environmental and safety impacts of the Project reflects a failure to proceed in the manner
20 required by CEQA and a prejudicial abuse of discretion.
21 81. Additionally, Petitioner alleges the Findings as written, which are proposed to
22 support a finding of less than significant for the water-related environmental effects of the
23 Project, are not supported by substantial evidence. [Staff Report, Agenda Item 5, Proposed

24 Resolution, Exhibit 1 -Findings.] See Second Cause of Action, below.
25 SIGNIFICANT AND UNAVOIDABLE IMPACTS INCONSISTENCIES

26 82. The Staff Report provided to the public before the May 15, 2018 approval hearing

27 indicated that there were air quality impacts that are significant and unavoidable and suggested

28 that the Council adopt a Statement of Overriding Considerations for the air quality impacts.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE - 17

1 However, the EIR failed to identify any air quality impacts as significant and unavoidable. [EIR,
2 at p. ES-3. As described above, multiple adverse air quality impacts should be evaluated and the

3 impacts disclosed and adequate mitigation provided.

4 83. The Staff Report also did not identify Transportation Impact 2b as a significant

5 and unavoidable impact, yet the EIR stated that this impact is the one and only significant and

6 unavoidable impact. [EIR, at p. ES-3.] Members of the public have been misled by the

7 summary analysis in the Staff Report and received incorrect and conflicting information about

8 substantive and material issues. This information has never been clarified nor corrected prior to
the May 15, 2018 approval of the Project although the City received notice of these defects.
9 84. Omitting and/or not clarifying the Project documents is prejudicial to the
10 disclosure and analysis process and renders the EIR legally inadequate.
11 85. The City prejudicially abused its discretion in failing to adequately evaluate and
12 mitigate individual and cumulative impacts from the Project.
13 86. Failing to provide concrete, enforceable mitigation measures for these significant
14 environmental effects of the Project reflects a failure to procced in the manner required by

15 CEQA and a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

16 87. Additionally, Petitioner alleges the Findings as written, which are proposed to

17 support findings of less than significant for the environmental effects of the Project, are not

18 supported by substantial evidence. [Staff Report, Agenda Item 5, Proposed Resolution, Exhibit

19 -Findings.] See Second Cause of Action, below.
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
20 (Prejudicial Abuse of Discretion: Findings not Supported by Evidence)
21 88. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained
22 in Paragraphs 1 through 88, above.
23 89. The State Supreme Court has explained, "an agency which renders the challenged
24 decision must set forth findings to bridge the analytical gap between the raw evidence and ultimate
25 decision or order." Topanga Ass'n for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles (1974) 11

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE - 18

1 90. CEQA Guidelines $5 15091 and 15093 required the City to adopt specific findings
2 prior to approving the Project.

3 91. The findings prepared and adopted by the City, including those contained in the

4 resolutions, staff reports, and other documents in support of the Land Use Approvals, are not

5 supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record and do not bridge the analytical gap

6 between the evidence and the decision.

7 92. Consequently, the City's decision to approve the Project is not supported by

8 substantial evidence, and the City failed to proceed in the manner required by law and prejudicially

9 abused its discretion in approving the Project.

10 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

11 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays as follows:
1.
12 That this Court issue a peremptory writ of mandate:

13 a. Commanding the City to immediately set aside its decisions to certify the EIR
and to approve the Project;
14 b. Commanding the City to immediately suspend all activities in furtherance of
15 the Land Use Approvals, including but not limited to issuing grading permits, building permits,
16 certificates of occupancy, and engaging in any construction in furtherance of the development of
17 the Project;
18 c. Commanding the City to set aside the certification of the EIR and to comply
19 with CEQA and all other applicable laws in any subsequent action taken to approve the Project;
20 2. For a stay, preliminary restraining order, and/or preliminary and permanent
21 injunction restraining the City and Real Party from taking any action to carry out the Project
22 pending the outcome of this litigation;

23 3. That Petitioner be awarded the cost incurred in bringing this action, and reasonable

24 attorney fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, the "common benefit" theory,

25 Government Code section 800, or as otherwise provided by law or equity; and
