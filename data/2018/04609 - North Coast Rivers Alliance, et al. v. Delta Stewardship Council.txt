22 Petitioners North Coast Rivers Alliance, et al., hereby petition the Court a for a writ of mandate
23 against respondent Delta Stewardship Council and by this verified petition allege as follows:

24 INTRODUCTION

25 1. This is a public interest citizen suit to enforce California's environmental laws and protect
26 the Delta from imminent ecologic collapse. Petitioners bring this action to challenge the Delta
27 Stewardship Council's ("Council's") approval of its Delta Plan Amendments ("Delta Plan Amendments"
28 or "DPA") and certification of its Program Environmental Impact Report ("PEIR") on April 26, 2018. In

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES 1.

t Itaking these actions, the Council violated the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public
2 Resources Code section 21000 et seq., the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Reform Act of 2009 ("Delta
3 Reform Act"), Water Code section 85000 et seq., and the Public Trust Doctrine.

4 2. CEQA requires the Council to fully examine the impacts of continuing the existing,
5 excessive level of water exports from the Delta, and to carefully consider alternatives that would avoid
6 and reduce those impacts. Contrary to CEQA, the Council's PEIR does neither. Although it purports to
7 analyze the environmental impacts of the DPA as required by CEQA, its real - but undisclosed - agenda
8 is to bless the Department of Water Resources ('DWR's") approval on July 21, 2017 of the so-called
9 "California WaterFix" ("WaterFix"), which will harm rather than restore the Delta's ecological health by
10 diverting most of the Sacramento River's summer flow before it even reaches the Delta. To that end, the
11 PEIR understates the impacts of the WaterFix and fails to adequately consider feasible alternatives and
12 mitigation measures that would prevent the Delta's further ecologic collapse. Because the PEIR falls far
13 short of achieving CEQA's twin mandates of identifying and avoiding significant environmental harm, it
14 violates CEQA.

15 3. The Delta Reform Act requires the Council to complete a Delta Plan to achieve the "cO-
16 equal goals" of "providing a more reliable water supply for California and protecting, restoring, and
17 enhancing the Delta ecosystem." (Water Code §8 85054, 85300.) The DPA does not achieve these goals.
18 Instead, it accommodates the WaterFix and its unsustainable levels of Delta exports that will thwart
19 protection and restoration of the Delta ecosystem. Because the DPA will harm rather than restore the
20 Delta's imperiled fish and wildlife, it violates the Delta Reform Act.

21 4. The Public Trust Doctrine protects the Delta's imperiled fish and wildlife from avoidable
22 harm whenever it is feasible to do so. Contrary to this mandate, the DPA accommodates the WaterFix
23 land its unsustainable level of Delta exports that will needlessly harm public trust resources, and dismisses
24 from consideration feasible alternatives and mitigation measures that would protect and restore the
25 Delta's ecological functions. Because the DPA harms rather than protects the Delta's fish and wildlife, it
26 Iviolates the Public Trust Doctrine.

27 VENUE AND JURISDICTION

28 5. This Court has jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
'DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES - 2 -

1 (**CCP") sections 526 (injunctive relief), 1060 (declaratory relief), 1085 (traditional mandamus), and
2 1094.5 (administrative mandamus); Public Resources Code ("PRC") sections 21168 and 21168.5
3 (mandamus review); and article VI, section 10 of the California Constitution.

4 6. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to CCP sections 393 (actions against public
5 officers) and 395 (actions generally) because the Council's offices are located in Sacramento.

6 7. Pursuant to CCP section 388, petitioners are serving the California Attorney General with
7 la copy of this verified petition and complaint. Consistent with PRC section 21167.5, petitioners timely
8 served the Council with notice of this suit.

9 PARTIES

10 8. Petitioner NORTH COAST RIVERS ALLIANCE ("North Coast Rivers") is a non-profit
11 unincorporated association with members throughout Northern California. North Coast Rivers was
12 formed for the purpose of protecting California's rivers and their watersheds from the adverse effects of
13 lexcessive water diversions, ill-planned urban development, harmful resource extraction, pollution, and
14 other forms of environmental degradation. Its members use and enjoy California's rivers and watersheds
15 for recreational, aesthetic, scientific study, and related non-consumptive uses. The interests of North
16 Coast Rivers and its members have been, are being, and unless the relief requested herein is granted, will
17 be adversely affected and injured by the Council's approval of the DPA and certification of its inadequate
18 PEIR.

19 9. Petitioner INSTITUTE FOR FISHERIES RESOURCES ("IFR") is a non-profit, tax-
20 exempt organization that works to protect and restore salmon and other fish populations and the human
21 economies that depend on them. IFR maintains its principal place of business in San Francisco,
22 |California. IFR both funds and manages many fish habitat protection programs and initiatives. In that
23 capacity, IFR advocates for measures to protect fish health and habitat and has successfully advocated for
24 dam removals, improved pesticide controls, better forestry stream protection standards, and enhanced
25 marine and watershed conservation regulations throughout the West Coast. IFR has worked tirelessly for
26 years to restore and enhance the Delta and its beleaguered fish and wildlife. IFR and its members will be
27 directly and indirectly injured by the DPA's failure to adequately protect and restore the imperiled
28 Ifisheries of the Delta.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR "DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES - 3

1 10. Petitioner PACIFIC COAST FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATIONS
2 ("Pacific Coast Fishermen") is a nonprofit membership organization incorporated in 1976 with
3 headquarters located in San Francisco, California. Pacific Coast Fishermen is composed of more than 20

4 separate commercial fishing and vessel owners' associations along the West Coast. By virtue of its
5 combined membership, Pacific Coast Fishermen is the single largest commercial fishing organization on
6 the West Coast. Pacific Coast Fishermen represents the majority of California's organized commercial
7 salmon fishermen and has been an active advocate for the protection of Pacific salmon for more than 20
8 years. Pacific Coast Fishermen and its members will be harmed by the DPA because it would undermine
9 sustainable management of the salmonid fisheries resources of the Delta and its connected ecosystems on
10 which these members rely for their commercial fishing livelihoods.

11 11. Petitioner SAN FRANCISCO CRAB BOAT OWNERS ASSOCIATION ("San Francisco
12 Fishermen") is a century-old association of owners and operators of small, family owned fishing boats
13 that catch Dungeness crab, wild California King salmon, Pacific herring, and other species that live in and
14 depend upon the cold waters of the Pacific Ocean. San Francisco Fishermen is also actively involved in
15 community education and advocacy concerning fisheries resources legislation to ensure that the rich
16 heritage of commercial fishing in the Bay Area will survive for future generations. San Francisco
17 Fishermen and its members will be harmed by the DPA because it would threaten their continued historic
18 use and enjoyment of the fisheries resources of the Delta and its connected ecosystems.

19 12. Petitioner WINNEMEM WINTU TRIBE is a Native American Tribe whose aboriginal
20 territory encompasses the upper watersheds of the Sacramento River including the McCloud River. The
21 Winnemem Wintu Tribe was traditionally dependent on salmon fishing for both subsistence and cultural
22 Ipurposes, and maintains a deep cultural, spiritual and recreational interest in the continued viability of
23 /California's salmon runs that pass through the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta ("Delta"). The
24 Winnemem Wintu Tribe is a strong proponent of Delta restoration, and will be harmed by the reduced
25 Delta fresh water flows, degradation of water quality, destruction of fish and wildlife species, and other
26 environmental harms that implementation of the DPA will allow.

27 13. Respondent DELTA STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL ("Council") is a California public
28 agency established by the Delta Reform Act and required by that Act to protect and restore the fish and

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR 'DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEP AND ATTORNEYS' FEES - 4 -

wildlife of the Delta. Its approval of the DPA is subject to and violated the requirements of the Delta
2 Reform Act, CEQA, and the Public Trust Doctrine. The Council is the lead agency under CEQA for
3 environmental review of the DPA.

4 14. The true names and capacities of respondents DOES I-XX, inclusive, are unknown to
5 petitioners who therefore sue such respondents by fictitious names pursuant to CCP section 474.
6 Petitioners are informed and believe, and based on such information and belief allege, that the fictitiously
7 named respondents are public officials or agencies who are responsible, in whole or in part, for the
8 approval and implementation of the DPA. Petitioners will, with leave of Court if necessary, amend this
Verified Petition if and when the true names and capacities of said DOE respondents have been

10 ascertained.

11 15. The Council did not identify any real parties in interest in its Notice of Determination for
12 the DPA pursuant to PRC section 21167.6.5(a), and petitioners are not otherwise aware that any real
13 |parties in interest exist. The true names and capacities of real parties in interest DOES XXI-L, inclusive,
14 are unknown to petitioners who therefore sue such real parties in interest by fictitious names pursuant to
15 CCP section 474. Petitioners are informed and believe, and based on such information and belief allege,
16 that the fictitiously named real parties in interest have a direct interest in approval of the DPA.
17 Petitioners will, with leave of Court if necessary, amend this Verified Petition if and when the true names
18 and capacities of said DOE real parties in interest have been ascertained.

19 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

20 16. Petitioners have authorized their attorneys to file this lawsuit on their behalf to vindicate
21 their substantial beneficial interest in securing the Council's compliance with the law.

22 17. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to the filing of this Verified
23 Petition and Complaint and have exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent
24 required by law.

25 18. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law
26 within the meaning of CCP section 1086 in that, unless this Court issues its writ of mandate setting aside
27 the Council's approval of the DPA, and ordering it to comply with the laws whose violation is alleged
28 herein, the environmental interests of petitioners and the public that are protected by those laws will be

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES - 5 -

1 substantially and irreparably harmed. No monetary damages or other legal remedy could adequately
2 compensate petitioners for the harm to their beneficial interests, and to the environment, occasioned by
3 the Council's unlawful conduct.

4 19. Petitioners are entitled to declaratory relief under CCP section 1060 because an actual
5 controversy exists between petitioners and the Council. Petitioners contend that the Council has acted in
6 violation of applicable laws and must therefore vacate and set aside its approval of the DPA. Petitioners
7 are informed and believe that the Council disputes this contention. A judicial resolution of this
8 controversy is therefore necessary and appropriate.

9 20. Petitioners are also entitled to injunctive relief under CCP section 526 because approval of
10 the DPA threatens irreparable environmental harm. Unless enjoined, the Council will implement the
11 DPA despite its lack of compliance with applicable laws, causing undue and unnecessary environmental
12 degradation. Petitioners would thereby suffer irreparable harm due to the Council's failure to take the
13 required steps to adequately protect the environment. Injunctive relief is thus warranted under CCP
14 section 525 et seq. and PRC section 21168.9 to prevent irreparable harm to the environment.
15 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

16 21. "[T]he Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta is a natural resource of statewide, national,
17 and international significance, containing irreplaceable resources." (PRC § 29701.) The Delta is the
18 largest and most productive estuarine system on the West Coast of North and South America, but its
19 future is in peril. It is the State of California's avowed policy "to recognize, preserve, and protect those
20 resources of the delta for the use and enjoyment of current and future generations." (Id.)

21 22. The Delta's imminent ecologic collapse is well-recognized and indisputable. It has two
22 principal causes. First, an unsustainable proportion of the Delta's freshwater flows has been diverted for
23 decades by the Central Valley Project ("CVP") and the State Water Project ("SWP"). Second, for too
24 long, agricultural diverters have discharged run-off contaminated with salt, selenium, and other toxic
25 substances back into the rivers and groundwaters that are tributary to the Delta. This one-two punch of
26 diminished freshwater flows and increased temperature, salinity and herbicides, pesticides, and heavy
27 metals has pushed the Delta to the brink of ecologic collapse.

28 23. Due to excessive diversions of water for consumptive use, many species of fish endemic to

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR "DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES . 6 -

1 the Delta have already gone extinct, including the Sacramento perch, formerly one of the most abundant
2 fish of the Delta, which disappeared in the 1970s. Just 12 indigenous species remain, and these are in
3 grave danger. Since the SWP and CVP began operation, the Sacramento River winter and spring run
4 Chinook salmon, Central Valley steelhead, North American green sturgeon and Delta smelt have been
5 driven perilously close to extirpation. Each of these species is listed as either endangered or threatened
6 lunder the federal Endangered Species Act.

7 24. In addition to harming many fish species in the Delta, the excessive use of Delta water
8 exports to irrigate contaminated soils in the San Joaquin Valley pollutes ground and surface waters that
9 flow into the Delta. Irrigation leaches pollutants from the toxic soils underlying many of the areas
10 lirrigated with Delta water. The subsurface drainage and surface run off from these contaminated soils
11 contain pollutants including selenium, arsenic, boron, mercury, uranium, chromium, molybdenum and
12 sodium sulfates. The resulting pollution of the Delta and its San Joaquin Valley tributaries threatens the
13 Delta's water quality and the fish and wildlife dependent on them.

14 25. To address the indisputably perilous state of the Delta, in 2009 the California Legislature
15 enacted the Delta Reform Act, declaring that "[t]he Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta watershed and
16 |California's water infrastructure are in crisis and existing Delta policies are not sustainable." (Water
17 Code § 85001(a) (emphasis added).) The Legislature found that "the Delta' a is a critically important
18 natural resource for California and the nation. It serves Californians concurrently as both the hub of the
19 California water system and the most valuable estuary and wetland ecosystem on the west coast of North
20 (and South America." (Water Code § 85002.) "Resolving the crisis requires fundamental reorganization
21 of the state's management of Delta watershed resources." (Water Code § 85001(a) (emphasis added).)
22 /Therefore, the Legislature resolved "to provide for the sustainable management of the [Delta] ecosystem,
23 to provide for a more reliable water supply for the state, to protect and enhance the quality of water
24 supply from the Delta, and to establish : governance structure that will direct efforts across state agencies
25 to develop a legally enforceable Delta Plan." (Water Code 85001(c) (emphasis added).)

26 26. The Delta Reform Act was meant to advance the "coequal goals" of restoring the Delta
27 ecosystem and ensuring water supply reliability. (Water Code § 85054.) The Legislature found that eight
28 "objectives" were inherent in those coequal goals:

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
'DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES - 7-

1 (a) Manage the Delta's water and environmental resources and the water resources of the

2 state over the long term.
(b) Protect and enhance the unique cultural, recreational, and agricultural values of the
3 California Delta as an evolving place.

4 (c) Restore the Delta ecosystem, including its fisheries and wildlife, as the heart of a healthy estuary and wetland ecosystem.
5

6 (d) Promote statewide water conservation, water use efficiency, and sustainable water use.

7 (e) Improve water quality to protect human health and the environment consistent with achieving water quality objectives in the Delta.

8 (f) Improve the water conveyance system and expand statewide water storage.
9 (g) Reduce risks to people, property, and state interests in the Delta by effective emergency preparedness, appropriate land uses, and investments in flood protection.
10
(h) Establish a new governance structure with the authority, responsibility, accountability,
11 scientific support, and adequate and secure funding to achieve these objectives.
12 (Water Code § 85020 (emphasis added).)

13 27. The Legislature also declared that:

14 The policy of the State of California is to reduce reliance on the Delta in meeting

15 California's future water supply needs through a statewide strategy of investing in improved regional supplies, conservation, and water use efficiency. Each region that depends on water from the Delta watershed shall improve its regional self-reliance for 16 water through investment in water use efficiency, water recycling, advanced water

17 technologies, local and regional water supply projects, and improved regional coordination of local and regional water supply efforts.
18 (Water Code § 85021 (emphasis added).)
19 28. Reasonable use and the Public Trust Doctrine are to be the "foundation of state water
20 management policy." (Water Code § 85023.)

21 29. To achieve these environmental protections, the Delta Reform Act tasked the Council with
22 developing the Delta Plan. After repeated revisions of the Draft Delta Plan in 2011, the Council released
23 the Fifth Staff Draft Delta Plan in August 2011, and the Draft Delta Plan Program EIR in November
24 (2011. Petitioners submitted extensive comments on both. After the public comment period, the Council
25 issued a Recirculated Draft Delta Plan FEIR ("RDFEIR") in November 2012. The Council then certified
26 the Final Delta Plan PEIR ("FPEIR") and approved the Delta Plan at a public meeting on May 16, 2013,
27 and published its CEQA Notice of Determination the next day.

28 30. Petitioners filed a Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate seeking judicial review of the

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR "DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES - 8 -

1 Delta Plan on June 14, 2013. After three years of litigation, petitioners prevailed. On May 18, 2016,
2 Sacramento County Superior Court Judge Michael P. Kenny issued a 73-page Ruling on Submitted
3 Matter overturning the Council's approval of the Delta Plan on the grounds it violated the Delta Reform

4 Act. Judge Kenny's Ruling found that the Delta Plan failed to "[i]nclude quantified or otherwise
5 measurable targets associated with achieving reduced Delta reliance, reduced environmental harm from
6 invasive species, restoring more natural flows, and increased water supply reliability, in accordance with
7 the Delta Reform Act." (Ruling on Submitted Matter filed May 18, 2016 in the matter In Re Delta
8 Stewardship Council Cases, JCCP No. 4758 ("Ruling"), at 26.) Petitioners forwarded a copy of Judge
9 Kenny's Ruling to the Council along with a letter summarizing its major holdings on June 21, 2016.
10 Judge Kenny clarified and strengthened his Ruling by his Clarification Order filed June 24, 2016, stating
11 |that "[t]o be clear, the Delta Plan is invalid and must be set aside until proper revisions are completed."
12 (Id. at 4.)

13 31. Pursuant to the Ruling and Clarification Order, on October 21, 2016, the Superior Court
14 entered Judgment directing issuance of

15 "[a] Peremptory Writ of Mandate .. . ordering Respondent [Delta Stewardship Council] to set aside the Delta Plan because it is invalid due to the deficiencies identified in the
16 Court's Ruling and Clarification Order and to remedy those deficiencies in the Delta Plan

17 and any applicable regulations by revising the Delta Plan and any applicable regulations to include quantified or otherwise measurable targets associated with:

18 a. b. achieving reduced Delta reliance; reduced environmental harm from invasive species; 19 57 restoring more natural flows; and increased water supply reliability 20
in accordance with the Delta Reform Act.33
21

22 (Judgment filed October 21, 2016 in North Coast Rivers Alliance v. Delta Stewardship Council, JCCP
23 No. 4758, at 3:1-10.)

24 32. Rather than comply with Judge Kenny's Judgment and Peremptory Writ of Mandate, the
25 | Council filed a Notice of Appeal. However, the mere filing of an appeal by the Council does not
26 automatically stay the Superior Court's Judgment as might otherwise be the case in non-writ proceedings
27 |pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 916. Instead, the Superior Court retains jurisdiction to
28 enforce its Judgment "because the rules governing the application of stays . .. on appeal in a civil 'action'

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
'DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES . 9-

H (Code Civ. Proc., § 22) do not apply in a 'special proceeding' (Code Civ. Proc. § 23)." (Veyna v. Orange
2 County Nursery, Inc. (2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 146, 155 (citing Agricultural Labor Relations Bd. v. Tex-
3 Cal Land Management, Inc. (1987) 43 Cal.3d 696, 707.)) Petitioners' writ proceeding was brought
4 |pursuant to CCP section 1085 et seq. Therefore it is a "special proceeding" as defined in CCP sections
5 23 and 1067-1131.

6 33. Further, even if CCP section 916 otherwise applied, it would operate to stay only that
7 portion of the Judgment that constituted a "mandatory" injunction. A mandatory injunction is one that
8 compel[s] the performance of a substantive act or a change in the relative positions of the parties."
9 (People v. Mobile Magic Sales, Inc. (1979) 96 Cal.App.3d 1, 13.) "By contrast, the prohibitive [or
10 prohibitory] order seeks to restrain a party from a course of conduct or to halt a particular condition."
11 (Id.) And, "the character of prohibitory injunctive relief, however, is not changed to mandatory in nature
12 merely because it incidentally requires performance of an affirmative act." (Id., citing United Railroads
13 v. Superior Court (1916) 172 Cal.80, 88-89.)

14 34. Judge Kenny's Peremptory Writ of Mandate and Judgment are prohibitory, rather than
15 mandatory, in character because they require the Council to suspend or rescind its unlawful approval of
16 the Delta Plan. By thus restraining the Council from implementing the Delta Plan, the Peremptory Writ
17 of Mandate and Judgment prohibit the Council's otherwise unlawful implementation of the unlawfully-
18 approved Delta Plan. Therefore, the character of the Peremptory Writ of Mandate and Judgment is
19 prohibitory," rather than "mandatory." As noted, "[t]he character of prohibitory injunctive relief... is
20 not changed to mandatory .  merely because it incidentally requires performance of an affirmative act"
21 such as the Council's rescission of its unlawful approval of the Delta Plan. (People v. Mobile Magic
22 ¡Sales, Inc., supra, 96 Cal.App.3d at 13; United Railroads v. Superior Court, supra, 172 Cal. at 88-89
23 (emphasis added).)

24 35. Because the Council's mere filing of a Notice of Appeal did not stay Judge Kenny's
25 Judgment and Peremptory Writ of Mandate, the Council remains subject to the Superior Court's
26 Peremptory Writ of Mandate and Judgment and is under a continuing duty to rescind its unlawful Delta
27 (Plan. Instead of discharging its duty to rescind the Delta Plan, the Council has ignored Judge Kenny's
28 Judgment and Peremptory Writ of Mandate, as if they did not exist. The Council's Draft PEIR, for

VERIFIED PETITION POR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR "DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES - 10 -

1 Jexample, never mentions either the Peremptory Writ of Mandate or the Judgment.

2 36. Despite requests by petitioners and others that the Council comply with the Peremptory
3 Writ of Mandate and Judgment, the Council has continued to act as though its Delta Plan had not been

4 ruled "invalid" and set aside by Judge Kenny. To the contrary, the Council confirmed its seeming
5 disregard of Judge Kenny's Judgment and Peremptory Writ of Mandate by purporting on April 26, 2018

6 to approve three Amendments to the Delta Plan and related regulations ("Delta Plan Amendments" or
7 "DPA"), certify a Program Environmental Impact Report ("PEIR") thereon, adopt Findings purporting to
8 support approval of the DPA, and adopt Statement of Overriding Considerations ("SOC") justifying
9 Japproval of the DPA notwithstanding its admittedly significant adverse environmental impacts. The
10 Council then filed a Notice of Determination for these approvals with the Governor's Office of Planning
11 land Research purportedly in compliance with Public Resources Code section 21083.

12 37. The Delta Plan PEIR states that the DPA will "promote options for water conveyance,
13 storage systems and the operation of both as required by Wat[er] Code section 65304." (PEIR at 3-17.)
14 However, only one "conveyance option" is "promoted" - the so-called California WaterFix previously
15 approved by the Department of Water Resources. The PEIR directs that "[t]he DWR [Department of
16 /Water Resources] and [the U.S. Bureau of| Reclamation, and local beneficiary agencies should pursue a
17 dual conveyance option for the Delta." (Id. at 3-18 (emphasis added).) The PEIR's reference to the "dual
18 conveyance" option is "code" for the"California WaterFix" ("WaterFix") that DWR had already
19 approved on July 21, 2017. It is a massive 30-mile long pair of "twin tunnels" each some 40 feet in
20 diameter, and three additional intake tunnels aggregating another 15 miles, for an overall length of 45
21 |miles, that would divert most of the Sacramento River's flow underneath the Delta for export. (BDCP/
22 WaterFix FEIR/S Chapter 3 at 3-89 through 3-93, 3-111 through 3-112, esp. Table 3-17 on p. 3-91.) At
23 partial capacity it would divert up to 9,000 cubic feet per second ("cfs") - about 6.5 million acre-feet per
24 ycar, sufficient to flood the entire state of Rhode Island under nearly 7 feet of water -- from the
25 Sacramento River to Clifton Court Forebay for export south. Diverting this staggering quantity of water
26 would exacerbate the Delta's ecologic decline, rather than "restore the Delta ecosystem" as the
27 Legislature commanded. (Water Code 85020(c).). If utilized to its maximum hydraulic capacity, it could
28 |divert up to 15,000 cfs, or more than 8.1 million acre feet per year.

38. The DPA's accommodation of this gargantuan diversion scheme flies in the face of the
2. Legislature's declared intent through the Delta Reform Act "to reduce reliance on the Delta in meeting
3 California's future water supply needs" by improving "regional self-reliance." (Water Code § 85021
4 (emphasis added).) By promoting DWR's massive new conveyance infrastructure, the Delta Plan ensures
5 that water users south of the Delta will not pursue regional self-reliance, and the Delta will continue to
6 deteriorate as excessive quantities of fresh water are unsustainably siphoned off.

7 39. The twin-tunnel WaterFix previously approved by DWR and promoted by the DPA would
8 be extraordinarily cost-inefficient - the only peer reviewed cost-benefit analysis of the WaterFix
9 estimated that it would cost $2.50 for every $1.00 in benefits. The bulk of the burden would fall upon
10 taxpayers, urban water ratepayers, and the natural environment, while large agribusiness would reap most
11 of the benefits.

12 40. As noted above, despite the Superior Court's Ruling setting aside the 2013 Delta Plan
13 because it violated the Delta Reform Act, the Council has acted as if the Court had not vacated the 2013
14 Delta Plan and as though the plainly deficient 2013 PEIR were instead sufficient. These "business as
15 usual" assumptions animate the entire Draft PEIR. The Council's concerted effort to ignore the Court's
16 Ruling overturning the 2013 Delta Plan as unlawful, and the Council's apparent disregard of the profound
17 errors and omissions in that Plan's Program Environmental Impact Report ("2013 PEIR"), must be
18 addressed and corrected before the Council may lawfully proceed further with revisions to the Delta Plan.

19 41. Because the Sacramento Superior Court ruled that the 2013 Delta Plan violated the Delta
20 Reform Act, the Court did not reach petitioners' detailed challenges under CEQA to the sufficiency of the
21 2013 PEIR prepared to support the Delta Plan. The Court's Judgment, however, expressly "preserved"
22 these challenges. (Judgment in North Coast Rivers Alliance V. Delta Stewardship Council, JCCP No.
23 4758 filed October 21, 2016, at 3 T8.) To the extent the Council now relies on the 2013 PEIR to
24 document its CEQA compliance for its invalid 2013 Delta Plan, petitioners reallege, reassert and
25 expressly incorporate their prior and expressly preserved challenges to that 2013 PEIR within this
26 Verified Petition.

1 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Violation of CEQA for Inadequate Environmental Review)

3 (Alleged by All Petitioners Against All Respondents)

4 42. The paragraphs set forth above are realleged and incorporated herein by reference.

5 43. Petitioners bring this First Cause of Action pursuant to PRC sections 21168 and 21168.5,
6 on the grounds that the Council committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion, by failing to proceed in the
7 manner required by law, in approving a deeply flawed DPA based on a legally inadequate PEIR.

8 44. CEQA requires public agencies to conduct environmental review prior to approving any
9 |project that may have a significant impact on the environment. (PRC §§ 21002.1, 21061, 21100, 21151;
10 Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14 (CEQA Guidelines or "Guidelines") § 15004(a).) The Council is a "public
11 lagency" within the meaning of CEQA. (PRC § 21063.) The Council's actions in approving and carrying
12 |out the Delta Plan are subject to the requirements of CEQA.

13 45. The purpose of an EIR is to provide agencies and the public with information about a
14 proposed project's potential environmental effects, ways to minimize those effects, and potential
15 alternatives to the project. (PRC § 21061.) The EIR must "include a detailed statement" describing, inter
16 alia, all of the proposed project's significant effects on the environment, alternatives to the project, and
17 potential mitigation measures. (PRC § 21100(b).)
18 46. A program EIR may be prepared for a related "series of actions that can be characterized
19 as one large project." (Guidelines § 15168(a).) Program EIRs are useful because they allow the agency
20 Ito (1) provide "a more exhaustive consideration of effects and alternatives than would be practical in an
21 EIR on an individual action"; (2) ensure full consideration of cumulative impacts; (3) avoid "duplicative"
22 analysis of "basic policy considerations"; and (4) consider "broad policy alternatives and program wide
23 mitigation measures" when the agency still has the greatest "flexibility to deal with basic problems or
24 |cumulative impacts." (PRC § 15168(b).) Program EIRs, however, must still meet all of the content
25 requirements of CEQA and its Guidelines. (Guidelines §§ 15160, 15120-15132.)

26 The PEIR Impermissibly Relies on the Council's Previous Unlawful Conduct.

27 47. Despite the Superior Court's Ruling setting aside the 2013 Delta Plan because it violates
28 the Delta Reform Act, and despite petitioners' meritorious challenges to the adequacy of the 2013 PEIR

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR 'DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES - 13 -

1 which were expressly "preserved" by the Superior Court's Judgment for future adjudication, the Council
2 repeatedly relies upon the 2013 PEIR as if it and the 2013 Delta Plan were lawful. For example, the Draft
3 PEIR adopts the 2013 PEIR's mitigation measures as sufficient for almost all impacts of the Delta Plan
4 Amendments. (ES-25 to ES-112 (Tables ES-3, ES-4, ES- 25), 5.1-9 to 5.1-10 (agencies implementing
5 covered actions under Proposed Plan Amendments to implement 2013 PEIR mitigation measures), 5.1-
6 18, 5.1-19, 5.1-20, 5.1-28 to 5.1-31 (reliance on 2013 PEIR mitigation measures to reduce impacts of
7 Proposed Plan Amendments), 5.2-36 to 5.2-37 (same regarding aesthetic impacts), 5.2-42 to 5.2-43
8 (same), 5.3-27 to 5.3-45 (same regarding agricultural and forestry resources), 5.4-39 to 5.4-81 (same for
9 air quality and greephouse-gas emissions), 5.5-65 to 5.5-81 (same for aquatic biological resources), 5.6-
10 87 to 5.6-121 (same for terrestrial biological resources), 5.7-53 to 5.7-73 (same for cultural and
11 paleontological resources), 5.9-52 to 5.9-85 (same for geology, soils, seismicity and minerals resources),
12 5.10-38 to 5.10-65 (same for hazards and hazardous materials), 5.11-192 to 5.11-240 (same for hydrology
13 land water quality), 5.12-24 to 5.12-34 (same for land use and planning), 5.13-21 to 5.13-43 (same for
14 noise), 5.14-18 (same for population, employment and housing), 5.15-23 to 5.15-39 (same for recreation),
15 5.16-35 to 5.16-59 (same for transportation, traffic and circulation), 5.17-13 to 5.17-16 (same for tribal
16 cultural resources), 5.18-38 to 5.18-48 (same for utilities and public services), 7-8 to 7-43 (same for
17 |cumulative impacts), Chapter 9 generally (applying same 2013 PEIR mitigation measures for no project
18 alternative, and Altemnatives 1 to to the Proposed Plan Amendments).)

19 48. The Draft PEIR relies upon the 2013 PEIR's mitigation measures even where the Delta
20 Plan Amendments would have potentially significant unmitigable impacts - a plain violation of CEQA.
21 (See, e.g., Tables ES-3 to ES-5.) Indeed, the Draft PEIR includes only one new mitigation measure,
22 Measure 5.2-1, which "is recommended for projects in the Primary and Extending Planning Areas" to
23 reduce glare impacts of transmission and distribution lines to less than significant. (Id. at 5.2-42.) This
24 measure, however, is a mere recommendation rather than a requirement, and thus violates CEQA'S
25 mandate that "[m]itigation measures must be fully enforceable." (Guidelines § 15126.4(a)(2).)

26 49. In all other instances, instead of evaluating whether additional mitigation measures exist
27 that could minimize these potentially significant impacts, the Council merely states that "no new
28 mitigation measures are required because previously adopted 2013 PEIR Mitigation Measures would

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES • 14 -

1 lapply to covered and non-covered actions in both the Primary and Extended Planning Areas." (E.g., id. at
2 5.2-31 (and 63 other instances in Chapter 5).) The Council's rote reliance on the 2013 PEIR sidesteps its
3 duty to "use its best efforts" to ascertain whether feasible mitigation for the DPA's otherwise significant
4 impacts may exist. (Guidelines §§ 15126.4, 15144.) It also subjects the Council to petitioners'
5 previously alleged and expressly preserved challenges to the adequacy of the Council's 2013 PEIR.

6 The Objectives Unreasonably Narrow the Focus of the PEIR

7 50. The Draft PEIR posits an objective of new or improved Delta conveyance infrastructure
8 that can, among other things, adapt to changing conditions, and increase the reliability of water available
9 for export supplies, arguing that this is required under the Delta Reform Act. (Id. at ES-5.) But the Delta
10 | Reform Act requires instead that the Delta Plan "promote options for new and improved infrastructure
11 |relating to the water conveyance in the Delta, storage systems, and for the operation of both to achieve the
12 coequal goals." (Water Code § 86304 (emphasis added).) By creating an objective that requires
13 (increased reliability of water available for exports, the Council has set a goal that is counter to the Delta
14 Reform Act's co-equal goals of reducing Delta exports while increasing the reliability of water supplies.

15 51. The Council then doubles down on this improper objective by claiming that it justifies
16 Idismissal from consideration of alternatives that would achieve the Delta Reform Act's co-equal goal of
17 restoring the Delta's natural flows and repairing its degraded ecosystem by reducing exports. (Water
18 Code §§ 85020(c), 85021; PEIR at ES-5 to ES-7, 9-1 to 9-29.)

19 52. The DPA and its PEIR fail to consider alternatives that would substantially reduce export
20 levels. The DPA calls for "statistically significant" decreases in annual exports only in critically dry
21 years, but at the same time, it calls for "statistically significant" increases in exports during wet years.
22 (PEIR, Appendix C, Attachment C-5 at E-3.) The "fifteen-year average total exports during all year
23 Itypes" are to "decrease by 5 percent or more from the average historical deliveries for the years 2000-
24 2014." (Id.) These goals are to be met by 2030. (Id.) The performance measures do not address what
25 occurs when these targets conflict. (Id.) By limiting reductions in exports to critically dry years, the
26 Council is not proposing sufficient change to reduce reliance upon the Delta as compared to existing
27 operations. To the contrary, when long-term water needs are developed based on water deliveries that are
28 possible only during the wettest of years, the entire system is over allocated. The only way for water

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR 'DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES - 15 -

1 exporters to consistently reduce reliance upon the Delta is for water exporters to consistently - rather than
2 merely occasionally - receive less water. Because the DPA performance measures set a target of
3 increased Delta exports except in critically dry years, they fail to comply with the coequal goals, and the
4 PEIR violates CEQA's mandate for consideration of a reasonable range of alternatives.

5 53. The PEIR's "Alternative 1" takes only a tiny step where a substantial reduction is required
6 to reverse the Delta's ecological nose dive. It would only require a 5 percent decrease in Delta exports in
7 below normal, dry, and critically dry years, a 10 percent decrease in monthly exports during the months of
8 July, August, and September (to be achieved by 2030) and a 10-year average total reduction by 2040 for
9 all water year types. (Id. at 9-24.) The performance measures included in Alternative 1 - albeit
10 insufficient to restore the Delta - would at least be more effective than the DPA in meeting the target of
11 reduced reliance upon the Delta. Yet perversely, the Draft PEIR determined that because of this modest
12 reduction in exports, Alternative 1 does not achieve the Project Objectives relating to reliability or
13 conveyance. (Id. at 9-29.) The illogic of this reasoning is palpable. It directly defies the Delta Reform
14 Act's overarching objective of reducing Delta exports in order to restore the Delta's natural flows and
15 thereby repair its degraded ecosystem, and violates CEQA's imperative that a reasonable range of
16 alternatives be considered. This violates CEQA's mandate that an EIR must analyze a "range of
17 reasonable alternatives that would feasibly attain most of the basic objectives of the project but would
18 avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the project." (Guidelines § 15126.6(a).)

19 The Draft PEIR Improperly Favors the WaterFix at the Expense of Reasonable and

20 Feasible Alternatives That Can Meet the Coequal Goals

21 54. The Delta Reform Act invests the Council with responsibility to adopt a Delta Plan that
22 will reverse the ongoing collapse of the Delta ecosystem while making California's water supplies more
23 reliable. "Covered actions" will be evaluated for consistency with the Delta Plan. (Water Code §§
24 85057.5(a), 85225.) The WaterFix is a "covered action" that must be evaluated for consistency with the
25 Delta Plan. (Id.) The Delta Plan must be written to meet the goals of the Delta Reform Act, rather than
26 (reverse-engineered - as is the case with the DPA - to conform to the WaterFix and its unlawful goal of
27 (maintaining excessive Delta exports.

28 55. The WaterFix will have the capacity to divert at least 3,000 cfs through each of three

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR "DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES . 16 -

1 separate intakes, for a total of 9,000 cfs. (WaterFix Final EIR/EIS V.II, Response to Comment
2 DEIR/DEIS 84, Comment 16.) This translates to an export rate of more than 6.5 million acre feet per
3 year.' The south-of-Delta water districts that receive Delta exports expect that the WaterFix will deliver
year, and under Performance Measure 3.9, the target 2030 export amount is 4 4.9 million acre feet per
5 (nearly the same, 4.845 million acre feet per year. (PEIR at 4-21, Appendix C, Attachment C-5 at E-4.)

6 56. The Council's apparent agenda to design its DPA. in a manner that accommodates the
7 WaterFix is directly contrary to the Delta Reform Act. (PEIR at ES-5 to ES-7, 9-1 to 9-29.) That Act
8 mandates just the opposite - that the Council adopt a Plan that reverses the Delta's ecologic decline by
9 |forcing agencies to reduce their reliance on Delta exports. The Council should require exporters such as
10 DWR to conform to a Delta Plan that restores the Delta rather than, instead, adopt a Delta Plan (or a
11 DPA) that allows them to continue or even expand their excessive exports. The Council's contrary
12 approach with its DPA undermines rather than advances the purposes of the Delta Reform Act to
13 "reform" past harmful practices of excessive exports that have pushed the Delta's ecology to the brink of
14 collapse. This violates CEQA's requirement that "ft]he EIR shall discuss the inconsistencies between the
15 proposed project and applicable . . . regional plans." (Guidelines § 15125(d).)

16 57. The harm done to the CEQA process by ignoring the WaterFix's inconsistency with the
17 Delta Plan's statutory mandate to reverse rather than exacerbate its ecologic collapse is profound. As
18 shown above, the Council dismissed from consideration alternatives that would substantially reduce the
19  existing, completely unsustainable rate of export, and even rejected Alternative 1's very modest export
20 reductions. The "dual conveyance" option the Council adopted would maintain and exacerbate the
21 existing harmful rates of excessive export, and thereby create internal inconsistencies within the Delta

22 Plan.

23 58. Courts have rejected : similar subterfuge in the analogous context of a county's or city's
24 levasion of its general plan standards by weakening them to allow an inconsistent project. Plan
25 amendments that create inconsistencies with the rest of the plan are set aside. (See, e.g., Sierra Club v.

26

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND IN) UNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES - 17 -

1 Kern County Board of Supervisors (1981) 126 Cal.App.3d 698, 704.) The reason for this rule is
2 simple: it is impossible to find the amendments and the "covered actions" such as the WaterFix they are
3 intended to allow consistent - as the Delta Reform Act requires - with an internally inconsistent plan. As

4 the Court in Sierra Club explained, if a general plan is rendered "internally inconsistent," then the project
5 in question "could not be consistent with such plan and [therefore] was invalid" when approved. (Id.,
6 126 Cal.App.3d at 704.) Like the Planning and Zoning Law at issue in Sierra Club, the Delta Reform Act
7 similarly requires plan consistency. (Water Code §§ 85057.5(a), 85225.) Therefore the Council's
8 attempted approval of the Delta Plan Amendments that create inconsistencies with the rest of the Plan --
9 and the Delta Reform Act to boot - is unlawful.

10 59. The Council's gambit to allow the WaterFix "tail" to wage the Delta Plan "dog" does not
11 merely violate its CEQA duty to avoid projects that create undisclosed plan inconsistencies. It also
12 violates, as shown above, its CEQA duty to consider a reasonable range of alternatives that are capable of
13 meeting the goals of the Delta Reform Act while lessening the impacts of the WaterFix, including the
14 impacts of its construction and massive diversions. (Habitat and Watershed Caretakers v. City of Santa
15 |Cruz (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 1277, 1301-1305; CEQA Guidelines § 15126.6(a).) Because the DPA
16 adopts specific goals that will be used to evaluate the WaterFix's consistency with the Delta Plan, the
17 Council's failure to ensure that those amendments are consistent with both of the coequal goals violates
18 both its CEQA duty to disclose inconsistencies with required plans and the Delta Reform Act itself.
19 (Water Code § 85054.) The DPA and its PEIR fail to analyze, let alone demonstrate, this required
20 consistency.

21 60. Contrary to the Council's statutory duty to evaluate the WaterFix for consistency with the
22 Delta Plan, the Council's PEIR and DPA instead treat the WaterFix as if it were the action that must be
23 accommodated by the subordinate Delta Plan. For this reason, the PEIR rejects Alternative 1 as not
24 "fully achiev[ing] any of the conveyance-related objectives" of the project. (Id. at 9-29.) Similarly, the
25 PEIR likewise rejects Alternatives 2 and 3 as only "partially achiev[ing] [or "contribut[ing] to"] many of
26 the CSO (Conveyance, Storage Systems and Operation of Both] Amendment objectives." (Id. at 9-35, 9-
27 41.) By configuring the DPA's objectives to accommodate the WaterFix, rather than the other way
28 around - and without explicitly acknowledging its improper inversion of the plan consistency

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES 18 -

1 requirement - the Council has turned both the Delta Reform Act and CEQA on their respective heads.

2 The Project Description Is Inadequate

3 61. An EIR must contain a project description including "the project's technical, economic,
4 land environmental characteristics." (Guidelines § 15124(c).) The "project" for CEQA purposes is "the
5 whole of an action" potentially causing direct or indirect "physical change in the environment." (Id. at §
6 15378(a).)

7 62. "[A]n accurate, stable and finite project description is the sine qua non of an informative

8 and legally sufficient EIR," while a "curtailed, enigmatic or unstable project description" is unacceptable.
9 (County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 197-199 ("County of Inyo");
10 Guidelines § 15124.) A clear and accurate picture of the project is required in order for agencies and the
11 public to "balance the proposed project's benefits against its environmental cost, consider appropriate
12 mitigation measures," and assess potential alternatives. (City of Santee v. County of San Diego (1989)
13 214 Cal.App.3d 1438, 1454.)

14 63. The PEIR states that the "project" here "consists of three proposed amendments to the

15 Delta Plan . [the] Delta Levee Investment and Risk Reduction Strategy Amendment[,] . . . . [the]
16 Conveyance, Storage Systems, and the Operation of Both Amendment[] . ... [and the] Perfonmance
17 Measures Amendment...." (PEIR ES 10-ES 11.) However, the whole of the "project" necessarily
18 includes all components of the legislatively mandated "fundamental reorganization of the state's
19 management of Delta watershed resources" that the Delta Plan is being proposed to achieve. (Water
20 Code § 85001(a).) Contrary to CEQA, the PEIR fails to address the entirety of the project that is being
21 approved. Indeed, the vague project description for the DPA is precisely the type of "enigmatic"
22 |description that was condemned in County of Inyo. (County of Inyo, 71 Cal.App.3d at 199.)

23 64. Instead of actually describing each of the three Plan Amendments, the "Project
24 Description" in the PEIR provides only a cryptic, generic reference to each of them. The entire
25description" occupies just 18 lines of text. (PEIR at 3-1.) In order to ascertain what is actually
26 /proposed, the reader must examine hundreds of pages scattered throughout several chapters and
27 lappendices, thwarting informed public review and understanding of the DPA Project. For example,
28 Chapter 3.4 reveals that the DPA directs that DWR, Reclamation and other agencies "should pursue" a

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES 19 -

1 "dual conveyance option for the Delta." (PEIR at 3-18.) However, no specific description of the "dual
2 conveyance option" that is in fact being promoted is provided in this Chapter. Instead, the reader is
3 exposed to a series of broad, imprecise directives that tangentially suggest certain features of such a "dual
4 conveyance" option, without actually providing any concrete information. This exercise is needlessly
5 Jconfusing, in view of the fact that the DPA's underlying purpose is simply to anoint the WaterFix already
6 approved by DWR in July, 2017.

7 65. Instead of providing a specific description of the WaterFix, the PEIR dissembles,
8 repeatedly denying that the "Proposed Project" has any specific parameters. Chapter 4.3.1 of the PEIR,
9 for example, tells the reader what the "Proposed Project" does not do, rather than what it would do. This
10 Chapter states that "[t]he Proposed Project does not direct the construction of specific projects, nor would
11 projects be implemented under the direct authority of the Council." (PEIR at 4-7.) The reader is then
12 treated to a series of generalized descriptions of what kinds of "general types of activities" the Proposed
13 Project might entail, again without any specific parameters sufficient to afford the reader with enough
14 information to grasp what is specifically being proposed and approved. (PEIR at 4-7 to 4-16.) Even if
15 the enterprising reader digs into Appendix C-styled "Text of Proposed Delta Plan Amendments" - and
16 reviews, for example, Section 3 thereof regarding "Conveyance, Storage Systems and the Operation of
17 Both," the reader is subjected to the daunting task of working through hundreds of pages of various drafts
18 and edits of drafts of arcane subject matter regarding an admixture of nearly poignant platitudes and
19 incomprehensible terminology. (PEIR, Appendix C, Section 3, at 3-1 and pages following.)
20 Conspicuously absent is the straightforward and understandable description CEQA requires.

21 66. Contrary to CEQA's core mandate to inform the public of the DPA's impacts on the
22 environment, the actual policies and recommendations that comprise the DPA are buried and scattered
23 throughout hundreds of pages of disjointed and, in places, unintelligible text, charts, maps, proposed,
24 revised, interlineated and disorganized materials. (Id.) Worse, these hidden and cryptic policies are rife
25 with contradictions and conundrums. Policies are enforceable, but only with respect to "covered actions,"
26 while recommendations are not enforceable but "essential." (PEIR at 2-4.) To determine whether a given
27 project would be a "covered action," the reader must refer to other sections of the PEIR or to the Delta
28 Act itself. (Id. at 2-5 to 2-9.)

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR 'DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES - 20 -

1 67. Spreading a project description across multiple chapters and hiding the basic elements of
2 the proposed action in appendices is impermissible. (San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Center v. County of
3 Merced (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 645, 659 ("decision makers and [the] general public should not be forced

4 to sift through obscure minutiae or appendices in order to ferret out" fundamental aspects of the project's
5 description); Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. v. City of Rancho Cordova (2007) 40
6 Cal.4th 412, 442 ("Vineyard") (*"[I]nformation "scattered here and there in EIR appendices," or a report
7 buried in an appendix," is not a substitute for "a good faith reasoned analysis". . . .'').) The PEIR's
8 fractured, cryptic and muddled project description firustrates CEQA's goal of making the agency's
9 decisionmaking accessible to the public. (Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of
10 California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392.)

11 The PEIR's Discussion of Purpose and Objectives Is Too Vague

12 68. CEQA requires that the project description provide a "statement of the objectives sought
13 by the proposed project," including "the underlying purpose of the project." (Guidelines § 15124(b).)
14 Clear objectives "help the lead agency develop a reasonable range of alternatives to evaluate" and "help
15 the agency prepare its findings or statement of overriding considerations." (Id.)

16 69. The PEIR's statement of purpose and objectives is anything but clear. (PEIR at 3-1 to 3-
17 6.) Literally dozens of competing objectives are simply listed without any guide as to priorities, timing,
18  and sequencing. (Id.) Although some criteria for performance measures are provided, they are so general
19 and unfocused as to be unusable. (Id.) Consequently, the reader is left without sufficient detail, let alone
20 a coherent narrative, with which to gain an understanding of what is being proposed. (Id.) This verbiage
21 levades informed understanding and therefore proves unhelpful in the evaluation of alternatives that are
22 intended to achieve the DPA's goals.

23 The PEIR's Discussion of the Plan's Impacts Is Incomplete

24 70. "The fundamental purpose of an EIR is 'to provide public agencies and the public in

25 Igeneral with detailed information about"" a proposed project's environmental effects. (Vineyard, 40
26 Cal.4th at 428.) Therefore, CEQA requires that an EIR disclose and analyze all potential significant
27 environmental impacts of a proposed project. (PRC § 21100(b)(1); Guidelines § 15126.2.) The agency
28 must make a "good faith effort at full disclosure" of both short- and long-term direct, reasonably

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIER AND ATTORNEYS' FEES - 21 -

foreseeable indirect, and cumulative effects of the proposed project. (Guidelines §§ 15064(d), 15126.2,
2 15151.)

3 71. The PEIR's discussion of the Project's environmental impacts fails to do so. (PEIR at 5.1-
4 1 to 5.18-48.) It is far too vague, generalized and abstract to permit informed public review; it defers too
5 much analysis to later, project-specific environmental reviews; it fails to fully analyze the effects of the
6 WaterFix on cach of the competing beneficial uses of water; it fails to fully discuss the presence and
7 impact of invasive species; and it ignores potential effects of the Project on all of its source watersheds •
8 including the Trinity River watershed - and the threatened salmon and other species that depend on them.
9 72. Throughout the PEIR's discussion of impacts, vagueness and abstraction preclude
10 effective analysis. (Id.) The PEIR speaks in such broad terms that it is impossible for the public to
11 discern and analyze the Project's environmental effects. For example, rather than "conduct detailed
12 modeling analysis of the Proposed Project," the PEIR instead attempted to "identify and review existing
13 environmental studies, data, model results, and other information for projects that are consistent with
14 those identified in Chapter 4 General Types of Activities, Potential Projects, and Construction Methods
15 That Could Result with Implementation of the Proposed Delta Plan Amendments." (PEIR at 5.4-28.)

16 73. The Council's excuse for not examining the actual, foreseeable impacts of the WaterFix
17 was that "specific project details are unknown and identifying a set of assumptions that realistically
18 represents how the Proposed Project could be implemented (i.e., constructed and operated) is extremely
19 Idifficult . . . .)." (Id.) But in fact, the Council is fully conversant with the fact that the WaterFix is the
20 "Proposed Project". or, at least, the principal feature of the "Proposed Project" - and, since it was
21 already approved in July, 2017 and was subject to its own CEQA analysis at that time, the Council could
22 have engaged in the required CEQA analysis based on the information provided for the WaterFix in its
23 own CEQA review. Indeed, the Council admits that this information was available in "[t]he Final
24 EIR/EIS for the BDCP/California WaterFix Project (DWR and Reclamation 2016a) [which] describes the
25 limpacts associated with the California WaterFix .. " (Final PEIR at 3-9.) Instead of providing this
26 information in the PEIR, the Council embarked on a vague, confusing, and ultimately, misleading and
27 useless attempted examination of "existing environmental studies, data, model results, and other
28 information for projects that are consistent with those identified in [PEIR] Chapter 4." (Id.) As a

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES 22 -

1 consequence, the public was left with no clear understanding of the anticipated impacts of the DPA.

2 74. generality of the PEIR's purported "analysis" of the DPA's impacts precludes the The very
3 informed consideration of alternatives that CEQA requires. "The failure to provide enough information
4 to permit informed decision-making is fatal. "When the informational requirements of CEQA are not
5 complied with, an agency has failed to proceed in a manner required by law and has therefore abused its
6 discretion." (Napa Citizens for Honest Government v. Napa County Board of Supervisors (2001) 91
7 Cal.App.4th 342, 361, quoting Save Our Peninsula Committee v. Monterey County Board of Supervisors
8 (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 99, 118, additional citations omitted.)

9 75. The PEIR impermissibly defers all specific analysis of the environmental impacts of
10 projects implementing the DPA even though those projects are foreseeable and, indeed, an indispensable
11 part of the DPA itself. Just because the PEIR purports to tier its environmental analysis "does not excuse
12  the lead agency from adequately analyzing reasonably foreseeable significant environmental effects of the
13 project and does not justify deferring such analysis to a later tier EIR." (Guidelines § 15152(b).)
14 Therefore, lead agencies must not defer analysis of significant environmental effects if that analysis can,
15 as here, feasibly be undertaken for the implementing actions in question. (EPIC v. California Dept. of
16 Forestry and Fire Protection (2008) 44 Cal.4th 459, 502-03; Guidelines § 15151 ("the sufficiency of an
17 EIR is to be reviewed in the light of what is reasonably feasible").)

18 The Council Failed to Fully Consider All Feasible Alternatives to the Plan and the PEIR's Mitigations Measures Are Vague, Lack Quantifiable Criteria, and Are Unenforceable
19

20 76. CEQA requires an EIR to "include sufficient information about each alternative to allow
21 meaningful evaluation, analysis, and comparison with the proposed project." (Guidelines § 15126.6(d).)
22 Agencies must prevent "significant, avoidable damage to the environment" through the use of feasible
23 alternatives or mitigation measures. (Guidelines § 15002(a)(3); PRC § § 21002, 21002.1, 21081.) Project
24 approval should be withheld where such measures or alternatives exist, but are, as here, ignored.
25 (Guidelines § 15021(a)(2).) An EIR's discussion of proposed mitigation measures must be sufficiently
26 specific to enable the public to evaluate and comment upon the adequacy of the alternatives and
27 mitigation measures. (Endangered Habitats League, Inc. v. County of Orange (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th
28 777, 794.)

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES - 23 -

1 77. The mitigation measures and alternatives in the PEIR and Monitoring and Reporting
2 Program are also inadequate because they contain only vague approximations of the significant impacts
3 that will result from implementation of the DPA, are themselves vague and so malleable as to be illusory,
4 do not constitute mitigation or alternatives as defined under CEQA and its implementing Guidelines, and
5 improperly defer consideration without specific implementing standards. (PRC §§ 21100(b)(3) and (4);
6 Guidelines §§ 15126(e) and (f), 15126.4, 15126.6, 15370.) CEQA requires much more than the vague
7 and unenforceable recommendations that the PEIR proffers. (Guidelines §§ 15144, 15151; Kings County
8 Farm Bureau v. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 727-728.)

9 78. The PEIR considered four alternatives: No Project, Alternative 1 (Reduced Reliance on
10 the Delta Emphasis), Altermative 2 (Delta Wetland Restoration Emphasis), and Alternative 3 (Through-
11 Delta Conveyance Emphasis). Each of these altematives is flawed in significant respects, as summarized
12 below.

13 79. The No Project Alternative incorrectly posits retention of the existing, unlawful Delta
14 Plan. (PEIR at 9-17.) Since the 2013 Delta Plan was declared "invalid" and set aside by Judge Kenny in
15 2016, it is of no further force and effect and the Council may not attempt to resurrect this unlawful plan in
16 the guise of a "No Project Alternative." Instead, the PEIR should have complied with the CEQA
17 Guidelines. They direct that "[tJhe 'no project' analysis shall discuss the existing conditions at the time
18 the notice of preparation is published .. as well as what would be reasonably expected to occur in the
19 foreseeable future if the project were not approved . . .." (Guidelines § 15126.6(e)(2).) The Council
20 published its Notice of Preparation on March 16, 2017 - 10 months after Judge Kenny had issued his
21 Ruling declaring the 2013 Delta Plan unlawful on May 18, 2016, 9 months after Judge Kenny had issued
22 his Clarification Order declaring the Plan "invalid" on June 24, 2016, and 5 months after Judge Kenny
23 had entered Judgment on October 21, 2016 confirming those rulings. Therefore the Council could not
24 lawfully define its "No Action Alternative" as the unlawful, invalid and previously set aside 2013 Delta
25 Plan.

26 80. Altemative 1 - Reduced Reliance on the Delta Emphasis is inadequate because it does
27 Little to reduce the existing excessive level of exports of fresh water from the Delta. As noted above,
28 Alternative 1 takes only a tiny step toward the substantial export reductions that are necessary to halt the

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
"DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES 24 -

1 Delta's free fall into ecological oblivion. Yet the Delta Reform Act makes clear the Legislature's intent
2 that the ecological "crisis" in the Delta be reversed, by "restoring more natural flows" through the Delta.
3 Alternative 1 does nothing specifically to "restore more natural flows," and requires only insubstantial

4 reductions in export levels 5 percent in below normal, dry and critically dry years when the Delta's
5 flows are most in need of restoration. (PEIR at 9-24.) Therefore it does not provide by itself a reasonable
alternatives intended to achieve the Delta Reform Act's purposes. 6  range of

7 81. Alternative 2 - Delta Wetland Restoration Emphasis -- likewise fails to provide sufficient
8 restoration of "natural flows" through the Delta. It would increase the average Delta outflow-inflow ratio

9 in dry and critically dry years to just 0.6 (compared to 0.5 for the Proposed Project) to be achieved by
10 2030 (PEIR at 9-31) and increase the native inshore fish community only percentage points more than
11 the Proposed Project - the DPA (id.). For this reason, Alternative 2, like Alternative 1, does not represent
12  a reasonable range of alternatives that reduce the DPA's environmental impacts consistent with achieving
13 the Delta Reform Act's purposes of restoring the Delta's "natural flows" to historic conditions, let alone
14 recovering its ecological health including natural fish populations.

15 82. Alternative 3 - Through-Delta Conveyance Emphasis - like Alternatives 1 and 2, fails to
16 provide for restoration of "natural flows" through the Delta. Instead, it would "focus[] on improvements
17 to water conveyance through the Delta .. that would modify existing water conveyance infrastructure
18 and construct new water conveyance infrastructure, and develop additional ground water and surface
19 water storage." (PEIR at 9-36.) Consequently, it likewise fails to provide a reasonable range of
20 alternatives that would feasibly reduce the DPA's impacts, as required by CEQA, and fails to achieve the
21 Delta Reform Act's statutory mandates for restoration of the Delta.

22 83. Because none of its alternatives substantially reduce the existing level of excessive
23 exports, and none restore the Delta's "natural flows," the PEIR failed to analyze a reasonable range of
24 alternatives as CEQA requires.

25 84. The PEIR failed to prepare and analyze mitigation measures to address the Project's
26 myriad significant impacts. Instead, the PEIR presented only vague descriptions of potential mitigation
27 lineasures. Rather than analyzing new measures designed to address the specific impacts of the DPA (and
28 WaterFix), the PEIR merely copied the 2013 PEIR's deficient mitigation measures, which were

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR "DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES .25 -

1 developed for a different project under different environmental conditions, and never tied them to specific
2 project impacts of the DPA. (PEIR at ES-25 to ES-112.) Nor did it evaluate, let alone demonstrate, their
3 efficacy. (Id.) Because the PEIR fails to accurately identify and analyze the DPA's substantial impacts
4  on the Delta's natural flows - let alone its more nuanced impacts on fish and wildlife populations and
5 health it fails to mitigate those impacts adequately.

6 85. The Delta Reform Act requires the Delta Plan to be a legally enforceable, "long term"
7 management plan for the Delta. (Water Code § 85020(a).) Yet the Council failed to adequately consider

8 the long-term environmental impacts of the planned construction of a Delta freshwater conveyance
9 facility of the magnitude contemplated in the very WaterFix that the DPA was clearly designed to allow.
10| The failure to consider a reasonable range of alternatives to such a massive diversion facility, or to
11 consider what mitigation measures might be feasible to reduce or avoid its foresecable impacts, violates
12 the Council's CEQA duty to consider alternatives and mitigation measures that would avoid or reduce the
13 Project's significant impacts.

14 86. The No Project Alternative and the Council's description of existing conditions do not
15 adequately describe potentially catastrophic impacts to fish populations if the status quo continues. They
16 also fail to adequately describe the consequences or likelihood of a failure to meet water quality
17 standards. The No Project Alternative "must be straightforward and intelligible, assisting the decision
18 maker and the public in ascertaining the environmental consequences of doing nothing." (Planning
19 Conservation League v. Department of Water Resources (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 892, 911.) Like the rest
20 of the alternatives, the No Project Alternative is tainted to prevent informed decisionmaking.

21 87. The PEIR's discussion of alternatives and mitigation measures also fails to meet CEQA's
due to the Council's overall failure to produce a CEQA document that coherently analyzes 22 requirements
23 the policies and actions contemplated by the Delta Plan Amendments. The PEIR's vague discussion of
24 the DPA's project purpose and objectives, lack of an effective project description, and incomplete
25 impacts analysis makes the promulgation of effective, concrete mitigation measures and alternatives
26  virtually impossible.

27 The PEIR Lacks an Adequate Cumulative Impacts Assessment

28 88. An EIR must discuss cumulative impacts when a "project's incremental effect is

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR 'DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES - 26 -

1 cumulatively considerable." (Guidelines § 15130(a).) A "cumulative impact" refers to "two or more
2 individual effects which, when considered together, are considerable or which compound or increase
3 lother environmental impacts." (Guidelines § 15355.) § "Cumulative impacts can result from individually
4 (minor but collectively significant projects taking place over a period of time." (Guidelines § 15355(b).)
5 The cumulative impacts discussion must include either a "list of past, present, and probable future
6 projects producing related or cumulative impacts," or "a summary of projections contained in an adopted"
7 broader plan "that describes or evaluates the conditions contributing to the cumulative effect.3
8 (Guidelines § 15130(b).) "The Agency must interpret this requirement in such a way as to 'afford the
9 fullest possible protection of the environment." (Friends of the Eel River v. Sonoma County Water
10 Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 859, 868-869, quoting Citizens Assn. for Sensible Development of Bishop
11 Area v. County of Inyo (1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 151, 168.)

12 89. Contrary to these requirements, the PEIR fails to adequately assess the Project's
13 cumulative impacts. (PEIR at 7-1 to 7-43.) First, because the PEIR's analysis of the DPA's impacts is
14 too vague to be useful, its similarly vague cumulative impacts analysis is necessarily inadequate. Without
15 fully describing and analyzing the DPA's impacts, the PEIR could not adequately identify and analyze its
16 cumulative impacts. The cumulative impacts assessment is plagued by meaningless generalities such as:
17 operation of conveyance projects could result in direct impacts on special-status fish

18 species. Operation of these facilities that modify operations of the CVP, SWP, or other water systems, might affect special-status species depending on the extent to which the

19 operation influences the flows in connecting rivers or streams. Changes in water operations could result in impingement or entrainment of special-status fish species.

20 =: *

21 Construction and operation of facilities, such as water intakes and pumping plants, located

22 along waterways could cause long-term or permanent interruptions to migratory fish habitat corridors. Depending on the types of facilities constructed and their operational
23 criteria, operations could block or delay migration or movement of migratory fish species. Alteration of flow patterns and water quality in the Delta or its tributaries could also

24 disrupt migratory cues for these species.

25 |(PEIR at 7-16.) Such vague statements about undefined "changes" that "could" occur "depending on the
26 Itypes of facilities constructed and their operational criteria" are entirely unhelpful.

27 90. Second, the PEIR entirely fails to identify and discuss the potential impacts of the
28 WaterFix and its diversion of 9000 cfs (or more) of water away from the Sacramento River upstream of

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
"DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES • 27 -

1 the Delta. The PEIR does not analyze how these withdrawals will affect upstream reservoir operations, or
2 lhow regulations related to the reservoirs and tunnels will affect Project operations. In Friends of the Eel
3 River (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 859, 871, the court held that the EIR's cumulative impacts discussion was
4 insufficient because it failed to acknowledge that curtailed diversions from the Eel River into the Russian
5 River could cause the Sonoma County Water Agency to fail to "supply water to its customers in an
6 environmentally sound way." Likewise, in County of Amador v. El Dorado County Water Agency (1999)
7 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 953, the court rejected an EIR because it failed to "demonstrate the timing, location
8 and amount of water releases from the upper watershed lakes and analyze the resulting lake levels"
9 occasioned by the downstream water project's proposed diversions. The PEIR's failure to fully
10 acknowledge and discuss the likely effects on operation of upstream reservoirs such as Oroville, Shasta
11 and Trinity of the WaterFix's downstream operations frustrates the public's ability to understand the DPA
12 and its impacts, and has led to an inadequate range of alternatives, as discussed above. These omissions
13 violate CEQA.

14 The EIR Uses the Wrong Baseline

15 91. "To decide whether a given project's environmental effects are likely to be significant, the
16 agency must use some measure of the environment's state absent the project, a measure sometimes
17 referred to as the 'baseline' for environmental analysis." (Communities for a Better Environment v. South a
18 Coast Unified Air Quality Management District (2010) 48 Cal.4th 310, 315 ("CBE').) "Normally" this
19 baseline is the "physical environmental conditions in the vicinity of the project, as they exist at the time
20 the notice of preparation is published," Guidelines section 15125(a), because "normally" the
21 |"environmental condition[] in the vicinity of the project" is "the environment's state absent the project."
22 (Id.; CBE, 48 Cal.4th at 315.)

23 92. Here, by contrast, the Council is not explicitly proposing any specific facilities although,
24 las noted, it has reverse-engineered its review to accommodate the WaterFix. Instead, the PEIR states that
25 "the proposed Delta Plan Amendments (Proposed Project .. .) does not involve construction or operation
26 of specific physical actions following adoption of the proposed amendments." (PEIR at 5.1-1.) The
27 PEIR even claims - ignoring the WaterFix elephant under the rug that "it is difficult to anticipate
28 specific projects that would be implemented as a result of the Proposed Project's policies and

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR "DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES - 28 -

1 recommendations." (Id.) Even if this head-in-the-sand claim were true, it remains the case that the

2 Council is reviewing the continued viability (and impacts) of exporting large volumes of water from the
3 Delta whose removal is devastating the Delta's public trust resources. The Delta Reform Act succinctly
4 acknowledges that the Delta is "in crisis." (Water Code § 85001(a).) As part of its statutory command to
5 restore the Delta's beleaguered environment, the Council had a duty to consider the alternative of
6 reducing the existing high level of Delta water exports to mitigate their environmental impacts. But
7 instead of seizing an obvious opportunity to reduce environmental harm, the Council ignored it.

8 93. The Council's "[f]orfeiture of that opportunity is an action, rather than a perpetuation of
9 the status quo. Put differently, an agency may not escape its duty by ignoring that duty and then
10 presenting the result as a fait accompli incorporated into an environmental baseline." (League to Save
11 Lake Tahoe V. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (B.D.Cal. 2010) 739 F.Supp.2d 1260, 1276 (affirmed in
12 lpart and reversed in part, 469 F.App'x 621 (9th Cir. 2012).) As part of its indisputably broad authority to
13 reconsider the environmental consequences of Delta exports, the Council should have considered those
14 consequences afresh. Instead, the Council ignored all of these impacts by finding them to be part of the
15 CEQA baseline.

16 94. By using a baseline that improperly incorporated the environmental consequences of
17 continuing excessive Delta diversions into the Project, the Council violated CEQA.

18 The EIR Improperly Segments Environmental Review

19 95. CEQA requires agencies to prepare EIRs regarding the impacts of "projects" that may
20 have significant environmental impacts. (Guidelines § 15064(a)(1).) CEQA defines "project" to mean
21 "the whole of an action." (Guidelines § 15378(a).) "The term 'project' refers to the activity which is
22 |being approved and which may be subject to several discretionary approvals by governmental agencies.
23 The term 'project' does not mean each separate governmental approval." (Guidelines § 15378(c).)
24 Accordingly, agencies "must consider the whole of an action, not simply its constituent parts, when
25 determining whether [the action] will have a significant environmental effect (Citizens Assoc. for
26 Sensible Development of Bishop Area V. County of Inyo (1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 151)." (Guidelines §
27 15003(h).)

28 96. CEQA thus intends to ensure "that environmental considerations do not become

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR 'DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES 29 -

1 submerged by chopping a large project into many little ones - each with a minimal potential impact on
the environment - which cumulatively may have disastrous consequences." (Bozung V. Local Agency
3 Formation Com. (1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 283-284.)

4 97. The PEIR recognizes that the WaterFix is at least an "Example Project[] for Conveyance"
5 that might conceivably be implemented. (PEIR at 4-14 to 4-15 (emphasis added).) But since DWR had
6 already approved the WaterFix more than three months before the Draft PEIR was released on November
7 1, 2017, the Council should have addressed its impacts specifically and in detail SO as to alert the public
8 to the foreseeable impacts of the DPA. CEQA requires that each agency "must use its best efforts to find
9 out and disclose all that it reasonably can." (Guidelines § 15144.) And, it must disclose the "reasonably
10 foreseeable probable future projects." (Guidelines §§ 15355(b).)

11 98. The PEIR should have analyzed the particular conveyance facilities selected as part of the
12 WaterFix approval because they are foreseeable and will substantially affect the impacts that arise from
13 implementation of the DPA. The public has a right to know, for example, what environmental restoration
14 (measures would be needed if the WaterFix tunnels were to be built, the extent to which global warming
15 and sea level rise could affect water deliveries through the tunnels in comparison to other conveyance
16 methods, which conveyance methods best achieve the Delta Reform Act's goals, and how the chosen
17 conveyance method will affect implementation of the Delta Plan. The PEIR answers none of these
18 questions.

19 99. By only tangentially mentioning the WaterFix as a generalized "example" of type of
20 project that might occur rather than analyzing it in detail, the Council violated CEQA.

21 The Council's Responses to Comments Are Inadequate

22 100. CEQA requires that the Council provide detailed responses to comments that raise
23 significant environmental issues. (Guidelines § 15088.) The Council's responses must show a "good
24 faith, reasoned analysis," and must be supported by factual information. (Id.; Laurel Heights
25 Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of California (1993) 6 Cal.4th 1112, 1124.)

26 101. If a comment raises significant environmental issues and the agency chooses not to accept
27 its suggestions, the agency must explain why. (Guidelines § 15088(c); Flanders Foundation v. City of
28 Carmel-by-the-Sea (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 603, 615.) Meaningful agency response to public comment is

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
"DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES 30 -

1 fundamental to CEQA's informational purpose. For this reason, a failure to adequately respond to
2 comments renders an EIR "fatally defective." (People v. County of Kern (1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 830,
3 842.)

4 102. The Council failed to respond to numerous comments by improperly dismissing them as
5 "a comment addressing the merits of the Proposed Project and the implementation of the Delta Plan,

6 rather than the adequacy and content of the Draft PEIR." (PEIR at 3-339.) For example, petitioners
7 commented that the Draft PEIR's "objectives unreasonably narrow the focus of the PEIR" and that
8 "[u]nder CEQA, [the Council] must also consider a reasonable range of alternatives that are capable of
9 meeting the goals of the Delta Reform Act while lessening the impacts of the WaterFix." (Final PEIR at
10 Letter OR 4-3.) The Council declined to address this CEQA issue. (Id.) Instead the Council simply
11 deemed all comments that even indirectly related to the Delta Plan Amendments themselves (as opposed
12 to only the DEIR in isolation) to warrant no response, in violation of CEQA's informational purpose.

13 103. The Council's failure to provide a "good faith, reasoned analysis in response" to public
14 comment violated CEQA. (Guidelines § 15088(c).) §

15 The Council's Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations

16 Are Not Supported by Substantial Evidence

17 104. If a project will have "significant environmental effects," CEQA requires the agency to
18 make "one or more written findings for each of those significant effects, accompanied by a brief
19 explanation of the rationale for each finding." (Guidelines § 15091(a).) There are three "possible
20 findings":

21 (1) Changes or alterations have been required in, or incorporated into, the project which avoid

22 or substantially lessen the significant environmental effect ...

23 (2) Such changes or alterations are within the responsibility and jurisdiction of another public agency and .. have been adopted ... or can and should be adopted by such other agency.

24 (3) Specific economic, legal, social, technological, or other considerations . . . make infeasible

25 the mitigation measures or project alternatives identified in the final EIR.

26 |(Guidelines §15091(a); PRC § 21081(a).) The findings "shall be supported by substantial evidence in the
27 record." (Guidelines 15091(b).) Where, as here, an agency approves a project that has significant
28 environmental effects that "are not avoided or substantially lessened," the agency must "state in writing

VERIFIED PETITION POR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR "DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES - 31 -

1 the specific reasons to support its action." (Guidelines §§ 15093(b); 15096(h), 15064(a)(2).) This
2 "statement of overriding considerations shall be supported by substantial evidence," Guidelines section
3 15093(b), and is to be made in addition to the findings required under section 15091. (Guidelines §
4 15091(f).)

5 105. Requiring such findings and, when necessary, a statement of overriding considerations,
6 ensures that the agency carefully considers the proposed action's environmental effects and makes its
7 decisionmaking process transparent. The "intended effect is to facilitate orderly analysis and minimize
8 the likelihood that the agency will randomly leap from evidence to conclusions." (Topanga Assn. for a
9 Scenic Com. v. County of Los Angeles (1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 516-517.) Since they lay out the agency's
10 rationale, findings also help courts to police agency compliance with CEQA's required procedures. (Mira
11 Mar Mobile Com. v. City of Oceanside (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 477, 496 (noting that "findings must
12 bridge the analytic gap between the raw evidence and ultimate decision,' so as to allow a reviewing court
13 'to trace and examine the agency's mode of analysis") (citation omitted).)

14 106. In order to make the findings required under CEQA, the PEIR must properly identify and
15 fully analyze the Delta Plan's myriad significant environmental impacts. As discussed above, the PEIR
16 completely fails to do so. The Council's CEQA findings, which are based on this impacts analysis, are
17 therefore necessarily defective.

18 107. Likewise, the PEIR fails to consider alternatives such as substantially reduced Delta
19 exports that would feasibly attain most of the Project's objectives of "sustainable management" to restore
20 and protect the Delta's ecologic health while providing a "more reliable water supply for the state" to
21 meet consumptive needs. Where, as here, an agency has failed to determine whether there are feasible
22 lalternatives that would avoid a project's significant environmental impacts (or reduce them to
23 insignificance), its contrary findings are "necessarily invalid." (Uphold Our Heritage v. Town of
24 Woodside (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 587, 603; City of Marina v. Board of Trustees of California State
25 University (2006) 39 Cal.4th 341, 368.)

26 108. Moreover, the Council's findings and statement of overriding consideration lack
27 substantial evidentiary support. This omission violates CEQA. (PRC §§ 21081.5; Guidelines §8
28 15091(b), 15093(b).)

2 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

3 (Violation of the 2009 Delta Reform Act)

4 109. (Alleged by All Petitioners Against All Respondents)

5 The paragraphs set forth above are realleged and incorporated herein by reference.

6 Since the 2013 Delta Plan Was Invalid and Set Aside, the Council's Attempted Amendment of It Is Likewise Invalid.

7 110. The 2013 Delta Plan was set aside as "invalid" by the Sacramento Superior Court because
8 it violated the Delta Reform Act. (Judgment filed October 21, 2016 in North Coast Rivers Alliance v.
9 Delta Stewardship Council, JCCP No. 4758 at 2, 12.) The 2013 Delta Plan remains invalid. The
10 Superior Court has never altered its Judgment, and no appellate court has disturbed it. Nor has the
11 Council ever filed a Return to the Court "setting forth what it has done to comply with the [Court's
12 Peremptory] Writ [of Mandate]." (Id. at 3, 16.) Nor has the Superior Court ever "issue[d] an Order
13 discharging its Peremptory Writ of Mandate." (Id.) Because the 2013 Delta Plan remains invalid and set
14 aside, the Council's purported adoption of "Amendments" to that invalid 2013 Delta Plan is, perforce,
15 ultra vires. Surgery - even assuming adequate CEQA review - cannot resurrect a corpse. - Accordingly,
16 the DPA is likewise invalid and of no force and effect.

17

18 111. The DPA Is Invalid in any Event Because It Violates the Delta Reform Act.
The Delta Reform Act requires the Council to achieve the coequal goals of (1)
19 sustainable management of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta ecosystem;" (2) "a more reliable water
20 supply for the state;" (3) "protect[ing] and enhanc[ing] the quality of water supply from the Delta;" and
21 (4) "establish[ing] a governance structure that will direct efforts across state agencies to develop a legally
22 lenforceable Delta Plan." (Water Code § 85001.) The Delta Reform Act's goals highlight the need to
23 jachieve "sustainable management" of the Delta's ecosystem to "protect and enhance the quality of water
24 supply from the Delta." But rather than furthering these goals mandated by the Legislature, the Delta
25 Plan Amendments create obstacles to protecting and enhancing water quality and achieving sustainable
26 lmanagement in order to increase the export of water for consumption.

27 112. The first of the Delta Reform Act's three principal management tasks is to specifically
28 identify and correct the mismanagement practices that caused the Delta's ecological collapse. The Act

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES 33 -

1 declares that "existing Delta policies are not sustainable" and that "[r]esolving the crisis requires
2 fundamental reorganization of the state's management of Delta watershed resources." (Water Code §
3 85001(a).) To this end, the Act requires in Water Code section 85086 that the State Water Board develop

4 "an effective system of Delta watershed diversion data collection and public reporting," and "determine
5 instream flow needs of the Delta for the purpose of facilitating the [Council's] planning decisions that are
6 required to achieve the objectives of the Delta Plan." (Id. at (a), (b).) The State Water Board is

7 (specifically directed, "pursuant to its public trust obligations, [to] develop new flow criteria for the Delta
8 ecosystem necessary to protect public trust resources." (Water Code section 85086(c)(1).) The Board is
9 forbidden from approving any "change in the point of diversion of the [SWP] or [CVP] from the southern
10 Delta to a point on the Sacramento River" unless it "shall include appropriate Delta flow criteria and shall
11 be informed by the analysis conducted" in developing the public trust flow criteria. (Water Code §
12 85086(c)(2).) The WaterFix requires a "change in the point of diversion" of the SWP and CVP from the
13| South Delta to the Sacramento River and thus may not be approved unless it is "informed by the analysis"
14 set forth in the State Water Board's public trust flow criteria.

15 113. Notwithstanding this clear statutory mandate, and contrary to the Council's duty to restore
16 the Delta's "natural flows" as necessary to restore and protect the Delta's public trust resources, the
17 Council purported to adopt the DPA without awaiting the State Water Board's completion of its analysis
18 regarding the public trust flow criteria required by Water Code section 85086(c). Indeed, the DPA, like
19 the Delta Plan before it, entirely fails even to acknowledge past mismanagement of public trust resources,
20 let alone identify and rectify its causes. The DPA's failure to address the causal relationship between
21 lexcessive diversions and ecologic disaster skews the DPA away from both the causes of the Delta's most
22 fundamental problems and their solutions. The DPA has thus betrayed the Legislature's clear command
23 that the Council acknowledge and correct decades of Delta mismanagement.

24 114. As an additional safeguard to prevent approval of massive diversions from the Delta
25 similar to those that have wreaked such ecological havoc in the past, the Legislature adopted detailed
26 |criteria for approval of the WaterFix's predecessor, the so-called Bay Delta Conservation Plan ("BDCP").
27 In Water Code section 85320(b), the Legislature directed that "[t]he BDCP shall not be incorporated into
28 the Delta Plan and the public benefits associated with the BDCP shall not be eligible for state funding,

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES 34 -

1 unless the BDCP does all of the following: (1) Complies with [the Natural Community Conservation
2 Planning Act] commencing with section 28000 .. . of the Fish and Game Code . . . ." Because of
3 objections from state and federal fisheries agencies, the WaterFix does not qualify as a "Natural a
4 Community Conservation Plan." (Final PEIR at 3-5.) Consequently, the WaterFix may not be
•5 "incorporated into the Delta Plan" and is not "eligible for state funding." (Water Code § 85320(b).) Yet
6 contrary to these clear statutory prohibitions, the Council has reverse-engineered the DPA to, in effect,
7 allow the WaterFix to proceed absent compliance with the Legislature's mandate that it conform to the
8 criteria for adoption of a Natural Community Conservation Plan. Together with the Council's failure to
9 await completion of the State Water Board's adoption of public trust flow criteria as mandated by Water
10 Code section 85086(c), the Council has directly contravened the Legislature's prescribed procedures for
11 restoring and protecting the Delta's public trust resources.

12 115. The DPA is required by the Delta Reform Act to further the coequal goals of ecosystem
13 restoration and water supply reliability. But the DPA treats the ecosystem restoration goal not as coequal,
14 |but as secondary to and of lesser importance than the goal of ensuring water supply reliability -
15 particularly for large agricultural contractors south of the Delta. By paving the way for the WaterFix
16 despite its planned massive and ecologically harmful diversions, the Council abdicated its responsibility
17 to restore and protect the Delta ecosystem.

18 116. "The policy of the State of California is to reduce reliance on the Delta in meeting
19 California's future water supply needs through a statewide strategy of investing in improved regional
20 supplies, conservation, and water use efficiency." § (Water Code § 85021 (emphasis added).) This
21 objective is the second of three principal features of the Delta Reform Act. (Water Code §§ 85020,
22 85021, 85023.) But because the DPA does not substantially reduce export levels as shown above, it
23 violates the Legislature's clear mandate to reduce reliance on the Delta's water supplies and increase
24 reliance on surface and ground water supplies elsewhere.

25 117. The DPA also fails to adopt and implement the eight specific policy objectives mandated
26 by the Legislature in Water Resources Code section 85020, the third principal feature of the Delta Reform
27 Act. Those objectives require a host of actions intended to restore the Delta, including recovery of "its
28 fisheries and wildlife, as the heart of a healthy estuary and wetland ecosystem," protection of the "unique

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR 'DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVB RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES • 35 -

1 cultural, recreational, and agricultural values of the California Delta," and improved "statewide water
2 conservation, water use efficiency, and sustainable water use" as necessary to "reduce reliance on the
3 Delta in meeting California's future water supply needs." (Water Code §§ 85020(b), (c), (d), 85021.)
4 The DPA fails to include specific implementation measures that will promote recovery of a healthy Delta
5  ecosystem while providing a reliable water supply, improved water conservation, and better water use

6 lefficiency, as required by Water Code sections 85302 and 85303. The DPA also fails to utilize the "best
7 lavailable scientific information," include "quantified or otherwise measurable targets" to achieve its
8 objectives, and provide for continuing monitoring and data collection to assure that its management
9 measures do in fact achieve ecosystem restoration, as required by Water Code sections 85211 and 85308.
10 Rather than developing specific management steps and enforceable standards to achieve the Legislature's
11 jenumerated goals, the DPA presents only generalized discussions of these topics that ignore the
12 devastating impacts that the WaterFix's diversion of water underneath the Delta will cause. The Council
13 has thus sidestepped its primary responsibility to translate the Legislature's clear policy objectives into
14 specific and enforceable management measures and performance standards.

15 118. By failing to meet any of the principal requirements of the Delta Reform Act in its
16 development and approval of the DPA, the Council has violated the Delta Reform Act.

17 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

18 (Violation of the Public Trust Doctrine)

19 (Alleged by All Petitioners Against All Respondents)
20 119. The paragraphs set forth above are realleged and incorporated herein by reference.
21 120. Water Code section 85023 states, "the longstanding constitutional principle of reasonable
22 luse and the Public Trust Doctrine shall be the foundation of state water management policy and are
23 particularly important and applicable to the Delta." The PEIR recognizes that compliance with the Public
24| Trust Doctrine is required by the Delta Reform Act. (PEIR at 5.11-157, citing Water Code § 85023.)
25 121. In National Audubon Society v. Superior Court (1983) 33 Cal.3d 419, 426, the court noted
26 that the public trust doctrine mandates that "before state courts and agencies approve water diversions
27 |they consider the effect of such diversions upon interests protected by the public trust, and attempt, so
28 far as feasible, to avoid or minimize any harm to those interests." The National Audubon Society Court

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES 36 -

1 went on to explain:

2 Just as the history of this state shows that appropriation may be necessary for efficient use of

3 water despite unavoidable harm to public trust values, it demonstrates that an appropriative water rights system administered without consideration of the public trust may cause unnecessary and unjustified harm to trust interests. As a matter of practical necessity the state
4 may have to approve appropriations despite foresecable harm to public trust uses. In so doing,

5 however, the state must bear in mind its duty as trustee to consider the effect of the taking on the public trust, and to preserve, so far as consistent with the public interest, the uses protected by the trust.
6

7 (Id., citations omitted.)

8 122. "Public trust easements are traditionally defined in terms of navigation, commerce and
9 fisheries. They have been held to include the right to fish, hunt, bathe, swim, to use for boating and
10 |general recreation purposes the navigable waters of the state, and to use the bottom of the navigable
11  waters for anchoring, standing, or other purposes." (Marks v. Whitney (1971) 6 Cal.3d 251, 259.)
12 For nearly 50 years it has been settled law in California that public trust values also "encompass[] .. . the
13 preservation of those lands in their natural state, so that they may serve as ecological units for scientific
14 study, as open space, and as environments which provide food and habitat for birds and marine life, and
15 which favorably affect the scenery and climate of the area." (Id.)
16 123. Implementation of the DPA will adversely affect numerous public trust resources. As the
17 PEIR and the Council's CEQA findings explain, the chosen alternative will harm wetlands, riparian
18 vegetation, special-status species, and recreational activities, among other public trust resources.

19 124. With regard to impacts on public trust resources, the Council failed to consider and adopt
20 an alternative that would substantially reduce diversions sufficiently to restore the Delta's public trust
21 resources including its fish and wildlife.

22 125. By ignoring and rejecting alternatives that would substantially reduce exports from the
23 Delta and thus restore public trust resources to a far greater extent than is even claimed for the approved
24 DPA, the Council abdicated its statutory and constitutional obligation to preserve public trust resources to
25 the maximum extent feasible, based on a fair and fully informed balancing of the impacts of these
26 alternatives on public trust resources.

2 (Writ of Mandate, Declaratory and Injunctive Relief to Set Aside

3 Project Approvals as Contrary to C.C.P. §§ 1085 and 1094.5)

4 (Alleged by All Petitioners Against All Respondents)

5 126. The paragraphs set forth above are realleged and incorporated herein by reference.

6 127. The Council proceeded in excess of its jurisdiction and abused its discretion in purporting
7 to approve the DPA and certify its PEIR because such approvals violate CCP sections 1085 and 1094.5 in
8 the following respects, among others:

9 a. such approvals were not granted in accordance with the procedures required by
10 law;

11 b. such approvals were not based on the findings required by law; and

12 C. such approvals were not based on, or were contrary to, the evidence in the record
13 before the Council.

14 128. The Council failed to proceed in the manner required by law in the following respects,
15 among others:

16 a. the Council violated CEQA as alleged hereinabove;

17 . b. the Council violated the Delta Reform Act; and

18 C. the Council violated the Public Trust Doctrine.

•19 129. The Council's actions in approving the Delta Plan without complying with the procedures
20 required by CCP sections 1085 and 1094.5 exceeded the Council's jurisdiction and constitute a
21 prejudicial abuse of discretion, and therefore are invalid and must be set aside.

22 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

23 WHEREFORE, petitioners pray for relief as follows:

24 1. For interlocutory and permanent injunctive relief restraining the Council from taking any
25 action to carry out the Delta Plan Amendments pending, and following, the hearing of this matter;

26 2. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing the Council to set aside and vacate its approval
27 of the Delta Plan Amendments and certification of their PEIR;

28 3. For declaratory relief declaring the Delta Plan Amendments and their PEIR to be unlawful;

22 Petitioners North Coast Rivers Alliance, et al., hereby petition the Court for a writ of mandate
23 against respondent Delta Stewardship Council and by this verified petition allege as follows:

24 INTRODUCTION

25 1. This is a public interest citizen suit to enforce California's environmental laws and protect
26 the Delta from imminent ecologic collapse. Petitioners bring this action to challenge the Delta
27 Stewardship Council's ("Council's") approval of its Delta Plan Amendments ("Delta Plan Amendments"
28 or "DPA") and certification of its Program Environmental Impact Report ("PEIR") on April 26, 2018. In

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES 1-

1  taking these actions, the Council violated the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public
2 Resources Code section 21000 et seq., the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Reform Act of 2009 ("Delta
3 Reform Act"), Water Code section 85000 et seq., and the Public Trust Doctrine.

4 2. CEQA requires the Council to fully examine the impacts of continuing the existing,
5 excessive level of water exports from the Delta, and to carefully consider alternatives that would avoid

6 and reduce those impacts. Contrary to CEQA, the Council's PEIR does neither. Although it purports to
7 analyze the environmental impacts of the DPA as required by CEQA, its real - but undisclosed - agenda
8 is to bless the Department of Water Resources ("DWR's") approval on July 21, 2017 of the so-called
"California WaterFix" ("WaterFix"), which will harm rather than restore the Delta's ecological health by
10 diverting most of the Sacramento River's summer flow before it even reaches the Delta. To that end, the
11 PEIR understates the impacts of the WaterFix and fails to adequately consider feasible alternatives and
12 mitigation measures that would prevent the Delta's further ecologic collapse. Because the PEIR falls far
13 Ishort of achieving CEQA's twin mandates of identifying and avoiding significant environmental harm, it
14 violates CEQA.

15 3. The Delta Reform Act requires the Council to complete a Delta Plan to achieve the "co-
16 equal goals" of "providing a more reliable water supply for California and protecting, restoring, and
17 enhancing the Delta ecosystem." (Water Code §§ 85054, 85300.) The DPA does not achieve these goals.
18 Instead, it accommodates the WaterFix and its unsustainable levels of Delta exports that will thwart
19 |protection and restoration of the Delta ecosystem. Because the DPA will harm rather than restore the
20 Delta's imperiled fish and wildlife, it violates the Delta Reform Act.

21 4. The Public Trust Doctrine protects the Delta's imperiled fish and wildlife from avoidable
22 harm whenever it is feasible to do so. Contrary to this mandate, the DPA accommodates the WaterFix
23 and its unsustainable level of Delta exports that will needlessly harm public trust resources, and dismisses
24 from consideration feasible alternatives and mitigation measures that would protect and restore the
25 Delta's ecological functions. Because the DPA harms rather than protects the Delta's fish and wildlife, it
26 violates the Public Trust Doctrine.

27 VENUE AND JURISDICTION

28 5. This Court has jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR "DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES - 2 --

1 ("CCP") sections 526 (injunctive relief), 1060 (declaratory relief), 1085 (traditional mandamus), and
2 1094.5 (administrative mandamus); Public Resources Code ("PRC") sections 21168 and 21168.5
3 (mandamus review); and article VI, section 10 of the California Constitution.
4 6. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to CCP sections 393 (actions against public
5 officers) and 395 (actions generally) because the Council's offices are located in Sacramento.

6 7. Pursuant to CCP section 388, petitioners are serving the California Attorney General with

7 copy of this verified petition and complaint. Consistent with PRC section 21167.5, petitioners timely
8 served the Council with notice of this suit.

9 PARTIES

10 8. Petitioner NORTH COAST RIVERS ALLIANCE ("North Coast Rivers") is a non-profit
11 unincorporated association with members throughout Northern California. North Coast Rivers was
12 formed for the purpose of protecting California's rivers and their watersheds from the adverse effects of
13 excessive water diversions, ill-planned urban development, harmful resource extraction, pollution, and
14 other forms of environmental degradation. Its members use and enjoy California's rivers and watersheds
15 for recreational, aesthetic, scientific study, and related non-consumptive uses. The interests of North
16 Coast Rivers and its members have been, are being, and unless the relief requested herein is granted, will
17 be adversely affected and injured by the Council's approval of the DPA and certification of its inadequate
18 PEIR.

19 9. Petitioner INSTITUTE FOR FISHERIES RESOURCES ("IFR") is a non-profit, tax-
20 exempt organization that works to protect and restore salmon and other fish populations and the human
21 economies that depend on them. IFR maintains its principal place of business in San Francisco,
22 California. IFR both funds and manages many fish habitat protection programs and initiatives. In that
23 capacity, IFR advocates for measures to protect fish health and habitat and has successfully advocated for
24 dam removals, improved pesticide controls, better forestry stream protection standards, and enhanced
25 marine and watershed conservation regulations throughout the West Coast. IFR has worked tirelessly for
26 years to restore and enhance the Delta and its beleaguered fish and wildlife. IFR and its members will be
27 directly and indirectly injured by the DPA's failure to adequately protect and restore the imperiled
28 fisheries of the Delta.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR "DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES - 3 -

1 10. Petitioner PACIFIC COAST FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATIONS
2 ("Pacific Coast Fishermen") is a nonprofit membership organization incorporated in 1976 with
headquarters located in San Francisco, California. Pacific Coast Fishermen is composed of more than 20
4 Iseparate commercial fishing and vessel owners' associations along the West Coast. By virtue of its
5 combined membership, Pacific Coast Fishermen is the single largest commercial fishing organization on
6 the West Coast. Pacific Coast Fishermen represents the majority of California's organized commercial
7 salmon fishermen and has been an active advocate for the protection of Pacific salmon for more than 20
8 years. Pacific Coast Fishermen and its members will be harmed by the DPA because it would undermine
9 sustainable management of the salmonid fisheries resources of the Delta and its connected ecosystems on
10 which these members rely for their commercial fishing livelihoods.

11 11. Petitioner SAN FRANCISCO CRAB BOAT OWNERS ASSOCIATION ("San Francisco
12 Fishermen") is a century-old association of owners and operators of small, family owned fishing boats
13 that catch Dungeness crab, wild California King salmon, Pacific herring, and other species that live in and
14 depend upon the cold waters of the Pacific Ocean. San Francisco Fishermen is also actively involved in
15 community education and advocacy concerning fisheries resources legislation to ensure that the rich
16 heritage of commercial fishing in the Bay Area will survive for future generations. San Francisco
17 Fishermen and its members will be harmed by the DPA because it would threaten their continued historic

18 luse and enjoyment of the fisheries resources of the Delta and its connected ecosystems.

19 12. Petitioner WINNEMEM WINTU TRIBE is a Native American Tribe whose aboriginal
20 territory encompasses the upper watersheds of the Sacramento River including the McCloud River. The
21 Winnemem Wintu Tribe was traditionally dependent on salmon fishing for both subsistence and cultural
22 purposes, and maintains a deep cultural, spiritual and recreational interest in the continued viability of
23 California's salmon runs that pass through the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta ('Delta"). The
24 Winnemem Wintu Tribe is a strong proponent of Delta restoration, and will be harmed by the reduced
25 Delta fresh water flows, degradation of water quality, destruction of fish and wildlife species, and other
26 Ienvironmental harms that implementation of the DPA will allow.

27 13. Respondent DELTA STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL ("Council") is a California public
28 agency established by the Delta Reform Act and required by that Act to protect and restore the fish and

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
'DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIER AND ATTORNEYS' FEES - 4 -

1 wildlife of the Delta. Its approval of the DPA is subject to and violated the requirements of the Delta
2 Reform Act, CEQA, and the Public Trust Doctrine. The Council is the lead agency under CBQA for
3 environmental review of the DPA.

4 14. The true names and capacities of respondents DOES I-XX, inclusive, are unknown to
5 Ipetitioners who therefore sue such respondents by fictitious names pursuant to CCP section 474.

6 Petitioners are informed and believe, and based on such information and belief allege, that the fictitiously
7 named respondents are public officials or agencies who are responsible, in whole or in part, for the
8 approval and implementation of the DPA. Petitioners will, with leave of Court if necessary, amend this
9 /Verified Petition if and when the true names and capacities of said DOE respondents have been

10 ascertained.

11 15. The Council did not identify any real parties in interest in its Notice of Determination for
12 the DPA pursuant to PRC section 21167.6.5(a), and petitioners are not otherwise aware that any real
13 |parties in interest exist. The true names and capacities of real parties in interest DOES XXI-L, inclusive,
14 are unknown to petitioners who therefore sue such real parties in interest by fictitious names pursuant to
15 CCP section 474. Petitioners are informed and believe, and based on such information and belief allege,
16 that the fictitiously named real parties in interest have a direct interest in approval of the DPA.
17 Petitioners will, with leave of Court if necessary, amend this Verified Petition if and when the true names
18 and capacities of said DOE real parties in interest have been ascertained.

19 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

20 16. Petitioners have authorized their attorneys to file this lawsuit on their behalf to vindicate
21 their substantial beneficial interest in securing the Council's compliance with the law.

22 17. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to the filing of this Verified
23 Petition and Complaint and have exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent

24 required by law.

25 18. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law
26 within the meaning of CCP section 1086 in that, unless this Court issues its writ of mandate setting aside
27 the Council's approval of the DPA, and ordering it to comply with the laws whose violation is alleged
28 herein, the environmental interests of petitioners and the public that are protected by those laws will be

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES - 5 -

1 Isubstantially and irreparably harmed. No monetary damages or other legal remedy could adequately
2 compensate petitioners for the harm to their beneficial interests, and to the environment, occasioned by
3 the Council's unlawful conduct.

4 19. Petitioners are entitled to declaratory relief under CCP section 1060 because an actual
5 controversy exists between petitioners and the Council. Petitioners contend that the Council has acted in
6 Iviolation of applicable laws and must therefore vacate and set aside its approval of the DPA. Petitioners
7 are informed and believe that the Council disputes this contention. A judicial resolution of this
8 controversy is therefore necessary and appropriate.

9 20. Petitioners are also entitled to injunctive relief under CCP section 526 because approval of
10 the DPA threatens irreparable environmental harm. Unless enjoined, the Council will implement the
11 DPA despite its lack of compliance with applicable laws, causing undue and unnecessary environmental
12 degradation. Petitioners would thereby suffer irreparable harm due to the Council's failure to take the
13 required steps to adequately protect the environment. Injunctive relief is thus warranted under CCP
14 section 525 et seq. and PRC section 21168.9 to prevent irreparable harm to the environment.

15 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

16 21. "[T]he Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta is a natural resource of statewide, national,
17 land international significance, containing irreplaceable resources." (PRC § 29701.) The Delta is the
18 [largest and most productive estuarine system on the West Coast of North and South America, but its
19 |future is in peril. It is the State of California's avowed policy "to recognize, preserve, and protect those
20 resources of the delta for the use and enjoyment of current and future generations." (Id.)

21 22. The Delta's imminent ecologic collapse is well-recognized and indisputable. It has two
22 |principal causes. First, an unsustainable proportion of the Delta's freshwater flows has been diverted for
23 decades by the Central Valley Project ("CVP") and the State Water Project ("SWP"). Second, for too
24 long, agricultural diverters have discharged run-off contaminated with salt, selenium, and other toxic
25 substances back into the rivers and groundwaters that are tributary to the Delta. This one-two punch of
26 diminished freshwater flows and increased temperature, salinity and herbicides, pesticides, and heavy
27 metals has pushed the Delta to the brink of ecologic collapse.

28 23. Due to excessive diversions of water for consumptive use, many species of fish endemic to

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR 'DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES - 6 -

1 the Delta have already gone extinet, including the Sacramento perch, formerly one of the most abundant
2 fish of the Delta, which disappeared in the 1970s. Just 12 indigenous species remain, and these are in
3 grave danger. Since the SWP and CVP began operation, the Sacramento River winter and spring run
4 Chinook salmon, Central Valley steelhead, North American green sturgeon and Delta smelt have been
5 driven perilously close to extirpation. Each of these species is listed as either endangered or threatened
6 lunder the federal Endangered Species Act.

7 24. In addition to harming many fish species in the Delta, the excessive use of Delta water
8 exports to irrigate contaminated soils in the San Joaquin Valley pollutes ground and surface waters that
9 flow into the Delta. Irrigation leaches pollutants from the toxic soils underlying many of the areas
10 irrigated with Delta water. The subsurface drainage and surface run off from these contaminated soils
11 contain pollutants including selenium, arsenic, boron, mercury, uranium, chromium, molybdenum and
12 sodium sulfates. The resulting pollution of the Delta and its San Joaquin Valley tributaries threatens the
13 Delta's water quality and the fish and wildlife dependent on them.

14 25. To address the indisputably perilous state of the Delta, in 2009 the California Legislature
15 lenacted the Delta Reform Act, declaring that "[t]he Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta watershed and
16 |California's water infrastructure are in crisis and existing Delta policies are not sustainable." (Water
17 Code § 85001(a) (emphasis added).) The Legislature found that ""the Delta' is a critically important
18 natural resource for California and the nation. It serves Californians concurrently as both the hub of the
19 California water system and the most valuable estuary and wetland ecosystem on the west coast of North
20 and South America." (Water Code § 85002.) "Resolving the crisis requires fundamental reorganization
21 of the state's management of Delta watershed resources." (Water Code § 85001(a) (emphasis added).)
22 Therefore, the Legislature resolved "to provide for the sustainable management of the [Delta] ecosystem,
23 to provide for a more reliable water supply for the state, to protect and enhance the quality of water
24 supply from the Delta, and to establish a governance structure that will direct efforts across state agencies
25 to develop a legally enforceable Delta Plan." (Water Code § 85001(c) (emphasis added).)

26 26. The Delta Reform Act was meant to advance the "coequal goals" of restoring the Delta
27 ecosystem and ensuring water supply reliability. (Water Code § 85054.) The Legislature found § that eight
28 objectives" were inherent in those coequal goals:

|VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR 'DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES - 7 -

1 (a) Manage the Delta's water and environmental resources and the water resources of the

2 state over the long term.
(b) Protect and enhance the unique cultural, recreational, and agricultural values of the
3 California Delta as an evolving place.

4 (c) Restore the Delta ecosystem, including its fisheries and wildlife, as the heart of a healthy

5 estuary and wetland ecosystem.
(d) Promote statewide water conservation, water use efficiency, and sustainable water use.
6

7 (e) Improve water quality to protect human health and the environment consistent with achieving water quality objectives in the Delta.

8 (f) Improve the water conveyance system and expand statewide water storage.

9 (g) Reduce risks to people, property, and state interests in the Delta by effective emergency

10 preparedness, appropriate land uses, and investments in flood protection.
(h) Establish a new governance structure with the authority, responsibility, accountability,
11 scientific support, and adequate and secure funding to achieve these objectives.
12 302 (Water Code § 85020 (emphasis added).)

13 27. The Legislature also declared that:

14 The policy of the State of California is to reduce reliance on the Delta in meeting

15 California's future water supply needs through a statewide strategy of investing in improved regional supplies, conservation, and water use efficiency. Each region that

16 depends on water from the Delta watershed shall improve its regional self-reliance for water through investment in water use efficiency, water recycling, advanced water

17 technologies, local and regional water supply projects, and improved regional coordination of local and regional water supply efforts.
18 (Water Code § 85021 (emphasis added).)

19 28. Reasonable use and the Public Trust Doctrine are to be the "foundation of state water
20 management policy." (Water Code § 85023.)

21 29. To achieve these environmental protections, the Delta Reform Act tasked the Council with
22 developing the Delta Plan. After repeated revisions of the Draft Delta Plan in 2011, the Council released
23 the Fifth Staff Draft Delta Plan in August 2011, and the Draft Delta Plan Program EIR in November
24 2011. Petitioners submitted extensive comments on both. After the public comment period, the Council
25 issued a Recirculated Draft Delta Plan FEIR ("RDFEIR") in November 2012. The Council then certified
26 the Final Delta Plan PEIR ("FPEIR") and approved the Delta Plan at a public meeting on May 16, 2013,
27 and published its CEQA Notice of Determination the next day.

28 30. Petitioners filed a Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate seeking judicial review of the

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
'DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES 8 -

1 Delta Plan on June 14, 2013. After three years of litigation, petitioners prevailed. On May 18, 2016,
2 Sacramento County Superior Court Judge Michael P. Kenny issued a 73-page Ruling on Submitted
3 Matter overturning the Council's approval of the Delta Plan on the grounds it violated the Delta Reform
4 Act. Judge Kenny's Ruling found that the Delta Plan failed to "[i]nclude quantified or otherwise
5 measurable targets associated with achieving reduced Delta reliance, reduced environmental harm from
6 invasive species, restoring more natural flows, and increased water supply reliability, in accordance with
7 the Delta Reform Act." (Ruling on Submitted Matter filed May 18, 2016 in the matter In Re Delta
8 Stewardship Council Cases, JCCP No. 4758 (*Ruling"), at 26.) Petitioners forwarded a copy of Judge
9 /Kenny's Ruling to the Council along with a letter summarizing its major holdings on June 21, 2016.
10 Judge Kenny clarified and strengthened his Ruling by his Clarification Order filed June 24, 2016, stating
11 that "[t]o be clear, the Delta Plan is invalid and must be set aside until proper revisions are completed."
12 (Id. at 4.)

13 31. Pursuant to the Ruling and Clarification Order, on October 21, 2016, the Superior Court
14 entered Judgment directing issuance of

15 "[a] Peremptory Writ of Mandate .. . ordering Respondent [Delta Stewardship Councill to set aside the Delta Plan because it is invalid due to the deficiencies identified in the
16 Court's Ruling and Clarification Order and to remedy those deficiencies in the Delta Plan and any applicable regulations by revising the Delta Plan and any applicable regulations to 17 include quantified or otherwise measurable targets associated with:

18 a. b. achieving reduced Delta reliance; reduced environmental harm from invasive species;
19 Jd restoring more natural flows; and increased water supply reliability 20
in accordance with the Delta Reform Act."
21

22 (Judgment filed October 21, 2016 in North Coast Rivers Alliance v. Delta Stewardship Council, JCCP
23 No. 4758, at 3:1-10.)

24 32. Rather than comply with Judge Kenny's Judgment and Peremptory Writ of Mandate, the
25 Council filed a Notice of Appeal. However, the mere filing of an appeal by the Council does not
26 automatically stay the Superior Court's Judgment as might otherwise be the case in non-writ proceedings
27 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 916. Instead, the Superior Court retains jurisdiction to
28 enforce its Judgment "because the rules governing the application of stays .. . on appeal in a civil 'action'

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES . 9-

1 (Code Civ. Proc., § 22) do not apply in a 'special proceeding' (Code Civ. Proc. § 23)." (Veyna v. Orange
2 County Nursery, Inc. (2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 146, 155 (citing Agricultural Labor Relations Bd. V. Tex-

3 Cal Land Management, Inc. (1987) 43 Cal.3d 696, 707.)) Petitioners' writ proceeding was brought
pursuant to CCP section 1085 et seq. Therefore it is a "special proceeding" as defined in CCP sections
5 23 and 1067-1131.

6 33. Further, even if CCP section 916 otherwise applied, it would operate to stay only that
7 portion of the Judgment that constituted a "mandatory" injunction. A mandatory injunction is one that
8 compel[s] the performance of a substantive act or a change in the relative positions of the parties."
9 (People v. Mobile Magic Sales, Inc. (1979) 96 Cal.App.3d 1, 13.) "By contrast, the prohibitive [or
10 Iprohibitory] order seeks to restrain a party from a course of conduct or to halt a particular condition."
11 (Id.) And, "the character of prohibitory injunctive relief, however, is not changed to mandatory in nature : 12 /merely because it incidentally requires performance of an affirmative act." (Id., citing United Railroads
13 v. Superior Court (1916) 172 Cal.80, 88-89.)

14 34. Judge Kenny's Peremptory Writ of Mandate and Judgment are prohibitory, rather than
15 mandatory, in character because they require the Council to suspend or rescind its unlawful approval of
16 Ithe Delta Plan. By thus restraining the Council from implementing the Delta Plan, the Peremptory Writ
17 of Mandate and Judgment prohibit the Council's otherwise unlawful implementation of the unlawfully-
18 approved Delta Plan. Therefore, the character of the Peremptory Writ of Mandate and Judgment is
19 *prohibitory," rather than "mandatory." As noted, "[tjhe character of prohibitory injunctive relief. . . is
20 not changed to mandatory . merely because it incidentally requires performance of an affirmative act"
21 (such as the Council's rescission of its unlawful approval of the Delta Plan. (People v. Mobile Magic
22 Sales, Inc., supra, 96 Cal.App.3d at 13; United Railroads v. Superior Court, supra, 172 Cal. at 88-89
23 (emphasis added).)

24 35. Because the Council's mere filing of a Notice of Appeal did not stay Judge Kenny's
25 Judgment and Peremptory Writ of Mandate, the Council remains subject to the Superior Court's
26 Peremptory Writ of Mandate and Judgment and is under a continuing duty to rescind its unlawful Delta
27 (Plan. Instead of discharging its duty to rescind the Delta Plan, the Council has ignored Judge Kenny's
28 Judgment and Peremptory Writ of Mandate, as if they did not exist. The Council's Draft PEIR, for

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR "DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES - 10 -

1 example, never mentions either the Peremptory Writ of Mandate or the Judgment.

2 36. Despite requests by petitioners and others that the Council comply with the Peremptory
3 Writ of Mandate and Judgment, the Council has continued to act as though its Delta Plan had not been

4 ruled "invalid" and set aside by Judge Kenny. To the contrary, the Council confirmed its seeming
5 disregard of Judge Kenny's Judgment and Peremptory Writ of Mandate by purporting on April 26, 2018
6 to approve three Amendments to the Delta Plan and related regulations ("Delta Plan Amendments" or
7 DPA"), certify a Program Environmental Impact Report ("PEIR") thereon, adopt Findings purporting to
8 support approval of the DPA, and adopt a Statement of Overriding Considerations ("SOC") justifying
9 approval of the DPA notwithstanding its admittedly significant adverse environmental impacts. The
10 Council then filed a Notice of Determination for these approvals with the Governor's Office of Planning
11 and Research purportedly in compliance with Public Resources Code section 21083.

12 37. The Delta Plan PEIR states that the DPA will "promote options for water conveyance,
13 storage systems and the operation of both as required by Wat[er] Code section 65304." (PEIR at 3-17.)
14 However, only one "conveyance option" is "promoted" - the so-called California WaterFix previously
15 approved by the Department of Water Resources. The PEIR directs that "[t]he DWR [Department of
16 /Water Resources] and [the U.S. Bureau of] Reclamation, and local beneficiary agencies should pursue a
17 dual conveyance option for the Delta." (Id. at 3-18 (emphasis added).) The PEIR's reference to the "dual
18 conveyance" option is "code" for the"California WaterFix" ("WaterFix") that DWR had already
19 approved on July 21, 2017. It is a massive 30-mile long pair of "twin tunnels" each some 40 feet in
20 diameter, and three additional intake tunnels aggregating another 15 miles, for an overall length of 45
21 |miles, that would divert most of the Sacramento River's flow underneath the Delta for export. (BDCP/
22 WaterFix FEIR/S Chapter 3 at 3-89 through 3-93, 3-111 through 3-112, esp. Table 3-17 on p. 3-91.) At
23 partial capacity it would divert up to 9,000 cubic feet per second ("cfs") - about 6.5 million acre-feet per
24 year, sufficient to flood the entire state of Rhode Island under nearly 7 feet of water - from the
25 Sacramento River to Clifton Court Forebay for export south. Diverting this staggering quantity of water
26 would exacerbate the Delta's ecologic decline, rather than "restore the Delta ecosystem" as the
27 Legislature commanded. (Water Code 85020(c).). If utilized to its maximum hydraulic capacity, it could
28 divert up to 15,000 cfs, or more than 8.1 million acre feet per year.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES - 11 -

1 38. The DPA's accommodation of this gargantuan diversion scheme flies in the face of the
2. Legislature's declared intent through the Delta Reform Act "to reduce reliance on the Delta in meeting
3 California's future water supply needs" by improving "regional self-reliance." (Water Code § 85021
4 (emphasis added).) By promoting DWR's massive new conveyance infrastructure, the Delta Plan ensures
5 Ithat water users south of the Delta will not pursue regional self-reliance, and the Delta will continue to
6 deteriorate as excessive quantities of fresh water are unsustainably siphoned off.

7 39. The twin-tunnel WaterFix previously approved by DWR and promoted by the DPA would
8 be extraordinarily cost-inefficient - the only peer reviewed cost-benefit analysis of the WaterFix
9 estimated that it would cost $2.50 for every $1.00 in benefits. The bulk of the burden would fall upon
10 taxpayers, urban water ratepayers, and the natural environment, while large agribusiness would reap most
11 fof the benefits.

12 40. As noted above, despite the Superior Court's Ruling setting aside the 2013 Delta Plan
13 because it violated the Delta Reform Act, the Council has acted as if the Court had not vacated the 2013
14 Delta Plan and as though the plainly deficient 2013 PEIR were instead sufficient. These "business as
15 usual" assumptions animate the entire Draft PEIR. The Council's concerted effort to ignore the Court's
16 Ruling overturning the 2013 Delta Plan as unlawful, and the Council's apparent disregard of the profound
17 errors and omissions in that Plan's Program Environmental Impact Report (2013 PEIR"), must be
18 laddressed and corrected before the Council may lawfully proceed further with revisions to the Delta Plan.

19 41. Because the Sacramento Superior Court ruled that the 2013 Delta Plan violated the Delta
20 Reform Act, the Court did not reach petitioners' detailed challenges under CEQA to the sufficiency of the
21 2013 PEIR prepared to support the Delta Plan. The Court's Judgment, however, expressly "preserved"
22 these challenges. (Judgment in North Coast Rivers Alliance v. Delta Stewardship Council, JCCP No.
23 4758 filed October 21, 2016, at 3 18.) To the extent the Council now relies on the 2013 PEIR to
24 document its CEQA compliance for its invalid 2013 Delta Plan, petitioners reallege, reassert and
25 expressly incorporate their prior and expressly preserved challenges to that 2013 PEIR within this
26 Verified Petition.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Violation of CEQA for Inadequate Environmental Review)

3 (Alleged by All Petitioners Against All Respondents)

4 42. The paragraphs set forth above are realleged and incorporated herein by reference.

5 43. Petitioners bring this First Cause of Action pursuant to PRC sections 21168 and 21168.5,
6 on the grounds that the Council committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion, by failing to proceed in the
7 manner required by law, in approving a deeply flawed DPA based on a legally inadequate PEIR.

8 44. CEQA requires public agencies to conduct environmental review prior to approving any
9 project that may have a significant impact on the environment. (PRC §§ 21002.1, 21061, 21100, 21151;
10 | Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14 (CEQA Guidelines or "Guidelines") § 15004(a).) The Council is a "public
11 agency" within the meaning of CEQA. (PRC § 21063.) The Council's actions in approving and carrying
12 out the Delta Plan are subject to the requirements of CEQA.

13 45. The purpose of an EIR is to provide agencies and the public with information about a
14 proposed project's potential environmental effects, ways to minimize those effects, and potential
15 alternatives to the project. (PRC § 21061.) The EIR must "include a detailed statement" describing, inter
16 alia, all of the proposed project's significant effects on the environment, alternatives to the project, and
17 potential mitigation measures. (PRC § 21100(b).)

18 46. A program EIR may be prepared for a related "series of actions that can be characterized
19 as one large project." (Guidelines § 15168(a).) Program EIRs are useful because they allow the agency
20 to (1) provide "a more exhaustive consideration of effects and alternatives than would be practical in an
21 EIR on an individual action"; (2) ensure full consideration of cumulative impacts; (3) avoid "duplicative"
22 analysis of "basic policy considerations"; and (4) consider "broad policy alternatives and program wide
23 mitigation measures" when the agency still has the greatest "flexibility to deal with basic problems or
24 cumulative impacts." (PRC § 15168(b).) Program EIRs, however, must still meet all of the content
25 requirements of CEQA and its Guidelines. (Guidelines §§ 15160, 15120-15132.)

26 The PEIR Impermissibly Relies on the Council's Previous Unlawful Conduct.

27 47. Despite the Superior Court's Ruling setting aside the 2013 Delta Plan because it violates
28 the Delta Reform Act, and despite petitioners' meritorious challenges to the adequacy of the 2013 PEIR

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES 13 -

1 which were expressly "preserved" by the Superior Court's Judgment for future adjudication, the Council
2 repeatedly relies upon the 2013 PEIR as if it and the 2013 Delta Plan were lawful. For example, the Draft
PEIR adopts the 2013 PEIR's mitigation measures as sufficient for almost all impacts of the Delta Plan
4 Amendments. (ES-25 to ES-112 (Tables ES-3, ES-4, ES-25), 5.1-9 to 5.1-10 (agencies implementing
5 covered actions under Proposed Plan Amendments to implement 2013 PEIR mitigation measures), 5.1-
6 18, 5.1-19, 5.1-20, 5.1-28 to 5.1-31 (reliance on 2013 PEIR mitigation measures to reduce impacts of
7 Proposed Plan Amendments), 5.2-36 to 5.2-37 (same regarding aesthetic impacts), 5.2-42 to 5.2-43
8 (same), 5.3-27 to 5.3-45 (same regarding agricultural and forestry resources), 5.4-39 to 5.4-81 (same for
9 air quality and greenhouse gas emissions), 5.5-65 to 5.5-81 (same for aquatic biological resources), 5.6-
10 87 to 5.6-121 (same for terrestrial biological resources), 5.7-53 to 5.7-73 (same for cultural and
11 paleontological resources), 5.9-52 to 5.9-85 (same for geology, soils, seismicity and minerals resources),
12 5.10-38 to 5.10-65 (same for hazards and hazardous materials), 5.11-192 to 5.11-240 (same for hydrology
13 and water quality), 5.12-24 to 5.12-34 (same for land use and planning), 5.13-21 to 5.13-43 (same for
14 moise), 5.14-18 (same for population, employment and housing), 5.15-23 to 5.15-39 (same for recreation),
15 5.16-35 to 5.16-59 (same for transportation, traffic and circulation), 5.17-13 to 5.17-16 (same for tribal
16 cultural resources), 5.18-38 to 5.18-48 (same for utilities and public services), 7-8 to 7-43 (same for
17 cumulative impacts), Chapter 9 generally (applying same 2013 PEIR mitigation measures for no project
18 alternative, and Alternatives 1 to 3 to the Proposed Plan Amendments).)

19 48. The Draft PEIR relies upon the 2013 PEIR's mitigation measures even where the Delta
20 Plan Amendments would have potentially significant unmitigable impacts - a plain violation of CEQA.
21 (See, e.g., Tables ES-3 to ES-5.) Indeed, the Draft PEIR includes only one new mitigation measure,
22 Measure 5.2-1, which "is recommended for projects in the Primary and Extending Planning Areas" to
23 reduce glare impacts of transmission and distribution lines to less than significant. (Id. at 5.2-42.) This
24 measure, however, is a mere recommendation rather than a requirement, and thus violates CEQA's
25 mandate that "[m]itigation measures must be fully enforceable." (Guidelines § 15126.4(a)(2).)

26 49. In all other instances, instead of evaluating whether additional mitigation measures exist
27 that could minimize these potentially significant impacts, the Council merely states that "no new
28 mitigation measures are required because previously adopted 2013 PEIR Mitigation Measures . would

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR 'DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES - 14 -

1 apply to covered and non-covered actions in both the Primary and Extended Planning Areas." (E.g., id. at
2 5.2-31 (and 63 other instances in Chapter 5).) The Council's rote reliance on the 2013 PEIR sidesteps its
3 |duty to "use its best efforts" to ascertain whether feasible mitigation for the DPA's otherwise significant

4 (impacts may exist. (Guidelines §§ 15126.4, 15144.) It also subjects the Council to petitioners'
5 previously alleged and expressly preserved challenges to the adequacy of the Council's 2013 PEIR.

6 The Objectives Unreasonably Narrow the Focus of the PEIR

7 50. The Draft PEIR posits an objective of new or improved Delta conveyance infrastructure
8 that can, among other things, adapt to changing conditions, and increase the reliability of water available
9 for export supplies, arguing that this is required under the Delta Reform Act. (Id. at ES-5.) But the Delta
10 Reform Act requires instead that the Delta Plan "promote options for new and improved infrastructure
11 relating to the water conveyance in the Delta, storage systems, and for the operation of both to achieve the
12 coequal goals." (Water Code § 86304 (emphasis added).) By creating an objective that requires
13 increased reliability of water available for exports, the Council has set a goal that is counter to the Delta
14 Reform Act's co-equal goals of reducing Delta exports while increasing the reliability of water supplies.

15 51. The Council then doubles down on this improper objective by claiming that it justifies
16 dismissal from consideration of alternatives that would achieve the Delta Reform Act's co-equal goal of
17 restoring the Delta's natural flows and repairing its degraded ecosystem by reducing exports. (Water
18 Code §§ 85020(c), 85021; PEIR at ES-5 to ES-7, 9-1 to 9-29.)

19 52. The DPA and its PEIR fail to consider alternatives that would substantially reduce export
20 levels. The DPA calls for "statistically significant" decreases in annual exports only in critically dry
21 years, but at the same time, it calls for "statistically significant" increases in exports during wet years.
22 I(PEIR, Appendix C, Attachment C-5 at B-3.) The "fifteen-year average total exports during all year
23 types" are to "decrease by 5 percent or more from the average historical deliveries for the years 2000-
24 2014." (Id.) These goals are to be met by 2030. (Id.) The performance measures do not address what
25 occurs when these targets conflict. (Id.) By limiting reductions in exports to critically dry years, the
26 Council is not proposing sufficient change to reduce reliance upon the Delta as compared to existing
27 operations. To the contrary, when long-term water needs are developed based on water deliveries that are
28 possible only during the wettest of years, the entire system is over allocated. The only way for water

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR "DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES - 15 -

1 jexporters to consistently reduce reliance upon the Delta is for water exporters to consistently - rather than
2 merely occasionally - receive less water. Because the DPA performance measures set a target of
3 increased Delta exports except in critically dry years, they fail to comply with the coequal goals, and the
4 PEIR violates CEQA's mandate for consideration of a reasonable range of alternatives.

5 53. The PEIR's "Alternative 1" takes only a tiny step where a substantial reduction is required
6 to reverse the Delta's ecological nose dive. It would only require a 5 percent decrease in Delta exports in
7 below normal, dry, and critically dry years, a 10 percent decrease in monthly exports during the months of
8 July, August, and September (to be achieved by 2030) and a 10-year average total reduction by 2040 for
9 all water year types. (Id. at 9-24.) The performance measures included in Alternative 1 - albeit
10 insufficient to restore the Delta - would at least be more effective than the DPA in meeting the target of
11 reduced reliance upon the Delta. Yet perversely, the Draft PEIR determined that because of this modest
12 reduction in exports, Alternative 1 does not achieve the Project Objectives relating to reliability or
13 conveyance. (Id. at 9-29.) The illogic of this reasoning is palpable. It directly defies the Delta Reform
14 Act's overarching objective of reducing Delta exports in order to restore the Delta's natural flows and
15 thereby repair its degraded ecosystem, and violates CEQA's imperative that a reasonable range of

16 alternatives be considered. This violates CEQA's mandate that an EIR must analyze a "range of
17 reasonable alternatives that would feasibly attain most of the basic objectives of the project but would
18 lavoid or substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the project." (Guidelines § 15126.6(a).)

19 The Draft PEIR Improperly Favors the WaterFix at the Expense of Reasonable and

20 Feasible Alternatives That Can Meet the Coequal Goals

21 54. The Delta Reform Act invests the Council with responsibility to adopt a Delta Plan that
22 will reverse the ongoing collapse of the Delta ecosystem while making California's water supplies more
23 reliable. "Covered actions" will be evaluated for consistency with the Delta Plan. (Water Code §§
24 85057.5(a), 85225.) The WaterFix is "covered action" that must be evaluated for consistency with the
25 Delta Plan. (Id.) The Delta Plan must be written to meet the goals of the Delta Reform Act, rather than
26 reverse-engineered - as is the case with the DPA - to conform to the WaterFix and its unlawful goal of
27 maintaining excessive Delta exports.

28 55. The WaterFix will have the capacity to divert at least 3,000 cfs through each of three

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR "DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES - 16 -

1 separate intakes, for a total of 9,000 cfs. (WaterFix Final EIR/EIS V.II, Response to Comment
2 DEIR/DEIS 84, Comment 16.) This translates to an export rate of more than 6.5 million acre feet per
3 year.1 The south-of-Delta water districts that receive Delta exports expect that the WaterFix will deliver
4 4.9 million acre feet per year, and under Performance Measure 3.9, the target 2030 export amount is
5 (nearly the same, 4.845 million acre feet per year. (PEIR at 4-21, Appendix C, Attachment C-5 at E-4.)

6 56. The Council's apparent agenda to design its DPA in a manner that accommodates the
7 WaterFix is directly contrary to the Delta Reform Act. (PEIR at ES-5 to ES-7, 9-1 to 9-29.) That Act
8 mandates just the opposite -- that the Council adopt a Plan that reverses the Delta's ecologic decline by
9 forcing agencies to reduce their reliance on Delta exports. The Council should require exporters such as
10 DWR to conform to a Delta Plan that restores the Delta rather than, instead, adopt a Delta Plan (or a
11 DPA) that allows them to continue or even expand their excessive exports. The Council's contrary
12 approach with its DPA undermines rather than advances the purposes of the Delta Reform Act to
13 "reform" past harmful practices of excessive exports that have pushed the Delta's ecology to the brink of
14 collapse. This violates CEQA's requirement that "[t]he EIR shall discuss the inconsistencies between the
15 proposed project and applicable . . . regional plans." (Guidelines § 15125(d).)

16 57. The harm done to the CEQA process by ignoring the WaterFix's inconsistency with the
17 (Delta Plan's statutory mandate to reverse rather than exacerbate its ecologic collapse is profound. As
18 shown above, the Council dismissed from consideration alternatives that would substantially reduce the
19 (existing, completely unsustainable rate of export, and even rejected Alternative 1's very modest export
20 reductions. The "dual conveyance" option the Council adopted would maintain and exacerbate the
21 existing harmful rates of excessive export, and thereby create internal inconsistencies within the Delta

22 Plan.

23 58. Courts have rejected similar subterfuge in the analogous context of a county's or city's
24 evasion of its general plan standards by weakening them to allow an inconsistent project. Plan
25 lamendments that create inconsistencies with the rest of the plan are set aside. (See, e.g., Sierra Club v.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES • 17 -

1 Kern County Board of Supervisors (1981) 126 Cal.App.3d 698, 704.) The reason for this rule is
2 simple: it is impossible to find the amendments and the "covered actions" such as the WaterFix they are
3 lintended to allow consistent - as the Delta Reform Act requires - with an internally inconsistent plan. As
4 the Court in Sierra Club explained, if a general plan is rendered "internally inconsistent," then the project
5 lin question "could not be consistent with such plan . . . and [therefore] was invalid" when approved. (Id.,
6 126 Cal.App.3d at 704.) Like the Planning and Zoning Law at issue in Sierra Club, the Delta Reform Act
7 similarly requires plan consistency. Water Code §§ 85057.5(a), 85225.) Therefore the Council's
8 attempted approval of the Delta Plan Amendments that create inconsistencies with the rest of the Plan -
9 and the Delta Reform Act to boot - is unlawful.

10 59. The Council's gambit to allow the WaterFix "tail" to wage the Delta Plan "dog" does not
11 merely violate its CEQA duty to avoid projects that create undisclosed plan inconsistencies. It also
12 violates, as shown above, its CEQA duty to consider a reasonable range of alternatives that are capable of
13 meeting the goals of the Delta Reform Act while lessening the impacts of the WaterFix, including the
14 impacts of its construction and massive diversions. (Habitat and Watershed Caretakers v. City of Santa
15 Cruz (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 1277, 1301-1305; CEQA Guidelines § 15126.6(a).) Because the DPA
16 adopts specific goals that will be used to evaluate the WaterFix's consistency with the Delta Plan, the
17 Council's failure to ensure that those amendments are consistent with both of the coequal goals violates
18 both its CEQA duty to disclose inconsistencies with required plans and the Delta Reform Act itself.
19 |(Water Code § 85054.) The DPA and its PEIR fail to analyze, let alone demonstrate, this required
20 Iconsistency.

21 60. Contrary to the Council's statutory duty to evaluate the WaterFix for consistency with the
22 Delta Plan, the Council's PEIR and DPA instead treat the WaterFix as if it were the action that must be
23 accommodated by the subordinate Delta Plan. For this reason, the PEIR rejects Alternative 1 as not
24 "fully achiev[ing] any of the conveyance-related objectives" of the project. (Id. at 9-29.) Similarly, the
25 PEIR likewise rejects Alternatives 2 and 3 as only "partially achiev[ing] [or "contribut[ing] to"] many of
26 the CSO (Conveyance, Storage Systems and Operation of Both] Amendment objectives." (Id. at 9-35, 9-
27 41.) By configuring the DPA's objectives to accommodate the WaterFix, rather than the other way
28 around - and without explicitly acknowledging its improper inversion of the plan consistency

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR. 'DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES - 18 -

1 requirement - the Council has turned both the Delta Reform Act and CEQA on their respective heads.

2 The Project Description Is Inadequate

3 61. An EIR must contain a project description including "the project's technical, economic,
4 |and environmental characteristics." (Guidelines § 15124(c).) The "project" for CEQA purposes is "the
5 whole of an action" potentially causing direct or indirect "physical change in the environment." (Id. at §
6 15378(a).)

7 62. "[A]n accurate, stable and finite project description is the sine qua non of an informative
8 and legally sufficient EIR," while a "curtailed, enigmatic or unstable project description" is unacceptable.
9 (County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 197-199 ("County of Inyo");
10 Guidelines § 15124.) A clear and accurate picture of the project is required in order for agencies and the
11 public to "balance the proposed project's benefits against its environmental cost, consider appropriate
12 mitigation measures," and assess potential alternatives. (City of Santee v. County of San Diego (1989)
13 214 Cal.App.3d 1438, 1454.)

14 63. The PEIR states that the "project" here "consists of three proposed amendments to the
15 Delta Plan . ... [the] Delta Levee Investment and Risk Reduction Strategy Amendment[,] . . . . [the]
16 Conveyance, Storage Systems, and the Operation of Both Amendment[] .. [and the] Performance
17 Measures Amendment . ..." (PEIR ES 10-ES 11.) However, the whole of the "project" necessarily
18 includes all components of the legislatively mandated "fundamental reorganization of the state's
19 management of Delta watershed resources" that the Delta Plan is being proposed to achieve. (Water
20 Code § 85001(a).) Contrary to CEQA, the PEIR fails to address the entirety of the project that is being
21 approved. Indeed, the vague project description for the DPA is precisely the type of "enigmatic"
22 description that was condemned in County of Inyo. (County of Inyo, 71 Cal.App.3d at 199.)

23 64. Instead of actually describing each of the three Plan Amendments, the "Project
24 Description" in the PEIR provides only: cryptic, generic reference to each of them. The entire
25 "description" occupies just 18 lines of text. (PEIR at 3-1.) In order to ascertain what is actually
26 proposed, the reader must examine hundreds of pages scattered throughout several chapters and
27 appendices, thwarting informed public review and understanding of the DPA Project. For example,
28 Chapter 3.4 reveals that the DPA directs that DWR, Reclamation and other agencies "should pursue" a

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR 'DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES 19 -

1 "dual conveyance option for the Delta." (PEIR at 3-18.) However, no specific description of the "dual
2 conveyance option" that is in fact being promoted is provided in this Chapter. Instead, the reader is
3 jexposed to a series of broad, imprecise directives that tangentially suggest certain features of such a "dual
4  conveyance" option, without actually providing any concrete information. This exercise is needlessly
5 confusing, in view of the fact that the DPA's underlying purpose is simply to anoint the WaterFix already
6 approved by DWR in July, 2017.

7 65. Instead of providing a specific description of the WaterFix, the PEIR dissembles,
8 repeatedly denying that the "Proposed Project" has any specific parameters. Chapter 4.3.1 of the PEIR,
9 for example, tells the reader what the "Proposed Project" does not do, rather than what it would do. This
10 Chapter states that "[t]he Proposed Project does not direct the construction of specific projects, nor would
11 /projects be implemented under the direct authority of the Council." (PEIR at 4-7.) The reader is then
12 treated to a series of generalized descriptions of what kinds of "general types of activities" the Proposed
13 Project might entail, again without any specific parameters sufficient to afford the reader with enough
14 information to grasp what is specifically being proposed and approved. (PEIR at 4-7 to 4-16.) Even if
15 the enterprising reader digs into Appendix C-styled "Text of Proposed Delta Plan Amendments" - and
16 reviews, for example, Section 3 thereof regarding "Conveyance, Storage Systems and the Operation of
17 Both," the reader is subjected to the daunting task of working through hundreds of pages of various drafts
18 and edits of drafts of arcane subject matter regarding an admixture of nearly poignant platitudes and
19 incomprehensible terminology. (PEIR, Appendix C, Section 3, at 3-1 and pages following.)
20 Conspicuously absent is the straightforward and understandable description CEQA requires.

21 66. Contrary to CEQA's core mandate to inform the public of the DPA's impacts on the
22 environment, the actual policies and recommendations that comprise the DPA are buried and scattered
23 throughout hundreds of pages of disjointed and, in places, unintelligible text, charts, maps, proposed,
24 revised, interlineated and disorganized materials. (Id.) Worse, these hidden and cryptic policies are rife
25 with contradictions and conundrums. Policies are enforceable, but only with respect to "covered actions,"
26 while recommendations are not enforceable but "essential." (PEIR at 2-4.) To determine whether a given
27 project would be a "covered action," the reader must refer to other sections of the PEIR or to the Delta
28 Act itself. (Id. at 2-5 to 2-9.)

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR 'DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES • 20 -

1 67. Spreading a project description across multiple chapters and hiding the basic elements of
2 the proposed action in appendices is impermissible. (San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Center v. County of
3 Merced (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 645, 659 ("decision makers and [the] general public should not be forced
4 to sift through obscure minutiae or appendices in order to ferret out" fundamental aspects of the project's
5 description); Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. v. City of Rancho Cordova (2007) 40
6 Cal.4th 412, 442 ("*Vineyard") (*"[I]nformation "scattered here and there in EIR appendices," or a report
7 "buried in an appendix," is not a substitute for "a good faith reasoned analysis". . . .*).) The PEIR's
8 |fractured, cryptic and muddled project description frustrates CEQA's goal of making the agency's
9 decisionmaking accessible to the public. (Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of
10 California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392.)

11 The PEIR's Discussion of Purpose and Objectives Is Too Vague

12 68. CEQA requires that the project description provide a "statement of the objectives sought
13 by the proposed project," including "the underlying purpose of the project." (Guidelines § 15124(b).)
14 Clear objectives "help the lead agency develop a reasonable range of alternatives to evaluate" and "help
15 Ithe agency prepare its findings or statement of overriding considerations." (Id.)

16 69. The PEIR's statement of purpose and objectives is anything but clear. (PEIR at 3-1 to 3-
17 6.) Literally dozens of competing objectives are simply listed without any guide as to priorities, timing,
18 and sequencing. (Id.) Although some criteria for performance measures are provided, they are SO general
19 and unfocused as to be unusable. (Id.) Consequently, the reader is left without sufficient detail, let alone
20 la coherent narrative, with which to gain an understanding of what is being proposed. (Id.) This verbiage
21 evades informed understanding and therefore proves unhelpful in the evaluation of alternatives that are
22 intended to achieve the DPA's goals.

23 The PEIR's Discussion of the Plan's Impacts Is Incomplete

24 70. "The fundamental purpose of an EIR is 'to provide public agencies and the public in
25 [general with detailed information about"" a proposed project's environmental effects. (Vineyard, 40
26 Cal.4th at 428.) Therefore, CEQA requires that an EIR disclose and analyze all potential significant
27 environmental impacts of a proposed project. (PRC § 21100(b)(1); Guidelines § 15126.2.) The agency
28 must make a "good faith effort at full disclosure" of both short- and long-term direct, reasonably

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR 'DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES - 21 -

1 foreseeable indirect, and cumulative effects of the proposed project. (Guidelines §§ 15064(d), 15126.2,
2 15151.)

3 71. The PEIR's discussion of the Project's environmental impacts fails to do so. (PEIR at 5.1-

4 to 5.18-48.) It is far too vague, generalized and abstract to permit informed public review; it defers too
5 much analysis to later, project-specific environmental reviews; it fails to fully analyze the effects of the

6 WaterFix on each of the competing beneficial uses of water; it fails to fully discuss the presence and
7 impact of invasive species; and it ignores potential effects of the Project on all of its source watersheds -
8 including the Trinity River watershed - and the threatened salmon and other species that depend on them.

9 72. Throughout the PEIR's discussion of impacts, vagueness and abstraction preclude
10 effective analysis. (Id.) The PEIR speaks in such broad terms that it is impossible for the public to
11  discern and analyze the Project's environmental effects. For example, rather than "conduct detailed
12 modeling analysis of the Proposed Project," the PEIR instead attempted to "identify and review existing
13 environmental studies, data, model results, and other information for projects that are consistent with
14 those identified in Chapter 4 General Types of Activities, Potential Projects, and Construction Methods
15 That Could Result with Implementation of the Proposed Delta Plan Amendments." (PEIR at 5.4-28.)

16 73. The Council's excuse for not examining the actual, foreseeable impacts of the WaterFix
17 Iwas that "specific project details are unknown and identifying a set of assumptions that realistically
18 represents how the Proposed Project could be implemented (i.e., constructed and operated) is extremely
19 difficult . . . .)." (Id.) But in fact, the Council is fully conversant with the fact that the WaterFix is the
20 / "Proposed Project" - or, at least, the principal feature of the "Proposed Project". and, since it was
21 already approved in July, 2017 and was subject to its own CEQA analysis at that time, the Council could
22 have engaged in the required CEQA analysis based on the information provided for the WaterFix in its
23 own CEQA review. Indeed, the Council admits that this information was available in "[t]he Final
24 EIR/EIS for the BDCP/California WaterFix Project (DWR and Reclamation 2016a) [which] describes the
25 impacts associated with the California WaterFix . .. ." (Final PEIR at 3-9.) Instead of providing this
26 information in the PEIR, the Council embarked on a vague, confusing, and ultimately, misleading and
27 useless attempted examination of "existing environmental studies, data, model results, and other
28 information for projects that are consistent with those identified in [PEIR] Chapter 4." (Id.) As a

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR 'DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES • 22 -

1 consequence, the public was left with no clear understanding of the anticipated impacts of the DPA.

2 74. The very generality of the PEIR's purported "analysis" of the DPA's impacts precludes the
3 informed consideration of alternatives that CEQA requires. "The failure to provide enough information
4 to permit informed decision-making is fatal. 'When the informational requirements of CEQA are not
5 complied with, an agency has failed to proceed in a manner required by law and has therefore abused its
6 discretion." (Napa Citizens for Honest Government v. Napa County Board of Supervisors (2001) 91
7 Cal.App.4th 342, 361, quoting Save Our Peninsula Committee v. Monterey County Board of Supervisors
8 (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 99, 118, additional citations omitted.)

9 75. The PEIR impermissibly defers all specific analysis of the environmental impacts of
10 projects implementing the DPA even though those projects are foresecable and, indeed, an indispensable
11 Ipart of the DPA itself. Just because the PEIR purports to tier its environmental analysis "does not excuse
12 the lead agency from adequately analyzing reasonably foresecable significant environmental effects of the
13 project and does not justify deferring such analysis to a later tier EIR." (Guidelines § 15152(b).)
14 Therefore, lead agencies must not defer analysis of significant environmental effects if that analysis can,
15 as here, feasibly be undertaken for the implementing actions in question. (EPIC v. California Dept. Of
16 Forestry and Fire Protection (2008) 44 Cal.4th 459, 502-03; Guidelines § 15151 ("the sufficiency of an
17 EIR is to be reviewed in the light of what is reasonably feasible").)

18 The Council Failed to Fully Consider All Feasible Alternatives to the Plan and

19 the PEIR's Mitigations Measures Are Vague, Lack Quantifiable Criteria, and Are Unenforceable

20 76. CEQA requires an EIR to "include sufficient information about each alternative to allow
21 (meaningful evaluation, analysis, and comparison with the proposed project." (Guidelines § 15126.6(d).)
22 Agencies must prevent "significant, avoidable damage to the environment" through the use of feasible
23 alternatives or mitigation measures. (Guidelines § 15002(a)(3); PRC §§ 21002, 21002.1, 21081.) Project
24 approval should be withheld where such measures or alternatives exist, but are, as here, ignored.
25 |(Guidelines § 15021(a)(2).) An EIR's discussion of proposed mitigation measures must be sufficiently
26 specific to enable the public to evaluate and comment upon the adequacy of the alternatives and
27 mitigation measures. (Endangered Habitats League, Inc. v. County of Orange (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th
28 777, 794.)

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES • 23 -

1 77. The mitigation measures and alternatives in the PEIR and Monitoring and Reporting
2 Program are also inadequate because they contain only vague approximations of the significant impacts
3 that will result from implementation of the DPA, aré themselves vague and so malleable as to be illusory,
4 do not constitute mitigation or alternatives as defined under CEQA and its implementing Guidelines, and
5 improperly defer consideration without specific implementing standards. (PRC §§ 21100(b)(3) and (4);
6 Guidelines §§ 15126(e) and (f), 15126.4, 15126.6, 15370.) CEQA requires much more than the vague

7 and unenforceable recommendations that the PEIR proffers. (Guidelines §§ 15144, 15151; Kings County
8 Farm Bureau v. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 727-728.)
9 78. The PEIR considered four alternatives: No Project, Alternative 1 (Reduced Reliance on
10 the Delta Emphasis), Alternative 2 (Delta Wetland Restoration Emphasis), and Alternative 3 (Through-
11 Delta Conveyance Emphasis). Bach of these alternatives is flawed in significant respects, as summarized
12 below.

13 79. The No Project Alternative incorrectly posits retention of the existing, unlawful Delta
14 Plan. (PEIR at 9-17.) Since the 2013 Delta Plan was declared "invalid" and set aside by Judge Kenny in
15 2016, it is of no further force and effect and the Council may not attempt to resurrect this unlawful plan in
16 lthe guise of a "No Project Alternative." Instead, the PEIR should have complied with the CEQA
17 |Guidelines. They direct that "[t]he 'no project' analysis shall discuss the existing conditions at the time
18 the notice of preparation is published ... as well as what would be reasonably expected to occur in the
19 foresceable future if the project were not approved . . .." (Guidelines § 15126.6(e)(2).) The Council
20 published its Notice of Preparation on March 16, 2017 - 10 months after Judge Kenny had issued his
21 Ruling declaring the 2013 Delta Plan unlawful on May 18, 2016, 9 months after Judge Kenny had issued
22 his Clarification Order declaring the Plan "invalid" on June 24, 2016, and 5 months after 5 Judge Kenny
23 had entered Judgment on October 21, 2016 confirming those rulings. Therefore the Council could not
24 lawfully define its "No Action Alternative" as the unlawful, invalid and previously set aside 2013 Delta

25 Plan.

26 80. Alternative 1 - Reduced Reliance on the Delta Emphasis - is inadequate because it does
27 little to reduce the existing excessive level of exports of fresh water from the Delta. As noted above,
28 Alternative 1 takes only a tiny step toward the substantial export reductions that are necessary to halt the

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR 'DECLARATORY AND INJ UNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES • 24 -

1 Delta's free fall into ecological oblivion. Yet the Delta Reform Act makes clear the Legislature's intent
2 that the ecological "crisis" in the Delta be reversed, by "restoring more natural flows" through the Delta.
3 Alternative 1 does nothing specifically to "restore more natural flows," and requires only insubstantial
4  reductions in export levels 5 percent in below normal, dry and critically dry years when the Delta's
5 flows are most in need of restoration. (PEIR at 9-24.) Therefore it does not provide by itself a reasonable
6 range of alternatives intended to achieve the Delta Reform Act's purposes.

7 81. Alternative 2 - Delta Wetland Restoration Emphasis - likewise fails to provide sufficient
8 restoration of "natural flows" through the Delta. It would increase the average Delta outflow-inflow ratio
9 in dry and critically dry years to just 0.6 (compared to 0.5 for the Proposed Project) to be achieved by
10 (2030 (PEIR at 9-31) and increase the native inshore fish community only 5 percentage points more than
11 the Proposed Project - the DPA (id.). For this reason, Alternative 2, like Alternative 1, does not represent
12 a reasonable range of alternatives that reduce the DPA's environmental impacts consistent with achieving
13 the Delta Reform Act's purposes of restoring the Delta's "natural flows" to historic conditions, let alone
14 |recovering its ecological health including natural fish populations.

15 82. Alternative 3 -- Through-Delta Conveyance Emphasis - like Alternatives 1 and 2, fails to

16 provide for restoration of "natural flows" through the Delta. Instead, it would "focus[] on improvements
17 to water conveyance through the Delta .. that would modify existing water conveyance infrastructure
18 and construct new water conveyance infrastructure, and develop additional ground water and surface
19 water storage." (PEIR at 9-36.) Consequently, it likewise fails to provide a reasonable range of
20 lalternatives that would feasibly reduce the DPA's impacts, as required by CEQA, and fails to achieve the
21 Delta Reform Act's statutory mandates for restoration of the Delta.

22 83. Because none of its alternatives substantially reduce the existing level of excessive
23 jexports, and none restore the Delta's "natural flows," the PEIR failed to analyze a reasonable range of
24 alternatives as CEQA requires.

25 84. The PEIR failed to prepare and analyze mitigation measures to address the Project's
26 myriad significant impacts. Instead, the PEIR presented only vague descriptions of potential mitigation
27 measures. Rather than analyzing new measures designed to address the specific impacts of the DPA (and
28 WaterFix), the PEIR merely copied the 2013 PEIR's deficient mitigation measures, which were

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES 25 -

1 developed for a different project under different environmental conditions, and never tied them to specific
2 Iproject impacts of the DPA. (PEIR at ES-25 to ES-112.) Nor did it evaluate, let alone demonstrate, their
3 efficacy. (Id.) Because the PEIR fails to accurately identify and analyze the DPA's substantial impacts
4on the Delta's natural flows - let alone its more nuanced impacts on fish and wildlife populations and
5 health - it fails to mitigate those impacts adequately.

6 85. The Delta Reform Act requires the Delta Plan to be a legally enforceable, "long term"
7 |management plan for the Delta. (Water Code § 85020(a).) Yet the Council failed to adequately consider
8 the long-term environmental impacts of the planned construction of a Delta freshwater conveyance
9 facility of the magnitude contemplated in the very WaterFix that the DPA was clearly designed to allow.
10 The failure to consider a reasonable range of alternatives to such a massive diversion facility, or to
11 consider what mitigation measures might be feasible to reduce or avoid its foreseeable impacts, violates

12 the Council's CEQA duty to consider alternatives and mitigation measures that would avoid or reduce the
13 Project's significant impacts.

14 86. The No Project Alternative and the Council's description of existing conditions do not
15 adequately describe potentially catastrophic impacts to fish populations if the status quo continues. They
16 also fail to adequately describe the consequences or likelihood of a failure to meet water quality
17 |standards. The No Project Alternative "must be straightforward and intelligible, assisting the decision
18 maker and the public in ascertaining the environmental consequences of doing nothing." (Planning
19 Conservation League v. Department of Water Resources (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 892, 911.) Like the rest
20 of the alternatives, the No Project Alternative is tainted to prevent informed decisionmaking.

21 87. The PEIR's discussion of alternatives and mitigation measures also fails to meet CEQA's
22 requirements due to the Council's overall failure to produce a CEQA document that coherently analyzes
23 the policies and actions contemplated by the Delta Plan Amendments. The PEIR's vague discussion of

24 the DPA's project purpose and objectives, lack of an effective project description, and incomplete
25 |impacts analysis makes the promulgation of effective, concrete mitigation measures and alternatives
26 virtually impossible.

27 The PEIR Lacks an Adequate Cumulative Impacts Assessment

28 88. An EIR must discuss cumulative impacts when a "project's incremental effect is

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES - 26 -

1 cumulatively considerable." (Guidelines § 15130(a).) A "cumulative impact" refers to "two or more
2 individual effects which, when considered together, are considerable or which compound or increase
3 other environmental impacts." (Guidelines § 15355.) "Cumulative impacts can result from individually
4 minor but collectively significant projects taking place over a period of time." (Guidelines § 15355(b).)
5 The cumulative impacts discussion must include either a "list of past, present, and probable future
6 projects producing related or cumulative impacts," or "a summary of projections contained in an adopted"
7 broader plan "that describes or evaluates the conditions contributing to the cumulative effect."
8 (Guidelines § 15130(b).) "The Agency must interpret this requirement in such a way as to "afford the
9 fullest possible protection of the environment." (Friends of the Eel River v. Sonoma County Water
10 Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 859, 868-869, quoting Citizens Assn. for Sensible Development of Bishop
11 Área v. County of Inyo (1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 151, 168.)

12 89. Contrary to these requirements, the PEIR fails to adequately assess the Project's
13 |cumulative impacts. (PEIR at 7-1 to 7-43.) First, because the PEIR's analysis of the DPA's impacts is
14 too vague to be useful, its similarly vague cumulative impacts analysis is necessarily inadequate. Without
15 fully describing and analyzing the DPA's impacts, the PEIR could not adequately identify and analyze its
16 cumulative impacts. The cumulative impacts assessment is plagued by meaningless generalities such as:

17 operation of conveyance projects could result in direct impacts on special-status fish

18 species. Operation of these facilities that modify operations of the CVP, SWP, or other water systems, might affect special-status species depending on the extent to which the

19 operation influences the flows in connecting rivers or streams. Changes in water operations could result in impingement or entrainment of special-status fish species.

20 * * *

21 Construction and operation of facilities, such as water intakes and pumping plants, located

22 along waterways could cause long-term or permanent interruptions to migratory fish habitat corridors. Depending on the types of facilities constructed and their operational

23 criteria, operations could block or delay migration or movement of migratory fish species. Alteration of flow patterns and water quality in the Delta or its tributaries could also

24 disrupt migratory cues for these species.

25 (PEIR at 7-16.) Such vague statements about undefined "changes" that "could" occur "depending on the
26 Itypes of facilities constructed and their operational criteria" are entirely unhelpful.

27 90. Second, the PEIR entirely fails to identify and discuss the potential impacts of the
28 WaterFix and its diversion of 9000 cfs (or more) of water away from the Sacramento River upstream of

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES 27 -

1 the Delta. The PEIR does not analyze how these withdrawals will affect upstream reservoir operations, or
2 how regulations related to the reservoirs and tunnels will affect Project operations. In Friends of the Eel
3 |River (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 859, 871, the court held that the EIR's cumulative impacts discussion was
4 insufficient because it failed to acknowledge that curtailed diversions from the Eel River into the Russian
5 River could cause the Sonoma County Water Agency to fail to "supply water to its customers in an
6 environmentally sound way." Likewise, in County of Amador v. El Dorado County Water Agency (1999)
7 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 953, the court rejected an EIR because it failed to "demonstrate the timing, location
8 and amount of water releases from the upper watershed lakes and analyze the resulting lake levels"
9 occasioned by the downstream water project's proposed diversions. The PEIR's failure to fully
10 lacknowledge and discuss the likely effects on operation of upstream reservoirs such as Oroville, Shasta
11 and Trinity of the WaterFix's downstream operations frustrates the public's ability to understand the DPA
12 and its impacts, and has led to an inadequate range of alternatives, as discussed above. These omissions
13 Iviolate CEQA.

14 The EIR Uses the Wrong Baseline

15 91. "To decide whether a given project's environmental effects are likely to be significant, the
16 agency must use some measure of the environment's state absent the project, a measure sometimes
17 referred to as the 'baseline' for environmental analysis." (Communities for a Better Environment v. South
18 | Coast Unified Air Quality Management District (2010) 48 Cal.4th 310, 315 ("CBE').) "Normally" this
19 baseline is the "physical environmental conditions in the vicinity of the project, as they exist at the time
20 the notice of preparation is published," Guidelines section 15125(a), because "normally" the
21 "environmental condition[] in the vicinity of the project" is "the environment's state absent the project."
22 (Id.; CBE, 48 Cal.4th at 315.)

23 92. Here, by contrast, the Council is not explicitly proposing any specific facilities - although,
24 as noted, it has reverse-engineered its review to accommodate the WaterFix. Instead, the PEIR states that
25 "the proposed Delta Plan Amendments (Proposed Project . . .) does not involve construction or operation
26 of specific physical actions following adoption of the proposed amendments." (PEIR at 5.1-1.) The
27 PEIR even claims - ignoring the WaterFix elephant under the rug - that "it is difficult to anticipate
28 specific projects that would be implemented as a result of the Proposed Project's policies and

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR 'DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIER AND ATTORNEYS' FEES • 28 -

1 recommendations." (Id.) Even if this head-in-the-sand claim were true, it remains the case that the
2 Council is reviewing the continued viability (and impacts) of exporting large volumes of water from the
3 Delta whose removal is devastating the Delta's public trust resources. The Delta Reform Act succinctly

4 acknowledges that the Delta is "in crisis." (Water Code § 85001(a).) As part of its statutory command to
5 restore the Delta's beleaguered environment, the Council had a duty to consider the alternative of
6 reducing the existing high level of Delta water exports to mitigate their environmental impacts. But
7 instead of seizing an obvious opportunity to reduce environmental harm, the Council ignored it.

8 93. The Council's "[f]orfeiture of that opportunity is an action, rather than a perpetuation of
9 the status quo. Put differently, an agency may not escape its duty by ignoring that duty and then
10 presenting the result as a fait accompli incorporated into an environmental baseline." (League to Save
11 Lake Tahoe v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (E.D.Cal. 2010) 739 F.Supp.2d 1260, 1276 (affirmed in
12 part and reversed in part, 469 F.App'x 621 (9th Cir. 2012).) As part of its indisputably broad authority to

13 reconsider the environmental consequences of Delta exports, the Council should have considered those
14 Iconsequences afresh. Instead, the Council ignored all of these impacts by finding them to be part of the
15 CQA baseline.

16 94. By using a baseline that improperly incorporated the environmental consequences of
17 continuing excessive Delta diversions into the Project, the Council violated CEQA.

18 The EIR Improperly Segments Environmental Review

19 95. CEQA requires agencies to prepare EIRs regarding the impacts of "projects" that may
20 have significant environmental impacts. (Guidelines § 15064(a)(1).) CEQA defines "project" to mean

21 "the whole of an action." (Guidelines § 15378(a).) "The term 'project' refers to the activity which is
22 being approved and which may be subject to several discretionary approvals by governmental agencies.
23 The term 'project' does not mean each separate governmental approval." (Guidelines § 15378(c).)
24 Accordingly, agencies "must consider the whole of an action, not simply its constituent parts, when
25 determining whether [the action] will have a significant environmental effect (Citizens Assoc. for
26 Sensible Development of Bishop Area v. County of Inyo (1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 151)." (Guidelines §
27 15003(h).)

28 96. CEQA thus intends to ensure "that environmental considerations do not become

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR "DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES 29 -

submerged by chopping a large project into many little ones - each with a minimal potential impact on
2 the environment - which cumulatively may have disastrous consequences." (Bozung v. Local Agency V.
3 [Formation Com. (1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 283-284.)

4 97. The PEIR recognizes that the WaterFix is at least an "Example Project[] for Conveyance"
5 that might conceivably be implemented. (PEIR at 4-14 to 4-15 (emphasis added).) But since DWR had
6 already approved the WaterFix more than three months before the Draft PEIR was released on November
7 1, 2017, the Council should have addressed its impacts specifically and in detail so as to alert the public
8 to the foreseeable impacts of the DPA. CEQA requires that each agency "must use its best efforts to find
9 out and disclose all that it reasonably can." (Guidelines § 15144.) And, it must disclose the "reasonably
10 foreseeable probable future projects." (Guidelines §§ 15355(b).)

11 98. The PEIR should have analyzed the particular conveyance facilities selected as part of the
12 /WaterFix approval because they are foreseeable and will substantially affect the impacts that arise from
13 implementation of the DPA. The public has a right to know, for example, what environmental restoration
14 measures would be needed if the WaterFix tunnels were to be built, the extent to which global warming
15 and sea level rise could affect water deliveries through the tunnels in comparison to other conveyance
16 methods, which conveyance methods best achieve the Delta Reform Act's goals, and how the chosen
17 conveyance method will affect implementation of the Delta Plan. The PEIR answers none of these
18 |questions.

19 99. By only tangentially mentioning the WaterFix as a generalized "example" of a type of
20 project that might occur rather than analyzing it in detail, the Council violated CEQA.

21 The Council's Responses to Comments Are Inadequate

22 100. CEQA requires that the Council provide detailed responses to comments that raise
23 significant environmental issues. (Guidelines : 15088.) The Council's responses must show a "good
24 faith, reasoned analysis," and must be supported by factual information. (Id.; Laurel Heights
25 Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of California (1993) 6 Cal.4th 1112, 1124.)

26 101. If a comment raises significant environmental issues and the agency chooses not to accept

27 lits suggestions, the agency must explain why. (Guidelines § 15088(c); Flanders Foundation v. City of
28 Carmel-by-the-Sea (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 603, 615.) Meaningful agency response to public comment is

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR "DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES .30 -

1 fundamental to CEQA's informational purpose. For this reason, a failure to adequately respond to
2 Icomments renders an EIR "fatally defective." (People v. County of Kern (1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 830,
3 842.)

4 102. The Council failed to respond to numerous comments by improperly dismissing them as
"a comment addressing the merits of the Proposed Project and the implementation of the Delta Plan,
6 rather than the adequacy and content of the Draft PEIR." (PEIR at 3-339.) For example, petitioners
7 commented that the Draft PEIR's "objectives unreasonably narrow the focus of the PEIR" and that
8 l"[u]nder CEQA, [the Council] must also consider a reasonable range of alternatives that are capable of
9 meeting the goals of the Delta Reform Act while lessening the impacts of the WaterFix." (Final PEIR at
10 Letter OR 4-3.) The Council declined to address this CEQA issue. (Id.) Instead the Council simply
11 deemed all comments that even indirectly related to the Delta Plan Amendments themselves (as opposed
12 to only the DEIR in isolation) to warrant no response, in violation of CEQA's informational purpose.

13 103. The Council's failure to provide a "good faith, reasoned analysis in response" to public
14 comment violated CEQA. (Guidelines § 15088(c).)

15 The Council's Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations

16 Are Not Supported by Substantial Evidence

17 104. If a project will have "significant environmental effects," CEQA requires the agency to
18 make "one or more written findings for each of those significant effects, accompanied by a brief
19 explanation of the rationale for each finding." (Guidelines § 15091(a).) There are three "possible
20 Ifindings":

21 (1) Changes or alterations have been required in, or incorporated into, the project which avoid

22 or substantially lessen the significant environmental effect . ..

23 (2) Such changes or alterations are within the responsibility and jurisdiction of another public agency and .. have been adopted . or can and should be adopted by such other agency.

24 (3) Specific economic, legal, social, technological, or other considerations . make infeasible
the mitigation measures or project alternatives identified in the final EIR.
25

26 (Guidelines §15091(a); PRC § 21081(a).) The findings "shall be supported by substantial evidence in the
27 record." (Guidelines § 15091(b).) Where, as here, an agency approves a project that has significant
28 environmental effects that "are not avoided or substantially lessened," the agency must "state in writing

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES •31 -

1 the specific reasons to support its action." (Guidelines §§ 15093(b); 15096(h), 15064(a)(2).) This
2 statement of overriding considerations shall be supported by substantial evidence," Guidelines section
3 15093(b), and is to be made in addition to the findings required under section 15091. (Guidelines §
4 15091(f).)

5 105. Requiring such findings and, when necessary, a statement of overriding considerations,
6 ensures that the agency carefully considers the proposed action's environmental effects and makes its
7 decisionmaking process transparent. The "intended effect is to facilitate orderly analysis and minimize
8 the likelihood that the agency will randomly leap from evidence to conclusions." (Topanga Assn. for a
9 Scenic Com. V. County of Los Angeles (1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 516-517.) Since they lay out the agency's
10 rationale, findings also help courts to police agency compliance with CEQA's required procedures. (Mira
11 Mar Mobile Com. v. City of Oceanside (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 477, 496 (noting that "findings must
12 bridge the analytic gap between the raw evidence and ultimate decision,' so as to allow a reviewing court
13 "to trace and examine the agency's mode of analysis") (citation omitted).)

14 106. In order to make the findings required under CEQA, the PEIR must properly identify and
15 fully analyze the Delta Plan's myriad significant environmental impacts. As discussed above, the PEIR
16 completely fails to do so. The Council's CEQA findings, which are based on this impacts analysis, are
17 therefore necessarily defective.

18 107. Likewise, the PEIR fails to consider alternatives such as substantially reduced Delta
19 jexports that would feasibly attain most of the Project's objectives of "sustainable management" to restore
20 and protect the Delta's ecologic health while providing a "more reliable water supply for the state" to
21 meet consumptive needs. Where, as here, an agency has failed to determine whether there are feasible
22 lalternatives that would avoid project's. significant environmental impacts (or reduce them to
23 insignificance), its contrary findings are "necessarily invalid." (Uphold Our Heritage v. Town of
24 Woodside (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 587, 603; City of Marina v. Board of Trustees of California State
25 University (2006) 39 Cal.4th 341, 368.)

26 108. Moreover, the Council's findings and statement of overriding consideration lack
27 substantial evidentiary support. This omission violates CEQA. (PRC §§ 21081.5; Guidelines §§
28 (15091(b), 15093(b).)

1 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Violation of the 2009 Delta Reform Act)

3 (Alleged by All Petitioners Against All Respondents)

109. The paragraphs set forth above are realleged and incorporated herein by reference.

5 Since the 2013 Delta Plan Was Invalid and Set Aside, the Council's Attempted Amendment of It Is Likewise Invalid.
6

7 110. The 2013 Delta Plan was set aside as "invalid" by the Sacramento Superior Court because
8 it violated the Delta Reform Act. (Judgment filed October 21, 2016 in North Coast Rivers Alliance v.
9 Delta Stewardship Council, JCCP No. 4758 at 2, 12.) The 2013 Delta Plan remains invalid. The
10 (Superior Court has never altered its Judgment, and no appellate court has disturbed it. Nor has the
11 Council ever filed a Return to the Court "setting forth what it has done to comply with the [Court's
12 Peremptory] Writ [of Mandate]." (Id. at 3, 16.) Nor has the Superior Court ever "issue[d] an Order
13 discharging its Peremptory Writ of Mandate." (Id.) Because the 2013 Delta Plan remains invalid and set
14 aside, the Council's purported adoption of "Amendments" to that invalid 2013 Delta Plan is, perforce,
15 ultra vires. Surgery - even assuming adequate CEQA review - cannot resurrect a corpse. Accordingly,
16 the DPA is likewise invalid and of no force and effect.

17 The DPA Is Invalid in any Event Because It Violates the Delta Reform Act.

18 111. The Delta Reform Act requires the Council to achieve the coequal goals of (1)
19 I"sustainable management of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta ecosystem;" (2) "a more reliable water
20 supply for the state;" (3) "protect[ing] and enhanc[ing] the quality of water supply from the Delta;" and
21 |(4) "establish[ing] a governance structure that will direct efforts across state agencies to develop a legally
22 enforceable Delta Plan." (Water Code § 85001.) The Delta Reform Act's goals highlight the need to
23 achieve "sustainable management" of the Delta's ecosystem to "protect and enhance the quality of water
24 supply from the Delta." But rather than furthering these goals mandated by the Legislature, the Delta
25 Plan Amendments create obstacles to protecting and enhancing water quality and achieving sustainable
26 management in order to increase the export of water for consumption.

27 112. The first of the Delta Reform Act's three principal management tasks is to specifically
28 identify and correct the mismanagement practices that caused the Delta's ecological collapse. The Act

I VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR 'DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES 33 -

1 declares that "existing Delta policies are not sustainable" and that "[r]esolving the crisis requires
2 fundamental reorganization of the state's management of Delta watershed resources." (Water Code !
3 85001(a).) To this end, the Act requires in Water Code section 85086 that the State Water Board develop
4 "an effective system of Delta watershed diversion data collection and public reporting," and "determine
5 |instream flow needs of the Delta for the purpose of facilitating the [Council's] planning decisions that are
6 required to achieve the objectives of the Delta Plan." (Id. at (a), (b).) The State Water Board is
7 specifically directed, "pursuant to its public trust obligations, [to] develop new flow criteria for the Delta
8 ecosystem necessary to protect public trust resources." (Water Code section 85086(c)(1).) The Board is
9 forbidden from approving any "change in the point of diversion of the [SWP] or [CVP] from the southern
10 Delta to a point on the Sacramento River" unless it "shall include appropriate Delta flow criteria and shall
11 be informed by the analysis conducted" in developing the public trust flow criteria. (Water Code
12 85086(c)(2).) The WaterFix requires a "change in the point of diversion" of the SWP and CVP from the
13 South Delta to the Sacramento River and thus may not be approved unless it is "informed by the analysis"
14 set forth in the State Water Board's public trust flow criteria.

15 113. Notwithstanding this clear statutory mandate, and contrary to the Council's duty to restore
16 the Delta's "natural flows" as necessary to restore and protect the Delta's public trust resources, the
17 Council purported to adopt the DPA without awaiting the State Water Board's completion of its analysis
18 regarding the public trust flow criteria required by Water Code section 85086(c). Indeed, the DPA, like
19 |the Delta Plan before it; entirely fails even to acknowledge past mismanagement of public trust resources,
20 let alone identify and rectify its causes. The DPA's failure to address the causal relationship between
21 lexcessive diversions and ecologic disaster skews the DPA away from both the causes of the Delta's most
22 fundamental problems and their solutions. The DPA has thus betrayed the Legislature's clear command
23 that the Council acknowledge and correct decades of Delta mismanagement.

24 114. As an additional safeguard to prevent approval of massive diversions from the Delta
25 similar to those that have wreaked such ecological havoc in the past, the Legislature adopted detailed
26 criteria for approval of the WaterFix's predecessor, the so-called Bay Delta Conservation Plan ("BDCP").
27 In Water Code section 85320(b), the Legislature directed that "[t]he BDCP shall not be incorporated into

1  unless the BDCP does all of the following: (1) Complies with [the Natural Community Conservation
2 Planning Act] commencing with section 28000 .. . of the Fish and Game Code.. .." Because of
3 objections from state and federal fisheries agencies, the WaterFix does not qualify as a 'Natural
4 Community Conservation Plan." (Final PEIR at 3-5.) Consequently, the WaterFix may not be
5 "incorporated into the Delta Plan" and is not "eligible for state funding." (Water Code § 85320(b).) Yet
6 contrary to these clear statutory prohibitions, the Council has reverse-engineered the DPA to, in effect,
7 allow the WaterFix to proceed absent compliance with the Legislature's mandate that it conform to the
g criteria for adoption of a Natural Community Conservation Plan. Together with the Council's failure to
9 lawait completion of the State Water Board's adoption of public trust flow criteria as mandated by Water

10 Code section 85086(c), the Council has directly contravened the Legislature's prescribed procedures for
11 restoring and protecting the Delta's public trust resources.

12 115. The DPA is required by the Delta Reform Act to further the coequal goals of ecosystem
13 restoration and water supply reliability. But the DPA treats the ecosystem restoration goal not as coequal,
14 but as secondary to and of lesser importance than the goal of ensuring water supply reliability -
15 particularly for large agricultural contractors south of the Delta. By paving the way for the WaterFix
16 despite its planned massive and ecologically harmful diversions, the Council abdicated its responsibility
17 to restore and protect the Delta ecosystem.

18 116. "The policy of the State of California is to reduce reliance on the Delta in meeting
19 California's future water supply needs through a statewide strategy of investing in improved regional
20 supplies, conservation, and water use efficiency." (Water Code § 85021 (emphasis added).) This
21 objective is the second of three principal features of the Delta Reform Act. (Water Code §§ 85020,
22 85021, 85023.) But because the DPA does not substantially reduce export levels as shown above, it
23 violates the Legislature's clear mandate to reduce reliance on the Delta's water supplies and increase
24 reliance on surface and ground water supplies elsewhere.

25 117. The DPA also fails to adopt and implement the eight specific policy objectives mandated
26 lby the Legislature in Water Resources Code section 85020, the third principal feature of the Delta Reform
27 Act. Those objectives require a host of actions intended to restore the Delta, including recovery of "its
28 fisheries and wildlife, as the heart of a healthy estuary and wetland ecosystem," protection of the "unique

1 cultural, recreational, and agricultural values of the California Delta," and improved "statewide water
2 conservation, water use efficiency, and sustainable water use" as necessary to "reduce reliance on the
3 Delta in meeting California's future water supply needs." (Water Code §§ 85020(b), (c), (d), 85021.)
4 The DPA fails to include specific implementation measures that will promote recovery of a healthy Delta
5 ecosystem while providing a reliable water supply, improved water conservation, and better water use
6 lefficiency, as required by Water Code sections 85302 and 85303. The DPA also fails to utilize the "best
7 available scientific information," include "quantified or otherwise measurable targets" to achieve its
8 objectives, and provide for continuing monitoring and data collection to assure that its management
9 measures do in fact achieve ecosystem restoration, as required by Water Code sections 85211 and 85308.
10 Rather than developing specific management steps and enforceable standards to achieve the Legislature's
11 enumerated goals, the DPA presents only generalized discussions of these topics that ignore the
12 devastating impacts that the WaterFix's diversion of water underneath the Delta will cause. The Council
13 has thus sidestepped its primary responsibility to translate the Legislature's clear policy objectives into
14 specific and enforceable management measures and performance standards.
15 118. By failing to meet any of the principal requirements of the Delta Reform Act in its
16 development and approval of the DPA, the Council has violated the Delta Reform Act.

17 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

18 (Violation of the Public Trust Doctrine)
19 (Alleged by All Petitioners Against All Respondents)
20 119. The paragraphs set forth above are realleged and incorporated herein by reference.
21 120. Water Code section 85023 states, "the longstanding constitutional principle of reasonable
22 use and the Public Trust Doctrine shall be the foundation of state water management policy and are
23 particularly important and applicable to the Delta." The PEIR recognizes that compliance with the Public
24 Trust Doctrine is required by the Delta Reform Act. (PEIR at 5.11-157, citing Water Code § 85023.)
25 121. In National Audubon Society v. Superior Court (1983) 33 Cal.3d 419, 426, the court noted
26 that the public trust doctrine mandates that "before state courts and agencies approve water diversions
27 they.. consider the effect of such diversions upon interests protected by the public trust, and attempt, so
28 far as feasible, to avoid or minimize any harm to those interests." The National Audubon Society Court

VERIPIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEYS' FEES • 36 -

1 went on to explain:

2 Just as the history of this state shows that appropriation may be necessary for efficient use of

3 water despite unavoidable harm to public trust values, it demonstrates that an appropriative water rights system administered without consideration of the public trust may cause unnecessary and unjustified harm to trust interests. As a matter of practical necessity the state
4 may have to approve appropriations despite foreseeable harm to public trust uses. In so doing, however, the state must bear in mind its duty as trustee to consider the effect of the taking on 5 the public trust, and to preserve, so far as consistent with the public interest, the uses protected by the trust.

8 122. "Public trust easements are traditionally defined in terms of navigation, commerce and
9 fisheries. They have been held to include the right to fish, hunt, bathe, swim, to use for boating and
10 lgeneral recreation purposes the navigable waters of the state, and to use the bottom of the navigable
11 waters for anchoring, standing, or other purposes." (Marks v. Whitney (1971) 6 Cal.3d 251, 259.)
12 For nearly 50 years it has been settled law in California that public trust values also "encompass{] . the
13 preservation of those lands in their natural state, SO that they may serve as ecological units for scientific
14 study, as open space, and as environments which provide food and habitat for birds and marine life, and
15 which favorably affect the scenery and climate of the area." (Id.)

16 123. Implementation of the DPA will adversely affect numerous public trust resources. As the
17 PEIR and the Council's CEQA findings explain, the chosen alternative will harm wetlands, riparian
18 vegetation, special-status species, and recreational activities, among other public trust resources.

19 124. With regard to impacts on public trust resources, the Council failed to consider and adopt
20 an alternative that would substantially reduce diversions sufficiently to restore the Delta's public trust
21 resources including its fish and wildlife.

22 125. By ignoring and rejecting alternatives that would substantially reduce exports from the
23 Delta and thus restore public trust resources to a far greater extent than is even claimed for the approved
24 DPA, the Council abdicated its statutory and constitutional obligation to preserve public trust resources to
25 the maximum extent feasible, based on a fair and fully informed balancing of the impacts of these
26 alternatives on public trust resources.

Un 126. Project Approvals as Contrary to C.C.P. §§ 1085 and 1094.5)

6 (Alleged by All Petitioners Against All Respondents)

127. The paragraphs set forth above are realleged and incorporated herein by reference.
The Council proceeded in excess of its jurisdiction and abused its discretion in purporting
7 to approve the DPA and certify its PEIR because such approvals violate CCP sections 1085 and 1094.5 in
8 the following respects, among others:

a.

10 law;

11 b. such approvals were not granted in accordance with the procedures required by

12 C.

13 before the Council. such approvals were not based on the findings required by law; and

14 128. such approvals were not based on, or were contrary to, the evidence in the record

15 jamong others:

16 The Council failed to proceed in the manner required by law in the following respects,

a.

17 b.

18 the Council violated CEQA as alleged hereinabove;

C. the Council violated the Delta Reform Act; and

-19 129. the Council violated the Public Trust Doctrine.

The Council's actions in approving the Delta Plan without complying with the procedures
20 required by CCP sections 1085 and 1094.5 exceeded the Council's jurisdiction and constitute a
21 lprejudicial abuse of discretion, and therefore are invalid and must be set aside.
