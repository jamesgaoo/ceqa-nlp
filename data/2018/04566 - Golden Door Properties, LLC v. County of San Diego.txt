SAN DIEGO COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY
RELIEF

- Petitioner and Plaintiff Golden Door Properties, LLC, (the "Golden Door" or
2 "Petitioner") brings its Verified Petition for Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

3

4 for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief (the "Petition") against Respondent and Defendant

5 County of San Diego (the "County") and alleges as follows:

I. INTRODUCTION

6 1. Pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), the
7 County approved enforceable mitigation measures for impacts from greenhouse gas

8

9 ("GHG") emissions as part of its 2011 General Plan Update. These adopted CEQA
mitigation measures set forth requirements for an orderly and comprehensive method of
10 measuring and analyzing GHG impacts. One of these important measures is Mitigation

11

12 Measure (or "MM") CC-1.2, which, as amended, requires the County to prepare a

13 Climate Action Plan ("CAP") to achieve "reduction of community-wide (i.e.,

14 unincorporated County) and County Operations greenhouse gas emissions." Similarly,
the General Plan, as amended, requires the County to achieve "reduction of community-
15 wide (i.e., unincorporated County) and County Operations greenhouse gas

16 2. emissions."

This lawsuit challenges the County's compliance with its General Plan and
17 with CEQA, to the extent that the County has failed, in its newly adopted CAP, to adhere

18

19 to requirements to achieve "reduction of community-wide (i.e., unincorporated County)

20 and County Operations greenhouse gas emissions" and other legal requirements.
3.

21 Though the County made considerable and positive progress in recently
adopting the new CAP and related General Plan amendmentsin particular requiring a
22 reduction in community-wide (i.e., unincorporated County) GHG emissions-it also

23 made a serious and prejudicial error. In short, the County's primary error was adopting a
24 program for carbon offsets that would allow in-process and future General Plan
25 amendment projects to increase GHG emissions within the County, in exchange for the
26 purchase of carbon offset credits applicable to another location in California, the United

27 States, or the world, without considering requirements of the General Plan (even as
28 amended) or undertaking the appropriate analysis to understand the effect of this

RELIEF

- program. The approvals under these circumstances violated the General Plan's
2 requirements to reduce GHG emissions within the County and also violated CEQA. This
3 policy choice to allow increased local GHG emissions in exchange for emissions

4

5 reductions in other locations across the State, nation, and world was not required by the

6 County's 2011 General Plan or General Plan environmental impact report ("EIR"). It is a

new

7 proposal that was not considered as part of the County's previous attempt to approve

8 a CAP (which was set aside as a result of litigation) and has been included with the 2018

9 CAP without any analysis of this program's own environmental impacts.
4. Under the appropriate circumstances, a transparent, verifiable, and
10 enforceable program for carbon offset credits and off-site GHG mitigation projects may

11 be an effective strategy to mitigate GHG emissions. Petitioner recognizes that
12 fundamentally the Board of Supervisors may, if it has complied with all applicable laws

13

14 and regulations, make the policy choice regarding whether and under what conditions

15 GHG offset credits derived from locations outside of the County may be used. However,

16 the County's policy choice must be consistent with the requirements that the County

17 already established in the 2011 General Plan and affirmed in its recent amendments to the

18 General Plan, in particular in new amendments to the General Plan's Conservation and
Open Space Element.

19 5. In other words, the County, under different circumstances, potentially could
20 have chosen as a matter of public policy to ignore increases in community-wide GHG

21 emissions SO long as there were offsets for the increases located somewhere else in the
22 world-but that is not what the County's General Plan allows. This policy choice must

23

24 also be consistent other applicable state and regional requirements (such as those of the
California Air Resources Board or "CARB").

25 6.

26 Similarly, where the law permits the County to make a policy choice that
may be inconsistent with state and/or regional policies, at the very least, the County must
27 analyze and disclose the inconsistencies with those policies, e.g., fully disclose under
28 CEQA how the offset credit policy will affect regional transportation planning, vehicle

-

2 miles traveled, etc., formulated by the San Diego Association of Governments
("SANDAG").

3 7.

4 In violation of CEQA, the County failed to produce an adequate

5 informational document that disclosed and analyzed the potential environmental impacts

6 of this new offset program. County staff, for whatever reason, did not want to be explicit
or transparent that its new global offset policy would not be consistent with the General
7 Plan and did not want to analyze consistency with CARB's and SANDAG's related GHG

8

9 policies. By allowing in-process and future General Plan amendment projects to
exchange increases in GHG emissions within the County for purported decreases in GHG
10 emissions elsewhere in the County, State, nation, or the world, among

11 other things, this

12 new carbon offset program might result in the development of unplanned urban sprawl
throughout the County. Resulting impacts (in addition to GHG emissions) may include
13 increasing vehicle miles traveled ("VMT") and impacts to traffic, noise, air quality,

14 energy consumption, and environmental justice. But the public was not adequately
15 informed. These impacts should have been-but were not--adequately disclosed or
16 analyzed by the County. The supplemental EIR ("SEIR") prepared by the County also

17 failed to conduct the analysis necessary to adequately inform the public as to the
18 feasibility and enforceability of this new offset program.

19 8. The process the County set up for this new offset program was also legally
20 improper under CEQA. While the County may have the policy choice about whether and

21 to what extent it wanted to adopt a CEQA feasibility requirement for "on-site GHG
22 reductions" before allowing external or global offsets, County staff explicitly embraced

23 the CEQA provisions regarding feasibility and told the public and County
24 decisionmakers that they would use the CEQA provisions regarding feasibility as part of

25

26 the review of any project. "Feasibility" is a defined term under CEQA and carries with it
specific legal requirements. In relying on CEQA's "feasibility" definition, County staff
27 established a procedure that conflicted with CEQA's feasibility requirements, so that
28 feasibility determinations would be made by County staff outside of the County's state

LATHAM&WATKINSUP 4

-

2 law CEQA process, and outside of the County's regular public hearings and project

3 approvals by the Planning Commission or Board of Supervisors. In other words, the

4 County may not have been required a to use a feasibility standard under CEQA in this
situation, but having chosen to do so, it cannot create a CEQA feasibility determination
5 process that violates state law requirements.

6 9. The Golden Door applauds much of the County's new CAP and related
7 approvals, in particular the amendments to the General Plan that further commit the

8

9 County to the "reduction of community-wide (i.e., unincorporated County) and County

10 Operations greenhouse gas emissions." However, the County's concurrent effort to evade

11 this requirement- in particular through its unlimited global carbon offset program-

12 violates the law and requires judicial intervention to obtain compliance with the General

13 Plan, CEQA, and the Planning and Zoning Law ("PZL"). The County's simultaneous

14 approval of the General Plan amendments requiring GHG emissions reductions within

15 the County along with its new scheme to allow for unlimited out-of-County offset credits
is disingenuous and prohibited by the law.

16 10.

17 Judicial intervention is particularly important in order to prevent

18 irreversible momentum towards the approval of currently in-process projects before the
County that will rely on the new offset program to analyze their GHG emissions. For
19 these in-process projects and future ones, the offset program is a necessary first step in a

20 chain of events that

21 II. PARTIES may culminate in an irreversible physical impact to the environment.

22 A. Petitioner Golden Door

23 11. Petitioner Golden Door is a California limited liability company, with its

24 principal place of business in San Diego County, California. The Golden Door is the
25 owner and operator of an award-winning hospitality and agricultural operation that
26 opened in 1958, situated on approximately 600 acres along Deer Springs Road in
27 northern San Diego County. It was the highest-rated establishment in Travel and
28 Leisure's recent list of the world's best destination spas.

LATHAM&WATKINS P 5

RELIEF

- 12. The Golden Door's guiding philosophy emphasizes harmony with the
2 environment in focusing on the health and fitness of its

3 guests. Its property encompasses
a peaceful array of hiking trails, luxurious spa amenities, tranquil Japanese gardens, and a
4 bamboo forest. The Golden Door engages in extensive local and sustainable agricultural
5 cultivation, including avocado groves and fresh vegetable gardens as well as citrus and

6 olive trees on its property. The Golden Door recently opened a roadside "Farm Stand" on
7 Deer Springs Road to sell its organic produce and other products to the general public.

8 13.

9 Like much of the public, as well as local, state, and federal governmental

10 agencies, the Golden Door is concerned about the effects of climate change. Changing

11 climate patterns could negatively affect the Golden Door's agricultural cultivation and

12 further affect the property's flora and fauna, which are an important part of the Golden

13 Door's guest experience. In addition, the Twin Oaks Valley area is subject to significant

14 wildfire risk, which is further exacerbated by global climate change. Similarly, the
Golden Door's guest experience and agricultural operations would also be affected by
15 unplanned development on unincorporated County lands. In particular, currently in
16 process before the County is the Newland Sierra project, an unplanned development
17

18 project for 2,135 residential units, 81,000 square feet of commercial development, a
charter school, and various parks and equestrian facilities in close proximity to
19 Petitioner's property. Petitioner is concerned that this project's location in rural Twin
20 Oaks Valley would require long single-occupant vehicle trips resulting in substantial

21

22 GHG emissions in violation of, among other laws and regulations, the County's General
Plan, CEQA, and the Planning and Zoning Law.

23 14. Accordingly, the Golden Door has a direct and beneficial interest in the
24 County's compliance with its General Plan, CEQA, PZL, and binding mitigation
25 measures and in ensuring a legally adequate GHG analysis for development proposals on
26 unincorporated County lands.

27 B. Respondent County

3 This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections

4 1060, 1085, and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5.

21. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing this Petition and
5 Complaint, including, but not limited to, exhausting all administrative remedies or

6 otherwise being excused from such requirement by futility, lack of jurisdiction, and/or the
7 unavailability of any other timely review, including without limitation the failure of the

8

9 County to provide prior public notice, public hearings, or proceedings before the Board

10 of Supervisors prior to the County's adoption of the 2018 CAP and related approvals.

22.

11 Venue is proper in this Court because the Respondent is located in the

12 County of San Diego and the violations of Petitioner's rights occurred in the County of
San Diego.

13 23.

14 Petitioner has standing to assert its claims because it has a material a interest
in ensuring that the effects of climate change are properly analyzed and mitigated for
15 development proposals on unincorporated County lands, including the Newland project.
16 Petitioner not only seeks to vindicate the substantial public interest in climate stability,
17 but to protect the future of its world-class resort and agricultural operation.

18 IV. STATEMENT OF FACTS

19 A.

20 State Legislative and Regulatory Efforts to Combat Climate Change

24. Climate change is a global issue that threatens California. According to
21 CARB's "California's 2017 Climate Change Scoping Plan" ("2017 Scoping Plan"), at p.

22 ES2:

23 In California, as in the rest of the world, climate change is

24 contributing to an escalation of serious problems, including raging wildfires, coastal erosion, disruption of water supply,

25 threats to agriculture, spread of insect-borne diseases, and continuing health threats from air pollution. The drought that

26 plagued California for years devastated the state's agricultural and rural communities, leaving some of them with no drinking

27 water at all. In 2015 alone, the drought cost agriculture in the Central Valley an estimated $2.7 billion, and more than 20.000

28 jobs. Last winter, the drought was broken by record-breaking rains, which led to flooding that tore through freeways, threatened rural communities, and isolated coastal areas. This

LATHAM&WATKINS.P 8

RELIEF

NP year, California experienced the deadliest wildfires in its history. Climate change is making events like these more

3 frequent, more catastrophic and more costly. Climate change impacts all Californians, and the impacts are often disproportionately borne by the state's most vulnerable and

4 disadvantaged populations.

5 25.

6 The 2017 Scoping Plan also indicates that climate change threatens

7 agriculture in California, which is "vulnerable to climate change." (Id. at p. 85.) Scientific

8 research shows that anthropogenic GHG emissions contribute to global climate change.
(Id. at p. 6)

9 26. The State of California has taken steps to address this global issue. In 2005,
10 former Governor Schwarzenegger issued Executive Order S-03-05, which set State goals

11 for reducing GHG emissions to specific levels by 2020 and 2050 (by 2020, reduce GHG
12 emissions to 1990 levels; by 2050, reduce GHG emissions to 80% below 1990 levels).

13

14 Executive Order S-3-05 was intended to represent California's fair share of worldwide

15 GHG reductions necessary to stabilize the climate and gave rise to Assembly Bill ("AB")
32, or the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006.

16 27.

17 AB 32 requires the State to lower its GHG emissions to 1990 emissions
levels by 2020, as determined by CARB. Specifically, AB 32 required CARB to
18 determine 1990 levels of GHG emissions and then to establish a "statewide greenhouse

19 gas emissions limit that is equivalent to that level, to be achieved by 2020." (Health &
20 Safety Code § 38550.)

21 28.

22 AB 32 also reflected that GHG reductions must continue after 2020, and

23 required that statewide GHG emissions limits established by CARB "remain in effect

24 until otherwise amended or appealed." (Health § & Safety Code § 38550(a).) Further, the
Legislature intended that the "statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit continue in

25 existence and be used to maintain and continue reductions in emissions beyond 2020."
26 (Id. at § 38550(b).)

27 29. Governor Jerry Brown and the Legislature have followed through on setting
28 post-2020 GHG emissions reduction goals. On April 29, 2015, Governor Brown signed

LATHAM&WATKINSW 9

ATTORNEYS AT LAW
SAN DIEGO VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY
RELIEF

-

2 Executive Order ("EO") B-30-15, which established a GHG emissions reduction target of

3 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. On September 8, 2016, Governor Brown signed into

4 law Senate Bill ("SB") 32, which codified GHG reduction targets set by EO B-30-15.

30. In addition, pursuant to SB 375, SANDAG prepared a Regional
5 Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy ("RTP/SCS") that links
6 transportation and land use planning in an effort reduce GHG emissions. The current
7 RTP/SCS, which SANDAG approved in 2015, plans for GHG emissions reductions and

8

9 establishes specific GHG reductions in the San Diego region of 15% per capita by 2020
and 21% per capita by 2035 from the transportation sector. The RTP/SCS intends to
10 accomplish these goals through coordinating transportation and land use planning.

11 SANDAG's RTP/SCS is based on growth projections pursuant to the County's General
12 Plan and does not account for unplanned development projects.

13 31. SANDAG's RTP/SCS notes that approximately half of its emissions
14 reductions would result from transit and transportation demand management projects,

15 while a quarter of the reductions result from changing land uses and a quarter from
16 increasing the cost of driving.

17 32. Further, the Governor's Office of Planning and Resources' proposed
18 guidelines for implementing SB 743 would require analysis of induced vehicle trips and

19 VMT from projects that expand roadways. CARB has identified VMT reduction as an
20 important aspect of GHG emissions reduction.

21 33. For example, in December 2017, CARB approved an updated Climate
22 Change Scoping Plan to address the use of GHG offset credits (the "2017 Scoping Plan").
23

24 The 2017 Scoping Plan emphasizes the importance of offset programs relying on local
projects for emissions offsets:

25

26 To the degree a project relies on GHG mitigation measures, CARB recommends that lead agencies prioritize on-site design

27 features that reduce emissions, especially from VMT, and direct investments in GHG reductions within the project's

28 region that contribute potential air quality, health, and economic co-benefits locally.

- 34.

2 CARB's 2017 Scoping Plan also emphasizes the need to address VMT as

3 an integral piece of GHG mitigation. "CARB staff is more convinced than ever that, in

4 addition to achieving GHG reductions from cleaner fuels and vehicles, California must

5 also reduce VMT." (CARB, 2017 Climate Change Scoping Plan at p. 101.) Further, the
2017 Scoping Plan emphasizes the co-benefits of VMT reduction, including reduction of
6 toxic air pollutants, improved public health, decreased traffic congestion, and increased
7 environmental justice.

8 35.

9 CARB staff has recommended increased GHG emissions reduction targets

under SB 375 for the State's metropolitan planning organizations ("MPOs") and has
10 emphasized the importance of VMT reduction in reaching those targets. The revised

11 targets call for "greater per capita GHG emission reductions from SB 375 than are
12 currently in place, which for 2035, translate into targets that either match or exceed the
13 emission reduction levels contained in the MPOs' currently adopted SCSs." "CARB staff
14 believes that to achieve the intent of the legislation and to maximize community co-
15 benefits, the per capita GHG emission reduction targets should be achieved
16 predominantly through strategies that reduce VMT." (CARB SB 375 Staff Proposal at

17

18 p. 19 (June 2017).) In fact, "CARB's recommended targets are equivalent to reducing

19 VMT a half a a mile per person per day." (Id. at p. 28.) CARB recognized that SB 375 and
other VMT reduction strategies "need to provide a 25 percent reduction in statewide per
20 capita greenhouse gas emissions relative to 2005 by 2035" to meet the statewide goals.

21 (Id. at p. 29.) For SANDAG, CARB staff has recommended a 2035 reduction target of
22 21%, which is higher than the 2035 target in SANDAG's current RTP/SCS and higher
23 than the 18% target requested by SANDAG.

24 B.

25 The County's 2011 General Plan Update

36. In 2011, the County approved an update to its General Plan ("General Plan
26 Update"). Petitioner is informed and believes that the General Plan Update took

27 approximately ten years to complete, involved substantial input from numerous
28 stakeholders and citizens groups, and cost approximately $18 million dollars in taxpayer

LATHAM&WATKINSwP 11

RELIEF

1 money.

2 37. In the EIR for its General Plan Update, the County concluded that the GHG

3 and climate change impacts from the County's operations and from community sources

4 were "potentially significant" with regard to compliance with AB 32.

5 38. The General Plan Update EIR included mitigation measures for GHG and

6 climate change impacts. As noted by the Court of Appeal in Sierra Club v. County of San
7 Diego (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 1152, 1158-59, the General Plan Update's impetus for

8 GHG mitigation included a comment letter by the California Attorney General: "There

9 was extensive public comment on the general plan update, including from the California

10 Attorney General: '[Wle encourage the County to incorporate into the General Plan

11 interim policies to ensure that any projects considered before completion of the CAP will

12 not undermine the objectives of the CAP; and ... for all GHG impacts the County has

13 designated as significant, adopt feasible mitigation measures that can be identified today

14 and that do not require further analysis.™*

15 39. In particular, MM CC-1.2 required the County to take the following action:

16 Prepare a County Climate Change Action Plan with an

17 update[d] baseline inventory of greenhouse gas emissions from all sources, more detailed greenhouse gas emissions reduction
18 targets and deadlines; and a comprehensive and enforceable GHG emissions reduction measures that will achieve a 17%

19 reduction in emissions from County operations from 2006 by 2020 and a 9% reduction in community emissions between

20 2006 and 2020. Once prepared, the plan's implementation will be monitored and progress reported on a regular basis.

21 40. The County's General Plan Update also included provisions requiring the
22 certification of a CAP and related thresholds of significance. Policy COS-20.1 required
23 preparation of a CAP. The County's General Plan Implementation Plan required
24 preparation of a CAP and related thresholds of significance. Further, General Plan Policy

25 COS-20.3 and the General Plan Implementation Plan require coordination of GHG
26 reduction measures with SANDAG and other state and regional planning entities.
27 General Plan Policy LU-4.1 and General Plan Goal LU-4 similarly require coordination

28 with other agencies and regional planning.

2 The General Plan's Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program
(*MMRP"), approved by the County along with the General Plan Update, also includes
3 provisions requiring the County to prepare a CAP (6.9.1.A), work with SANDAG to

4

5 achieve regional GHG reduction goals (6.9.1.C), reduce vehicle trips (6.9.2), and revise
its thresholds of significance based on its CAP (6.9.3.A).

6 C. The County's Legally Inadequate 2012 CAP

7 42.

8 Petitioner is informed and believes that the County undertook to prepare a

9 CAP within six months of adopting the General Plan Update. However, the CAP was not
approved until nearly a year

10 after the General Plan Update EIR was certified. As part of

11 this earlier CAP, the County prepared a Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory as a special

12 appendix (General Plan Update, Appendix K). Appendix K included projected emissions

13 reductions and assumptions and promised that the CAP would further detail the County's
GHG emissions and how those reductions will occur.

14 43. The County approved a CAP on June 20, 2012 (the "2012 CAP").
15 Petitioner is informed and believes that the 2012 CAP was intended to serve as a

16 mitigation measure to mitigate otherwise significant adverse impacts resulting from the

17 County's 2011 General Plan Update.

18 44. On July 20, 2012, the Sierra Club challenged the validity of the County's
19 adoption of the 2012 CAP in the Superior Court of San Diego County, in Case No.

20 37-2012-00101054-CU-TT-CTL.

21 45. The Superior Court entered judgment in favor of the Sierra Club on April
22 24, 2013, and required the County to set aside the 2012 CAP.

23 46.

24 On October 29, 2014, the Fourth District Court of Appeal, Division One,

3 Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines Section
15183.5.

4 F.

5 CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1 and Impacts from General Plan

Amendments

6 62. In certifying the final SEIR for the CAP Project, the County found that the
7 CAP Project's potential impact regarding GHG emissions was potentially significant,

8

9 because in-process and future applications for General Plan amendments could alter

10 emissions forecasts that were based on the underlying General Plan.

63.

11 In recognition of this potentially significant impact, the County devised

12 "CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1," in an attempt to "ensure that CAP emissions

13 forecasts are not substantially altered such that attainment of GHG reduction targets
could not be achieved."

14 64.

15 CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1 offered two pathways to mitigating
this potentially significant environmental impact for pending and future General Plan
16 amendments: the "no net increase" option; and the "net zero" option. In general, the "no
17

18 net increase" option required applicants to demonstrate that the increase in GHG
emissions for the project would be no greater than GHG emissions forecasted for the
19 project area in the 2011 General Plan Update; the "net zero" option similarly required
20 applicants to demonstrate that the increase in GHG emissions for the project would be no

21

22 greater than GHG emissions over existing baseline conditions (which is likely a slightly
more environmentally protective requirement).

23 65.

24 For either option, CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1 permitted applicants
to demonstrate "no net increase" or "net zero" through on-site and off-site project design
25 features and mitigation measures. In particular, CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1
26 incorporated an approach to achieve the "no net increase" and "net zero" requirements -

27 an applicant could purchase carbon offset credits to be used in the accounting for a
28 project's net GHG emissions: "Offsite mitigation, including purchase of carbon offset

LATHAM&WATKINS 17

ATTORNEYS AT LAW
SAN DIEGO VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY
RELIEF

-

2 credits, would be allowed after all feasible on-site design features and mitigation
measures have been incorporated."

3 66.

4 As explained by the County in the CAP Project's SEIR at page 2.7-24, "A
carbon offset project is created when a specific action is taken that reduces, avoids, or
5 sequesters GHG emissions." In short, this means that a project applicant could purchase a

6 commitment from another third party that such third party would reduce GHG emissions
7 somewhere else (i.e., not at the project site), SO that the project applicant could count this

8

9 as a reduction in the project's accounting of GHG emissions from the project itself.
67. Despite the fact that the County adopted, concurrently with the 2018 CAP,
10 amendments to the General Plan that required "the reduction of community-wide (i.e.,

11

12 unincorporated County)" GHG emissions, CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1 departed

13 from this clear directive. One of the key features of CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1

14 was the "geographic priorities" provision for GHG mitigation, which allowed "credit" for

15 GHG reductions that took place outside of the area of the unincorporated County,
including within the County but inside incorporated cities not under the land use
16 jurisdiction of the County, and throughout the state, nation, and world:

17

18 The County will consider, to the satisfaction of the Director of Planning & Development Services (PDS), the following

19 geographic priorities for GHG reduction features, and GHG reduction projects and programs: 1) project design features/on-

20 site reduction measures; 2) off-site within the unincorporated areas of the County of San Diego; 3) off-site within the County

21 of San Diego; 4) off-site within the State of California; 5) off- site within the United States; and 6) off-site internationally.

22 (Emphasis added.)

23 68.

24 Specifically with respect to the use of carbon offset credits, CAP Mitigation

25 Measure M-GHG-1 sets forth the following requirement:

26 Carbon offset credits must be purchased through any of the following: (i) a CARB-approved registry, such as the Climate

27 Action Reserve, the American Carbon Registry, and the Verified Carbon Standard, (ii) any registry approved by CARB

28 to act as a registry under the state's cap-and-trade program, (iii) through the CAPCOA GHG Rx and the SDAPCD, or (iv) if no registry is in existence as identified in options (i), (ii), or (iii),

LATHAM&WATKINSUP 18

ATTORNEYS AT LAW
SAN DIEGO VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY
RELIEF

-

2 above, then any other reputable registry or entity that issues carbon offsets consistent with Cal. Health & Saf. Code

3 section 38562(d)(1)), to the satisfaction of the Director of PDS.

4 (Emphasis added.)'

5 69. To the extent that CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1's "geographic
6 priorities for GHG reduction features" required carbon offsets to result in GHG
7 reductions within the County, this requirement is illusory. According to the SEIR, only

8

9 one project (a reforestation project) within San Diego County is included on the approved
registries for offset projects. At this time, however, credits are not available from that
10 project, because the trees have not reached maturity. (Final SEIR at p. 8-52.)

11 70. In addition, the structure and process for this new carbon offsets program is
12 deficient. For the new carbon offsets program, County staff (i.e., the Director of Planning

13 & Development Services and his or her subordinates) has the authority to make two
14 critical determinations. First, County staff determines the feasibility of both on-site and
15 off-site GHG reduction measures. Second, County staff also determines whether off-site
16 carbon credits may be used to count towards a reduction in

17 71. project's GHG emissions.

18 Furthermore, CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1 was not the County's

19 only option to address the potentially significant impact of in-process and future General
Plan amendment projects. The County could have considered and/or adopted alternative
20 approaches or measures to address these potential impacts. For example, the public

21

22 suggested an alternative or mitigation measure that would limit in-process or future

23 General Plan amendments to areas identified by SANDAG as "smart growth" areas as

24 designated by urban area transit boundaries on SANDAG's Smart Growth Concept Map.
The public also suggested an alternative or mitigation measure that CAP Mitigation
25 Measure M-GHG-1 be amended to require a specific percentage of a project's emissions

26

27

28 CAPCOA GHG Rx is the California Air Pollution Control Officer's Association's California-based Greenhouse Gas Credit Exchange. SDAPCD is San Diego Air Pollution Control District.

P reductions derive from VMT reduction or require that a General Plan amendment project

2 not increase County-wide VMT. The County did not adequately consider or analyze

3 potentially feasible alternatives or revisions to CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1 to

4 address various objections from the public.

5 72. Based on this novel approach, the County determined that, "With
6 implementation of the above mitigation measure [CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1],

7 the incremental increase in GHG emissions from in-process or future GPAs would be

8 offset such that CAP emission forecasts would not be affected. Impacts would be reduced

9 a to a less than considerable level." (Final SEIR at p. 2.7-40.)

10 G. The Golden Door's (and Public's) Attempts to Alert the County to the

11 County's Numerous Legal Errors in Approving the 2018 CAP Project

12 73. The new draft CAP, amendments to the General Plan, and SEIR underwent

13 public review in August and September 2017. Public interest in the CAP Project was
14 substantial, with over 150 written comments from government agencies, community
15 groups, organizations, and individuals before the release of the final SEIR in January
16 2018.

17 74. Other members of the public raised concerns similar and/or related to the

18 Golden Door's expressed concerns, including the Sierra Club, SANDAG, the Endangered

19 Habitats League, the Climate Action Campaign, the Cleveland National Forest
20 Foundation, the Coastal Environmental Rights Foundation, California Native Plant

21 Society, Southwest Interpretive Association, Preserve Wild Santee, Environmental

22 Center of San Diego, and STAY COOL for Grandkids. As with other members of the
23 public, the Golden Door actively participated in commenting on the proposed CAP and

24 amendments to the General Plan.

25 75. Early on in the process, on November 21, 2016, the Golden Door submitted

26 a comment letter on the CAP SEIR's Notice of Preparation. In particular, the Golden

27 Door cautioned the County on adopting provisions in the CAP that would allow "for
28 unlimited thresholds to accommodate all possible General Plan amendments," which
20
LATHAM&WATKINS wP VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
ATTORNEYS AT LAW COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY
RELIEF SAN DIEGO

1 "would render the County unable to meet its required targets."

2 76. On September 25, 2017, the Golden Door submitted a written comment to

3 the County on the proposed CAP and General Plan amendments. Among other things, the

4 Golden Door pointed out to the County that the proposed CAP should prioritize GHG
5 reductions within the County, ensure an enforceable mechanism or process for the use of
6 carbon offsets as part of the proposed CAP's GHG reduction measures, and ensure the

7 appropriate implementation of VMT reduction as part of the proposed CAP.

8 77. On December 1, 2017, the Golden Door submitted a written comment in
9 response to the County Planning Commission's October 20, 2017 informational meeting
10 regarding the proposed CAP. Among other things, the Golden Door expressed concerns

11 over the County's post-draft SEIR technical analysis of potential GHG reduction
12 measures to be implemented as part of the proposed CAP, as well as the apparent "menu"
13 approach of GHG reduction strategies, instability of the project description, and the

14 addition or deletion of mitigation measures.

15 78. On January 16, 2018, the Golden Door submitted two written comments to
16 the County expressing its concern that the proposed CAP did not require GHG reductions
17 to occur within the County as required by the General Plan, but instead permitted future
18 applicants for General Plan Amendment projects to "offset" an unlimited proportion of a
19 project's GHG emissions by purchasing GHG "credits" from foreign entity. The
20 Golden Door also alerted the County to potential CEQA violations in how it structured
21 the findings for feasibility for its new program for carbon offsets, in its failure to
22 adequately analyze VMT and smart-growth locations as part of the proposed CAP,
23 potential mitigation measures or alternatives to be included as part of the proposed CAP,

24 and CEQA requirements for definite and enforceable mitigation.

25 79. On February 13, 2018, the Golden Door submitted a written comment to
26 the County Board of Supervisors, alerting the County to, among other things:

27 Its failure to properly evaluate the proposed CAP's carbon offset
28 program under CEQA;
21
LATHAM&WATKINSwP
ATTORNEYS AT LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND

SAN DIEGO COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY
RELIEF

F Its failure to properly evaluate the proposed CAP's analysis of VMT
2 consistent with state and regional planning policies and guidance;

3 Its failure to properly evaluate potential additional mitigation

4 measures or alternatives as part of the proposed CAP;
4n o Its failure to coordinate with state and regional agencies as required
by its General Plan;

7 Its failure to analyze the proposed CAP's impacts on energy as

8 required by CEQA, the proposed CAP's inconsistency with the General Plan (even

9 as amended);

10 Its failure to adhere to CEQA requirements for feasible, definite, and

11 enforceable mitigation;

12 Its failure to provide legally adequate responses to public comments;

13 and

14 Its failure to adequately consider the environmental justice

15 implications of the County's refusal to adequately consider the reduction of VMT

16 and associated health, air quality, and quality of life benefits on economically

17 disadvantaged communities.
18 Notably, the Golden Door's February 13, 2018 comment letter contained specific and
19 detailed suggested revisions to the County's CAP approval documents, including to CAP
20 Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1 and the amendments to General Plan Goal COS-20 and

21 Policy COS-20.1, to correct the legal deficiencies that the Golden Door had identified.

22 80. The County ignored these suggestions and on February 14, 2018, approved

23 the CAP Project with the identified errors uncorrected. The County issued a Notice of
24 Determination under CEQA that day.

25 H. Need for Relief

26 81. Based on the County's dismissal of the Golden Door's concerns (as well as
27 the concerns of numerous other members of the public) and the County's intent to use the

28 2018 CAP for all development proposals on unincorporated County lands, and in order to
22
LATHAM&WATKINSwP
ATTORNEYS AT LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND

RELIEF

- preserve Petitioner's rights to challenge 2018 CAP with respect to specific development
2 proposals on unincorporated County lands, Petitioner brings this action for writ of

3 mandate and injunctive and declaratory relief.

4 82. Petitioner has a beneficial a right and interest in fulfillment of the County's
5 duties pursuant to its General Plan, CEQA, and PZL in relation to the proper evaluation

6

7 of GHG impacts from development proposals on unincorporated County lands.

83.

8 Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law. On information

9 and belief, the County intends to process development proposals on unincorporated

10 County lands pursuant to the improper 2018 CAP and CAP Mitigation Measure M-

11 GHG-1. As part of its approval of the 2018 CAP Project, the County also adopted a new

12 CEQA significance threshold for evaluation of climate change impacts. These new

13 guidelines state, "County staff will use these Guidelines as part of the environmental

14 review process to evaluate GHG emissions for individual discretionary projects." The
new significance threshold states simply that "A proposed project would have a less than
15 significant cumulatively considerable contribution to climate change impacts if it is found

16 to be consistent with the County's Climate Action Plan; and, would normally have a
17 cumulatively considerable contribution to climate change impacts if it is found to be
18 inconsistent with the County's Climate Action Plan." Because this threshold is based on
19 consistency with the CAP, provisions of the CAP will be assumed to be legally valid
20 when applied to analysis of future projects' impacts.

21 84. If Petitioner is not permitted to challenge the 2018 CAP Project, it would
22 prejudice subsequent challenges to specific development proposals on unincorporated

23

24 County lands, a such as a challenge to the Newland Sierra project.

85. CEQA favors review of potential environmental impacts as early as is
25 feasible in the project approval process so that it can influence project design. (See Cal.
26 Code Regs., title 14, § 15004 [Cal. Code Regs., title 14, sections 15000 et seq. are
27 commonly known as the "CEQA Guidelines"].) To assure legally adequate analysis of
28 potential GHG impacts from development proposals on unincorporated County lands, the

2 County must conduct its analysis under an appropriate legal framework in time to allow

3 for project design and project alternatives to adequately address such potential impacts.

4 Accordingly, Petitioner challenges actions 1.2.1 through 1.2.6 as described in Exhibit 1,
County Minute Order No. 1 for the February 14, 2018 meeting of the Board of
5 Supervisors, through the following causes of action.

9 Failure to Comply With Adopted Mitigation Measures

10 (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1060, 1085, 1094.5; Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168, 21168.5, 21081.6)

86.

11 Petitioner incorporates by reference the allegations contained in all
preceding paragraphs.

12 87.

13 An actual and justiciable controversy has arisen and now exists between

14 Petitioner and the County concerning whether CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1

15 complies with General Plan Update EIR MM CC-1.2 and General Plan goals and policies
that require the County to achieve "the reduction of community-wide (i.e.,
16 unincorporated County)" GHG emissions. CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1 allows in-
17 process and future development proposals to take credit for GHG reduction that occurs

18

19 outside of San Diego County in exchange for an increase in GHG emissions within the
County.

20 88.

21 Mitigation measures, including General Plan Update Mitigation Measure

22 CC-1.2, must be enforceable. (Pub. Res. Code § 21081.6(b).) By incorporating an out-of-
County carbon offset credit program as part of the CAP, the County is unable to
23 implement Mitigation Measure CC-1.2.

24 89. "Where a public agency has failed to comply with CEQA ... [and] if the
25 court finds that a specific project activity will prejudice the consideration and
26 implementation of mitigation measures

27 and could result in an adverse physical
change" the Court must "mandate that the agency and any real party in interest suspend
28 specific activity until the agency complies with CEQA." (Lincoln Place Tenants Assn. v.

1 City of Los Angeles (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 425, 453. [emphasis added])

2 90. The Superior Court in 2012 and the Court of Appeal in 2014 already found

3 in Sierra Club that the County was in violation of CEQA when each court determined

4 that the 2012 CAP failed to adequately mitigate climate change impacts. The County
5 cannot use out-of-County carbon offset credits, rather than on-site or community-level

6 GHG emissions reductions, to discount the significance of GHG emissions impacts of
7 development proposals on unincorporated County lands, without further analysis of

8 enforceability and effectiveness. Because the 2018 CAP and its related threshold of
9 significance constitute a comprehensive approach to GHG mitigation, the County's
10 performance of CEQA review for development proposals on unincorporated County

11 lands pursuant to the 2018 CAP prejudices the consideration and implementation of MM
12 CC-1.2. Other alternatives were proposed in public comments that were similarly

13 ignored.

14 91. The County ignored specific recommendations provided by the Golden

15 Door to correct this defect in its analysis. The Golden Door provided specific
16 recommendations to the County to ensure that an in-process or future General Plan

17 amendment project would not entirely rely on offsets outside of the County rather than
18 reducing GHG emissions on site. (See Golden Door Comment 014-12.) Rather than
19 analyzing these potential recommendations, the County simply stated that the Golden
20 Door provided no evidence that these alternative approaches would be successful. (See

21 County Response to Comments 014-12.)

22 92. Public interest in resolving the controversy is substantial. The public has a
23 significant interest in ensuring that climate change effects are adequately mitigated.

24 Instead, the County is ignoring the requirement to evaluate the GHG impacts of
25 development proposals on unincorporated County lands pursuant to a legally valid CAP
26 and related threshold of significance.

27 93. Judicial relief is in the interest of judicial economy, in order to avoid the
28 potential for multiplicity of suits and momentum of the County's application of the

All such decisions are to be guided by an effective planning process that includes the 27

2 M-GHG-1, by contrast, permits the County to obtain a "paper reduction" of GHG

3

4 emissions within the County through the purchase of credits for ostensible GHG

5 reductions in other parts of California, the United States, or the world.
103.

6 Other provisions of the General Plan support the requirement that GHG

7 emissions reductions be obtained within the unincorporated County. The County failed to

8 analyze the impacts of M-GHG-1's inconsistency with these provisions as well.

9 104. General Plan Guiding Principle No. 7 states: Maintain environmentally

10 sustainable communities and reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to
climate change. ... The County of San Diego can move towards sustainability and a
11 reduction of GHG emissions by managing land development and building construction,
12 conserving habitats and natural resources, providing efficient transportation and mobility
13

14 systems, and developing its infrastructure and public services. As described for Guiding

15 Principle 2, land should be developed more compactly, resulting in reduced automobile
use and increased use of public transit, walking, and bicycling. This will result in less
16 consumption of gasoline, generation of less air pollution and GHG emissions, the

17

18 preservation of greater amounts of habitat and agricultural lands, and the improvement of

19 the lifestyles and health of community residents." (Id. at 2-13 [emphasis in original].)

105.

20 The General Plan's Conservation and Open Space Element's Guiding

21 Principles state: "Energy production, transportation, and consumption are key

22 contributors to greenhouse gases affecting climate change, poor local air quality, and a
variety of other sustainability challenges. The Conservation and Open Space Element
23 encourages and supports land use development patterns and transportation choices
24 that reduce pollutants and greenhouse gases. In addition, the Element encourages
25 renewable energy production, along with efficient energy use in buildings and
26 infrastructure and minimizes the impacts of projects that can generate air pollutants."

27 (County General Plan at p. 5-3 [emphasis added].)

LATHAM&WATKINS UP 28

ATTORNEYS AT LAW

- relating to Air Quality, Climate Change, and Energy states: "The development of
2 sustainable communities contributes to both the reduction in overall air pollutants as

3

4 well as solving the larger challenges associated with GCC. A holistic approach to
achieving sustainable communities requires the integration of a regionwide multi-modal
5 transportation system with a significant reduction in the reliance on single-occupant
6 motor vehicles, along with buildings that consume less through design and efficient
7 building materials." (Id. at p. 5-31 [emphasis added].)

8 107.

9 General Plan Policy COS-14.1 states: "Land Use Development Form.
Require that development be located and designed to reduce vehicular trips (and
10 associated air pollution) by utilizing compact regional and community-level development

11

12 patterns while maintaining community character." The County has previously explained

13 to the State Attorney General that General Plan Policy COS-14.1 "requires that
development be located and designated to reduce vehicular trips by utilizing compact
14 regional and community-level development patterns while maintaining community
15 character." (Response to Comment S1-28 [2011 General Plan Update EIR].)

16 108. General Plan Policy COS-2.2 states: "Habitat Protection through Site
17 Design. Require development to be sited in the least biologically sensitive areas and

18 minimize the loss of natural habitat through site design. (Conservation and Open Space
19 Element.)

20 109.

21 General Plan Policy S-1.1 states: "Minimize Exposure to Hazards.
Minimize the population exposed to hazards by assigning land use designations and
22 density allowances that reflect site specific constraints and hazards." (Safety Element.)
23 110.

24 General Plan Goal LU-5 states: "Climate Change and Land Use. A land

25 use plan and associated development techniques and patterns that reduce emissions of

26 local greenhouse gases in accordance with state initiatives, while promoting public
health." (Id. at 3-27 [emphasis in original].)

27 111. The County has plenary land use authority for unincorporated lands and
28 may constrain land use decisions - even if the document doing so is not labeled a "land

P use plan" - and could do so as part of the CAP.

2 112. Although the County's General Plan requires the County to exercise its

3 land use jurisdiction to site projects in areas that will reduce VMT, protect biologically

4 sensitive areas and natural habitat, and protect existing residents from increased risk of
5 environmental and other hazards, CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1 has no

6 requirements for alternative or constrained project siting or VMT-reduction.

7 113. Similarly, the General Plan contains multiple policies that mandate

8 coordination of regional planning and explicitly requires coordination with SANDAG

9 and to ensure that local planning adheres to SB 375's principles.

10 114. General Plan Goal LU-4 states, "Inter-jurisdictional Coordination.

11 Coordination with the plans and activities of other agencies and tribal governments that

12 relate to issues such as land use, community character, transportation, energy, other
13 infrastructure, public safety, and resource conservation and management in the
14 unincorporated County and the region."

15 115. General Plan Policy LU-4.1 states, "Regional Planning. Participate in
16 regional planning to ensure that the unique communities, assets, and challenges of the
17 unincorporated lands are appropriately addressed with the implementation of the planning
18 principles and land use requirements, including the provisions of SB375."

19 116. General Plan Policy COS-20.3 states, "Regional Collaboration. Coordinate

20 air quality planning efforts with federal and State agencies, SANDAG, and other
21 jurisdictions."

22 117. However, the County has not sought input from SANDAG about the impact

23 of CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1 on SANDAG's VMT-reduction policies or ability

24 to meet existing and proposed SB 375 targets. The County has not modeled potential

25 VMT increases to determine the impact of CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1 on
26 SANDAG's RTP/SCS.

27 118. The County also has not sought guidance from CARB, the State's expert
28 agency on air quality and GHG emissions. Moreover, the CAP's offset scheme for

2 General Plan Amendment projects via Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1 contradicts
CARB's 2017 Scoping Plan Update's guidance to prioritize VMT reduction, ensure co-
3 benefits from carbon offset purchases are realized locally, and emphasize environmental
4 justice in GHG emissions reduction actions.

5 119. Public interest in resolving the controversy is substantial. The public has a
6 significant interest in ensuring the County's compliance with its General Plan and

7

8 CEQA's informational mandates, in particular with General Plan requirements to

9 consider project siting alternatives and to coordinate with other relevant agencies
regarding local and regional planning.

11 120. Judicial relief is essential to obtain the County's compliance with CEQA's
statutory mandate for EIRs to serve as adequate informational documents for both the

2 124. The Court in Madera Oversight Coalition, Inc. V. County of Madera (2011)

3 199 Cal.App.4th 48, 105, explained that "omitting or ignoring contrary information is not

4 the way to produce an adequate informational document."

5 125. And as the Supreme Court emphasized last year in Banning Ranch

6 Conservancy V. City of Newport Beach (2017) 2 Cal.5th 918, 942, public agencies must
7 provide relevant information about "related regulations" of other agencies and their
8 impacts on a proposed project, rather than ignore those agencies and their regulations.

9 126. The Supreme Court stated in Banning Ranch Conservancy:

10 To be prejudicial, a failure to account for related regulations must substantially impair the EIR's informational function. 11 Here, the City's failure to discuss ESHA requirements and impacts was neither insubstantial nor merely technical. The 12 omission resulted in inadequate evaluation of project alternatives and mitigation measures. 13

14 (2 Cal.5th, supra, at 942.)

15 127. The 2018 CAP SEIR fails to adequately analyze consistency with VMT
16 reduction targets in SB 375.

17 128. SANDAG's RTP/SCS model for the unincorporated County is based on

18 land use inputs from the County's approved 2011 General Plan Update. The land use
19 designations in the 2011 General Plan Update are the product of over a decade of
20 | community input and stakeholder negotiations and are generally considered to adhere to
21 smart-growth principles of locating new density near existing infrastructure and transit.

22 Any amendment to the County's 2011 General Plan Update would necessarily alter the

23 VMT modeling performed by SANDAG to determine its VMT reductions in the current

24 RTP/SCS. This is because General Plan amendments proposed on unincorporated County
25 lands typically require densification of rural lands farther from existing infrastructure and
26 transit than the 2011 General Plan Update's planned density. In other words, General
27 Plan amendments proposed in the unincorporated County, by their nature, add long
28 vehicle trips over and above those considered in the RTP/SCS model, which relied on the
32

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND LATHAM&WATKINS P
ATTORNEYS AT LAW COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY
RELIEF SAN DIEGO

-

2 2011 General Plan Update's land use designations. (See, e.g., County of San Diego
Supplement to the 2011 GPU PEIR, at p. 8-29 (Jan. 2018) ["[T]he nature of the
3 unincorporated county is low-density development that is not conducive to non-driving

4 trips. Trip distances are longer in the unincorporated county because of this low-density
5 nature and intervening distance between land uses."].)

6 129.

7 For example, the Newland Sierra project is currently under review by the

8 County. It includes a proposed General Plan amendment that would facilitate the addition

9 of over 2,100 homes to an area zoned by the General Plan for only 99 homes. The
Newland project is proposed to be located between Escondido and the Riverside County
10 boundary more than six miles from the nearest transit center.

11

12 130. SANDAG has analyzed the impact of aggressive land use policies for

13 increased densification and determined that these policies would have minimal benefit
for GHG emissions reduction efforts. Neither SANDAG nor the County, however, has
14 analyzed the impacts of a decreased densification development pattern on unincorporated

15

16 County lands and how such sprawl planning would inhibit VMT-reduction efforts.

131.

17 Further, SANDAG submitted a comment letter to the County regarding the

18 CAP and specifically requested that the CAP consider smart-growth policies. In response
to this comment, the County indicated that its CAP adheres to smart-growth principles
19 because it is consistent with the existing General Plan. The County's response, however,
20 ignored that the CAP's mitigation plan for General Plan amendments would allow for

21

22 new sprawl projects to contradict the underlying smart-growth principles in the General

Plan.

23

24 132. Because these General Plan amendment projects would necessarily alter the
underlying inputs for SANDAG's previous VMT analysis and because no VMT
25 reduction is required by the CAP for General Plan amendment projects, the 2018 CAP

26 SEIR, in order to be an adequate informational document, should have included an
27 analysis of VMT according to a separate model and evaluated the addition of the land use
28 densities for the General Plan amendments currently in process with the County and any

LATHAM&WATKINS P 33

ATTORNEYS AT LAW
SAN DIEGO VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY
RELIEF

P other relevant scenarios. However, the 2018 CAP SEIR failed to include this analysis.

2 133. Likewise, the County's failure to analyze how its expected new projects

3 (which are allowed to move forward with GHG offsets alone under CAP Mitigation

4 Measure M-GHG-1) could increase VMT and interfere with the "related regulations" of
5 SANDAG's attainment of VMT reductions required by CARB's goals constituted a

6 prejudicial informational error. If the County had obtained the proper information about

7 the impact of these projects on SANDAG's efforts to reduce VMT, the County could

8 have considered mitigation measures and alternatives in its CAP which would support

9 SANDAG's efforts, rather than thwart them. Instead, with this VMT information

10 missing, no such mitigation measures or alternatives were considered. Indeed, no analysis

11 was conducted to determine the extent that increased VMT resulting from the
12 contemplated new projects would increase associated GHG emissions inevitably resulting
13 from increased VMT.

14 134. Rather than addressing any VMT reduction goals or requirements or
15 demonstrating their consistency with SANDAG's existing adopted VMT reduction
16 strategy, the 2018 CAP SEIR relies on CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1. CAP
17 Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1 does not consider project siting or VMT reduction

18 strategies as mitigation for in-process or future General Plan amendment projects.
19 Instead, CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1 allows General Plan amendment projects to
20 meet their GHG mitigation requirement by merely purchasing commitments (i.e., carbon

21 offset credits) to decrease GHG emissions from anywhere in the world.

22 135. In other words, CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1 would pre-approve a

23 GHG mitigation program for sprawl projects that relies on purchasing carbon offset

24 credits while ignoring local VMT reduction and consistency with SANDAG's VMT-
25 reduction plans.

26 136. As part of the 2018 CAP Project approvals, the County approved a new
27 GHG threshold guidance document, which states at page 2: "The County's CAP is also
28 intended to be used for future project-specific GHG emissions analyses by being prepared
34

P consistent with the tiering and streamlining provisions of Section 15183.5 of the CEQA

2 Guidelines. The Supplemental Environmental Impact Report (SEIR) for the CAP
3 provides the appropriate level of environmental review to allow future projects to tier

4 from and streamline their analysis of GHG emissions pursuant to CEQA Guidelines
5 Section 15183.5(b)(2)."

6 137. The County's new significance threshold is simply "consistency" with the

7 new CAP: "A proposed project would have a less than significant cumulatively

8 considerable contribution to climate change impacts if it is found to be consistent with the

9 County's Climate Action Plan; and, would normally have a cumulatively considerable a

10 contribution to climate change impacts if it is found to be inconsistent with the County's

11 Climate Action Plan."

12 138. The County's new GHG threshold guidance at pages 3-5 then describes a
13 process for evaluating impacts for future General Plan amendment projects that is

14 essentially the same as CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1.

15 139. Because the County's new GHG threshold guidance for determining
16 significance states that tiered or streamlined review is available and incorporates CAP

17 Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1 as the process for GHG mitigation for future General Plan
18 amendment projects process as the route for GPAs, and because the County's new
19 significance threshold is simply "consistency" with the CAP, in-process and future
20 General Plan amendment projects may now rely on purchasing carbon offset credits
21 while ignoring local VMT reduction and consistency with SANDAG's VMT-reduction
22 plans.

23 140. The County has not analyzed the impacts of this approach on County-wide

24 VMT or on SANDAG's ability to meet its SB 375 requirements.

25 141. Public interest in resolving the controversy is substantial. The public has a
26 significant interest in ensuring that CEQA's informational purposes are fulfilled, in
27 particular with regarding the County's decisions regarding VMT reduction or the effect

15 An actual and justiciable controversy has arisen and now exists between
Petitioner and the County concerning whether the County has violated the Planning and
16 Zoning Law, Government Code sections 65300 et seq., in adopting the 2018 CAP, which

17

18 is inconsistent with multiple General Plan goals and policies as described herein.

145. In approving the 2018 CAP Project, the County found significant and
19 unavoidable adverse environmental impacts in nearly 30 respects, including with regard
20 to conformance to federal and state air quality standards, non-attainment criteria

21

22 pollutants, air quality effects to sensitive receptors, odors, candidate, sensitive, or special-

26 146. Under Public Resources Code section 21081 and CEQA Guidelines section

27 environmental impacts if, among other things, it adopts certain findings.

28 147. The County made the following finding in support of its approval of the

LATHAM&WATKINSWP 36

ATTORNEYS AT LAW
SAN DIEGO VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY
RELIEF

1 2018 CAP Project, pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15091:

2 [TJhe County of San Diego Board of Supervisors finds that, for

3 each of the following significant effects identified in the Final SEIR, specific economic, legal, social, technological, or other

4 considerations, make infeasible the mitigation measures or alternatives identified in the SEIR.

5 148. The Supreme Court explained in City of Marina v. Board of Trustees of

6 California State Univ. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 341, 368, "A statement of overriding
7 considerations is required, and offers a proper basis for approving a project despite the

8 existence of unmitigated environmental effects, only when the measures necessary to

9 mitigate or avoid those effects have properly been found to be infeasible." (See also
10 County of San Diego v. Grossmont-Cuyamaca Community College (2006) 141
11 Cal.App.4th 86, 107-108.)

12 149. Further, in order to be adequate, an EIR must provide a good-faith and a
13 reasoned response to rejecting suggestions for mitigation or alternatives for a project.

14 (E.g., Los Angeles Unified School Dist. v. City of Los Angeles (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th

15 1019, 1029 l"In keeping with the statute and guidelines, an adequate EIR must respond to
16 specific suggestions for mitigating a significant environmental impact unless the
17 suggested mitigation is facially infeasible."]; Masonite Corp. v. County of Mendocino

18 (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 230, 241.)

19 150. The fact that a planning document may be under the jurisdiction of another

20 agency does not release the CEQA lead agency from its duty to analyze a project's

21 environmental impacts that may affect a different jurisdiction. (See, e.g., Banning Ranch
22 Conservancy, supra, 2 Cal.5th at 937 ["To the fullest extent possible, the lead agency

23 should integrate CEQA review with these related environmental review and consultation
24 requirements.].)

25 151. In the administrative proceedings regarding the 2018 CAP Project, the
26 Golden Door suggested an alternative or mitigation measure that would limit in-process

27 or future General Plan amendments to areas identified by SANDAG as "smart growth"
28 areas as designated by urban area transit boundaries on SANDAG's Smart Growth

- Concept Map. Similarly, in its comment letter on the draft CAP, SANDAG included a
2 comment encouraging the CAP to embrace smart growth policies. Other members of the

3

4 public offered alternatives and encouraged the County to consider project siting in its

5 efforts to reduce GHG emissions. The County, however, ignored these pleas.

152. The Golden Door also suggested potential changes to the County's CAP
6 Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1 to address these VMT issues. For example, the Golden

7

8 Door suggested that CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1 could be amended to require a

9 specific percentage of a project's emissions reductions derive from VMT reduction
require a that a General Plan amendment project not increase County-wide VMT. or

10

11 153. Even though the final SEIR conceded that "the nature of the unincorporated

12 county is low-density development that is not conducive to non-driving trips" and that

13 "[t]rip distances are longer in the unincorporated county," the County responded to this

14 issue by stating simply that the CAP is consistent with SANDAG's RTP/SCS because the

15 CAP does not propose land use changes to the 2011 General Plan. (Final SEIR at pp. 8-
15, 8-29, and Response to Comment L4-3.) The County also responded with an
16 inaccurate claim that CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1 "would ensure" that General

17

18 Plan Amendment projects are consistent with the RTP/SCS.
154. However, the County's analysis does not disclose or discuss the impact of
19 the County's new GHG offset policies contained in the CAP on VMT or on SANDAG's
20 smart growth policies or the impact on GHG emissions associated with increased VMT

21

22 from allowing growth in the County's rural areas. Further, CAP Mitigation Measure M-

23 GHG-1 does not include any requirement for measuring or monitoring the impacts of

24 General Plan amendments on VMT, nor does it provide for any policy to encourage VMT

25 reduction, even though the Final SEIR concedes that adherence to approved land uses in

26 the 2011 General Plan is necessary for consistency with the RTP/SCS.

155. The CAP indicates that proposed GHG emissions reductions from the
27 transportation sector are disproportionately low compared to emissions generated by on-

28 road transportation because the County lacks authority to regulate transportation. The

LATHAM&WATKINS wP 38

ATTORNEYS AT LAW

- County, however, has plenary authority over land use and could achieve greater
2 emissions reductions from on-road transportation by committing to only allowing
3 increased density from General Plan amendments in smart growth areas that will not
4 increase VMT. To the contrary, many of the currently in-process General Plan
5 amendment projects, such as the Newland Sierra project, add density to rural lands and
6 thereby create sprawl and increase the County's VMTs.

7 156.

8 As expressed by the Golden Door and other members of the public,

9 consideration of project siting to reduce GHG emissions is a feasible measure the County

10 could have included in the CAP. The County, however, ignored any potential mitigation

11 or alternatives involving project siting by stating in response to comments and at public

12 meetings that "the CAP is not a land use plan." This conclusory and dismissive response

13 ignores that the County has plenary authority for land use decisions on unincorporated
County lands. The Golden Door further described how the County has previously
14 incorporated land use policy criteria in documents such as the General Plan's Safety
15 Element and Conservation and Open Space Element even though such documents are not
16

17 per se "land use plans." The County's obstinate refusal to even consider project siting

18 ignored feasible mitigation and alternatives based on a conclusory recitation of its mantra

19 that the CAP is "not a land use plan" and without the legally required consideration and
analysis.

20

21 157. Accordingly, the County's analysis of this issue as demonstrated by its

22 responses to public comment fails to comply with CEQA.

158. Public interest in resolving the controversy is substantial. The public has a
23 significant interest in ensuring that CEQA's mandates are adhered to, in particular with
24 the requirement that the County analyze all feasible mitigation measures or alternatives
25 prior to approving a project that has significant and unavoidable environmental impacts.
26 159. Judicial relief is essential to obtain the County's compliance with CEQA's
27 statutory mandate for EIRs to serve as adequate informational documents for both the
28 decisionmakers and the public. The 2018 CAP SEIR did not constitute an adequate

5 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

6 VIOLATION OF CEQA

7 Improper Delegation of Feasibility Findings to Director of Planning;

8 Improper Process for Delaying Feasibility Findings to After Project Approval

10 Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168, 21168.5, 21002, 21003, 21081)

11 160. Petitioner incorporates by reference the allegations contained in all
12 preceding paragraphs.

13 161. An actual and justiciable controversy has arisen and now exists between

14 Petitioner and the County concerning whether the County may delegate findings of
15 feasibility for on-site and off-site mitigation measures to the Director of Planning and
16 Development Services.

17 162. CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1 delegates to the Director of Planning

18 and Development Services two key determinations regarding potential mitigation
19 measures for in-process and future General Plan amendment projects.

20 163. First, CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1 delegates to the Director of

21 Planning and Development Services the determination of "geographic priorities for GHG
22 reduction features, and GHG reduction projects and programs: 1) project design
23 features/on-site reduction measures; 2) off-site within the unincorporated areas of the

24 County of San Diego; 3) off-site within the County of San Diego; 4) off-site within the

25 State of California; 5) off-site within the United States; and 6) off-site internationally." In

26 other words, CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1 provides that the Director of Planning

27 and Development Services will determine whether on-site GHG reduction measures are

28 feasible and whether off-site measures, including the purchase of state-, national-, or
40
LATHAMWATKINS wP

P global-carbon credit offsets, will be permitted.

2 164. Second, CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1 delegates to the Director of

3 Planning and Development Services the determination of when non-standard carbon

4 offset credits may be applied to a project: "Carbon offset credits must be purchased
5 through any of the following: (i) a CARB-approved registry, such as the Climate Action
6 Reserve, the American Carbon Registry, and the Verified Carbon Standard, (ii) any
7 registry approved by CARB to act as a registry under the state's cap-and-trade program,

8 (iii) through the CAPCOA GHG Rx and the SDAPCD, or (iv) if no registry is in

9 existence as identified in options (i), (ii), or (iii), above, then any other reputable registry

10 or entity that issues carbon offsets consistent with Cal. Health & Saf. Code section

11 38562(d)(1)), to the satisfaction of the Director of PDS." In other words, if there is no
12 registry approved by CARB, CAPCOA GHG Rx and SDAPCD, then an applicant could
13 purchase any offset credit provided that the registry that issues the credit is "reputable"

14 and "consistent with" Health and Safety Code section 38562(d)(1). CAP Mitigation
15 Measure M-GHG-1 does not contain any further explanation or sufficiently definite
16 performance standards for what constitutes a "reputable" registry or what "consistent

17 with" Health and Safety Code section 38562(d)(1) precisely means.

18 165. As additional evidence, at the Planning Commission hearing on the 2018

19 CAP Project on January 18, 2018, County Counsel stated that feasibility determinations
20 would be made consistent with CEQA's standard for feasibility. CEQA's standard for

21 feasibility is set forth in Public Resources Code sections 21081 and 21081.5. Under

22 CEQA, feasibility determinations are permitted to be made only by the decisionmaker for

23 the action.

24 166. Consistent with the text of CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1, County
25 staff has described a process whereby County staff members would determine feasibility

26 of potential mitigation measures in the context of project-specific approvals and without
27 public input and review. The County's response to written comments made to the
28 Planning Commission reiterates that feasibility findings will not be made by the Board in
41

- a public proceeding pursuant to CEQA's requirements. (See, e.g., Response to Comment
2 X27-3 ["Only when it is determined to the satisfaction of the Director of PDS that no

3

4 other feasible onsite or in-county GHG reductions could be achieved, then projects would

5 be allowed to pursue out-of-County offsets."]; see also County of San Diego, Mitigation

9 applicant/consultant to ensure consistency with Report Format and Guidelines and ensure

10 that all feasible on-site design features and mitigation measures have been incorporated;

11 the Director of PDS shall determine the geographic priorities of off-site carbon offset

12 credits; offset credits shall be purchased prior to construction and operation of subsequent
project."].)

13 167. In addition, the Director of Planning explained at the January 18, 2018
14 meeting of the Planning Commission that feasibility determinations may even be made

15 after project approval: "We're generally going to follow the CEQA requirements about
16 determining the feasibility of any mitigation measure. And it would be a director's

17

18 determination based on the conditions of approval associated with the project." (See also

19 County of San Diego, Mitigation and Monitoring Reporting Program for the Supplement
to the 2011 General Plan Update Program Environmental Impact Report (Jan. 2018), at
20 p. 6 ["the Director of PDS shall determine the geographic priorities of off-site carbon

21 offset credits; offset credits shall be purchased prior to construction and operation of
22 subsequent project."].) However, CEQA does not permit an agency to make post-hoc

23

24 determination regarding feasibility determinations after a project has been approved.

168. In its February 13, 2018 letter, the Golden Door provided specific and
25 detailed suggested revisions to the County's CAP approval documents to address this
26 issue. The County did not incorporate or meaningfully address these suggestions in its

27 final approvals for the 2018 CAP Project.

28 169. Public interest in resolving the controversy is substantial. The public has a

F significant interest in ensuring the County's compliance with its CEQA's informational

2 mandates, in particular with CEQA requirements that feasibility of mitigation measures

3 be determined by the decisionmaker for the lead agency, rather than being delegated to

4 staff and CEQA requirements that feasibility of mitigation measures be determined prior

5 to project approval, not after.

6 170. Judicial relief is essential to obtain the County's compliance with CEQA's
7 statutory mandate for EIRs to serve as adequate informational documents for both the

8 decisionmakers and the public. The County did not proceed in a manner required by law

10 or when it approved a process by which feasibility determinations would be made after

11 project approval.

15 CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1

16 (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1060, 1085, 1094.5; Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168, 21168.5, 21061)

17 171. Petitioner incorporates by reference the allegations contained in all
18 preceding paragraphs.

19 172. An actual and justiciable controversy has arisen and now exists between
20 Petitioner and the County concerning whether the 2018 CAP, including CAP Mitigation

21 Measure M-GHG-1, constitutes feasible and enforceable mitigation that is adequately
22 discussed and analyzed under the requirements of CEQA.

23 173. CEQA requires mitigation measures to be feasible, enforceable, and

24 adequately disclosed and discussed within an EIR so that the public and decisionmakers

25 may make an informed judgment as to the enforceability of such measures. (14 Cal. Code
26 Regs. § 15126.4(a)(1)(2); see also Sierra Club v. County of Fresno (2014) 226
27 Cal.App.4th 704, 750-51.)

28 174. The County committed prejudicial error under CEQA in several respects
43

RELIEF SAN DIEGO

1 regarding its analysis of the feasibility and enforceability of GHG mitigation measures.

2 175. Second, the County has failed to demonstrate that CAP Mitigation Measure
3 M-GHG-1's program for GHG offset projects will be enforceable. The County has not

4 demonstrated that it has any right or authority to enforce or oversee such projects,
5 including any agreement with the entity producing the offset credits. The County has

6 similarly failed to demonstrate or clarify what regulatory agency will oversee or enforce
7 the registries listed in the CAP.

8 176. Finally, the County has failed to demonstrate that CAP Mitigation Measure

9 M-GHG-1's program for GHG offset projects will succeed as mitigation. CAP Mitigation
10 Measure M-GHG-1 does not account for all of the cumulative GHG emissions from in-

11 process and future General Plan amendment projects. CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-

12 requires mitigation for emissions from construction and from operations (see Final

13 SEIR at pp. 2.7-39, 2.7-40), but does not include other emissions associated with such

14 projects, such as emissions from induced traffic caused by off-site road improvements or
15 other activities. By failing to mitigate for these impacts, CAP Mitigation Measure M-
16 GHG-1 is necessarily incomplete.

17 177. Public interest in resolving the controversy is substantial. The public has a
18 significant interest in ensuring the County's compliance with its CEQA's informational
19 mandates, in particular with CEQA requirements to disclose and analyze the feasibility

20 and enforceability of mitigation measures.

21 178. Judicial relief is essential to obtain the County's compliance with CEQA's
22 statutory mandate for EIRs to serve as adequate informational documents for both the

23 decisionmakers and the public. The County did not proceed in a manner required by law a

Failure to Analyze CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1 as a CEQA project

5 Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168, 21168.5, 21061, 21065)

6 179. Petitioner incorporates by reference the allegations contained in all
7 preceding paragraphs.

8 180. An actual and justiciable controversy has arisen and now exists between

9 Petitioner and the County concerning whether the County failed to comply with CEQA

10 by not evaluating the carbon offset program contained as part of CAP Mitigation

11 Measure M-GHG-1 as a separate "project" under CEQA that required a separate EIR.

12 181. As alleged herein, CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1 allows for the
13 purchase of carbon offset credits in order to mitigate the GHG emissions impacts from all

14 subsequently approved General Plan Amendment projects.

15 182. In Sierra Club v. County of San Diego (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 1152, 1170-
16 71, the Court of Appeal explained, "the County made an erroneous assumption that the

17 CAP and Thresholds project was the same project as the general plan update." "As a

18 result, the County failed to render a 'written determination of environmental impact'
19 before approving the CAP and Thresholds project." "This constitutes a failure to proceed

20 in the manner required by law."' "By inaccurately assuming the CAP and Thresholds

21 project was the same project as the general plan update, the County failed to analyze the
22 environmental impacts of the CAP and Thresholds project itself."

23 183. The County's approval of the 2018 CAP Project falls victim to the same

24 error. As explained by the County, the carbon offset program contained as part of CAP
25 Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1 is not the same project as the CAP itself.

26 184. At the January 18, 2018 Planning Commission meeting, County staff

27 assured the Commissioners (and the public) that the offset program contained in CAP
28 Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1 was not part of the CAP itself, stating:
45

NP The Climate Action Plan that is before the Commission today does not rely on offset credits, carbon credits outside of the county. You are
3 and I think what is confusing to this discussion is the reference to pending General Plan

4 Amendments. Those are clearly not a subject of this Climate Action Plan. This Climate Action Plan is mitigating the land

5 uses and activities that were programmed in the General Plan. So the relevancy of Generaf Plan amendments to this item, there is none.

6 If CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1's offset program is not part of the CAP itself, as

7

8 County staff represented to the public, then it must be a separate "project" under CEQA.
185.

9 At any rate, CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1 qualifies as a separate

10 CEQA project under statute and the CEQA Guidelines. (Pub. Res. Code § 21065; CEQA

11 Guidelines § 15378.) First, CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1's offset program will

12 cause a direct a physical environmental change because it inherently involves the use or

13 creation of mitigation projects all over the world. The offset program may also cause an

14 indirect change in the environment because it could facilitate unplanned growth in the
County (i.e., through General Plan amendment projects), causing a variety of impacts,
15 including traffic, noise, air quality, biological, energy consumption, planning,
16 environmental justice, and GHG impacts. Second, CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1's

17

18 offset program is directly undertaken by the County, which is a public agency.
186. Public interest in resolving the controversy is substantial. The public has a
19 significant interest in ensuring that CEQA's mandates are adhered to, in particular with

20

21 the requirement that the County analyze the potential environmental impacts of activities
that it undertakes that may have a direct or reasonably foreseeable indirect change to the
22 physical environment.

23 187. Judicial relief is essential to obtain the County's compliance with CEQA's
24 statutory mandate for EIRs to serve as adequate informational documents for both the
25 decisionmakers and the public. The County committed a prejudicial abuse of its
26 discretion under CEQA by failing to analyze the potential environmental impacts of the

7 189.

8 An actual and justiciable controversy has arisen and now exists between
Petitioner and the County concerning whether the County adequately analyzed the
9 impacts of its offset approach on energy impacts due to changes in County-wide VMT.

10 190.

11 The SEIR for the 2018 CAP Project relies on Appendix F of the CEQA

12 Guidelines to evaluate the CAP's potential impacts on energy use. (Final SEIR at p. 2.6-
13.)

13 191. As alleged herein, CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1 will have impacts to
14 County-wide VMT that have not been disclosed or discussed in the SEIR. Because the

15 SEIR's analysis of potential energy impacts does not analyze the potential impact of CAP
16 Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1's offset approach on County-wide VMT, it necessarily

17

18 fails to provide an adequate analysis of energy impacts under CEQA.

192. The Court of Appeal explained in Ukiah Citizens for Safety First v. City of
19 Ukiah (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 256, 264 -65, "The EIR certified by the city in this case in
20 December 2013 clearly fails to meet the standards set forth in CCEC, supra, 225

21

22 Cal.App.4th 173. As in that case, the Costco EIR concludes that the project will generate
11,204 new vehicle trips per weekday and 8,708 new trips per weekend day, but fails to
23 calculate the resulting energy impacts of those trips. The EIR also improperly relies on
24 compliance with the building code to mitigate operational and construction energy
25 impacts, without further discussion of the CEQA Guidelines, appendix F criteria. Finally,
26 as in CCEC, the city's reliance on mitigation measures designed to reduce greenhouse gas
27 emissions is misplaced."

16 195. Petitioner incorporates by reference the allegations contained in all
17 preceding paragraphs.

18 196. An actual and justiciable controversy has arisen and now exists between

19 Petitioner and the County concerning whether the County adequately analyzed the
20 impacts of its offset approach on environmental justice due to changes in County-wide

21 VMT, the County's ability to meet its own General Plan goals and policies related to
22 smart-growth development, and SANDAG's ability to meet its SB 375 requirements.

23 197. Public Resources Code section 21000(a) states, "The maintenance of a

24 quality environment for the people of this state now and in the future is a matter of
25 statewide concern."

26 198. Public Resources Code section 21000(g) states, "It is the intent of the

r environment, shall regulate such activities so that major consideration is given to
2 preventing environmental damage, while providing a decent home and satisfying living

4 199. Public Resources Code section 21001(b) states, "The Legislature further

5 finds and declares that it is the policy of the state to: ... (b) Take all action necessary to

6 provide the people of this state with clean air and water, enjoyment of aesthetic, natural,

7 scenic, and historic environmental qualities, and freedom from excessive noise."

8 200. Public Resources Code section 21001(d) states, "The Legislature further

9 finds and declares that it is the policy of the state to: ... (d) Ensure that the long-term
10 protection of the environment, consistent with the provision of a decent home and

11 suitable living environment for every Californian, shall be the guiding criterion in public

13 201. Public Resources Code section 21001(g) states, "The Legislature further

14 finds and declares that it is the policy of the state to: ... (g) Require governmental
15 agencies at all levels to consider qualitative factors as well as economic and technical
16 factors and long-term benefits and costs, in addition to short-term benefits and costs and

17 to consider alternatives to proposed actions affecting the environment."

18 202. Government Code section 11135(a) states, "No person in the State of
19 California shall, on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, ethnic
20 group identification, age, mental disability, physical disability, medical condition, genetic

21 information, marital status, or sexual orientation, be unlawfully denied full and equal

22 access to the benefits of, or be unlawfully subjected to discrimination under, any program

23 or activity that is conducted, operated, or administered by the state or by any state

24 agency, is funded directly by the state, or receives any financial assistance from the

25 state."

26 203. Government Code section 65040.12(e) defines "environmental justice" as
27 "the fair treatment of people of all races, cultures, and incomes with respect to the
28 development, adoption, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws,
49

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND LATHAM&WATKINS4P

RELIEF SAN DIEGO

1 regulations, and policies."

2 204. According to CARB's 2017 Scoping Plan, "[t]he transition to a low carbon

3 California economy provides an opportunity to not only reduce GHG emissions, but also

4 to reduce emissions of criteria pollutants and air toxins, and to create a healthier

5 environment for all of California's residents, especially those living in the State's most
6 disadvantaged communities." (2017 Scoping Plan at p. 15.)

7 205. On February 14, 2018, the County Board of Supervisors adopted

8 Resolution No. 18-023, entitled "Resolution of the County of San Diego Board of

9 Supervisors to apply for and accept grant funding to support the Climate Action Plan."
10 206. Goals and policies related to the reduction of VMT and the facilitation of
11 smart-growth policies promote environmental justice. Reduction of VMT reduces local

12 GHG emission impacts, the costs of which are disproportionately borne by lower income
13 communities. Similarly, smart-growth development revitalizes communities and adds

14 new economic opportunities in areas where individuals already live without the necessity

15 of privately owned vehicles.

16 207. Public commenters, in addition to the Golden Door, requested the County

17 to evaluate the economic and environmental justice issues implicated by the CAP. For
18 example, one public commenter noted that "cost of reducing GHGs should not be
19 unfairly born by lower income communities nor by communities which are already
20 suffering disproportionately higher amounts of pollution. For example, the incentives to

21 convert to more efficient vehicles and the infrastructure needed to support such vehicles

22 typically favor middle and higher income communities yet are funded by all income

23 groups."

24 208. Rather than seriously analyze these concerns, the County dismissed them

25 on the erroneous notion that emerging technology (e.g., electric vehicles) will at some
26 indeterminate point in the future obviate the need to consider VMT. For example, at the
27 January 18, 2018 Planning Commission meeting, the County's Director of Planning

28 stated, "electric vehicle and fuel cell vehicle programs shift that fuel from the carbon-
50
LATHAM&WATKINS4P
ATTORNEYS AT LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND

SAN DIEGO COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY
RELIEF

P based to a non-carbon-based which addresses the intent of VMT reduction."

2 209. Similarly, Supervisor Roberts stated at the February 14, 2018 Board of

3 Supervisors meeting prior to approval of the CAP Project, "Will vehicle mile travel go up

4 or down? I would argue that I'm not sure that that's an important issue as long as the
5 greenhouse gases are going down."

6 210. The County's assumptions are misguided and fail to adequately consider

7 the CAP's impacts to environmental justice. VMT reduction is not just about reducing

8 GHG impacts, but also about reducing the numerous quality of life impacts on all

9 residents when VMTs are excessive. This is a particularly salient issue for lower income
10 individuals and families who must use public transportation. Lower income individuals

11 and families are also adversely affected by sprawl development, when new economic
12 opportunities are not sited near existing transit centers but in relatively distant locations

13 that require use of a personal vehicle. Furthermore, electrification of vehicles does not
14 necessarily alleviate traffic congestion, which causes delays in public transportation and

15 further damage to economic opportunity for many County residents. As in Ukiah Citizens
16 for Safety First v. City of Ukiah (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 256, the County's assumption

17 that GHG emissions necessarily proxies for VMT is an erroneous one that cannot be

18 supported by substantial evidence.

19 211. CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1's offset approach also has impacts to
20 environmental justice that went unanalyzed in the CAP SEIR. First, as alleged herein,

21 CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1's offset approach addressed only GHG emissions

22 and not VMT reduction. Second, CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1's offset approach
23 permits GHG emissions increases within the County in exchange for commitments for

24 emissions decreases outside of the County. This approach could deprive County residents

25 of important co-benefits from improved air quality and public health, which would
26 disproportionately impact those in disadvantaged communities. Moreover, failing to
27 implement off-site offset projects within the unincorporated County would deprive
28 County residents of important investment in the green economy that could stimulate
51

- economic growth. This is clearly inconsistent with state law mandates that there be "fair

2 treatment of people of all races, cultures, and incomes with respect to the development,

3 adoption, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and

4 policies."

5 212. The County did not analyze whether it is fair for County residents to bear

6 the various costs of increased GHG emissions within the County-whether from

7 increased VMT or from construction or operation of new development projectswhile

8 individuals elsewhere in the state, the nation, or the world enjoy the benefits of decreased

9 GHG emissions in their communities. The County's failure to analyze these issues, which
10 result from direct or reasonably foreseeable indirect physical changes to the environment
11 from the CAP, including CAP Mitigation Measure M-GHG-1, violated the informational
12 mandates of CEQA.

13 213. Public interest in resolving the controversy is substantial. The public has a
14 significant interest in ensuring the County's compliance with its CEQA's informational

15 mandates, in particular in the disclosure and analysis of potential environmental impacts
16 that implicate environmental justice issues.

17 214. Judicial relief is essential to obtain the County's compliance with CEQA's

18 statutory mandate for EIRs to serve as adequate informational documents for both the
19 decisionmakers and the public, in particular in the disclosure and analysis of potential
20 environmental impacts that implicate environmental justice issues. The County did not

21 proceed a in a manner required by law because it failed to disclose or analyze potential
22 environmental impacts that implicate environmental justice issues, based in part on the
23 erroneous assumption that GHG emissions impacts are proxy for impacts from VMT.

COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS
WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 2018

MINUTE ORDER NO. 1

SUBJECT: NOTICED PUBLIC HEARING:
COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO CLIMATE ACTION PLAN AND GENERAL PLAN
AMENDMENT; POD15-002; GPA16-007 (DISTRICTS: ALL)

OVERVIEW
Today's request is for the Board of Supervisors (Board) to approve an achievable, enforceable, and measurable Climate Action Plan (CAP), which includes measures to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from County of San Diego (County) local government operations and from activities within the unincorporated county.

The State of California (State) has emphasized reducing GHG emissions and preparing for the associated weather changes that can affect sea-level rise, wildfires, water supply, and other risks. In 2005, the State set a goal to reduce statewide emissions to 80% below 1990 GHG emissions levels by
2050. Since then, two sets of legislation codified statewide GHG reduction targets to reduce emissions
to 1990 levels by 2020 and to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030.

In addition to the State mandate, the 2011 General Plan Update (2011 GPU) Program Environmental
Impact Report adopted several mitigation measures to minimize the significant effects of climate change
in connection with the build out of the General Plan, including the development of a CAP to a reduce GHG emissions consistent with State targets applicable at that time. The initial CAP approved by the Board on June 20, 2012 (4) (2012 CAP) was subsequently challenged in court and invalidated. After litigation concluded, the Board rescinded the 2012 CAP and staff began preparing an entirely new CAP on April 8, 2015 (9).

To meet State targets, the County must reduce total GHG emissions by 520,703 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2e) by 2020 and 1,796,692 MTCO2e by 2030. The County is on track to meet its 2020 target. For the 2030 target, State legislation and actions will help reduce GHG emissions locally by 899,547 MTCO2e, leaving the County responsible for reducing the remaining 897,145
MTCO2e.

On August 10, 2017, the County released, for public review, a draft: CAP (August 2017 CAP); Supplemental Environmental Impact Report (SEIR); General Plan Amendment; Guidelines for Determining Significance for Climate Change that included a draft Greenhouse Gas Threshold of Significance; Report Format and Content Requirements for Climate Change; and Climate Action Plan Consistency Review Checklist. The August 2017 CAP identified GHG emissions, projections, and reduction targets for the county's unincorporated areas and County operations, and included reduction measures to ensure the County meets the State 2020 and 2030 targets.
Based on comments received during the public review period, at informational meetings held throughout the region, and at Planning Commission meetings, staff has revised the August 2017 CAP to a create a draft Final Climate Action Plan (draft Final CAP). The draft Final CAP includes 30 measures
that address opportunities and constraints of the region's diverse landscape of open spaces, rural villages, and agricultural lands. It is structured to advance and build upon the 2011 GPU's vision and guiding principles to promote health,

sustainability, environmental stewardship, vitality of the local economy, and individual character of
existing communities. It also aligns with the County's existing plans and programs, such as the County's Strategic Energy Plan and the Strategic Plan to Reduce Waste.

This is a request for the Board to receive the draft Final CAP. Based on comments received during
stakeholder input, a staff recommendation and three additional options were developed and are included for the Board's consideration. In addition, a Planning Commission recommendation is included in this report. All are covered in the analysis of the draft Final SEIR and none would result in any new
significant environmental impacts. The three options focus on addressing: (1) a desire for increased reliance on renewable energy; (2) impacts from increased up-front costs on housing; and (3) impacts
from increased up-front costs on residential and non-residential development.

RECOMMENDATION(S)
PLANNING COMMISSION
On January 18, 2018, the Planning Commission considered the draft Final Climate Action Plan and related information, and the draft Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Report.

FISCAL IMPACT
There is no fiscal impact associated with these recommendations to adopt the draft Final Climate Action Plan (draft Final CAP) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2017-18. Proposed FY 2017-18 draft Final CAP implementation costs in of $31.2 million are included in the FY 2017-18 Operational Plan in the participating departments for the programs that will contribute to the draft Final CAP ($31.0 million for existing programs and $200,000 for new or expanded programs). There will be no change in net General Fund cost and no additional staff years in FY 2017-18.
The Climate Action Plan Implementation Cost Report (Attachment H-1) estimates the County's future costs to implement the draft Final CAP through FY 2022-23. This timeframe represents the "start-up" phase of the plan. Certain draft Final CAP measures may be implemented that have costs beyond the scope of this initial cost analysis, including implementation of the Local Direct Investment Program and Renewable Energy Program.
Of the total projected $236.4 million implementation cost beginning in FY 2017-18 through FY 2022-23, existing funded programs account for about 90% (approximately $212.1 million). New and expanded programs account for about 10% of the projected implementation cost (approximately $24.3 million) and of this amount, approximately $9.3 million can be funded by existing resources, while roughly $15.0 million represents currently unfunded activities. Potential funding sources for the identified unfunded activities include available prior year fund balance (one-time-only funding), General Purpose Revenue, grants, and if needed, future cost recovery fees, such as building permits.
Further, based on the Climate Action Plan Implementation Cost Report, it is anticipated that there will be a staffing impact from implementation of the draft Final CAP, with a total of 12.00 new full-time equivalent (FTE) positions estimated, including 4.00 FTEs in FY 2018-19, 3.00 FTEs in FY 2019-20,
4.00 FTEs in FY 2020-21, and 1.00 FTE in FY 2021-22. Proposed new staffing, by department, is the addition of 9.00 FTEs in Planning & Development Services, and 3.00 FTEs in the Air Pollution Control District through FY 2022-23.

Operational costs, funding source(s), and staffing impacts from the activities approved based on the draft Final CAP will be included by various departments in future Operational Plans beginning in FY 2018-19, subject to approval by the Board of Supervisors.

BUSINESS IMPACT STATEMENT
The proposed project will result in greenhouse gas reductions and other co-benefits such as improved air quality, green economy job growth, and reduced household transportation costs. Measures also have direct and indirect economic benefits; improving energy and water-use efficiency has the potential to lower operation costs for residents and businesses. Reduced energy and water costs could lead residents
and businesses to invest and spend more in the local economy. Progressive building design and construction practices can reduce the demand for imported energy. Local clean energy projects such as residential solar installations, utility scale solar and wind projects, and electric vehicle charging stations can result in more local investment, local jobs, and money circulating in the local economy.
Reinvestment in local buildings, public facilities, parks, and infrastructure will provide new opportunities for skilled trades and professional services.

ACTION 1.1:
MOTION by Supervisor Gaspar, seconded by Supervisor Horn, to adopt the Planning Commission's
recommendations.

(No action taken; A substitute motion was made by Supervisor Roberts)

FEBRUARY 14, 2018 4

ACTION 1.2:
