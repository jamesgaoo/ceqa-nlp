12192320.3 a04/12/18 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT

Petitioners and Plaintiffs PROTECT CEQA and STEFANIE OLIVIERI (collectively
2 referred to herein as "Petitioners") respectfully petitions this Court for issuance of a writ of mandate
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure ("CCP") section 1094.5 and Public Resources Code ("PRC")

4 section 21168, or in the alternative pursuant to CCP § 1085 and PRC § 21168.5, and complains for

5 the issuance of temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief and for a declaration of its a

6 rights pursuant to CCP §§ 526 and 1060, directed at Respondents and Defendants TOWN OF
7 TRUCKEE ("Town") and TOWN COUNCIL OF THE TOWN OF TRUCKEE ("Town Council,"

8 and collectively with Town and Does 1-20, "Respondents"), and Real Party in Interest (J-MAR 1,
9 LLC ("Real Party" or "Developer" and collectively with Roes 1-20, "Real Parties"), as follows:

10 I. INTRODUCTION

11 1. This action challenges the March 13, 2018, decision of the Town Council to approve
12 a retail development project known as Soaring Ranch (the "Project"). The Project site consists of a
13 16.3 acre parcel located at the southeast intersection of State Route ("SR") 267 and Brockway Road
14 (the "Property") in the Joerger Ranch Specific Plan (*JRSP") area. In approving the Project, the
15 Town violated State law by, among others, failing to analyze its potentially significant
16 environmental impacts as required by the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") (PRC
17 § 21000 et seq.), and by ignoring its own plans and policies in contravention of the Planning &
18 Zoning Law (Gov. Code § 65000 et seq.).

19 2. Appropriately concerned about the economic impacts of development on its
20 Downtown, "Truckee's heart and lifeblood," the Town retained a consultant to prepare an economic
21 impact study of the JRSP prior to its adoption. (JRSP, p. 1.2.) The study concluded that in light of
22 existing and proposed grocery stores, there was not sufficient demand for a full-size grocery store

23 at the Project site. The Project would be anchored by an approximately 36,000 square foot Raley's
24 grocery store. Ignoring the report, and in violation of State and local laws, the Town nonetheless
25 proceeded to approve the Project without the requisite analysis and public review of the potentially
26 significant environmental impacts of the Project on the Town's Downtown and other nearby stores
27 and commercial centers.

28 3. The challenged Project approvals include the following determinations, decisions,

-2-
2696/034616-0001
12192320.3 a04/12/18 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT

n & Tucker, LLP

and actions taken by the Town Council in connection with its adoption of Resolution 2018-15 on

2 March 13, 2018: (1) Deny the appeal of the Planning Commission's approval of the Soaring Ranch

3 Project and uphold the decision of the Planning Commission, with the exception of removing

4 Commission-recommended Condition of Approval #97, modifying Condition of Approval #86 and
adding Environmental Impact Report Mitigation Measures 3.2-4, 3.2-5, 3.2-6 and 3.2-7 as
6 Conditions of Approval #99-102; (2) Determine the Project consistent with the adopted JRSP; (3)
7 Find that no further environmental review is required consistent with CEQA Guidelines Section
8 15183 (Projects Consistent with a Community Plan, General Plan or Zoning) and Section 21166
9 (Lead agency prohibition to require subsequent reports for a certified project unless specific events);
10 and (4) Approve the Development Permit, Tentative Map and Planned Development for the Project
11 based on the recommended findings and subject to the recommended conditions of approval
12 (collectively, the "Project Approvals").

13 4. The Town's approval of the Project violated CEQA in several respects. Because
14 there was a fair a argument of significant urban decay impacts, the Town was required to prepare an
15 environmental impact report ("EIR") for the Project. The Town instead purported to rely on an EIR
16 for the JRSP which did not study the urban decay impacts of the Project. Even if the Town could
17 have evaluated the Project in a subsequent review context, substantial changes occurred and/or new

18 information of substantial importance arose which obligated the Town to prepare a subsequent EIR
19 analyzing the urban decay impacts of the Project. The Town refused to do this, relying instead on

20 a negative declaration which it failed to circulate for public review and comment for 30 days, as
21 required. The Town also failed to make the requisite CEQA findings in connection with its approval
22 of the Project.

23 5. The Town's approval of the Project is inconsistent with both the General Plan and
24 the JRSP. The Project is rural sprawl that threatens the integrity of Truckee's Downtown and other
25 nearby commercial areas. Contrary to the Town's planning policies, the Project does not contain
26 any housing to support the estimated 200 employees needed for Phase I let alone the 350 plus full-
27 time employees needed when the center is fully built-out. Likewise, it does not provide the
28 | infrastructure required by the General Plan and JRSP. As a result, these important features will not

-3-
2696/034616-0001
12192320.3 a04/12/18 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT

n & Tucker, LLP

be built for years to come, if at all.

2 6. In connection with its approval of the Project, the Town also violated the Planning
& Zoning Law and the Brown Act. (Gov. Code § 65000 et seq. and Gov. Code § 54950 et seq.)

4 The public notice failed to indicate that the Town Council was proposing to remove and modify
conditions of approval imposed by the Planning Commission on the Project, neither of which are
6 allowed by the Town's Development Code. The Town failed to make required findings when

7 approving the Project, and the few findings it did make were not supported by substantial evidence
8 in light of the entire record, as required. Further, the agenda of the Town Council's March 13, 2018,
9 hearing on the Project failed to inform the public that the Town Council was proposing to adopt a
10 negative declaration in connection with its approval of the Project.

11 7. Because the Town's approval of the Project violates numerous state and local laws,
12 including, CEQA, the Planning & Zoning Law, the Brown Act, the General Plan, the JRSP, and the
13 Development Code it must be set aside.

14 I. THE PARTIES

15 8. Petitioner and Plaintiff Protect CEQA is an unincorporated, non-profit, public
16 interest community association committed to protecting CEQA and to promoting smart growth
17 development.

18 9. Petitioner and Plaintiff Stefanie Olivieri owns property in Truckee and in the vicinity
19 of the Project. Ms. Olivieri is also the owner of a small business located in Downtown Truckee.

20 10. Petitioners testified and/or submitted comment letters and other objections
21 expressing concerns about the Respondents' plans for, and inadequate consideration of, the
22 proposed Project at all appropriate times up to and including the final Town Council hearing to
23 approve the Project on March 13, 2018. Petitioners objected to the approval of the Project both
24 orally and/or in writing prior to the close of the public hearing before the filing of the notice of
25  determination.

26 11. Petitioners have significant interests in ensuring that Respondents adequately
27 analyze and mitigate the environmental impacts of the Project as well as properly evaluate the
28 Project under its General Plan and JRSP. Petitioners have a beneficial interest in the outcome of

-4-
2696/034616-0001
12192320.3 a04/12/18 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT
n & Tucker, LLP

1 this case for themselves, and in the case of Protect CEQA, on behalf of its members.

2 12. Petitioners bring this action in the public interest, for enforcement of the important
3 public rights and environmental interests intended to be protected by CEQA and for the enforcement
4 of the Town's own planning policies, as well as statutory and constitutional rights to fair, impartial,
5 and timely public review, and to assure compliance with CEQA and other applicable provisions of

6 law implicated by the Respondents' unlawful actions.

13. Respondent/Defendant Town is, and at all times mentioned herein was, a California
charter city and municipal corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of
California. The Town has a mandatory duty to comply with the California Constitution, state law
10 requirements, including CEQA, the Planning & Zoning Law, and the Brown Act, as well as its own
11 Charter and Town Code, when considering discretionary activities and land use regulatory actions
12 such as the Project Approvals.

13 14. Respondent/Defendant Town Council is the elected decision-making body of the
14 Town that issued the challenged Project Approvals for the Project.

15 15. Petitioners are ignorant of the true names and capacities of those sued herein as
16 DOES 1 through 20, inclusive, and therefore sues those respondents/defendants by such fictitious
17 names. Petitioners will amend this Petition to allege the true names and capacities of these
18 fictitiously named respondents/defendants when they have been ascertained. Petitioners designate
19 all other unknown persons or entities claiming any interest in the subject of this litigation as DOE
20 respondents/defendants.

21 16. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that Real Party in Interest
22 J-MAR 1, LLC is, and at all times mentioned herein was, a Delaware limited liability company
23 conducting business in the State of California, including the Town. Petitioners are informed and
24 believe, and thereon allege, that Real Party is the recipient or intended beneficiary of the Project
25 Approvals. Real Party is identified as the Project applicant on the Notice of Determination filed by
26 the Town.

27 17. Petitioners are ignorant of the true names and capacities of those sued herein as
28 ROES 1 through 20, inclusive, and therefore sues those real parties in interest by such fictitious

1 names. Petitioners will amend this Petition to allege the true names and capacities of these
2 fictitiously named real parties in interest when they have been ascertained. Petitioners designate all
3 other unknown persons or entities claiming any interest in the subject of this litigation as ROE real

4 parties in interest.

5 III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

6 18. This Court has jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to CCP §§ 1085, 1094.5,
7 and 1060, and CEQA, including but not limited to PRC §§ 21168 and 21168.5.

8 19. Venue in this Court is proper pursuant to CCP § 394, in that Respondents are located
9 within the County of Nevada.

10 20. All facts and issues raised in this Petition were presented to Respondents prior to
11 Respondents' decision to issue the Project Approvals on March 13, 2018. Petitioners have duly
12 exhausted all available administrative remedies, and submitted timely objections orally and/or in
13| writing, prior to Respondents' final approval of the Project.

14 IV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

15 A. Project Description

16 21. The Project consists of a 124,000 square foot retail center on a 16.3 acre parcel
17 located in the southeast quadrant of the JRSP Area. According to Town Staff, the Project would be
18 the only regional commercial center in Truckee. (Staff Powerpoint Presentation, January 16, 2018,
19 Planning Commission hearing on the Project.) The center includes a 35,704 square foot Raley's
20 grocery store plus an additional 88,000 square feet of retail space. (Staff Report for January 16,
21 2018, Planning Commission hearing on the Project [*PC Staff Report"], p.I.)

22 22. The Project is proposed to be developed in phases. Phase 1 (5.5 acres) would contain
23| the Raley's store with an attached 12,000 square foot co-anchor and 7,000 square foot commercial
24 building. Phase 2 (5.4 acres) is shown as including 65,000 square feet of commercial development
25 within four retail buildings. Phase 3 (5.4 acres) is designated for "Unidentified uses." However,
26 Developer submitted plans showing this site as developed with 80 or more housing units. (PC Staff
27 Report, Attachment 2.) At the Town Council's March 13, 2018, hearing the Developer likewise
28 testified to his plans to develop the Phase 3 site with housing.

-6-
2695/034616-0001
12192320.3 a04/12/18 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT

n & Tucker, LLP

1 23. The entitlements sought by the Developer included a Tentative Map to subdivide the
2 Property into three parcels corresponding with the associated phases, a Development Permit to allow
construction of the Phase 1 development, and "Planned Development" approval to allow deviations
4 from the Town's sign regulations. Developer did not seek and was not granted Planned
5 Development approval of the entire development as required by the JRSP nor was it granted

6 variances from the Town's sign regulations as required by the Development Code.

7 B. Planning History

8 24. The Property is undeveloped and primarily undisturbed. (PC Staff Report, p. 3.) The

9 site is relatively flat with dense tree coverage along the southwest boundary. (Id.) It is highly visible
10 from SR 267 with large expanses of open meadow visible along Soaring Way. (Id.)

11 25. The Property is designated Planned Community ("PC") by the Town's General Plan.
12 Development on the site is to be "a range of commercial, industrial and residential uses." (General
13 Plan, Policy PC3-P1.) The design of retail shopping areas are to avoid "strip commercial" site layout
14 and be oriented and scaled to the pedestrian realm. (General Plan, Policy PC3-P4.) Further,
15 provisions are to be made for supplying, on-site, the required housing for at least 50 percent of the
16 very-low, low-, and moderate-income workforce associated with development of the site. (General
17 Plan, Policy PC3-P6.)

18 26. The Property is designated (and zoned) Regional Commercial ("CR") by the JRSP.
19 Development within the CR zone is intended to supply retail service needs of the local population
20 and recreational tourist population that serves the area. (JRSP, Policy P7.3.) While grocery stores
21 are an allowed use, the JRSP stresses the need to capture the leakage of retail sales tax dollars to
22 neighboring jurisdictions and avoid competition with Downtown. (See, e.g., JRSP, pp. 2.2 to 2.3

23 and 4.14; see also JRSP, Policy P7.3.) Specifically, national retail chains are discouraged unless it
24 can be demonstrated through an economic analysis that such a use will benefit the Town as a whole a
25 and avoid or minimize economic impacts to Downtown.' (JRSP, p. 4.14.)

26 27. In conjunction with its consideration and ultimate approval of the JRSP in March

27

28 Raley's is the 38th largest supermarket chain in the United States, with 150 stores and 17,500 employees across its four divisions. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raley%27s_Supermarkets.)

2696/034616-0001
12192320.3 a04/12/18 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT

n & Tucker, LLP

2015, the Town Council relied on an economic analysis prepared by Bay Area Economics (the
2 "BAE Report") to ensure that new businesses would not adversely impact its Downtown. (JRSP,
3 pp. 1.2 and 1.3.) Due to insufficient market demand for grocery store space, the BAE Report
4 specifically concluded that a full-size grocery store was "not suitable" for the JRSP area. (BAE
5 Report, p. 16.) It stated that a full-size grocery store on the Project site would be "problematic," in
6 light of existing grocery store space, and planned space that would take up "a large portion of the
7 demand for about 50,000 square feet of grocery space in Truckee through 2023." (Id.) The BAE
8 Report opines that the success of a grocery store on the Site "would likely be at the expense of other
9 Truckee grocery stores given the limited overall increase in demand through 2023." (Id.)

10 28. Since the JRSP was adopted, the Town approved a 34,483 square foot Nugget Market
11 Downtown as part of the Truckee Railyard Project as well as 17,568 square foot Grocery Outlet

12 store at Donner Pass Road and Vista Avenue.2 These two projects alone exceed BAE's estimated
13 demand of 50,000 square feet of grocery space through 2023. (Id.) The Project would exacerbate
14 this situation by adding yet another full-size grocery store to the mix.

15 29. Further the General Plan and JRSP both require that all new non-residential projects
16 provide affordable housing to meet Truckee's specific needs. (General Plan, Housing Element,
17 Goal H-1, Policy H-1.1, Programs H-1.2.4 and H-5.1.6, and pages HB-27 to HB-28; General Plan,
18 Land Use Element, Policy PC3-P6; General Plan, Community Character Element, Policy P9.3;
19 JRSP, JR Goal 8; and Development Code, Chapter 18.216; see also PC Staff Report, p. 8 [Staff
20 acknowledges the General Plan's Housing Element "requires that all new non-residential projects
21 provide affordable housing to meet Truckee's housing needs."].) Although the Developer has stated
22 that he will apply to develop the Phase 3 parcel with housing, he 3 made it clear that this would be
23 market rate housing. (Minutes of March 13, 2018, Town Council hearing on Project ["TC
24 Minutes"], p. 6.) The approved Project contains no affordable -or workforce housing for the
25 estimated hundreds of new employees. This is especially alarming given that the Tahoe-Truckee
26 region is already short 12,000 housing units. (Truckee North Tahoe Housing Study, BAE 2016.)

27

28 2 The developer of the Grocery Outlet store recently submitted an application to modify the Town's approval of that project.

C. Public Hearings and Project Approval

2 30. On January 16, 2018, the Planning Commission conducted a public hearing on the
3 Project. In advance of the hearing, Petitioner Protect CEQA and others raised concerns that the
4 Town had not complied with CEQA by failing to analyze the Project's potentially significant urban
decay impacts. (See, e.g., January 15, 2018, letter from Sustainable Truckee to the Town; January
6 16, 2018, letter from Protect CEQA to the Town.) They also asserted that the Project was
7 inconsistent with the Town's General Plan and the JRSP by failing to provide needed roadway
8 I infrastructure. (Id.)

9 31. Commissioner David Polivy likewise raised concerns with respect to the Project's
10 potential to cause urban decay. He noted that "There is not enough market rate housing to support
11 over 100,000 square feet of new commercial space. It would be nice to get an updated economic
12 analysis. I think we also need to look at how we'll repurpose whatever commercial space does go
13 empty." (Minutes of January 16, 2018, Planning Commission on Project ["PC Minutes"], p. 11.)
14 He pointed out that a 5,000 square foot tenant had recently vacated the Safeway Shopping Center
15 and cautioned that the Town "need[s] to be careful about how we time and phase these projects.*
16  (Id.)

17 32. Although it was presented with a fair argument of significant environmental impacts,
18 the Town did not prepare an EIR or adopt the necessary findings (and likely statement of overriding
19 considerations) in connection with its approval of the Project. Instead, it initially purported to rely
20 on the Project's consistency with the JRSP EIR pursuant to PRC § 21083.3. Per that provision, the
21 Town was required to analyze the peculiar impacts of the Project, including the potentially
22 significant urban decay impacts. The Town did not do so.

23 33. Ultimately, the Planning Commission adopted Resolution No. 2018-01 approving
24 the Project. Concerned by the potential for smaller tenant spaces to compete with uses in the
25 Downtown, the Planning Commission imposed Condition 97 on the Project. (PC Minutes, pp. 11,
26 14.) That condition required preparation of an economic impact study prior to approval of retail
27  uses of less than 5,000 square feet in size.

28 34. On January 26, 2018, an appeal of the Planning Commission's action was filed by

-9-
2696/034616-0001
12192320.3 a04/12/18 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT

n & Tucker, LLP

Petitioner Protect CEQA and William F. Griffin, III (collectively referred to herein as the
2 "Appellants"). Mr. Griffin, a 30 year resident, owns and operates New Moon Natural Foods in
3 Truckee. He expressed concern that the Project was "like to cause major disruptions in Truckee's
economy for years to come." ("Raley's Store Approval Disregards the Bigger Picture," Moonshine
Ink, February 8, 2018.)

6 35. Comment letters were submitted to the Town in support of the Appeal noting the
7 Town's violation of CEQA and the Project's inconsistency with the General Plan and JRSP. The
8 Town failed to effectively address the issues raised in those letters. The letters, submitted on behalf

9 of Appellants and others, were supported by an economic impact analysis prepared by Area
10 Research Associates ("ARA"). (See "Impacts on Existing Area Supermarkets from Proposed New

11 Supermarkets, Truckee, California," Area Research Associates, December 17, 2018.) The ARA
12 Report concludes that the Project will force Save Mart and New Moon Natural Foods to close
13 because they will incur sales below break-even profitability levels. Save Mart anchors the
14 Crossroads Shopping Center, a 100,000 square foot neighborhood shopping center located on
15| Highway 89. As noted by Chris Hinkel, Real Estate Professional with Sierra Sotheby's International
16 Realty, in her March 6, 2018, email to Town Planner Jenna Gatto, "having a vacant building in that
17 strip mall would not be good for the community or the other businesses in there."

18 36. On February 27, 2018, the Town Council opened and continued a public hearing on
19 the Appeal to March 13, 2018. A few days before that hearing, the Town released a staff report a
20 ("TC Staff Report") claiming that the Project qualified for subsequent review under the JRSP EIR.

21 An Initial Study Checklist/Negative Declaration was attached to the TC Staff Report. Contrary to
22 CEQA, it was not circulated for the mandatory 30 day public review and comment period. (CEQA
23 Guidelines §§ 15072, 15105, 15162.)

24 37. Appellants submitted comment letters responding to the TC Staff Report and testified
25 at the March 13, 2018, Town Council hearing. (See, e.g., letters dated February 26, 2018, February
26 27, 2018, March 12, 2018, and March 13, 2018, from Appellants and/or Appellant's representatives
27 to Town Council; see also TC Minutes, p. 4.) Petitioner Stefanie Olivieri also testified noting that
28 the Town failed to perform the requisite analysis of urban decay impacts. (TC Minutes, p. 10.)

n & Tucker, LLP

Resident Kane Schaller also expressed concerns with the Project's lack of housing, noting that
2 businesses cannot secure an adequate workforce because there is not sufficient housing for
3 employees. (TC Minutes, p. 11.) He and resident Megan Evans urged that housing not be deferred,
4 but instead be provided as part of the Phase 1 development. (TC 1 Minutes, pp. 10-11.)

5 38. As with the prior comments received from Appellants and others skeptical of the

6 Town's processing of the Project, the Town Council failed to meaningfully respond to those
7 concerns. For instance, Staff expressed the view that the Project's urban decay impacts were

8 adequately analyzed as part of the JRSP EIR. (TC Minutes, p. 5.) That claim was directly refuted
9 by a BAE consultant, now working for the Developer, who testified that the BAE Report "was not
10| intended to evaluate potential blight." (TC Minutes, p. 6.)

11 39. Ultimately, with one member absent and one member abstaining, the Town Council
12 narrowly voted to approve the Project.

13 40. On March 14, 2018, the Town filed a Notice of Determination, providing notice of
14 its approval of the Project.

15 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

16 (Petition for Writ of Mandate for Violations of CEQA)

17 41. Petitioners hereby incorporate the allegations of the foregoing paragraphs as though
18 set forth in full herein by this reference.

19 42. The primary purpose of CEQA is to ensure that governmental decision-makers and
20 the public are informed of the potentially significant environmental impacts of proposed projects or
21 activities before they are approved. As such, before a public agency approves any discretionary
22 project, the agency must first identify, assess, and publicly disclose the project's potential
23 environmental effects. An agency may not approve a project that has the potential to have
24 significant environmental impacts if there are feasible alternatives or mitigation measures that would
25 avoid or substantially lessen the adverse environmental impacts.

26 43. In doing or refraining to do the things herein alleged, Respondents failed to comply
27 with their mandatory duties under CEQA in several substantial and prejudicial respects, including
28 without limitation, as set forth below.

2696/034616-0001 -11-

12192320.3 a04/12/18 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT

n & Tucker, LLP

44. a Because there is a fair argument of significant environmental impacts, the Town was
2 required to prepare an EIR prior to approving the Project. In particular, the Town was presented
with substantial evidence of fair argument that the Project may result in significant urban decay

4 impacts. Urban decay has been defined as "physical deterioration of properties or structures that is

5 so prevalent, substantial, and lasting a significant period of time that it impairs the proper utilization
6 of the properties and structures, and the health, safety, and welfare of the surrounding community."
7 (Placerville Historic Preservation League v. Judicial Council of California (2017) 16 Cal.App.5th
8 187, 192.) The Town failed to adequately disclose, analyze, or identify mitigation measures for the
9 Project's significant individual and cumulative impacts on the environment in this regard.
10 Respondents' finding that the Project will not have any significant impacts is thus unsupported by
11 substantial evidence.

12 45. The Town was also presented with substantial evidence of a fair argument that the
13 Project would increase vehicle miles traveled. This would result in associated significant impacts

14 to traffic, air quality, greenhouse gas ("GHG") cmissions, noise, and land use. The Town failed to
15 adequately disclose, analyze, or identify mitigation measures for the Project's significant individual
16 and cumulative impacts on the environment in this regard. Respondents' finding that the Project
17 will not have any significant impacts is thus unsupported by substantial evidence.

18 46. In addition, the Project would result in significant but unacknowledged (new, and
19 not previously-studied) impacts with respect to its inconsistencies with land use policies adopted for
20 the purposes of avoiding or mitigating significant environmental impacts. (CEQA Guidelines,
21 Appendix G, Section X.b; Pocket Protectors v. City of Sacramento (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 903.)
22 Respondents' finding that the Project will not have any significant impacts is thus unsupported by
23 substantial evidence.

24 47. The Town failed to provide a complete, accurate, finite, and stable description of the
25 Project. While the Developer submitted plans for and testified to his plans to proceed with
26 development of 80 housing units, the Town failed to acknowledge, let alone analyze, the potentially
27 significant environmental impacts associated with this development. This development is a
28 reasonably foreseeable consequence of the Project, yet the Town refused to address it. In a similar

-12-
2696/034616-0001
12192320.3 a04/12/18 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT

n & Tucker, LLP

case, the California Supreme Court flatly rejected an agency's failure to analyze the impacts of a
reasonably foreseeable future phase. (Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n. V. Regents of University
of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376.) At minimum, the residential development should have been

4 identified as a probable future cumulative project. Instead, the Town pleaded ignorance as to the
5 uses associated with Phase 3, claiming they were unknown and undetermined.

6 48. Days prior to its approval of the Project, the Town first purported to rely on the

7 subsequent review standards set forth in PRC § 21166. Those standards are inapplicable because
8 the EIR that was previously prepared was for the JRSP and not for the Soaring Ranch Project. An

9 agency cannot perform subsequent review based on an EIR that was previously prepared for a
10 different project. (PRC 21166; CEQA Guidelines § 15162.)

11 49. Even assuming that the Town could rely on the JRSP EIR for purposes of subsequent
12 CEQA review, substantial changes have occurred and/or new information of substantial importance
13 has arisen, which show that the Project will have new or substantially more severe impacts. (PRC
14 § 21166; CEQA Guidclincs § 15162; Mira Monte Homeowners Ass'n. v. County of Ventura (1985)
15 165 Cal.App.3d 357.) Specifically, in light of recent actions by the Town to approve two other
16 grocery store projects (Nugget and Grocery Outlet), insufficient demand exists for the Project
17 grocery store, such that it will likely result in significant urban decay impacts. The Town cannot
18 proceed with the Project unless and until it prepares a subsequent EIR analyzing and addressing this

19 issue.

20 50. In addition to these CEQA flaws, the Project also suffers from fundamentally fatal
21 procedural flaws. The Negative Declaration attached to the TC Staff Report was not circulated for
22 public review and comment for the minimum 30 day period as required by CEQA Guidelines
23 §§ 15072, 15105, and 15162. Additionally, and contrary to the Brown Act, nothing in the Agenda
24 for the March 13, 2018, Town Council meeting or any prior meetings on the Project indicated that
25 the Town was proposing to adopt a Negative Declaration. (Gov. Code con 54954.2; San Joaquin
26 Raptor Rescue Center v. County of Merced (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 1167.) The Negative
27 Declaration further fails to comply with CEQA since it does not contain any analysis of the peculiar
28 impacts of the Project, e.g., with respect to urban decay, vehicle miles traveled, traffic, air quality,

-13-
2696/034616-0001
12192320.3 a04/12/18 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT

n & Tucker, LLP

F GHG emissions, noise, and land use. (PRC § 21083.3(b) and CEQA Guidelines § 15183(b).)

2 51. The Town also failed to make required findings when approving the Project. As to
3 those impacts for which it purported to impose mitigation measures on the Project, the Town did
4 not make the requisite findings that "[c]hanges or alterations have been required in, or incorporated
5 into, the project which mitigate or avoid the significant effects on the environment." (PRC § 21081;
6 CEQA Guidelines § 15091.) The Town similarly failed to adopt a Mitigation Monitoring and
7 Reporting Program for these measures. (PRC § 21081.6; CEQA Guidelines § 15097.)

8 52. As to the significant unavoidable air quality impacts identified in the JRSP EIR (e.g.,
9 Impact 3.1-1 and Impact 4-1), the Town likewise failed to make the requisite findings and adopt the
10 mandatory statement of overriding considerations. (PRC § 21081; CEQA Guidelines §§ 15091,
11 15093.) Such findings and statement of overriding considerations can only lawfully be made in
12 conjunction with certification of an EIR. (CEQA Guidelines §§ 15092, 15093.)

13 53. Respondents further violated CEQA by adopting findings that do not provide the
14| reasoning, or analytic route, from facts to conclusions, as required by law. The purported findings
15 made by the Town were not supported by substantial evidence in light of the whole record.

16 54. As a result of the foregoing defects, the Town's actions in approving the Project were
17 not in compliance with procedures required by law, were not supported by substantial evidence in
18 the public record, were not reflected in legally adequate findings, and were arbitrary, capricious,
19 and reflected a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

20 55. Petitioners have no plain, adequate and speedy remedy at law to redress the wrongs
21 described in this Petition.

22 56. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this action and
23 have exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law, including
24 by submitting written and/or oral comments objecting to the Project, the Project Approvals, and the
25 failure to comply with CEQA. To the extent any matter raised in this Petition was not addressed in
26 Petitioners' comments, Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that such matters
27 were raised by other persons or entities who objected to the Project, or that Petitioners had no
28 effective opportunity to raise such comments before the complained of actions were taken, or that

-14-
2696/034616-0001
12192320.3 a04/12/18 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT

n & Tucker, LLP

Petitioners were otherwise excused from or not obligated to raise such issues before pursuing them
2 in this action.

3 57. Pursuant to PRC § 21167.5, Petitioners have provided written notice of the
4 commencement of this action to Respondents.

58. Pursuant to PRC $ 21167.7 and CCP § 388, Petitioners have or will provide § written
6 notice of this action to the State Attorney General.

59. Petitioners brings this action pursuant to PRC §§ 21168 and 21168.5 and CCP
8 §8 1085 and 1094.5, which require that an agency's approval of a project be set aside if the agency

9 has prejudicially abused its discretion. Prejudicial abuse of discretion occurs where an agency fails

10 to proceed in the manner required by law, the decision is not supported by the findings, or the
11 findings are not supported by substantial evidence.
12 60. Pursuant to CCP §§ 1094.5 and/or 1085, a writ of mandate should issue directing
13 Respondents to rescind the Project Approvals, invalidating any and all purported approvals or
14 permits based on such inadequate CEQA review, and prohibiting Respondents from taking any
15 subsequent action to approve the Project, and restraining Developer and its agents from taking any
16 action to change or develop the Property, or make any physical alterations to the Property, unless
17 and until they have complied with CEQA, including, but not limited to, by preparing and circulating
18 an EIR for public review.

19 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

20 (Petition for Writ of Mandate for Violation of the State Planning & Zoning Law)

21 61. Petitioners hereby incorporate the allegations of the foregoing paragraphs as though

22 set forth in full herein by this reference.

23 62. State law requires that the Project be consistent with the Town's General Plan and
24 the JRSP. (Gov. Code §§ 65860, 65803, 65455.) While the Town is a charter city, it is has
25 nonetheless agreed to be bound by general state laws and adopted the consistency requirement in its
26 Municipal Code. (See, e.g., Town Charter, Article 4 and Truckee Development Code §§ 18.74.030,

27 18.78.040, 18.96.060.)

28 63. As a preliminary matter, the Town Council found that the Planning Commission's

-15-
2696/034616-0001
12192320.3 a04/12/18 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT

n & Tucker, LLP

approval of the Project was inconsistent with the JRSP. (Resolution 2018-15, p. 1; see also TC Staff
2 Report, pp. 2-3.) As such, the Planning Commission's approval of the Project was void. (Gov.
3 Code § 65455 and Lesher Communications, Inc. v. City of Walnut Creek (1990) 52 Cal.3d 531, 540,
4 544.) Because the Planning Commission's action was void, the Town Council lacked jurisdiction
5 to consider and subsequently act on the Appeal. (CCP § 1094.5(b).)

6 64. As set forth in the comments provided by Petitioners and others, the Project is
7 inconsistent with numerous planning goal and policies, as well as the "Vision Statement" set forth
8 in the Town's General Plan. For example, as outlined in its General Plan, the Town's key planning
9 objectives are to: (1) prevent sprawl by locating new development around existing developed areas;
10 (2) design commercial uses to accommodate projected demand and fulfill economic diversification
11  goals; (3) improve circulation by providing an enhanced road and trial network, fostering pedestrian-
12 oriented development, and encourage alternative modes of transportation; (4) promote mixed-use
13 development in commercial areas, including a mix of housing affordable to all sectors of the
14 community; and (5) ensure adequate provision of public services and infrastructure to support
15 planned residential and non-residential development in suitable locations. (General Plan, p. 1-7; see
16 also General Plan, pp. 1-8 and 2.2 to 2-3.) The Project does not achieve any of these objectives,
17 which are embodied in various plan goals and policies.3 Instead, it represents commercial sprawl,
18 would accommodate its demand through cannibalizing sales from existing stores, does not constitute
19 mixed-use development with affordable housing, and fails to provide adequate public services and
20 infrastructure, including key transportation improvements specified in the General Plan and JRSP.

21 65. Moreover, the approval of the Project, which will adversely impact Downtown and
22 other area commercial businesses and centers, is also inconsistent with numerous plan policies
23 requiring the Town to "[m]aintain and enhance Downtown as the heart of Truckee and as the Town's
24 premier tourist destination." (General Plan, Land Use Element, Policy P6.2; see also General Plan,
25 Community Character Element, Goal CC-6 ["Maintain Downtown as the pre-eminent Town center

26

27
3 (See, e.g., General Plan, Land Use Element, Goals LU-2, LU-3, LU-4; General Plan, Land Use 28 Element, Policies P1.1, P4.3, P5.4; General Plan, Community Character Element, Policy P9.3; JRSP,JR Goals 1, 4, 7, 8; JRSP, Policy P4.2.)

in Truckee, with a vibrant Main Street, mixture of uses, and rich diversity of historic resources"].)4
2 The General Plan specifically requires the Town to "[r]eview all proposed commercial projects
3  outside of Downtown for their potential to draw retail sales revenue away," and if so, to work to
"reconfigure projects so that they are complementary to, not competitive with, Downtown
commercial activity." (General Plan, Economic Development Element, Action A8.2; see also

6 General Plan, Land Use Element, Action A6.1 [requiring use of BAE Report to avoid competition
7 with significant new development Downtown]; and JRSP, p. 4.14 [discouraging retail chain stores

8 unless it can be demonstrated through an economic analysis that such a use will benefit the Town
as a whole and avoid or minimize economic impacts to Downtown].) Staff acknowledges that
10 "avoiding impacts to the Downtown is one of the fundamental principles of the Specific Plan." (PC
11 Staff Report, p. 17.)

12 66. As explained above, no unmet demand for grocery store remains. Any additional
13 grocery space, such as the proposed Raley's store, will be at the expense (and likely closure) of
14 existing grocery stores that will leave long-term vacancies in existing commercial centers. The BAE
15 Report specifically recommended that "additional detailed analysis" be performed if a full-sized
16 grocery store is planned for the JRSP area. (BAE Report, p. 20.) The Town not only ignored the
17 advice of its then expert consultant, it failed to adhere to the fundamental, mandatory, and clear
18 policies of its General Plan and the JRSP.

19 67. While the Project necessitates approximately 51 housing units, the Project was
20 conditioned to pay fees for 6.5 units, a fraction of the number needed. (Project Condition 22.)
21 Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that the amount of the fees is $503,620.5
22 It is entirely unclear how the Town credibly concluded that it could provide 6.5 housing units with
23 Developer's payment of $503,620. More fundamentally, neither these units nor the remaining units
24 may ever be built. JRSP, Policy P8.7 [development of workforce housing need only, but is not

26 4 (See also General Plan, Land Use Element, Goal LU-1, LU-6; General Plan, Community Character Element, Goal CC-7; General Plan, Community Character Element, Policies P6.5 and 27 P7.1; General Plan, Economic Development Element, Goal ED-8; General Plan, Economic

28 Development Element, Policy P8.5; JRSP, Policies P7.3, P7.4.) (But see TC Minutes, p. 9 [testimony of Alexis Ollar, Executive Director of Mountain Area Preservation, referring to the Developer only paying $250,000 in fees].)

required, to occur once 181,645 square feet of commercial development is approved].) The Project
2 thus conflicts with both the General Plan and JRSP which requires concurrent construction of
workforce housing. (General Plan, Housing Element, Goal H-1, Policy H-1.1, Programs H-1.2.4
4 and H-5.1.6, and pages HB-27 to HB-28; General Plan, Land Use Element, Policy PC3-P6; General
5 Plan, Community Character Element, Policy P9.3; JRSP, JR Goal 8; and Development Code,

6 Chapter 18.216.)

68. The JRSP requires Planned Development approval in conjunction with or prior to the
8 subdivision of any property within the CR zone. (JRSP, Development Standard CR-3.) The purpose
9 of this requirement "is to ensure that development of the entire zone is considered
10 comprehensively." Although the JRSP plainly required a comprehensive plan of the entire Property,

11 the Town allowed the Developer to only provide detailed plans for Phase of the Project. The
12 depiction of Parcel 3 as "Future Development-To Be Determined" does not satisfy the JRSP
13 requirement for a comprehensive plan of development and is undermined by Developer's plans to
14 improve this portion of the sitc with market rate housing.

15 69. The Town's General Plan and the JRSP require that development must provide
16 adequate public improvements and infrastructure in a timely mauner to accommodate needs and
17 impacts generated by the development activity. (General Plan, Goal LU-4; General Plan, Policies
18  P4.2 and P4.3; General Plan, Table LU-5.) The JRSP specifically requires that the first property
19 owner to develop and/or subdivide within the Project site is to "construct the improvements
20 identified on Figure 7-1" and outlined on pages 7.2 through 7.4 of the JRSP. These include
21 installation of bike paths in specified locations as well as certain water utility infrastructure. Yet,

22 as Staff acknowledged, the Project was excused from constructing the bike trail in certain specific
23 locations, e.g., to Hope Court and the trail connection to the Martis Valley Trail. Instead, and in
24 contradiction of the JRSP, this amenity is being deferred to "Phase II buildout," and thus may not
25 happen for years to come, if at all. The applicant is also being excused from constructing a 16
26 inch water main along Joerger Drive to the existing water main near Riverview Sports Park based
27 on an unspecified implementation and phasing plan reached with the Tahoe Donner Public Utility

28 District.

12192320.3 a04/12/18 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT

n & Tucker, LLP

70. The General Plan requires construction of a roundabout at the SR. 267/Brockway
2 Road/Soaring Way intersection. (General Plan, Circulation Element, Goals CIR-1 CIR-3, and CIR-
7; General Plan, Circulation Element, Policies P1.2, P3.3, and P7.1; General Plan, Table CIR-5 and
4 Figure CIR-3; General Plan, Circulation Element, Action A7.1.) Yet, in connection with granting

5 the Project Approvals, the Town Council found that this important improvement could be deferred

6 to some unspecified time in the future provided interim widening improvements are provided. This
7 directly contradicts General Plan Policy P7.1, as Staff previously acknowledged. (PC Staff Report,
8 p. 20 ["Note that while capacity enhancing improvements to the existing signalized intersection

9 would also improve the LOS to an acceptable level, this would not be consistent with Town policy
10 (General Plan Policy P7.1) which strives to replace existing traffic signals with roundabouts,
11 including traffic signals on State highways."].)

12 71. By approving a Project that is inconsistent with the Town's General Plan,
13 Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law and committed a prejudicial abuse of
14 discretion.

15 72. Pursuant to CCP §§ 1085 and/or 1094.5, a writ of mandate should issue directing
16 Respondents to rescind the Project Approvals, and prohibiting Respondents from approving any
17 project that is inconsistent with the Town's General Plan and/or JRSP, and restraining and enjoining
18 the Respondents and Real Parties from taking any action to implement the challenged Project
19 Approvals or to make any physical change to the Property.

20 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

21 (Violation of Town Development Code)

22 73. Petitioners hereby incorporate the allegations of the foregoing paragraphs as though
23 set forth in full herein by this reference.

24 74. In connection with its approval of the Project, the Town Council purported to strike
25 Condition 97 and to modify Condition 86. Nothing in Development Code § 18.140.030(E)(2)
26 authorizes the Town Council to unilaterally remove or modify conditions. Instead that section
27 makes clear that such action may only be taken if an appellant requests to eliminate or modify a
28 condition. The Appellants sought denial of the Project and did not ask that any conditions be

-19-
2696/034616-0001
12192320.3 a04/I2/18 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT

n & Tucker, LLP

1 eliminated or modified.

2 75. Further, the public notice provided by the Town for the Appeal did not adequately

3 describe the proposed removal of Condition 97 or the modification of Condition 86. The failure to
4 provide such notice violates the Planning & Zoning Law and the Town Development Code. (Gov.
Code $§ 65090, 65091, 65094; Development Code § 18.180.030.) The failure to afford interested
6 parties notice and an opportunity be heard on these key issues likewise constitutes a violation of
7 procedural due process. (Horn v. County of Ventura (1979) 24 Cal.3d 605, 616.)

8 76. In addition, the Town failed to comply with the requirements for granting variances
for the Project. In order to grant a variance from the standards set forth in the Town's Development
10 Code, the Town Council was required to make a number of specific findings. Specifically, the Town

11 was required to find that there are special circumstances applicable to the Property such that the
12 strict application of the Development Code deprives the property owner of privileges enjoyed by
13 other property owners in the vicinity and that the variance authorized does not constitute a grant of
14 special privileges inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the same zoning district.
15 (Development Code § 18.82.030(A); § see also Gov. § Code § 65906.) Contrary to the Planning &
16 Zoning Law and Development Code, the Town Council failed to make these findings. Moreover,
17 the findings that are made are not supported by substantial evidence, as required. (CCP § 1094.5(c);
18 Lucas Valley Homeowners Ass'n. v. County of Marin (1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 130, 142.)

19 77. By approving a Project that is inconsistent with the Town's Development Code,
20 Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law and committed a prejudicial abuse of
21 discretion.

22 78. Pursuant to CCP §§ 1085 and/or 1094.5, a writ of mandate should issue directing
23 Respondents to rescind the Project Approvals, and prohibiting Respondents from approving any
24 project that is inconsistent with the Town's Development Code, and restraining and enjoining the
25 Respondents and Real Parties from taking any action to implement the challenged Project Approvals
26 or to make any physical change to the Property.

FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Declaratory and Injunctive Relief)

79. Petitioners hereby incorporate the allegations of the foregoing paragraphs as though

4 set forth in full herein by this reference.

5 80. An actual controversy exists between Petitioners and Respondents and Real Parties
6 involving substantial questions regarding Respondents' approval of the Project. Petitioners

7 maintain that Respondents' approval of the Project violates state law, including CEQA, as well as

8 the Town's General Plan, JRSP, and Development Code, as described above.

9 81. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that Respondents and Real
10 Parties maintain the contrary. Accordingly, declaratory relief is appropriate and necessary to
11 determine Respondents' authority to approve the Project.

12 82. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that any implementation of
13 the Project Approvals by Respondents and Real Parties will cause irreparable and permanent harm

14 to Petitioners and be detrimental to the public at large as set forth above.

15 83. Petitioners have no adequate remedy at law to prevent or mitigate the imminent harm
16 and actions described above, have exhausted all available administrative remedies, and therefore
17 issuance of preliminary and permanent injunctive relief is necessary to restrain and enjoin
18 Respondents and Real Parties, and all others acting in concert with them from in any way seeking

19 to implement the Project Approvals and other actions, pending final resolution of this action.

20 84. To remedy Respondents' violations of law, as described above, Petitioners seek a
21 judicial declaration that Respondents' approval of the Project was invalid and contrary to law. Such
22 a declaration is a necessary and proper exercise of the Court's power to prevent future actions by
23 Respondents in violation of the law.

24 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

25 WHEREFORE, Petitioners respectfully pray for judgment as follows:

26 1. For a Writ of Mandate:

27 a. Directing Respondents to rescind, vacate and set aside Respondents' approval
28 of the Project, including each of the Project Approvals;

-21-
2696/034616-0001

1 & Tucker, LLP

b. Commanding Respondents and Real Parties to refrain from taking any further
2 actions in furtherance or implementation of the Project, including but not limited to: (i) the issuance
or approval of any site plans, grading permits, or building permits, and (ii) any construction in
4 furtherance of any development associated with the Project; and

C. Commanding Respondents to prepare a draft environmental impact report

6 and circulate it for public review and comment, consistent with the requirements of CEQA, and to
7 comply with all other requirements of CEQA, prior to taking any subsequent action to approve the
8 Project;

9 2. For the declaratory relief requested above;

10 3. For a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction ordering the
11 Respondents and Real Parties to refrain from proceeding with the Project, taking any action to
12 change or develop the Property, or making any physical alterations to the Property, while this action
13 is pending;

14 4. For a permanent injunction ordering the Respondents and Real Parties to refrain from
15 proceeding with the Project pending Respondents' full compliance with the procedural mandates of
16 the law;

17 5. For an award of attorney's fees, litigation expenses, and costs as permitted or
18 required by law, including but not limited to CCP § 1021.5, Government Code §§ § 800, 54960.5, and

PROOF OF SERVICE

3 STATE OF CALIFORNIA, COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA

I am employed by the law office of Rutan & Tucker, LLP in the County of Santa Clara, State of California. I am over the age of 18 and not a party to the within action. My business 5 address is Five Palo Alto Square, 3000 El Camino Real, Suite 200, Palo Alto, CA 94306-9814.

7 On April 13, 2018, I served on the interested parties in said action the within:
NOTICE TO ATTORNEY GENERAL

8  as stated below:

o California State Office of the Attorney General

10 Honorable Xavier Becerra 1300 "I" Street, 11th Floor

11 Sacramento, CA 95814-2919

12 xX (BY MAIL) by placing a true copy thereof in sealed envelope(s) addressed as shown above.

13 In the course of my employment with Rutan & Tucker, LLP, I have, through first-hand personal observation, become readily familiar with Rutan & Tucker, LLP's practice of collection 14 and processing correspondence for mailing with the United States Postal Service. Under that practice, I deposited such envelope(s) in an out-box for collection by other personnel of Rutan & 15 Tucker, LLP, and for ultimate posting and placement with the U.S. Postal Service on that same day in the ordinary course of business. If the customary business practices of Rutan & Tucker, 16 LLP with regard to collection and processing of correspondence and mailing were followed, and ] am confident that they were, such envelope(s) were posted and placed in the United States mail at 17 Palo Alto, California, that same date. I am aware that on motion of party served, service is presumed invalid if postal cancellation date or postage meter date is more than one day after date 18 of deposit for mailing in affidavit.

19 Executed on April 13, 2018, at Palo Alto, California.

20

21 I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the foregoing is true and correct.
