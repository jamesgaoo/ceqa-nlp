25 1. By this action, Petitioners East Yard Communities for Environmental Justice and

6 Agreement 2013-1 "Scope of Development," "Conditions of Approval," "Development

7 Standards" or "List of Permitted Uses," or the Calfornia Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA")

8 for the Site.

JURISDICTION

10 2. This Court has jurisdiction under Code. Civ. Proc. § 1085 (mandamus actions).

11 The parties and the Project Site are located in the County of Los Angeles. A notice of intent to

12 sue was mail served January 19, 2018 and is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

13 PARTIES

14 3. Petitioner East Yard Communities for Environmental Justice ("East Yard") is

15 non-profit corporation located at 2317 Atlantic BI., Commerce CA 90040 whose members

16 include affected individuals who have a beneficial interest in the matters set forth in this Petition.

17 Petitioner's mission is to ensure environmentally sustainable development in the I-710 corridor

18 and informed decisionmaking by public officials with regard to consistency with development

19 plans for the Site. East Yard sent a letter dated January 13, 2018 to the City raising concerns

20 about the issues herein. Petitioner Lopez is a member.

21 4. Petitioner Mark Lopez frequents the location, the intersections at and in the

22 vicinity of the Project almost daily, and will be affected by the Respondents' failure to follow the

23 substantive and procedural requirements of the City's zoning laws, including but not limited to

24 the governing Development Agreement 2013-1 "Scope of Development," "Conditions of

25 Approval," "Development Standards" or "List of Permitted Uses." He wrote the letter dated

26 January 13, 2018 to the City raising concerns about the issues herein. His interests will continue

27

28 -2-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

to be directly affected by the Project until Respondents comply with all governing laws in

2 connection with the Project.

3 5. Respondent City of Bell and its Public Finance Authority is California municipal
corporation chartered under the Constitution and laws of the State of California and located in the

5 County of Los Angeles, California that permits the Project and enforces the governing

6 Development Agreement 2013-1 "Scope of Development," "Conditions of Approval,"

7 "Development Standards" or "List of Permitted Uses" and EIR for the Site.

8 6. Real Parties PI BELL, LLC; PI BELL PARCEL I, LLC; PI BELL PARCEL II,

9 LLC; PI BELL PARCEL III, LLC; PI BELL PARCEL IV, LLC; PI BELL PARCEL V, LLC are

10 Delaware limited liability companies believed to be the Project applicant and recipient of the

11 Development Agreement 2013-1 "Scope of Development," "Conditions of Approval,"

12 "Development Standards" or "List of Permitted Uses."

13 7. Real Party in Interest PD Development, Inc. is a California company believed to

14 be the lessee of the Site and building the Project.

15 8. Real Party in Interest CEMEX, Inc. is a Louisiana company believed to be the

16 lessee of the Site and building the Project.

17 9. The true names, capacities, corporate, associate or otherwise of Respondents and

18 Real Parties named herein as DOES 1 through 10, inclusive, are unknown to Petitioners who,

19 therefore, sue said Respondents and Real Parties by fictitious names. Petitioners will amend this

20 Petition to show the true names and capacities when they have been ascertained.

21 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

22 10. Petitioners have a long history of working towards environmentally sustainable

23 development at this specific Site, including successful CEQA litigation against the City and

24 BNSF in 2008. East Yard Communities v. Bell Public Financing Authority, LASC Case No.

25 BS111726. East Yard also participated extensively in the "Bell Business Center" environmental

26 impact report ("EIR" SCH # 2013041035) process for the Site in 2013.

27

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

L 11.

2 On November 30, 2017, pursuant to their November 13, 2017 Public Records Act
request, Petitioners were provided documents about the

3 proposed Project at the site and upon

4 review discovered for the first time that it appears to be an open-air, heavy-duty belt conveyor

5 ready mix terminal/plant for rock, sand, dirt, and gravel unloaded by the rail spur at the site.

6 Project Approvals include multiple building permits including but not limited to those issued
October and November 2017, and including up to the present.
7 12.

8 Then, in December 2017 Angelo Logan, a member of East Yard, met with City

9 staff to express concerns that the Project conflicts with the EIR and applicable Site Development

10 Standards for the site. City staff explained that there were no hearings or public notice provided

11 for the Project, which the staff believe substantially conforms to the EIR, the Development

12 Agreement 2013-1 "Scope of Development," "Conditions of Approval," "Development

13 Standards" or "List of Permitted Uses" and other governing land use conditions. Also no CEQA
Notice of Determination was filed for the Project Approvals.
14 13.

15 After speaking with City staff, who provided sparse substantive explanation or

16 analysis, Petitioners respectfully remain unpersuaded that the Project complies with the EIR, its

17 mitigation program, the applicable Development Agreement 2013-1 "Scope of Development,"
"Conditions of Approval," "Development Standards" or "List of Permitted Uses."

18 14.

19 The Site EIR states "the intent of the proposed project is to construct sufficient

20 building areä to allow all uses to be conducted in an enclosed building" (p. 3.9-9). In fact, all

21 proposed Site plans in the EIR show a covered building at the Site. Nothing like this Project was
ever contemplated or studied for the site.

22 15. Moreover, the governing Development Agreement 2013-1 "Scope of
23 Development," "Conditions of Approval," "Development Standards" or "List of Permitted Uses"
24

25 state that "[g]round mounted machinery and utilities shall be enclosed." This Project from what

26 Petitioners have recently learned violates that condition. This position is also supported by the

27 project Development Agreement with Section 4.3 that states that any zoning inconsistency in the

28 zoning documents is governed first by the EIR. Petitioners believe that there are a host of other

-4.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

zoning conditions from the governing Development Agreement 2013-1 "Scope of Development,"

2 "Conditions of Approval," "Development Standards" or "List of Permitted Uses" and EIR

3 mitigation monitoring and reporting program ("MMRP") that likely cannot be satisfied for an

4 open-air ready mix terminal project. This Project will have aesthetic, hydrology, air quality, land

5 use impacts, etc. not analyzed in the EIR.

6 16. Petitioners also believe that the Project was approved without compliance with

7 procedural requirements of the governing Development Agreement 2013-1 "Scope of

8 Development," "Conditions of Approval," "Development Standards" or "List of Permitted Uses"

9 including approval of design plans by a Design Review Board with a more transparent public

10 process involving elected and appointed official(s) that would have given Petitioners sooner

11 notice of this Pröject.

12 17. Petitioners understand that gravel and concrete are needed for economic growth in

13 our region. And that they can be transported and stored in many cases in environmentally

14 sensitive ways. However, it is Petitioners' current position that this open-air ready mix terminal

15 Project does not comply with the governing environmental and land use conditions or procedures

16 for this site.

17 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

18 (Writ of Mandate and Declaratory Relief- Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1060 and 1085 Violations of Applicable Land Use Laws)
19 18. Petitioners restate and reallege Paragraphs 1-17 as if fully set forth herein.
20 19. While cities enjoy some discretion interpreting their zoning laws, "deference has
21 limits" and courts are not bound by unreasonable interpretations contrary to the plain language of
22 regulations and statutes. Orange Citizens for Parks & Recreation v. Superior Court (2016) 2
23 Cal.5th 141, 146, 156-157 (rejecting attempts to "downplay the facial inconsistency," Court held
24 city abused its discretion finding residential project consistent with general plan designation
25 where "no reasonable person could conclude that the Property could be developed without a
26 general plan amendment"); see also Stolman, 114 Cal.App.4th at 928-930 (vacating variance
27 based on zoning administrator's interpretation contradicted by language of the municipal code).
28 -5-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- 20. Here, Petitioners are informed and believe that granting the Project Approvals
N constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion by Respondents by failing to proceed in the manner

3 required by law as required under the governing Development Agreement 2013-1 "Scope of

4 Development," "Conditions of Approval," "Development Standards" or "List of Permitted Uses."

5 This Project does not substantially conform to the governing Development Agreement 2013-1

6 "Scope of Development," "Conditions of Approval," "Development Standards" or "List of

7 Permitted Uses." The violations include but are not limited to Respondents' failure to follow the

8 procedural requirements and exceeding the exercise of power granted to staff in the governing

9 Development Agreement 2013-1 "Scope of Development," "Conditions of Approval,"

10 "Development Standards" or "List of Permitted Uses" by issuing the Approvals unlawfully by

11 City staff withöut prior proper Design Review Board consent under the Cal. Gov. Code and City

12 Municipal Code.

13 21. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law other than the relief

14 sought in this Petition. If the Real Parties are not enjoined or stayed from undertaking acts in

15 furtherance of the Project, Petitioners and the public will suffer irreparable harm from which there|

16 is no adequate remedy at law in that the Project will be built, operations commence and

17 significant adverse impacts that would occur, contrary to State and local law. Petitioners request

18 a judicial determination of the parties' rights and duties, and the meaning of the terms of the

19 governing Development Agreement 2013-1 "Scope of Development," "Conditions of Approval,"

20 "Development Standards" or "List of Permitted Uses."

21 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

22 (Writ of Mandate Mandamus - Code Civ. Proc. § 1085
Violations of CEQA)
23 22. Petitioners restate and reallege Paragraphs 1-21 as if fully set forth herein.
24 23. The Project Approvals violate the EIR and MMRP for the Bell Business Center.
25 This is a different project than described and studied in the EIR. All proposed site plans in the
26 EIR show a covered building at the site. Nothing like this Project was ever described or studied
27 for the site. This Project will have aesthetic, hydrology, air quality, land use impacts, etc. not
28 -6-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 analyzed in the EIR. Furthermore, the MMRP is not being enforced or implemented for this

2 Project with regard to mitigations for air quality, climate/greenhouse gas, noise, or transportation.

3 Each new day of failure to enforce the MMRP is a continuing violation.
4 24. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law other than the relief

5 sought in this Petition. If the Real Parties are not enjoined or stayed from undertaking acts in

6 furtherance of the Project, Petitioners and the public will suffer irreparable harm from which there
7 is no adequate remedy at law in that the Project will be built, operations commence and

8 significant adverse impacts that would occur, contrary to State and local law.
9 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

10 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for the following relief:
11 25. That the Court enter a peremptory writ of mandate ordering Respondents including
12 all agents thereof, to set aside and void the Project Approvals for the Project pending
13 Respondents' full compliance with governing law - including but not limited to the EIR,
14 MMRP, and Development Agreement 2013-1 "Scope of Development," "Conditions of
15 Approval," "Development Standards" or "List of Permitted Uses."
16 26. That the Court issue a temporary stay, stay, temporary restraining order, and/or
17 injunction ordering the Respondents, Real Parties, and their agents and successors to refrain
18 from proceeding with the Project and issuing further permits while this Petition is pending;
19 27. That the Court issue a permanent injunction ordering the Respondents and Real
20 Parties to refrain from proceeding with the Project pending the Respondents' full compliance
21 with governing law.
22 28. For Petitioners' costs and fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure; and
23 29. For other and further relief as the Court finds proper.

RE: CEMEX Project, 5091 Rickenbacker Rd. Bell, CA NOTICE OF INTENT TO SUE
Dear Mayor, Clerk, City Manager and City Engineer:

On behalf of East Yard Communities for Environmental Justice, to challenge the referenced CEMEX project in the City of Bell. respectfully am submitting this second letter
We wrote on January 13, 2018 requesting a meeting by January 18, 2018 but got no response at all. Let this letter notify you under Pub. Res. Code 21167.5 that East Yard and I therefore intend to sue the City and its Public Financing Authority for failure to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act in connection with the project.
The project fails to comply with the Bell Business Center" environmental impaci report ("EIR" SCH # 2013041035), its mitigation monitoring reporting program ("MMRP"), the applicable Site Development Standards or land use conditions. The EIR clearly states "Ihe intent of the proposed project is to construct sufficient building area to allow all uses to be conducted in an enclosed building" (p. 3.9-9). In fact, all proposed site plans in the EIR show a covered building at the site. Nothing like this project was ever contemplated or studied for the site. Moreover, the applicable Site Development Standards clearly state that "[g]round mounted machinery and utilities shall be enclosed." This project from whal we have recently. learned plainly yiolates that condition. Our position is also supported by the project Development Agreement with PI Bell, LLC Section 4.3 that states that any zoning inconsistency in the documents is governed the first by EIR. This project will have aesthetic, hydrology, air quality, land use impacts, etc. not analyzed in the EIR. Furthermore, the MMRP is not being enforced or implemented for this Project with air quality, climate/greenhouse gas, noise, or transportation. Each new day regard to mitigations for of failure to enforce the MMRP is a continuing violation.
The lawsuit will seek a writ of mandate and injunctive relief, as well as other relief that the Superior Court deems proper.
