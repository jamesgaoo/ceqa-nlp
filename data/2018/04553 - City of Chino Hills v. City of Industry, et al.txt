FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

In support of its First Amended Verified Petition for Peremptory Writ of
2 | Mandate (the "Petition"), petitioner City of Chino Hills ("Chino Hills") alleges as follows:

4 INTRODUCTION

1. This action concerns three distinct public agencies, generally

6 controlled by the same operatives, who in their zeal to develop a large solar project and
7| rake in many millions of dollars for the City of Industry ('"Industry") and a bevy of hired
8 consultants, have trampled on State laws that require them to conduct environmental

9 reviews prior to approving projects, to make their decisions at public meetings with proper
10 notice, and sell property at fair market value, and that restrict the purposes for which
11 municipalities may acquire and lease land located outside of their geographic boundaries.

12 2. At the center of this action is Tres Hermanos Ranch ("Tres

13 Hermanos"), which includes approximately 2,445 acres of largely undeveloped land that
14. has historically been used-for ranching, farming and-cattle grazing. The-Industry-Urban--
15 Development Agency (the "Industry Redevelopment Agency"), which was a

16 redevelopment agency established in Industry, acquired Tres Hermanos in 1978, but the
17 property was transferred in 2012 to the Successor Agency to the Industry Urban-
18 Development Agency (the "Successor Agency") after the Industry Redevelopment
19 Agency, and all other redevelopment agencies in California, were dissolved in 2011
20 pursuant to State legislation known as the Redevelopment Dissolution Act.

21 3. The Redevelopment Dissolution Act created "successor agencies" that
22 are charged with winding down the affairs of the former redevelopment agencies,
23 including the disposal of all their real property and other assets. The actions of the
24 successor agencies are subject to review and approval by "oversight boards," established
25 by the Redevelopment Dissolution Act, to act as fiduciaries to "taxing entities." Taxing
26 entities consist of the various local agencies that receive a pro rata share of the property
27 taxes assessed against the former redevelopment agency's properties. They include school
28 districts, fire districts, cities and counties. As part of the process of disposing of real
-3- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1

1 property, successor agencies are required to develop long range property management
2 plans designed to sell properties expeditiously and in a manner that maximizes their
3 value. Once such a plan is approved by the California Department of Finance ("DOF"),

4 the successor agency must dispose of real property pursuant to that plan. Acting in its
5 capacity as a fiduciary to the taxing entities, the oversight board reviews the successor

6 agency's approval of any proposed sale of real estate to ensure consistency with the long
7 range property management plan. Proceeds from the sale of the property are then
8 distributed to the taxing entities based upon their relative pro rata shares of the property
9 taxes assessed against the property.
10 4. Approximately 695 acres of Tres Hermanos are located within the
11 boundaries of the City of Diamond Bar ("Diamond Bar") and the County of Los Angeles
12 ("LA County"), while the other approximately 1,750 acres are located within the
13 boundaries of Chino Hills and the County of San Bernardino ("SB County"). Therefore,
.14  Diamond Bar and Chino Hills are among the "taxing entities" that are entitled to receive_
15 portions the real property taxes assessed for Tres Hermanos, as well as portions of the
16| proceeds from the sale of Tres Hermanos by the Successor Agency.
17 5. In 2014, DOF approved a Long-Range Property Management Plan
18 (the "LRPMP") prepared by the Successor Agency that governs the Successor Agency's
19 disposal of the real property previously owned by the Industry Redevelopment Agency.
20 The LRPMP states that the "current estimated value" of Tres Hermanos was approximately
21 $85-122 million as of April 2013.

22 6. In 2015, Industry decided that it wanted to purchase Tres Hermanos.
23 It was, of course, negotiating with itself to acquire the property because the Successor
24 Agency is governed by a Board of Directors (the "Successor Agency Board") comprised of
25 the five members of the Industry City Council (the "City Council"). Throughout most of
26 the process, Industry's "negotiators" for the sale have been Paul Philips, who is the
27 Industry City Manager, and James Casso, who is the Industry City Attorney, while the
28 Successor Agency's "negotiators" have been Paul Philips, who is also the Executive
-4- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Director of the Successor Agency, and James Casso, who is also the Successor Agency's
2 legal counsel.

3 7. In September 2016, the Successor Agency tried to sell Tres Hermanos
4 to Industry for only $41.65 million, notwithstanding the $85-122 million estimated value
5 in the LRPMP and that the Successor Agency had received a detailed and credible offer of
6 $101 million from a residential developer. The $41.65 million purchase price was based
7 on a deeply flawed appraisal, which determined that the value of Tres Hermanos was
8 $41.65 million based on a "hypothetical condition" that the use of the property would be
9 restricted to open space. On September 8, 2016, both the City Council and the Successor
10 Agency Board approved a purchase agreement with the $41.65 million purchase price.
11 8. However, on September 29, 2016, the Oversight Board of the
12 Successor Agency (the "Oversight Board"), which oversees the Successor Agency,
13 rejected the Successor Agency Board's approval of the $41.65 million purchase agreement
14 and requested that the Successor Agency obtain a new appraisal based on the highest and
15 best use of Tres Hermanos, consistent with the current land use and zoning designations
16 for the property.

17 9. In December 2016, the Successor Agency obtained a second
18 appraisal, which determined that the fair market value of Tres Hermanos was
19 $100 million, based on the highest and best use of limited residential development. In
20 January 2017, the City Council and the Successor Agency Board approved a revised
21 purchase agreement for the sale of Tres Hermanos with a purchase price of $100 million.
22 However, they did so without conducting any environmental review pursuant to the
23 California Environmental Quality Act (California Public Resources Code §§ 21000
24 et seq., "CEQA"), claiming that the project was exempt from CEQA review under the
25 "common sense" exemption in Section 15061(b)(3) of the State CEQA Guidelines, which
26 only applies "where it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility that the activity
27| in question may have a significant effect on the environment."
28

-5- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETTTION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

10. The Successor Agency Board's approval of the $100 million purchase
2 agreement was scheduled for review and approval by the Oversight Board at its August 24,
3 2017 meeting. However, the Oversight Board never took action on that agreement.

4 Instead, Mr. Philips, who is also a member of the Oversight Board, made a motion,
5 following public testimony, to approve a purchase and sale agreement with a
6 $41.65 million purchase price, subject to the Oversight Board's imposition of a restrictive
7 covenant that limited the use of Tres Hermanos to "open space, public use or preservation"
8| (the "Final Tres Hermanos PSA"). The Oversight Board narrowly approved the motion by
9 a 4-3 vote. It did so without conducting, or requiring the Successor Agency to conduct,
10 any environmental review pursuant to CEQA. The Oversight Board did not provide any
11 opportunity to the public to comment on this sudden turn of events and the public notice
12 for the hearing did not describe the $41.65 million purchase price (or any purchase price at
13 all) or the restrictive covenant.

14 11.This was little more than_a.shell game by Industry, the Successor
15 Agency and the Oversight Board. The $41.65 million appraisal assumed that Tres
16 Hermanos would remain open space in perpetuity. The restrictive covenant, however, also
17 allows "public uses." Therefore, the $41.65 million appraisal does not support a sale that
18 allows public uses. The restrictive covenant is also illusory because, under current State
19 law, a city can only acquire real property outside its boundaries for municipal use, and
20 Industry had offered $100 million fully cognizant of that limitation.
21 12. After the Oversight Board's surprise approval of the Final Tres
22 Hermanos PSA, with its $41.65 million purchase price and the related restrictive covenant,
23 the Successor Agency Board and the Industry City Council approved the Final Tres
24 Hermanos PSA on September 28, 2017.
25 13. What is really going on here? The answer is that, for about two years,
26 Industry has covertly been working with a developer and large teams of consultants and
27 lawyers to develop a major solar facility on Tres Hermanos and, potentially, on adjacent
28 tracts of land that it owns. In May 2016, it purported to approve master ground lease a

-6- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

- with San Gabriel Valley Water and Power, LLC ("San Gabriel WP") for the development
2 of a photovoltaic solar project with an aggregate of 450 megawatts of rated annual
3 output on Tres Hermanos and adjacent land parcels, from which Industry would receive
4 significant financial benefit. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon alleges,

5 that (a) neither the master ground lease nor any of the four lease amendments thereto
(collectively, the "Master Lease") were approved by the City Council in open session at a 6

7 public meeting and (b) instead, all discussions and approvals, if any, regarding the Master

8 Lease occurred in closed session and without the public's knowledge. The Master Lease
9 requires Industry to reimburse San Gabriel WP for up to $20 million in expenses relating
10 to the development of the solar project.

11 14. Around the time the original master ground lease was executed, San
12 Gabriel WP and Industry put their consultant/legal teams to work to develop the solar
13 project. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that based on
14 L documents Diamond Bar and Chino Hills received in response to Public Records Act
15 requests, (a) Industry has received invoices from San Gabriel WP that, at a minimum, total a

16 almost $9 million for work performed by its consultant/legal team from April 2016-April
17 2017 with respect to the solar project, and that those aggregate reimbursable expenses have
18 increased considerably since April 2017, and (b) Industry has paid its own consultant/legal

19 team a minimum of almost $4 million. At a recent City Council meeting, Newell Ruggles,
20 one of the Industry Councilmembers, stated in frustration that Industry's total expenditures

21 were $20 million and that the City Council was "being kept in the dark by city staff" and
22  "hadn't seen anything" relating to the solar project.

23 15. Industry and the Successor Agency representatives have done all they
24 possibly can to conceal the existence of the solar project and all documentation relating to
25 it. To date, notwithstanding repeated Public Records Act requests for all documents
26 relating to the solar project, neither Diamond Bar nor Chino Hills has received any of the
27 plans, studies or environmental documents for which Industry has already paid millions of
28 dollars. Industry representatives, in particular Mr. Philips and Mr. Casso, have repeatedly
-7- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 and disingenuously stated at public meetings that, despite the execution of the Master
2 Lease and the enormous expenditures over an extended period (which they almost never
3 publicly acknowledge), Industry still has no development plan or documentation
4 whatsoever that it can share with the public, or apparently with some members of its own
5 City Council, regarding the planned solar project.

6 16. Against this covert background, Mr. Philips proposed the
7 $41.65 million purchase price, subject to the illusory "public use" restriction, so that
8 Industry could attempt to characterize the planned solar project as a public use and reap
significantly greater profit. The restrictive covenant would allow Industry to artificially
10| and significantly reduce the purchase price by almost $60 million, based on a
11 "hypothetical" open space use, even as it moves aggressively forward with the
12 development of the major solar facility on Tres Hermanos that might well justify a
13 purchase price in excess of $100 million. This scheme would effectively transfer at least
14  approximately $60 million from.Diamond Bar, Chino Hills and the other taxing entities,
15 which are entitled to share the proceeds from the sale, to Industry (which is not a taxing
16 entity because Tres Hermanos is located outside of Industry's boundaries). It would also
17 significantly reduce the real property taxes that would otherwise be assessed for Tres
18 Hermanos following the sale, to the further detriment of the taxing entities. Nonetheless,
19 four members of the Oversight Board went along with it, and in so doing the Oversight
20 Board breached its statutory fiduciary responsibility to Chino Hills and the other taxing
21 entities.

22 17. And what does Industry intend to do with its $60 million windfall?
23 On this subject, Mr. Philips was quite candid at the Oversight Board meeting on August
24 24: "Frankly, there's more cash to put into the [solar] project." He then characterized this
25 as a primary "justification" for the $41.65 million purchase price.
26 18. Relatedly, Diamond Bar notified the Industry City Council on
27 September 27, 2017 that it had unlawfully approved the Master Lease, in violation of the
28 Brown Act, because none of the documents comprising the Master Lease had been
-8- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

approved by the City Council in open session at a public meeting. In response, on October
2 12, 2017, the City Council "ratified" the Master Lease.

3 19. The City Council's approval of the Master Lease and the approval by

4 the City Council, the Successor Agency Board and the Oversight Board of the Final Tres

5 Hermanos PSA violated the law in numerous respects. Those violations, as more

6 particularly pled below, include the following:

a. Industry and the City Council failed to carry out environmental
8 review under CEQA or certify or adopt a CEQA document with respect to the Master
9 Lease prior to the City Council's approval of the Master Lease.

10 b. The Successor Agency, the Successor Agency Board and the
11 Oversight Board failed to carry out environmental review under CEQA or certify or adopt
12 a CEQA document with respect to the Final Tres Hermanos PSA prior to the approval of
13 the Final Tres Hermanos PSA by the Oversight Board and the Successor Agency Board.
14 Industry and the City Council failed to carry out environmental_
15 review under CEQA or certify or adopt a CEQA document with respect to the Final Tres
16 Hermanos PSA prior to the City Council's approval of the Final Tres Hermanos PSA.

17 d. Industry failed to comply with the requirements of
18 Section 65402(b) of the California Government Code, which required general plan
19 conformity review by the Diamond Bar and Chino Hills Planning Commissions prior to
20 the City Council's approval of the Final Tres Hermanos PSA.
21 e. The sale of Tres Hermanos for $41.65 million, far below its
22 fair market value, constituted a gift of public funds because it effectively transferred at
23 least almost $60 million in revenue from Diamond Bar, Chino Hills and the other taxing
24 entities to Industry sO that Industry could use those funds for its planned solar project.
25 f. The Oversight Board violated federal procedural due process
26 rights under the United States Constitution because (i) the public notice and agenda
27 materials for the August 24, 2017 hearing at which the Oversight Board approved the Final
28 Tres Hermanos PSA did not provide any notice of the $41.65 million purchase price and
-9- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

the related restrictive covenant and (ii) the public had no opportunity to provide written or
2 oral comments regarding the Final Tres Hermanos PSA.

3 g. The Oversight Board violated the procedural due process rights

4 under the California Constitution because (i) the public notice and agenda materials for the
5 August 24, 2017 hearing at which the Oversight Board approved the Final Tres Hermanos
6 PSA did not provide any notice of the $41.65 million purchase price and the related
7 restrictive covenant and (ii) the public had no opportunity to provide written or oral
8 comments regarding the Final Tres Hermanos PSA.

9 h. The City Council's approval of the $100 Million Tres
10 Hermanos PSA, the Final Tres Hermanos PSA and the Master Lease violated
11 Section 37351 of the California Government Code because Industry's acquisition of Tres
12 Hermanos and its lease of the property to San Gabriel WP are intended for the
13 development and operation of a major solar facility that would generate energy far
14 exceeding Industry's needs and generate millions of dollars in revenue for San Gabriel WP.
15 a private entity, Industry (which already has general fund reserves of approximately $623
16 million and overall reserves of approximately $1.5 billion) and their respective consultants,
17 and therefore is not necessary or proper for municipal purposes.

18 i. The City Council's approval of the $100 Million Tres
19 Hermanos PSA, the Final Tres Hermanos PSA and the Master Lease violated
20 Section 10004 of the California Public Utilities Code because the planned solar project
21 would produce energy far beyond the needs of Industry and its inhabitants.

19 TRES HERMANOS

20 28. On February 3, 1978, Industry acquired Tres Hermanos for
21 $12.1 million. The property consists of approximately 2,445 acres of largely undeveloped
22 land. In November 1978, Industry transferred ownership of Tres Hermanos to the Industry
23 Redevelopment Agency.

24 29. Approximately 695 acres of Tres Hermanos are located within the
25 boundaries of Diamond Bar and, therefore, within the boundaries of LA County, and
26 include Assessor Parcel Nos. 8701-021-271, 8701-022-270 and 8701-022-273. The other
27 approximately 1,750 acres are located within the boundaries of Chino Hills and, therefore,
28 within the boundaries of SB County, and include Assessor Parcel Nos. 1000-011-019,

PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 1000-011-020, 1000-011-021, 1000-11-022, 1000-021-013, 1000-021-014, 1000-031-014
2 and 1000-031-15. The current general plan land use and zoning designations established

3 for Tres Hermanos by Diamond Bar and Chino Hills allow limited residential development

4 and open space uses.

5 30. For almost 40 years, Tres Hermanos has remained primarily open
6 space and the Industry Redevelopment Agency and its successor in interest, the Successor
7 Agency, have leased Tres Hermanos to tenants for cattle grazing, one of its historic uses.

8 31. In the 1970s and 1980s, Industry and the Industry Redevelopment
9 Agency caused the preparation of a variety of preliminary studies for the development of a
10 modest reservoir/dam or a residential community on Tres Hermanos. Later, in July 2000,
11 they began to explore potential large-scale reservoir/dam on a larger parcel of land that
12 included Tres Hermanos and approximately 2,400 acres of the adjacent Firestone Scout
13 Reservation (the "2.400-Acre Firestone Property") that the City subsequently acquired
-14-from-the-Boy-Scouts of-America, Los Angeles-Area Council (the "Boy Scouts"), in-June
15 2001 and still owns.

17 THE SUCCESSOR AGENCY, THE LONG-RANGE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT

18 PLAN AND THE OVERSIGHT BOARD

19 32. Pursuant to Assembly Bill X1 26 (as amended, the "Redevelopment
20 Dissolution Act"), which became effective in June 2011, the Industry Redevelopment
21 Agency and all other redevelopment agencies in California were dissolved. The
22 Redevelopment Dissolution Act added HSC Sections 34179-34191.6, which, among other
23 things, (a) provide for the creation of successor agencies to succeed to the authority, rights,
24 powers, duties and obligation of the former redevelopment agencies, and set forth
25 procedures, requirements and standards regarding the governance of successor agencies,
26 and (b) require the establishment of an oversight board with respect to each successor
27 agency to oversee the activities of the successor agency, and set forth procedures,
28 requirements and standards for the governance of oversight boards.
-13- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

33. In September 2011, the Successor Agency was established as the
2 successor agency to the Industry Redevelopment Agency. In February 2012, the Industry
3 City Council, acting as the governing board for the Successor Agency, established rules
4 and regulations for the governance and operation of the Successor Agency and, pursuant to
5 that resolution, provided that the Successor Agency would be governed by a Board of
6 Directors consisting of the members of the City Council (previously defined as the
7 "Successor Agency Board").

8 34. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that in or

0 around September 2011, the Oversight Board was established to oversee the activities of
10 the Successor Agency.

11 35. In July 2012, fee title to Tres Hermanos was transferred from the
12 Industry Redevelopment Agency to the Successor Agency, as required by the
13 Redevelopment Dissolution Act.
36. n.May 2013, DOE granted a "finding of completion" for the
15 Successor Agency in accordance with HSC Section 34179.7.

16 37. In order to dispose of the real estate assets of the former Industry
17 Redevelopment Agency, the Successor Agency was required to prepare a long-range
18 property management plan, for approval by the Oversight Board and DOF, pursuant to
19 HSC Section 34191.5: That plan was required to include an estimate of the current value
20 of each parcel, including, if available, appraisal information.
21 38. On October 8, 2013, the Oversight Board approved the Long-Range
22 Property Management Plan (previously defined as the "LRPMP") prepared by the
23 Successor Agency. In the LRPMP, Tres Hermanos is identified as "Property 68." The
24 LRPMP includes the following information and statements relating to Tres Hermanos:
25 a. The "current estimated value" of Tres Hermanos as of April
26 2013 was approximately $85-122 million, based on a "preliminary by Keyser Marston," an
27 economic consulting firm.
28

-14- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 b. Tres Hermanos is one of the "properties to be marketed
2 through direct contact with interested parties and through the use of brokers. Proposals
3 would be evaluated based upon acceptable development plans."

4 C. As one of the properties made available for sale, Tres

5 Hermanos

6 would have to meet the basic criteria of agreement to pay a

7 reasonable price based on a current appraisal and submission of
a Development Plan and Schedule acceptable to the City. The
8 properties would be distributed to brokers and interested parties.
Competing proposals would be evaluated based upon the following criteria to determine which prospective buyer to work with on
10 finalizing a project to forward to the Successor Agency and
Oversight Board for approval.
11 - Agreement to pay a reasonable price based upon a current

12 appraisal
- A development Plan and schedule through construction acceptable
13 to the City An estimate of the assessed value of the project
-Identification-of the end user, the job-creation-and if-the-user-is-a
15 local company - Identification of the type of intended tenants if the project is
16 speculative. (Emphasis added.)

17 d. Successor Agency "staff recommends the property be offered

18 for sale to the City and if the City has no interest in acquiring the property would be made
19 generally available for sale."

20 39. The Successor Agency submitted that LRPMP to DOF for approval.
21 However, DOF required revisions to the LRPMP. On February 6, 2014, the Oversight
22 Board approved a revised version of the LRPMP prepared by the Successor Agency.
23 However, none of those revisions related to Tres Hermanos.

24 40. In a February 21, 2014 letter (the "2/21/14 DOF Approval Letter")
25 from Justyn Howard of DOF to Kevin Radecki, then the Industry City Manager, DOF
26 approved the revised LRPMP. The letter stated that the LRPMP governs the disposition of

27 all real property assets of the Industry Redevelopment Agency. It further stated that "[a]ny

28

-15- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 | subsequent [Oversight Board] actions addressing the Agency's implementation of the
2 approved LRPMP should be submitted to [DOF] for approval."

3 41.

4 On August 27, 2014, the Oversight Board approved a further revised
version of the LRPMP prepared by the Successor Agency, but none of the revisions related
5 to Tres Hermanos.

6 42. In a November 12, 2014 letter from Mr. Howard of DOF to Kevin
7 Radecki, DOF approved the further revised LRPMP.

11 THE POTENTIAL RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT OF TRES HERMANOS

43. In late 2014, the Successor Agency began to receive expressions of
12 interest and offers to purchase Tres Hermanos for residential development. In February
13 2015, Successor Agency staff recommended that the Successor Agency retain a broker to
14 assist in the sale of Tres Hermanos.._In.a.May 5,-2015 memorandum from Kevin Radecki,
15 who also then served as the Executive Director of the Successor Agency, to the Oversight
16 Board, he recommended that the Oversight Board approve The Hoffman Company
17 ("Hoffman") as the Successor Agency's broker. This recommendation followed Hoffman's
18 submittal of a proposal letter, dated April 6, 2015, in which it stated that the "as-is" sale of
19 Tres Hermanos would be in the $100 million plus range, while the sales price if the
20 property was entitled for residential development would be in the $250 to $400 million
21 range "or more depending on site constraints . . .." On June 2, 2015, the Oversight Board
22 approved the retention of Hoffman as the Successor Agency's exclusive broker for the sale
23 of Tres Hermanos. Notwithstanding this Oversight Board approval and the Successor
24 Agency's delivery of the brokerage agreement to DOF, the Successor Agency never
25 executed it and, at least until June 7, 2016, did not explain to the Oversight Board why it
26 failed to do so.

27 44. In an April 27, 2015 letter from broker Cushman & Wakefield
28 ("Cushman") to Tim Spohn, then Chairman of the Successor Agency Board, Cushman
-16- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 presented an offer from GH America Investments Group, Inc. ("GH America") to purchase
2 Tres Hermanos within 90 days for the greater of $101 million or the fair market value of
3 the property, as established by an appraisal. It also provided proof of available funds.

4 45. However, GH America and its representatives had great difficulty
5 getting the attention of the Successor Agency and the Oversight Board, even as it
6 sweetened its offer. On May 27, 2015, it offered to triple its initial deposit from
7 $1,010,000 to $3,010,000. In a June 11, 2015 letter from Cushman to Mark Radecki, the
8 Mayor of Industry and the new Chairman of the Successor Agency Board, Cushman
9 restated GH America's $101 million offer and related terms. Cushman restated the offer
10 for a third time in a July 8, 2015 letter to Paul Philips, the new Industry City Manager. GH
11 America's attorney, John Gordon, requested in an August 5, 2015 email to Diane

- 12 Schlichting, the Executive Assistant to the Industry City Manager (and also the Secretary
13 of the Oversight Board), and in an attached letter of the same date to Mr. Philips, that GH
14 America's offer be agendized for the August.2.7, 2015 Successor Agency Board meeting
15 and the September 1, 2015 Oversight Board meeting. It was not. Instead, GH America
16 was advised to speak for three minutes during the public comment periods.
17 46. That is what GH America was forced to do. First, on August 27,
18 2015, Brent Little, a representative of South Coast Communities, GH America's residential
19 development partner, conveyed GH America's offer during the public comment portion of
20 a Successor Agency Board meeting.

21 47. Then, Mr. Gordon spoke at the October 1, 2015 Oversight Board
22 meeting and advised that GH America had not received a response to its offer for over four
23 months, but that his client was ready, willing and able to purchase Tres Hermanos. James
24 Casso, the legal counsel for the Successor Agency (and also the Industry City Attorney),
25 indicated that he and Mr. Philips (who was by then both Industry City Manager and a
26 member of the Oversight Board) had been directed by the City Council to "look at
27 different options with regard to Tres Hermanos," and that they hoped to reach a conclusion
28 within 45-60 days. Santos Kreimann, the Chairman of the Oversight Board, requested that
-17- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

4.

1 the City and the Successor Agency at least acknowledge receipt of GH America's offer,

2 which Mr. Casso said they would do. However, in a subsequent October 22, 2015 email,

3 Mr. Gordon advised Ms. Schlichting that GH America had still not received any such
4 acknowledgment. GH did not receive that acknowledgment until January 14, 2016.

5

6 INDUSTRY DECIDES IT WANTS TO PURCHASE TRES HERMANOS

7 48. Meanwhile, as Mr. Casso stated on October 1, 2015, the Successor
8 Agency and Industry were indeed discussing their options regarding the sale of Tres

9 Hermanos, but they were doing so behind closed doors. Item 11.1 on the Agenda for the
10 September 24, 2015 Industry City Council meeting was a "closed session" discussion,
11 titled "Conference with real estate negotiators pursuant to Government Code Section
12 54956.8," ostensibly regarding the sale of Tres Hermanos. The Agenda Item only
13 referenced the Assessor Parcel Numbers for the property, with no reference to "Tres
14 Hermanos," and therefore effectively concealed from the public that the acquisition_of.Tres
15 Hermanos was the subject of the private discussion. The meeting minutes for the
16 September 24 meeting did not include any discussion of Agenda Item 11.1. A few days
17 prior to that meeting, on September 21, Oversight Board Chairman Kreimann emailed Ms.
18 Schlichting regarding his understanding that Item 11.1 related to Tres Hermanos and
19 requested notification of any action items reported out of the closed session discussion.
20 49. A few days after that City Council meeting, on September 30,
21 Ms. Schlichting emailed John Laurain to "let me know the timing and cost to prepare an
22 appraisal for" Tres Hermanos. She also wanted to know the status of an appraisal that Mr.
23 Laurain was already preparing for Industry with respect to the approximate 800 acres of
24 the adjacent Firestone Scout Reservation (the "800-Acre Firestone Property") that was then
25 still owned by the Boy Scouts. On October 5, Mr. Laurain submitted a written proposal to
26 the Successor Agency to prepare an appraisal for Tres Hermanos. The proposal states in
27 part that "we will need to review any available studies pertaining to the subject site, in
28 order to determine if the highest and best use of the site is as existing open space, and/or if

-18- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETTTION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 there are any other viable private uses of the subject property . . .." On October 22, 2015,
2 Mr. Philips authorized the preparation of the appraisal.

3 50. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that on

4 October 8, 2015, the City Council approved a contract with Cordoba Corporation to
5 provide unspecified real estate advisory services relating in part to the development of Tres

6 Hermanos.

7 51. Finally, at the Oversight Board meeting on January 27, 2016,
8 Mr. Casso, the Industry City Attorney and the Successor Agency's counsel, publicly
9 disclosed to the Oversight Board that the City Council had directed him and Mr. Philips to
10 begin the process for Industry to acquire Tres Hermanos and other Successor Agency
11 properties that were not currently in escrow or for which no agreement had been entered
12 into with a developer. Chairman Kreimann "asked that Jim Rabe of Keyser Marston
13 continue to be used as a third-party financial advisor to confirm that all transactions are at
14  fair market value."

15 52. A few days later, on February 2, 2016, Mr. Laurain delivered to Mr.
16 Casso an Appraisal Report for Tres Hermanos (the "Laurain Appraisal"). Contrary to
17 appraisal practice, the Laurain Appraisal did not determine the fair market value of the
18  property based on its highest and best use. Instead, the appraisal was based on a
19 "hypothetical condition" that the appraisal acknowledged was "contrary to known fact."
20 The hypothetical condition stated in the Laurain Appraisal was as follows:
21

22 While the subject parcels are zoned for agricultural use or low density single-family residential use, per the City of industry, it is understood
23 that the subject property will be encumbered with the covenant that

24 will restrict the use of the subject land as open space, public use or preservation use. Said covenant will "run with the land," thereby

25 making the subject property an effective open space land parcel. The subject property, therefore, has been appraised as open space land
26 (emphasis added).

27 53. Based on that hypothetical condition, the Laurain Appraisal
28 determined that the value of Tres Hermanos as open space was $41.65 million. The
-19- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

t appraisal did not determine the value of the property based on any other "public use,'
2 notwithstanding that the hypothetical condition would allow other public uses.

3 54. On February 23, 2016, shortly after the Successor Agency received
4 the Laurain Appraisal, the Successor Agency Board met in closed session to discuss Tres
5 Hermanos pursuant to Agenda Item 6.5, which stated "Conference with real property
6 negotiators pursuant to Government Code Section 54956.8." The minutes for this meeting
7 state that, with respect to Item 6.5, "the Board took no reportable action."

8 55. At the March 11, 2016 Oversight Board meeting, Mr. Gordon, the
9 attorney for GH America, again spoke during the public comment period regarding his
10 client's offer to purchase Tres Hermanos for $101 million. He was asked to provide
11 documentation to the Oversight Board relating to that offer.
12

13 THE MASTER LEASE AND INDUSTRY'S COVERT PLAN TO DEVELOP
A MAIOR SOLAR PROJECT ON TRES HERMANOS

15 56. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that prior to
16 May 17, 2016, Industry was negotiating the terms of a master ground lease (the "Original
17 Master Lease") with San Gabriel WP, but that neither the existence nor substance of those
18 negotiations was disclosed to the public at any meeting of the Industry City Council or in
19 any agenda or minutes for any such meeting.

20 57. On May 9, 2016, San Gabriel WP executed the Original Master
21 Lease, as tenant, and on May 17, 2016, Industry executed the Original Master Lease, as
22 landlord. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that (a) Industry did
23 not provide any public notice of the City Council's intention to approve the Original
24 Master Lease, (b) the public had no opportunity to address the City Council prior to its
25 approval of the Original Master Lease, (c) the City Council did not approve the Original
26 Master Lease in open session at a public meeting and (d) Industry did not publicly disclose
27 the existence of the Original Master Lease for approximately one year after it was
28

-20- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 approved, and then only in response to Diamond Bar's Brown Act demand letter and

2 Chino Hills' Public Records Act requests.

3 58. Pursuant to the Original Master Lease, Industry purported to lease
4 three parcels of land with an aggregate size of approximately 5,500 acres, including (a) the

5 2,400-Acre Firestone Property, which it already owned, (b) Tres Hermanos, which it did
6 not own and which includes approximately 2,445 acres of land, and (c) the 800-Acre
7 Firestone Property, which it did not own at time (the "Total Site"). Recital A states that

8 the legal description of the Total Site is attached as Exhibit "A", but Chino Hills is
9 informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the legal description was omitted from the
10| executed Original Master Lease.

11 59. The Original Master Lease includes the following provisions:

12 a. Sections 2.1 and 2.2 provide that the term is 25 years and San
13 Gabriel WP has the right to sublease portions of the Total Site to subtenants for terms of
14 Lup to 65 years.Section.3.1 provides that the annuaLrent is $1.00

15 b. Section 2.3 provides that Industry has the right to terminate the
16 Master Lease if San Gabriel WP has not:

17 i. submitted a request for an initial study and notice of
18 preparation under CEQA for a photovoltaic solar project with an aggregate of 450
19 megawatts of rated annual output (the "Minimum Solar Project") by November 17,
20 2016.

21 ii. submitted to the (unspecified) lead agency any other
22 studies required under CEQA within six months after a request by the lead agency (if an
23 environmental impact report ("EIR") is not required).

24 iii. submitted to the lead agency a draft EIR for the
25 Minimum Solar Project by May 17, 2018 (if an EIR is required) or by May 17, 2019 if the
26 lead agency does not allow San Gabriel WP to prepare the draft EIR.
27

28

-21- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR

.

1 iv. received certification of the EIR or other CEQA
2 document within one year after the applicable document is completed, with extensions in
3 the event of a legal challenge.

4 V. commenced physical construction of a project within
one year after the lead agency certifies the EIR or other CEQA document and the
6 challenge period has expired without a challenge.
7 vi. generated and paid to Industry net earnings of at least
8 (A) $2 million per year within three years after the commencement of construction or
9 (B) $4 million per year within 10 years after the commencement of construction, provided
10 that Industry's right to terminate the Master Lease expires upon completion of one or
11 more photovoltaic projects that produce an aggregate of at least 50 megawatts per
12 year.
13 C. Article XXI provides that the parties agree to execute a
14. memorandum.of the Original Master Lease that would be recorded-against the-Total-Site-at-
15 San Gabriel WP's election. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon, alleges, that
16 the memorandum was never recorded.

17 d. Section 24.2 provides that, with respect to all photovoltaic
18 solar projects proposed a for a portion of the Total Site, San Gabriel WP will submit a
19 "request for Industry to participate therein and contribute financially thereto" and describes
20 the materials and information that must be submitted to Industry for its review.
21 e. Section 24.3 provides that Industry may approve or disapprove
22 any such request in its sole discretion. If Industry approves a request, it must (i) contribute
23 50% of the required capital expenditures (net of indebtedness), (ii) construct and pay for
24 required infrastructure and (iii) pay for 50% of any construction overruns (the "Industry
25 Contribution"). In return, Industry will receive the greater of (iv) the fair market rental
26 value of the applicable portion of the Total Site plus 12% of the net operating income for
27 the project, (v) 6% annual return on the Industry Contribution and (vi) 50% of (A) the net
28

-22- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 operating income for the project plus (B) any net extraordinary gains from the sale or
2 refinancing of the solar project.
3 f. Section 25.1 provides that Industry will reimburse San Gabriel
4 WP for its pre-development costs for solar projects in the maximum aggregate amount
5 of $5 million.

6 60. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that
7 commencing in or around April 2016, both Industry and San Gabriel WP began to
8 assemble and put to work extensive teams of consultants and attorneys to design, engineer,

Q prepare studies, plans and project documents, conduct environmental review and provide
10 legal advice with regard to the contemplated solar projects.
11

12 61. Industry and San Gabriel WP subsequently entered into a First
13 Amendment to Master Ground Lease (the "First Amendment") dated as of November 15,
14 2016. The First Amendment includes the following provisions
15 a. Recital A states that Industry had acquired the 800-Acre
16 Firestone Property.

17 b. Section 2.3 was amended to (i) extend the time for San Gabriel
18 WP to submit an initial study/notice of preparation under CEQA for the Minimum Solar
19 Project to June 30, 2017 and (ii) extend the time to submit a draft EIR to November 30,
20 2018 or, if the lead agency does not allow San Gabriel WP to prepare the draft EIR, to
21 November 30, 2019.

22 62. Industry and San Gabriel WP subsequently entered into a Second
23 Amendment to Master Ground Lease (the "Second Amendment") dated as of April 13,
24 2017. The Second Amendment includes the following provisions:
25 a. A new Section 2.4 claims, almost a year after the execution of
26 the Original Master Lease, that "[t]he approval of this Lease is not intended to be a 'project'
27 because it does not authorize any physical change in the environment" and that "Landlord
28

-23- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

will not issue any approval or entitlement to Tenant to proceed with any project on all or
2 any portion of the Total Site unless and until compliance with CEQA is completed .. .."
b. Section 25.1 was amended to more than double Industry's
reimbursement obligation for San Gabriel WP's pre-development costs for solar projects
5 to the maximum aggregate amount of $11.5 million.

6 63. Industry and San Gabriel WP subsequently entered into a Third
7 Amendment to Master Ground Lease (the "Third Amendment") dated as of May 23, 2017.
8 64. Industry and San Gabriel WP subsequently entered into a Fourth
9 Amendment to Master Ground Lease (the "Fourth Amendment") dated as of June 30,
10 2017.

11

12

13 65. The Fourth Amendment includes the following provisions:

17 30, 2019 or, if the lead agency does not allow San Gabriel WP to prepare the draft EIR, to
18 November 30, 2020.
19 b. Section 25.1 was further amended to almost double Industry's
20 reimbursement obligation for San Gabriel WP's pre-development costs for solar projects
21 to the maximum aggregate amount of $20 million.

22 66. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that (a)
23 Industry did not provide any public notice of the City Council's intention to approve the
24 First Amendment, the Second Amendment, the Third Amendment or the Fourth
25 Amendment (collectively, the "Master Lease Amendments"), (b) the public had no
26 opportunity to address the City Council prior to its approval of any of the Master Lease
27 Amendments, (c) thé City Council did not approve any of the Master Lease Amendments
28 in open session at a public meeting, (d) Industry failed to provide copies of the Master
-24- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PEIITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Lease Amendments to Diamond Bar and Chino Hills in response to Public Records Act
2 requests, the first of which was sent on or around February 9, 2017 and required that they

3 be disclosed, (e) the first notice that either Diamond Bar or Chino Hills received of any of
4 the Master Lease Amendments was when invoices were produced on or about September
5  2, 2017 in response to an August 8, 2017 Chino Hills's Public Records Act request that
6 made reference to the First Amendment and Second Amendment, after which Chino Hills
7 a delivered a Public Records Act request to Industry on September 25, 2017 requesting a
8 copy of the First and Second Amendments and any other amendments to the Original

9 Master Lease, and (f) Industry did not publicly disclose copies of any of the Master Lease
10 Amendments until on or about October 10, 2017, when the Industry City Council posted

11 on its website all four of the Master Lease Amendments in the agenda packet for the
12 proposed ratification of the Master Lease at its October 12, 2017 meeting.

13 67. Shortly after the execution of the Original Master Lease, Mr. Gordon
.14 spoke during the.public.comment period_at the Iune_7, 2.016_Oversight Board meeting._He
15 reiterated GH America's offer to purchase Tres Hermanos. Mr. Little of South Coast
16 Communities then discussed the benefits of the contemplated residential development.
17 Mr. Gordon requested that the Oversight Board adopt a resolution to enter into a purchase
18 and sale agreement with GH America on the terms proposed by GH America. Chairman
19 | Kreimann responded that the Oversight Board could not do that because no such
20 agreement had been negotiated with the Successor Agency. Sean Varner, the Oversight

21 Board's counsel, concurred. A discussion then ensued regarding the City's interest in
22 acquiring Tres Hermanos. Mr. Casso, the Industry City Attorney and Successor Agency
23 counsel, responded that he would advise the City Council of the Oversight Board's desire
24 to know whether Industry wanted to purchase Tres Hermanos and would report back on
25 August 31. Mr. Philips, Industry's City Manager and one of the Oversight Board
26 members, stated he would go back to the City Council and Successor Agency for direction,
27| but claimed that Industry had the right to purchase Tres Hermanos over any other bid,
28 apparently regardless of the purchase price offered by Industry. Chino Hills is informed
-25- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

and believes, and thereon alleges that, despite the fact the Original Master Lease had been
2 executed just three weeks earlier, neither Mr. Casso nor Mr. Philips disclosed (a) the
existence of the Original Master Lease to the Oversight Board or (b) that Industry had
4 already committed to allow the development of solar projects on Tres Hermanos after it
5 acquired the property.

6 68. About a month later, the City Council again met in closed session at
7 its August 11, 2016 meeting to discuss Tres Hermanos pursuant to Agenda Item 10.2,
8 which was titled "Conference with real property negotiators pursuant to Government Code

9 Section 54956.8." It stated that the "City Negotiators" were Mr. Philips, the City Manager,
10 and Mr. Casso, the City Attorney, and that the "Negotiating Parties" for the seller were Mr.
11 Philips, the Executive Director of the Successor Agency, and Mr. Casso, the Successor
12 Agency's counsel. In other words, Mr. Philips and Mr. Casso represented both the buyer
13 and the seller.

14

15 INDUSTRY'S FIRST ATTEMPT TO PURCHASE TRES HERMANOS

16 AT AN EXTREMELY LOW PRICE AND WITHOUT CEQA REVIEW

17 69. At its September 8, 2016 meeting, the Industry City Council, under
18 | Agenda Item 7.2, considered the approval of a purchase and sale agreement (the "Tres
19 Hermanos PSA"), pursuant to which Industry would purchase Tres Hermanos from the
20 Successor Agency for an unspecified purpose. The stated purchase price was $41.65
21 million, consistent with the Laurain Appraisal and its hypothetical limitation to open space
22 use. However, the required form of grant deed attached as Exhibit C to the Tres Hermanos
23 PSA did not include any restriction regarding the permitted uses on the property.
24 70. Attached to the Agenda was a September 1, 2016 memorandum from
25 Mr. Casso, as City Attorney, in which he stated that (a) the Redevelopment Dissolution
26 Act required the Successor Agency to dispose of its property "in a manner that maximizes
27 value," (b) "[t]he City will purchase the Property from the Agency for the appraised value
28 as open space of $41,650,000" and (c) Industry "proposes to use the Property for open
-26- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

P space, public facility use or preservation use . ..." Mr. Casso did not disclose the

2 existence of the Original Master Lease, which had been executed more than three months

3 earlier.

4 71. Also attached to the Agenda was proposed Resolution No. CC 2016-

5 62 (the "9/8/16 City Council PSA Resolution") to approve the acquisition of Tres

6 Hermanos and make the requisite CEQA findings. That resolution stated:

a. Pursuant to the LRPMP, the Successor Agency "desires to sell
8 the Property at its highest and best use, maximizing its value ...."
9 b. "The purchase price is $41,560,000, which represents an
10 amount equal to or greater than the current fair market value of the Property, as determined
11 by" the Laurain Appraisal.

12 C. Industry's purchase of Tres Hermanos was exempt from
13 environmental review under CEQA pursuant to the "common sense" exemption in Section
-14 15061(b)(3) of the State CEQA Guidelines, which applies "where.it can be seen with
15 certainty that there is no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant
16 effect on the environment.' The primary reasons for employing that exemption were that
17 "[t]he sale of the property does not involve any land use entitlements that will allow for
18 development on the property" and "[a]ny future development at the property will be
19 subject to additional environmental review and independent analysis as required by
20 CEQA."

21 72. These statements were inaccurate and extremely misleading because
22 (a) the Laurain Appraisal did not determine that its valuation of $41.65 million reflected
23 the highest and best use of Tres Hermanos, but rather was based on a "hypothetical
24 condition," which was "contrary to known facts,' that Tres Hermanos would be restricted
25 to open space in perpetuity, which would not have allowed the development of the major
26 solar facilities contemplated in the Original Master Lease or any other development, and
27 therefore resulted in the lowest possible appraised valuation of the property, (b) the $41.65
28 million purchase price therefore would not "maximize" the value of Tres Hermanos, which
-27- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

t the LRPMP states had a fair market value of approximately $85-122 million in April 2103
2 and for which GH America repeatedly and credibly offered the sum of $101 million, (c)
3 the 9/8/16 City Council PSA Resolution relied on the open space assumption in the

4 Laurain Appraisal, which was false because Industry had already committed to allow the
5 development of solar facilities on Tres Hermanos under the Original Master Lease for its
6 financial benefit, and (d) the resolution did not disclose that Industry had committed to
7 lease Tres Hermanos for the development of a major solar facility.
8 73. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the
9 Industry City Council unanimously adopted the 9/8/16 City Council PSA Resolution.
10 74. At its September 8, 2016 meeting, which immediately preceded the
11 City Council meeting, the Successor Agency Board (the members of which are the
12 Industry City Councilmembers), under Agenda Item 5.3, considered the approval of the
13 Tres Hermanos PSA.

14 75 , Included in the Agenda-package-was-a-September-8, 2016
15 memorandum from Mr. Casso, as Successor Agency counsel, in which he stated that (a)
16 the Redevelopment Dissolution Act required the Successor Agency to dispose of its
17 property "in a manner that maximizes value," (b) "[t]he City will purchase the Property
18 from the Agency for the appraised value as open space of $41,650,000," (c) Industry
19 | "proposes to use the Property for open space, public facility use or preservation use" and
20 (d) the "proposed purchase/sale ... awaits Oversight Board and Department of Finance
21 approval, in compliance with California law."

22 76. Also attached to the Agenda was proposed Resolution No. SA 2016-
23 15 (the "9/8/16 Successor Agency PSA Resolution") to approve the sale of Tres Hermanos
24 and make the requisite CEQA findings. That resolution includes all of the statements
25 described in paragraph 71, above, which statements were inaccurate and extremely
26 misleading for the reasons set forth in paragraph 72, above.
27

28

-28- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

77. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the
2 Successor Agency Board unanimously adopted the 9/8/16 Successor Agency PSA
3 Resolution.

4 78. Shortly after the City Council and Successor Agency Board took these
actions, LA County objected to the proposed sale on multiple grounds. In a September 29,
6 2016 letter from David Howard, Assistant Chief Executive Officer for LA County, to the
7 Oversight Board, he requested that the Oversight Board reject the Successor Agency's
8 approval of the sale, and undertake an independent appraisal of Tres Hermanos, for the
9 following reasons:

10 a. The LRPMP lists the current value of the property at $85-122
11 million and GH America offered $101 million for the property, an offer that apparently
12 was never forwarded to the Oversight Board. Therefore, the proposed $41.65 million
13 purchase price would not maximize the value of the property, which the Successor Agency
14 l holds-in-trust-on-behalf-ef-all-of-the taxing entities.

15 b. The City's bid of $41.65 million was based on the Laurain
16 Appraisal, which was flawed because it was based on a hypothetical assumption that Tres
17 Hermanos was encumbered with a covenant that restricts its use to open space, when in
18 reality no such covenant existed.

19

20 THE OVERSIGHT BOARD REJECTS THE $41.65 MILLION SALE

21 79. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that, at its
22 meeting on September 29, 2016, the Oversight Board, by a 5-2 vote, rejected the $41.65
23 million purchase price and requested that the Successor Agency obtain a new appraisal for
24 Tres Hermanos that did not include a hypothetical restriction on the use of the land and
25 instead was based on the current land use and zoning designations for the property in the
26 Diamond Bar and Chino Hills general plans and zoning ordinances.
27 80. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that at no
28 time prior to September 29, 2016 were the members of the Oversight Board made aware of
-29- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

Industry's intent to develop a major solar project on Tres Hermanos, except for (a) Paul
2 Philips, who was, and is, the Industry City Manager, the Executive Director of the
Successor Agency and the real property negotiator for the purchase and sale of Tres
4 Hermanos for both Industry and the Successor Agency, and (ii) Esteban Torres, a former
Congressman who was the City of Industry's other representative on the Board.

6 Mr. Philips had a fiduciary duty to inform the other Oversight Board members of this

7 intended use.

81. Thereafter, the Successor Agency retained Larry Heglar to prepare a
9 second appraisal for Tres Hermanos (the "Heglar Appraisal"), which he delivered to Mr.

10 Casso on December 7, 2016. Unlike the Laurain Appraisal, the Heglar Appraisal did not
11 | include any hypothetical conditions and determined that the fair market value of the
12 property in its "as-is" condition was $100 million as of November 7, 2016, based on its
13 highest and best use of limited residential development. This amount roughly matched GH
14 America's $101 million offer and.matched Hoffman's as-is estimated value of at least $100_
15 million.

16 82. On December 22, 2016, the Successor Agency Board again met in
17 closed session to discuss Tres Hermanos pursuant to Agenda Item 11.1, which is titled

18 "Conference with real property negotiators pursuant to Government Code Section
19 54956.8." It stated that the "City Negotiators" were Mr. Philips, City Manager, and Mr.
20 Casso, City Attorney, and that the "Negotiating Parties" for the seller were Mr. Philips,
21 Executive Director of the Successor Agency, and Mr. Casso, Successor Agency Legal
22 Counsel.

23 83. On or about January 6, 2017, Terracon Consultants, Inc. submitted a
24 proposal to Blue Oak Energy to provide geotechnical services "for the proposed solar farm
25 known as the Tres Hermanos Solar Project" (emphasis added). It set forth specific project
26 details, stating that (a) the proposed solar array fields would occupy an area of
27 approximately 900 acres, (b) the project includes two substations that would be connected
28 by transmission lines approximately 2.5 miles in length, (c) the project includes multiple
-30- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 basins along the base of the canyon (south of Grand Avenue) to retain stormwater runoff,
2 (d) portions of the project site (primarily between the valleys) would be located in
3 liquefaction hazard potential zones, and (e) multiple slopes within the project site are

4 mapped for earthquake-induced landslide hazards. Terracon's proposed compensation was

5 $99,000.

6 84. On January 12, 2017, the Industry City Council again met in closed
7 session to discuss Tres Hermanos pursuant to Agenda Item 11.4, titled "Conference with
8 real property negotiators pursuant to Government Code Section 54956.8." It stated that the
9 "City Negotiators" were Mr. Philips, City Manager, and Mr. Casso, City Attorney, and that
10 the "Negotiating Parties" for the seller were Mr. Philips, Executive Director of the
11 Successor Agency, and Mr. Casso, Successor Agency Legal Counsel.
12

13 THE INDUSTRY CITY COUNCIL AND SUCCESSOR AGENCY

14 BOARD APPROVE A $100 MILLION SALE

15 85. As Industry's predevelopment work continued with respect to the
16 proposed solar development, Industry and the Successor Agency decided to modify and re-
17 approve the Tres Hermanos PSA. At a joint special meeting on January 13, 2017, under
18 Agenda Item 5.1, the City Council and the Successor Agency Board considered the
19 approval of a revised Tres Hermanos PSA (the "$100 Million Tres Hermanos PSA"). The
20 principal revision was to increase the purchase price from $41.65 million to $100 million,
21 based on the Heglar Appraisal.
22 86. Attached to the Agenda were two memoranda dated January 13,
23 2017 from Mr. Casso to the City Council and Successor Agency, respectively, in which he
24 stated that (a) the Dissolution Act required the Successor Agency to dispose of its property
25 | "in a manner that maximizes value," (b) "[t]he City will purchase the Property from the
26 Agency for the appraised value as open space of $100,000,000," (c) Industry "proposes to
27 use the Property for open space, public facility use or preservation use" and (d) the
28

-31- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

~ "proposed purchase/sale ... awaits Oversight Board and Department of Finance approval,
2 in compliance with California law."
87. Also attached to the Agenda was proposed Resolution No. CC 2017-

4 01 (the "1/13/17 City Council PSA Resolution") regarding the acquisition of Tres
Hermanos and the requisite CEQA findings. That resolution stated:

a. Pursuant to the LRPMP, the Successor Agency "desires to sell

7 the Property at its highest and best use, maximizing its value ...."

b. "The purchase price is $100,000,000, which represents an
9 amount equal to or greater than the current fair market value of the Property, as determined
10 by" the Heglar Appraisal.

11 C. Industry's purchase of Tres Hermanos was exempt from
12 environmental review under CEQA pursuant to the "common sense" exemption in
13 Section 15061(b)(3) of the State CEQA. Guidelines . . .. The primary reasons were still
-14 that "[t]he-sale-of.the property does-not involve-any land.use.entitlements-that-will-allox
15 for development on the property" and "[a]ny future development at the property will be
16 subject to additional environmental review and independent analysis as required by
17 CEQA."

18 88. The 1/13/17 City Council PSA Resolution did not include any
19 operative statement that the City Council approved the $100 Million Tres Hermanos PSA
20 or disclose that Industry had committed to lease Tres Hermanos to San Gabriel WP for the
21 development of a major solar facility.

22 89. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the
23 City Council unanimously adopted the 1/13/17 City Council PSA Resolution.

24 90. Also attached to the Agenda was proposed Resolution No. SA 2017-
25  02 (the "1/13/17 Successor Agency PSA Resolution") regarding the sale of Tres Hermanos
26 and CEQA findings. That resolution states:
27 a. Pursuant to the LRPMP, the Successor Agency "desires to sell
28 the Property at its highest and best use, maximizing its value . . . .'

4 C. Industry's purchase of Tres Hermanos was exempt from

5 environmental review under CEQA pursuant to the "common sense" exemption in Section
6 15061(b)(3) of the State CEQA Guidelines.

7 91. The 1/13/17 Successor Agency PSA Resolution did not include any
8 operative statement that the Successor Agency Board approved the $100 Million Tres

9 Hermanos PSA or disclose that Industry had committed to lease Tres Hermanos to San
10 Gabriel WP for the development of a major solar facility, which the Successor Agency
11 Board obviously knew.

12 92. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the
13 Successor Agency Board unanimously adopted the 1/13/17 Successor Agency PSA
14 Resolution _

15 93. After the Successor Agency Board approved the $100 Million Tres
16 Hermanos PSA, the Chino Hills City Council requested, in a February 6, 2017 letter to
17 Sean Varner, General Counsel for the Oversight Board, that the Oversight Board (a)
18 require Industry to request and obtain a general plan conformity finding pursuant to
19 Government Code Section 65402(b) before approving the sale and (b) require CEQA
20 review for Industry's planned project (Chino Hills still did not know at this point that
21 Industry's project was a major solar facility) .

22

23 ALL THE WHILE WORK ON THE SOLAR PROJECT

24 CONTINUES IN EARNEST

25 94. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that as of
26 April 21, 2017, San Gabriel WP had assembled an extensive team of consultants and
27 attorneys to develop solar projects on Tres Hermanos (the "San Gabriel Consultants").

7 Solar ProjectCo 1, LLC, which Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon alleges,

8 is affiliated with San Gabriel WP, as seller, and the Industry Public Utilities Commission

9 (the "IPUC"), as buyer. It states that "Seller wishes to develop, construct, own, operate
10 and maintain a solar photovoltaic electric generation facility ... with a designed output of

THE OVERSIGHT BOARD REDUCES THE PURCHASE PRICE TO $41.65

2 MILLION AND ATTEMPTS TO JUSTIFY IT BY IMPOSING A MEANINGLESS

3 COVENANT

4 103. More than seven months after Industry and the Successor Agency
5 Board approved the $100 Million Tres Hermanos PSA, and without seeking a general plan
6 conformance finding as requested by the Chino Hills, the Successor Agency requested the
7 Oversight Board's approval of the sale. The Oversight Board considered the sale at a
8 special meeting on August 24, 2017 (the "August 24 Meeting"). The agenda description
9 generally provided that the Oversight Board would be considering a resolution to approve
10 the $100 Million Tres Hermanos PSA.

11 104. Included in the agenda materials for the August 24 Meeting was an
12 August 15, 2017 memorandum from Varner & Brent LLP, counsel for the Oversight
13 Board, stating that (a) the Laurain Appraisal, which established a market value of $41.65
-14 million, was based on-a nonexistent, hypothetical-condition,-(b)-the-Oversight-Board
15 requested a new appraisal without the hypothetical condition to achieve the highest and
16 best use, (c) the second, Heglar Appraisal valued Tres Hermanos at $100 million based on

17 its current zoning designations, (d) pursuant to the 2/21/14 DOF Approval Letter for the
18 LRPMP (i.e., the Long-Range Property Management Plan prepared by the Successor
19 Agency), any Successor Agency action taken pursuant to the approved LRPMP is subject
20 to Oversight Board approval, (e) GH America had increased its offer to $108 million and,
21 at the request of the Oversight Board, had provided a presentation concerning its intended
22 development of the property, which included approximately 1,881 residential units, mixed-
23 use, commercial and open space, (f) the Oversight Board has fiduciary responsibilities to
24 taxing entities that benefit from the distributions of property tax and other revenues and (g)
25 the disposition of any property must be done in a manner aimed a at maximizing value.
26 105. Also included in the agenda materials for the August 24 Meeting was

27 a memorandum from Mr. Casso dated August 22, 2017, which stated that (a) that there was
28 no purpose or value in placing a covenant on Tres Hermanos to restrict its use to
-38- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

public/municipal purposes because Government Code Section 37351 already imposed that
2 restriction and (b) the Oversight Board had a ministerial duty to approve the $100 Million

3 Tres Hermanos PSA because the sales price was consistent with the LRPMP.

4 106. Also included in the agenda materials was proposed Resolution No.
5 OB 2017-05 (the "8/24/17 OB PSA Resolution") to approve the Successor Agency's sale
6 of Tres Hermanos to Industry and make CEQA findings. The resolution states that (a)
7| "[t]he Successor Agency intends to sell the Property to the City of Industry .. for a
8 purchase price of $100,000,000, which represents an amount equal to or the fair market
9 value of the Property, as determined by" the Heglar Appraisal, (b) the sale "must be
10 completed .. . in a manner aimed at maximizing value" and (c) the Oversight Board
11 "hereby approves the sale and disposition of the Property in accordance with the terms of
12 the approved LRPMP and the Purchase Agreement."
13 107. On August 24, 2017, prior to the August 24 Meeting, David DeBerry,
14 the Diamond Rar.City Attorney, submitted_a letter to the_Qversight.Roard_in_opposition.to
15 the sale. That letter documented that the approval of the $100 Million Tres Hermanos PSA
16 would be unlawful, in part because (a) the LRPMP does not require the Successor Agency
17 to sell the property to Industry for $8 million less than the $108 million offered by GH
18 America, (b) the approval of the sale would place Industry's interests ahead of the taxing
19 entities, in violation of the Oversight Board's fiduciary duties, (c) Industry's proposed solar
20 use was entirely inconsistent with the general plan and zoning laws of both Diamond Bar
21 and Chino Hills, (d) the Oversight Board could not approve the sale because Industry had
22 not submitted a request to either Diamond Bar or Chino Hills for a general plan conformity
23 finding consistent with Government Code Section 65402(b), (e) no environmental review
24| of the project had been undertaken as required by CEQA, and (f) that Industry's acquisition
25 of the property was not "necessary or proper for municipal purposes" in violation of
26 Government Code Section 37351.

-39- FIRST AMENDED VERIFED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

108. Konradt Bartlam, the Chino Hills City Manager, also submitted a
2 letter to the Oversight Board prior to the August 24 Meeting in opposition to the sale. In
3 that letter, he documented the following objections:

4 a. Industry had deceived the public for years regarding its plans
5 for Tres Hermanos and concealed its plan to develop significant solar facilities on Tres
6 Hermanos and that it was inconceivable that Industry would pay $100 million for the
7 property to preserve it as open space.

8 b. The Oversight Board could not approve the $100 Million Tres
9 Hermanos PSA because the required CEQA review for the project had not occurred.
10 Chino Hills concurrently submitted numerous documents it had obtained from Industry in
11 response to Public Records Act requests, including many of the documents discussed in
12 preceding paragraphs, which demonstrated that Industry had firmly committed to the
13 development of large-scale solar projects on Tres Hermanos, had sufficiently developed
14 plans for that project and had already expended many millions of dollars_for consultants.
15 As a result, the general exemption in Section 15061(b)(3) of the State CEQA Guidelines
16 did not apply. To the contrary, the proposed solar project would result in a number of
17 significant environmental impacts, including significant biological, aesthetic and cultural
18 resource impacts that required the preparation of an EIR prior to the Oversight Board's
19 approval of the sale. These statements of environmental concerns were supported by
20| biological and cultural resource studies of Chino Hills, and Tres Hermanos in particular, in
21 connection with the update of the Chino Hills General Plan adopted in 2015, as well as
22 studies showing the harmful effects of solar arrays on wildlife and birds.

23 C. Industry failed to seek a general plan conformity finding from
24 either Chino Hills or Diamond Bar in accordance with Government Code
25 Section 65402(b).

26 109. During the August 24 Meeting, representatives from Diamond Bar
27 and Chino Hills orally apprised the Oversight Board of the concerns raised in their letters.
28 In addition thereto, the following comments were made:

-40- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 a. Mr. Casso spoke at length in support of the $100 million
2 purchase price approved by the Successor Agency. He stated that Mr. Rabe of Keyser
3 Marston had opined that the $100 million Heglar Appraisal had been "done correctly and

4 was compliant with the normal appraisal processes and procedures, and the [$100 million]

5 value is a reasonable value. The City has offered that." He later emphasized that the $100
6 million purchase price approved by the Successor Agency Board was consistent with the
7 LRPMP and maximized value:

8 When you've got a Long-Range Property Management Plan that gives you value, if I recall it correctly, somewhere between $85 to $120 million for this piece of dirt, and we have an appraisal [i.e.,
10 the Heglar Appraisal], which this body's consultant, Mr. Rabe, has

11 said - this appraisal - he gave it a thumbs up, then I think we have fallen within the confines of the Long-Range Property
12 Management Plan and value has been maximized.

13 b. Mr. Casso also stated "this project here - the City is offering to
-14--put up.it's looking at the solar farm projec.tr_..._..

15 C. Chairman Kreimann, who stated that he regularly reviews
16 appraisals as part of his job, was concerned that the Heglar Appraisal undervalued the
17 Property at $100 million because there was no discussion or analysis in the Heglar
18 Appraisal "about the possibility of there being a solar farm that wasn't contemplated as
19 part of this particular appraisal."

20 d. Chairman Kreimann also stated that "we have a fiduciary
21 responsibility to the communities that are going to be impacted. And in this particular
22 instance, Industry is not a taxing entity. They're not. The County is, the City of Diamond
23 Bar, Chino Hills .. they're impacted."

24 e. Nathan Heyde, the Oversight Board's counsel, advised that the
25 Oversight Board had an obligation to the taxing entities to maximize value in the sale of
26 Tres Hermanos.

27 110. Following public comment, no motion was made to approve or
28 disapprove the $100 Million Tres Hermanos PSA approved by the Successor Agency.
-41- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 111. Instead, once public comment was closed and without addressing
2 any of the concerns raised by members of the public, Mr. Philips, acting at least ostensibly
3 in his capacity as a member of the Oversight Board, quickly made a motion to direct the

4 Successor Agency to sell the Property to Industry for $41.65 million, $58.35 million less
5 that Industry had offered, and place a deed restriction on Tres Hermanos limiting its use to

6 "open space, public use or preservation." He took this action knowing that Mr. Casso had
7 already opined that such a deed restriction served no purpose and had no impact on the
8 value to Industry and without disclosing Industry's intent to develop a major a solar facility
on Tres Hermanos. The motion was seconded by Esteban Torres, Industry's second Board
10 appointee, who Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, is the father-in-
11 law of Mr. Casso.

12 112. Chairman Kreimann then offered an amended motion that also
13 included terms different from the terms in the $100 Million Tres Hermanos PSA, which
14 terms included the-preparation_-of.a-new_appraisal-for Tres Hermanos-that-assumed the
15 development of a solar project on the property and the requirement that CEQA review
16 occur prior to the approval of the proposed sale. Mr. Casso vigorously objected to that
17 amended motion, repeatedly stating it exceeded the scope of the Oversight Board's
18 "statutory authority." He stated no objection, however, to Mr. Philips' motion,
19 notwithstanding that it significantly deviated from the terms of the $100 Million Tres
20 Hermanos PSA and directly contradicted his earlier statements that the much higher
21 $100 million purchase price was required for compliance with the LRPMP. Mr. Casso was
22 allowed to speak at length during the Oversight Board meeting and was the only member
23 of the public that was allowed to address the Oversight Board after Mr. Philips' motion,
24 which deprived the rest of the public of an opportunity to comment on an action that
25 differed dramatically from what was noticed in the agenda and agenda materials.
26 113. Mr. Philips then stated why he had proposed t significant decrease in
27 the purchase price: "Frankly, there's more cash to put into the [solar] project." He then
28 characterized this as a primary "justification" for his proposed $41.65 million purchase
-42- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 price. In other words, this was Industry's tactic to effectively extract almost $60 million of
2 Tres Hermanos's value and use it to fund the Tres Hermanos solar project, to the detriment
UJ: of the Diamond Bar, Chino Hills and the other taxing entities which had a beneficial
4 interest in the sale of Tres Hermanos and to which the Oversight Board owed a fiduciary
5 duty.

6 114. In making his motion, Mr. Philips was hopelessly conflicted. He had
7 the triple role of Industry City Manager, Successor Agency Executive Director and

8

9 Oversight Board member. As a result, he put Industry's interests ahead of the taxing

10 entities to whom he owed a fiduciary duty.

11 115. After further discussion, Mr. Philips' motion was narrowly approved
by a 4-3 vote, with Mr. Philips casting the deciding vote. Outside of Mr. Casso, no
12 member of the public was afforded the opportunity to address the Oversight Board on the
13 extreme reduction in price or the proposed deed restriction.
14 116.L_The next day, in an August 25,20.1.7 letter from Mark Hensley, the
15 Chino Hills City Attorney, to Chikako Takagi-Galamba, a DOF Manager, Mr. Hensley
16 requested that DOF exercise its authority to review the Oversight Board's action pursuant
17 to HSC Section 34179(h). He stated that (a) Mr. Philips rationale for discounting the
18 purchase price by more than $58 million was to provide more money for Industry to spend
19| on the project, when neither he nor anyone else involved with the project had explained
20 what the project was, (b) the Oversight Board had no legal authority to reduce the purchase
21 price and its action constituted a gift of public funds and failed to maximize the value of
22 the property, (c) the resuscitated restrictive covenant was illusory since Government Code
23 Section 37351 already prohibits a city from acquiring real property outside its boundaries
24 for any purpose other than "municipal purposes," and therefore there was no consideration
25 for the huge price reduction, contrary to the Oversight Board's fiduciary duty to maximize
26 the value of the property, (d) the sale was inconsistent with the LRPMP, which valued Tres
27 Hermanos at approximately $85-122 million, (e) Industry had deceived the Oversight
28 Board and the public by constantly making false statements that the property would be
-43- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 used for open space and recreational purposes, while it was spending millions of dollars to
2 cause the development of a major solar facility, and (f) as a result of this deception, the

3 affected taxing agencies have been harmed.

4 117. On August 28, 2017, Mr. DeBerry wrote to Ms. Takagi-Galamba and

5 voiced Diamond Bar's own strong objections to the Oversight Board's action and also
6 requested that DOF exercise its authority to review it. He stated that (a) the $41.6 million
7| purchase price failed to maximize the value of Tres Hermanos, (b) the severely discounted
8 purchase price was inconsistent with the $85-122 million value set forth in the LRPMP and
failed to the comply with the "basic criteria" for a proposed purchase agreement, including
10 the requirement that the property be sold at a "reasonable price,' (c) the Laurain Appraisal
11 was based on the assumption that the property would only be used as open space, but the
12 restrictive covenant would allow any public use so that the Laurain Appraisal provided no
13 basis for the $41.6 million purchase price, (d) Industry "may, as a matter of law, only
14 purchase property outside its jurisdiction.as_is_necessary_or proper for municipal purposes
15 under Government Code Section 37351, (e) the Oversight Board had no authority to
16 approve a $41.6 million sale because the Successor Agency Board had not approved a sale
17 for $41.6 million, (f) the public notice for the Oversight Board meeting was deficient, (g)
18 the Oversight Board's approval violated CEQA because there was no environmental
19 review at all and (h) the Oversight Board's approval violated Government Code Section
20 65402 because Industry had not requested a general plan conformity review from either
21 Diamond Bar or Chino Hills.

22 118. In an August 31, 2017 letter from Dena Smith, the Interim Chief
23 Executive Officer of SB County, to Ms. Takagi-Galamba and Mr. Howard of DOF, SB
24 County also requested that DOF exercise its right to review the Oversight Board's
25 approval of the sale. The letter emphasized that (a) Tres Hermanos had been appraised at a
26 value of $100 million and Industry had offered to purchase it for that amount and,
27 therefore, the Oversight Board's approval of the sale for $41.65 million "based on a
28 specious offer by the City of Industry to restrict the use of the property in a manner already
-44- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 imposed by Government Code Section 37351, violated the Oversight Board's obligation to
2  expeditiously sell the property while maximizing its value" (emphasis in original), and (b)

3 the $41.65 million purchase price was in clear conflict with the LRPMP, which valued

4 Tres Hermanos at between $85-122 million.

5 119. DOF also received an August 31, 2017 letter from Jeff Ballinger,

6 whose firm serves as General Counsel to the Chino Valley Fire District, one of the taxing

7 entities with respect to Tres Hermanos. He set forth the Fire District's vigorous opposition

8 to the Oversight Board's approval of the $41.65 million purchase price. He noted that (a)
the purchase price was based on the Laurain Appraisal, which the Oversight Board had
10 previously rejected because it assumed open space use, (b) the purchase price was
11 approximately $58.4 million less than the $100 million purchase price that Industry had
12 already agreed to pay, (c) the vaguely worded deed restriction approved by the Oversight
13 Board would allow Industry to proceed with its proposed solar project, so Tres Hermanos'
14 value was substantially greater than a property restricted simply for open space uses, and
15 (d) as a result, the $41.6 million purchase price was not representative of the property's
16 value and did not maximize value, and the Oversight Board had therefore abrogated its
17 fiduciary duty to the taxing entities under HSC Section 34179.

19 DIAMOND BAR DEMANDS THE OVERSIGHT BOARD

20 CURE ITS BROWN ACT VIOLATION

21 120. As noted above, the agenda and agenda materials for the August 24
22 Meeting provided the public with no notice of the ultimate action taken by the Oversight
23 Board and what apparently Mr. Philips had in mind all along. The agenda and agenda
24 materials led the public to believe that the Oversight Board was only considering the $100
25 million Tres Hermanos PSA, not a dramatically different real estate deal involving a steep
26 reduction in price based on illusory restrictive covenant. All written and public comments
27 focused on whether the $100 Million Tres Hermanos PSA was appropriate. The public
28

-45- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

was afforded no opportunity whatsoever to comment on the drastically different real estate
2 deal approved by the Oversight Board following Mr. Philip's 11th-hour motion.
3 121. In a September 21, 2017 letter from Mr. DeBerry, the Diamond Bar
4 City Attorney, to the Oversight Board, he submitted a demand to the Oversight Board that
5 it correct violations of the Brown Act relating to its approval of the $41.65 million Tres
6 Hermanos PSA. He stated that the Oversight Board's action violated multiple provisions
7 of the Brown Act that require that actions be taken in a public noticed meeting and in open
8 session, that a description of the Oversight Board's proposed actions appear in the agenda
9 and that the public be afforded a meaningful opportunity to directly address the legislative
10 body before and during consideration of the proposed action. He stated that the Oversight
11 Board's ultimate action was so materially different than what was on the agenda and in the
12 agenda materials that it "provided no clues as to the Board's ultimate action" and therefore
13 failed to meet the letter and spirit of the Brown Act. As required by Government Code
-14 Section-54960.1, Mr. DeBerry demanded that the-Oversight Board-cure its-violations
15 within 30 days.

16 122. In response to Mr. DeBerry's letter, Mr. Varner, the Oversight Board
17 General Counsel, denied that there was any Brown Act violation in an October 18, 2017
18 letter. The 30-day cure period subsequently expired.
19

20 INDUSTRY'S FAILURE TO SEEK GENERAL PLAN CONFORMITY REVIEW

21 IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 65402(b)

22 123. Industry apparently realized that its failure to seek general plan
23 conformity review from Diamond Bar and Chino Hills was problematic. In a September 1,
24 2017 letter from Mr. Philips, as Industry City Manager, to Greg Gubman, Diamond Bar's
25 Community Development Director, he stated that Industry was submitting to the Diamond
26 Bar Planning Commission notice of the location of Tres Hermanos, the extent of its
27 acquisition (the entire property) and the purpose of the acquisition, as required by
28 Government Code Section 65402(b). However, he once again refused to state the specific
-46- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

P and primary purpose of the acquisition - the development of a major solar project - and
2 once again obscured its plans by vaguely stating that it was acquiring the property "for
3 open space, preservation, public facility or other public purposes, in compliance with
4 Government Code Section 37351 and the deed restriction that will be imposed by the

5 Oversight Board." He claimed, falsely, that "[a]t this time, the City does not have any
6 more definitive plans for the future use of Tres Hermanos."

7 124. Mr. Gubman responded to Mr. Philips in a September 13, 2017 letter.
8 He first noted that the request for general plan conformity review appeared to be untimely
9 because the Industry City Council had already approved the acquisition of Tres Hermanos.
10 He then stated that the September 1 letter failed to identify Industry's purpose in acquiring
11 the property, as required by Section 65402(b), and that "a determination as to whether
12 Industry's acquisition is consistent [with the Diamond Bar general plan] can only be made
13 if Industry identifies and provides reasonable details regarding the purpose, i.e., the use,
14. for which it is acquiring the Property." He.also pointed_out.that.the_ claim.that Industry had
15 no "definitive plans" for Tres Hermanos appeared to be contradicted by the existence and
16 terms of the Original Master Lease (Diamond Bar was still unaware of the four Master
17 Lease Amendments). He concluded that, because Industry had not specified the purpose
18 of the acquisition, the matter had not been properly "submitted" to Diamond Bar and the
19 40-day review period mandated in Government Code Section 65402 had therefore not

20 commenced.

21 125. Mr. Philips then responded to Mr. Gubman in September 21 letter
22 and made it clear that Industry had no intention of explaining its actual purpose for
23 acquiring Tres Hermanos. He asserted in conclusory terms that Industry had satisfied
24 Section 65402(b) by describing the purpose of its acquisition as "open space, preservation,
25 public facility or other public purposes, in compliance with Government Code Section
26 37351 and the deed restriction .. He further argued that Diamond Bar had no right to
27 "demand[] details of the purpose" and its 40-day review period began when his
28 September 1 letter was delivered.
-47- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

126. On, September 1, 2017, Mr. Philips sent a letter to Joann Lombardo,
2 the Chino Hills Community Development Director, requesting that the Chino Hills
3 Planning Commission conduct a general plan conformity review under Section 65402. It
4 was almost identical to his September 1, 2017 letter to Mr. Gubman.

5 127. On September 28, 2017, Ms. Lombardo responded to Mr. Philips by
6 letter. She stated that Mr. Philip's letter failed to identify the location of Tres Hermanos
7 within Chino Hills' jurisdiction and failed to identify the purpose and extent of Industry's
8 use of that portion of Tres Hermanos. She concluded that Industry's submittal did not
9 comply with Section 65402 and, therefore, "we cannot determine whether Industry's
10| proposed purchase and subsequent use of the Tres Hermanos property is for a public
11 purpose or if it conforms to the City of Chino Hills General Plan."
12 128. Mr. Philips then responded to Ms. Lombardo in an October 3, 2017
13 letter that was similar in substance to his September 21 response letter to Mr. Gubman.
14 129. At a special meeting on Octoher 9, 2017, under Agenda Items 4 and 5,
15 the Chino Hills Planning Commission considered Industry's request for general plan
16 conformity review pursuant to Section 65402(b). Attached to the Agenda was a Planning
17 Commission Agenda Report dated October 9, 2017 that reiterated and augmented the
18 discussion in Ms. Lombardo's September 28 letter and summarized Mr. Philip's inadequate
19 response. Also attached to the Agenda was a proposed resolution stating that the Planning
20 Commission denied Industry's request for general plan conformity review because (a)
21 Industry had not provided adequate information to make a conformity finding
22 determination pursuant to Section 65402(b) and (b) Industry had already approved the
23 purchase of Tres Hermanos on September 28, 2017. The Planning Commission
24 unanimously adopted that resolution.

25 130. At its meeting on October 10, 2017, under Agenda Item 6.1, the
26 Diamond Bar Planning Commission considered Industry's request for general plan
27 conformity review pursuant to Section 65402(b). Attached to the Agenda was a Planning
28 Commission Agenda Staff Report dated October 10, 2017 that reiterated and augmented
-48- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

the discussion in Mr. Gubman's September 13 letter and summarized Mr. Philip's
2 inadequate response. Following the public hearing, the Planning Commission
3  unanimously adopted a resolution finding that (a) Industry had "not provided sufficient

4 information pertaining to the purpose of the Proposed Acquisition for the Planning
5 Commission to determine whether or not the proposed acquisition is in conformance with
6 the General Plan,' (b) Industry had made "material misrepresentations to the Planning
7 Commission" as to its plans for Tres Hermanos, (c) Industry's application was untimely
8 and did not comply with Government Code Section 65402(b) and (d) because the
9 application was incomplete, the 40-day period for the Planning Commission to make a

10 general plan conformance finding had not begun to run.

11

12

13 DOF INITIALLY ELECTS TO REVIEW, THEN RECONSIDERS AND DECIDES

14 NOT TO REVIEWJ E FINAL TRES HERMANOS PSA

15 131. In the meantime, following the Oversight Board's approval of the
16 $41.65 million sale, the 8/24/17 OB PSA Resolution was amended to reduce the stated
17 purchase price to $41.65 million, and a recital was revised to state that this reduced
18 purchase price

19 represents an amount less than current value of the Property due
20 to the Property being subject to a restrictive covenant that

21 specifically limits the use of the Property to open space, public use, or preservation. The reduced purchase price is equal to
22 value determined by" the [Laurain Appraisal].

23 132. Attached to the revised 8/24/17 OB PSA Resolution was a further
24 revised Tres Hermanos PSA (the "Final Tres Hermanos PSA"), in which the purchase
25 price was reduced to $41.65 million. In addition, a new provision was added in Section 8
26 l of the Final Tres Hermanos PSA and the required grant deed attached as Exhibit C thereto,
27 stating that "[p]ursuant to Health and Safety Code Sections 34181(a) and 34193.3, Buyer's
28 [Grantee's] use of the Site and any future use of the Site shall be used for open space,
-49- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 public use, or preservation use only." Both provisions further states that the restrictive

2 covenant "will remain in effect in perpetuity" and the grant deed states that it "runs with

3 the land."

4 133. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that on
5 September 21, 2017, Ms. Schlichting, as Industry's Chief Deputy City Clerk, emailed to

6 Mr. Howard of DOF a copy of the complete, revised 8/24/17 OB PSA Resolution and the
7 Final Tres Hermanos PSA.

8 134. Around the time that DOF received the revised 8/24/17 OB PSA

9 Resolution, Mr. Casso, as both Industry City Attorney and Successor Agency counsel,
10 delivered a September 19, 2017 letter to Mr. Howard of DOF, in which Mr. Casso
11 requested that DOF allow the revised 8/24/17 OB PSA Resolution to take effect, consistent
12 with HSC Sections 34179(h)(2) and 34181(f) (i.e., that DOF not exercise its right to
13 review the Oversight Board's action). He acknowledged that the estimated value of Tres
14. Hermanos in the LRP.MP was approximately $85-122_million, but never explained how the
15 $41.65 million purchase price is consistent with the LRPMP. Instead, he claimed that the
16 term "maximizing value" is subjective, and deference is given to the legislative body (the
17 Oversight Board), so that the $41.65 million purchase price did maximize value. He also
18 asserted that the purchase price was consistent with the Laurain Appraisal, once again
19 willfully disregarding that the Laurain Appraisal assumed open space use and did not
20 contemplate the development of the major solar projects contemplated in the Original
21 Master Lease and the Master Lease Amendments (collectively, the "Master Lease"), which
22 Mr. Casso also failed to disclose, or any other public use that involved any development.
23 135. On September 25, 2017, Brian Dunham, a DOF Analyst, advised Mr.
24 Philips in an email that DOF was requesting review of the revised 8/24/17 OB PSA
25 Resolution pursuant to HSC Section 34179(h).

26 136. In a November 2, 2017 letter, Mr. Howard of DOF advised Mr.
27 Philips that DOF would take no action with respect to the revised 8/24/17 OB PSA
28 Resolution and, therefore, the Final Tres Hermanos PSA:
-50- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

[HSC] section 34191.5 (f) states actions to implement the disposition of property pursuant to an approved Long-Range
2 Property Management Plan (LRPMP) shall not require review by

3 Finance. As such, Finance is taking no action on this OB Resolution. It should be noted that pursuant to HSC section
4 341901.3, an approved LRPMP shall govern the disposition of property so any oversight board action taken related to an
5 approved LRPMP should be consistent therewith.

6
THE CITY COUNCIL 'RATIFIES"' THE FINAL TRES HERMANOS PSA 7

8 137. The Successor Agency and Industry had another, mutual problem

9 because the Oversight Board did not approve the $100 Million Tres Hermanos PSA that

10 the Successor Agency Board and the Industry City Council had approved on January 13,

11 2017. Instead, the Oversight Board formulated its own terms by reducing the purchase

12 price to $41.65 million and imposing a restrictive covenant. Chino Hills is informed and

13 believes, and thereon alleges, that in an effort to paper over the Oversight Board's

14 independent action, the Successor Agency and the City Council decided to "ratify" the

15 Final Tres Hermanos PSA approved by the Oversight Board. At back-to-back meetings on

16 September 28, 2017, the City Council (under its Agenda Item 6.1) and the Successor

17 Agency Board (under its Agenda Item 5.1) considered such "ratification."

18 138. Attached to each Agenda was a September 28, 2017 Memorandum

19 from Mr. Casso to both the City Council and Successor Agency Board. He stated that

20 "[g]iven the overwhelming concern about the preservation of Tres Hermanos, the OB

21 considered a motion imposing a deed restriction on the property as to its use by any future

22 owner, including the City of Industry, at a price of $41,650,000 that reflected the use

23 restriction." Mr. Casso made this statement despite having previously advised the

24 Oversight Board that the restrictive covenant served no purpose. Contrary to this new

25 position, however, the $41.65 million purchase price obviously did not reflect the

26 development of a public use on the property or the development of the major solar facility

27 planned by Industry and San Gabriel WP.

28

-51- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

139. No resolution to approve the proposed "ratification" was attached to
2 either of the Agendas.
140. On September 27, 2017, prior to the "ratification" hearings, Mr.
4 DeBerry, the Diamond Bar City Attorney, submitted a letter to the City Council and
Successor Agency Board in opposition. In that letter, he stated that Diamond Bar's

6 objections to the proposed approvals included the following: (a) the City Council could
7 not take action prior to the completion of general plan conformity review by the Diamond
8 Bar Planning Commission pursuant to Government Code Section 65402(b); (b) neither
9 body should take any action until DOF had completed its review of the Oversight Board's
10 action and determined whether to disapprove it; (c) that Industry's contemplated purchase
11 of the property is not for a valid municipal purpose and thus does not comply with
12 Government Code Section 37351; (d) the purchase and sale violated the LRPMP; (e) the
13 sale of Tres Hermanos for $41.65 million constituted an unconstitutional gift of public
A funds because (i) the fair market valne of the property was.at_least $100,000,000 and_(ii)
15 there was no appraisal that supported the "low ball" selling price; and (f) CEQA review
16 was required before either body could ratify the purchase and sale of the property.
17 141. Also on September 28, 2017, prior to the "ratification" hearings, Mr.
18 Hensley, the Chino Hills City Attorney, submitted a letter to the Industry City Council and
19 Successor Agency Board in opposition. In that letter, he documented at length that CEQA
20 review was required prior to the approval of the Final Tres Hermanos PSA by the City
21 Council or the Successor Agency Board and included documentary evidence that the
22 planned solar project would result in a number of significant environmental impacts,
23 including significant biological, aesthetic and cultural resource impacts, which required the
24 preparation of an EIR prior to the Oversight Board's approval of the sale. The evidence
25 included biological and cultural resource studies of Chino Hills, and Tres Hermanos in
26 particular, in connection with the update of the Chino Hills General Plan adopted in 2015,
27 as well as studies showing the harmful effects of solar arrays on wildlife and birds. The
28 letters also stated that Industry must comply with Government Code Section 65402(b) by
-52- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 requesting a general plan conformity report by the Chino Hills Planning Commission prior
2 to the City Council's approval of the Final Tres Hermanos PSA.
142. Nonetheless, at their September 28 meetings, the City Council and
4 Successor Agency Board, with virtually no discussion, each unanimously approved the
5 Oversight Board's action at the August 24 Meeting.

6

7 THE CITY COUNCIL "RATIFIES" THE MASTER LEASE

143. On May 8, 2017, Chino Hills received from Ms. Schlichting, as
9 Industry Chief Deputy Clerk, what Ms. Schlichting stated was an "executed copy of the
10 [Original Master Lease]," in response to multiple Public Records Act requests. However,
11 the copy provided omitted Exhibit "A" to the document, which was the legal description of
12 the property leased to San Gabriel WP, without which it could not be determined whether
13 the leased property included Tres Hermanos. In a subsequent May 18, 2017 email from
-1  Ms.Schlichting to-Elizabeth Calciano, the-Assistant City Attorney for Chino Hills, Ms.
15 Schlichting stated that the legal description had been "inadvertently omitted" and that a
16 copy was being sent to her by email. Diamond Bar subsequently received copies of these
17 documents for the first time.

18 144. In September 21, 2017 letter from Mr. DeBerry, the Diamond Bar

19 City Attorney, to the Industry City Council, he submitted a demand that the Industry City
20 Council correct violations of the Brown Act relating to its approval of the Master Lease.
21 He stated that (a) the City Council had unlawfully approved the Original Master Lease and
22 one or more amendments thereto in closed session under the description of threatened
23 litigation, (b) Diamond Bar had never received copies of any of the amendments, (c) the
24 Master Lease had to be approved in open session, (d) if the City Council did in fact
25 approve the Original Master Lease and any amendments in open session, to provide
26 evidence of the same, and (e) the City Council had 30 days to cure the violations pursuant
27 to Government Code Section 54960.1 or face legal action.

28

-53- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 145. In response to Mr. DeBerry's demand letter, the Industry City Council
2 attempted to cure the multiple Brown Act violations by "ratifying" the unspecified prior

3 actions it took regarding the Original Master Lease and all of the Master Lease

4 Amendments within the 30-day cure period. At its October 12, 2017 meeting, the City
5 Council considered "Ratification of Master Ground Lease with San Gabriel Valley Water
6 and Power and Amendment Nos. 1-4."

7 146. Mark Hensley, Chino Hills' City Attorney, submitted a letter to the

8 Industry City Council on October 11, 2017 objecting to the proposed "ratification" of the
9 Master Lease. In that letter, he documented at length that CEQA review was required
10 prior to the approval of the Mäster Lease by the City Council and included documentary

11 evidence that the planned solar project would result in a number of significant
12 environmental impacts, including significant biological, aesthetic and cultural resource
13 impacts, which required the preparation of an EIR prior to the City Council's approval of
14-the Master Lease. The exidence included biological and cultural resource studies of Chino
15 Hills, and Tres Hermanos in particular, in connection with the update of the Chino Hills
16 General Plan adopted in 2015, as well as studies showing the harmful effects of solar

17 arrays on wildlife and birds. The letter also stated that Industry must comply with
18 Government Code Section 65402(b) by requesting a general plan conformity report by the
19 Chino Hills Planning Commission prior to City Council's approval of the Master Lease.

20 147. Diamond Bar also submitted a letter on October 11, 2017 to the
21 Industry City Council, objecting to the proposed "ratification" of the Master Lease, stating
22 that (a) the proposed ratification was in fact a new approval, (b) the Master Lease was a
23 project under CEQA, so its environmental impacts must be studied, noting that Industry
24 has spent over $10 million on consultants to further the goal of the solar project and the
25 Master Lease commits Industry to a solar project, (c) Industry must comply with
26 Government Code Section 65402(b) by obtaining a general plan conformity report from
27 the Diamond Bar Planning Commission prior to approving the Master Lease.

28

-54- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

F

1 148. Attached to the Agenda for the October 12, 2017 City Council
2 meeting was a very brief Memorandum dated October 12, 2017 from Mr. Philips, the City
3 Manager, to the City Council. He stated that "City Staff is recommending that the City

4 Council ratify the [Original Master] Lease and the related amendments that were
5 previously executed by the City Manager at the direction of the City Council." He did not
6 state the reason for that recommendation and also notably did not state that the City
7 Council had approved the Original Master Lease or any of the Master Lease Amendments.

8 149. Attached as exhibits to Mr. Philips' Memorandum were copies of the
9 signed Original Master Lease and each Master Lease Amendment. The copy of the
10 Original Master Lease was different from the copy previously received by Chino Hills in
11 May 2017. The May 2017 copy stated "Dechert draft 5/8/16" in the upper right-hand
12 corner on the first page and had a network code of "22195068.10" in the lower left-hand
13 corner, while the copy attached to the October 12, 2017 Memorandum stated "Execution
14-Copy" in-the-upper right-hand corner on the-first-page and-had-a-network-code-of
15 "22195068.14" in the lower left-hand corner. The text was also modified in several
16 respects and the October 12, 2017 copy included the Exhibit A legal description, while the
17 May 2017 copy did not. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that
18 Industry materially modified the Original Master Lease after it was executed in May 2016
19 and attached the original signature pages and signed notary forms to the modified
20 document.

21 150. Prior to reviewing the Agenda package, neither Diamond Bar nor
22 Chino Hills had ever seen copies of any of the four Master Lease Amendments,
23 notwithstanding that they had, for months, requested copies of the entire Master Lease and
24 all agreements between Industry and San Gabriel WP pursuant to Public Records Act
25 requests.

26 151. At its October 12, 2017 meeting, the lone Councilmember who
27 spoke was Councilmember Newell Ruggles, whose frustration boiled over because he
28

-55- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

M knew as little about Industry's plans for Tres Hermanos as the general public, and the
2 following dialogue occurred that involved Mr. Philips, the City Manager:
3 Councilmember Ruggles: This lease we've been working with
4 San Gabriel Valley Water and Power for over a year now? I have not... received any updates of the scope of the project. I haven't
5 seen any plans, I haven't seen rendering, layouts, cost analysis, nothing on paper. Just every time you talk to us, you say, oh, we 6 need more money, we need more money. Now we're at $20
7 million, taxpayer dollars. I haven't seen anything. Why should we continue on with this project? And we're being kept in the dark
by city staff.
Philips: we don't have any preliminary data .. a Councilmember Ruggles: I've learned more about this project in
10 newspapers than I've learned at Council meetings. Philips: That's true, but they're crafting it in a different way a and 11 in a different light.
12 Councilmember Ruggles: So you think it's fiduciary to keep amending, $20 million, and not telling anything about the project?
13 Philips: as long as the billings are justified and go through the Council
14 Councilmember Ruggles: Su I have to make a records Tequest to
15 get that information?

16 152. The City Council then voted 4-0 to approve the Master Lease, with
17 Councilmember Ruggles abstaining.
18

19 PROCEDURAL ALLEGATIONS
20 153. Chino Hills has exhausted all available administrative remedies
21 required to be pursued by it.

22 154. Chino Hills has no plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary
23 course of law, other than the relief sought in this Petition, that will prevent Industry, the
24 City Council, the Successor Agency, the Successor Agency Board and the Oversight Board
25 from acting outside their legal authority. Chino Hills has a beneficial interest in the
26 outcome in this action and has performed all conditions precedent to the filing of this
27 Petition, including mailing of the formal written notice attached hereto as Exhibit 1 and
28| incorporated herein by this reference.
-56- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

2 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

3 (Writ of Mandate - Violation of CEQA Relating to Failure to Conduct
4 Environmental Review With Respect to Master Lease - Against Industry and
5 Industry City Council)

6 155. Chino Hills repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 154, above,
7 and incorporates them herein by this reference as though set forth in full.

8 156. The State Office of Planning and Research has promulgated
9 guidelines to implement CEQA. 14 Cal. Code Regs. §§ 15000 et seq. (the "Guidelines").
10 157. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that
11 Industry and the City Council did not carry out environmental review under CEQA or
12 certify or adopt a CEQA document with respect to the Master Lease prior to the City
13 Council's approval of the Master Lease.

14 _158CEQA generally applies to "discretionary projects proposed to he..
15 carried out or approved by public agencies . . .." Cal. Pub. Res. Code § 21080(a). Before
16 granting any approval of a project subject to CEQA, every lead agency or responsible
17 agency shall consider a final EIR or negative declaration. Guidelines § 15004(a).
18 159. The appropriate CEQA document should be prepared "as early as
19 feasible in the planning process to enable environmental considerations to influence
20 project program and design and yet late enough to provide meaningful information for
21 environmental assessment." Guidelines § 15004(b).

22 160. Under CEQA, a "project" means "an activity which may cause either
23 direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical
24 change in the environment, and which is any of the following: (a) [a]n activity directly
25 undertaken by any public agency" or "(c) [a]n activity that involves the issuance to a

26 person of a lease, permit or other entitlement for use by one of more public agencies." Cal.
27 Pub. Res. Code § 21065; see also Guidelines § 15378(a). The term "project" refers to the
28 activity which is being approved and which may be subject to several discretionary
-57- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 approvals by governmental agencies. The term "project" does not mean each separate
2 governmental approval. Guidelines § 15378(c). §

3 161. The "approval" of a project is a decision by a public agency which
4 commits the agency to a definite course of action in regard to a project. Legislative action
5 in regard to a project often constitutes approval. Guidelines § 15352(a). With private
6 projects, approval occurs upon the earliest commitment to issue or the issuance by the
7 public agency of a discretionary contract, grant, subsidy, loan, or other form of entitlement
8 for use of the project. Guidelines § 15352(b).

9 162. Based on the statutory provisions and guidelines set forth in the five
10| preceding paragraphs, the City Council's approval of the Master Lease constituted the
11 "approval" of a "project", as follows:
12 a. The City Council is the legislative body of Industry, and it
13 approved the Master Lease, which includes the Original Master Lease and all of the Master
14 Lease Amendments, which_constitute discretionary actions._
15 b. The City Council's approval of the Master Lease may cause
16 either a direct physical change or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the
17 environment, as follows:

18 i The Master Lease (A) authorizes the development of a
19 photovoltaic solar project on Tres Hermanos and other portions of the Total Site with an
20 aggregate of at least 450 megawatts of rated annual output, (B) authorizes project leases
21 with terms of up to 65 years to facilitate the development of solar projects, (C) states that
22 Industry's right to terminate the Master Lease expires upon completion of one or more
23 solar photovoltaic projects that produce an aggregate of at least 50 megawatts per year, (D)
24 requires that, if Industry approves a solar project, it shall contribute 50% of the required
25 capital expenditures (net of indebtedness), construct and pay for required infrastructure and
26 pay for 50% of cost overruns, and (E) requires Industry to reimburse San Gabriel WP for
27 its pre-development costs for solar projects in the maximum aggregate amount of
28 $20 million.

-58- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

ii. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon
2 alleges, that at the time the City Council approved the Master Lease, there was meaningful

3 information available regarding the planned solar project sufficient to permit
4 | environmental review under CEQA, as follows:

5 iii. The Industry Consultants and the San Gabriel

6 Consultants (collectively, the "Tres Hermanos Consultants") were retained to design and
7 engineer, and prepare studies, plans and other project documents, conduct environmental
8 review and provide legal advice with regard to, the planned solar project on Tres
9 Hermanos. Some of the Tres Hermanos Consultants began work on the solar project no
10 later than April 2016 and most or all of them commenced work by March 2017. For that
11 work, those consultants have billed at least approximately $12.6 million, which does not
12 include work performed by the San Gabriel Consultants after April 2017. Chino Hills is
13 informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that those consultants prepared detailed plans,
14 studies and other documentation regarding the planned.solar-project that provide sufficient_
15 information to permit environmental review of the solar project prior to the approval of the
16 Master Lease by the Industry City Council.
17 iv. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon
18 alleges, that not only have the Tres Hermanos Consultants prepared significant project
19 documents and information that permit the preparation of draft EIR, but a draft EIR has
20 already been prepared or is close to completion. Helix Environmental Planning was
21 retained to prepare a draft EIR for the Tres Hermanos solar project in or around October
22 2016, submitted invoices for that work in the aggregate amount of $1,222,643 by April
23 2017, and in a February 2017 invoice that a "final draft" of the draft EIR should be
24 prepared by the end of March 2017. In addition, (1) Ambient Communities began to
25 submit invoices no later than June 2016, and its responsibilities include the "total
26 environmental process, " including "EIR completion," (2) Kimley Horn began to submit
27 invoices no later than November 2016, and its responsibilities include a range of
28 environmental and biological services and geotechnical analysis "(including CEQA)", (3)
-59- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 the Downey Brand law firm began to submit invoices no later than June 2016, and its
2 responsibilities include "land use and EIR," and (4) Chino Hills is informed and believes,

3 and thereon alleges, that several other Tres Hermanos Consultants were retained in part to
4 assist with the preparation of the draft EIR.

5 V. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon
6 alleges, that Industry had access to all of the project documents prepared by the Tres
7 Hermanos Consultants.

8 C. The City Council's approval of the Master Lease, viewed in
light of all the surrounding circumstances, committed Industry to a definite course of

10 action, as follows:

11 i. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon
12 alleges, that (A) in or around early 2015, Industry decided that it wanted to acquire Tres
13 Hermanos in order to develop a large solar facility on the property, and (B) for that reason,
14 the Successor Agency (which is the alter ego of Industry) refused to respond to or
15 acknowledge GH America's repeated offers to purchase Tres Hermanos for $101-108
16 million for residential development.

17 ii. In or around April 2016, prior to the execution of the

18 Original Master Lease, Industry and San Gabriel WP covertly assembled and put to work
19 the Tres Hermanos Consultants to design and engineer, and prepare studies, plans and
20 project documents, conduct environmental review and provide legal advice with regard to,
21 the planned solar project. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that
22  (A) Industry has reimbursed San Gabriel WP the minimum amount of approximately
23 $8,803,123 for the collective services of the San Gabriel Consultants from April 1, 2016
24 through in or around April 2017 with respect to the solar project, and (B) Industry paid the
25 Industry Consultants the minimum amount of approximately $3,848,516 for their
26 collective services from April 1, 2016 through in or around September 2017 relating to the
27 solar project.

28

-60- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

iii. In November 2016, a San Gabriel WP attorney prepared
2 the draft Power Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which SGV Solar ProjectCo 1, LLC,
3 which Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, is affiliated with San
4 Gabriel WP, would agree to develop, construct, own, operate and maintain a solar a
5 photovoltaic electric generation facility with a designed output of 135 megawatts on Tres
6 Hermanos, and to sell the electricity produced by the solar facility to the IPUC.
7 iv. Industry and the Successor Agency manipulated the
8 appraisal and sale processes to allow Industry to purchase Tres Hermanos from the
9 Successor Agency for only $41.65 million, when its fair market value is at least $100
10 million, in order to provide additional funds to develop the planned solar project, as Paul
11 Philips stated at the August 24, 2017 Oversight Board meeting.
12 V. The City Council, the Successor Agency Board and the
13 Oversight Board all approved the Final Tres Hermanos PSA, with a purchase price of
1.4 $41 65 million

15 d. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that
16 Industry and the Successor Agency rigorously concealed the existence of the planned solar
17 project and the many steps they have taken to move the solar project forward, in part to
18 avoid CEQA review for the solar project prior to the approval of the Master Lease, as
19 follows:

20 .r The City Council did not approve the Original Master
21 Lease or any of the Master Lease Amendments in open session at a public meeting prior to
22 October 12, 2017, and never otherwise disclosed the existence of the Original Master
23 Lease to the public or governmental authorities until it provided drafts of that document to
24 Chino Hills in response to Public Records Act requests, and even then did not provide to
25 Chino Hills (A) a copy of the complete, final Original Master Lease or (B) copies of any of
26 the Master Lease Amendments.

27 ii. Industry and Successor Agency officials (who are the
28 same individuals with different titles) repeatedly indicated or suggested that Tres
-61- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

•

1 Hermanos would be used solely for open space and recreational purposes, while Industry
2 was spending millions of dollars to cause the development of a major solar facility.

3 iii. Industry and Successor Agency officials concealed the

4 existence of the planned solar project from the Oversight Board and, when its existence
5 was revealed, failed to provide any documentation or information to the Oversight Board
6 regarding the solar project.

7 iv. Industry officials refused and/or failed to provide
8 meaningful documentation or information regarding the planned solar project to at least
9 some of the Industry City Councilmembers, to the point that Councilmember Ruggles
10 (who is also a member of the Successor Agency Board) publicly stated at the City Council

11 meeting on October 12, 2017 that "I haven't seen any plans, I haven't seen rendering,
12 layouts, cost analysis, nothing on paper," and asked aloud whether he had to file a Public
13 Records Act request to obtain any meaningful information regarding the solar project.
14 V. Industry officials omitted all of the invoices from the
15 San Gabriel Consultants from the monthly "register of demands" it provided to, and
16 approved by, the City Council.

17 vi. When Industry belatedly requested general plan
18 conformity review from Diamond Bar and Chino Hills in early September 2017, it still
19 refused to state the specific and primary purpose of the acquisition - the development of a
20 | major solar project - and once again obscured its plans by vaguely stating that it was
21 acquiring the property "for open space, preservation, public facility or other public
22 purposes . . . ." When both cities pushed back and requested information regarding the
23 specific purpose of the acquisition, Industry aggressively responded that neither city had

24 any right to "demand details of the purpose" and still refused to acknowledge the existence
25 of the planned solar project.

26 vii. Despite numerous Public Records Act request submitted
27 by Diamond Bar and Chino Hills to Industry requesting all documents relating to the
28 planned solar project, neither Diamond Bar nor Chino Hills has received any documents
-62- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 relating to the design, engineering, layout or schedule for the project (other than copies of
2 invoices and consultant proposals and lists) or any plans, graphics, reports, studies or
3 environmental documents prepared in connection with the project.

4 163. For these reasons, Industry and the City Council failed to carry out the
5 environmental review and certify or adopt CEQA document with respect to the Master
6 Lease that is mandated by CEQA and the Guidelines.
7 164. The failure of Industry and the Industry City Council to carry out

8 environmental review under CEQA and certify or adopt a CEQA document with respect to
the Master Lease prior to the City Council's approval of the Master lease constituted a
10 prejudicial abuse of discretion because Industry and the City Council failed to proceed in
11 the manner required by law.
12 WHEREFORE, Chino Hills prays for relief as set forth below.

13 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

14 (Writ of Mandate - Violation of CEQA Relating to Failure to Conduct

15 Environmental Review With Respect to Final Tres Hermanos PSA - Against
16 Successor Agency, Successor Agency Board and Oversight Board )
17 165. Chino Hills repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 154 and 156
18 through 161, above, and incorporates them herein by this reference as though set forth in
19 full.

20 166. The Oversight Board did not carry out any environmental review
21 under CEQA or certify or adopt a CEQA document with respect to the Final Tres
22 Hermanos PSA prior to its approval of the Final Tres Hermanos PSA.

23 167. The Successor Agency and the Successor Agency Board did not carry
24 out any environmental review under CEQA or certify or adopt a CEQA document with
25 respect to the Final Tres Hermanos PSA prior to the Successor Agency Board's approval of
26 the Final Tres Hermanos PSA.

27 168. Based on the statutory provisions and guidelines set forth in
28 paragraphs 156 through 161, above, the approval of the Final Tres Hermanos PSA by the
-63- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Oversight Board and the Successor Agency Board each constituted the discretionary
2 "approval" of a "project", as follows:

3 a. The approval of the Final Tres Hermanos PSA by the

4 Oversight Board and the Successor Agency Board may cause either a direct physical
5 change or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment, as

6 follows:

7 i. Industry seeks to acquire Tres Hermanos for the
8 development of a large solar facility on the property.
9 ii. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon
10 alleges, that at the time the Oversight Board and the Successor Agency Board approved the
11 Final Tres Hermanos PSA in August-September 2017, there was meaningful information
12 available regarding the planned solar project to permit environmental review under CEQA,
13 as follows:

14 The Tres Hermanos Consultants were retained to_
15 design and engineer, and prepare studies, plans and other project documents, conduct
16 environmental review and provide legal advice with regard to, the planned solar project on

17 Tres Hermanos. Some of the Tres Hermanos Consultants began work on the solar project
18 no later than April 2016 and most or all of them commenced work by March 2017. For
19 that work, those consultants have billed at least approximately $12.6 million, which does
20 not include work performed by the San Gabriel Consultants after April 2017. Chino Hills
21 is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that those consultants prepared detailed
22 plans, studies and other documentation regarding the planned solar project that provide
23 sufficient information to permit environmental review of the solar project prior to the
24 approval of the Final Tres Hermanos PSA by the Oversight Board and the Successor
25 Agency Board.
26 B. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon
27 alleges, that not only have the Tres Hermanos Consultants prepared significant project
28 documents and information that permit the preparation of draft EIR, but a draft EIR has
-64- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

2 retained to prepare a draft EIR for the Tres Hermanos solar project in or around October
3 2016, submitted invoices for that work in the aggregate amount of $1,222,643 by April
4 2017, and in a February 2017 invoice that a "final draft" of the draft EIR should be
5 prepared by the end of March 2017. In addition, (1) Ambient Communities began to
6 submit invoices no later than June 2016, and its responsibilities include the "total
7 environmental process," including "EIR completion," (2) Kimley Horn began to submit
8 invoices no later than November 2016, and its responsibilities include a range of

9 environmental and biological services and geotechnical analysis "(including CEQA)", (3)
10 the Downey Brand law firm began to submit invoices no later than June 2016, and its
11 responsibilities include "land use and EIR," and (4) Chino Hills is informed and believes,
12 and thereon alleges, that several other Tres Hermanos Consultants were retained in part to
13 assist with the preparation of the draft EIR.

14 ......Ç._Chino Hills-is-informed and believes, and thereon-
15 alleges, that the Successor Agency had access to all of the project documents prepared by
16 the Tres Hermanos Consultants and was obligated to make those documents available to
17 the Oversight Board.

18 b. The approval of the Final Tres Hermanos PSA by the
19 Oversight Board and the Successor Agency Board, viewed in light of all the surrounding
20 circumstances, committed the Successor Agency and the Oversight Board to a definite

21 course of action, as follows:

22 i. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon
23 alleges, that (A) in or around early 2015, Industry decided that it wanted to acquire Tres
24 Hermanos in order to develop a large solar facility on the property, and (B) for that reason,
25 the Successor Agency (which is the alter ego of Industry) refused to respond to or
26 acknowledge GH America's repeated offers to purchase Tres Hermanos for $101-108
27 million for residential development.

-65- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 ii. In or around April 2016, prior to the execution of the
2 Original Master Lease, Industry and San Gabriel WP covertly assembled and put to work
3 the Tres Hermanos Consultants to design and engineer, and prepare studies, plans and

4 project documents, conduct environmental review and provide legal advice with regard to,

5 the planned solar project. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that

6 (A) Industry has reimbursed San Gabriel WP the minimum amount of approximately
7 $8,803,123 for the collective services of the San Gabriel Consultants from April 1, 2016

8 through in or around April 2017 with respect to the solar project, and (B) Industry paid the
9 Industry Consultants the minimum amount of approximately $3,848,516 for their
10 collective services from April 1, 2016 through in or around September 2017 relating to the

11 solar project.

12 iii. In May 2016 (approximately 15-16 months before the
13 Oversight Board and the Successor Agency Board approved the Final Tres Hermanos
14 PS.A), the Industry City Council (whose-members also comprise the-Successor-Agency
15 Board) purported to approve the Original Master Lease, which, as amended, (A) authorizes
16 the development of a photovoltaic solar project on Tres Hermanos and other portions of
17 the Total Site with an aggregate of at least 450 megawatts of rated annual output, (B)
18 authorizes project leases with terms of up to 65 years to facilitate the development of solar
19 projects, (C) states that Industry's right to terminate the Master Lease expires upon
20  completion of one or more solar photovoltaic projects that produce an aggregate of at least

21 50 megawatts per year, (D) requires that, if Industry approves a solar project, it shall
22 contribute 50% of the required capital expenditures (net of indebtedness), construct and
23 pay for required infrastructure and pay for 50% of cost overruns, and (E) requires Industry
24  to reimburse San Gabriel WP for its pre-development costs for solar projects in the
25 maximum aggregate amount of $20 million. The City Council also purported to approve
26 all four of the Master Lease Amendments prior to the approval of the Final Tres Hermanos
27 PSA by the Oversight Board and the Successor Agency Board.

28

-66- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

iv. In November 2016, a San Gabriel WP attorney prepared
2 the draft Power Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which SGV Solar ProjectCo 1, LLC,
3 | which Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, is affiliated with San

4 Gabriel WP, would agree to develop, construct, own, operate and maintain a solar a
5 photovoltaic electric generation facility with a designed output of 135 megawatts on Tres
6 Hermanos, and to sell the electricity produced by the solar facility to the IPUC.

7 V. Industry and the Successor Agency manipulated the
8 appraisal and sale processes to allow Industry to purchase Tres Hermanos from the
9 Successor Agency for only $41.65 million, when its fair market value is at least
10 $100 million, in order to provide additional funds to develop the planned solar project, as
11 Paul Philips stated at the August 24, 2017 Oversight Board meeting.
12 vi. The Successor Agency Board, the Oversight Board and
13 the Industry City Council all approved the Final Tres Hermanos PSA, with a purchase
...14 price of $41.65 million.

15 C. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that
16 the Successor Agency and Industry rigorously concealed the existence of the planned solar
17 project and the many steps they have taken to move the solar project forward, in part to
18 avoid CEQA review for the solar project prior to the transfer of Tres Hermanos from the
19 Successor Agency to Industry, as follows:
20 i. The City Council did not approve the Original Master
21 Lease or any of the Master Lease Amendments in open session at a public meeting prior to
22 October 12, 2017, and never otherwise disclosed the existence of the Original Master
23 Lease to the public or governmental authorities until it provided drafts of that document to
24| Chino Hills in response to Public Records Act requests, and even then did not provide to
25 Chino Hills (A) a copy of the complete, final Original Master Lease or (B) copies of any of
26 the Master Lease Amendments.

27 ii. Industry and Successor Agency officials (who are the
28 same individuals with different titles) repeatedly indicated or suggested that Tres
-67- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

Y

Hermanos would be used solely for open space and recreational purposes, while Industry
2 was spending millions of dollars to cause the development of a major solar facility.
3 iii. Industry and Successor Agency officials concealed the
existence of the planned solar project from the Oversight Board and, when its existence
was revealed, failed to provide any documentation or information to the Oversight Board

6 regarding the solar project.

7 V. Industry officials refused and/or failed to provide
8 meaningful documentation or information regarding the planned solar project to at least
9 some of the Industry City Councilmembers, to the point that Councilmember Ruggles
10 (who is also a member of the Successor Agency Board) publicly stated at the City Council
11 meeting on October 12, 2017 that "I haven't seen any plans, I haven't seen rendering,
12 layouts, cost analysis, nothing on paper," and asked aloud whether he had to file a Public
13 Records Act request to obtain any meaningful information regarding the solar project.
14 Industry-officials-emitted-all-of the invoiees from-the
15 San Gabriel Consultants from the monthly "register of demands" it provided to, and
16 approved by, the City Council.
17 vii. When Industry belatedly requested general plan
18 conformity review from Diamond Bar and Chino Hills in early September 2017, it still
19 refused to state the specific and primary purpose of the acquisition - the development of a
20 major solar project - and once again obscured its plans by vaguely stating that it was
21 acquiring the property "for open space, preservation, public facility or other public
22 purposes ...." When both cities pushed back and requested information regarding the
23 specific purpose of the acquisition, Industry aggressively responded that neither city had
24 any right to "demand details of the purpose" and still refused to acknowledge the existence
25 of the planned solar project.
26 169. For these reasons, the Successor Agency, the Successor Agency
27 Board and the Oversight Board failed to carry out the environmental review and certify or
28

-68- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 adopt a CEQA document with respect to the Final Tres Hermanos PSA that is mandated by
2 CEQA and the Guidelines.

3 170. The failure of the Successor Agency, the Successor Agency Board

4 and the Oversight Board to carry out environmental review under CEQA and certify or
5 adopt a CEQA document with respect to the Final Tres Hermanos PSA prior to approval of
6 the Final Tres Hermanos PSA by the Oversight Board and the Successor Agency Board
7 constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion because the Oversight Board, the Successor
8 Agency and the Successor Agency Board failed to proceed in the manner required by law.

9 WHEREFORE, Chino Hills prays for relief as set forth below.

10 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

11 (Writ of Mandate - Violation of CEQA Relating to Failure to Conduct
12 Environmental Review With Respect to Final Tres Hermanos PSA - Against

13 Industry and Industry City Council)
14 171.Chino Hills repeats and realleges paragraphs_1 through_154 and 156_
15 through 161, above, and incorporate them herein by this reference as though set forth in
16 full.

17 172. Industry and the Industry City Council did not carry out any
18 environmental review under CEQA or certify or adopt a CEQA document with respect to
19 the Final Tres Hermanos PSA prior to its approval by the City Council.
20 173. Based on the statutory provisions and guidelines set forth in

21 paragraphs 156 through 161, above, the City Council's approval of the Final Tres
22 Romano's PSA constituted the discretionary "approval" of a "project", as follows:

23 a. The City Council is the legislative body of Industry and it
24 approved the Final Tres Hermanos PSA.

25 b. The City Council's approval of the Final Tres Hermanos PSA
26 may cause either a direct physical change or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical
27 change in the environment, as follows:

28

-69- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

i. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon
2 alleges, that Industry seeks to acquire Tres Hermanos for the development of a large solar

3 facility on the property.

4 ii. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon
5 alleges, that at the time the City Council approved the Final Tres Hermanos PSA on
6 September 28, 2017, there was meaningful information available regarding the planned
7 solar project to permit environmental review under CEQA, as follows:

8 iii. The Tres Hermanos Consultants were retained to design

9 and engineer, and prepare studies, plans and other project documents, conduct
10 environmental review and provide legal advice with regard to, the planned solar project on
11 Tres Hermanos. Some of the Tres Hermanos Consultants began work on the solar project
12 no later than April 2016 and most or all of them commenced work by March 2017. For
13 that work, those consultants have billed at least approximately $12.6 million, which does
14 -not include work-performed by the San_GabrieLConsultants-after_April-2017 Chino Hills

15 is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that those consultants prepared detailed
16 plans, studies and other documentation regarding the planned solar project that provide
17 sufficient information to permit environmental review of the solar project prior to the City
18 Council's approval of the Final Tres Hermanos PSA.

19 iv. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon
20 alleges, that not only have the Tres Hermanos Consultants prepared significant project

21 documents and information that permit the preparation of draft EIR, but a draft a EIR has
22 already been prepared or is close to completion. Helix Environmental Planning was
23 retained to prepare a draft EIR for the Tres Hermanos solar project in or around October
24 2016, submitted invoices for that work in the aggregate amount of $1,222,643 by April
25 2017, and in a February 2017 invoice that a "final draft" of the draft EIR should be
26 prepared by the end of March 2017. In addition, (1) Ambient Communities began to
27 submit invoices no later than June 2016, and its responsibilities include the "total

5 and thereon alleges, that several other Tres Hermanos Consultants were retained in part to
6 assist with the preparation of the draft EIR.

7 V. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon
8 alleges, that Industry had access to all of the project documents prepared by the Tres
9 Hermanos Consultants.

10 C. The City Council's approval of the Final Tres Hermanos PSA,
11 viewed in light of all the surrounding circumstances, committed the Successor Agency and
12 the Oversight Board to a definite course a of action, as follows:

13 i. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon
-14 -alleges, that (A.) in or around early 2015, Industry decided that it wanted to-acquire Tres -
15  Hermanos in order to develop a large solar facility on the property, and (B) for that reason,
16 the Successor Agency (which is the alter ego of Industry) refused to respond to or
17 acknowledge GH America's repeated offers to purchase Tres Hermanos for
18 $101-108 million for residential development.

19 ii. In or around April 2016, prior to the execution of the
20 Original Master Lease, Industry and San Gabriel WP covertly assembled and put to work

21 the Tres Hermanos Consultants to design and engineer and prepare studies, plans and
22  project documents, conduct environmental review and provide legal advice with regard to,
23 the planned solar project. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that
24 (A) Industry has reimbursed San Gabriel WP the minimum amount of approximately
25 $8,803,123 for the collective services of the San Gabriel Consultants from April 1, 2016
26 through in or around April 2017 with respect to the solar project, and (B) Industry paid the
27 Industry Consultants the minimum amount of approximately $3,848,516 for their

28

-71- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 collective services from April 1, 2016 through in or around September 2017 relating to the
2 solar project.
3 iii. In May 2016 (approximately 15-16 months before the
4 Oversight Board and the Successor Agency Board approved and ratified the Final Tres
5 Hermanos PSA), the Industry City Council purported to approve the Original Master
6 Lease, which, as amended, (A) authorizes the development of a photovoltaic solar project
7 on Tres Hermanos and other portions of the Total Site with an aggregate of at least 450
8 megawatts of rated annual output, (B) authorizes project leases with terms of up to 65

9 years to facilitate the development of solar projects, (C) states that Industry's right to
10 terminate the Master Lease expires upon completion of one or more solar photovoltaic
11 projects that produce an aggregate of at least 50 megawatts per year, (D) requires that, if
12 Industry approves a solar project, it shall contribute 50% of the required capital
13 expenditures (net of indebtedness), construct and pay for required infrastructure and pay
14 for 50% of cost overruns, and (E) requires Industry to reimburse San Gabriel WP for its.
15 pre-development costs for solar projects in the maximum aggregate amount of
16 $20 million. The City Council also purported to approve all four of the Master Lease
17 Amendments prior to the approval and ratification of the Final Tres Hermanos PSA by the
18 Oversight Board and the Successor Agency Board.
19 iv. In November 2016, a San Gabriel a WP attorney prepared
20 the draft Power Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which SGV Solar ProjectCo 1, LLC,
21 which Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, is affiliated with San
22 Gabriel WP, would agree to develop, construct, own, operate and maintain a solar
23 photovoltaic electric generation facility with a designed output of 135 megawatts on Tres
24 Hermanos, and to sell the electricity produced by the solar facility to the IPUC.
25 V. Industry and the Successor Agency manipulated the
26 appraisal and sale processes to allow Industry to purchase Tres Hermanos from the
27 Successor Agency for only $41.65 million, when its fair market value is at least $100

2 Philips stated at the August 24, 2017 Oversight Board meeting.
vi. The Successor Agency Board, the Oversight Board and
4 the City Council all approved the Final Tres Hermanos PSA, with a purchase price of

5 $41.65 million.

6 d. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that
7 the Successor Agency and Industry rigorously concealed the existence of the planned solar
8 project and the many steps they have taken to move the solar project forward, in part
9

18 Chino Hills (A) a copy of the complete, final Original Master Lease or (B) copies of any of
19 the Master Lease Amendments.

20 ii. Industry and Successor Agency officials (who are the
21 same individuals with different titles) repeatedly indicated or suggested that Tres
22 Hermanos would be used solely for open space and recreational purposes, while Industry
23 was spending millions of dollars to cause the development of a major solar facility.
24 ii. Industry and Successor Agency officials concealed the

7 Records Act request to obtain any meaningful information regarding the solar project.
8 V. Industry officials omitted all of the invoices from the
9 San Gabriel Consultants from the monthly "register of demands" it provided to, and
10 approved by, the City Council.

11 vi. When Industry belatedly requested the general plan

19 of the planned solar project.
20 vii. Despite numerous Public Records Act request submitted
21 by Diamond Bar and Chino Hills to Industry requesting all documents relating to the
22 planned solar project, neither Diamond Bar nor Chino Hills has received any documents
23 relating to the design, engineering, layout or schedule for the project (other than copies of
24 invoices and consultant proposals and lists) or any plans, graphics, reports, studies or
25 environmental documents prepared in connection with the project.
26 174. For these reasons, Industry and the Industry City Council failed to
27 carry out the environmental review with respect to the Final Tres Hermanos PSA that is
28 mandated by CEQA and the Guidelines.

•

175. The failure of Industry and the City Council to carry out

8 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
9 (Writ of Mandate - Violation of Government Code Section 65402(b) - Failure to

10 Obtain a Report as to General Plan Conformity - Against Industry
11 and Industry City Council)

12 176. Chino Hills repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 154, above,
13 and incorporates them herein by this reference as though set forth in full.
14 17.7LGovernment. Code Section 6.5402(b) provides in relevant part:
15 . a city shall not acquire real property [for street, square,
16 park or other public purposes] . . ., nor construct or authorize a public building or structure, in another city .. if such other
17 city .. has adopted a general plan or part thereof and such

18 general plan or part thercof is applicable thereto, until the location, purpose and extent of such acquisition, disposition, or
19 such public building or structure have been submitted to and
reported upon by the planning agency having jurisdiction, as to
20 conformity with said adopted general plan or part thereof.

21 178. The Industry City Council's approval of both the $100 Million Tres
22  Hermanos PSA and the Final Tres Hermanos PSA violated Section 65402(b), as follows:
23 a. Industry failed to submit to either Chino Hills or Diamond Bar
24 a request for general plan conformity review, as required by Government Code
25 Section 65402(b), prior to its approval of the $100 Million Tres Hermanos PSA on January
26 13, 2017, which authorized the acquisition of Tres Hermanos.
27 b. In a February 6, 2017 letter from the Chino Hills City Council
28 to Sean Varner, General Counsel for the Oversight Board, the City Council requested that
-75- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

Industry initiate and obtain a general plan conformity determination from the Chino Hills
2 Planning Commission pursuant to Section 65402(b).

C. In an August 24, 2017 letter from Konradt Bartlam, the Chino
4 Hills City Manager, to the Oversight Board, Mr. Bartlam reiterated that Industry had failed
5 to seek a general plan conformity finding from either Chino Hills or Diamond Bar.

6 d. In an August 24, 2017 letter from Mr. DeBerry, the Diamond
7 Bar City Attorney, Mr. DeBerry stated that the Oversight Board could not approve the

8 $100 Million Tres Hermanos PSA because Industry had not previously submitted a request
9 to either Diamond Bar or Chino a Hills for a general plan conformity finding pursuant to
10 Section 65402(b), which request must include the "purpose" of the acquisition.

11 e. Industry failed to submit to either Diamond Bar or Chino Hills
12 a request for general plan conformity review, as required by Section 65402(b), prior to the
13 Oversight Board's approval of the Final Tres Hermanos PSA on August 24, 2017.

14 Industry belatedly requested general-plan-conformity review
15 from Diamond Bar and Chino Hills on September 1, 2017, but Industry still refused to
16 state the specific and primary purpose of the acquisition - the development of a major -
17 solar project - and once again obscured its plans by vaguely stating that it was acquiring
18 the property "for open space, preservation, public facility or other public purposes . ..."
19 When both cities pushed back and requested information regarding the specific purpose of
20 the acquisition, Industry aggressively responded that neither city had any right to "demand
21 details of the purpose" and again refused to acknowledge the existence of the planned solar
22 project.

23 g. After Industry declared its intention to approve the Final Tres
24 Hermanos PSA on September 28, 2017, both Mr. Hensley, the Chino Hills City Attorney,
25 and Mr. DeBerry, the Diamond Bar City Attorney, submitted September 27, 2017 letters to
26 the Industry City Council and the Successor Agency Board stating, in part, that neither the

PSA until Industry requested general plan conformity review pursuant to Section 65402(b)
2 and the review was completed.

3 h. On October 9, 2017, the Chino Hills Planning Commission

4 adopted a resolution denying Industry's request under Section 65402(b) as incomplete

5 because (i) Industry had failed to specify the purpose for which it was acquiring Tres

6 Hermanos and (ii) it was untimely because the Final Tres Hermanos PSA had already been

7 approved by the Oversight Board on September 28.
i. On October 10, 2017, the Diamond Bar Planning Commission
Q adopted a resolution denying Industry's request under Section 65402(b) because (a)
10 Industry had "not provided sufficient information pertaining to the purpose of the Proposed
11 Acquisition for the Planning Commission to determine whether or not the proposed
12 acquisition is in conformance with the General Plan," (b) Industry had made "material
13 misrepresentations to the Planning Commission" as to its plans for Tres Hermanos,
14 (c) Industry's application was untimely and did not comply with Section 65402(b) and (d)
15 because the application was incomplete, the 40-day period for the Planning Commission to
16 make a general plan conformance finding had not begun to run.
17 j. Industry failed to submit a complete request for general plan
18 conformity pursuant to Section 65402(b) to either Chino Hills or Diamond Bar regarding
19 Industry's approval of the acquisition of Tres Hermanos prior to the Industry City
20 Council's approval of the Final Tres Hermanos PSA on September 28, 2017.
21 k. The City Council approved the Final Tres Hermanos PSA on

22 September 28, 2017, well before the Chino Hills and Diamond Bar Planning Commission
23 considered and took action on October 9 and 10, 2017 with respect to Industry's requests
24| for general plan conformity review pursuant to Section 65402(b), which actions were taken
25 prior to the expiration of the 40-day review period in Section 65402(b).

26 1. Therefore, Industry failed to comply with the requirements of
27 Section 65402(b) prior to the City Council's approval of the Final Tres Hermanos PSA on
28 | September 28, 2017.

179. The approval of the $100 Million Tres Hermanos PSA by the City
2 Council on January 13, 2017 constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion because Industry
3 failed to comply with the requirements of Section 65402(b), and the requirements of

4 Section 65402(b) were not otherwise satisfied, prior to such approval, and Industry and the
5 City Council thereby failed to proceed in the manner required by law.

6 180. The approval of the Final Tres Hermanos PSA by the Industry City
7 Council on September 28, 2017 constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion because

8 Industry failed to comply with the requirements of Section 65402(b), and the requirements
of Section 65402(b) were not otherwise satisfied, prior to such approval, and Industry and

183. Under Article XVI, Section 6, with respect to disposition of
2 property, the public agency must receive fair market value and, if the sale is at less than
3 fair market value, the reduced purchase price must further a purpose for which the selling
4 agency was formed. It is not sufficient that the sale further a public purpose; it must
further a public purpose for which the selling public agency was formed.

6 184. The Successor Agency is required to sell Tres Hermanos at a
7 reasonable price in a manner to maximize its value for the benefit of the taxing entities.
8 The function of the Oversight Board is, in part, to ensure that the Successor Agency sells
9 real property in a manner that furthers the purpose for which the Legislature created such
10 agencies. The deep discounting of the purchase price by the Oversight Board and
11 Successor Agency, based on an illusory restrictive covenant, did not further any purpose
12 for which the Successor Agency was formed. As acknowledged by Mr. Philips, the intent
13  of his motion and, ultimately, the Oversight Board's action, was to reduce the cost for
14 Industry to develop the Tres Hermanos-solar-projeet.The-Sueeesser Ageney was not
15 created by the Legislature to assist in the development of solar projects; rather it was
16 created to maximize the value of Tres Hermanos. Therefore, it had no authority to sell
17 Tres Hermanos at a deeply discounted price.

18 185. Chino Hills and the other taxing entities with respect to Tres
19 Hermanos are third party beneficiaries of any sale of Tres Hermanos and, as such, have a
20| beneficial interest in ensuring that (a) the Successor Agency sells Tres Hermanos for the
21 purposes for which the Successor Agency was formed (i.e., to maximize its value) and
22 (b) the Oversight Board ensure that the Successor Agency's action is consistent with this
23 purpose. By directing and approving a sale of Tres Hermanos at a price dramatically
24 below its fair market value, the Oversight Board and Successor Agency violated the
25 California Constitution's prohibition against making gift of public funds by taking at least
26 approximately $60 million in revenue belonging to the taxing entities and putting it
27 Industry's pocket to help it develop the Tres Hermanos solar project.

PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

186. The approval of the Final Tres Hermanos PSA by the Successor
2 Agency Board and the Oversight Board constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion

3 because it resulted in an illegal gift of public funds to Industry pursuant to California

4 Constitution Article XVI, Section 6, and the Successor Agency, the Successor Agency
5 Board and the Oversight Board thereby failed to proceed in the manner required by law.

6 WHEREFORE, Chino Hills prays for relief as set forth below.

8 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

9 (Writ of Mandate - Violation of Federal Procedural Due Process - Against Oversight

10 Board)

11 187. Chino Hills repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 154, above,
12 and incorporates them herein by this reference as though set forth in full.

13 188. The due process clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States
14 Constitution provides that "[n]o person shall._._..be deprived of life, liberty, or property_
15 without due process of law." The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the

16 United States Constitution includes a similar prohibition with respect to the states and their
17 political subdivisions by providing that no state may make or enforce any law or policy
18 that would "deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law."
19 The due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments have been interpreted to
20 require that government actions and decisions comply with procedural due process
21 restraints, which include the provision of adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard
22 before a governmental deprivation of a person's life, liberty, or property. In addition,
23 procedural due process requires a fair, unbiased hearing.

24 189. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the
25 property owners and residents of Chino Hills ("Residents") have a property and/or liberty
26 interest in the Oversight Board's actions approving the Final Tres Hermanos PSA and
27 restrictive covenant because: (a) many Residents own or rent neighboring properties which
28 view Tres Hermanos, so projects that negatively impact Tres Hermanos will devalue their
-80- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

property, (b) many Residents hike on open space or enjoy parks that view Tres Hermanos
2 or drive on Grand Avenue through Tres Hermanos and the solar project will negatively
3 impact these views, (c) Residents in Chino Hills and have an interest in tax dollars

4 providing services within and by Chino Hills, (d) Residents have a liberty interest in
5, receiving notice regarding any project proposed or sale of Tres Hermanos.

6 190. The Oversight Board's actions approving the Final Tres Hermanos
7 PSA and the restrictive covenant were adjudicatory in nature in that (a) the Oversight
8 Board's review of a proposed transfer of any asset or property of a former redevelopment
9 agency must follow specific criteria and procedures, (b) such transfers are approved "at a
10 public meeting . . . . after at least 10 days' notice to the public of the specific proposed
11 actions" Cal. Health & Safety Code § 34181(f), and (c) the sale must be consistent with
12 an approved LRPMP.

13

14 -191 The Oversight Board's-approvalof the Final Tres Hermanos PSA
15 violated the preceding requirements because neither the agenda nor agenda materials for
16 the August 24 Meeting provided the public with adequate notice of the business ultimately
17 discussed and action ultimately taken by the Oversight Board.
18

19 192. The agenda description for the business to be transacted and

20 discussed was to approve the 8/24/17 OB PSA Resolution, which was part of the agenda

21 materials and provided for the sale of Tres Hermanos to Industry for the purchase price of

22 $100 million and further specified that a sale must be "aimed at maximizing value."

23 Instead, the business discussed, and the action taken at the meeting, was to sell Tres

24 Hermanos for $41.65 million and minimize its value all so Industry could have more cash

25 for its solar project.

26 b. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that

27 the meeting was conducted in a manner that further violated federal procedural due process

28 because (i) the public was, by design, given no opportunity to provide written or oral

-81- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 comments on the Oversight Board's ultimate action, (ii) Mr. Philips waited until all public

2 comment had been taken before making his motion to ensure that the public would not

3 have any notice or opportunity to comment and (iii) the Oversight Board sanctioned the

4 violation by voting on the motion without additional public comment or notice and (iv) the

5 approval of the Final Tres Hermanos PSA effectively completed the Master Ground Lease

6 and approved the solar power project; however, Oversight Board Member Mr. Philips

7 actively hid the information about the Master Ground Lease and solar power project from
8 the public so that was also a denial of due process because the Residents had no
opportunity to examine the impacts of this project on Tres Hermanos.
10 C. Therefore, the actions of the Oversight Board willfully violated
11 procedural due process rights of Residents.

12 193. The Oversight Board's approval of the Final Tres Hermanos PSA
13 constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion because it violated public notice and comment
14 requirements that are essential to comply with the federal Constitution's procedural due_
15 process requirement, and the Oversight Board thereby failed to proceed in the manner
16 required by law.

17 WHEREFORE, Chino Hills prays for relief as set forth below.

18

19 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION
20 (Writ of Mandate - Violation of California Procedural Due Process - Against
21 Oversight Board)

22

23 194. Chino Hills repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 154, above,
24 and incorporates them herein by this reference as though set forth in full. The due process
25 clause of Article I, Section 7 of the California Constitution provides that "A person may
26 not be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law or denied equal
27|| protection of the laws[.]" The due process clause has been interpreted to require that
28  government actions and decisions comply with procedural due process restraints, which
-82- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 include the provision of adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard before a
2 governmental deprivation of a person's life, liberty, or property. In addition, procedural
3 due process requires a fair, unbiased hearing.

4 195. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the
5 property owners and residents of Chino Hills ("Residents") have a property and/or liberty
6 interest in the Oversight Board's actions approving the Final Tres Hermanos PSA and
7 restrictive covenant because: (a) many Residents own or rent neighboring properties which

8 view Tres Hermanos, so projects that negatively impact Tres Hermanos will devalue their
9 property, (b) many Residents hike on open space or enjoy parks that view Tres Hermanos
10 or drive on Grand Avenue through Tres Hermanos and the solar project will negatively
11 impact these views, (c) Residents in Chino Hills and have an interest in tax dollars
12 providing services within and by Chino Hills, (d) Residents have a liberty interest in
13| receiving notice regarding any project proposed or sale of Tres Hermanos.

14 196. The Oversight Board's actions approving the Final Tres Hermanos
15 PSA and the restrictive covenant were adjudicatory in nature in that (a) the Oversight
16 Board's review of a proposed transfer of any asset or property of a former redevelopment
17 agency must follow specific criteria and procedures, (b) such transfers are approved "at a
18 public meeting .. after at least 10 days' notice to the public of the specific proposed
19 actions" Cal. Health & Safety Code § 34181(f), and (c) the sale must be consistent with
20 an approved LRPMP.
21 197. The Oversight Board's approval of the Final Tres Hermanos PSA
22 violated the preceding requirements because neither the agenda nor agenda materials for
23 the August 24 Meeting provided the public with adequate notice of the business ultimately
24 discussed and action ultimately taken by the Oversight Board. The agenda description for
25 the business to be transacted and discussed was to approve the 8/24/17 OB PSA

P taken at the meeting, was to sell Tres Hermanos for $41.65 million and minimize its value
2 all so Industry could have more cash for its solar project.

3 198. Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the
4 meeting was conducted in a manner that further violated California Constitution's
5 procedural due process because (i) the public was, by design, given no opportunity to
6 provide written or oral comments on the Oversight Board's ultimate action, (ii) Mr. Philips

7 waited until all public comment had been taken before making his motion to ensure that

8 the public would not have any notice or opportunity to comment, (iii) the Oversight Board

9 sanctioned the violation by voting on the motion without additional public comment or
10 notice and (iv). The approval of the Final Tres Hermanos PSA effectively completed the
11 Master Ground Lease and approved the solar power project; however, Oversight Board
12 Mr. Philips actively hid the information about the Master Ground Lease and solar power
13 project from the public so that was also a denial of due process because there was no
14 opportunity to examine the impacts of this project on Tres Hermanos.

15 199. Therefore, the actions of the Oversight Board willfully violated the
16 California Constitution's procedural due process rights of the Residents of Chino Hills.
17 200. The Oversight Board's approval of the Final Tres Hermanos PSA
18 constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion because it violated public notice and comment
19 requirements that are essential to comply with the California's Constitution's procedural

22 WHEREFORE, Chino Hills prays for relief as set forth below
23

24 EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION

25 (Writ of Mandate - Violation of Government Code Section 37351 - Against Industry
26 and Industry City Council)

27 201. Chino Hills repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 200, above,
28 and incorporates them herein by this reference as though set forth in full.
-84- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 202. Government Code Section 37351 provides in relevant part that "[t]he
2 legislative body may purchase, lease, exchange, or receive such ... real estate situated
3 inside or outside the city limits as is necessary or proper for municipal purposes."

4 203. The City Council's approval of the $100 Million Tres Hermanos PSA,
5 the Final Tres Hermanos PSA and the Master Lease violated Government Code Section

6 37351, as follows:

7 a. Tres Hermanos is located entirely in Diamond Bar and Chino
8 Hills, outside of Industry's geographic boundaries.

9 b. The Industry City Council approved the $100 Million Tres
10 Hermanos PSA on January 13, 2017 and approved the Final Tres Hermanos PSA on
11 September 28, 2017.

12 C. Prior to the City Council's approval of the $100 Million Tres
13 Hermanos PSA and the Final Tres Hermanos PSS, Industry executed the Original Master
-..14 Lease on May 17,.2016. The City Council subsequently approved the Master.Lease.on
15 October 12, 2017. The Master Lease includes the lease of Tres Hermanos to San Gabriel
16 WP for a term of 25 years and an annual rent of $1.00 for the lease of the Total Site. If
17 Industry acquired title to Tres Hermanos, at such time San Gabriel WP would become the
18 tenant of Tres Hermanos.

19 d. Industry desires to acquire title to Tres Hermanos for the
20 purpose set forth in the Master Lease.
21 e. The Master Lease contemplates the development of the
22 Minimum Solar Project, which would generate 450 MW of electrical capacity.

23 f. According to the 2016 Cordoba Proposal, the total electrical
24 load serviced by the IPUC is 7 MW and the total electrical load for all users within
25 Industry's geographic boundaries is 165 MW.

26 g. The Minimum Solar Project of 450 MW planned under the
27 Master Lease dramatically exceeds both the IPUC's current needs of 7 MW and total
28 electrical load of 165 MW for all users within the boundaries of Industry.
-85- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1

h. The Master Lease guarantees the payment to Industry of
2 minimum net earnings of (A) at least $2 million per year within three years after the
3 commencement of construction of the planned solar project or (B) $4 million per year
4 within 10 years after the commencement of construction. In addition, if Industry exercised

5 its right under the Master Lease to participate in a solar project with San Gabriel WP, the

6 Master Lease provides that, in exchange for Industry funding 50% of the required capital
7 expenditures and constructing required infrastructure, Industry would receive the greater of
8 (a) the fair market rental value of the land used for the solar project plus 12% of the net
9 operating income for the solar project, (b) a 6% annual return on its contribution to the
10 project or (c) 50% of the net operating income for the project plus any net extraordinary
11 gains from the sale or refinancing of the solar project.
12 i. Therefore, the central purpose of developing the Minimum
13 Solar Project, which would generate energy far in excess of Industry's needs, is to generate
_14 millions of dollars_of revenue for San Gabriel WP, a private entity, Industry (wxhich already_
15 has general fund reserves of approximately $623 million and overall reserves of
16 approximately $1.5 billion) and their respective consultants, and therefore is not a
17 necessary or proper municipal purpose under Section 37351.
18 204. Notwithstanding Industry's execution of the Master Lease (including
19 numerous amendments) and its payment of million dollars to an array of consultants
20 retained by Industry and San Gabriel WP with regard to the planned solar project(s) under
21 the Master Lease, Industry has repeatedly denied and/or refused to acknowledge that its
22 central purpose in acquiring Tres Hermanos is to develop the Minimum Solar Project of
23 450 MW.

24 205. If the City Council actually approved the $100 Million Tres
25 Hermanos PSA and the Final Tres Hermanos PSA with no underlying municipal purpose,
26 then the City Council's approval of those agreements violated Section 37351, as follows:

27 a. Tres Hermanos is located entirely in Diamond Bar and Chino
28 Hills, outside of Industry's geographic boundaries.
-86- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

b. The Industry City Council approved the $100 Million Tres
2 Hermanos PSA on January 13, 2017 and approved the Final Tres Hermanos PSA on
3 September 28, 2017.

4 C. In an effort to avoid CEQA review, and to obfuscate its actual
5 plan for Tres Hermanos, Industry has repeatedly refused to state a specific purpose for its

6 acquisition of Tres Hermanos, let alone provide any reasoning as to why the purchase is
7 for a necessary or proper municipal purpose. For example, in a September 1, 2016 letter a
8 from Industry City Manager Paul Philips to Diamond Bar's Community Development
9 Director, Mr. Philips vaguely stated that it was acquiring the property "for open space,
10 preservation, public facility or other public purposes" and that "[a]t this time, the City does
11 not have any more definitive plans for the future use of Tres Hermanos." When pressed
12 for more information, and despite specific mention of the solar project contemplated under
13 the Master Lease, Mr. Phillips steadfastly refused to identify the purpose of the acquisition.
14 d. If Industry did not have an identified necessary or proper
15 municipal purpose for the acquisition of Tres Hermanos at the time the Industry City
16 Council approved it, then the approval does not comply with Section 37351.
17 206. The City Council's approval of the $100 Million Tres Hermanos PSA,
18 the Final Tres Hermanos PSA and the Master Lease constituted prejudicial abuses of
19 discretion because those approvals violated Section 37351, in that either (a) the planned
20 solar project described in the Master Lease is not a necessary or proper municipal purpose
21  or (b) with respect to the $100 Million Tres Hermanos PSA and the Final Tres Hermanos
22 PSA, Industry has not identified any necessary or proper municipal purpose for the
23 acquisition of Tres Hermanos, and Industry and the Industry City Council therefore failed
24 to proceed in the manner required by law.

3 NINTH CAUSE OF ACTION

4 (Writ of Mandate - Violation of Public Utilities Code Section 10004 - Against

5 Industry and Industry City Council)

6 207. Chino Hills repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 206, above,
7 and incorporates them herein by this reference as though set forth in full.

8 208. Public Utilities Code Section 10004 provides that, for the purpose of
9 acquiring, constructing, owning, operating, or leasing a public utility:
10 [A] municipal corporation may acquire, own, control, sell, or

11 exchange lands, easements, licenses, and rights of every nature within or without its corporate limits, and may operate a public
12 utility within or without the corporate limits when necessary to

13 supply the municipality, or its inhabitants or any portion thereof, with the service desired.

14 209. The Industry City Council's approval of the Master Lease violated
15 Section 10004, as follows:

16 a. Tres Hermanos is located entirely in Diamond Bar and Chino
17 Hills, outside of Industry's geographic boundaries.

18 b. Industry executed the Original Master Lease on May 17, 2016.
19 The Industry City Council subsequently approved the Master Lease on October 12, 2018.
20 C. The purpose of the Master Lease is the construction and
21 operation of a solar project, as follows:

22 i. The Master Lease contemplates that Industry and San
23 Gabriel WP would develop and San Gabriel WP and/or subtenants would operate one or

24 more solar projects on Tres Hermanos that would generate 450 MW of electrical capacity.

25 ii. In November 2016, a San Gabriel WP attorney prepared
26 the draft Power Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which SGV Solar ProjectCo 1, LLC,
27 which Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, is affiliated with San
28 Gabriel WP, would (A) develop, construct, own, operate and maintain a solar photovoltaic
-88- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR

*

electric generation facility with a designed output of 135 MW on Tres Hermanos and (B)
2 sell the electricity produced by the solar facility to the IPUC.
3 d. The Master Lease is a sale or exchange of lands or rights of
4 every nature because (i) the Master Lease gives San Gabriel WP the right to occupy Tres
5 Hermanos for 25 years for $1.00 in annual rent and permits San Gabriel WP to sublease
6 portions of the Total Site to subtenants for terms of up to 65 years and (ii) in exchange for
7 such lease and potential subleases and Industry's funding of a portions of the planned solar
8 projects, Industry is guaranteed to receive significant revenue from the development of
9 those solar projects.

10 e. The Minimum Solar Project of 450 MW contemplated under
11 the Master Lease would generate energy far in excess of that required to supply Industry or
12 its inhabitants or any portion thereof with electrical service, as follows:
13 i. The Master Lease contemplates a Minimum Solar
14 Project that would_generate_45.0 M.W_of electrical-capacity
15 ii. According to the 2016 Cordoba Proposal, the total
16 electrical load serviced by the IPUC is 7 MW and the total electrical load for all users
17 within Industry's geographic boundaries is 165 MW.
18 iii. Therefore, the Minimum Solar Project of 450 MW
19 planned under the Master Lease dramatically exceeds both the IPUC's current needs of
20 7 MW and total electrical load of 165 MW for all users within the boundaries of Industry.
21 210. Industry's and the City Council's approval of the $100 Million Tres
22 Hermanos PSA and the Final Tres Hermanos PSA violated Section 10004, as follows:
23 a. Tres Hermanos is located entirely in Diamond Bar and Chino
24 Hills, outside of Industry's geographic boundaries.
25 b. The City Council approved the $100 Million Tres Hermanos
26 PSA on January 13, 2017 and approved the Final Tres Hermanos PSA on September 28,
27 2017.

1 C. Prior to the City Council's approval of the $100 Million Tres
2 Hermanos PSA and the Final Tres Hermanos PSS, Industry executed the Original Master
3 Lease on May 17, 2016. The City Council subsequently approved the Master Lease on
4 October 12, 2018. The Master Lease includes the lease of Tres Hermanos to San Gabriel
5 WP for a term of 25 years and an annual rent of $1.00 for the lease of the Total Site. If

6 Industry acquired title to Tres Hermanos, at such time San Gabriel would become the
7 tenant of Tres Hermanos.

8 d. The $100 Million Tres Hermanos PSA and the Final Tres

9 Hermanos PSA involve Industry's acquisition of Tres Hermanos.
10 e. Industry desires to acquire title to Tres Hermanos for the
11 purpose set forth in the Master Lease.
12 f. The purpose of the Master Lease is the construction and
13 operation of a public utility, as follows:
The Master-Lease-contemplates-that-Industry and-San-
15 Gabriel WP would develop and San Gabriel WP and/or subtenants would operate one or

16 more solar projects on Tres Hermanos that would generate 450 MW of electrical capacity.
17 ii. The draft Power Purchase Agreement contemplates that
18 SGV Solar ProjectCo 1, LLC, which Chino Hills is informed and believes, and thereon
19 alleges, is affiliated with San Gabriel WP, would (i) develop, construct, own, operate and
20 maintain a solar photovoltaic electric generation facility with a designed output of 135
21 MW on Tres Hermanos and (ii) sell the electricity produced by the solar facility to the
22 IPUC.

23 g. The Minimum Solar Project of 450 MW contemplated under
24 the Master Lease would generate energy far in excess of that required to supply Industry or
25 its inhabitants or any portion thereof with electrical service, as follows:
26 i. The Master Lease contemplates a Minimum Solar
27 Project that would generate 450 MW of electrical capacity.

1 ii. According to the 2016 Cordoba Proposal, the total
2 electrical load serviced by the IPUC is 7 MW and the total electrical load for all users

4 iii. Therefore, the Minimum Solar Project of 450 MW
5 planned under the Master Lease dramatically exceeds both the IPUC's current needs of
6 7 MW and total electrical load of 165 MW for all users within the boundaries of Industry.

7 211. The Industry City Council's approval of the Master Lease, the $100
8 Million Tres Hermanos PSA and the Final Tres Hermanos PSA constituted prejudicial
9 abuses because those approvals violated Section 10004, in that (a) they all involve the
10 acquisition, sale or exchange of lands or rights of every nature for the purpose of
11 constructing, owning, operating or leasing a public utility, (b) the planned solar projects
12 described in the Master Lease and other documents would produce energy that is far more
13 than necessary to supply Industry or its inhabitants or any portion thereof with electrical
14 service, and Industry and the Industry City Council therefore failed to procced in the
15 manner required by law.

16 WHEREFORE, Chino Hills prays for relief as set forth below.

Letter to Diane Schlichting
October 31, 2017
Page 2

(the "Oversight Board" and, collectively with the preceding entities, "Respondents"), relating to the contemplated sale and development of the Tres Hermanos Ranch ("Tres Hermanos"), including without limitation (1) the City Council's approval of that certain Master Ground Lease dated as of May 17, 2016, by and between Industry, as landlord, and San Gabriel Valley Water and Power, LLC ("San Gabriel WP"), as tenant, pursuant to which Industry has purported to lease to San Gabriel WP certain real property, including Tres Hermanos, for the development of solar projects (as amended, the "Master Lease"), and (2) the approval by the City Council, the Successor Agency Board and the Oversight Board of Directors of that certain Purchase and Sale Agreement and Joint Escrow Instructions - Tres Hermanos Ranch, by and between the Successor Agency, as seller, and Industry, as buyer, pursuant to which Industry would acquire Tres Hermanos for the sum of $41.65 million (the "Final Tres Hermanos PSA.").
This action will be based in part on the failure of Industry, the Successor Agency and the Oversight Board to carry out environmental review under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") with respect to the Master Lease and the Final Tres Hermanos PSA prior to their approval by the City Council, the Successor Agency Board and the Oversight Board.
The action will seek a peremptory writ of mandate to set aside the Master Lease and the Final Tres Hermanos PSA and enjoin Respondents from taking any further actions relating to the sale or lease of Tres Hermanos until Respondents have taken such actions as may be necessary to comply with the requirements of CEQA.
Petitioner will also seek as recovery the costs of the suit and attorneys' fees pursuant to Section 1021.5 of the California Code of Civil Procedure and other applicable laws.

Very truly yours,
Zalr4 Calus
Elizabeth M. Calciano
Assistant City Attorney City of Chino Hills
