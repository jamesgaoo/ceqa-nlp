PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Petitioner SMC Marijuana Moratorium Coalition brings this Petition for writ of
2 mandate ("Petition") under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") on behalf of
3 Petitioner's interested members, and in the public interest.

4 INTRODUCTION

5 1. In December 2017, Respondent County of San Mateo ("County") enacted an

6 ordinance titled, "Regulations of Commercial Cannabis in the Unincorporated Area of the County
7 of San Mateo" ("the Ordinance" or "the Project"). The Ordinance sets forth standards and
8 requirements for commercial cannabis cultivation operations in unincorporated areas of the

9 County. While one of the stated purposes of the Ordinance is to protect "the environment, water
10 supply, public health, safety, and welfare," it achieves quite the opposite. In adopting the
11 Ordinance, the County circumvented key substantive and procedural requirements of CEQA, a law
12 designed to protect public health, the environment, public participation, and government
13 accountability.

14 2. Under CEQA, the County has a duty to draft an Environmental Impact Report
15 ("EIR") if substantial evidence in the record supports a "fair argument" that the Project may have
16 one or more significant effects on the environment. Despite the record containing substantial
17 evidence supporting several fair arguments that the Ordinance will adversely impact hydrology
18 and water quality, sensitive species and habitat, air and light pollution, climate change, and other

19 effects, the County proceeded to adopt a Negative Declaration stating that the Ordinance will have
20 no significant adverse environmental effects. The County thereby sidestepped CEQA's EIR
21 requirement. The EIR requirement is at the heart of CEQA, and seeks to inform the public of a
22 proposed project's significant environmental effects, identify possible ways to minimize those
23 | effects, and describe reasonable alternatives to those projects.

24 3. The County continued to run roughshod over CEQA by failing to analyze any
25 potentially significant environmental effects of the Project, instead impermissibly deferring these
26| determinations to future analyses. The County also failed to analyze the feasibility or potentially
27 significant effects of its adopted mitigation measures, thereby depriving agencies and the public of

28

-1-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

their right to determine whether these measures will effectively mitigate adverse environmental

2 impacts.

3 4. In a clear attempt to circumvent CEQA's environmental review process, the
4 Ordinance further permits the granting of licenses to existing commercial cannabis cultivation
5 operations under the guise of a ministerial license. While CEQA exempts ministerial licenses from
6 environmental review, a closer look at the Ordinance reveals that these licenses are not wholly
7 ministerial in nature, but rather, discretionary, and should be subject to future CEQA review.

8 5. In committing these actions, the County prejudicially thwarted CEQA's statutory

9 goals, including environmental protection, informed decision-making, and informed public
10 participation.

11 6. Accordingly, Petitioner brings this action seeking a Writ of Mandate to vacate the
12 County's approval of the Project, and all approvals subsequently rendered in furtherance of the
13 Project, unless and until the County complies with CEQA.

14 THE PARTIES

15 7. Petitioner SMC MARIJUANA MORATORIUM COALITION is an association of

16 concerned citizens mobilized in response to the County's lack of responsiveness regarding
17 significant environmental concerns caused by new licensing of marijuana growing operations in
18 San Mateo County.

19 8. Respondent COUNTY OF SAN MATEO ("Respondent" or "County") is a political
20 subdivision of the State of California. The County is located in the San Francisco Bay Area on the

21 central portion of the San Francisco Peninsula, with its county seat in Redwood City. The Clerk of
22 the County Board of Supervisors is located at 400 County Center, 1st Floor, Redwood City, CA
23 94603-1663. The County approved the Ordinance on December 12, 2017. (San Mateo County
24 Board of Supervisors Meeting, Dec. 12, 2017, Agenda No. 47, File No. 16-857.)

25 9. Respondent COUNTY OF SAN MATEO, PLANNING AND BUILDING
26 DEPARTMENT is a local agency within the County of San Mateo. The PLANNING AND
27 BUILDNG DEPARTMENT is tasked with planning and regulating land use and development
28 within the unincorporated areas of the County. The PLANNING AND BUILDING

-2-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

| DEPARTMENT prepared the Negative Declaration and responses to public comments it received
2 on the Negative Declaration, and filed the Notice of Determination following County approval of
3 Project. The PLANNING AND BUILDING DEPARTMENT is headquartered at 455 County

4 Center, 2nd Floor, Redwood City, California 94063-1663.

5 10. The true names and capacities of the Respondents named here as DOES through
6 100, inclusive, are presently unknown to Petitioners. As such, Petitioners have sued these
7 Respondents by fictitious names, and Petitioner will seek to amend this Petition to show their true
8 names and capacities when ascertained.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE

10 11. This Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandate to set aside Respondents'
11 actions and decisions relating to the Ordinance and to compel Respondents to comply with CEQA

12 under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 and California Public Resources Code

13 section 21168.5.

14 12. Venue is proper in San Mateo County under California Code of Civil Procedure
15 section 393 and 401 and California Government Code section 955.3.

16 NOTICE REQUIREMENTS

17 13. The Planning Department filed a Notice of Determination regarding its certification
18 of the Negative Declaration on December 17, 2017.

19 14. Petitioners filed this action within 30 days of the filing of that Notice of
20 Determination as required by California Public Resources Code section 21167(c).

21 15. On January 10, 2018, prior to commencing this action, Petitioner provided
22 Respondents with written notice of Petitioner's intent to commence this action under CEQA, and
23 thus Petitioner has complied with the requirements of California Public Resources Code section
24  21167.5. Copies of that written notice and proof of service are attached as Exhibit A.

25 16. On January 12, 2018 Petitioner filed a notice election to prepare the record of
26 proceedings, pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6(b)(2). A copy of that notice is
27 attached as Exhibit B. Petitioner will personally serve Respondents with notice.

28

-3-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

;

17. On January 12, 2018 Petitioner provided to the Attorney General of the State of
2 California notice of the filing of this Petition and a copy thereof, and thus Petitioner has complied
3 with the requirements of California Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and California Code

4 of Civil Procedure section 388. A copy of that notice is attached as Exhibit C.

5 18. On January 12, 2018, Petitioner filed and served a Request for Hearing, and thus
6 complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.4. A copy of that notice is attached as
7 Exhibit D.

8 ADDITIONAL STANDING ALLEGATIONS

9 19. Petitioner and its respective members live in and/or use and enjoy the areas
10 included in, and that will otherwise be affected by the Project, including the air, waters, and lands

11 affected by the Project for recreational, educational, scientific, conservation, aesthetic and spiritual
12 purposes.

13 20. Petitioner and its respective members are directly and beneficially interested in
14 Respondents' mandatory duty to fully comply with CEQA, and Petitioner and its respective
15 members are directly and beneficially interested in, and aggrieved by, the acts, decisions, and
16 omissions of Respondents as alleged in this Petition.

17 21. Petitioner does not have a plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course
18 of law. Without the requested mandatory and injunctive relief, Petitioner and its respective

19 members will be irreparably harmed by implementation of the Project and by Respondents'
20 violations of CEQA. Such harm cannot be adequately compensated by money or other legal

21 remedies.

22 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

23 22. Petitioner has exhausted administrative remedies because one or more of its

24 members commented orally or in writing during the public comment period about the issues raised

25 in this action. (Pub. Resources Code. § 21177(a)-(c).)

PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE

23. Petitioners bring this action as private attorneys general pursuant to California
Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce
4 important rights affecting the public interest.

5 24. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer significant benefits on

6 the general public by, among other benefits: 1) requiring Respondents to properly analyze all
7 potentially significant effects of the Ordinance; 2) ensuring that Respondents properly analyze
8 mitigation measures to ascertain whether they will reduce or avoid the Project's potentially

9 significant, adverse environmental effects; 3) requiring Respondents to draft an EIR informing
10 agencies and the public of significant environmental effects of the Ordinance, identifying possible
11 ways to minimize those effects, and describing reasonable alternatives to those projects; and 4)
12 ensuring that any licenses to existing commercial cannabis operations are truly ministerial in
13 nature, or otherwise requiring the granting of these licenses to be subject to CEQA review.

14 25. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will result in the enforcement of
15| important rights affecting the public interest. Compelling Respondents to undertake these actions
16 would protect public health and natural resources, require Respondents to properly and publicly
17 disclose and analyze all of the Project's potentially significant, adverse environmental effects,
18 offer the public the opportunity to meaningfully comment on all aspects of the Ordinance, and
19 require Respondents to implement all feasible mitigation measures or alternatives that would
20 reduce or avoid such impacts.

21 26. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement are such as to make an award of
22 attorneys' fees appropriate in this proceeding. Absent enforcement by Petitioner, the Ordinance
23 might otherwise be deemed valid despite its legally and factually inadequate disclosures, analysis,
24 conclusions, mitigation measures, among other things, and, as a result, potentially significant,
25 adverse environmental effects might otherwise have evaded legally adequate environmental
26 review and mitigation in accordance with the California Legislature's policy, in adopting CEQA,

27 of affording the greatest protections to the environment within the scope of the statute.

28

-5-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

27. Petitioner has served a copy of this Petition on the Attorney General's office to
2 give notice of Petitioners' intent to bring this proceeding as a private attorney general under Code
3 of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, which notice attached as Exhibit C.

4 APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARDS

5 28. Enacted in 1970, CEQA imposes a statewide policy of environmental protection.
6 (See Pub. Resources Code § 21000-21177.)

7 29. CEQA's basic purpose includes: informing government decision makers and the
8 public about the potential, significant environmental effects of proposed activities; identifying

9 ways that environmental damage can be avoided or significantly reduced; and preventing
10 significant, avoidable damage to the environment by requiring changes in projects through the use

11 of alternatives or mitigation measures when the governmental agency finds the changes to be
12 feasible. (CEQA Guidelines' ("Guidelines) § 15002(a).)

13 30. When CEQA applies, the relevant governmental agency must conduct an Initial
14 Study to determine "if the project may have a significant effect on the environment." (CEQA
15 Guidelines, § 15065(a).) The CEQA Guidelines define "significant effect on the environment" as a
16 "substantial, or potentially substantial, adverse change in any of the physical conditions within the
17 area affected by the project including land, air, water, minerals, flora, fauna, ambient noise, and
18 objects of historic or aesthetic significance." (Guidelines, §§ 15360, 15382; Pub. Resources Code

19 § 21060.5)

20 31. If the Initial Study uncovers "substantial evidence that any aspect of the project,
21 either individually or cumulatively, may cause a significant effect on the environment," the agency
22 must prepare an EIR. (Guidelines, § 15063(b)(1).) An EIR is required whenever "substantial
23 evidence in the record supports a 'fair argument' significant impacts or effects may occur'

24

25

26
Courts have held that the CEQA Guidelines "are owed deference insofar as they reflect the agency's specialized
27 knowledge and expertise and were adopted through a process of notice and public comment under the California Administrative Procedure Act." (Friends of College of San Maleo Gardens v. San Mateo County Community College 28 Dist. (2016) Cal.5th 937, 954.) Thus, courts afford the Guidelines "great weight' unless a provision is *clearly unauthorized or erroneous under the statute' [citation]." (Ibid.)

-6-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

[citation]." (City of Arcadia v. State Water Resources Control Bd. (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 1392,
2 1421.)

32. If, based on the Initial Study and any public comments received, there is "no

4 substantial evidence that the project or any of its aspects may cause a significant effect on the
5 I environment," the agency prepares a Negative Declaration. (Guidelines, §§ 15063(b)(2),
6 15074(b).)

7 33. In the CEQA context, substantial evidence "means enough relevant information

8 and reasonable inferences from this information that a fair argument can be made to support a

0 conclusion, even though other conclusions might also be reached." (Guidelines, § 15384(a).)
10 Substantial evidence includes "facts, reasonable assumptions predicated upon facts, and expert
11 opinion supported by facts." (Id., subd. (b).)

12 34. Courts have consistently held that the foremost principle under CEQA is that it is to
13 be "interpreted in such a manner as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment
14 within the reasonable scope of the statutory language." (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of
15 Supervisors, (1990) 52 Cal.3d at 563- 64 [quoting, Friends of Mammoth v. Bd. of Supervisors
16 (1972) 8 Cal.3d 247, 259].) Courts further held that "[i]t is, of course, too late for a grudging,
17 miserly reading of CEQA." (Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. V. Regents of California (1988) 47
18 Cal.3d 376, 390 [citing Bozung v. Local Agency Formation Comm'n. (1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 274).)
19 An agency's action violates CEQA if it "thwarts the statutory goals" of "informed
20 decisionmaking" and "informed public participation." (Kings County. Farm Bureau v. City of
21 Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 712.)

22 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

23 35. In 2009, the San Mateo County (the "County" or "Respondent") Board of
24 Supervisors enacted Chapter 5.148 of the San Mateo County Ordinance Code, "Regulation of
25 Collective Cultivation and Distribution of Medical Marijuana," which, among other things,
26 prohibited commercial cannabis activities, including advertising, sales, and profit related to
27 cannabis.

28

-7-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

36. On November 8, 2016, California voters approved Proposition 64, which legalized
2 recreational marijuana for persons aged 21 years older. The California Legislature subsequently
3l enacted Senate Bill 94 on June 17, 2017, which amended the Health and Safety Code to permit
4 local jurisdictions to enact and enforce "reasonable regulations" to regulate commercial cannabis
5 activities. (Health & Saf. Code § 11362.2(b).) Senate Bill 94 was approved by the Governor and
6 chaptered by the Secretary of State on June 27, 2017.

7 37. Pursuant to its delegated authority under California Senate Bill 94, on December
8 13, 2016, the County Board of Supervisors enacted a temporary 45-day moratorium on: (1) all

9 commercial or industrial use involving cannabis and (2) outdoor planting, cultivation, harvesting,
10 drying, or processing of cannabis plants for nonmedical use within the unincorporated area of San
11 Mateo County.

12 38. On January 24, 2017, the Board of Supervisors voted to extend the temporary
13 moratorium until December 12, 2017. The Board of Supervisors again voted on December 5, 2017
14 to extend the temporary moratorium until December 11, 2018, and enacted another 45-day
15 temporary moratorium specifically relating to commercial medical cannabis activity.

16 39. On December 5, 2017, the County Building and Planning Department introduced a
17 resolution to the County Board of Supervisors to adopt an ordinance to repeal Chapter 5.148 of the
18 San Mateo County Ordinance Code and to replace it with a new Chapter 5.148 titled, the
19 "Regulations of Commercial Cannabis in the Unincorporated Area of the County of San Mateo"
20 (the "Ordinance").

21 40. The stated "purpose and intent" of the proposed Ordinance is to:

22 [I]mplement California State law by providing a means for the reasonable

23 regulation of cannabis cultivation in a manner that is consistent with State law and which addresses the needs and concerns of residents living within
24 the unincorporated areas of the County and the protection of the environment, water supply, public health, safety, and welfare."
25

26 (See Ordinance, § 1, Recitals.)

27

28

-8-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

41. The Ordinance only permits the issuance of business licenses for mixed-light
2 cannabis cultivation2 and nurseries and prohibits all other cannabis activities (i.e., personal and
commercial outdoor cannabis cultivation, indoor commercial cannabis cultivation, and other

4 commercial cannabis activities). Construction of new greenhouse structures for commercial

5 cannabis cultivation will be subject to future discretionary review and permitting procedures,

6 including CEQA review. Commercial cannabis cultivation operations may occur "in existing

7 greenhouses under the proposed ordinance without additional environmental review, but subject to
8 issuance of a ministerial business license," as long as the existing greenhouse does not require
9 substantial expansion. (San Mateo County Notice of Intent to Adopt Negative Declaration, File
10 No. MNA 2017-00023, at f 10.)

11 42. The County Planning and Building Department conducted an Initial Study of the
12 proposed Ordinance to determine whether to prepare a Negative Declaration or an EIR pursuant to
13 CEQA. The Initial Study did not identify any significant environmental impacts associated with
14 the adoption of the Ordinance.
15 43. The County subsequently drafted a Notice of Intent to Adopt Negative Declaration,
16 and published a proposed Negative Declaration for public review and comment from October 18.
17 2017 to November 17, 2017. Several comment letters included substantial evidence supporting :

18 fair argument that the Ordinance may have significant effects on the environment. These
19 environmental effects included:

20 (a) Effects on hydrology and water quality;

21 (b) Effects on biological resources and sensitive species and habitat;

22 (c) Effects on air pollutant emissions;

23 (d) Effects on climate change; and,

24 (e) Effects on light pollution, amongst others.

25 44. Nevertheless, the County approved the Project and Negative Declaration, and
26 proceeded to file a Notice of Determination on December 14, 2017 indicating that the Ordinance,

27 2 The Ordinance defines "Mixed-Light Cultivation" as "cultivation using light deprivation and/or any combination of 28 natural and supplemental artificial lighting. Greenhouses and similar structures are included in this category. This category does not include hoop houses or other temporary structures." (Ordinance § 5.148.020(v).)

-9-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

when adopted and implemented, would not have a significant effect on the environment. (San

2 Mateo County Board of Supervisors Meeting, Dec. 12, 2017, Agenda No. 47, File No. 16-857.)

3 45. In so doing, the County ignored fair arguments based on substantial evidence in the
4 record that the Ordinance may have significant environmental effects.

5 46. Rather than approving a Negative Declaration, the County was instead required to

6 draft an EIR because substantial evidence indicated the Ordinance may have individual and
7 cumulative significant environmental impacts. (Guidelines §15162; Pub. Resources Code §
8 21082.2(d); see also No Oil. Inc. V. Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75 [holding that an EIR is

9 required "whenever it can be fairly argued on the basis of substantial evidence that [a] project may
10 have significant environmental impact"].)

11 47. Courts have routinely held that an EIR is at "the heart of CEQA" since it informs
12 governmental agencies and the public of a project's environmental impacts. (See County of Inyo v.
13 Yorty (1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 795, 810; see also Sundstrom v. County of Mendocino (1998) 202
14 Cal.App.3d 296, 304 [stating that "the objective of the EIR is 'to compel government at all levels
15 to make decisions with environmental consequences in mind' [citations]"].) "A simple ...
16 Negative Declaration, stating that the project will have no significant environmental effect, cannot
17 service this function." (No Oil, supra, 13 Cal.3d at p. 73.) It is therefore difficult to ascertain how
18 the Ordinance can achieve its stated purpose of "protecting the environment" when the County
19 circumvented key substantive and procedural CEQA requirements, namely, the preparation of an

20 EIR.

21 48. Alternatively, at a minimum, the County should have drafted a proposed Mitigated
22 Negative Declaration incorporating mitigation measures to reduce all potentially significant
23  impacts to less than significant levels. (Cal. Pub. Resources Code § 21080(c)(2); Guidelines §
24 15070; Lighthouse Field Beach Rescue v. City of Santa Cruz (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 1170, 1171.)
25 Instead, the County incorporated mitigation measures into the Project, without holding an
26 opportunity for public review and comment, thereby circumventing CEQA review.

27 49. Finally, the County's Negative Declaration, itself, was inadequate, as it illegally
28 defers evaluation of the environmental effects of the Project to a future unknown time, while also

-10-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

P declaring such future approvals to be ministerial and therefore not subject to CEQA review.
2 Consequently, the County failed to ensure any meaningful environmental review of the effects of
3 the Project at all.

4 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

(Violations of CEQA)

6 50. Petitioner incorporates the allegations set forth above, as if fully set forth here.

7 51. The County prejudicially abused its discretion in approving the Project and
8 certifying the Negative Declaration. The County did not proceed in the manner required by law,

9 and its decisions are not supported by substantial evidence. (Pub. Res. Code § 21168.5; Vineyard
10 Area Citizens for Responsible Growth v. City of Rancho Cordova (2007) 40 Cal. 4th 412, 426.)
11 These legal deficiencies include, without limitation, the following:

12 A. Unlawfully Adopting a Negative Declaration when Substantial Evidence Indicated the Ordinance May Have Significant Effects on the Environment
13

14 52. Under CEQA, an agency may adopt a Negative Declaration "if it finds on the basis
15 of the whole record before it (including the initial study and any comments received), that there is

16 no substantial evidence that the project will have a significant effect on the environment."
17 (Guidelines, § 15074(b).) As set forth supra, the comments to the proposed Negative Declaration
18 contained substantial evidence supporting a fair argument that the Ordinance would have adverse
19 environmental effects. Rather than meaningfully assessing these effects in its Negative Declaration

20 Initial Study, the Respondents instead deferred assessment to a future study, and illegally sought

21 to incorporate mitigation measures into the Project itself without evaluating or imposing
22 mitigation measures under CEQA.

23 I. Impacts to Hydrology and Water Quality

24 53. Public comments included substantial evidence supporting a fair argument that the
25 project may have one or more significant effects on hydrology and water quality.

26 54. Several comments noted that the cultivation of cannabis requires a significant
27 amount of water in comparison to other crops ("cultivation of cannabis requires approximately
28 twice the amount of water as the cultivation of grapes," "cannabis is an extremely thirsty crop").

-11-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Commercial cannabis cultivation operations could therefore result in significant environmental
2  effects such as water table and stream drawdown, failure of wells, and exacerbation of already
3 insufficient water supplies, among others.

4 55. Current impacts to water supplies because of the recent California drought, coupled

5 with the cumulative impact of water usage for commercial cannabis operations, provide
6 substantial evidence supporting a fair argument that the proposed Ordinance may have significant
7 effects on the environment. A project is deemed to have a significant effect on the environment if

8 "the possible effects of a project are individually limited but cumulatively considerable." (Cal.

9 Pub. Res. Code § 21083.)

10 56. However, the Negative Declaration and Initial Study never assessed these effects,
11 instead deferring assessment to future studies with no CEQA review.

12 2. Impacts to Species and Habitat

13 57. Comments including the California Department of Fish and Wildlife ("CDFW")
14 also contained substantial evidence supporting a fair argument of potential significant impacts to
15 sensitive species and habitat.

16 58. Comments noted that water use for commercial cannabis cultivation could result in
17 streamflow drawdown, which could impede the movement of species. Surface and groundwater
18 withdrawals to support cannabis cultivation could individually and cumulatively impact riparian
19 and instream habitats for native species.

20 59. CDFW also noted the following in its comments:

21 a. Existing greenhouse structures may require improvement and maintenance under the

22 Ordinance, in addition to compliance with fire code requirements, which could result in

23 land disturbances that would adversely impact sensitive species and habitats;

24 b. Some greenhouses may be in remote areas that require road upgrades and maintenance.

25 CDFW staff documented numerous instances of the impacts of poor road construction

26 associated with cannabis cultivation on waterways and habitat. Even well-maintained

27 roads can significantly impact habitat for sensitive species. These impacts could lead to

28

3 significant effects on the movement of fish and wildlife and cause sediment pollution
to aquatic habitat.

C.

ur P Finally, the Biological Resources impact section of the Negative Declaration failed to

a analyze potentially significant effects to special-status species and sensitive habitat

7 types.3 One such species is the San Francisco garter snake, which is a fully protected

8 species that may not be taken or possessed at any time, except as otherwise provided in

9 Fish and Game Code sections 5050, 2081.7, and 2835. (See also Fish and Game Code
§ 5050(b)(2).)

3.

10 60. Light Pollution

The Ordinance addresses the use of lighting in greenhouses for commercial
11 cannabis cultivation. Section 5.148.160(h) of the Ordinance states:

12

13

14 All lighting shall be fully shielded, downward casting, and not spill over onto other structures, other properties or the night sky. All

15 operations shall be fully contained so that little to no light escapes.

16 Light shall not escape at a level that is visible from neighboring

61. properties or the public right of way between sunset and sunrise.

Comments based on relevant experience stated that most "conventional"
17 greenhouses would not satisfy these requirements and that light pollution should be classified as a
18 significant effect. CDFW indicated Licensees in rural open and timberlands may be less inclined

19

20 to prevent light escapement since "neighboring properties or public right of way might be 0.25

miles away or more."

21 62. CDFW further indicated that potential impacts of light on wildlife were not
22 analyzed in the Negative Declaration. Cannabis cultivation increasingly uses artificial lighting in
23  greenhouses. The adverse effects of artificial night lighting on terrestrial, aquatic, and marine
24 resources such as fish, birds, mammals, and plants are well documented. Some of these effects

25

26

27 include altered migration patterns and reproductive and development rates, changes in singing

28 Including, but not limited to, salmon species, foothill yellow-legged frog, California red-legged from, grasslands,
riparian habitats, wetlands, oak woodlands and vernal pools.
-13-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

behavior in bird species, phototaxis (attraction and movement towards light), disorientation,
2 entrapment, and temporary blindness, etc.

63. These comments provide substantial evidence that commercial cannabis cultivation
4 may result in light pollution, which could have potentially significant environmental effects.

5 4. Air Pollutant Emissions

6 64. There is also substantial evidence supporting a fair argument that the Ordinance
7 may result a significant effect from increased air pollutant emissions.

8 65. Comments based on relevant experience indicated that "cannabis cultivation is
9 significantly more energy and carbon intensive than other crops" and the Ordinance's lighting
10 requirements may increase the carbon intensity of cannabis cultivation. Methane and carbon
11 dioxide emissions may also increase if "agricultural residues" resulting from the cannabis
12 cultivation operations are composted or incinerated. Vapors, particles, and gases from the cannabis
13 operations may be ozone precursors, and there are no delineated filtration methodologies.

14 5. Increased Energy Demand

15 66. Comments noted there is a documented increase in demand for electricity
16 associated with cannabis cultivation. Even if each Licensee uses a sustainable source of energy,
17 there still may be a cumulative impact from energy use that may result in significant
18 environmental effects. These effects include increases in the energy and carbon intensity of

19 cannabis cultivation relative to other crops.

20 67. In addition, although the Ordinance requires the use of renewable energy through
21 clean power purchasing agreements, this is an ineffective means to mitigate the potential increased
22 demand for electricity. As one comment noted:

23 Many analyses of clean power initiatives have concluded that this is

24 merely shuffling the deck chairs on the Titanic - unless the subject industry is putting up solar panels or wind turbines to directly offset

25 energy use, while clean power purchase agreements are of some value, they are not a panacea.
26 111
27 ///
28 ///

-14-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Using "clean power" for these permitted applications may create potentially significant effects,

2 such as less available clean power for others, thereby resulting in additional "dirty power" used

3 elsewhere.

4 6. Congregation of Persons at Growing Sites

5 68. Comments based on relevant experience further noted that the congregation of fifty

6 (50) or more persons at growing site is likely, given the reported high labor demands of cannabis
7 cultivation, which could result in significant effects. As one comment appropriately noted:

8 With unemployment in San Mateo County at 3.2%, and existing

9 farms already reporting labor shortages, it begs several rather obvious questions - where would these works come from, what roads would they drive on, and where would they live. The answers
10 to these questions are proper topics of discussion of an adequate environmental review.
11

12 Thus, an increased labor force could potentially result in an increase in commuting activities (such

13 as driving) and an increased demand for housing - both of which contribute greenhouse gas

14 emissions.

15 7. The County's Negative Declaration Violated CEQA and it Should Have Instead Drafted an EIR
16

17 69. The original determination of whether to prepare a Negative Declaration or an EIR
18 is subject to the "fair argument" test. (See Guidelines § 15384(a); see also Laurel Heights, supra,
19 47 Cal.3d at pp. 393-394.) If a lead agency is presented with a fair argument that a project may
20 have a significant effect on the environment, the agency must prepare an EIR even though there

21 may be other substantial evidence that the project will not have a significant effect. (Guidelines §§
22 15384(a), 15064(0)(1); Laurel Heights, supra, 47 Cal.3d at pp. 393-94.) Importantly, "It is the
23 possibility, of a significant effect which is at issue, not a determination of the actual effect,
24 which would be the subject of a negative declaration or an EIR." (Azusa Land Reclamation Co. v.
25 Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1165, 1200 [italics in original].)

26 70. There is a low threshold for triggering CEQA's EIR requirement. The California
27 Legislature intended CEQA "to be interpreted in such a manner as to afford the fullest possible
28 protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language. This principle

-15-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

of interpretation demands a low threshold requirement for preparation of an EIR." (Sundstrom v.
2 County of Mendocino (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 296, 301.)

3 71. Each of the public comments to the County's Negative Declaration, as set forth
4 herein, presented substantial evidence supporting a fair argument that the proposed Ordinance may
5 have significant effects on the environment. These effects included impacts to hydrology and
6 water quality, sensitive species and habitat, air pollutant emissions, light pollution, amongst
7 others. The County was therefore required to draft an EIR rather than proceeding to adopt a

8 Negative Declaration. (See No Oil, supra, 13 Cal.3d at p. 75 [holding that an EIR is required
9 "whenever it can be fairly argued on the basis of substantial evidence that [a] project may have
10 significant environmental impact"]; see also Guidelines § 15063(b)(1) ["If the agency determines
11 that there is substantial evidence that any aspect of the project, either individually or cumulatively,
a 12 may cause a significant effect on the environment, regardless of whether the overall effect of the
13 project is adverse or beneficial, the lead agency shall . . . prepare an EIR"] [italics added].)

14 72. It is of no import that the County may have presented other evidence or information
15 in its responses to public comments that the proposed Ordinance will not have a significant effect.
16 (Guidelines §§ 15384(a), 15064(f)(1); Friends of "B" Street V. City of Hayward (1980) 106
17 Cal.App.3d 988, 1002 ["If there was substantial evidence that the proposed project might have a
18 significant environmental impact, evidence to the contrary is not sufficient to support a decision to

19 dispense with preparation of an EIR ... because it could be 'fairly argued' that the project might
20 have a significant environmental impact" [citations]].)

21 73. The County abused its discretion and violated CEQA by approving the Negative
22 Declaration for the Ordinance when the record contained substantial evidence indicating that the
23 Ordinance may have significant environmental effects. (Guidelines § 15063(b)(1); City of
24 Arcadia, supra, 135 Cal.App.4th at p. 1421.) The County further abused its discretion and violated

25 CEQA by failing to draft an EIR given the substantial evidence in the record indicating potentially
26 significant adverse environmental effects. (Guidelines § 15063(b); Pub. Resources Code §
27 21082.2(d).) The relatively low threshold for triggering CEQA's EIR requirement was certainly
28 met. (Sundstrom, supra, 202 Cal.App.3d at p. 301.)

-16-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

B. The County Failed to Provide an Adequate Project Description and Identification of the Environmental Setting
2

3 74. Under CEQA, a Notice of Determination to adopt a Negative Declaration and a
4 Negative Declaration must include description of the project. (Guidelines §§ 15071(a),
15072(f)(1), 15075(b)(2); Cal. Pub. Resources Code § 21092.) "The negative declaration is
6 inappropriate where the agency has failed either to provide an accurate project description or to
7 gather information and undertake an adequate environmental analysis." (City of Redlands, supra,
8 96 Cal.App.4th at p. 406.)

9 75. The policy underlying the need for a complete and accurate project description is
10 clear - it is "necessary for an intelligent evaluation of the potential environmental impacts of the

11 agency's action." (City of Redlands, supra, 96 Cal.App.4th at p. 406; El Dorado County
12 Taxpayers for Quality Growth v. County of El Dorado (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1591, 1597.) As
13 the County of Inyo court held:
14 Only through an accurate view of the proiect may affected outsiders and public decision-makers balance the proposal's benefit against its
15 environmental cost, consider mitigation measures. assess the

16 advantage of terminating the proposal ... and weigh other alternatives in the balance.

17 (County of Inyo, supra, 71 Cal.App.3d at pp. 192-193.)

18 76. An Initial Study must include both a description of the project and an identification
19 of the environmental setting. (Guidelines, § 15063(d)(1)-(2); City of Redlands, supra, 96
20 Cal.App.4th at p. 406; Lighthouse, supra, 131 Cal.App.4th at p. 1194.)

21 1. Project Description

22 77. Here, the Negative Declaration failed to provide legally adequate project
23 description. First, these documents have failed to provide any description of existing operations
24 that could qualify for the cannabis cultivation permits, instead stating that permits for these
25 existing operations will be subject to future ministerial review and a future permitting process. The
26 Negative Declaration does not provide a description of the natural features of these existing
27 operations, their acreage, topographical characteristics, a map of existing operations, etc. Indeed,
28 the County fails to even provide a number, or at least an estimate, of how many existing

-17-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 operations there are within unincorporated areas of the County, Without any description

2 whatsoever of existing commercial cannabis greenhouse operations it is impossible to assess
3 whether the project will have adverse environmental effects. (See City of Redlands, supra, 96
4 Cal.App.4th at p. 408 [*[T]he initial threshold study is inadequate because it fails to provide
5 sufficient evidence or analysis of the potential environmental effects . . ."].)

6 78. The Negative Declaration also failed to provide any description whatsoever of
7 future commercial cannabis greenhouse operations. Even though the Ordinance contemplates
8 separate approvals and assessments for existing and future commercial cannabis operations, the

9 County is required to provide a sufficient project description for both types of operations. In City
10 of Redlands, supra, for example, the County of San Bernardino approved amendments modifying
11 its general plan relating to land use regulation of unincorporated territory. (City of Redlands,
12 supra, 96 Cal.App.4th at p. 403.) The County adopted a negative declaration under CEQA. (Ibid.)
13 Various municipalities filed petitions for writ of mandate alleging that the County failed to comply
14 with CEQA in adopting the amendments. (Ibid.) The trial and appellate court agreed. (Ibid.) The
15 court of appeal held, in part, that the record clearly indicated the existence of potential future
16 development, and the County failed to adequately consider future development in making its
17 determination to adopt the negative declaration. (Id. at p. 409.)

18 79. Here, City of Redlands is analogous because even though the Ordinance
19 contemplates "separate approvals and environmental assessments" for existing versus future

20 commercial cannabis operations, the project description and initial study fail to evaluate or
21 describe future operations. An evaluation of the Ordinance as a whole "must necessarily include a
22 consideration of the larger project," i.e. future commercial cannabis operations. (Christward
23 Ministry V. Superior Court (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 180, 194.) Even if the County claims it is
24 difficult or tedious to describe future permitted operations, an "agency should not be allowed to
25 hide behind its own failure to gather relevant data." (City of Redlands, supra, 96 Cal.App.4th at p.
26 416; see also Nelson v. County of Kern (2010) 190 Cal.App.4th 252, 270 [*Where an agency fails .

27 ., to gather information and undertake an adequate environmental analysis in its initial study, a
28 negative declaration is inappropriate"].)

-18-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

2. Environmental Setting

2 80. The County further failed to provide any description whatsoever of the
3 environmental setting for the Project. Indeed, the Initial Study omits any reference to "existing
4 physical conditions, including topography and types of habitats and vegetation." (Lighthouse,
5 supra, 131 Cal.App.4th at p. 1192.) The Initial Study further fails to describe "existing facilities,"
6 such as existing greenhouse facilities that could qualify for cannabis permits, or "existing site
7 conditions." (Ibid.)

8 81. Lighthouse, supra, concerned an initial study for off-leash dog use of a state beach.
9 (Lighthouse, supra, 131 Cal.App.4th at p. 1177.) The initial study at issue described the
10 environmental setting with some specificity, and noted the existence of "seasonal ponds,"
11 "unpaved trails," a "site for monarch butterflies," "mixed cypress/eucalyptus grove," amongst
12 other conditions. (Lighthouse, supra, 131 Cal.App.4th at p. 1192.) The court of appeal found that
13 the initial study met the minimum requirements of Guidelines section 15063(d)(2) for identifying

14 the baseline environmental setting. (Id. at 1194.)

15 82. Here, however, the Initial Study does not provide any description of water
16 resources, species, vegetation, agriculture, trails, etc. It is impossible to ascertain whether the

17 Project will have adverse environmental impacts without any description of the Project's existing
18 environmental setting. The County therefore provided the public with an insufficient factual basis

19 upon which to comment on the proposed Ordinance, and consequently deprived the public of their
20 right to "informed decision making and informed public participation." (Lighthouse, supra, 131
21 Cal.App.4th at p. 1182.)

22 3. The County's Failure to Provide and Adequate Project Description and Identification of the Environmental Setting was Prejudicial Error.
23

24 83. "CEQA advances policy of requiring an agency to evaluate the environmental
25 effects of a project at the earliest possible stage in the planning process." (City of Redlands, supra,
26 96 Cal.App.4th at p. 410.) Here, however, the County has failed to gather or supply any data
27 relevant to descriptions of existing or future commercial cannabis greenhouse operations. By
28 failing to describe these operations, including their environmental setting, and by deferring full

-19-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 environmental assessment of the consequences of these actions to future discretionary review, the

2 County has failed to comply with CEQA's policy and requirements. (Ibid.) This failure constituted

3 a prejudicial abuse of discretion. (Lighthouse, supra, 131 Cal.App.4th at p. 1183 ["Where an

4 agency fails to provide an accurate project description, or fails to gather information and undertake
5 an adequate environmental analysis in its initial study, a negative declaration is inappropriate. A
6 prejudicial abuse of discretion may be found regardless of whether a different outcome would
7 have resulted if a public ageney had complied with those provisions" [citations]].)

C. Failure of Initial Study to Analyze All Project Components and Effects

9 84. Pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15063(c), the purpose of an Initial Study is
10| to provide a preliminary analysis of a proposed action to determine whether to prepare a Negative
11 Declaration or an EIR. The Initial Study provides a factual basis for the Negative Declaration, or
12 serves to focus an EIR on the significant effects of a project. (See Guidelines §§ 15063, 15070; see
13 also Nelson, supra,190 Cal.App.4th at p. 270.)

14 85. Under Guidelines section 15063(a)(1), "All phases of project planning,
15 implementation, and operation must be considered in the Initial Study of the project." Courts have
16 consistently held that when an agency fails "to gather information and undertake an adequate
17 environmental analysis in its initial study, a negative declaration is inappropriate." (Nelson, supra,

18 190 Cal.App.4th at p. 270 [quoting El Dorado, supra,122 Cal.App.4th at p. 1597].) "The scope of
19 the environmental review conducted for the initial study must include the entire project."
20| (Tuolumne County Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. v. City of Sonora (2007) 155
21 Cal.App.4th 1214, 1222.)

22 86. Here, the County's Initial Study is legally insufficient because it failed to analyze
23 all potentially significant effects of the Ordinance. For instance, Ordinance section 5.148.160(f)
24 states that commercial cannabis cultivation cannot displace any non-cannabis commercial
25 agricultural production existing as of January 1, 2017. Alternatively, a person seeking to engage in
26 commercial cannabis cultivation may offset a proposed cultivation site by relocating existing
27 agricultural production to another area of the property on a 1:1 ratio. In a response to comments
28 regarding the 1:1 ratio, the County stated that "the ordinance does not require that the relocated

-20-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 agriculture be of the same type as that displaced, but the replacement agriculture must be non-
2 cannabis." However, the Initial Study never considered whether relocating one type of agriculture

3 with another type of agriculture would result in significant environmental effects. Still, despite
4 failing to consider the potentially significant effects of agriculture relocation, the Initial Study

5 proceeded to conclude that the relocation would not result in significant environmental impacts to
6 agricultural and forest resources.

87. Another comment raised concerns that "although cannabis cultivation would be
limited to existing greenhouse structures, these structures may require improvements, maintenance

9 activities, and would have to comply with fire code requirements that require emergency vehicle
10 access and turn-around, vegetation management, and fire breaks around all structures." Again, the
11 Initial Study never considered whether improvements and maintenance to existing greenhouse
12 structures, in addition to compliance with fire code requirements, vegetation management, etc.
13 would result in significant environmental effects.4 Instead, the County deferred analysis of
14 modifications and improvements to existing greenhouse structures to future discretionary review.
15 It is unclear, however, whether future discretionary review would be required. The Initial Study
16 proceeded to conclude that the Ordinance would not have significant impacts on biological
17 resources, despite failing to describe consider potentially significant effects of modifying,
18 improving, or maintaining existing greenhouse structures.

19 88. An additional comment raised concerns that the Negative Declaration and proposed
20 Ordinance "do not discuss or provide guidelines for the restoration and abandonment of cannabis

21 sites. Abandoned cannabis cultivation is known to be a significant and ongoing problem,
22 especially on public lands." The County responded that "to mitigate effects of future restoration
23 and abandonment of licensed [sic], the proposed ordinance requires all persons seeking a license
24 *to provide proof that Applicant has complied with all State insurance requirements and proof that
25 the Applicant has obtained a surety bond in the amount of not less than $35,000 ...'» However,
26 the Initial Study did not consider the potentially significant effects of restoring or abandoning

27

28 4 The comment raised concerns about potential impacts to sensitive habitat and species.
-21-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

cannabis sites. In addition, while the County's response admittedly seeks to "mitigate effects," the
2 Initial Study does not analyze the effectiveness of these mitigation measures or the potentially

3 significant effects that may result therefrom.

4 89. The Ordinance also contains several provisions whereby applicants for commercial

5 cultivation licenses must propose a "plan for compliance" at the Application stage. For example,

6 section 5.148.160(r) on "Water Usage" states that "a plan for compliance with this Section shall be
7 proposed at the Application stage." This same provision requiring a plan for compliance is also
8 incorporated into the Ordinance's sections on "Runoff and Storm Water," "Agricultural
9 Production Protection," "Fire Code Compliance," "Security and Fencing," and "Energy Usage." 99

10 90. However, neither the Initial Study nor the Negative Declaration assess or explain

11 whether these plans for compliance will have significant environmental effects, whether adverse
12 or beneficial. This is especially concerning since the County completely fails to describe what
13 these plans for compliance specifically require. The Ordinance neglects to set forth any

14 descriptions, analyses, protocols, data, or other information that must be included in the plans for
15 compliance. It is therefore impossible to ascertain whether these plans will have significant
16 effects. Instead, the County impermissibly defers analysis of whether the plans will have adverse
17 environmental effects to some nondescript future review.

18 91. The County violated CEQA by failing to consider the potentially significant effects
19 of these actions. CEQA requires the Initial Study to consider all phases of the Ordinance's
20| implementation and operation (i.e., the entire project), which, here, includes the relocation of
21 agriculture, improvements and maintenance to existing greenhouse structures, the restoration and
22 abandonment of cannabis sites, etc. (Guidelines §15063(a)(1); Lighthouse, supra, 131 Cal.App.4th
23 at p. 1200 [negative declaration set aside due to failure to consider whole project]; Tuolumne
24 County Citizens, supra, 155 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1231-1232 [negative declaration and entitlements

25 set aside where Initial Study failed to consider entire project].)

26 92. The County's adoption of the Negative Declaration and approval of the Ordinance
27 must therefore be set aside because of the County's prejudicial failure to review the potential
28 environmental impacts of the entire project. (Nelson, supra, 190 Cal.App.4th at pp. 272-272.) The

-22-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 County committed prejudicial error in failing to review these potentially significant impacts

2 because the public was deprived of the essential information and environmental analysis that
3 CEQA mandates. (Citizens Assn. for Sensible Development of Bishop Area v. County of Inyo

4 (1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 151, 166-67.)

5 D. Circumventing CEQA Review of Mitigation Measures

6 93. Only projects that will have no significant effect on the environment are exempt
7 from CEQA review. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21080(b)(9), 21084(a); Salmon Protection &
Watershed Network v. County of Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1102.) While an agency
may reduce a project's effects to a less-than-significant level through mitigation measures, it must
10 do So through a Mitigated Negative Declaration or an EIR, rather than a Negative Declaration.
11 (Guidelines § 15070; see also Salmon Protection, supra, 125 Cal.App.4th at p. 1099.)

12 94. Proposed mitigation measures "must be considered under the standards that apply
13 to a mitigated negative declaration." (Azusa Land Reclamation Co. v. Main San Gabriel Basin
14 Watermaster (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1165.) "If a project may have a significant effect on the
15 environment, CEQA review must occur and only then are mitigation measures relevant." (Salmon
16 Protection, supra, 125 Cal.App.4th at p. 1102; Azusa, supra, 52 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1199-1200;
17 Lotus V. Dept. of Transportation (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 645, 658 ["shortcutting of CEQA
18 requirements subverts the purposes of CEQA by omitting material necessary to informed
19 decisionmaking and informed public participation. It precludes both identification of potential
20 environmental consequences arising from the project and also thoughtful analysis of the
21 sufficiency of measures to mitigate those consequences"].) Thus, an agency must decide whether a

22 project may have significant effects without reference to or reliance upon any proposed mitigation
23 measures. (Salmon Protection, supra, 125 Cal.App.4th at p. 1108; Azusa, supra, 52 Cal.App.4th at
24 pp. 1200-1201].)

25 95. Consequently, any mitigation measures must be incorporated into a proposed
26 Mitigated Negative Declaration and the project revised accordingly before the Mitigated Negative
27 Declaration is released for public review. (Sundstrom, supra, 202 Cal.App.3d at p. 306.) This is

28

-23-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 essential in order for the public to review the proposed mitigation measures and determine whether

2 they are sufficient to eliminate the significant effects.

3 96. Here, the County impermissibly circumvented the CEQA environmental review

4 process by incorporating mitigation measures into the Ordinance after the Negative Declaration
5 was released for public review, and without adherence to CEQA's substantive and procedural
6 requirements for mitigation measures.

7 97. For instance, CDFW commented that in some rural areas "the neighboring

8 properties or public right of way might be 0.25 miles away or more and Licensees might be less

0 inclined to prevent light escapement from their nighttime, greenhouse grow operations." The

10 CDFW recommend a 250-ft visibility buffer to block light escapement at night. The County
11 subsequently adopted this proposed mitigation measure by modifying Ordinance section
12 5.148.160(h), which now states, in relevant part: "Between sunset and sunrise, light shall not

13 escape at a level that is visible from neighboring properties or the public right of way, and, to the
14 extent feasible, from a fixed location 250 feet in all directions from the structure where the
15 Cultivation is being conducted."

16 98. Comment A-3 indicated that odor resulting from commercial cannabis operations

17 in existing greenhouses constitutes significant environmental effect that would require mitigation
18 under the Ordinance. Comment C-2 raised concerns regarding potential ozone precursors resulting
19 from commercial cannabis operations, and noted the County's failure to delineate the "precise
20 nature of filtration methodologies." In response to both comments, the County modified
21 Ordinance section 5.148.130(f), which now states:

22 All premises shall be equipped with odor control filtration and

23 ventilation system(s) based on current industry-specific best control technologies and best management practices. No operable windows or exhaust vents shall be located on any building façade that abuts a
24 residential use or zone. Exhaust vents on rooftops shall direct

25 exhaust away from residential uses or zones.

26 99. The County violated CEQA by incorporating these mitigation measures into the
27 Ordinance after the Ordinance had already been released for public review. (Sundstrom, supra,
28 202 Cal. App. 3d at p. 306 ["If an applicant proposes measures that will mitigate environmental
-24-

effects, the project plans must be revised to incorporate these mitigation measures *before the
2 proposed negative declaration is released for public review . . .' [citation]." To permit an applicant

3 to do otherwise would be "contrary to law"].) In so doing, the County abused its discretion and
4 committed prejudicial error by unlawfully denying the public their right to review mitigation
5 measures and to determine whether they are sufficient to eliminate significant environmental
6 effects. (Guidelines § 15073; Cal. Pub. Resources Code § 21091.)

7 100. The County further violated CEQA by circumventing the environmental review

8 process. Rather than unlawfully adopting mitigation measures after the Ordinance was already

0 published for public review, CEQA instead mandates that the County draft an EIR. (Cal. Pub.
10 Resources Code §§ 21080(d), 21002.1.) The mitigation measures would then be incorporated into
11 the draft EIR and published for agency and public review. (Ibid.) By circumventing the EIR
12 requirement, the County deprived the public of its right to evaluate the actual environmental
13 impacts of the Ordinance because the adopted mitigation measures were never published for
14 public review. Indeed, the potential effectiveness of these mitigation measures remains unknown.

15 101. Further, as demonstrated, below, these future plans and studies lack the requisite
16 performance standards and criteria to legally defer mitigation of these impacts to a future time.

17 E. The Granting of Future "Ministerial" Licenses to Licensees Operating Cannabis Cultivation Activities in Existing Greenhouses
18

19 102. The CEQA review process only applies to "discretionary projects." (Cal. Pub.
20 Resources Code § 21090(a).) While the Act itself does not define "discretionary project," courts

21 have defined the term as a project which requires a "the exercise of judgment or deliberation when
22 the public agency or body decides to approve or disapprove a particular activity." (Guidelines §
23 15357; Johnson v. State of California (1968) 69 Cal.2d 782, 788; Nat. Resources Defense Council

24 v. Arcata Nat. Corp. (1976) 59 Cal.App.3d 959, 969.)

25 103. On the other hand, ministerial projects are exempt from CEQA. (Guidelines §
26 15268(a).) The term "ministerial" "describes a governmental decision involving little or no
27 personal judgment by the public official as to the wisdom or manner of carrying out the project.

28

-25-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

P The public official merely applies the law to the facts as presented but uses no special discretion or
2 judgment in reaching a decision." (Guidelines § 15369; Johnson, supra, 69. Cal.2d at p. 788.)

3 104. The County states that "the only cannabis cultivation activities that could occur . ..

4 with solely a ministerial license, are those that occur within an existing greenhouse not requiring
5 substantial expansion." However, the granting of a license to Licensees operating existing
greenhouses under the Ordinance is not entirely "ministerial" in nature. For instance, section
5.148.160(r) of the Ordinance on "Water Usage" states that "Licensees must identify a water
8 supply source adequate to meet all Cultivation uses on a sustainable basis for the Premises . .

9 The Ordinance does not, however, define the term "sustainable" - a term which is inherently open
10 to a range of interpretations. It remains unclear what standards, metrics, qualifications, etc. must

11 be met for a water source to meet cultivation uses a on a "sustainable basis." The County thus
12 retains considerable discretion in ascertaining whether a "sustainable basis" has been met, and
13 therefore retains discretion in determining whether to issue a license. The granting of a license to
14 Licensees operating existing greenhouses under the Ordinance is therefore not wholly ministerial
15 in nature, and the Ordinance therefore violates CEQA by purporting to eliminate any future CEQA

16 review.

17 105. This same issue applies to a different part of section 5.148.160(r), which, as
18 discussed, states that "a plan for compliance with this Section shall be proposed at the Application

19 stage." Again, this section of the Ordinance is not truly ministerial in nature because the "plan for
20 compliance" is not defined and is subject to future discretionary review. It remains unclear what

21 this "plan for compliance" requires, what standards must be met, and whether the plan, if
22 approved, would have significant effects on the environment, including impacts to biological
23 resources and sensitive species and habitat. Ministerial projects involve "governmental
24 decision[s] which a public officer or public agency makes upon a given state of facts in a
25 prescribed manner in obedience to the mandate of legal authority." (Day v. City of Glendale
26 (1975) 51 Cal.App.3d 817, 822.) Here, however, there is no "prescribed manner" or "legal

27

28 For instance, one comment stated, "We suggest that the sections for Pest Prevention, Runoff and Storm Water, and Wastewater Discharge should also address potential impacts to biological resources and sensitive species and habitat."
-26-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

authority" as to how the County will approve the "plan for compliance." This section effectively
2 defers analysis of the "plan for compliance" to future discretionary review - it is not "ministerial."

3 106. This same issue applies to the Ordinance's sections on "Runoff and Storm Water,"

4 "Agricultural Production Protection," "Fire Code Compliance," "Security and Fencing," and
5  "Energy Usage," all of which require a *plan for compliance" but fail to set forth any "prescribed

6 manner" as to how the County will decide whether to grant the license, or what standards, metrics,
requirements, etc. the applicant must meet.

107. Another issue is that the Ordinance appears to be both ministerial and discretionary

9 1n nature. For instance, as set forth infra, the County can grant ministerial licenses to Licensees
10 operating cannabis cultivation activities in existing greenhouses, yet the County still retains a level

11 of discretion in granting these licenses. For example, the County has discretion to determine
12 whether a water source will meet cultivation uses on a "sustainable basis." However, Courts have

13 routinely held that where project approval involves elements of both ministerial action and
14 discretionary action, the project will be deemed to be discretionary and therefore subject to CEQA.
15 (See Guidelines 15268(d); People v. Dept. of Housing and Community Dev. (1975) 45
16 Cal.App.3d 185, 194 ['[D]oubt whether a project is ministerial or discretionary should be resolved

17 in favor of the latter characterization"]; Friends of Westwood v. City of L.A. (1987) 191
18 Cal.App.3d 259, 271 [holding that where project has hybrid discretionary-ministerial character,
19 CEQA applies even if the process is largely ministerial].) Because the issuance of a license under
20 the Ordinance clearly involves both discretionary and ministerial characteristics, the license should

21 be deemed discretionary in nature and subject to CEQA review.

22 108. Finally, CEQA requires review of projects that may have significant environmental
23 effects, but there is no way to evaluate whether existing cannabis cultivation operations may have
24 significant effects when the County exempts the granting of licenses under the guise of ministerial
25 review. Indeed, as one comment appropriately stated:

26 [O]n the specific point of sufficiency of water supply, it has been

27 previously noted that cannabis cultivation requires more water than most other crops. For this reason, and because of the uniqueness of

28 individual sites, this is very concrete example of why discretionary permit review, and appropriate and adequate environmental review,

-27-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

compliant with California code, must be applied to every individual permit application, rather than relegating these important issues to
2 ministerial approval …. In the context of all of this, making a blanket statement that all future potential commercial cannabis
3 cultivation operations would have a less than significant impact is not reasonable, believable, or possible.
4

5 Another comment similarly stated:

6 Individual permit applications must not be removed from the discretionary permitting process, and must not be allowed to be
7 approved on an [sic] ministerial basis. By deferring this issue to future
analysis, the County avoids and sidesteps any actual documentation,
8 statistics, or analysis which would support its finding of less than significant impact.
9
10 These comments illustrate the problem of the County applying "quasi-ministerial review" to

11 license applications. The County cannot support its conclusion that the Ordinance will not have
12 significant environmental effects when it exempts the granting of licenses from CEQA review.

13 109. The County therefore abused its discretion and violated CEQA in approving the

14 Notice of Determination and adopting the Ordinance because the granting of a ministerial license

15 to Licensees operating existing greenhouses under the Ordinance involves discretionary
16 characteristics. The County thereby committed prejudicial error because it denied the public of
17 their right to determine whether actions undertaken by Licensees will have significant effects on
18 the environment.

19 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for relief as follows:

20 1. That this Court issue a peremptory writ of mandate:

21 a. Commanding Respondents to set aside their certification of the

22 Negative Declaration and to prepare an EIR and otherwise comply with CEQA in any subsequent
23 action taken to approve the Ordinance:

24 b. Commanding Respondents to immediately suspend all activities in
25 furtherance of the Ordinance, including all approvals and/or licenses issued pursuant thereto;

26 C. Commanding Respondents to set aside their approvals of the

27 Ordinance.

28

2 other injunctive relief, restraining Respondents from taking any further actions to carry out the

reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, or as otherwise
