- BACKGROUND FACTS

N A. THE PROJECT

au p w 10. The Project before the Board consists of the approval of three encroachment
permits - Permits Nos. 19027, 19047 and 19047-1.

11. The Project is in Yolo County and Solano County along Putah Creek in the City
of Winters, starting approximately 1,000 feet upstream of Railroad Avenue Bridge and
A continuing 7,900 feet downstream. The Project under Permit 19047-1 is located north of Putah

8 Creek Road and north of Race Course Land in the town of Winters, at 38.52261N

9 121.96313W, Putah Creek Solano County, California.

10 12. The permits allows SCWA to realign 1,100 linear feet of low-flow channel,

11 recontour the floodplain, remove some native vegetation and invasive vegetation species, and

12 replant with native grasses, shrubs, and tree species. Spawning gravel will be placed at riffle

13 locations.

14 13. The Project includes the removal of existing native and non-native vegetation

15 prior to grading activities and after grading is complete planting native vegetation along the

16 floodplain.

17 14. The Project also includes the issuance of an encroachment permit (Permit #

18 19047) for work that SCWA completed in 2011 without the required encroachment permit

19 from Board. That work realigned and narrowed 3,800 linear feet of existing low-flow channel,

20 20.5 acres of floodplain that was re-graded, removal of invasive weeds, planted vegetation, and

21 placement of spawning gravel.

22 15. The Project purportedly includes a series of phased restoration activities intended

23 to restore Putah Creek to a more natural condition that is self-maintaining and supports native

24 plant and animal species.

25 15. The Winters Putah Creek Nature Park Project approved by the City of Winters

26 covers the most upstream Project area and includes Phase and 2 (Permit No. 19047), and

27 Phase 3 for the channel segment between Phase and 2 (Permit No. 19047-1). The North

28 American Wetlands Conservation Act 3 ("NAWCA 3") Project approved by SCWA covers the

VBRIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 4

- most downstream Project area (Permit No. 19027).
N m tno B. HISTORY OF THE PROJECT

16. Putah Creek is a Regulated Stream as defined in Table 8.1 of Title 23, Division 1,
Article 8 of the California Code of Regulations. (See also Title 23 Cal. Code Regs., § 6.)

17. On September 9, 2013, Board staff authorized the Lower Putah Creek 2 North
American Wetlands Conservation Act Project (NAWCA 2), which is located approximately
7 one and a half mile upstream of the current Project. That authorization included the clearing of

8 trees and the planting of native plants, removal of accumulated sediment, and seeding of native

9 grass all within the Putah Creek floodway. NAWCA 2 is located approximately 12 miles

10 upstream of the closest flood control Project Levee.

11 18. On July 18,2015, Board staff directed SCWA to submit a permit application as

12 agreed to in the SCWA authorization request letter. SCWA submitted an application on July

13 24,2015 to authorize the work that was completed under the 2013 authorization and the Board

14 issued Permit No. 19052 on January 5, 2017.

15 19. On March 26, 2015, SCWA submitted Application No. 19027 to the Board for the

16 NAWCA 3. NAWCA 3 Project is located adjacent to Putah Creek Road between Johnson

17 Road an Boyce Road, in the town of Winters. NAWCA 3 provides for SCWA to re-grade the

18 floodplain to a uniform 1-2% slope, fill and narrow segments of the existing low-flow channel,

19 and create a low-flow side channel. Prior to grading activities, SCWA will remove existing

20 native and non-native vegetation. After grading is complete, SCWA intends to plant native

21 vegetation along the floodplain. Board staff completed their review and sent to the application

22 to United States Army Corps of Engineer's Flood Protection and Navigation Section (Section

23 408) on April 30, 2015 for its review.

24 20. On June 4, 2015, SCWA submitted to the Board Application No. 19047-1 for

25 Phase 3 of the Winters Putah Creek Nature Park Project ("WPCNP"). SCWA mobilized for

26 construction of Phase 3 without obtaining an encroachment permit form the Board. Board staff

27 received a call from an adjacent landowner, Mr. Jeff TenPas, about SCWA's unauthorized

28 activities. The Board staff discovered that SCWA's had completed Phase 1 and 2 of the 1 2

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 5

-

2 Project without obtaining a permit or authorization from the Board. Board staff directed

D au p u SCWA cease activity associated with Phase 3 and 3 to submit Application No.19047 to authorize
the previously completed work for Phases 1 and 2.

21. On August 11,2015, SCWA requested that Board staff grant SCWA
authorization to commence WPCNP Phase 3 work without a permit. The proposed work
included clearing and grubbing, grading, and native grass revegetation while the Board

8 processed Application No. 19047-1. On the same day as the request, Board staff granted

9 SCWA authorization to commence work without obtaining the required permit. In response to

10 a complaint from Mr. Tenpas and Winters Friends of Putah Creek, the Board rescinded the

authorization.

11 C. ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW

12 22.

13 The City of Winters prepared an Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration

14 ("IS/MND") (SCH No. 2008042018, April 2008), and a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting

15 Plan ("MMRP") for the Winters Putah Creek Nature Park/Floodplain Restoration and

16 Recreational Access Project. On December 4, 2008, the City of Winters approved the IS/MND

17 and MMRP and filed a Notice of Determination. In approving the IS/MND, the City of Winters

18 found that with incorporation of the identified mitigation measures, the Project's significant and

19 potentially significant environmental impacts would be reduced to less than significant levels

20 for all affected environmental resource areas.

23.

21 SCWA prepared an IS/MND (SCH No. 2015032094, March 2015) and MMRP

22 for NAWCA 3. The SCWA adopted the IS/MND and MMRP and on June 22, 2015 filed a

23 Notice of Determination. SCWA found that with incorporation of the identified mitigation

24 measures, the NAWCA 3 Project's significant and potentially significant environmental

25 impacts would be reduced to less than significant levels for all affected environmental resource

areas.

26 24.

27 The United State Army Corps of Engineers (*USACE") prepared an

28 Environmental Assessment for the Putah Creek Channel Restoration Project (December 2015,
revised August 2017).

25. On May 18,2018, the Board conducted a public hearing on the applications for
Permit Nos. 19047, 19047-1 and 19027.

26. On May 22, 2018 the Board filed Notices of Determination with the Office of
Planning and Research.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

27. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to

9 Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, and Public Resources Code section 21168. In the

10 alternative, this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 and
Public Resources Code section 21168.5.

11 28.

12 Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 394(a), venue is proper in this Court

13 because a portion of the Project is located in the County of Solano.

14 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES
AND INADEQUACY OF REMEDY

15 29. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant action

16 and has exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

17 30. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code, section

18 21167.5 by sending via facsimile and Federal Express written notice of this action to the

19 Respondents. A copy of this written notice and proof of service are attached as Exhibit A to this

20 Petition for Writ of Mandate.

21 31. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.6 by

22 concurrently filing: request concerning preparation of the record of administrative proceedings

23 relating to this action.

24 32. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

25 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require the Board to set aside its

26 approval of the Permits. In the absence of such remedies, the Board's approval will remain in

27 effect in violation of State law.

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

F 33. This action has been brought within 30 days of the Board's filing of the Notice of

2 Determinations as required by Public Resources Code section 21167(c).
02 7 10 0 STANDING

34. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because Petitioner
and its members' aesthetic and environmental interests are directly and adversely affected by

7 the Board's approval of the permits for the SCWA's Putah Creek Floodplain Restoration

8 Project.

CAUSE OF ACTION 9

10 (Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.) 11
35. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 34, 12

13 inclusive, of this Petition, as if fully set forth below.

36. Respondent committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in a 14

15 manner required by law by relying on an IS/MND that does not address Phase 3 and by failing

16 to prepare a subsequent or supplemental environmental document as required by CEQA. In

17 approving Permit 19047-1 for Phase 3 of the Winters Putah Creek Nature/Park/Floodplain

18 Restoration and Recreation Access Project, the Board failed to prepare a supplemental or

19 subsequent environmental document as the City of Winters' IS/MND did not address in

20 particular the extensive vegetation clearing, earthmoving, and importation of fill in Phase 3.

37. The inclusion of Phase 3 as part of the "the Project" constitutes a substantial 21

22 change to the Project. CEQA requires that a responsible agency prepare a subsequent

23 environmental review document when there are changes to a project or its circumstances occurs

24 after adoption of a negative declaration and the responsible agency grants the next discretionary

25 approval for the project. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21166; CEQA Guidelines, § 15162(c).)

26 Changes in a project require preparation of a subsequent or supplemental EIR when the

27 following conditions are found to exist:

28 (1) the change in the project is substantial;

8 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

NOUPW N- (2) the change involves new or more severe significant environmental
impacts;
(3) the change will required major revisions to the previous environmental document based on the new or more severe impacts;
and
(4) the new or more severe impacts were not considered in the previous
environmental document. (Id.)

38. The IS/MND makes no reference to Phase 3 of the Project. The Project
Description states:

co The proposal is divided into two phases, based on the sequencing needed to accomplish the project efficiently. Phase I includes the establishment of a
O- monitoring program; percolation dam removal; stream recontouring; and, in- channel structural improvements including weir construction, bank stabilization,
10 and habitat enhancement. Phase II includes the development of recreational amenities. (IS/MND at p. I; see also IS/MND at pp. 6, 12, and Notice of
11 Determination.)

12 39. In responding to comments on the IS/MND, the City of Winters stated:
13 The Master Plan and its associated activities are guidance and planning

14 documents, but should not be confused with specific or operational plans.

15 The various proposed restoration activities involve minor material moving within the floodplain and intermittent heavy equipment use.
16
***
17

18 Future project may require tiering from the WPCNP IS/MND or separate documents depending on the nature and extent of possible impacts.
19 40. Thus, the only existing CEQA environmental document and review, done by the
20 City of Winters in 2008, was an Initial Study and Mitigated Negative Declaration for a
21 conceptual Master Plan. The Master Plan was conceptual, lacking in detail, was not project
22 specific, and did not include disclosure or analysis of the major importation fill or any
23 significant vegetation clearing this project involved.
24
i. The proposed use of unsuitable fill, material that will limit riparian forest 25 growth and health to perpetuity.
26 ii. The proposed excessive compaction of fill.

27 ili. Impacts on humans and their aesthetic enjoyment of scenic views of riparian forest, stream, and especially aquatic wildlife.
28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 9

üAON - iv. Plans for floodplain topography that will reduce wetland and channel
habitat without mitigation.

41. The cumulative effect of Phases 1 and 2 (previously constructed without permit)
and Phase 3 will result in the cumulative importation of approximately 70,000 cubic yards of
fill according to the project proponent's estimates. The Board failed to consider the
cumulative effect of the currently proposed project and past projects. This amount of fill
would yield a net increase in floodplain elevation of approximately 1 foot extending for
approximately 4000 feet of floodplain and channel, while also significantly reducing channel

9 cross-section.

10 42. Phase 3 consists of grading the existing floodplain to a uniform 1-2 percent slope

11 to improve water conveyance. Phase 3 construction includes the importation of 10,000 yd3 of

12 clean fill. The IS/MND's Project Description, however, makes no reference to the Phase 3

13 construction or the quantity of fill that will be placed in the floodplain. It certainly makes no

14 reference using an excavator for clearing and grubbing within floodplain. Nor does it describe

15 the amount of fill that would be brought into the floodplain. Phase 3 also now includes a

16 paved trail adjacent to the stream to provide access to views of the stream and wildlife. The

17 2008 IS/MND simply did not address these parts of the project. The IS/MND also makes

18 reference to the Board's approval of an encroachment permit. no

43.
19 The implementation of Phase 3 will result in impacts to groundwater recharge and

20 vegetation due to the compaction of the imported fill and the alteration to floodplain structure

21 and groundwater flow paths. The result is that Phase 3 will impact the most diverse, most

22 occupied and most valuable instream wildlife habitat in Winters. Additionally, Phase 3 will

23 not support a healthy riparian forest and will not provide replacement for the loss of open

24 waters and wetlands; and there will be loss of enjoyment of view of the creek and wildlife to

25 the people of Winters.

26 44. Specific actions of clearing, filing and effects on groundwater are not covered in

27 Phase 3, and these actions are not analyzed or addressed in any environmental document. As

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 10

such, approval of Permit 19047-1 for Phase 3 would constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion,
N m t no A as there is no environmental document that addresses the activities of Phase 3.

45. The change to the Project is substantial as it was not previously discussed or
disclosed in the IS/MND. The change involves new severe environmental impacts regarding
impacts to the flood plain and vegetation and groundwater processes. Additionally, the changes
to the Project and potential significant impacts require revisions to the IS/MND and mitigation

measures. The impacts associated with the expanded project were not discussed or addressed in
8 the IS/MND.

a 46. As the City of Winters' IS/MND never analyzed or discussed Phase 3, the Board

10 must also address the cumulative impacts to groundwater recharge and riparian vegetation of

11 Phases 1, 2 and 3, as well as the cumulative impacts to groundwater recharge and riparian
12 vegetation from the implementation of NACWA 3 (Permit 19027.)

13 47. Based upon the foregoing, the Board's failure to conduct subsequent

14 environmental review regarding Phase 3 (Permit 19047-1) and/or NACWA 3 (Permit 19027)

15 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion and fails to comply with CEQA's requirements.
