1 PROJECT BACKGROUND, ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND APPROVAL

11. The Notice of Preparation ("NOP") for the Project was issued on or about May
3 22, 2014. The City received numerous written comments during the NOP comment period. 2

12. The Draft EIR was released on January 7, 2016. The City received numerous 4

5 written comments on the Draft EIR during this review period.

6 13. Respondent did not recirculate a revised Draft EIR. Instead, Respondent prepared

8 14. Notwithstanding the fact that the City had conducted an EIR for the Project, the 7 responses to comments and published a Final EIR.

9 Respondent nonetheless determined that the Project qualified for both a statutory exemption and
10 several categorical exemptions on or about March 8, 2018.

11 15. On June 23, 2016 a Hearing Officer, as a representative of the City Planning
LLZ06 00E eunS pAia elys!!M 00Z8 d'11 'dnoJg ME7 jeuueyd 12 Commission, held a public hearing regarding a draft of the proposed Project.
13 16. On March 8, 2018 the City Planning Commission held a hearing regarding the a E
'SIlH Áueeg 14 Project. The City Planning Commission purported to certify the Final EIR, adopt the
15 environmental findings contained in the Environmental Resolution, adopt a Statement of
16 Overriding Considerations, adopts the Mitigation and Monitoring Program and approve the
17 Project.

18 17. However, the City Planning Commission in taking such action was acting

19 I pursuant to a resolution adopted by City Council which mandated "that the Departments of
20 Transportation, Planning, and Public Works work cooperatively on the preparation of land use

creation of lighting and parking districts, and other necessary plans, as part of these Livable 21  plans, zoning maps and ordinances, pedestrian improvement plans, streetscape plans, and the
22

23 Boulevard comprehensive corridor plans."
24 On or about May 21, 2018, the City filed both a Notice of Determination
25 ("NOD") and Notice of Exemption ("NOE") with the County Recorder. At the time such NOD 18.

6 21. The City Planning Commission, acting alone, had no authority to adopt the

12 24. The City Planning Commission, acting alone, had no authority to approve the

14 25. The City Council never adopted the specific procedures required under the CEQA
15 Guidelines for "[a]ssigning responsibility for determining the adequacy of an EIR," and
16 "[r]eviewing and considering environmental documents by the person or decision making body 17 who will approve or disapprove a project" (Guidelines, § 15022, subd. (a)(8), (9) to delegate
18 such authority to the City Planning Commission.
19 26. Thereafter, on May 21, 2018, the City of Los Angeles Board of Public Works
20 held a hearing and adopted the Livable Boulevards Streetscape Plan. Thereafter, on May 22,
21 2018 the City filed another NOD and NOE with the County Recorder. All of these environmental
22 notices were prematurely filed because only the City Council could have approved the Project
23 because the Project was comprised of numerous legislative components.
24 27. On or about June 13, 2018 the City Council's Transportation Committee
25 ("Committee") held a public hearing to consider the Project, the EIR and CEQA exemption
26 determination. The Committee recommended approved to the City Council. On or about June

CEOA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS 4

5 28. In 1970, the California Legislature enacted CEQA, as a means of forcing public

6 agency decision makers, such as Respondent, to document and consider the environmental
7 implications of its actions. CEQA's fundamental goal is to fully inform the public and the

8 decision makers as to the environmental consequences of proposed projects and to assure
members of the public that their elected officials are making informed decisions. CEQA requires
10 governmental authorities, such as Respondent, to fully evaluate. potential environmental effects
of projects, and to seek feasible means to reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that
LIZ06 euns d77 "dnoig 12  otherwise could result from their actions, CEQA limits agencies from approving projects with 11
§

* NS HM USIMA D0Z8 on e lorg AueAeg 13 significant adverse impacts when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen such impacts.
14 29. The primary function of an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") is to discuss the
15 important environmental consequences of the project, including cumulative effects, and to
16 provide the agency and the general public with mitigation measures and alternatives to the
17 project that would have less serious environmental consequences. Under CEQA, lead agencies,
18 such as Respondent, are required to prepare a complete and legally adequate EIR prior to
19 approving any discretionary project that may have a significant adverse effect on the

21 significant environmental effects. CEQA also requires lead agencies, such as Respondent, to 20 environment. The EIR must fully disclose and adequately analyze the project's potentially

22 consider mitigation measures and alternatives to a project, adopt all feasible mitigation measures
23 and/or alternatives, determine whether proposed mitigation measures will be effective in
24 avoiding or substantially lessening the project's significant environmental impacts, and to make
25 adequate findings, including an adequate statement of overriding consideration for those
26 significant environmental impacts deemed unavoidable.

N FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

3 (VIOLATION OF CEQA: Unlawful Delegation of Certification Authority)

30. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporated by references the preceding paragraphs in
5 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

31. A public agency's decision-making body may not delegate its responsibility (1) to
review and consider the information in a final EIR or negative declaration before approving a
8 project or (2) to make findings required by 14 Cal Code Regs §§15091 and 15093. 14 Cal Code
Regs §15025(b)(1)-(2); California Clean Energy Comm. v City of San Jose (2013) 220 CA4th
10 1325, 1335; Vedanta Soc'y v California Quartet, Ltd. (2000) 84 CA4th 517. See §17.16. CEQA's

16 32. The City never adopted the specific procedures required under CEQA to delegate
17 authority to the City Planning Commission to certify the FEIR.
18 33. Even if the City had adopted such procedures, they were defective in that the City
19 could not lawfully separate certification of the FEIR from the approval of the Project, the
20 adoption of the required findings, the effective ability to consider and adopt mitigation measures
21 and the authority to adopt a statement of overriding considerations.
22 34. Neither the City Planning Commission nor the Board of Public Works had the
23 authority to approve the project. CEQA Guidelines §15356 defines the "decision-making body"
24 as the "person or group of people" with the legal authority to approve or disapprove the project.
25 Clearly, the City Planning Commission was not the "decision-maker" with regard to the Project
26 because it was not vested with the legal authority to approve or disapprove the project (nor could

1 they have been as the project involved legislative components). The City's attempt to delegate

2 its responsibility to the City Planning Commission violates 14 Cal Code Regs §15025(b)(1)-(2).
3 Because the City Planning Commission did not have the legal authority to certify the EIR, the
4 subsequent filing of the NOD was necessarily without legal effect. The FEIR was not properly
5 certified until the FEIR's certification by the City became effective on June 20, 2018.

10 (VIOLATION OF CEQA: EIR Does Not Comply with CEQA)
11 38. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in 8 d77 'dnoig MET ¡3uueYO LIZ06 12 eyns "pAla eulys!!M 00Z8 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
13 39. CEQA requires a lead agency for a project to prepare an EIR that complies with 8
SII!H Auereg 14 the requirements of the statute. The lead agency must also provide for public review and
15 comment on the project and associated environmental documentation. An EIR must provide
16 sufficient environmental analysis such that decision-makers can intelligently consider
17 environmental consequences when acting on proposed projects.
18 40. Respondents violated CEQA by certifying an EIR for the Project that is
19 inadequate and fails to comply with CEQA. Among other things, Respondent:
20 a. Failed to adequately analyze identified alternatives to the project and to mitigate impacts
21 by selecting a less impactful, feasible alternative to the Project without adopting a valid
22 statement of overriding considerations;
23 b. Failed to adequately analyze the environmental impacts of the Project by screening out
24 environmental factors related to the following: Hazards & Hazardous Materials, Mineral
25 Resources, Public Services, Utilities/Service Systems; Aquiculture Resources; Cultural
26 Resources; Hydrology/Water Quality; Recreation; Geology/Soils; Population/Housing.

41. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion

THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION 5

(VIOLATION OF CEQA: Inadequate Findings)
42. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
8 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
9 43. The City Planning Commission was not the decision-making body of the City and
10 thus the required findings were not properly adopted pursuant to CEQA's requirements until the

13 authority to the City Planning Commission to adopt the findings required by CEQA.
SIl!H Auereg 14 45. Even if the City had adopted such procedures, they were defective in that the City
15 could not lawfully separate adoption of the required findings from certification of the FEIR,
16 approval of the Project, the effective ability to consider and adopt mitigation measures and the
17 authority to adopt a statement of overriding considerations.
18 46. CEQA requires that a lead agency's findings for the approval of a project be
19 supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. CEQA further requires that a lead
20 agency provide an explanation of how evidence in the record supports the conclusions it has
21 reached.

22 47. Respondents violated CEQA by adopting findings that are inadequate as a matter
23 of law in that they are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, including, but not
24 limited to, the following.
25 a. The adoption of the Statement of Overriding Considerations;
26 b. The determination that the Project would cause no potentially significant impacts on the

d. The determination that certain impacts would be less than significant and/or that adopted
mitigation measures would avoid or lessen the Project's significant effects on the
7 environment;

e. The determination that alternatives to the Project and proposed mitigation measures that
would have avoided or lessened the significant impacts of the Project were infeasible;
10 f. The determination that alternatives considered would not meet project objectives.

FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION 15

16 (VIOLATION OF CEQA: Inadequate Response to Comments)
17 49. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
18 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
19 Respondents failed to respond adequately to comments submitted by Petitioner,
20 other members of the public, and other agencies. Instead, the responses given to numerous 50.

21 comments regarding the Project's impacts were dismissive, conclusory, evasive, confusing, or
22 otherwise non-responsive, contrary to the requirements of CEQA.
23 51. By failing to provide adequate responses to public comments and proposed
24 alternatives, Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law. Moreover,
25 Respondents' finding that adequate responses to comments were provided is not supported by
26 substantial evidence.

FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (VIOLATION OF CEQA: Unsupported Statement of Overriding Considerations)

3 52. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth

4 above.

5 53. The City Planning Commission was not the decision-making body of the City and
6 thus the statement of overriding considerations was not properly adopted pursuant to CEQA's
7 requirements until the City Council's action became effective on June 20, 2018.
8 54. The City never adopted the specific procedures required under CEQA to delegate

9 authority to the City Planning Commission to adopt a statement of overriding considerations.
10 55. Even if the City had adopted such procedures, they were defective in that the City
11
8 could not lawfully separate adoption of a statement of overriding considerations from adoption
Channel Law Group, LLP 1706 2A0 VPNST AHSIAA COZ8 Beverly Hills, 12 of the required findings, certification of the FEIR, approval of the Project, the effective ability to
13 consider and adopt mitigation measures.
14 56. Prior to approving a project for which an EIR has been certified, CEQA requires
15 the lead agency to adopt one of three possible findings concerning each significant impact
16 identified in the EIR ("CEQA Findings"). The CEQA Findings must be supported by substantial
17 evidence in the administrative record of proceedings.

18 57. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by failing to proceed in the
19 manner required by law by adopting CEQA Findings that are not supported by substantial

20 evidence. For example, Respondent failed to provide substantial evidence of the Project's

21 purported multi-modal transit impacts, thereby precluding accurate conclusions concerning the

22 minimization of such impacts.

23 58. Where a significant impact cannot be mitigated to a less-than-significant level,

24 CEQA allows a lead agency to adopt what is known as a "statement of overriding
considerations." (Public Resources Code § 21081, subd. (b).)
