N m tu N co Petitioner PUBLIC INTEREST COALTION (*Petitioner") alleges:

1. By this action, Petitioner challenges Respondent CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME
COMMISSION'S ("Respondent" or "Commission") December 6, 2017, modification of Title 14
California Code of Regulations, section 265(d)(1) deleting the provision prohibiting the use of
treeing switches and section 265(d)(2) deleting the provision prohibiting the use of global
positioning system (GPS) equipped dog collars (*Project"); and the Commission's failure to
prepare an Environmental Document in violation of the California Environmental Quality Act
("CEQA"), Public Resources Code, section 21000 et seq. and in violation of the Commission's

9 Certified Regulatory Program under CEQA. (Title 14, California Code Regulations, § 781.5.)

10 2. In seeking to approve the use of GPS collars and tree switches for the use of

11 hunting mammals, the Commission failed to conduct the appropriate environmental review as

12 required by CEQA. The Commission's reliance on the common sense exemption violates

13 CEQA and constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

14 3. The Commission failed to address the issues originally raised in the Petition for

15 Writ of Mandate in Public Interest Coalition v. California Fish and Game Commission,

16 Sacramento County Superior Court, Case No. 34-2016-80002350 and once again seeks avoid

17 environmental review. Instead of addressing the environmental impacts of allowing the use of

18 GPS dog collars and tree switches, the Commission asserts the "common sense exemption"

19 pursuant to CEQA Guidelines, § 15061(b)(3). As discussed below, the "common sense"

20 exemption does not apply and reliance upon the exemption violates CEQA.

21 4. Petitioner seeks a determination from this Court that Respondents' modification of

22 section 265(d)(1) and 265(d)(2) violates Fish and Game Code section 3960 and that the reliance

23 on the common sense exemption violates requirements of CEQA, and the CEQA Guidelines,

et seq. 24 Title 14, California Code of Regulations, section 15000

PARTIES 25

26 5. Petitioner Public Interest Coalition is an unincorporated association working to

27 protect and improve California's the environmental quality, including its wildlife and public trusti

28 resources. Petitioner is committed to the environmental values and well-being of California and
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 2

its citizens. Petitioner is composed of persons whose personal, aesthetic, and environmental

2 interests will be severely injured if the Respondents modification of sections 265(d)(1) and
u p w 265(d)(2) are not set aside. Petitioner's members utilize and enjoy the State's natural resources.
Petitioner brings this petition on behalf of all others similarly situated who are too numerous to
be named and brought before this court as petitioners. As a group composed of residents and
citizens of California, Petitioner is within the class of persons beneficially interested in, and
0 aggrieved by Respondent's acts as alleged below. Petitioner and its members participated in the

co administrative processes herein, and exhausted all remedies.

9 6. Respondent California Fish and Game Commission ("Commission") is a political

10 subdivision of the State of California. The Commission has the responsibility for promul gating

11 regulations to manage sport fishing and hunting. As lead agency for the Project, the Commission

12 is responsible for preparation of an environmental document that describes the Project and its

13 impacts, and, if necessary evaluates mitigation measures and/or alternatives to lessen or avoid

14 any significant environmental impacts. The Commission is responsible for implementing and

15 complying with the provisions of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines with respect to the Project.

16 7. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents identified

17 as Does 1-20. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Respondents

18 Does 1-20, inclusive, are individuals, entities or agencies with material interests affected by the

19 Project with respect to the Project or by Respondents' actions with respect to the Project.

20 When the true identities and capacities of these Respondents have been determined, Petitioner

21 will, with leave of Court if necessary, amend this Petition to insert such identities and

22 capacities.

23 BACKGROUND FACTS

24 A. CALIFORNIA LAW PROHIBITS THE USE OF DOGS TO PURSUE BEAR AND BOBCAT

25 8. In 2012, the California legislature enacted Senate Bill 1221, which prohibits the use

26 of dogs to pursue bear and bobcat. (Fish & Game Code, § 3960.) California law continues to

27 allow the use of dogs for hunting wild pigs and deer.

28
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 3

1 B. THE COMMISSION'S APRIL 2016 MODIFICATION OF REGULATIONS REGARDING USE

2 OF DOGS

m t  0 [ 9. Title 14, California Code of Regulation, section 265(d) prohibited the use of tree
switches and the use of global positioning system equipment on dogs used for the pursuit/take of
mammals. Section 265(d) stated:

(1) Treeing Switches. Electronic retrieval collars containing functioning treeing switches (devices consisting of a switch mechanism that result in a change in the transmitted signals when the dog raises its head to a treed animal) are prohibited on dogs used for the pursuit/take of mammals.
(2) Global Position System Equipment. Electronic dog retrieval collars employing the use of global positioning system equipment (devices that 10 utilize satellite transmissions) are prohibited on dogs used for the
11 pursuit/take of mammals.

12 10. On November 2,2015, the Commission released the Initial Statement of Reasons

13 for Regulatory Action ("ISOR"), proposing to delete section 265(d)(I) (prohibiting the use of

14 tree switches); and section 265(d)(2) (prohibiting the use of global positioning system equipped

15 dog collars.

16 11. With respect to the tree switches, the ISOR for the April 2016 modification stated

17 that the provision is no longer necessary because the equipment might only be used when

18 pursuing an animal that can climb, such as a bear or bobcat. The Commission argued that since

19 the legislature recently restricted the use of dogs and prohibited the pursuit of bear and bobcat
with dogs, the prohibition on tree switches is unnecessary. 20

21 12. With respect to GPS equipment, the ISOR for the April 2016 modification asserts

22 that the prohibition is no longer necessary and increases the possibility that downed game (wild

23 pigs and deer) may be lost to the hunter creating waste. The ISOR also claimed that GPS

24 equipped collars would also aid in the retrieval of lost dogs.

25 13. On April 14, 2016, the Commission approved the amendments to section 265,

26 which provided for deleting: a) section 265(d)(1) provisions that prohibit the use of treeing

27 switches; b) section 265(d)(2) and the prohibition of the use of global positioning system (GPS)

28 equipped dog collars.
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 4

- 14. The Commission concluded that the deletion of section 265(d)(I) and section

t m tunop 265(d)(2) would have no negative impact on the environment and no mitigation measures are

needed.

15. On April 15,2016, the Commission filed a Notice of Determination with the
Resources Agency of California.

16. On May 16, 2016, Public Interest Coalition filed a Petition for Writ of Mandate in
Sacramento County Superior Court on the grounds that the Commission's amendments to
c section 265 violated the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act, Public

9 Resources Code, sections 21000 et seq. and violated the Commission's Certified Regulatory

10 Program under CEQA. (Title 14, California Code Regulations, § 781.5.) (See Public Interest

11 Coalition v. California Fish and Game Commission, Sacramento County Superior Court, Case

12 No. 34-2016-80002350.)

13 17. In response to the Petition for Writ of Mandate, Public Interest Coalition and the

14 Commission entered into a stay to provide the Commission the opportunity to amend the

15 regulations and conduct appropriate environmental review in a manner that would address the

16 issues raised in the Petition for Writ of Mandate. The purpose of the stay was to provide the

17 Commission the time and opportunity to repeal the regulations and then to conduct the

18 appropriate CEQA analysis that it had originally failed to do in amending regulation section

19 265(d).

20 18. In response to the Commission's decision to repeal the regulations, the Public

21 Interest Coalition dismissed the Petition for Writ of Mandate.

22 C. THE COMMISSION'S SUBSEQUENT REGULATIONS REGARDING GPS COLLARS AND

23 TREE SWITCHES

24

25 19. In December 2016, the Commission directed staff to prepare a notice of intent to

26 again amend Section 265 to reinstate the prohibition on the use of GPS collars and treeing

27 switches.

28 20. At its April 26, 2017 meeting, the Commission adopted the changes to Section 265
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 5

prohibiting the use of GPS collars and treeing switches on dog collars for dogs used in the

2 pursuit/take of mammals, with an effective date of April 26, 2018. The Commission approved a
mv1o Notice of Exemption regarding the changes to Section 265.

21. Also at the meeting, April 26, 2017 meeting, the Commission authorized
publication of a notice of its intent to amend Section 265 to delete the prohibitions related to
GPS and treeing switches for dog collars.

7 22. At the Commission's December 6, 2017 meeting, the Commission re-enacted the

g regulations to allow the use of GPS collars and tree switches.

9 23, In re-enacting the regulation to allow the use of GPS collars and tree switches, the
e N0t Commission asserted a "common sense exemption" and approved a Notice of Exemption.

24. On January 4, 2018, the Commission filed a Notice a of Exemption with State
Clearinghouse.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE

25. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to
15 Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, and Public Resources Code section 21168.5. In the

16 alternati ve, this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and

17 Public Resources Code section 21168.

18 26. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 401, venue is proper in this Court

19 because the California Fish and Game Commission is located in the County of Sacramento.

20 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES
AND INADEQUACY OF REMEDY 21

22 27. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant action
23 and has exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.
24 28. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code, section
25 211675 by mailing written notice of this action to the Respondents. A copy of this written
26 notice and proof of service are attached as Exhibit A to this Petition for Writ of Mandate.
27

6 28
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

29. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.6 by
Nm tno concurrently filing a request concerning preparation of the record of administrative proceedings
relating to this action.

30. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate requiring the Commission to set aside
approval of the Project and the Notice of Exemption. In the absence of such remedies,
Respondents' approval will remain in effect in violation of State law.

31. This action has been brought within 35 days of the Commission's filing of the

9 Notice of Exemption as required by Public Resources Code section 21167(d).
STANDING 10

I1 32. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because

12 Petitioner and its members' environmental interests are directly and adversely affected by

13 Commission's decision to amend/delete sections 265(d)(l) and 265(d)(2) of Title 14 California

14 Code of Regulations.

CAUSES OF ACTION 15
9 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
17 (Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act)

18 33. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 32,

19 inclusive, of this Petition, as if fully set forth below.

20 34. The Commission's action in determining the Project is exempt constitutes a

21 violation of CEQA in that the Commission failed to proceed in a manner required by law and

22 the Commission's decision to approve the regulations based upon a common sense exemption is

23 not supported substantial evidence and is contrary to law.

24 35. The Commission's review under CEQA is pursuant to the Commission's Certified

25 Regulatory Program (*CRP") approved by the Secretary for the California Resources Agency

26 pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21080.5. (See generally Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, §§

27 781.5, and 15251, subd. (b).). CEQA requires that all public agencies evaluate the

7 28
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

cJOuAW N environmental impacts of projects they approve, including regulations, which may have a
potential to significantly affect the environment.

36. Under the Commission's CRP, when the Department of Fish and Wildlife submits
a recommendation to the Commission with regard to adopting regulations which may have a
significant etfect on the environment, or it is anticipated that a substantial body of opinion will
reasonably consider the environmental effect to be adverse. the Department's recommendation
shall be presented in written form containing: (I) The proposal; (2) Reasonable alternatives to

9 the proposal, and (3) Mitigation measures to minimize any significant adverse environmental
impacts of the proposal.

10 37.

11 The Commission's regulations provide that the Commission will not adopt

12 regulations as proposed if there are feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures

13 available which would substantially lessen any significant adverse impact which the activity

14 may have on the environment, unless specific economic, social or other conditions make

15 infeasible such project alternatives or such mitigation measures. (Title 14, Cal. Code Reg., §
781.5(g).)

16 38.

17 In adopting the regulations allowing for the use of GPS collars and tree switches,

18 the Commission asserted that the approval qualified for the "common sense exemption" under
CEQA Guidelines section 15061(b)(3).

19 39.

20 The "common sense" exemption can be used "only in those situations where its

21 absolute and precise language clearly applies." (Myers v. Board of Supervisors (1976) 58

22 | Cal.App.3d 413,425.) CEQA exemptions are to be narrowly construed. (Wildlife Alive V.

23 Chickering (1976) 18 Cal.3d 190, 205-206.) "The exemption can be relied on only if a factual

24 evaluation of the agency's proposed activity reveals that it applies." (Muzzy Ranch Co. v.

25 Solano County Airport Land Use Commission (2007) 41 Cal.41h 372, 386.) The agency must

26 make the required determination that there is no possibility that the activity in question may

27 have a significant effect. Moreover, the agency must make a factual review of the record to

28 determine whether the exemption applies. (Id.) As such, "whether a particular activity qualifies
for the common sense exemption presents an issue of fact, and the agency invoking the
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 8

exemption has the burden of demonstrating that it applies." (ld. at 386; See CREED-21 v. City

1 mtDp of San Diego (2015) 234 Cal.App.4h 488,510.) Thus, "the agency's exemption determination
must rely on evidence in the record demonstrating that the agency considered possible
environmental impacts in reaching its decision." (Muzzy Ranch, supra, 41 Cal.4h at 386-387;
quoting Davidon Homes v. City of San Jose (1997) 54 Cal.App.4h 106, 117.) "The question
whether alleged physical changes are reasonably foreseeable requires an examination of the
evidence presented in the administrative record." (Muzzy Ranch, supra, 41 Cal.4th at 387,

8 quoting Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. City of Turlock (2006) 138 Cal.App.4 273,291.)

9 40. Courts have consistently rejected claims of exemption when it is clear that the

10 activity may result in environmental impacts. (Rominger v. County of Colusa (2014) 229

11 Cal.App.4'lh 690, 704 (common sense exemption could not apply to the approval of a

12 subdivision map, which by definition anticipates some future development); see also Wildlife

13 Alive v. Chickering (1976) 18 Cal.3d 190 (Fish & Game Commission action setting fishing and

14 hunting seasons has potential for both beneficial and adverse effects on survival of certain

15 species); Building Code Action v. Energy Resources Conservation & Development Commission

16 (1980) 102 Cal.App.3d 577 (adoption of energy conservation regulations establishing double-

17 glazing standards for new residential construction could have significant impact on air quality

18 as result of increased glass production).)

19 41. The record demonstrates that the use of GPS collars and tree switches may result

20 in impacts to non-target species, which constitutes physical environmental impact. Moreover,

21 the record does not support a determination that there is no possibility that allowing GPS dog

22 collars and tree switches could have significant effect on the environment.. The record

23 demonstrates that the use of dog collars and tree switches result in an unfair advantage in the

24 pursuit of wildlife. The comments also discuss that the use of GPS collars and tree switches

25 impact non-target species and put wildlife at risk. The use of GPS collars and tree switches

26 may result in increased hunting activity or an increase in the range in which the hunting dogs

27 are sent and may go after other species, such as bear, bobcat, bighorn sheep, antelope, and

28 mountain loins.
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 9

42. The Commission's action in approving the modifications to section 265(d)(I) and
265(d)(2) based upon a "common sense exemption" violates CEQA in that the Commission

prepare failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and the Commission's decision not to
v0n an Environmental Document is not supported by substantial evidence in the record.

43. Based upon each of the foregoing reasons, the Commission prejudicially abused its
discretion in violation of CEQA in approving the amended regulations. As such, the Court
should issue a writ of mandate directing Commission to set aside its decision to amend section
ca 265(d)(1) and 265(d)(2).

9
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION 6 g (Violation of the Fish and Game Code, § 3960)

44. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 43,
inclusive, of this Petition, as if fully set forth below.
13 45. Fish and Game Code section 3960 prohibits the use of dogs to pursue bear and
14 bobcat. (Fish & Game Code, § 3960.)
15 46. Fish and Game Code section 3960 requires dog owners to maintain reasonable

16 control of the animal. Section 3960 also provides the Department of Fish and Wildlife the

17 authority to (a) capture any dog not under the reasonable control of its owner or handler, when

18 that uncontrolled dog is pursuing any big game mammal, any bear or bobcat, or any fully

19 protected, rare, or endangered mammal; (b) Capture or dispatch any dog inflicting injury or

20 immediately threatening to inflict injury to any big game mammal during the closed season on

21 that mammal, and the department may capture or dispatch any dog inflicting injury or
22 immediately threatening to inflict injury on any bear or bobcat at any time, or any fully
23 protected, rare, or endangered mammal at any time; and (c) to capture or dispatch any dog
24 inflicting injury or immediately threatening to inflict injury to any mammal in a game refuge or

25 ecological reserve if hunting within that refuge or ecological reserve is unlawful.

26 47. In 2009, in response to a proposal to amend section 265 to delete the ban on GPS

27 collars and tree switches, the Commission's Initial Statement of Reasons ("ISOR") stated:

10 28
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

N- If the treeing switch were allowed, the hunter would have no need to follow the
dogs on foot during the chase. The hunter could just wait until the treeing switch
went off and walk to the tree and find the treed animal and dogs with telemetry
equipment. Without the use of a treeing switch device, the hunter is required to follow the dogs on foot and be with the dogs when an animal is treed or be close enough to hear the barking of the dogs to determine if an animal is treed. The use of treeing switches on dog collars would limit the sporting aspect of fair chase.l

48. The released dogs are defacto hunters and are not under the control of the dog
owners. GPS collars do not control dogs. Instead, they allow dogs and the targeted or non-
• 00 targeted animals being chased to range farther from the dog's handler/owner. Thus, by
removing the prohibition on GPS equipped collars and treeing switches, the dogs will be
9 allowed to hunt, track, chase, and pursue animals outside the control of the owner/handler. In
10 fact, one of the primary purposes of the GPS equipped collar and treeing switches is to enable
11 the dogs to travel significant distances from the owner/handler, which prevents maintaining
12 reasonable control of the animal.
13 49. As the released hounds are not under the control of their owner/handler, amending
14 section 265(d) violates Fish and Game Code section 3960. Additionally, as GPS equipped
15 collars and treeing switches will provide hunters or poachers the opportunity to use such
16 equipment to hunt bear and bobcats.
17
50. Based upon each of the foregoing reasons, the Commission prejudicially abused its
18 discretion in violation of Fish and Game Code section 3960 in approving the amended
19 regulations. As such, the Court should issue a writ of mandate directing Commission to set
20 aside its decision to amend section 265(d)(1) and 265(d)(2).
~
22 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
(Violation of the Fish and Game Code, § 3008) 23
51. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs I through 50, 24
inclusive, of this Petition, as if fully set forth below. 25
52. Fish and Game Code section 3008 provides: 26

27 The physical control of a dog by its owner while the dog is engaged in hunting in an area where the owner is otherwise authorized to hunt, shall be as required by
28 this code or regulations made pursuant thereto.
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 11

=N0 T1000 53. Removal of the prohibition of GPS equipped collars and treeing switches allows
for the use a of dogs in a manner in which the owner will not have physical control of the dog
while the dog is engaged in hunting.

54. Based upon each of the foregoing reasons, the Commission prejudicially abused its
discretion in violation of Fish and Game Code section 3008 in approving the amended
regulations. As such, the Court should issue a writ of mandate directing Commission to set
aside its decision to amend section 265(d)(1) and 265(d)(2).

FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
O (Violation of the Penal Code, § 597b)
55. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 54, 10

11 inclusive, of this Petition, as if fully set forth below.

56. Penal Code section 597b makes it a misdemeanor to cause any animal, including 12

13 dogs, to fight with any other type of animal for the person's amusement or gain. Section 597b

14 does not contain any exemption for hunting.

57. By removing the prohibition on the use of GPS equipped collars and treeing 15

16 switches, the dogs will be out of the owner's control and be used to hunt, chase, and pursue

17 other types of animals that will result in fights with target animals and non-target animals.

18 Such interaction will result in the dogs fighting with other types of animals for the owner's

19 gain.

58. Based upon each of the foregoing reasons, the Commission pre judicially abused its 20

21 discretion in violation of Penal Code section 597b in approving the amended regulations. As

22 such, the Court should issue a writ of mandate directing Commission to set aside its decision to

23 amend section 265(d)(1) and 265(d)(2).

FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION 24 (Violation of the Fair Chase Doctrine)
25 59. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 58, 26 inclusive, of this Petition, as if fully set forth below.
27

12 28
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

60. California's Fish and Game Code and the Commission's regulations governing
hunting of animals in the State of California are based upon and define the rules of fair chase.

switches violate and contradict the rules of fair chase. The use of GPS equipped collars does
not constitute fair chase by the hunter, but instead it becomes dogs hunting wildlife.

[ discretion in violation of Penal Code section 597b in approving the amended regulations. As

8 such, the Court should issue a writ of mandate directing Commission to set aside its decision to

9 amend section 265(d)(1) and 265(d)(2).
