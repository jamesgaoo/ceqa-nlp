SUMMARY OF CASE 25

26 1. Petitioners Sok H. Nam and Soo H. Lee, husband and wife ("Petitioners") bring

28 21000, et seq., "CEQA") and Government Code §§ 65900 et seq. against Respondents CITY OF

Verified Petition for Writ of Administrative Mandamus

T LA CANADA FLINTRIDGE; CITY OF LA CANADA FLINTRIDGE CITY COUNCIL; CITY

2 OF LA CANADA FLINTRIDGE PLANNING COMMISSION; and DOES 1 through 50,

3 inclusive ("Respondents") challenging the Respondents' decision to grant the request for Hillside

4 Development Permit 15-37 and Second-Floor Review 15-39 (*Project") for 4200 Mesa Vista

5 Drive, La Canada Flintridge ("Property") and adopt a Mitigated Negative Declaration (the

6 "MND') under CEQA. The Project contemplates the construction of a 6,173-square-foot, two-

7 story home in a neighborhood of one-story homes with an average home size of 3,290 square feet.

8 The Project, if completed, would violate several sections of the General Plan of the City of La

9 Canada Flintridge (the "General Plan") and in particular the City of La Canada Flintridge Single-
d'IINNVWIZGNV 10 Family Residential Design Guidelines which are incorporated into the General Plan, as well as

11 Respondents' own zoning ordinances. Moreover, in approving the Project, Respondents exceeded

12 their authority, because the Project incorporates, makes changes to, and is dependent on the use of

13 the private easement for access to the Project by both construction vehicles and emergency

14 vehicles, but neither Petitioners, the fee owners of the easement area, nor the Mesa Vista Drive

c MANHATTAN BEACH, CALIFORNIA 90266 324 MANHATTAN BEACH BLVD., SUITE # 201 ozzi-ele (oLs) 15 Property Owners Committee, who has sole authority over the improvement, maintenance, and

d DINSMORE 16 repair of the easement, gave their approval to the Project or the attendant use of the easement.
17 Despite this, Respondents granted the request and adopted the MND without properly considering

18 and evaluating, inter alia, the land use and planning, geology and soils, transportation and traffic,

19 and cumulative impacts the Project would have. Accordingly, Petitioners seek a writ of

20 administrative mandamus from this Court directed toward Respondents.

21

22 PARTIES

23 2. Petitioners are individuals who own and reside at 4201 Mesa Vista Drive, La

24 Canada Flintridge next door to the Property. The Project has specific and detrimental effects to
25 Petitioners' property and therefore Petitioners are interested parties having objected to the Project

26 and exhausted their administrative remedies, conferring the necessary standing to bring this lawsuit

27 on their own behalf.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 18

19 20. Mesa Vista Drive is a private street branching off from Descanso Drive in the City

20 of La Canada Flintridge.

21 21. Petitioners have owned and resided at 4201 Mesa Vista Drive, directly adjacent to

22 the Property, since September 6, 2013.

23 22. Access to the Property is provided by a paved driveway that is partially contained

24 within an 18-foot-wide easement across Petitioners' property,

25 23. On or about November 12, 2015, the Owners of the Property applied for approval

26 of the Project. The Project involves replacing the existing single-story home on the Property with

27 a 6,173 square foot, two-story home. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that

28 legal owner of the Property is Grandway USDEV I-D. However, on applications for the Project

5
Verified Petition for Writ of Administrative Mandamus

2 and in communications with Petitioners, Respondents, and the public, at various times Alex Chen,

3 Lawrence C. Wang, and Grandway USDEV, LLC have held themselves out as owners of the
Property.

4 24.

5 The Project would result in a home that nearly doubles the neighborhood average
of 3,290 square feet that covers 99% of the allowable building density and also has a floor-area

6

7 ratio of 0.25 that is nearly double the neighborhood average of 0.13. Unlike all other homes in the

8 neighborhood, the Project would result in a home a with windows having a direct line of sight into
Petitioners' property, greatly infringing on Petitioners' expectation of privacy.

9 25.

IOWSNIA SANDELMANN L.L.P. 10 Respondents' General Plan and Land Use Element Policy 5.1.4 mandates that

11 Respondents apply their Residential Design Guidelines to the Project. The Project, if completed,

$9TOS VINHO!TYO 324 MANHATTAN BEACH BLVD., SUITE # 201 would violate the following Residential Design Guidelines, among others:

12

13 a. A two-story structure should not be constructed in a one-story neighborhood unless

14 it is designed to be similar in scale and mass with surrounding structures.

MANHATTAN BEACH, OzZi-gte (310) 15 b. Second floor balconies and decks should be designed and located to minimize the

df 16 loss of privacy for neighboring properties, Place new windows where they will
promote privacy between properties.

17 C. Balconies and decks should not create privacy issues with neighbors.

18

19 d. The size, mass and height of structure should be in proportion to the size of the
property and should also be in scale with nearby structures.

20 e.

21 Buildings should maintain a proportional relationship to buildings on adjoining
properties.

22

23 f. New residences and additions should be compatible in mass and scale to

A

24 surrounding buildings in the neighborhood and with natural site features.

25 finished project should convey a sense of modest single-family scale.
26.

26 Respondents' General Plan at section 9.3.2.2 counsels against mansionization

27 stating, "[t]he construction of new homes or the remodeling of existing homes to much larger

28 homes on small lots may adversely affect the quality of present neighborhoods, as well as have a

considerable impact on the long-term afford ability of the City's housing stock." The Project, if

2 completed, would violate that section of the General Plan.

3 27. On September 26, 2016, Petitioners, through their counsel Martin Burton, formally

4 objected to the Project on the grounds, including, but not limited to, that: a) the Owners had not

5 installed story poles, which would provide critical infoxmation about the impacts of the Project,

6 and that the Respondents were evaluating the impacts of the Project without the critical
7 information that would be provided by story poles; b) that the Project would create a home that

8 was too large for the neighborhood and that would intrude on petitioners' privacy and enjoyment

9 of their own property; and c) that the Respondents had not properly considered the narrow road
'd'TINNVWIIINV! 10 leading up to the property, the steep slopes, and the limited building area in their CBQA analysis

11 exempting the Project from CEQA.

12 28. As a result of Petitioners' objections, Respondents directed that story poles be
13 installed for the Project and Respondent Planning Commission continued its hearing on the Project
18-1220 (oLE) 14 from September 27, 2016 to October 25, 2016.

15 29, On October 24, 2016, Petitioners, through their counsel Martin Burton, formally
d HHOWSNIG 324 MANHATTAN BEACH BLVD., SUITE # 201 MANHATTAN BEACH, CALIFORNIA 90266 16 objected to the Project on the grounds: including, but not limited to, that a) it would violate the
17 Residential Design Guidelines; b) Respondents had not performed a proper CEQA analysis
18 because Respondents were relying on an exemption from CEQA and had failed to evaluate the

19 impact of the extensive excavation and related traffic on Mesa Vista Drive; and e) that the Project

20 would overburden the easement across Petitioners' property.

21 30. As a result of Petitioners' objections, Respondents directed that a Mitigated

22 Negative Declaration, not an exemption, be prepared for the Project and Respondent Planning

23 Commission continued its hearing on the Project from October 25, 2016 to May 23, 2017,
24 31. On May 21, 2017, Petitioners, through their counsel Martin Burton, formally

25 objected to the Project on the same grounds as above, among others, and on the additional grounds

26 that Respondents had not performed a proper CEQA analysis because Respondents cited no
27 specific data to support any findings related to geotechnical evaluations; because Respondents

28 failed to consider whether Mesa Vista Drive could handle the loads and traffic that would be caused

2 to access and turn around at the end of Mesa Vista Drive; and because Respondents failed to

99206 VINHOZITVO 324 MANHATTAN BEACH BLVD., SUITE # 201 12 (*Property") and adopt a Mitigated Negative Declaration (the "MND") under CEQA. The Project

13 contemplates the construction of a 6,173-square-foot, two-story home in a neighborhood of one-

14 story homes with an average home size of 3,290 square feet. The Project, if completed, would
Omtaee •d ozZi-gL8 (0Ls) 15 violate several sections of the General Plan of the City of La Canada Flintridge (the "General

DINSMORE 16 Plan") and in particular the City of La Canada Flintridge Single-Family Residential Design

18 ordinances. Moreover, in approving the Project, Respondents exceeded their authority, because

19 the Project incorporates, makes changes to, and is dependent on the use of the private easement

21 Petitioners, the fee owners of the casement area, nor the Mesa Vista Drive Property Owners

22 Committee, who has sole authority over the improvement, maintenance, and repair of the

23 easement, gave their approval to the Project or the attendant use of the easement. Despite this,
24 Respondents granted the request and adopted the MND without properly considering and

24 Petitioners are individuals who own and reside at 4201 Mesa Vista Drive, La

26 Petitioners' property and therefore Petitioners are interested parties having objected to the Project

27 and exhausted their administrative remedies, conferring the necessary standing to bring this lawsuit

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 18

19 20. Mesa Vista Drive is a private street branching off from Descanso Drive in the City

20 of La Canada Flintridge.

21 21, Petitioners have owned and resided at 4201 Mesa Vista Drive, directly adjacent to
22 the Property, since September 6, 2013,

23 22. Access to the Property is provided by a paved driveway that is partially contained

24 within an 18-foot-wide easement across Petitioners' property,

25 23. On or about November 12, 2015, the Owners of the Property applied for approval

26 of the Project. The Project involves replacing the existing single-story home on the Property with

27 a 6,173 square foot, two-story home. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that

28 legal owner of the Property is Grandway USDEV I-D. However, on applications for the Project

1 and in communications with Petitioners, Respondents, and the public, at various times Alex Chen,

2 Lawrence C. Wang, and Grandway USDEV, LLC have held themselves out as owners of the

3 Property,

4 24. The Project would result in a home that nearly doubles the neighborhood average

5 of 3,290 square feet that covers 99% of the allowable building density and also has a floor-area

6 ratio of 0.25 that is nearly double the neighborhood average of 0.13. Unlike all other homes in the

7 neighborhood, the Project would result in a home with windows having a direct line of sight into

8 Petitioners' property, greatly infringing on Petitioners' expectation of privacy.
25.

10 Respondents apply their Residential Design Guidelines to the Project. The Project, if completed, 9 Respondents' General Plan and Land Use Element Policy 5.1,4 mandates that
'd'TI NNVWIZINV 4 d • 11 would violate the following Residential Design Guidelines, among others:
LOz # ELLINS "OAT8 HOVAS NYLLVHNYW FZE 12 a. A two-story structure should not be constructed in a one-story neighborhood unless

13 it is designed to be similar in scale and mass with surrounding structures.
OZZI-8 LE (OLE) 14 b. Second floor balconies and decks should be designed and located to minimize the

15 loss of privacy for neighboring properties. Place new windows where they will

16 promote privacy between properties.
HHONSNIA 17 C. Balconies and decks should not create privacy issues with neighbors.

18 d. The size, mass and height of a structure should be in proportion to the size of the

property and should also be in scale with nearby structures. 19

20 e Buildings should a maintain a proportional relationship to buildings on adjoining

21 properties.

A 22 f. New residences and additions should be compatible in mass and scale to

23 surrounding buildings in the neighborhood and with natural site features.

24 finished project should convey a sense of modest single-family scale.

25 26. Respondents' General Plan at section 9.3.2,2 counsels against mansionization

26 stating, "[t]he construction of new homes or the remodeling of existing homes to much larger
27 homes on small lots may adversely affect the quality of present neighborhoods, as well as have a

- considerable impact on the long-term afford ability of the City's housing stock." The Project, if

2 completed, would violate that section of the General Plan.

27. On September 26, 2016, Petitioners, through their counsel Martin Burton, formally

4 objected to the Project on the grounds, including, but not limited to, that: a) the Owners had not
installed story poles, which would provide critical information about the impacts of the Project,

6 and that the Respondents were evaluating the impacts of the Project without the critical
information that would be provided by story poles; b) that the Project would create a home that

8 was too large for the neighborhood and that would intrude on petitioners' privacy and enjoyment

9 of their own property; and c) that the Respondents had not properly considered the narrow road

11 exempting the Project from CEQA.

15 29. On October 24, 2016, Petitioners, through their counsel Martin Burton, formally

16 objected to the Project on the grounds: including, but not limited to, that a) it would violate the IHOWSNIa 17 Residential Design Guidelines; b) Respondents had not performed a proper CEQA analysis

18 because Respondents were relying on an exemption from CEQA and had failed to evaluate the

19 impact of the extensive excavation and related traffic on Mesa Vista Drive; and c) that the Project

property. 20 would overburden the easement across Petitioners'

21 30, As a result of Petitioners' objections, Respondents directed that a Mitigated

22 Negative Declaration, not an exemption, be prepared for the Project and Respondent Planning

23 Commission continued its hearing on the Project from October 25, 2016 to May 23, 2017.

24 31. On May 21, 2017, Petitioners, through their counsel Martin Burton, formally

25 objected to the Project on the same grounds as above, among others, and on the additional grounds

26 that Respondents had not performed a proper CEQA analysis because Respondents cited no

27 specific data to support any findings related to geotechnical evaluations; because Respondents

28 failed to consider whether Mesa Vista Drive could handle the loads and traffic that would be caused

3 to access and turn around at the end of Mesa Vista Drive; and because Respondents failed to

Verified Petition for Writ of Administrative Mandamus

1

2

3 LA CANADA FLINTRIDGE; CITY OF LA CANADA FLINTRIDGE CITY COUNCIL; CITY
OF LA CANADA FLINTRIDGE PLANNING COMMISSION; and DOES 1 through 50,

5 inclusive ("Respondents") challenging the Respondents' decision to grant the request for Hillside
4 Development Permit 15-37 and Second-Floor Review 15-39 ("Project") for 4200 Mesa Vista

6

7 Drive, La Canada Flintridge ("Property") and adopt a Mitigated Negative Declaration (the

8 "MND") under CEQA. The Project contemplates the construction of a 6,173-square-foot, two-

9 story home in a neighborhood of one-story homes with an average home size of 3,290 square feet.

SANDELMANN L.L.P. The Project, if completed, would violate several sections of the General Plan of the City of La

324 MANHATTAN BEACH BLVD., SUITE # 201 11 Canada Flintridge (the "General Plan") and in particular the City of La Canada Flintridge Single-

MANHATTAN BEACH, 99706 VINHOJITVO 10 Family Residential Design Guidelines which are incorporated into the General Plan, as well as

12

13 Respondents' own zoning ordinances. Moreover, in approving the Project, Respondents exceeded

zzt-e1g (0Le) 14 their authority, because the Project incorporates, makes changes to, and is dependent on the use of

15 the private casement for access to the Project by both construction vehicles and emergency

o
DINSMORE 16 vehicles, but neither Petitioners, the fee owners of the easement area, nor the Mesa Vista Drive

17 Property Owners Committee, who has sole authority over the improvement, maintenance, and

18 repair of the easement, gave their approval to the Project or the attendant use of the easement.

19 Despite this, Respondents granted the request and adopted the MND without properly considering
and evaluating, inter alia, the land use and planning, geology and soils, transportation and traffic,
and cumulative impacts the Project would have. Accordingly, Petitioners seek a writ of
20 administrative mandamus from this Court directed toward Respondents.
21

22

23 2. PARTIES

24

Respondents apply their Residential Design Guidelines to the Project. The Project, if completed,
would violate the following Residential Design Guidelines, among others:

a.

13
(310) 318-1220 14

15 A two-story structure should not be constructed in a one-story neighborhood unless
it is designed to be similar in scale and mass with surrounding structures.

16

17 b. Second floor balconies and decks should be designed and located to minimize the

C.

18 loss of privacy for neighboring properties. Place new. windows where they will
promote privacy between properties.

19 Balconies and decks should not create privacy issues with neighbors.

20

21 d. The size, mass and height of a structure should be in proportion to the size of the

€. property and should also be in scale with nearby structures.

22 Buildings should maintain a proportional relationship to buildings on adjoining
properties.

23

24

25 f. New residences and additions should be compatible in mass and scale to

26.

26 surrounding buildings in the neighborhood and with natural site features. A
finished project should convey a sense of modest single-family scale.

27

28 Respondents' General Plan at section 9.3.2.2 counsels against mansionization
stating, "[t]he construction of new homes or the remodeling of existing homes to much larger

/// homes on small lots may adversely affect the quality of present neighborhoods, as well as have a

3 considerable impact on the long-term afford ability of the City's housing stock." The Project, if
completed, would violate that section of the General Plan.

27,

4 On September 26, 2016, Petitioners, through their counsel Martin Burton, formally

6 objected to the Project on the grounds, including, but not limited to, that: a) the Owners had not

7 installed story poles, which would provide critical information about the impacts of the Project,

8 and that the Respondents were evaluating the impacts of the Project without the critical

9 information that would be provided by story poles; b) that the Project would create a home that

SANDELMANN L.L.P. 10 was too large for the neighborhood and that would intrude on petitioners' privacy and enjoyment

MANHATTAN BEACH, CALIFORNIA 90268 324 MANHATTAN BEACH BLVD., SUITE # 201 11 of their own property; and c) that the Respondents had not properly considered the narrow road

12 leading up to the property, the steep slopes, and the limited building area in their CEQA analysis
exempting the Project from CEQA.

28.

OZZI-BLE (oLE) 14 As a result of Petitioners' objections, Respondents directed that story poles be
13 installed for the Project and Respondent Planning Commission continued its hearing on the Project

15 from September 27, 2016 to October 25, 2016.

17 On October 24, 2016, Petitioners, through their counsel Martin Burton, formally

18

19 Residential Design Guidelines; b) Respondents had not performed a proper CEQA analysis

20 because Respondents were relying on an exemption from CEQA and had failed to evaluate the

21 impact of the extensive excavation and related traffic on Mesa Vista Drive; and c) that the Project
would overburden the easement across Petitioners' property.
30. As a

22

23 result of Petitioners' objections, Respondents directed that a Mitigated

24 Negative Declaration, not an exemption, be prepared for the Project and Respondent Planning
Commission continued its hearing on the Project from October 25, 2016 to May 23, 2017.

26 On May 21, 2017, Petitioners, through their counsel Martin Burton, formally

27 objected to the Project on the same grounds as above, among others, and on the additional grounds

28 that Respondents had a not performed a proper CEQA analysis because Respondents cited no
specific data to support any findings related to geotechnical evaluations; because Respondents
failed to consider whether Mesa Vista Drive could handle the loads and traffic that would be caused

by the Project, including whether the Project would allow sufficient space for emergency vehicles
