First Amended Verified Petition

1 I.

N INTRODUCTION

1. . Petitioner Legado Del Mar, LLC (*Petitioner" or "Legado") worked for more than six
years to develop an affordable housing project in the lower Playa Del Rey Community of the City of

6 Los Angeles, tailoring the design and reducing the floor area of the proposal to earn widespread

7 support among the community and among the planning staff of Respondent and Defendant City of

8 Los Angeles (the "City"). The Project involved a four-story, 48-foot-high, mixed-use 79,493-square

9 foot building with 72 dwelling units and 6,007 square feet of retail and commercial uses. The Director

10 of Planning (*Director') and the Deputy Advisory Agency (*DAA") approved the Project, as

11 modified, and the City Planning Commission affirmed those approvals, each understanding that

12 affordable multi-family housing in the Coastal Zone, especially with a very low a income component,

13 is difficult to achieve due to the limited availability of land and its high cost. Reflecting the cost, no

14 new affordable housing units have been constructed in the lower Playa Del Rey area in at least the

last decade.

15 2.

16 Legado's proposal ran afoul of a small but vocal minority a of serial development

17 opponents who have routinely opposed, not only density bonus projects, but any affordable housing
in general. These opponents

18 convinced the local City Councilmember that they--and not the 500

19 residents who signed supportive petitions for the proposal, nor the 100 local residents who appeared

20 at public hearings in support of the proposal-represent the community, and induced the City Council

21 to illegally overturn the well-reasoned and supported decisions produced by City staff and affirmed
on appeal by the City Planning Commission.

22 3.

23 The predictable result was a scramble to find any pretext for rejecting the proposal.

24 The Coastal Act became the City's hatchet tool. The resulting City Council decision is devoid of

25 substantial evidentiary support for its purported findings, and represents a morass of

26 mischaracterizations of law and fact. If the City Council's arbitrary, capricious, and discriminatory

27 grant of opponents' appeals is upheld, no affordable housing will be built in the Coastal Zone at any

28 time in the foreseeable future. The Coastal Zone will remain, in effect, an exclusionary zone for

2
First Amended Verified Petition

new affordable housing stock.'

4. Accordingly, Legado hereby petitions this court for a writ of mandate pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure Sections 1094.5 and/or 1085 to set aside the decision of the City of Los Angeles
("City") denying Legado's land use applications to develop a mixed-use affordable housing project

on a commercially zoned site that has remained vacant for several decades.

II.

THE PARTIES AND VENUE

8 5. Legado and Plaintiff Legado Del Mar, LLC IS a limited liability company organized

9 and existing under the laws of the State of California. Legado's principal place of business is in Los

10 Angeles County, California.

11 6. Respondent and Defendant City of Los Angeles ("City" or "Respondent') is a

12 municipal corporation and a charter city, organized and existing under the laws of the State of

13 California, with the capacity to sue and be sued. As used herein, the term "City" includes, but IS not

14 limited to, City employees, agents, officers, boards, commissions, departments, and their members,

15 all equally charged with complying with duties under the City Charter, and with the laws of the State.

16 7. Legado does not know the true names or capacities, whether individual, corporate,

17 associate or otherwise, of Respondent/Defendant Does 1 through 25, inclusive, and therefore sues

18 said Respondents/Defendants under fictitious names. Legado will amend this Petition to show their

19 true names and capacities when and if the same have been ascertained. The City and Does 1-25 are

20 sometimes referred to herein as the "Defendants".

21 8. The Court has general subject matter jurisdiction over state law claims, including the

22 administrative and traditional mandamus claims pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085,

23 1094.5 and Government Code sections 65589.5. The Court has concurrent jurisdiction over Legado's

24 federal law claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Fair Housing Act (FIIA) under 42 U.S.C. § 3613.

25 (Tafflin v. Levitt, 493 U.S. 455, 459-460 (1990).)

26 S

27 Some replacement of lost affordable units on redevelopment sites may occur under the Mello Act; however, those only require replacement of lower-income tenants. They would not increase
28 in the number of affordable units in the Coastal Zone.

9.

2 The Court has personal jurisdiction over Respondents/Defendants pursuant to Code of

Civil Procedure section 410.10.

W 10. Venue for this action properly lies with this Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
Sections 392, 393(b), 394 and 395.

11.
4O Venue is proper in this court because the actions complained of in this Petition, the

7 subject property, and the project took place or is or would be sited in Los Angeles County.

I.

8 FACTS COMMON TO ALL CAUSES OF ACTION

o A. The Property

10 12.

11 Legado is the owner of real property located at 138, 140, and 142 Culver Boulevard

12 and 6911, 6913, 6915, and 6917 Vista Del Mar, in the lower Playa Del Rey area of the City of Los

13 Angeles (the "Subject Property'). The Property consists of eight parcels- roughly comprising a

14 rectangle, partially bisected by an alley, encompassing 50,327 square feet ("s.f.") of gross (pre-

15 Project) lot area. The Property is collectively bounded by Culver Boulevard on the northwest, Vista

16 Del Mar on the east and southeast, and Pacific Avenue/Trolley Place on the southwest. Vista Del Mar

17 Lane, a dedicated public alley also identified as Vista Del Mar Place, partially bisects the Subject

18 Property, running northeast from Pacific Avenue/Trolley Place. No other private properties directly

19 abut the Subject Property, all are separated from the Subject Property by public rights-of-way and

20 therefore would not be subject to any direct effects of height or massing.

13.

21 Alleysincluding Vista Del Mar Lane are intended to provide access to properties,

22 not to provide, parking. Section 80.61 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code ("LAMC«) expressly

23 forbids stopping, standing or parking a vehicle "for any purpose other than the loading or unloading

24 of persons or materials in any alley." Section 89.60 establishes fines for violations of section 80.61.

25 State law also contains such prohibitions: for example, section 22951 of the California Vehicle Code

26 prohibits valet parking in an alley. Therefore, local and State law comprehensively refute any

27 suggestion that Vista Del Mar Lane serves or could serve as a legal parking location for local residents

28 Assessor Parcel Nos. 4116-007-055, -066, -067, -068, -069, -070, -072, and -073.

First Amended Verified Petition

- or visitors. Yet, this argument is at the core of the City Council's findings in rejecting the alley
N vacation.

14. Views across the Subject Property from Vista Del Mar to the ocean are obstructed by
existing residential buildings, some of which reach four stories, west of Vista Del Mar and along
Trolley Place, and commercial and residential buildings north of Culver Boulevard. Broader ocean
views are available from Montreal Street, which is situated on top of the coastal bluffs.

15. The Subject Property historically contained a gas station from approximately 1950 to

8 1956, and then an automobile service station from approximately 1964 to 1982. Since demolition of

9 the service station, the Subject Property remained vacant. Vehicular access to the Subject Property

10 occurs via the surrounding roadways, as well as Vista Del Mar Lane.

11 1. Local Land Use Regulations

12 a. General Plan/Community Plan

13 16. The City's General Plan does not have a city-wide Land Use Element; instead, the

14 City adopted a "Framework Element" that establishes general, city-wide land use guidance and

15 principles, and relies upon individually adopted "Community Plans" to serve as the Land Use Element

16 for discrete geographic areas.

17 17. The Westchester-Playa Del Rey Community Plan (the "Community Plan') governs

18 the area that includes the Subject Property.

19 18. The Community Plan designates the Subject Property for Community Commercial

20 use. As described further below, the designation does not include any specific restriction on height or

21 floor area, and does not restrict residential development in commercial areas.

22 b. Del Rey Lagoon Specific Plan (1982)

23 19. On March 16, 1982, the City Council ("Council") declined to adopt the Del Rey

24 Lagoon Specific Plan (the "Lagoon Plan").3 The Lagoon Plan contained several building regulations

25 that incorporated elements of the Coastal Interpretive Guidelines (discussed below), including height

26

27 Council File Nos. 81-3400 and 81-3512, motion of March 16, 1982; Report of the Planning and Environment Committee, Recommendation 7. 28

5
First Amended Verified Petition

1 limits that change with distance from the tidelands, and originally was intended by the City to become

2 part of the Local Coastal Program for the area.

3 20. That intent was never realized. For the Lagoon Plan to become effective, the California
Coastal Act required the City submit the Lagoon Plan to the California Coastal Commission for
certification. However, when the City did so, the Commission rejected the plan and declined to certify
it without substantial modifications. The City Council refused to accept the limitations the Coastal

7 Commission's modifications, but nevertheless purported to adopt the Lagoon Plan "in concept" and

8 purported to apply the terms of the rejected plan as if they were binding and adopted land use
regulations, in violation of the Coastal Act.

10 21. Although subsequent legislative enactments by the City Council implemented some

11 density, height, and/or use limitations, as described below under Zoning, the City never took any of

12 the further legislative actions contemplated in the Lagoon Plan. (See Case No. CPC 29298.)

13 22. As testified by City Planning staff at the July 28, 2018 City Planning Commission

14 ("CPC) hearing, the City has never applied the project approval procedures that exist for specific

15 plan areas, such as Project Permit Compliance approvals (See, e.g., LAMC §11.5.7) to the areas

16 covered by the Lagoon Plan. Yet, as explained further below, despite the advisory nature of the

17 provisions of the Lagoon Plan, in this case the City Council imposed and applied the height limits

18 found in the Lagoon Plan, which conflicted with subsequently adopted height limits and land use

19 regulations.

20 C. Rezoning (1992)

21 23. In 1992, the City rezoned through validly-adopted legislation some properties almost

22 immediately northeast of the Subject Property, along the north side of Culver Boulevard, from Vista

23 Del Mar to Nicholson Street. (Ord. 167,988.) The affected area did not include the Subject Property.

24 The newly-imposed zoning designation of C4-1D-which, again, did not apply to the Subject

25 Property-included "D« development limitations that limited height to 37 feet, and the floor area ratio

26 to 1:1, similar to some provisions of the Lagoon Plan. The ordinance involved no other properties and

27
Id., Recommendations 1 and 7.
28

6
First Amended Verified Petition

1 implemented no other land use controls similar to those in the Lagoon Plan. (Id.) Thus, when the City

2 saw fit to codify land use controls proposed in the Lagoon Plan, it did so. The City never did so with

3 respect to the Subject Property, instead, as shown below, the City adopted a totally different set of
zoning regulations applicable to the Subject Property.
4n d. Community Plan Update (2004)

24. As described above, the Community Plan comprises the General Plan Land Use
Element for a discrete portion of the Cityhere, Westchester and Playa Del Reyand as such serves
as "the constitution for all future development." Lesher Communications, Inc. v. City of Walnut Creek,
52 Cal.3d 531, 540 (1990).

10 25. Thus, adoption of a Community Plan, like a General Plan, represents a major policy

11 and legislative effort, and the City completed a more than six-year comprehensive planning process-

12 involving planning charettes and bi-monthly community meetings, several public hearings before

13 appointed commissioners and elected legislators, and environmental review under CEQA-to update

14 the Community Plan. (Community Plan, pp. I-3 to I-4.) Unlike the Lagoon Plan, the City adopted by

15 ordinance the updated Community Plan on April 13, 2004.5

16 26. Notably, the Activity Log and the discussion of specific plans in the adopted

17 Community Plan do not include the Lagoon Plan. (Community Plan, p. I-1.) The Community Plan

18 a includes a single reference to the Lagoon Plan as a "policy document to be considered (Policy 18-

19 1.1) but, unlike the policy initiatives of adopted specific plans, it implements no portion of the Lagoon

20 Plan and references no specific measures or land use regulations contained within the Lagoon Plan.

21 27. The Community Plan contains a substantial policy framework dedicated to promoting

22 housing, particularly affordable housing. (See Exhibit "A" to this petition.) Specifically, Objective

23 1-4 prioritizes increased accessibility to housing across all population segments. Policies developed

24 to advance this objective include promoting greater choice in type, quality and price; promoting low-

25 and moderate-income housing; ensuring displacement of residents; and developing mixed-use

26 projects in commercial zones and in pedestrian-oriented areas. (Community Plan, Policies 1-4.1 to

27
5 Case no. CPC-1998-0010-CPU; Council File no. 04-0297; see Community Plan Activity Log. 28

7
First Amended Verified Petition

1 1-4.4.) As described in further below and in detail in the mitigated negative declaration ("MND*)

2 prepared for the proposed development, each of the iterations of the proposed development fulfilled
w t 1 these and other policies, particularly because it provides housing across the range of the economic
spectrum, within an established commercial corridor, without displacing a single resident or housing

unit.

e. Community Plan Conformance Rezoning (2004)
A 28. The City adopted the comprehensive rezoning effort for the Community Plan Area,

g including the Subject Property, on July 3, 2004.6 As with the 1992 rezoning, additional use limitations

9 were tailored to specific locations via "[Q]" ("qualified) conditions, rather than applied broadly as

10 was recommended in the Lagoon Plan.7

General Rezoning (2004) 11 i.

12 29. In 2004 the City re-zoned the Subject Property and a significant portion of the vicinity,

13 including properties previously rezoned in 1992. The 2004 ordinance included re-designation or

14 assignment of height districts, as well as a substantial quantity of site-specific zoning in the form of

15 "Qé conditions 8 Some of these "Q" conditions imposed height, density, and use limits as restrictive

16 or more restrictive than those proposed in the Lagoon Plan.

17 30. For example, the ordinance zoned Subarea 40, located about one quarter mile

18 northwest of and not including the Subject Property, as [Q]R3-1XL, and "Q" Condition 2 limited 2

19 height to 26 feet, instead of the 30-foot height permitted by the underlying zoning.

20 31. Similarly, "Q" condition 2 for Subarea 100, which comprises a large commercial

21 parcel directly across Culver Boulevard on the north-northwest of the Subject Property (but not

22 including the Subject Property), imposed a height limit of three stories or 36 feet, contrary to the

23 underlying zoning designation of that property as C4-1VL, which otherwise permitted a height limit

24 of three stories or 45 feet.

Id.
27

28

8
First Amended Verified Petition

1 32.

2 Conditions assigned to properties other than the Subject Property also contained

3 specific, targeted height limits: Subarea 120, located northeast of and not including the Subject
Property, was rezoned [Q]C4-1D, but "Q" conditions 6 7 and 7 maintained the 37-foot height limit

Ut established in 1992. The 37-foot-tall commercial building at 309-315 East Culver Boulevard, which

6 some opponents cited as evidence that Lagoon Plan height regulations apply universally with full

7 force, is located in this subarea. Therefore, the 37-foot height limitation exists by virtue of the of "D«
development limitation imposed by zoning, not the Lagoon Plan.

8 33.

9 In contrast, the adopted Venice Coastal Zone Specific Plan (Ord. 175,693, eff. Jan. 19,

10 2004) directly incorporates more elements of the Coastal Interpretive Guidelines (discussed below).

11 Among other features, the plan includes limits on lot consolidations, graduated height limits,

12 enhanced parking requirements and establishment of a parking trust fund. (Venice Coastal Zone

13 Specific Plan, §§ 9, 10, 13.) However, none of the City's subsequent enactments to the Lagoon Plan

14 contain the same limits, demonstrating the City declined to implement the Lagoon Plan as proposed.

15 Therefore, any direct application of the Lagoon Plan to any development within the affected area-

16 including the Subject Propertyis without any regulatory support and therefore arbitrary and

improper.

17 34.

18 Consistent with the designations established in the Community Plan, the City adopted

19 a comprehensive re-zoning plan for the lower Playa Del Rey area, including the Subject Property, in

2004.9

20 35.

21 Unlike the "Q« conditions for other subareas described above, which applied or

22 modified height and use controls that are in some cases similar to those in the Coastal Interpretive

23 Guidelines and Lagoon Plan, the conditions for Subarea 130, which includes the Subject Property,

24 imposed only five site design measures. None of these measures included height, density, or use

25 limitations. Further, the use limitations imposed by "Q" conditions respond to the Coastal Interpretive

26 Guidelines' recommended prohibition of "residential uses on commercial propertiesl° by prohibiting

9

27 Ord. No. 175,981, eff. July 3, 2004.

10
28 The Interpretive Guidelines do not, by their terms, prohibit mixed-use projects in commercial zones, nor does Coastal Commission policy provide any such limitation. Rather, the prohibition

9
First Amended Verified Petition

1 residential uses on the ground floor ("Q" condition 1). That is, the zoning for the Subject Property

2 and its surroundings provides for mixed-use development, rather than prohibiting all residential

3 development on commercial parcels. Therefore, any suggestion of a blanket prohibition on residential
development in commercial areas is simply wrong.
u ii. The Subiect Property

36. The rezoning designated the Subject Property [Q]C4-1VL ("qualified" Commercial,
A Height District 1VL). The zone permits selected commercial uses, as well as residential uses at a

8 density of 1 dwelling unit ("d.u. per 400 s.f. of lot area. The 1VL height district limits height to 45

9 feet and three stories, and permits a floor area ratio ("FAR"; the ratio of building floor area to lot

10 area) of 1.5:1.11 The Subject Property does not lie within the boundary of any adopted specific plan.

11 37. The [Q] conditions adopted as part of the community-wide rezoning for consistency

12 with the then-new Community Plan, establish further, area-specific restrictions upon the underlying

13 C4 zone for the Subject Property.12 Among other restrictions not relevant to the Project, the [Q]

14 conditions for the Subject Property prohibit residential uses on the ground-floor, require building

15 walls to observe a maximum setback from Culver Boulevard of 5 to 15 feet, and require vehicular

16 access from the side or rear of the Subject Property (here, Pacific Avenue/Trolley Place). The [Q]

area. 17 conditions for the Subject Property impose no additional restrictions on height or floor

18 38. This rezoning effort established the current zoning regulations for the Subject

'19 Property. Consistent with the zoning regulations established for other subareas, and as described

20 above, these regulations included some concepts proposed in the Lagoon Plan, but not others.

21 Specifically, the "Qu conditions imposed on the Subject Property did not establish any height limit

22 on the Subject Property other than that provided by the underlying zoning.

23 39. As long recognized by the United Stated Supreme Court, "one legislature cannot

24
on residential uses is consistent with the preference to provide for visitor-serving uses in the 25 commercial zones in coastal areas.

26 11 As the Subject Property encompasses about 41,000 s.f., an FAR of 1.5:1 would permit a building with about 62,000 s.f. "by right." 27

1 abridge the powers of a succeeding legislature." Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 135 (1810). "The

2 correctness of this principle, so far as respects general legislation, can never be controverted.« Id.

3 Further, a legislature is deemed to be aware of previous enactments when considering and approving

4 subsequent legislation. Here, the City's consistent pattern after approving (not adopting) the Lagoon
5 Plan merely "in concept" demonstrates the intent to implement different, more focused land use

6 controls from those in the Lagoon Plan. The Lagoon Plan is not binding and has not consistently been

7 applied by the City and, as described above, implementation of land use controls has occurred through

8 specific development limitations imposed by general and site- or area-specific zoning. Therefore,

9 imposition of land use controls not incorporated into the zoning or specifically stated in the

10 Community Plan-which the City Council attempted here is arbitrary and improper.

11 f. General Plan Housing Element Update (2013)

12 40. On December 3, 2013, the City adopted a comprehensive update of its General Plan

13 Housing Element. Among other things, the Housing Element responds to Regional Housing Needs

14 Assessments published by the Southern California Association of Governments. The Housing

15 Element must demonstrate how the City can meet its projected housing needs, and particularly its

16 low-income housing needs. (See Govt. Code § 65580 et seq.)

17 41. The Housing Element contains an appendix identifying the housing characteristics and

18 opportunities throughout the City, which is attached hereto as Exhibit "B« to this petition. As shown

19 therein, in or around 2013-when Legado first proposed the development-the vicinity of the Subject

20 Property had a zero percent rental vacancy rate. (See Fig. K-8.) That is, even SIX years ago, the

21 City's own supporting data confirms the need for additional housing in the area that includes the

22 Subject Property, as well as the need for affordable housing, of which none is available.

23 42. Worse still, the data also demonstrate the Coastal Zone has remained a virtual

24 exclusion zone for affordable housing units. Appendix G of the Housing Element documents housing

25 production within the Coastal Zone of the City. These tables are attached as Exhibit "C« to this

26 petition. As shown therein, only 455 units were constructed in the Coastal Zone during the thirty year

27 period spanning 1982 to 2012. Of the units constructed from 2006 to 2012, only 30 net new very-

28

11
First Amended Verified Petition

low-income affordable units were constructed, and a total of only 35 affordable units of any kind were

2 constructed. Thus, the eight very low income units proposed by Legado represented a more than 25

3 percent increase in very low income units, and nearly 25 percent of all affordable units constructed
in the Coastal Zone of the City, let alone in the Playa Del Rey area, in which Legado is informed and

5 believes, and on that basis alleges, no net new affordable units have been constructed within the last

decade.

7 g. The Coastal Bluffs Specific Plan (1994)

8 43. Unlike the Lagoon Plan, the City adopted pursuant to an ordinance the Coastal Bluffs

9 Specific Plan, in 1994.13 As shown in the "Subareas" map in the plan, the plan area encompasses the

10 coastal bluffs north and east of the Subject Property, but does not include or apply to any portion of

11 the Subject Property itself. Notwithstanding the lack of applicability of this plan to the Subject

12 Property, the City Council motion on the CDP arbitrarily and illegally applied elements of this plan

13 to the Approved Project as a pretext for denial.

14 2. Site Plan Review

15 44. The LAMC requires Site Plan Review ("SPR$) approval for any project that proposes

16 50,000 or more new square feet or nonresidential, or 50 or more new dwelling units. (§16.05-C.) The

17 purpose of SPR is to assure substantial conformance with the General Plan, community plan, and/or

18 any applicable specific plan; compatibility with existing and future development; provision by

19 residential projects of amenities to improve habitability for residents and minimize impacts to

20 surrounding areas. (§16.05-F.)

21 3. Density Bonus

22 45. Consistent with the State Density Bonus Law (Senate Bill 1818 and Assembly Bill

23 2222, codified at Govt. Code §65915 et seq.; referred to as "SB1818), the Los Angeles Municipal

24 Code ("LAMC«) contains a Density Bonus Ordinance. LAMC Section 12.22-A.25 specifies how a

25 project may qualify for a density bonus, the concessions and incentives to which a qualifying project

26 is entitled, and the process for consideration and approval. (C.f. Govt. Code §65915(b)(1).) The

27

28 13 Ord. No. 170,046, eff. October 6, 1994.

12
First Amended Verified Petition

1 provision of these concessions and incentives, along with reduced parking, is mandatory for the

2 proposed development, because it provides the required ratio of affordable housing units. (Id.)
3 46. Consistent with the command of state law to provide "concessions and incentives" that
A u relieve projects that provide affordable units from land use controls, the LAMC includes a menu of
incentives from which project applicants may choose (§12.22-A.25(f))14, and provides an

6 administrative process for projects that-like the proposed development-include these "on-menu"

7 incentives. (Id. at subd. (g).)

8 47. In addition to the density bonus, incentives and concessions, and process, the Density

9 Bonus Ordinance also provides automatically for reduced parking, according to one of two options.

10 (§12.22-A.25(d).) Parking Option 1 permits the provision of one parking space for each unit of 0-1

11 bedroom, and two parking spaces for each unit of 2-3 bedrooms. (Id. at subd. (d)(1).) Parking Option

12 2 generally pertains to senior housing. (Id. at subd. (d)(2). The proposed development is entitled to

13 reduced parking, in addition to all other incentives and concessions, and the reduced parking does not

14 count toward the number of incentives for which the Modified or Approved Project was otherwise

15 eligible. (Id. at subd. (e).)

16 48. The Density Bonus Ordinance establishes the following thresholds relevant to the

17 Project: if eleven percent of the proposed market-rate units are made affordable to very low income

18 households, as defined by rates published by the State Department of Housing and the City's Housing

19 and Community Investment Department ("HCID*), that project qualifies for a 35 percent density

20 bonus (§12.22-A.25(c)(1)) and up to two incentives (§12.22-A.25(e)(1).

21 49. Density bonus incentives do not and cannot require a General Plan Amendment,

22 variance, or similar relief. As stated in SB1818:

23 "(1) The granting of a concession or incentive shall not require or be interpreted, in and of itself, to require a general plan amendment, local 24 coastal plan amendment, zoning change, study, or other discretionary approval.
25

26
14 See also memoranda dated October 16, 2014 and January 18, 2017 from Michael LoGrande, 27 then Director of City Planning, describing basis for the "on-menu" incentives provided in the

28 Density Bonus Ordinance. We attach the memoranda as Exhibits "D" and "Ee

13
First Amended Verified Petition

1 Further:

2 "(2) Except as provided in subdivisions (d) and (e), the granting of a density bonus shall not require or be interpreted to require the waiver 3 of a local ordinance or provisions of a local ordinance unrelated to development standards.' 4
5 Govt. Code $65915(j). Section 12.22-A.25(g)(2)(c) of the LAMC includes similar language. Thus,

6 under State law, the density bonus and incentives do not violate local plans or regulations, and

7 therefore could not require any relief beyond the underlying entitlements the LAMC and City Charter

8 would have required even in the absence of a density bonus. As this pertains to the Subject Property,
any suggestion that Legado's density bonus request would trigger any need for additional entitlements
9
directly conflicts with State law.
10
4. Housing Accountability Act ("HAA")
11
a. Applicability of the HAA
12
50. The California Legislature found that "California has a housing supply and
13

14 affordability crisis of historic proportions" and that "The excessive cost of the state's housing supply

15 is partially caused by activities and policies of many local governments that limit the approval of

16 housing, increase the cost of land for housing, and require that high fees and exactions be paid by
producers of housing." (Govt. Code § 65589.5(a)(1)(B), (2)(A).)
17
51. In response, the Legislature adopted the Housing Accountability Act (the "HAA") to
18

19 "significantly increase the approval and construction of new housing for all economic segments of
California's communities by meaningfully and effectively curbing the capability of local
20
governments to deny, reduce the density for, or render infeasible housing development projects and 21 emergency shelters." Gov. Code § 65589.5(a)(2)(K). This includes recent reforms, effective January
22
1, 2018, that strengthen the HAA's provisions, expand its applicability, and increase the City's
23

24 liability for violating the HAA. SB167/AB 678 and AB 1515, (Stats. 2017, Ch. 368, 373, 378,

25 codified in Gov. Code 65589.5.)

52. The HAA prohibits a City from disapproving a housing development project,
26

27 including reducing density or imposing conditions comparable a to a density reduction, unless it finds,

28 a based on a preponderance of the evidence, that the project would have an unavoidable impact on

14
First Amended Verified Petition

1

2 public health or safety that cannot be feasibly mitigated in any way other than rejecting the project or
reducing its size. (Govt. Code 65589.5(k).)

3 53.

L The HAA protects housing or mixed use projects that comply with certain objective

5 general plan, zoning and subdivision standards, regardless of whether or not they provide affordable

6 housing. Honchariw v. City of Stanislaus, 200 Cal. App. 4th 1066, 1070 (2011) ("Honchariw).

7 Projects with at least 20 percent affordable housing for low income households or 100 percent

8 affordable for moderate income households retain additional protection under the HAA, even if the

9 projects do not comply with the zoning standards. (Govt. Code § 65589.5(d)(5)(A).)

b. Housing Development Definition

10 54.

11 A mixed use project qualifies as a "housing development project" under the HAA, if

12 It consists of residential and non-residential uses with at least two thirds of the square footage

13 designated for residential use. (Govt. Code § 65589.5(h)(2)(B).) The Approved Project was a four-

14 story, 48-foot-high, mixed-use 79,493-s.f. building with 72 d.u. and 6,007 square feet of retail and

15 commercial uses, which equates to less than ten percent of the total square footage being commercial

16 uses, and therefore qualifies as a housing development project under the HAA. The Project also

17 8 includes 8 d.u. affordable to very low income households, which is 12.5 percent of the 64 base units,
and qualifies for a density bonus under State Law. (Govt. Code § 65915.)

18 C. Objective Standards

19 55.

20 The HAA requires that the proposed housing development comply with "applicable,

21 objective general plan, zoning and subdivision standards and criteria, including design review

22 standards, in effect at the time that the housing development project's application is deemed to be

23 complete ..." (Govt. Code § 65589.5(j)(1).) The proposed mixed use Project is zoned [Q]C4-1VL

24 with a General Commercial designation, a which permits a height of 45 feet and three stories, a floor

25 area ratio of 1.5:1, certain commercial uses on the ground level, and upper level residential density at

26 a rate of one unit per 400 square feet of floor area, permitting up to 104 d.u. The density bonus

27 incentives allow an increase in height to 56 feet and 4 stories, an increase in floor area ratio to 3:1,

28 and up to 140 d.u. The proposed Project proposes a 48-foot maximum height, and a floor area of

15
First Amended Verified Petition

1 79,493 s.f., for an FAR of 1.9:1, as well as 72 d.u., each of which fully complies with the objective

2 administrative criteria for the entitlements, including the requested Tentative Tract Map, SPR,

3 Density Bonus and CDP.

4 56. The HAA protects all housing projects, and particularly density bonus projects, and
5 states that "the receipt of a density bonus pursuant to Section 65915 shall not constitute a valid basis

6 on which to find a proposed housing development project is inconsistent, not in compliance, or not in

7 conformity, with an applicable plan, program, policy, ordinance, standard, requirement, or other

8 similar provision specified in this subdivision." (Govt. Code § 65589.5(d)(5)(A).) Therefore,

9 approval of a density bonus for the Project is consistent with the required object standards of the

10 HAA.

11 d. Denial Only for Health and Safety Reasons

12 57. Pursuant to the HAA, when a housing development project complies with the objective

13 standards, the City may not disapprove the project or reduce its density, unless the project would have

14 "an unavoidable impact on public health or safety that cannot be mitigated in any way other than

15 rejecting the project or reducing its size." (Govt. Code § 65589.5(k).) The HAA narrowly defines the

16 public health and safety exception as a "specific, adverse impact" that is a "significant, quantifiable,

17 direct, and unavoidable impact, based on objective, identified written public health or safety

18 standards, policies, or conditions as they existed on the date the application was deemed complete.«

19 (Govt. Code § 65589.5(j)(1).) The findings must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence,

20 rather than the more deferential substantial evidence standard, and the City bears the burden to

21 demonstrate that the evidence supporting its conclusion is greater than the evidence to the contrary.

22 58. The City Council's denial of the housing development project was not based on a

23 preponderance of evidence in the record, and did not make any of the findings of a specific, adverse

24 impact to public health and safety. The City Council's discussion focused on the aesthetics of the

25 project, including character and views, water quality, traffic and parking. The City Council found

26 that the Project was not consistent with neighborhood character, based on information on the range

27 of intensities and building heights in the vicinity and a list of building heights in the lower Playa Del

28
16
First Amended Verified Petition

1 Rey area. The City Council also failed to consider potential mitigation for the alleged impacts to

2 water quality, traffic and parking, and instead denied the Project outright.

ta 59. The City may not utilize subjective criteria, such as suitability or compatibility, to
support denial of a housing development project. In Honchariw, the Fifth District confirmed that a
n finding by the County that a site is "not physically suitable" for the project is not an allowable reason
6 for denial under the HAA. The Court stated, "A finding by the County, pursuant to County Code

7 section 20.12.140 or Government Code section 66474, that a project site is "not physically suitable"

8 does not relieve the County from compliance with section 65589.5(ij) if the threshold compliance

9 standards of that statute are met and if the County denies approval for reasons other than compliance

10 with "applicable, objective general plan and zoning standards and criteria, including design review

11 standards, in effect ....' ' The Court further elaborated that "suitability" is a subjective, a rather than

12 objective criteria, and was the type of consideration that the HAA was designed to preclude local

13 governments from using when considering housing developments. Honchariw, supra, at 1070, 1076.

14 e. Notice to Applicant

15 60. If the City considers a proposed housing development project to be inconsistent with

16 any of the objective zoning criteria, the HAA requires that it provide the applicant "with written

17 documentation identifying the provision or provisions, and an explanation of the reason or reasons it

18 considers the housing development to be inconsistent, not in compliance, or not in conformity" within

19 30 days of the date the application is determined to be complete for a project containing 150 or fewer

20 housing units. (Govt. Code § 65589.5(j)(2).) The purpose of the notice requirement is to allow the

21 applicant to modify the proposed project to meet the objective criteria prior to agency action on the

22 entitlements. The City failed to notify the Legado at any time in writing that the Project did not meet

23 the City's objective criteria, prior to and including the action to deny the Project, contrary to State

24 law.

25 f. HAA Claims, Fees and Fines

26 61. The HAA states that an applicant may bring an action to enforce the HAA, if the local

27 agency, in violation of subdivision (j), disapproved a housing development project complying with

28

17
First Amended Verified Petition

the applicable objective zoning standards without making the required findings. (Govt. Code
§ 65589.5(k)(1)(A).) The HAA states that the court shall issue an order compelling compliance

3 within 60 days, and shall retain jurisdiction to ensure compliance. (Id.) The court may issue an order
directing the City to approve the housing development project, if the court finds that the City acted in
4 bad faith when disapproving the project. Id.

62. The standard of review requires that a project must be considered consistent with
objective standards as long as "there is substantial evidence that would allow a reasonable person to

8 conclude" that project complies. (Govt. Code § 65589.5(f)(1)(4).) This is a less deferential standard

9 to the City action than the substantial evidence standard; under the HAA, if a project could reasonably

10 be considered consistent with the City's objective standards, the only grounds for City disapproval is

11 an unavoidable public health or safety impact.

12 63. The HAA's revised provisions, effective January 1, 2018, override the holding on

13 attorneys' fees in Honchariw and provide attorneys' fees for prevailing on a claim. The HAA states

14 that the court shall award reasonable attorney's fees, except under extraordinary circumstances.

15 (Govt. Code § 65589.5(k)(1)(A).)

16 64. The HAA also requires the court to impose fees on the City for non-compliance within

17 the 60 days, in an amount not less than $10,000 dollars per housing unit, and based on the court's

18 consideration of the City's progress towards reaching the regional housing need. (Govt. Code

19 § 65589.5(k)(1)(B).) If the court determines that the City acted in bad faith when disapproving the

20 housing development project and failed to carry out the court's order in 60 days, the court shall

21 multiply the fine by a factor of five. (Govt. Code 65589.5(1).)

22 g. Relationship to the California Environmental Quality Act

23 65. The HAA does not supersede the provisions of the California Environmental Quality

24 Act ("CEQA"), but a reviewing court must "harmonize [different] statutes . .. [and] construe them

25 to give force and effect to all of their provisions." Even Zohar Const. & Remodeling, Inc. V. Bellaire
26 Townhouses, LLC, 61 Cal. 4th 830, 838 (2015); Wolmer v. City of Berkeley, 193 Cal.App.4th 1329,

27 1347-50 (2011) (applying to HAA, CEQA and Density Bonus Law). When a housing development

28
18
First Amended Verified Petition

1 project falls under the protection of the HAA, a local agency can no longer deny or reduce the size of

2 a housing project as an available means to reduce environmental impacts under CEQA. Sequoyah

3 Hills Homeowners Ass'n v City of Oakland, 23 Cal.App.4th 704, 714-716 (1992) (holding a lower

4 density project was legally infeasible because the HAA prohibited reducing housing under CEQA

5 review). CEQA states that a lead agency may "exercise only those express or implied powers

6 provided by law other than [CEQA]," Pub. Res. Code § 21044, and "CEQA is just like any other law

7 In that its general provisions may be subject to specific limitations provided in other laws." CEQA

8 Guidelines 15040. Therefore, the City may not deny the Project solely for CEQA impacts, and is

9 required to apply the provisions of the HAA.

10 66. The State Legislature confirmed the above with its passage of AB 3194 (Ch. 243, Stat.

11 2018), which modified section 65915.5(a)(3) of the Government Code to declare the Legislature's

12 intent that specific adverse impacts to health and safety "will arise infrequently."

13 California Coastal Act

14 67. The Property is located within the State-designated Coastal Zone, and therefore is

15 subject to the provisions of the California Coastal Act of 1972 (Pub. Res. Code § 30000 et seq.; the

16 "Coastal Act*). Consequently, development on the Subject Property requires a Coastal Development

17 Permit ("CDP'). (Pub. Res. Code §30600(b); LAMC §12.20.2.)

18 68. Because the Subject Property is located landward of the first public road from the sea,

19 the City retains permitting authority under the Coastal Act. (Id. at §30603(a)(1).) However, because

20 the Subject Property also is located within 300 feet of a coastal bluff, which is located directly across

21 Vista del Mar from the Subject Property, the California Coastal Commission (the "CCC*) also retains

22 permitting authority over, and must issue a CDP for development on, the Subject Property. (Id. at

23 §30603(a)(2).)

24 69. The primary purposes of the Coastal Act are protection and enhancement of the coastal

25 zone environment, as well as "orderly and balanced" use of cultural resources "taking into account

26 the social and economic needs of the people of the state. (PRC $30005.1, subd. (a) and (b); emphasis

27 supplied.)

28

19
First Amended Verified Petition

70. The "social and economic needs" of the Stateincluding and particularly the City of

2 Los Angelesinclude affordable housing, and the Coastal Act forbids the use of the Coastal Act as
3 a means to avoid affordable housing:
"Nothing in this division shall exempt local governments from meeting the requirements of state and federal law with respect to providing low- and moderate-income housing.  or any other obligation related to housing imposed by existing law or any law hereafter enacted."
(PRC §30007; emphasis supplied.) Thus even to the extent SB1818 could be read to defer to the

8 Coastal Act (see Govt. Code §65915(m); Kalnel Gardens, LLC v. City of Los Angeles, 3 Cal. App.
5th 927, 943-44 (2016) ("Kalnel')), the Coastal Act expressly subordinates itself to requirements to
9

10 provide affordable housing or abide by any other requirements related to housing. Read together,
these provisions of SB1818 and the Coastal Act mandate the Coastal Commission or a local agency a
11
to harmonize those respective requirements.
12
71. Indeed, the State Legislature, in adopting Assembly Bill 2797, expressly rejected any
13

14 suggestion in Kalnel to the contrary, stating:
"It is the intent of Legislature in amending subdivision (m) of Section 15 65915 of the Government Code to supersede the holding and dicta in

16 Kalnel Gardens, LLC v. City of Los Angeles that Section 65915 is subordinate to the California Coastal Act of 1976 (Division 20

17 (commencing with Section 30000) of the Public Resources Code). The Legislature's intent is that the two statutes be harmonized ..

18 (Ch. 904, Stat. 2018; Section 1 (uncodified); emphasis supplied.) The law modified section 65915(m)

19 of the Government Code to read:

20 "(m) This section does not supersede or in any way alter or lessen the

21 effect or application of the California Coastal Act of 1976 (Division 20 (commencing with Section 30000) of the Public Resources Code). Any density bonus, concessions, incentives, waivers or reductions of
22 development standards, and parking ratios to which the applicant is entitled under this section shall be permitted in a manner that is
23 consistent with this section and Division 20 (commencing with Section 30000) of the Public Resources Code."
24

25 Thus, the Legislature made clear the command to permit density bonusesand their attendant

26 concessions and incentives--does not stop at the Coastal Zone.

72. As described below, the same principle holds true for the HAA. (Govt. Code §65589.5
27

28 et seq.) This is crucial within the context of the documented lack of availability of rental housing

20
First Amended Verified Petition

I within the vicinity of the Subject Property, and of the vanishingly small number of affordable units
constructed in the Coastal Zone of the City over approximately the last decade: as stated above, the
Approved Project would have represented an approximately 25 percent increase in affordable units
constructed in the Coastal Zone of the City, let alone in Playa Del Rey.

73. Other provisions also mandate harmony between the requirements of the Coastal Act
and affordable housing requirements. Section 30604(g) prioritizes affordable housing in the Coastal

8 Zoneexactly the kind of very-low-income housing proposed by Legadostating:
"The Legislature finds and declares that it is important for the
O commission to encourage the protection of existing and the provision

10 of new affordable housing opportunities for persons of low and moderate income in the coastal zone.'

74.
11 The Coastal Act further operationalizes this command, mandating:

12 "The commission shall encourage housing opportunities for persons of

13 low and moderate income. In reviewing [Density Bonus applications],
the issuing agency, or the commission on appeal, may not require

14 measures that reduce residential densities below the density sought by an applicant if the density sought is within the permitted density or

15 range of density established by local zoning plus the additional density permitted under Section 65915 of the Government Code, unless the

16 issuing agency or the commission on appeal makes a finding, based on substantial evidence in the record, that the density sought by the

17 applicant cannot feasibly be accommodated on the site in a manner that is in conformity with Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 30200) or the certified local coastal program."

18 (§ 30604(f); emphasis supplied.)

19 75.

20 Other sections of the Coastal Act establish that "significant coastal resources" are

21 prioritized for protection, but also that placement and concentration of urban development may

22 override considerations of specific resources. For example, where section 30250(a) generally requires

23 development to occur in already developed areas, section 30007.5 goes even further, and makes
explicit the trade-off described above:

24

25 "[T]he Legislature declares that broader policies which, for example, serve to concentrate development in close proximity to urban and

26 employment centers may be more protective, overall, than specific wildlife habitat and other similar resource policies."

76.
27 The Modified and Approved Projects are consistent with this overriding policy

28 judgement by proposing to develop a previously developed site, which is itself surrounded by

21
First Amended Verified Petition

1 development and located along major commercial corridor.

2 77. Among the protected resources described above are visual resources and scenic vistas.

3 For example, "views to and along the ocean" are considered important resources. (PRC $30251.) In

4 certain, "highly scenic areas" (which usually must be designated), the Coastal Act also protects the
5 character of a project's setting. (PRC §30251.) Conversely, views landward from the ocean are not

6 protected. Schneider v. Calif. Coastal Comm'n., 140 Cal. App. 4th 1339, 1344 (2006). Despite this

7 prohibition, and as described below, the Council motion on the CDP illegally applied this standard to

8 the Approved Project.

9 78. Among other findings, a CDP requires a determination that a project not prejudice the

10 ability of the local agency to prepare Local Coastal Program ("LCP"). (PRC §30604.) Any denial

11 of a project on the basis of such a purported prejudice must include a "specific finding that sets forth

12 the basis for that conclusion." (Id. at subd. (a).) As described below, the City Council motion on the

13 CDP fails to provide a supportable rationale.

14 B. Coastal Commission Regional Interpretive Guidelines

15 79. Nearly 40 years ago, the Coastal Commission issued Regional Interpretive Guidelines

16 to assist local agencies in developing guidelines for projects in the coastal zone. As described below,

17 the Coastal Interpretive Guidelines are not binding, but the City has considered them in its planning

18 process, and incorporated portions into subsequently enacted land use regulations. The City,

19 following the Coastal Commission, applied certain guidelines elsewhere, and subsequently updated

20 the Community Plan and the zoning for the vicinity, including the Subject Property, to reflect these

21 policy judgments. Thus, to the extent a proposed development conforms to the zoning regulations and

22 to the Community Plan, it is consistent with the City's application of the Coastal Interpretive

23 Guidelines. Further, and as described in the City's determination letters for the CDP, recent approvals

24 by the City and Coastal Commission have consistently exceeded the heights stated in the Coastal

25 Interpretive Guidelines, in the same manner as the Approved Project.

26 80. California courts and the Coastal Commission itselfhave already established the

27 advisory nature of the Coastal Interpretive Guidelines. Calif. Coastal Comm'n. v. Office of

28

22
First Amended Verified Petition

I Administrative Law, 210 Cal. App. 3d 758 (1989). The Coastal Commission adopted several Coastal

2 Interpretive Guidelines in and after 1977-the Los Angeles County guidelines were adopted on
m v o October 14, 1980and sometime later the Pacific Legal Foundation asked the State Office of
Administrative Law ("OAL") to determine that the Coastal Interpretive Guidelines were subject to
the State Administrative Procedures Act ("APA'). The OAL agreed and determined the Coastal
Interpretive Guidelines were, pending review, invalid and unenforceable. 210 Cal. App. 3d at 760.
A The Coastal Commission brought legal action to set aside OAL's determination. Id. Notably, the

8 Court of Appeal, in presenting the issues for decision, stated:
vo "both [the Coastal Commission and OALI agree that unless this court rejects the argument that the guidelines are exempt, there 1S nO reason
10 to reach the question of whether the guidelines at issue, as being
neither mandatory nor binding, are "regulations" within the meaning
11 of the APA.«

12 210 Cal. App. 3d at 761 (emphasis supplied). Thus, the Coastal Commission directly stated and courts

13 agreed, over 25 years ago, that the Coastal Interpretive Guidelines were not mandatory. See also

14 Pacific Legal Foundation v. Calif. Coastal Comm'n., 33 Cal. 3d 158 (1982) (holding that Coastal

15 Interpretive Guidelines, as guidelines and not regulations, were exempt from the APA). Further, and

16 as noted by the Court of Appeal, the Coastal Act language regarding the Coastal Interpretive

17 Guidelines specifies their purpose to

18 "assist local governments [and others] how the policies of this division shall by applied provided however, that such guidelines shall not 19 supersede, enlarge, or diminish the powers or authority of any regional commission, the commission, or any other public agency."
20

21 (Pub. Res. Code §30260(a)(3) (emphasis supplied.) These statements also are repeated in the Coastal
Interpretive Guidelines themselves, and the introduction (p. i) further provides, "[i]t is the intent of
22
the Commission that the guidelines be used in a flexible manner with consideration for local and
23

24 regional conditions" (emphasis supplied).
81. Thus, the Coastal Interpretive Guidelines do not cabin the City's discretion to establish
25
land use policies, including for Playa Del Rey. Consistent with this determination, since the 26

27 establishment of the Coastal Interpretive Guidelines, the City has considered or adopted land use
plans in its coastal areas, including Venice and Playa Del Rey. In some cases, the City opted to 28

23
First Amended Verified Petition

1 incorporate elements of the Coastal Interpretive Guidelines, as described above; in others, it did not.

2 In either case, these legislative actions collectively comprise the City's response to guidance.

3 Therefore, compliance with the applicable policies and regulations established by the City (and as
A 4 described throughout, the proposed development complies with all applicable regulations) also
comprises compliance with the City's application of the Coastal Interpretive Guidelines to

6 development.

7 C. The Originally Proposed Project

8 82. In 2012, Legado submitted applications with the City for approval of new, four-story

9 (54-foot-tall), mixed-use building with an FAR of 2.67:1 and 80,886 s.f. of floor area. The ground

10 floor included 16,000 s.f. of commercial uses, including a 6,000-s.f. market, a 3,000-s.f. restaurant,

11 and 7,000 s.f. of retail and similar uses (the "Original Project). The Project also contained 184

12 parking spaces.

13 83. The upper floors contained 72 dwelling units ("d.u.") a in a mix of studio one- and two-

14 bedroom units. 64 du. were proposed as market-rate units. The total number of units proposed was

15 less than the approximately 100 d.u. permitted by the zoning regulations for the Subject Property.

16 1. Density Bonus Request

17 84. Consistent with State law and with the Density Bonus Ordinance, the Project proposed

18 a total of 8 d.u. affordable to families with very low incomes, as defined by State regulations and

19 HCID. The eight affordable units represent 12.5 percent of the 64 market-rate units proposed.

20 Consequently, the ordinance provides for a 35-percent density bonus (§12.22-A.25(c)(1)) and two

21 on-menu incentives (id. at subd. (e)).

22 85. Legado initially selected two on-menu incentives: (1) an increase in height of up to 11

23 feet, including one additional floor (id. at subd. (f)(5)); and (2) an increase in FAR to a maximum of

24 3:1 (subd. (f)(4)). The Department of City Planning (*DCP*) determined the Project qualified for

25 both incentives.

26 86. As described above, the base height permitted by zoning is 45 feet. The Density Bonus

27 height incentive permits a percentage increase in height equal to the percentage density bonus to

28

24
First Amended Verified Petition

1 which a project is entitled. (Subd. (f)(5).) As the Project is entitled to a density bonus of 35 percent,

2 It may receive height increase of 35 percent (here, 16 feet), up to a maximum of 11 feet. Thus, the

3 Project was entitled to a 56-foot height. Further, even if the maximum height were 36 feet, the height
incentive available still would be 11 feet (35 percent of 36 feet is 13 feet).

87. The Density Bonus floor area incentive ordinarily permits a percentage increase in

6 FAR equal to the percentage increase of the density bonus. (Subd. (f)(4)(i).) However, developments

7 on parcels designated Height District 1, fronting a designated Major Highway, qualifying for a density

8 bonus of 35 percent, and located within 1,500 feet of a designated Transit Stop or Major Employment

9 Center, qualify for an FAR of up to 3:1. Major Employment Centers are designated in Figure 7-1 of

10 the City's General Plan Framework Element. As shown in that figure, the LAX Major Employment

11 Center comprises a zone denoted by the dashed line (see Exhibit "F*), and the DCP confirmed the

12 Subject Property lies within 1,500 feet of that zone, and that the proposal qualified for the 3:1 FAR

13 under that incentive.

14 2. Tract Map

15 88. The Project also included a tentative tract map (no. 70786; the "Tract Map*) to effect

16 the combination of the eight parcels that comprise the Subject Property; incorporate the vacation of

17 portions of Culver Boulevard, Pacific Avenue/Trolley Place, and Vista Del Mar Lane; and dedicate

18 land for the Vista Del Mar right-of-way, which at the timeprior to the City's adoption of its recent

19 General Plan Transportation Element ("Mobility 2035€) extended substantially onto the Subject

20 Property. In contrast, the right-of-way for Culver Boulevard was over-dedicated by approximately

21 10 feet, and the right-of-way for Pacific Avenue/Trolley Place was over-dedicated by five feet. A

22 diagram provided to the City to illustrate the originally proposed and required dedications and

23 vacations is attached as Exhibit "G" to this petition: as shown therein, originally required dedications

24 accounted for about 25 percent of the Subject Property's area.

25 4 3. Coastal Development Permit

26 89. As the Subject Property is located within the Coastal Zone, the Original Project

27 included a request for a CDP. (LAMC §12.20.2.)

28

I D. Public Outreach and Project Modifications

2 90. The Neighborhood Council of Westchester-Playa (the "Neighborhood Council),
Board of Directors and its Planning & Land Use Committee ("PLUC«) have repeatedly stated-in
4n public meetings-their blanket opposition to Density Bonus projects. Despite this opposition, Legado
representatives met with Patricia Lyon, the Chair of the Planning and Land Use Committee to discuss

6 the Original Project, Modified Project, and public benefits Legado proposed to provide.

7 91. Legado representatives also appeared before the Neighborhood Council's PLUC on at

8 least three occasions between July 2013 and November 19, 2013.

9 92. During this time, Legado representatives also held a series of small, local meetings

10 with community members and with the staff of the City's Council District 11 (the "Council Office*)

11 to gather opinions regarding potential uses, public benefits, and preferences regarding traffic and

12 roadway improvements. Comments focused on providing more parking, decreasing the height of the

13 structure by at least one floor, and providing public/community benefits. Community members also

14 expressed a preference for a restaurant as part of the Project.

15 93. Legado also caused to be prepared and submitted a traffic impact analysis (*TIA") that

16 evaluated effects of the Original Project, together with other cumulative projects, including the
17 anticipated full build-out of Playa Vista, by far the largest development in the larger project vicinity.

18 The TIA determined that potential impacts to the intersection of Culver Boulevard and Nicholson

19 Street would require mitigation, but no other intersections within the study area would require

20 mitigation. The proposed mitigation for Culver/Nicholson would have increased vehicle capacity at

21 that intersection.

22 94. Consultation with members of the community, including members of the

23 Neighborhood Council, indicated a strong preference against improvements to the Culver/Nicholson

24 intersection. The intersection serves as a thoroughfare from Marina Del Rey and upper Playa Del

25 Rey/Playa Vista, through lower Playa Del Rey, and to West Los Angeles and downtown Los Angeles,

26 and residents of lower Playa Del Rey preferred not to facilitate additional traffic through lower Playa

27 Del Rey by improving flow.

28

26
First Amended Verified Petition

95. In response to public concerns and the earlier PLUC meetings, Legado modified the

2 Original Project, by reducing the commercial square footage to 14,500 s.f. and conditioning it to

3 exclude market uses from its commercial component, thus reducing vehicle trip generation and
associated impacts to less-than-significant levels. The "Modified Project" maintained the unit count
and affordable housing component of the Original Project, and therefore remained entitled to a 35-
percent density bonus, Parking Option 1, and up to two incentives. After extensive consultation with

7 DCP staff, the Reduced Project included two "on-menu" incentives: (1) an increase in height of up to

8 11 feet, including one additional floor (id. at subd. (f)(5)); and (2) an increase in FAR to a maximum

9 of 3:1 (subd. (f)(4)). Staff of the DCP confirmed, after Legado's submittal of the supplemental

10 application, the Project qualified for both incentives. The Modified Project also included the reversion

11 to acreage and the previously requested vacations of Culver Boulevard, Vista Del Mar Lane, and

12 Pacific Avenue/Trolley Place.

13 96. However, the entirety of the proposed building did not reach 56 feet tall. The City

14 demanded Legado implement a form of "transitional height," per LAMC $12.21.1-A.10 due to the

15 existence of a parcel zoned R1 (single-family residential) in the middle of the Trolley Way right-of-

16 way. LAMC §12.21.1-A.10, known as the Transitional Height Ordinance, applies only where the

17 adjacent R zoned property is a "lot." The LAMC defines a "lot" in Sec. 12.03 as follows: "A parcel

18 of land occupied or to be occupied by a use, building or unit group of buildings and accessory

19 buildings and uses..." Clearly, the RI property within the Trolley Way right-of-way, a dedicated

20 public street, is not a "lot" within the meaning of the LAMC. The DCP staff refused to continue to

21 process the Project unless Legado modified its building to conform to this transitional height - that

22 is, limitations in height and step-backs for upper floors. That was wrong and illegal of the DCP to

23 require. Moreover, the Density Bonus Ordinance specifically eliminates the requirement for

24 compliance with those provisions. (LAMC §12.22-A.25(f)(5).) Legado had to succumb to these

25 demands and modify its project accordingly, or suffer severe financial losses due to further delays in

26 processing the project entitlements.

27 97. Based on the presence of this zone, and notwithstanding the above, City staff

28
27
First Amended Verified Petition

1 demanded, based on an unadopted and uncodified "policy," that the Modified Project implement a

2 modified form of the transitional height provisions. DCP staff demanded that any portion of the

3 proposed structure located within 50 feet of the R1 parcel boundary (which is within the right-of-

4 way) not include any additional height. Consequently, the maximum height for that portion of the

5 building is 45 feet (the maximum permitted by the underlying zone). Further, portions of the
vo Modified Project reach only the podium height of about 25 feet in compliance with this requirement.

7 Petitioner now challenges this unlawful and illegal application of the LAMC to its Project.

8 98. Along with the reductions in building height and commercial floor area, Legado

9 modified the Project to include a new mezzanine parking level that would increase the number of

10 parking spaces provided by 33, for a total of 211. The additional parking spaces exceeded the number

11 required by Parking Option 1 of the Density Bonus Ordinance (151 spaces), as well as the otherwise

12 standard parking requirements of the LAMC (178 spaces), and were intended to provide additional,

13 publicly accessible parking near the Playa Del Rey waterfront. Legado designed the mezzanine in

14 such a manner so as not to increase the building height.

15 99. Legado caused to be prepared an update to the TIA to evaluate the Modified Project,

16 and the TIA demonstrated the changes would eliminate the potentially significant impact to

17 Culver/Nicholson. Therefore, the reductions would eliminate any need for mitigation or

18 improvements to that intersection. The DOT reviewed and approved the updated traffic study on or

19 about November 15, 2013.

20 100. On the basis of these proposed changes and the approval of the supplement to the

21 traffic report, the Neighborhood Council PLUC, at its meeting of November 19, 2013, voted to

22 recommend approval of the Project, anticipating adoption of Legado's proposed modifications, as

23 well as three conditions: (1) elimination of the originally proposed tower structures/architectural

24 features, decreasing the height for the Project; (2) inclusion of a construction traffic control program

25 subject to review by DOT; and (3) a public benefits package to be developed by the full board of the

26 Neighborhood Council.

27 101. On or about December 3, 2013, the full Board of the Neighborhood Council met to

28
28
First Amended Verified Petition

consider the Modified Project. It made no decision, and continued its consideration for further

2 discussion of community benefits and associated issues.

102. Subsequent discussions with board members of the Neighborhood Council indicated
demands for additional public benefits would be forthcoming. Based on further discussions over the
course of the following month, it became clear the anticipated requests for benefits included demands
that would add several million dollars to the cost of the Project and thereby render the Modified
Project economically infeasible.

8 103. As a result, Legado's representatives withdrew their request for the support of the

9 Neighborhood Council. In a letter dated January 29, 2014, Legado's representatives made clear that

10 Legado still would honor all commitments made to that date, including reductions in height, provision

11 of public benefits proposed, and the additional public parking.

12 104. Legado honored its commitment to the Neighborhood Council, and in February 2014

13 submitted to the DCP a supplement to the Master Land Use Application for the Modified Project.

14 E. Environmental Review and Public Hearings

15 105. In July 2013, the City prepared an Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration

16 ("MND*) to evaluate the environmental effects of the Project. However, potential changes to the

17 Project and public concerns prompted Legado to urge City Planning staff to review and circulate a

18 more robust analysis, and staff agreed.

19 106. In 2014, the City circulated an expanded MND,'5 including supporting technical

20 studies, to evaluate the potential effects of the Modified Project. The MND concluded the Project,

21 with implementation of mitigation, would not result in any significant unavoidable impacts to the

22 environment.

23 107. During the public circulation period of the MND, members of the public submitted

24 comments regarding a variety of issues. Issues of primary focus included visual resources and views;

25 land use regulations and height limits, particularly the applicability of the Lagoon Plan and the

26 Community Plan; the effects of construction dewatering on groundwater; traffic and parking;

27
15 Case No. ENV-2012-3536-MND-RECI.
28

29
First Amended Verified Petition

1 cumulative development; storm water; and the potential for toxic vapor intrusion.

2 108. On December 10, 2014, the City's Deputy Advisory Agency ("DAA") and the

3 designee of the Director of Planning (the "Director") held a joint public hearing on the Tract Map,

4to Density Bonus, and Site Plan Review approvals. The hearing was well-attended, with testimony
provided both for and against the Modified Project. Comments in opposition generally mirrored the
comments submitted for the MND, with the additional allegation contradicted by title records---that

7 Legado or its predecessors-in-interest did not previously hold a sufficient interest in the rights-of-way

8 Legado sought to vacate.

9 109. Representatives of Council District 11 also testified in opposition to the Modified

10 Project, primarily on the basis of its height exceeding 36 feet. The DAA and Director held the record

11 for the hearing open for submittal of additional information in response to comments provided at the

12 hearing and on the MND.

13 110. On January 29, 2015, the Zoning Administrator ("ZA) conducted a public hearing on

14 the CDP. Despite the Modified Project being subject to the City's Multiple Approvals Ordinance

15 (LAMC §12.36)which dictates simultaneous hearings, as well as issuance of determination letters

16 and appeal periods, for multiple approvalsthe ZA stated at the hearing that the determination letter

17 for the CDP would issue after the determinations for the Tract Map and other requests.

18 111. Staff from Council District 11 appeared at the hearing and testified regarding the

19 Councilmember's opposition to the Modified Project as proposed, primarily and specifically on the

20 basis of the Density Bonus request. Then Planning Deputy (now Deputy Chief of Staff) Tricia Keane

21 characterized the Project as "a misapplication of SB1818," and claimed the Density Bonus request

22 was "not because of a need for more units to provide affordable housing,® but "to make the market

23 rate units significantly larger and the building significantly taller." Ms. Keane further questioned

24 whether the incentives requested were truly "on-menu" and claimed the need for a financial pro-

25 forma analysis. The testimony included no substantial evidence that the incentives requested for the

26 Modified Project were off-menu or otherwise improper; instead, those claims were animated by

27 "systemic concern" with SB1818. Ms. Keane also testified the Modified Project conflicted with the

28

30
First Amended Verified Petition

1 Community Plan, contrary to SB1818.

112. Other testimony disputed the definition of the Modified Project an "affordable housing
project* within the meaning of the SB1818 and Density Bonus Ordinance.

113. Similar to the DAA/Director hearing, the ZA held the record for the hearing open for

submittal of additional information in response to comments and testimony provided at the hearing.

114. The record for both hearings was subsequently extended until about March 13, 2015,
at which time Legado provided extensive responses to public comments, as well as supplemental legal

8 and technical analysis in support of the Modified Project and the MND.

9 115. Legado's submittal included a series of "topical" responses aimed at the most common

10 comment topics, as well as responses, on a comment-by-comment basis, to all letters received.

11 116. To address view shed concerns, the responses included detailed ocean view

12 simulations, based on digital elevation models, from a several locations on Montreal Street, along

13 which commenters claimed sensitive views existed. As shown in those simulations (attached as

14 Exhibits "H" and K'), ocean views from one primary location are blocked by mature vegetation, and

15 other existing ocean views remain even after implementation of the Project. This is true even for

16 views near the base of Montreal Street at its intersection with Vista Del Mar. Thus, the data supported

17 the conclusions of the MND that no significant unavoidable impact to views or view sheds would

18 occur.

19 117. The responses to comments addressed concerns regarding the effects of Project-related

20 dewatering in three primary ways:

21 118. First, the responses clarified that dewatering would only occur during construction,

22 notwithstanding public comments to the contrary. The foundation of the proposed building would be

23 designed to resist the hydraulic pressure of groundwater, consistent with other buildings in the

24 vicinity, including the entire Playa Vista development, south of the Subject Property.

25 119. Second, the responses included groundwater sampling beneath the Subject Property

26 and at nearby locations, including the former Del Rey Cleaner's property, where releases of certain

27 chemicals into groundwater were known to occur. These tests confirmed the chemical plume

28

31
First Amended Verified Petition

remained on the Del Rey Cleaner's property, but had not migrated to 200 Culver, a property within

2 100 feet of the Del Rey Cleaner's, or to 138 Culver. The tests also were conducted under the
supervision of the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board (the "RWQCB*), and Legado
also provided the testing results to that agency;

120. Third, the responses included technical reports that provided the results of testing
designed to replicate the effects of groundwater pumping/dewatering during construction. That is,

7 the studies included limited groundwater extraction from on-site wells to observe the effects that

8 extraction in other, off-site groundwater wells. The results of these tests were presented in a technical

9 report that concluded minimal potential existed for construction dewatering associated with the

10 project to affect the Del Rey Cleaners plume. Further, the plume is located cross-gradient from the

11 Subject Property: that is, the flow of groundwater runs parallel between the two locations, not toward

12 the Subject Property, and the Pacific Ocean presents substantial influence on local groundwater flow.

13 Also, the reports addressed the potential for any hydrological effect on the Ballona Wetlands and

14 concluded, based on the testing, the lack of a hydrological connection, and the groundwater gradient,

15 that no significant impact would occur. Nevertheless, the technical report also outlined potential

16 measures to ensure that any groundwater extraction at the Subject Property remained isolated from

17 its surroundings, if the need arose, including potential treatment of the plume: each of those methods

18 constitutes accepted industry practice.

19 121. As the claimed potential for toxic vapor intrusion was linked to the presence of the

20 groundwater chemical plume, the technical reports also included tests of soils underlying the Subject

21 Property for the presence of chemicals that may intrude into the proposed structure. Testing yielded

22 no evidence of such chemicals in the soils, and the technical reports substantiated the conclusion of

23 the MND that no impact would occur.

24 122. Regarding land use, the responses contained a detailed discussion of the history of the

25 Lagoon Plan, the Interpretive Guidelines, and subsequent updates to the Community Plan and the

26 zoning designations of the Subject Property and its surroundings, as well as the conformance of the

27 Project with applicable requirement. That discussion was summarized above under Land Use

28

32
First Amended Verified Petition

1 Regulations.

2 123. Regarding storm water. the MND included a preliminary storm water report prepared

3 by a civil engineering furm. As stated in the report, the finished grade of the driveways and accessways
would be 15 inches above the curb and gutter flow lines, reducing any potential for flooding under a
1o 50-year storm to a negligible level, and the Subject Property is not located in a 100-year flood zone.
Also, to comply with the City's low impact development standards, the Modified Project includes a

7 system to harvest rainwater, which will further limit runoff and reduce the potential for flooding.

8 124. Regarding the scope of the Modified Project and cumulative projects, opponents

9 asserted that because Legado owns two other properties in lower Playa Del Rey (101 and 200-220

10 Culver Boulevard), any analysis of 138 Culver must include those properties as if the three properties

11 collectively constitute one large project. As described in the responses to comments, no link existed

12 between the properties or any development on those properties, and no plans then existed or currently

13 exist for 101 or 200 Culver Boulevard. Consequently, although development may eventually occur

14 on those properties, the form and extent of that development was speculative, and CEQA did not

15 require consideration of it.

16 125. As of March 2015, the DAA, Director, and ZA had the information required fully to

17 consider the Modified Project and issue determination letters for approval or denial of the requested

18 entitlements. However, Legado is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, the determination

19 letters did not progress; rather, personnel from the Council Office pressured and ultimately instructed

20 DCP staff to halt any processing of Legado's application.

21 F. Legado's Subsequent Attempts to Compromise

22 126. With processing of the entitlements halted, Legado was forced to attempt some kind

23 of compromise to induce the City merely to process a development proposal, and entered into further

24 discussions with staff of the Council Office in or around June 2015. The discussions focused on

25 reducing height and bulk, and Legado prepared concept designs that maintained the already low
area and lowered portions 26 residential density originally proposed, but reduced the commercial floor

27 of the roofline.

28

33
First Amended Verified Petition

1 127. The Council Office indicated some interest in the concepts, but ultimately demanded

2 the development reach only three stories. However, the loss of the entire fourth story would result in
a loss of up to one third of the proposed units, rendering the development-and certainly any
provision of affordable units infeasible.

128. Legado was informed that without the full approval of Project opponents-which was
not forthcoming the Council Office could not support any of the concepts presented. Meanwhile,
7 Legado continued to press on the DCP staff to issue the decisions to which Legado was entitled, but

8 the Project sat idle at the DCP.

129. Overall, Legado's attempts to compromise with the Council Office spanned more

10 than a year, during which time the City did not process any land use entitlements for any proposal

11 by Legado. After more than a year, and threatened litigation by Legado, the Council Office finally

12 informed Legado that the DCP could proceed processing entitlements for the Modified Project.

13 However, the DCP demanded further reductions to the height of the Modified Project as set forth

14 below, and would not agree to issue a decision unless Legado made such changes.

15 G. Subsequent Modifications to the Project

16 130. During the year Legado spent in attempts to compromise with the Council Office, the

17 City adopted a new General Plan Transportation Element, named Mobility 2035. Mobility 2035

18 included, among other things, different roadway classifications and standards for certain types of

19 streets, including Vista Del Mar. Specifically, where Vista Del Mar originally required dedication for

20 additional width, Mobility 2035 planned for no further widening, and the requirement to dedicate no

21 longer applied.

22 131. Because the proposed tract map associated with the Modified Project was not a vesting

23 map, the changes in roadway classifications- and in required dedications-applied to the Modified

24 Project. Therefore, the tract map required revisions to reflect the new lot dimensions and other

25 technical questions, including street cross-sections. This process included submittal of technical

26 corrections and review of the corrections by various City departments, which occurred over the course

27 of several additional months.

28

34
First Amended Verified Petition

132. During the course of ascertaining the revised lot size, as well as the requested roadway

2 vacations in light of Mobility 2035, the Modified Project eliminated the requested five-foot roadway
e vacation for Pacific Avenue/Trolley Place.

133. In addition to technical changes in the tract map, DCP staff determined, based on
' recent Playa Del Rey project approvals by the Coastal Commission, that 37 feet appeared to constitute
6 the maximum height recently approved in the immediate vicinity of the Subject Property, despite the

7 presence of extensive 45-foot development surrounding the nearby Del Rey Lagoon, and therefore

8 that 37 feet likely represented the maximum base height supportable for a density bonus request on

9 the Subject Property.

10 134. Based on this initial determination regarding building height, DCP staff informed

11 Legado that they believed a density bonus project that included a 37-foot base height--and a 48-foot

12 maximum height under the Density Bonus Ordinancewas supportable, and requested drawings and

13 Project characteristics reflecting the same to attach to the determination letters.

14 135. Under such coercion, Legado agreed to revise the design of the proposed building to

15 provide a further reduced development. The resulting design (the "Approved Project*) contained the

16 same number of residences and the affordable housing component of the Original and Modified
Projects. The ground-floor commercial component was reduced by about half, from 14,500 s.f. to 17

18 7,507 s.f., of which up to 1,500 s.f. would comprise a restaurant and 6,007 s.f. would comprise retail.

19 136. The revised height of the structure reached a maximum of 48 feet, in lieu of the

20 proposed 56 feet, though as with the Modified Project, except for portions of the building that the

21 City said were subject to the Transitional Height area, which had to be lower. Rather, like the

22 Modified Project, the Approved Project includes the uncodified "transitional height" scheme

23 demanded by DCP staff, and varies from 15 feet at the podium level, to 37 feet on the portion of the

24 building within 50 feet of the R1-zoned lot located in the middle of Pacific Avenue/Trolley Place

25 right-of-way. Again, this transitional height was provided even though the R1 lot iS not developable

26 with residential uses and, therefore, no single-family residences exist that require direct relief from

27 height.

28

35
First Amended Verified Petition

1 137. To accommodate the reduced height, Legado was forced to eliminate the mezzanine

2 parking level proposed as part of the Modified Project. Also, to further address public concerns

3 regarding groundwater, the Approved Project eliminated the second level of subterranean parking,

4 and provided parking at-grade and in one subterranean level. The elimination of the mezzanine and
the reduction in square footage of the commercial component of the building permitted greater
Vo ground-floor parking, but the elimination of the mezzanine resulted in an overall reduction in parking.
7 Consequently, the Approved Project provided 123 vehicle parking spaces, in compliance with Parking

8 Option 1 of the Density Bonus Ordinance, as well as 84 bicycle parking spaces. Further, the

9 remaining architectural features on the proposed building were eliminated to provide a flat roof. The

10 floor area of the Approved Project encompassed 79,493 s.f. on a net lot area of 41,233 s.f., yielding

11 an FAR of approximately 1.9:1, which is less than the 3:1 for which the Approved Project qualifies

12 and which lies within the 35-percent increase in FAR permitted under any circumstances by the City's

13 "on-menu" FAR incentive.

14 H. The DCP Approvals

15 138. On March 26, 2018, the Director of Planning' and the DAA issued two determination

16 letters granting with conditions the Approved Project, under the LAMC provisions necessary for the

17 construction of the Project, described above. One determination letter was issued for the tract map,

18 and one for the CDP, Density Bonus, Site Plan Review, and Mello Act compliance, but the appeal

19 periods for each letter ran concurrently. The determination letters also adopted the MND. The

20 determination letters contained detailed and extensive findings in support of the actions, with findings

21 alone comprising 20 pages of each letter and specifically addressing the main points raised by

22 opponents.

23 139. The Director's approval determined the Project complied with the Coastal Act and

24 applicable provisions of the LAMC, and included detailed findings to that effect.

25

26 16 In or around 2015, the City's procedures for processing CDPs changed, shifting responsibility from the Office of Zoning Administration to the community planning staff who already
27 processed density bonus and site plan review approvals. All decisionmakers are staff of the
DCP.

1 140. As to conformity of the Project with Chapter 3 of the Coastal Act, the Director found

2 the Project was consistent with 2 Article 2 (Public Access), which prohibits interference with public

3 access to the ocean. Specifically, the DCP determined the proposed merger and vacation of the Culver

4 Boulevard and Vista Del Mar rights-of-way maintained the street standards established by Mobility

5 2035 and implemented by the Bureau of Engineering and DOT, and that the street and streetscape

6 improvements included with the Approved Project implemented the pedestrian-oriented designation

7 of Culver Boulevard. With respect to Article 5 (Land Resources), the determination letters

8 acknowledged the location of the Subject Property within an established area of development, and

9 not within an environmentally sensitive habitat area, and that although the relatively shallow

10 groundwater in the vicinity made the presence of paleontological or archaeological resources

11 unlikely, the Approved Project was conditioned to comply with federal, State, and City regulatory

12 requirements regarding such resources, which would ensure their protection.

13 141. With respect to 6 Article 6 (Development) of the Coastal Act, the determination letters

14 provided that the Approved Project would maintain the character of the surrounding area and would

15 respect existing development. Section 30250 requires new development to be sited contiguously or

16 adjacent to already-developed areas, requires siting new development within or contiguous to

17 developed areas with adequate public services, where it will not have adverse impacts on coastal

18 resources. The Director determined the Approved Project was contiguous with existing development,

19 as it would develop urban uses along Culver Boulevard, a highly urbanized area typified by one- to

20 three-story retail structures. The Director also explained the Subject Property was served by existing

21 infrastructure and was within the designated service areas of the Los Angeles Fire Department

22 ("LAFD") and Los Angeles Police Department ('LAPD').

23 142. With respect to Section 30251 of the Coastal Act, which requires preservation of the

24 scenic and visual qualities of coastal areas, including landforms, and compatibility with scale and

25 character of surrounding development, the determination letter for the CDP described the existing

26 built environment of the vicinity. As stated therein, the Subject Property is flat, previously graded,

27 and does not contain any natural landforms. The Property also is separated from surrounding

28

1 development on all sides by public rights-of-way. The nearby coastal bluff, along which lies a portion

2 of Montreal Street, extends substantially above the elevation of the Subject Property (as stated

cn elsewhere in the record, this coastal bluff extends approximately 80 feet above the Subject Property).
Importantly, as stated in the determination letter, the view shed simulations for the proposed building
a evaluated a 56-foot-tall structure and demonstrated ocean views remain; however, the Approved
Project is eight feet shorter, reducing the already less-than-significant impacts on such views.
A 143. The determination further clarifies the Coastal Bluffs Specific Plan was established to

8 regulate development on the bluffs, and does not apply to the Subject Property.

9 144. As also explained in the determination letter, Vista Del Mar and Culver Boulevard

10 both are locally designated as scenic highways; however, they are designated for their views of

11 specific resources. Culver Boulevard is designated from Vista Del Mar to Ballona Creek (i.e., away

12 from the Subject Property) and designated for views of the ocean and the marina; Vista Del Mar is

13 designated from Culver Boulevard to Imperial Highway, along which the Subject Property is located,

14 for views of sand dunes and the ocean. As stated in the determination letter, no scenic views are

15 maintained by or across the Subject Property, as multi-family and commercial structures surround it.

16 Simply put, the resources for which the scenic designations were adopted are not visible from OT

17 through the Subject Property.

18 145. Regarding scale and character, the Director explained that recent development is

19 characterized by 37-foot heights in the immediate vicinity, though recent development along nearby

20 Esplanade and the Del Rey Lagoon are 45 feet in height, "similar to many existing structures 45 feet

21 In height." (CDP Determination Letter, p. 25 of 42.) Because substantial existing and recent

22 development reached 45 feet in height, the maximum Approved Project height of 48 feet, with a

23 variable height as low as 25 feet,17 a street wall along Culver Boulevard, and extensive articulation at

24 the ground level and the upper-floor residential uses, with substantial breaks in plane to reduce the

25 apparent massing, would blend with existing development and would not represent a significant

26

27 17 The CDP Determination Letter (p. 25 of 42) specifies 25 feet as a minimum building height, but the elevations make clear the minimum height actually is 15 feet.

1 change in the average structure height in the lower Playa Del Rey area. Streetscape improvements, as

2 well as improvements to the public rights-of-way, also would enhance the visual quality of the area,
c ensuring compatibility with Section 30251 of the Coastal Act.

146. The evaluation of consistency with sections 30210, 30211, and 30252, which require
maintenance and enhancement of public access to the coast, cited the provision of new housing,
including affordable housing, adjacent to the coast, as well as improvements to the local street
A network, as well as the provision of visitor-serving commercial uses, with associated public parking

8 that includes electric vehicle parking and bicycle parking. The Director observed the Subject Property

9 IS not located between the first public road and the sea, and that pedestrian access to shoreline areas

10 is maintained by the three roadways that surround the Subject Property. Although the tract map of the

11 Approved Project included vacations of portions of Culver Boulevard, as well as the Vista Del Mar

12 Lane alley, those vacated areas were determined to be excess right-of-way, and after vacation, Culver

13 Boulevard would still meet its specifications under Mobility 2035. Sidewalks would be widened in

14 comparison to existing conditions, and existing lanes of travel and on-street parking would remain.

15 Further, the Approved Project included streetscape improvements for the surrounding roadways,

16 enhancing the access they currently provide. Consequently, public access to the ocean and shoreline

17 areas would not be adversely affected.

18 147. With respect to Section 30253, which requires minimization of risks to life and

19 property in areas of high hazard, as well as protection of "special communities," the Director

20 determined the Subject Property is not located in a designated geologic, flood, or fire hazard area, nor

21 IS the Subject Property located on a bluff or cliff, where land sliding could occur. The Property is

22 located within a tsunami inundation zone, but the MND evaluated the risks of the location and

23 identified mitigation measures and regulatory compliance measures that would ensure impacts related

24 to natural hazards are reduced to less-than-significant levels. The Director further concluded the

25 Approved Project would not result in adverse impacts on access, sensitive habitats, archaeological or
26 paleontological resources, or designated views. The Director also referenced the discussion on

27 building character, and on the basis of those facts and conclusions, determined the Approved Project

28

39
First Amended Verified Petition

conformed to Chapter 3 of the Coastal Act.

148. The Director also concluded the Approved Project would not prejudice the ability of
the City to adopt a Local Coastal Program ("LCP*), according to section 30603(a) of the Coastal Act.
The City has no adopted LCP for Playa Del Rey and the mere approval "in concept" of the Lagoon
Plan, which was originally intended to comprise the LCP; nevertheless, the Director determined that
O because the base height for the density bonus component of the Approved Project was consistent with

7 the Lagoon Plan, at 37 feet, and was otherwise consistent with other development in the area, the

8 Approved Project maintained compatibility with the applicable provisions of the Coastal Act and

9 would not prejudice the ability of the City to adopt an LCP in the future.

10 149. Regarding the requirement to consider the Coastal Interpretive Guidelines in City

11 decisions on CDPs, the Director noted the advisory nature of the Coastal Interpretive Guidelines, but

12 cited guidance regarding building height, public access, wetlands, and vistas, as well as proposed

13 policies within the Lagoon Plan, that the Director considered with respect to the Project. Specifically,

14 the Director noted use of the 37-foot height proposed in the Lagoon Plan as the base for the density

15 bonus request of the Approved Project, rather than the 30-foot height suggested in the Coastal

16 Interpretive Guidelines, in accordance with recent Coastal Commission decisions, and referenced the

17 consistency findings with respect to Article 3 of the Coastal Act, as discussed above. The Director

18 also noted the importance of the density bonus request to promote the development of affordable

19 housing in the Coastal Zone, and its consideration within the context of the buildings recently

20 approved by the Coastal Commission

21 150. The Director further described consideration of recent Coastal Commission decisions

22 in the analysis of the Project, pursuant to section 30625 of the Coastal Act. The CDP determination

23 letter included a table of 14 Coastal Commission decisions from 1998 to 2017 for projects in Playa

24 Del Rey. (Pages 27-28 of 42.) Those approvals included heights that ranged from 33 to 37 feet,

25 consistent with the base height established for the density bonus component of the Approved Project.

26 Thus, even though the Director acknowledged the 45-foot height limit established by the zoning for

27 the Subject Property, and also acknowledged those prior Coastal Commission decisions concerned

28

40
First Amended Verified Petition

I projects not directly comparable to a mixed-use density bonus development, the decision for the

2 Approved Project nevertheless considered prior Coastal Commission decisions and applied the height

c limit provided in the Lagoon Plan.

151. The Director and DAA also adopted the MND for the Modified Project.

5 I. Appeals to the City Planning Commission

152. Ten project opponents submitted timely appeals of one or both determination letters.
7 The appeals generally addressed the same main topics raised in response to the MND and at public

8 hearings before the DAA and the Director, as well as claimed impacts to biological resources, and a

9 dispute of Legado's right to request a reversion to acreage.

10 153. Notably, most appeals failed to address the Approved Project directly; rather, they

11 restated objections to the Modified Project, and mischaracterized SB1818 as requiring some showing

12 of economic need or pro forma analysis to justify the incentives provided.

13 154. The LAMC requires a hearing on appeal of any tract map and related cases within 30

14 days of filing (LAMC $§12.36-C.5; 17.06-A.3; ), and DCP staff informed Legado they were unable

15 properly to prepare and issue staff reports for the appeals within the time allotted. Consequently,

16 Legado consented to a 92-day extension of time for the appeal hearing, to June 28, 2018.

17 155. In response to the appeals, Legado provided extensive additional information in

18 support of the findings of the Director and DAA, particularly with respect to community character

19 and views, water quality, land ownership, and community support for the Approved Project. DCP

20 staff also addressed the main objections of the appeals, point by point, in their Appeal

21 Recommendation Reports (the "Staff Reports') to the CPC.18

22 156. Regarding community character, Legado provided additional analysis of the

23 commonality of four-story buildings in the lower Playa Del Rey area, confirming the findings of the

24 Director. As shown in those materials-which included a map and photographs of every structure

25 referenced (see Exhibit "T* to this Petition)-lower Playa Del Rey contains 77 four-story structures,

26
18 DCP staff issued two Staff Reports, one each for the Director's determination and for the DAA 27 determination. Both Staff Reports were dated June 28, 2018 (the date of the appeal hearing, per City practice) and were issued to the public on or around June 18, 2018. 28

2 including many structures in the immediate vicinity of the Subject Property. As also noted in the

3 Director's findings and included in Exhibit "re. recent development on Esplanade Drive and around

4.o A the Del Rey Lagoon included structures reaching 45 feet in height, compared to 48 feet for the
Approved Project. These materials definitively established the complementary relationship of the
Approved Project to its surroundings, as well as the consistency of the height with existing
development.

7

8 157. Regarding alleged conflicts with the Coastal Interpretive Guidelines, as described in

9 detail above, the City considered the Coastal Interpretive Guidelines in its subsequent legislative

10 enactments and adopted some guidelines as zoning regulations. To the extent the Approved Project

11 complies with the zoning regulations and Community Plan, it necessarily complies with the Coastal
Interpretive Guidelines.

12

13 158. Further, the recent approvals at heights of up to 37 feet in the immediate vicinity of

14 the Subject Property, in addition to the 45-foot developments on Esplanade and around the Del Rey

15 Lagoon-all cited in the CDP determination letter-demonstrate the City's consistent interpretation

16 of the Community Plan as containing no specific height limit, let alone a height limit of 36 feet.

159.

17 Regarding water quality, opponents' objections remained rooted in a claimedand

18 factually incorrect-need for permanent dewatering, rather than the temporary, constructed-related

19 dewatering proposed. Legado provided additional analysis of the lack of potential for dewatering to

20 affect the groundwater contamination plume resulting from the Del Rey Cleaners site. This included

21 additional analysis provided by hydrologists and hydrogeologists that included extensive direct soil

22 sampling, as well as groundwater pumping tests and modelling under a range of scenarios to provide

conservative results.

24 Hearing and Consideration by the City Planning Commission

160.

25 The City Planning Commission ("CPC*) may reverse or modify the decision of the

26 Director if it finds either decision-maker erred. (LAMC §§12.20.2; 12.22-A.25(g)(2)(f); 16.05-H.4.)

27 A failure to act renders the Director's or DAA's decision final. (LAMC $§16.05-H, 17.06-A.3.)

161.

28 A public hearing occurred before five of the nine City Planning Commissioners on OI

42
First Amended Verified Petition

1 about June 28, 2018.

2 162. Prior to the hearing, Legado provided to the CPC and the Council Office more than

3 500 signatures from Playa del Rey residents in support of the Approved Project. This was reinforced

4 by the large number of Playa del Rey residents who appeared and spoke in support of the Approved
Project at the hearing.

163. A CPC majority comprises five votes, irrespective of the number of Commissioners
present; therefore, any decision on the subject appeals required five votes. The CPC denied the appeal

8 as to the Map with a 5-0 vote, but failed to reach consensus on the Density Bonus, Site Plan Review

9 (SPR), and Coastal Development Permit (CDP), voting 4-1 to deny the appeal and approve the

10 Project, which was one vote short thereby resulting in a no action by the CPC and loss of CPC

11 jurisdiction. Hence, the result was a de-facto denial a of the appeal. Consistent with the appeals, the

12 foci of the CPC deliberations were water quality, traffic, and an alleged conflict between the Project

13 and the Coastal Act with respect to aesthetic resources. The determination letters for the appeals were

14 issued on July 9, 2018, and revised determination letters with a technical correction were issued on

15 July 10, 2018. The Density Bonus and SPR approvals became final and not further appealable.

16 However, the CDP was appealable to the City Council.

17 K. Appeal to the Council

18 164. Opponents appealed the CDP, Map, and adoption of the MND to the Council, pursuant

19 to sections 12.20.2-H and 17.06-A of the LAMC and section 21151(c) of the Public Resources Code.

20 Pursuant to section 17.06-A.4 of the LAMC, the Council was required to hear the appeals within 30

21 days of the expiration of the appeal period, yielding a deadline of August 17, 2018.

22 165. During the pendency of the appeals but prior to the hearing by the Planning and Land

23 Use Management (CPLUM") Committee of the Council, Legado attempted to address the concerns

24 of Council District 11 regarding height and floor area-despite the significant reductions to both

25 under the Approved Project-and agreed to extend the time required for the Council to hear the

26 matter. Legado submitted the 60-day extension request to the City Clerk on or about August 3, 2018.

27 The extension provided the Council until October 16, 2018 to consider the Approved Project.

28

43
First Amended Verified Petition

1 166. Legado provided the extension for the express purpose of working with the Council

2 Office to address concerns regarding design, including possible solutions to reduce the height of the

3 structure. Legado and Legado's representatives attempted on multiple occasions to contact the

4 Council Office: the response was silence.
5 167. The PLUM Committee considered the Approved Project at a public hearing on August
6 14, 2018. As with the CPC, the primary foci of the hearing were aesthetics (character and views),
A water quality, and traffic and parking. The PLUM Committee, despite the personal testimony of

8 Councilmember Mike Bonin in opposition to Legado's now twice-approved proposal, and in explicit

9 recognition of the litigation risk to the City under applicable law, voted to forward the case to the full

10 City Council without a recommendation as to whether to grant or deny the appeals.
11 168. Merely three days later, on August 17, 2018, and with only 24 hours' notice, the City

12 Council considered the appeals during a "special" meeting. The City Council was not required to

13 hold a special meeting, as the time to act on the appeals did not expire for 60 more days, on or about

14 October 16, 2018. Rather, Legado is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, the purpose of

15 the "special" meeting was solely to deprive Legado and supporters adequate notice of the hearing.

16 169. On the date of the City Council appeal hearing, Councilmember Bonin provided to the

17 City Council two lengthy motions not previously disclosed or made available prior to the meeting or

18 to the time at which the appeals were considered. After the introducing the motions, Councilmember

19 Bonin was allowed to present and argue the appeals for approximately 15 minutes, despite the listing

20 of these motions on the consent calendar of the City Council agenda. (Exhibit "J".)

21 170. Legado is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, City Council actions on

22 land use approvals are considered on its consent calendar when forwarded from the PLUM Committee

23 with a recommendation for action. Here, no such recommendation existed.

24 171. Legado is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, the practice of the City

25 Council for consent calendar items is to remove items from the consent calendar and accept public

26 testimony when speaker cards are submitted for that item.

27 172. Although Legado's representatives submitted speaker cards for the purpose of
28

44
First Amended Verified Petition

1 addressing the City Council regarding the appeal of the CPC's actions, they were refused any
opportunity to do so. This refusal might have been justified had the City Council merely adopted the
recommendation of the PLUM Committee without any further proceedings on the matter; here,

w however, the City Council action required two motions presented for the first time at the City Council
hearing, with no opportunity for public redress, let alone any opportunity for the councilmembers
actually to read and understand the motions.

173. The Council refused any testimony from DCP staff, Legado, or the public, conducted

8 no deliberation, and proceeded immediately to a vote.

9 174. The Council motions regarding the appeals- -Items 25-A (Map) and 26-A (CDP)

10 purported to grant the appeals and reject the Approved Project on bases similar to those presented in

11 the appeals.

12 1. Council Motion on the CDP

13 175. Regarding the CDP, the grounds comprised alleged nonconformity with the Coastal

14 Act regarding the following topics: consideration of scenic resources, community character, coastal

15 access, sea level rise, prejudice to future adoption of an LCP, the Coastal Interpretive Guidelines,

16 consideration of prior Coastal Commission decisions, and alleged deficiencies of the MND under

17 CEQA.

18 176. Critically, the Council motion did make any required findings under the HAA. As

19 stated above, the HAA requires a finding that the preponderance of the evidence demonstrates an

20 unavoidable impact to public health or safety that cannot feasibly be mitigated without a reduction

21 in size or density. Yet all of the purported findings of the Council motion evaluate whether substantial

22 evidence supports a denial of the Approved Project. This alone renders the motion defective under

23 the HAA; however, as described below, substantial evidence does not support the Council motion in

24 any case.

25 177. The Council failed to proceed in a manner required by law because it failed to address

26 the decision from which the appeal was taken. Specifically, the motion regarding the CDP only

27 addressed the initial decision by the Director, and not the decision of the CPC, contrary to the

28

45
First Amended Verified Petition

requirements of LAMC section 12.20-H, which requires the City Council to address the decision from
which the appeal was takenhere, the CPC's action on July 28, 2018. Thus, nothing in the motion
could constitute substantial evidence as to error by the CPC.
178. Notwithstanding that defect, however, substantial evidence does not support--and in
fact contradicts-the City Council's purported findings even as to the Director's decision.

179. As a preliminary matter, the City Council office claims the Director erred by "fail[ing]
to examine the visual compatibility with the character of the surrounding areas." (CDP Motion, p.2.)

8 As described above, the Director devoted at least five pages of the determination for the CDP to
discussion of visual and scenic character and related issues. This discussion included a detailed

10 description of the height and intensity of surrounding development, the relationship of that

l1 development to zoning regulations, policy, published guidance, and two decades of land use permit

12 decisions from the Coastal Commission for development in the lower Playa Del Rey area. Thus, even

13 a cursory examination of the record demonstrates this threshold claim in the motion does not

14 withstand scrutiny and is totally unsupported.

15 180. In any event, substantial evidence does not support the City Council's finding that the

16 size and scale of the Approved Project conflicts with existing development. Evidence regarding

17 development intensity in the vicinity of the Subject Property included the Director's information

18 regarding the range of intensities and building heights in the vicinity, which includes buildings of

19 three to four stories (the Approved Project is four stories), as well as recent buildings of 45 feet in

20 height along the Del Rey Lagoon and on Esplanade.

21 181. The evidence considered by the CPC also included a map and listing of at least 77

22 buildings in the lower Playa Del Rey area that reach four stories-like the Approved Project-

23 including one residential structure across the street from the Subject Property. Further, the reduction

24 in height from the Modified Project to the Approved Project occurred precisely as a result of the

25 Director's determination that a 37-foot base height was appropriate in light of Coastal Commission

26 decisions over approximately the last 15 years, as well as the presence of 45-foot-tall buildings.
27 182. Further, the Director expressly considered the cases upon which the City Council

28

46
First Amended Verified Petition

motion relies. Within the planning context of lower Playa Del Rey, the Approved Project is unique,
as it comprises one of only two density bonus and/or affordable housing projects proposed in the
Playa Del Rey area in at least the last decade, and is the only one approved. And the Director expressly
determined that although the prior Coastal Commission approvals were different in type and extent
from the Approved Project (p. 27 of 42). Although the Council motion quotes testimony by DCP staff
regarding the prior approvals, it fails to address the crucial fact that the Approved Project was
modified and conditioned expressly to respect those approvals and incorporate their underlying

8 assumptions.

183. The City Council motion attempts to rely on Kalnel Gardens, supra, for the

10 a proposition that a density bonus does not supersede the Coastal Act, but fails to address the dual

11 requirements of SB1818 and the Coastal Act to harmonize coastal protection and the provision of

12 affordable housing, which the Coastal Act itself recognizes as a pressing social and economic need

13 State-wide. (Govt. Code §65589, 65915; PRC §§30005.1(a)-(b), 30007, 30604(f).)

14 184. The finding's claim regarding the "statistical[]" and "objective[]* basis for its

15 determination similarly fails. As described above, existing development in the surrounding area range

16 from 37 to 45 feet, while the Approved Project reaches a maximum of 48 feet, though substantial

17 portions of the Approved Project are as low as 15 feet, with substantial articulation of building

18 elements. The reductions in height from the Original Project and Modified Project to the Approved

19 Project were imposed specifically in response to "statistical[]" and "objective[]" data regarding

20 community character and decisions by the Coastal Commission over a period of about two decades,

21 as described above.

22 185. That the record included evidence the City Council could read differently than the

23 Director and/or CPC does not indicate error or abuse of discretion. In short, the City Council motion,

24 rather than evaluating the prior decision(s) for error or abuse of discretion, simply substituted its

25 judgment.

26 186. The finding that the Project would adversely affect scenic views, in violation of the

27 Coastal Act, is similarly unsupported. As noted on page 24 of the CDP determination letter, the

28

47
First Amended Verified Petition

1 Subject Property is not designated as a highly sensitive scenic area in the Califoria Coastline

2 Preservation and Recreation Plan. The City Council motion emphasizes the scenic designation of

( Vista Del Mar and Culver Boulevard, and pays lip service to the resources the scenic designations
were assigned to protect, but ignores the relationship of the Approved Project to those resources and
conflates views from different locations.
187. However, the evidence before the Director and CPC are clear. No views of the ocean
n are currently available through the Subject Property because it is surrounded by existing development

8 that blocks such views. Hence, the Approved Project does not cause or create a blockage of views of

9 the ocean.

10 188. Views through the Culver Boulevard right-of-way near the Project Site, at the

11 intersection with Pacific Avenue/Trolley Place, include limited views of dunes, but no views of the

12 ocean. The view across the Project Site from Vista Del Mar to the ocean is obstructed by existing

13 residential buildings west of Vista Del Mar, Trolley, and Trolley (some of which are up to four stories

14 tall), and existing commercial and residential buildings north of Culver Boulevard.

15 189. The City Council motion notes the testimony of DCP staff that some views of coastal

16 dunes would be obscured by development on the Subject Property. However, the motion erroneously

17 attributes that loss to the density bonus. To the extent limited views of the dunes are available across

18 the Subject Property from Vista Del Mar, they exist at grade level, and any development on the

19 Subject Property (including a single-story a development) would obscure any such views. Furtber,

20 views of the dunes would continue to exist through the Vista Del Mar right-of-way, approaching

21 Pacific Avenue/Trolley Place. Any loss of views would not occur as a result of the density bonus

22 approval.

23 190. Views of the ocean are available across the Subject Property only from Montreal

24 Street, which sits on the bluff 100 feet above the Subject Property, overlooking the whole of the lower

25 Playa Del Rey Area. Further, pages 24 to 27 of the MND and pages IV-1 to IV-6 of the supplemental

26 Initial Study determined the primary viewing area had become obscured by foliage, but that public

27 ocean views from roadways along the bluff would remain, as shown in the visual simulation provided

28

48
First Amended Verified Petition

1 in Figure IV-1 of the MND. Private views, from private properties, are not protected by the Coastal

2 Act.

191. Further, additional visual simulations were prepared as part of the responses to

comments, based on digital elevation and Modified Project data, and are attached as Exhibit "K." As
shown in the diagrams, these simulations represent with-Project views from the top of Montreal, as
well as from about mid-way up the slope. Further, those simulations assumed a 56-foot maximum

7 building height, and the maximum height approved by the Director is 48 feet, further reducing any

8 effect on ocean views. Although private views are not protected either by CEQA or by City ordinance

9 or policy, these simulations also demonstrate that the limited existing ocean views from these points

10 of view would not be substantially adversely affected. Views of the ocean would remain, consistent

11 with the simulation and determination in the MND.

12 192. Further, because the Approved Project would include improvements such as outdoor

13 seating areas along Culver Boulevard and Trolley Place, It would increase opportunities for views

14 along sidewalks associated with these roadways.

15 193. For all of those reasons, substantial evidence in the record supports the Director's and

16 CPC's determination regarding scenic views. That the City Council motion used selective information

17 to reach a different conclusion does not indicate an error by the Director or by the CPC.

18 194. Regarding protection of scenic and visual qualities of coastal areas, the City Council

19 motion relies on factors that are simply contrary to law, and merely ignores the analysis and findings

20 of the Director, substituting those of the City Council instead.

21 195. Although the City Council motion claims Project effects on views of the coastal bluffs

22 from the coast constitute a violation of the Coastal Act, the law does not protect those views, as stated

23 above. Schneider v. Calif. Coastal Comm'n., 140 Cal. App. 4th 1339, 1344 (2006). Nevertheless,

24 visual simulations provided of the Approved Project, looking toward the bluffs, demonstrated the

25 continued existence of views of the bluff tops post-development. The City Council motion offers no

26 countervailing evidence to the contrary, leaving its assertion unsupported by any evidence, let alone

27 substantial evidence.

28

49
First Amended Verified Petition

scenic resources 1 196. Regarding the claimed failure of the Approved Project to preserve

2 along the ocean, looking seaward, the City Council motion again relies upon the same erroneous

c assertions described above, including the scenic highway designations for Vista Del Mar and Culver
Boulevard. As described above and in the record, the City Council motion disregards the views that
currently exist, those that would remain under any development scenario, and in the case of Culver
Boulevard, the inability of development on the Subject Property to affect views from Culver
Boulevard, as the resources for which that roadway is designated are located away from the Subject

8 Property.

9 197. Worse still, the motion mischaracterizes the effects on certain views, particularly the

10 views of the Santa Monica Mountains. As demonstrated in Exhibit "K' the visual simulations

11 a depicting a 56-foot-tall structure demonstrate the availability of ocean views over the proposed

12 building, including the horizon. As views of the Santa Monica Mountains lie either above the horizon

13 or comprise the horizon, which remain available, the reduction in height associated with the Approved

14 Project-at 48 feet tall-would only further ensure that such views remain.

15 198. Lastly, the City Council motion references only the 37-foot height limits permitted,

16 and willfully and erroneously omits the 45-foot heights of buildings along Esplanade (which are

17 located in the same view shed from the coastal bluffs). Thus the motion's description of the setting
of the Subject Property is incomplete and misleading, resulting in a failure to support the 18

19 corresponding finding.

20 199. The City Council motions assert, without any substantial evidence, that the parking

21 included in the Approved Project is insufficient and denies coastal access. Here again, the only

22 "evidence" presented is the suggested parking rates provided in the Coastal Interpretive Guidelines.

23 As described above in detail, the Coastal Interpretive Guidelines do not constitute binding regulations,

24 and the City has, over the 40 years since their promulgation, determined which guidelines to codify.

25 Legado is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, the guidelines ultimately adopted by the

26 City do not include the suggested parking ratios in the Coastal Interpretive Guidelines.

27 200. Although the findings cite a "zip code study,' provided by project opponents, that

28

50
First Amended Verified Petition

1 purports

2 to demonstrate the range of locations from which visitors to Playa Del Rey travel, that study

3 is totally unsourced, and project opponents provide nO basis for determining the accuracy of the
"study," nor do the project opponents provide any basis for determining their expertise or

Un qualifications for doing so. Absent any information that would allow some way to evaluate the

6 accuracy of the results of the study, it cannot comprise substantial information to support any finding.

7 201. Further, although the finding regarding parking implies the need to replace parking

8 lost through other developments, the Approved Project itself would not result in the loss of parking

9 spaces: no parking is currently required on-site, as the Subject Property is long vacant, and the
proposed structure would not displace street parking.

10 202.

11 The finding references "applicable standards"; however, in the case of the Approved

12 Project, the applicable standard for the proposed residential component iS Parking Option 1 of the

13 Density Bonus Ordinance. Parking for the proposed commercial uses remains fully parked according

14 to the applicable standards set forth for commercial uses in section 12.21-A.4(c) of the LAMC. The

15 finding simply provides no basis for concluding otherwise. Rather, it relies almost solely on an

16 unsupported statement regarding the alleged adequacy of the parking provided, and provides no basis

17 for a finding of conflict with the coastal access provisions of the Coastal Act.

203.

18 The City Council motion also cites section 30253 of the Coastal Act for the proposition

19 that the lack of a sea-level rise study and geological study for the Subject Property prevents the ability

to

20 make unspecified findings under the Coastal Act. The finding accurately characterizes the location

21 of the Subject Property as one and one half blocks from the beach, but omits the fact that existing

22 development consisting both of residential and commercial uses separates the Subject Property from

23 the beach, as well. The basis for the finding that development on the Subject Property requires a sea-

24 level rise study is an inapt comparison with another project located on Ocean Front Walk (also known
as the Venice Boardwalk).

25 204.

26 Unlike the Subject Property, the 305-309 Ocean Front Walk property directly fronts

27 the beach and would be much more directly subject to sea-level rise than a property located over a

28 block from the beach. Furthermore, as with the parking study, the purported sea level rise study

51
First Amended Verified Petition

submitted by project opponents, though asserted by the motion to have been prepared according to

2 Coastal Commission standards, remains without adequate foundation. That IS, the project opponents

3 do not have any professional or vocational qualification for preparing such a study, and cannot qualify

4 as experts for such a purpose. The finding itself contains no basis for evaluation of the accuracy or
conclusions of the report, and it therefore cannot constitute substantial evidence for such a finding.
205. Even if the purported report reached the conclusion that the Subject Property could be
subject to future sea-level rise, the finding provides no basis for any determination regarding

8 compliance with the Coastal Act, as any development on the Subject Property would be subject to

9 identical future conditions. Further, the Approved Project would not be subject to any conditions not

10 shared by surrounding development. Simply put, this finding remains unsupported and unsupportable,

11 and articulates no failure regarding potential risks to life and property.

12 206. The statement in the motion that the geological conditions of the Subject Property

13 cannot fully be evaluated is simply false. Among the technical reports listed in connection with the

14 environmental clearance (see Director's Appeal Report on the CDP, Table of Contents) are an

15 approved geotechnical report dated December 1, 2009. Further, Condition 21 of the CDP requires

16 preparation and submittal of a final geotechnical report prior to issuance of grading permits.

17 207. The finding regarding prejudice to future adoption of an LCP simply lacks any

18 common sense, setting aside the lack of evidence to support it. Testimony from the public regarding

19 the allegedly precedent-setting action of the Approved Project is not evidence of any obligation by

20 the City to approve any other proposed development. Any further development in lower Playa Del

21 Reyor even on the Subject Property itself-would require a CDP from the City, the Coastal

22 Commission, or both. The CDP would, as with the Project, require a particularized determination

23 regarding the specific development proposal, the project site, and the relationship of both to

24 surrounding properties, developments, and natural and man-made features. Simply put, any CDP

25 issued for any other property does not obligate the City or Coastal Commission to issue any other

26 permit.

27 208. Further, adoption of an LCP is a legislative action that establishes a mix of policy and

28

52
First Amended Verified Petition

1 regulation, similar to a General Plan or a specific plan. The finding provides no basis for any

2 conclusion that approval of a single mixed-use development project could possibly preclude the City
or Coastal Commission adopting a major land use plan, and such a conclusion violates all common

4 sense. Even accepting, arguendo, the Approved Project would induce further, similar development
that adversely alters the character of lower Playa Del Rey, adoption of an LCP with more restrictive
6 land use regulations than currently exist would prevent further development similar to the Approved

7 Project. This finding simply IS not possible on the basis stated.

8 209. The City Council motion then provides additional discussion regarding the Coastal

9 Interpretive Guidelines and alleges the Director's failure to consider and implement the same. In

10 effect, the City Council motion treats the Coastal Interpretive Guidelines as mandatory, contrary to

11 the admissions of the Coastal Commission and binding case law.

12 210. The finding also disregards the City's consideration and incorporation of the Coastal

13 Interpretive Guidelines into its regulations and policy documents, as described in detail above.

14 Further, the finding contains an admission that the City has not implemented, for example, the height

15 limitations of the Coastal Interpretive Guidelines, but has "augmented" them through the Lagoon

16 Plan, another document never adopted by the City and not binding in any fashion.

17 211. Worse, the purported finding that the height of the Approved Project conflicts with the

18 Community Plan is contrary to State law. As discussed above, not only does SB1818 expressly

19 provide for concessions and incentives that conflict with local zoning and General Plan land use

20 regulations, but SB1818 and the LAMC both expressly prohibit such a finding on the basis of the

21 provision of those incentives.

22 212. Further, and as explained above, the Director's determination on the CDP expressly

23 considered the Approved Project within the context of the height limits established through prior

24 Coastal Commission approvals since 1998all of which, as admitted by the City Council motion,

25 exceeded the height limits suggested in the Coastal Interpretive Guidelines. Thus, this finding

26 remains unsupported.

27 213. To the extent development of a residential project on a commercial lot is inconsistent

28

53
First Amended Verified Petition

with the Coastal Interpretive Guidelines, it complies with the zoning regulations established by the

2 City subsequent to promulgation of the Coastal Interpretive Guidelines and the approval "in concept"
of the Lagoon Plan. As described above, the specific regulations applied to the Subject Property and
its immediate surroundings as "Q" conditions did not include any prohibition against development of
residential projects on commercial properties.
214. However, the City mischaracterizes the Coastal Interpretive Guidelines even on this
point. Even though the guidelines discourage residential development on commercial properties, the

8 City adopted a "Q" condition that prohibits residences on the ground floor of commercial properties,

9 as described above. Consistent with this requirement, the Approved Project contains commercial uses

10 and parking on the ground floor; the residences are proposed on the upper floors, consistent with the

l1 Coastal Interpretive Guidelines. Thus, the evidence in the record not only fails to support this finding,

12 but contradicts it.

13 215. With respect to parking, no action by the City establishes the parking ratios suggested

14 in the Coastal Interpretive Guidelines as requirements for development. In fact, the opposite is true:

15 as stated above, the LAMC establishes parking ratios for development projects at section 12.21, and

16 establishes reduced parking for residential units in affordable housing developments at section 12.22-

17 A.25. The Approved Project complies with both, by parking the commercial uses at "standard* rates,

18 and the residential units according to the reduced rates in Parking Option 1 of the Density Bonus

19 Ordinance. As the Director specifically considered the Approved Project within the prism of the

20 Coastal Interpretive Guidelines, as incorporated by subsequent City enactments, the record

21 contradicts this finding, as well.

22 216. The City Council motion wrongly states the Director failed adequately to consider

23 prior decisions of the Coastal Commission when evaluating the Approved Project. As described in

24 detail in the Director's determination and above, the Director specifically considered the 17 projects

25 for which records existed, and applied the density bonus to the Project on the basis of the height limits

26 collectively established by those decisions.

27 217. The motion attempts to discount the need for a density bonus by mischaracterizing

28

54
First Amended Verified Petition

the affordable housing of the Approved Project, in contravention of the Coastal Act, the Housing
Accountability Act, SB1818, and the Density Bonus Ordinance. The motion seeks to shirk the City's
cn responsibility under all applicable housing laws to provide for the needs of low-income households.
Even though, as the motion states, the Approved Project does not provide 20 percent of its units to
lower-income households, the motion erroneously and cynically implies the need to provide units for
moderate-income households, contrary to section 65589.5(h)(3) of the Government Code. As stated
7 in the Director's determination, the Approved Project would provide 12.5 percent of its units to very

8 low income households, and the command of the Coastal Act to provide housing opportunities for

9 lower-income households is clear, irrespective of percentage. (§30604(g).)

10 218. Further, the Coastal Act does not require that a project request a greater density than

11 permitted under applicable zoning to obtain protection. Rather, the Coastal Act prohibits reductions

12 from the density requested by an applicant, as long as that density is within the range permitted by

13 zoning, plus any density bonus. (§30604(f).)

14 219. Therefore, under applicable law, the fact that the Approved Project did not request

15 additional density is irrelevant. State law forbids requiring an economic study to demonstrate or

16 justify the need for the incentive, and permits denial of an incentive only where that incentive would

17 not result in "identifiable and actual cost reductions to provide for affordable housing costs,"

18 which include offsetting the reduced rents of affordable units. (Govt. Code §65915(d)(1)(A).) Here,

19 no evidence supports such a finding. First, as described above, the additional height and floor area

20 are required to provide market-rate units that will offset the costs associated with construction and

21 leasing of the proposed Very Low Income affordable units. The need for offsets of the costs

22 associated with providing affordable units here is particularly high, as the Project does not provide

23 the maximum number of units permitted by the LAMC on the Project Site, and therefore cannot

24 distribute construction and other costs among both base and density bonus units.

25 220. Thus, the characterization of the Approved Project as a luxury housing project, and

26 not an affordable housing project, is contrary to State law and the LAMC. Consistent with SB1818,

27 the LAMC defines "Housing Development Project« as any development of five or more units,

28
55
First Amended Verified Petition

1 including mixed-use projects that provide half or more of their floor area for residential units. ($12.22-

2 A.25(b).) This definition includes the Approved Project.
3 221. The motion attempts to discount the need for affordable housing by pointing to
existing, rent-stabilized units in Playa Del Rey, but testimony by Councilmember Bonin failed to
establish or even address the need for very low income affordable units. Moreover, to the extent
Councilmember Bonin asserted the Project would result in displacement of rent-stabilized units, that
7 assertion amounts to nothing more than speculation and cannot constitute substantial evidence,

8 particularly where, as here, the Approved Project would develop a long-vacant lot and would not

9 displace any housing units.

10 222. The motion's reliance on Kalnel Gardens, supra, is misplaced. As described above,

11 the Coastal Act itself prioritizes affordable housing and subordinates itself to the requirement to

12 provide it within the Coastal Zone.

13 1. City Council Motion on the Map and Vacation

14 223. Regarding the Map, the grounds which comprised the alleged non-conformance of the

15 Approved Project consisted of the following: non-conformance with applicable General and Specific

16 Plans, unsuitability of the Property for development of the Approved Project, environmental damage

17 and injury to fish and wildlife, serious public health problems, necessity of rights-of-way proposed

18 for vacation for present or prospective public purposes, and adequacy of the MND under CEQA. As

19 discussed below, the City Council findings to reject the Map fare no better than those adopted for the

20 City Council Motion on the CDP.

21 224. As with the motion for the CDP, the City Council Motion on the Map did make any

22 required •findings under the HAA. All of the purported findings of the Council motion evaluate

23 whether substantial evidence supports a denial of the Approved Project, rather than whether the

24 preponderance of the evidence compels a denial or density reduction on the basis of an unavoidable

25 impact to public health and safety. This alone renders the motion defective under the HAA; however,

26 as described below, substantial evidence does not support the City Council Motion on the Map in any

27 case.

28

56
First Amended Verified Petition

- 225. First, the Motion on the Map asserts the Approved Project does not conform to the

2 General Plan or applicable specific plan. The purported inconsistency focuses on a discussion of
c "design considerations" in the Community Plan that, according to the motion, limits height within the

+ 1n0 N Community Plan area to maximum of 36 feet. The motion is wrong.

226. Contrary to the motion, the discussion cited involves an assessment of needs, and does
not purport to regulate height. (See Community Plan, §5.C.) As stated therein, "Specific needs of the
area include: [1 Limit building height to a maximum of 36 feet." The provision does not purport

8 actually to limit height. Further, it provides a list of additional suggestions, some which were

9 incorporated into "Qu conditions, such as a prohibition on ground-floor residential uses on

10 commercial lots.

11 227. Moreover, the pattern and practice of the City's interpretation of the Community Plan
12 demonstrates the lack of a regulatory height limit other than zoning. As described above, the

13 Determination letter and the City Council motion on the CDP acknowledge commercial and

14 residential development in the lower Playa Del Rey area since 1998 has ranged from 37 to 45 feet. If

15 the Community Plan were intended to limit height to 36 feet, the 17 approvals over two prior decades

16 would have reflected that fact. Further, even to the extent some of that development predated current

17 version of the Community Plan, the development that occurred in and after 2004 included 37-foot

18 structures. Lastly, as also described above, the Community Plan conformance rezoning in 2004

19 included express limitations on building envelope and use beyond those established by the underlying

20 zone, in the form of "Q" conditions: none of those conditions purported to limit height or stories on

21 the Subject Property, but did limit height on other properties, demonstrating a specific intent to

22 condition development in certain subareas and not others. Thus, the available evidence in the record

23 directly refutes, and does not support, the purported finding of the City Council regarding

24 development limitations in the Community Plan.

25 228. To the extent the City Council motion on the Map implies a conflict with the

26 Community Plan on the basis of density bonus height, that implication is illegal under SB1818, as

27 described above. Similarly, the reference to a prior West Los Angeles Area Planning Commission

28
57
First Amended Verified Petition

1 ("APC) discussion regarding the height of another project, that discussion is simply irrelevant, as

2 that project did not include density bonus, and SB1818 precludes a finding of conflict with any

3 planning document based on the grant of a concession or incentive.

4 229. The same problem arises with the claim of a conflict regarding parking ratios. As

5 described above, both SB1818 and the Density Bonus Ordinance provide for reduced parking ratios

6 in addition to the density bonus itself and any other concessions or incentives. As with any other

7 concession or incentive, and as described above, a finding of inconsistency with the Community Plan

8 on the basis of the reduced parking ratio associated with the density bonus is simply erroneous and
cannot legally comprise a finding to deny the Approved Project.

10 230. The City Council Motion on the Map also references the purported sea level rise study,

11 which this petition previously addressed. As stated above, the "study" has no foundation, and the

12 project opponents who prepared it can demonstrate no qualifications or expertise for preparing such

13 a study. Consequently, it cannot provide a substantial evidentiary basis for any particular finding.

14 231. The City Council Motion also purports to overturn the Approved Project on the basis

15 of impacts to fish and wildlife and habitat. However, the finding is based on two falsehoods.

16 232. First, the motion wrongly claims no information exists regarding post-construction

17 dewatering and its impacts on the Ballona Wetlands. First, as described in detail above, no operational

18 dewatering is proposed. Dewatering would occur only during construction, and methods exist for

19 hydrologically isolating the Subject Property from its surroundings to eliminate any potential for

20 alteration of groundwater flow.

21 233. Secondly, as described in detail above, no hydrological connection exists between the

22 Subject Property and the Ballona Wetlands. To the extent storm water flows may enter Ballona Creek,

23 the Approved Project (or any development) is required to retain and treat those flows in accordance

24 with the Standard Urban Storm water Management Plan and other applicable water quality

25 regulations. The motion simply provides no factual basis for a contrary finding, leaving it totally

26 unsupported.

27 234. Regarding health risks, the City Council motion purports to rely on vapor intrusion
28

58
First Amended Verified Petition

1 risk at the Subject Property as a basis for denial of the Approved Project. Here again, however, all of

2 the substantial evidence in the record supports the opposite conclusion. As described in detail above,

3 the responses to comments on the MND included groundwater and soil vapor testing for chemicals

4 associated with the Del Rey Cleaners historic operation and groundwater contamination plume. These

5 tests were performed specifically to determine whether the plume had spread, and whether a risk of

6 vapor intrusion exists. As provided in the technical reports in the record for the MND, the results of

7 this direct testing were negative. Any speculation to the contrary is just that-speculation-and has

8 no evidentiary basis.

9 235. Further, the vapor intrusion is an existing condition of the environment, not a result of

10 the Approved Project or of any other development on the Subject Property. The law is clear that

11 CEQA does not concern itself with impacts of the environment on a project. See California Building

12 Industry Association v. Bay Area Air Quality Management District, 62 Cal. 4th 369 (2015). Thus,

13 this issue also could not constitute a basis for overturning adoption of the MND for the Approved

14 Project.

15 236. Even if groundwater contamination and vapor intrusion remained risks, substantial

16 evidence in the record demonstrates those risks-where they actually existcould be mitigated to

17 less-than-significant levels through implementation of measures that constitute accepted professional

18 practice, as described further below. Thus, no evidence in the record or cited by the motion could

19 support a finding that any such risk is significant and unavoidable and requires either a reduction in

20 density or denial of the Approved Project, and all applicable evidence in the record demonstrates the

21 feasibility of mitigating this impact, rather than rejecting the Approved Project in its entirety.

22 237. Lastly, the City Council motion on the Map mischaracterizes the vacation request and

23 provides a weak and erroneous justification for overturning the approval. This finding purports to

24 appeal to Mobility 2035 and implies the vacation request would result in public rights-of-way that are

25 somehow deficient. However, as stated in the department reports on the Map from the Bureau of

26 Engineering and from DOT, Culver Boulevard is current over-dedicated, and even after the requested

27 vacation, the cross-section of the right-of-way would remain consistent with the parameters

28

59
First Amended Verified Petition

established in Mobility 2035. To the extent street parking exists on Culver Boulevard, that street

2 parking would remain with implementation of the Project and would not be reduced.

3 238. The finding also speculates that some future use of the right-of-way for Culver
Boulevard and for Vista Del Mar Place could occur. However, as stated in the title records provided

5 to the CPC and to the City Council, Vista Del Mar Place and alley-was established specifically to

6 provide access to the commercial parcels that comprise the Subject Property. Absent the Approved

7 Project and the associated lot merger, that right-of-way would be required to continue to provide

8 access. Among other things, the "Q" conditions for the Subject Property include the requirement to

9 avoid vehicle entrances and exits on Culver Boulevard, and instead to provide them on secondary

10 streets. With the Approved Project, access to the Subject Property as a whole would occur from

11 Pacific Avenue/Trolley Way, in accordance with the "Q" conditions. However, in the absence of the

12 Approved Project, the zoning regulations require access to the individual parcels comprising the

13 Subject Property from Vista Del Mar Place.

14 239. The finding also speculates a future public purpose for Vista Del Mar Place as parking.

15 But as described above, this is contrary to the law. State law and the LAMC preclude parking in

16 public alleys. Again, as described above, the alley must continue to exist, in the absence of the

17 Approved Project, to provide lawful access to any business fronting Culver Boulevard, as required

18 by the "Q°e conditions established for the Subject Property. Any contrary does violence to the

19 applicable law and facts, and is therefore erroneous.

20 2. Findings Regarding the California Environmental Quality Act.

21 240. Substantial evidence must support a fair argument that a significant, unavoidable

22 impact could result from the Approved Project. The Califoria Environmental Quality Act defines

23 substantial evidence as "fact, a reasonable assumption predicated upon fact, or expert opinion

24 supported by fact." Public Resources Code Section 21080(e)(1). The law is clear that "argument,

25 speculation, unsubstantiated opinion or narrative" do not constitute substantial evidence. (Id. at subd.

26 (e)(2); CEQA Guidelines §15384; see also, Newberrry Springs Water Assn. v. County of San

27 Bernardino, 150 Cal. App. 3d 740 (1984).) Further, courts have well established that testimony, even

28

60
First Amended Verified Petition

by an expert, is not necessarily substantial. Cathay Mortuary, Inc. V. San Francisco Planning
Comm'n, 207 Cal. App. 3d 275 (1989). This is particularly true where, as here, the argument that a

3 significant impact could occur is supported by testimony that fails to account for key relevant factors,
or contains nothing more than suppositions and assertions, not supported by facts, that certain things

5 would occur. See, e.g., Apt. Assn. of Greater Los Angeles v. City of Los Angeles, 90 Cal. App. 4th

6 1162, 1175-76 (2001).

7 241. Here, the purported evidence upon which the Council motion relies amounts to nothing

8 more than suppositions and assertions. Testimony regarding, for example, purportedly protected

9 views seeks to apply a planning and policy document that does not include the Project Site or the

10 Project, and points to other documents that evaluated different visual resources in different contexts.

11 Moreover, perfect consistency with each policy or objective is not required for a finding of

12 a consistency with a planning document as a whole. For all of these reasons, a and as described further

13 below, the opponents' arguments upon which the City Council motion relies failed to support their

14 assertions with substantial evidence, and therefore failed to raise a fair argument within the meaning

15 of CEQA.

16 242. The City Council motion purports to find a fair argument with respect to several

17 classes of impacts. However, the arguments presented are not supported by substantial evidence.

18 243. In contrast, substantial evidence-including technical reports from hydrology and

19 environmental firms HydroQuip, TerraCosta, Citadel Environmental, which incorporate direct testing

20 under the supervision of the RWQCBsupports the Director's determination that the Approved

21 Project would not result in significant impacts.

22 244. The CEQA Guidelines define substantial evidence as "enough relevant information

23 and reasonable inferences from this information that a fair argument can be made to support a

24 conclusion, even though other conclusions might also be reached." Guidelines Section 15384(a).

25 Substantial evidence includes "facts, reasonable assumptions predicated upon facts, and expert

26 opinion supported by facts" (Id. subd. (b)), but not "[a]rgument, speculation, unsubstantiated opinion

27 or narrative, evidence which is clearly erroneous or inaccurate, or evidence of social or economic

28

61
First Amended Verified Petition

1 impacts which do not contribute to or are not caused by physical impacts on the environment.' (Id.

2 subd. (a).)
4 245. The City Council motion purports to find that a fair argument of a significant impact
exists with respect to potential effects of the Del Rey Cleaners groundwater plume, claiming "credible
u expert testimony [exists] on both sides" of the issues raised, and claiming the MND deferred
mitigation. (Motion 26-A, p. 10.) These claims substantially mischaracterize the record.

246. a As a preliminary matter, substantial evidence does not exist on both sides. Project

8 opponents retained the services of HydroFocus to dispute the findings of the MND and the supporting

9 technical reports. However, even if Hydrofocus is considered an expert for the purposes this

10 discussion, the primary points of evidence upon which it relies are (1) permanent dewatering; (2) an

11 unsupported pumping rate for dewatering; (3) the absence of any hydrological influence of the Pacific

12 Ocean; and (4) a hydrologic connection between the Subject Property and the Ballona Wetlands. Each

13 of these assumptions is erroneous and contradicted by the available evidence in the record.

14 247. Moreover, even in the event that construction-related dewatering may have any

15 potential to influence groundwater in the vicinity of the Del Rey Cleaners plume, a range of measures

16 are available to ensure that dewatering associated with the development is hydraulically isolated from

. 17 the Subject Property's surroundings.

18 248. Master Response 1 to comments on the MND summarized the results of a series of

19 detailed groundwater studies conducted on the Subject Property: these studies included direct

20 sampling of groundwater; direct groundwater pumping to simulate dewatering activity; and

21 examination of hydrogeological conditions on the Subject Property and vicinity.

22 249. Even the detailed studies provided in response to comments evaluated dewatering

23 associated with the Modified Project, which included two subterranean parking levels. The Approved

24 Project included only one subterranean parking level, which would substantially reduce the volume

25 and intensity of dewatering during construction and further reduce the less-than-significant impacts

26 anticipated to occur in any case.

27 250. HydroFocus' assumption that the Project would undertake permanent dewatering is

28

62
First Amended Verified Petition

simply wrong. Master Response clarified that the Approved Project contemplated only construction

2 dewatering, and that permanent dewatering would be avoided through foundation design, consistent

3 with recent development of structures in Playa Vista.

251. To further address the effects of that dewatering, numerous groundwater samples were
collected from various depths at 200 Culver Boulevard (which lies between the Subject Property and
the former Del Rey Cleaners site) to evaluate current groundwater conditions, including the presence
of volatile organic compounds ("VOCs'), as well as soils and geochemistry. Soil samples were

8 obtained at five-foot intervals to a depth of 50 feet below ground surface (*bgs'). Based on this

9 testing, no VOCs were reported by the laboratory above the method detection limit for soil.

10 252. The studies also examined whether VOC-impacted groundwater associated with the

11 former Del Rey Cleaners site could be affected by dewatering activities. A dewatering test was

12 performed to determine the appropriate dewatering technique and rate, and the test included

13 monitoring groundwater quality at the Subject Property. Groundwater occurred at about 8 feet bgs,

14 and field observations showed minimal water quality fluctuations during the monitoring period. The

15 fluctuations appeared to result from general variatións in field water quality sampling.

16 253. The dewatering tests yielded an anticipated discharge volume of approximately 4,000

17 gallons per minute ("gpm"), with a and a radial influence of no more than 125-150 feet around the

18 exterior of the Subject Property. The hydrogeologist opined that a reduced dewatering volume would

19 provide an additional safety factor, and the Approved Project eliminates one level of subterranean

20 parking, providing for a dewatering reduction of nearly half.

21 254. The hydrogeologist also recommended a barrier system to limit any remaining

22 potential gradient changes or exposure to contaminated groundwater. Potential barrier systems could

23 comprise a subsurface vertical barrier, such as an in-situ mixed soil/cement/bentonite slurry wall or

24 similar engineered system around the Subject Property. Dewatering activities would then take place

25 within the barrier to minimize any remaining potential for groundwater migration. The report

26 recommended any of the following potential techniques, all of which are commonly employed: 1)

27 soil-cement-bentonite slurry wall; 2) secant pile wall; 3) diaphragm concrete wall; or 4)

28

63
First Amended Verified Petition

1 cofferdams/sheet pile wall. Any barrier option would isolate the Subject Property and limit the
hydraulic influence of the dewatering to within the boundaries of the barrier system, and it would not
cn change the natural groundwater conditions or flow.

255. In a addition to a subsurface vertical barrier around the Subject Property, a permeable
reactive barrier-that is, a series of wells injecting treatment reagents-could be installed to

6 approximately 40 feet bgs across the 200 Culver Boulevard property to treat contaminants migrating

7 in the groundwater, if needed as additional assurance against construction-related effects on

8 groundwater flows (as stated above, construction of the Modified or Approved Project would not

9 influence groundwater at the former Del Rey Cleaners site). As stated in Master Response 1, this

10 treatment method is a commonly used and effective system for migrating harmful VOCs in

11 groundwater. As groundwater flows through the barrier, the VOCs are effectively treated

12 underground.

13 256. Thus, to the extent groundwater contamination remains a risk, substantial evidence in

14 the record demonstrates those risks-where they actually exist-could be mitigated to less-than-

15 significant levels through implementation of measures that constitute accepted professional practice.

16 Thus, no evidence in the record or cited by the motion could support a finding that any such risk is

17 significant and unavoidable and requires either a reduction in density or denial of the Approved

18 Project, as required by the HAA

19 257. In comparison to the detailed and extensive testing conducted in support of the MND,

20 and the site-specific results provided by the testing, opponents and their consultant offer nothing other

21 than uninformed guesses that are at odds with the actual data available from the Subject Property.

22 These uninformed guesses do not constitute substantial evidence, and fail to support a fair argument

23 that a significant, unavoidable impact would occur.

24 258. The technical reports prepared to analyze dewatering also specifically evaluated the

25 potential for dewatering to affect groundwater underlying the Ballona Wetlands. Contrary to the

26 Council motion, the technical reports prepared in support of the responses to comments on the MND

27 specifically evaluated long-term groundwater effects, assuming the Modified Project would exert a

28

64
First Amended Verified Petition

1 permanent influence on groundwater despite the commonality of designs that would avoid such an

2 effect.

c 259. As stated in the investigation, two conditions could induce changes in groundwater
conditions: 1) transient conditions; and 2) steady-state conditions. While construction dewatering is
temporary, and therefore by definition represents a transient condition, in order to assess the worst-
case scenario, the analysis assumed a permanent, steady-state condition.

260. The effect of development on the Subject Property necessarily depends on whether a

8 direct hydrologic connection exists. Based on a bydrogeological model that reflects the geologic cross

9 section of the vicinity, the analysis determined the groundwater conditions within the wetlands and

10 the Ballona and Silverado aquifers are not significantly interconnected, and as such, the wetlands are,

11 1n effect, a separate system.

12 261. The analysis in the MND, unlike opponents' HydroFocus report, also identified

13 recharge sources, groundwater sinks, and the location of impermeable boundaries, which are crucial

14 to determining the relationship, if any, between the Subject Property and the Ballona Wetlands.

15 Several groundwater recharge sources for the Ballona Wetlands exist including the Ballona Creek,

16 and the Pacific Ocean (a dominant recharge source omitted from HydroFocus' discussion), and the

17 Ballona Wetlands themselves. In addition, another source of recharge of potential importance are the

18 underlying Ballona and Silverado aquifers.

19 262. Notwithstanding the above, a portion of the analysis still assumed some connection

20 between the Subject Property and the Ballona Wetlands to provide the most conservative possible

21 analysis. The evaluation of this model showed that the drawdown within the wetlands would be

22 negligible, given that the wetlands are located beyond the radius of influence of dewatering for the

23 proposed excavation (note that this area of influence would be further reduced with implementation

24 of a barrier system during dewatering. Moreover, even if the radius of influence was greater, any

25 drawdown of the groundwater table would be mitigated by recharge from sources within the radius

26 of influence of the wetlands.

27 263. Based on this analysis that, unlike the Hydrofocus report, reflected the

28
65
First Amended Verified Petition

hydrogeological cross section of the Subject Property and Ballona Wetlands vicinity, the

2 supplemental analysis to the MND concluded that for drawdown to occur at the wetlands, the

3 wetlands need to be located within the radius of influence of the dewatering efforts. Estimates for

4 soils comprising the near-surface portions of the upper division of the recent Holocene deposits
5 indicate that the wetlands are located beyond the effective radius of influence for dewatering for the
Project. As such, the drawdown within the wetlands due to the lowering of the groundwater level in

the upper division of the most recent Holocene deposits as a result of the construction dewatering of

8 the proposed excavation is negligible.

9 264. Finally, given that the soil characteristics of the area yield an estimated radius of

10 influence of a point within the wetlands of only 50 to 100 feet, changes in the groundwater table

11 outside of the wetlands only conceptually impact a limited and short distance into the wetland. Thus,

12 for points located 100 feet and greater from the edge of the wetland, changes in the groundwater table

13 at the boundary of the wetlands have no impact on the groundwater levels within the wetlands.

14 265. Substantial evidence does not support the City Council's purported finding that the

15 Project would have adverse effects on water quality. This flaw is shared with the related claim of an

16 insufficient ability to mitigate such effects, despite the detailed description of numerous accepted

17 methods for doing so in the responses to comments on the MND and the lack of any countervailing

18 substantial evidence in the record. Aside from the lack of specificity of this finding, substantial

19 evidence in the record contradicts this finding, as well. The MND for the Project concluded that

20 potentially significant impacts would not occur with respect to aesthetics, water quality, and

21 transportation and traffic. In each case, the MND determined either that no significant impact would

22 occur in the first instance, or that incorporation of mitigation measures would ensure that impacts are

23 mitigated to a less-than-significant level. The appeals and public comment focused particularly on

24 aesthetics, water quality, and traffic and parking, making inaccurate claims as to both.

25 266. Contrary to the City Council motion, these analyses also hold for water quality: if no

26 direct hydrological connection exists, no significant effect on water quality within the Ballona

27 Wetlands could occur. Here again, this is not merely a disagreement among experts: the experts who

28

66
First Amended Verified Petition

prepared the analyses in support of the MND actually accounted for hydrological and soil conditions

2 in the Subject Property and wetland vicinity, and relied upon pumping and other data actually
collected at the Subject Property and adjacent to the Del Rey Cleaners site. In contrast, opponents
relied upon supposition and simply failed to account for the hydrologic and soil factors that actually

5 exist.

267. Where, as here, actual conditions underlying the area are known, the failure to account
for those conditions deprives opponents' arguments of any substantial evidentiary value. Further,

8 opponents fail even to attempt to address the hydrologic isolation measures proposed for the Subject

9 Property, and no dispute exists regarding their effectiveness either during or after construction. For

10 these reasons, the "evidence" cited by opponents a cannot support a fair argument that a significant,

11 unavoidable impact would occur.

12 268. Similarly, to the extent the City Council motion claims a disagreement among experts

13 exists with respect to flooding, opponents' objections and information only address existing

14 conditions, and fail to dispute or even address the engineering features of the Approved Project

15 developed specifically to prevent flooding of the subterranean garage. Thus, far from a disagreement

16 among experts, the City Council motion again pits supposition against data and wrongly affords them
17 equal weight. Supposition is not substantial evidence when actual data are available, and no

18 substantial evidence supports a fair argument to the contrary.

19 269. Regarding shade and shadow, the City Council motion ignores the City's CEQA

20 Thresholds Guide, which assigns the potential for shade and shadow impacts to occur as a result of

21 buildings 60 feet tall or more, and for sensitive open space areas and residences to comprise the

22 impacted areas. Instead, the City Council motion relies on the potential for shading to occur on nearby

23 commercial properties, which the City has never considered sensitive for the purposes of CEQA

24 analysis. Given the lack of any claimed effect to a shade-sensitive use, no substantial evidence

25 supports fair argument regarding shade and shadow impacts.

26 270. The City Council motion wrongly claims a disagreement among experts exists with

27 respect to traffic safety. Although the motion acknowledges the line-of-sight study provided by a

28

67
First Amended Verified Petition

1 transportation engineer, the motion erroneously elevates opponents' objections-which consist of

2 nothing more than speculation-to the same level as hard measurement data regarding actual

3 visibility conditions that will exist post-development. Again, mere supposition is not substantial
7 1 evidence when actual data are available, and no substantial evidence supports a fair argument that a
significant, unavoidable impact would occur regarding traffic safety.

271. Regarding air quality and noise assumptions, the City Council motion wrongly asserts
the use of a single cement truck and no grading truck trips. A cursory examination of the data sheets

8 for the air quality analysis (Appendix A to the MND) yields a minimum count of six off-road trucks

9 per day for grading alone, and 11 off-road trucks during construction. As stated in the responses to

10 comments, the emissions and noise estimates were based on good-faith estimates of construction

11 equipment during all phases, and assumed hauling and deliveries throughout the construction process,

12 contrary to the purported finding. Because erroneous claims provide the sole basis for the finding on

13 this subject, the claims do not constitute substantial evidence regarding a failure to provide adequate

14 information.

15 272. Similarly, nothing indicates an exceedance of localized significance thresholds

16 established by the South Coast Air Quality Management District; or, at any rate, the Council motion

17 fails to cite such evidence, which does not allow any meaningful evaluation of the finding.

18 273. The City Council motion points to long-abandoned plans for development of 220

19 Culver and 6918 Pacific as evidence that development at either site is reasonably foreseeable. It is

20 not. Moreover, the context-free discussion of the preliminary studies-each of which were completed

21 several years ago -is misleading.

22 274. Development on Legado's other properties is speculative and uncertain. Uncertain

23 future activities that are neither proposed for approval nor reasonably foreseeable consequences of

24 the project do not require analysis in an environmental document. See, e.g., Lake County Energy

25 Council v County of Lake, 70 Cal.App.3d 851 (1977); Save Round Valley Alliance v County of Inyo,

26 157 Cal.App.4th 1437 (2007).

27 275. Lake County Energy involved the analysis of two exploratory geothermal wells. The

28

68
First Amended Verified Petition

analysis was challenged on the grounds that it should have accounted for future commercial

2 geothermal production facilities as part of a comprehensive analysis. However, the court rejected the

3 argument on two grounds: first, development of commercial facilities was uncertain and therefore

4 speculative without test results from the geothermal wells evaluated; and, second, approval of the

5 initial wells did not commit the lead agency to approve any subsequent development of commercial

6 production facilities.

7 276. In Save Round Valley, similar claims regarding the analysis of a residential

8 development also were rejected. Challengers asserted that because the County's code permitted

9 development of second units, the analysis should have accounted for twice as many units as were

10 initially proposed. However, the court concluded that construction of potential second units was

11 speculative and uncertain, irrespective of any requirement (or lack thereof) for discretionary review

12 of second units.

13 277. Here, the relationship between 138 Culver and Legado's other properties is far more
14 attenuated than the relationship between exploratory and potential follow-on commercial geothermal

15 production wells. Where exploratory wells represent a necessary prerequisite to commercial wells,

16 the Project, at 138 Culver, bears no such relationship to the other properties. No approval for any

17 activity associated with development of those properties is at issue here, nor is the Project a necessary

18 prerequisite to development on any other property.

19 278. Similarly, whereas in Save Round Valley, no further discretionary actions were

20 required for the development of second units, development of 200 Culver and 220 Culver would

21 require discretionary approvals (and the appropriate level of review under CEQA). Consequently,

22 those developments would not otherwise evade review.

23 279. Lastly, several comments have asserted that because representatives of the Applicant

24 displayed conceptual renderings of potential buildings on 200 and 220 Culver, development proposals

25 have been developed and/or are pending. However, no development proposal is currently pending for

26 either property, and 220 Culver Boulevard is currently offered for sale. Future development-in

27 whatever form-is speculative and uncertain for either site. Moreover, City procedure regarding

28

69
First Amended Verified Petition

I analysis of cumulative impacts generally deems as foreseeable projects for which an application is

2 pending or for which consultation with the City's Department of Transportation has occurred

3 regarding a traffic impact analysis. Neither has occurred for either property. Consequently, due to

4 the speculative and uncertain nature of development at those sites, CEQA does not require their

5 analysis with respect to the Project.
280. Further, the findings of the City Council are insufficient to support the decision
n reached because they do not justify overturning the approval given by the Director and the DAA, and

8 upheld by the CPC. Among other things, the findings do not establish that the Director or DAA erred

9 or abused their discretion and do not even attempt to explain how the record lacks substantial evidence

10 to support the Director's decision.

15 282. Legado sought the entitlements through the City's defined approval process.

16 283. Legado has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law unless

17 this Court grants the requested writ of mandate.

18 284. Legado has exhausted all administrative remedies available to it. Neither the LAMC

19 nor Charter provides any additional appeals from the decision of the City Council. In addition, and

20 alternatively, to the extent the City contends that administrative appeals are available to Legado,

21 requiring Legado to engage in the lengthy and expensive process of complying with them, when the

22 City has already made and announced a final decision on the matter, would be futile.

8 286. California Code of Civil Procedure § 1094.5 provides that in matters involving a final

9 administrative order or decision made as the result of a proceeding in which by law a hearing is

10 required to be given, evidence is required to be taken, and discretion in the determination of facts is

14 287. An abuse of discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in the manner

15 required by law, its order or decision is not supported by the agency's findings, or the findings are

19 289. Legado has exhausted all required administrative remedies, or is excused from

20 exhausting its remedies as a result of the futility of pursuing such remedies, among other things.

21 290. Section 17.06-A.3 of the LAMC provides that, on appeal of a tract map, the Council

24 provides that, "such decision shall set forth wherein the permit granting authority, or the lower appeal

25 body erred in its action on the permit ..." (Emphasis supplied.)

26 292. The Council erred and abused its discretion by granting the appeal from the decision

14 (Against All Defendants)

15 295. Legado hereby incorporates by this reference the allegations of all previous paragraphs

16 of this Petition as though fully set forth herein.

17 296. The State Housing Accountability Act, Government Code § 65589.5 ("HAA"),

18 prohibits a City from disapproving a housing development project, including reducing density or

19 imposing conditions comparable to a density reduction, unless it finds, based on a preponderance of

20 the evidence, that the project would have an unavoidable impact on public health or safety that cannot

21 be feasibly mitigated in any way other than rejecting the project or reducing its size.

22 297. The HAA provides that when a housing development project complies with the

23 objective standards, the City may not disapprove the project or reduce its density, unless the project

24 would have "an unavoidable impact on public health or safety that cannot be mitigated in any way

25 other than rejecting the project or reducing its size." Gov. Code § 65589.5(k),

2 65589.5(k)(1)(A).

c 299. Pursuant to Gov. Code § 65589.5(f)(1)(4), the standard of review requires that a
project must be considered consistent with objective standards as long as "there is substantial
U evidence that would allow a reasonable person to conclude" that a project complies.
O 300. The Project fully complies with the objective zoning standards set forth in the Los

7 Angeles Municipal Code, State Government Code, Subdivision Map Act, and Coastal Act for

8 approval of the entitlements, including Density Bonus, Site Plan Review, Vesting Tentative Tract

9 Map, and Coastal Development Permit.

10 301. The City Council's decision to disapprove the Project must be set aside because the

11 record contains ample evidence that would allow a reasonable person to conclude the that Approved

12 Project complies with the all objective zoning standards.

13 302. The City Council failed to establish by preponderance of the evidence that the

14 Approved Project created an unavoidable impact on public health or safety that cannot be mitigated

15 In any way other than rejecting the project.

16 303. Section 65589.5(k)(1)(A) provides for issuance of an order setting aside the City's

17 illegal action, as well as payment of attorneys' fees to Legado.

18 304. Sections 65589.5(k)(1)(B) and 65589(1) provide for imposition for violations of the

19 HAA.

20 305. Legado has no administrative remedy and has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in

21 the ordinary course of law. The only remedy provided by law for Legado to obtain relief is this

22 Petition for Writ of Mandate pursuant to California Civil Procedure Code § 1094.5.

23 306. Therefore, Legado is entitled to a writ of mandate ordering the City to invalidate the

up (Against All Defendants)

307. Legado hereby incorporates by this reference the allegations of all previous paragraphs
of this Petition as though fully set forth herein.

308. Government Code section 815.6 provides: "Where a public entity is under a mandatory

8 duty imposed by an enactment that is designed to protect against the risk of a particular kind of injury,

9 the public entity is liable for an injury of that kind proximately caused by its failure to discharge the

10 duty unless the public entity establishes that it exercised reasonable diligence to discharge the duty."

11 309. As explained herein, the HAA imposed mandatory and obligatory duties on the City

12 that required it to approve the Project based on clear implementation guidelines that involved the

13 application of purely objective standards that required no substantial expertise or judgment by the

14 City.

15 310. The mandatory duties on the City, imposed by the State Legislature's enactment and

16 various amendments to the HAA, are "designed" to protect against the particular injury Legado has

17 suffered: that is, wrongful denial of a housing project resulting in substantial development delays and

18 resulting substantial financial and reputational injury.

19 311. Legado has incurred and will continue to incur injury as a proximate result of the City's

20 violation of its mandatory duties under the HAA to approve the proposed development based on its

21 compliance with all applicable objective planning and zoning requirements.

22 312. The City failed to exercise reasonable diligence in denying Legado's Approved Project

23 in violation of its mandatory duties under the HAA.

24 313. Legado has no administrative remedy and has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in

25 the ordinary course of law. The only remedy provided by law for Legado to obtain relief is this

26 Petition for Writ of Mandate pursuant to California Civil Procedure Code § 1094.5.

Code § 65008)

8 315. (Against All Defendants)

9 Legado hereby incorporates by this reference the allegations of all previous paragraphs

10 of this Petition as though fully set forth herein.

11 316. Section 65008(a)(3) of the Government Code invalidates any discriminatory action by

12 a local agency if it denies enjoyment of a residence by reason of a number of factors, including income

13 levels. As alleged above, the City's denial of the Project was motivated by desire to bar Density

14 Bonus projects, including affordable units, from an entire community within the City.

317.

15 Additionally, section 815.6 provides that where a public entity is bound by a

16 mandatory duty imposed by a law enacted to prevent a specific harm, the entity is liable for the injury

17 caused by its failure to discharge that mandatory duty. Here, as alleged above, the HAA imposes

18 upon the City a mandatory duty to approve the Project. The City's failure to discharge that duty was

19 the proximate cause of precisely the kind of harm the HAA and section 65008 of the Government

20 Code were enacted to prevent-the continued erosion of affordable housing opportunities and the

21 increase in the severe market-rate and affordable housing shortfall throughout the State and in the

City.

22 318.

23 In granting the subject appeal and refusing to approve the Director and DAA

24 approvals, the City's actions are discriminatory to residents requiring access to housing affordable to

25 very-low-income families under State and City thresholds and in clear contravention of section 65008.

319.

26 Section 65008(a)(1) invalidates any planning action that denies the enjoyment of

27 residence to any person because of economic factors, including housing availability for persons with

28 very low incomes, as specified in section 65008(a)(3).

75
First Amended Verified Petition

- 320. The City violated section 65008 by granting the appeals challenging Legado's

cn Approved Project, which included residential dwelling units set aside for persons of very low income.

Un the ordinary course of law. The only remedy provided by law for Legado to obtain relief is this
Petition for Writ of Mandate pursuant to California Civil Procedure Code $ 1094.5. §

7 Legado therefore is entitled to a writ of mandate invalidating the City's discriminatory
and unlawful denial of Legado's proposed development.

8 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

9

10 (Petition for Writ of Mandate Under Public Resources Code § 21168 and

11 323. California Code of Civil Procedure § 1094.5; Violation of CEQA)

12 Legado hereby incorporates by this reference the allegations of all previous paragraphs
of this Petition as though fully set forth herein.

13 324.

14 In connection with its rejection of the MND, the City Council abused its discretion,

15 did not proceed in the manner required by law, and failed to act on the basis of substantial evidence.
The City's failures constitute violations of CEQA.

16 325.

17 The MND is legally adequateas determined by the Director of Planning and the

18 CPC--and the City Council's rejection of it was contrary to law. Among other things, the City

19 Council justified its action with statements that ranged from incomplete to demonstrably false, and

20 relied upon exactly the kinds of unsubstantiated opinion or narrative that CEQA precludes from
consideration as substantial evidence.

21 326.

22 A prime example of this was the erroneous claim that no basis existed for evaluating

23 geologic impacts, despite the inclusion in the record of a geotechnical report previously reviewed and

24 approved by the City's Department of Building and Safety. Other, similar errors of law and fact

25 abound, including citations to claims that ignore or simply disregard relevant facts; imputation of the

26 effects of existing environmental conditions to the Project; reliance on evidence that actually

27 contradicts the purported findings; and disregard for the City's adopted impact evaluation procedures

28 and criteria. The City Council motions also attempt to manufacture a "disagreement among experts"

76
First Amended Verified Petition

1 by juxtaposing the factually supported expert opinion in the MND and responses to comments with

2 speculation that actually ignores crucial facts. Lastly, as described above, the City Council's

3 purported findings regarding CEQA fail to meet the legal standard established by the LAMC that

4 requires a showing the lower decisionmakers erred or abused their discretion.

327. These errors of fact and law demonstrate the City's multiple and many-faceted failures
o to proceed in a manner required by the law or support its actions with substantial evidence, in

7 contravention of CEQA.

8 328. Legado, as well as members of the general public-particularly those who need

9 affordable housingwill suffer irreparable harm if the relief requested herein is not granted and the

10 City's Council's unlawful decision is allowed to stand.

11 329. Petitioner complied with Public Resources Code § 21167.5 by a serving a Notice of

12 Intent to File CEQA Petition upon Respondent. The proof of service of the subject Notice is attached

13 hereto as Exhibit "L".

14 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (Petition for Writ of Mandate Under California Code of Civil Procedure § 1094.5;

16 Denial of Procedural Due Process in Violation of the Ralph M. Brown Act, the Fourteenth

17 Amendment of the United States Constitution, and 42 U.S.C. § 1983)

18 330. Legado hereby incorporates by this reference the allegations of all previous paragraphs

19 of this Petition as though fully set forth herein.

20 331. Code of Civil Procedure § 1094.5 provides that a writ of mandate shall issue where an
a 21 administrative agency fails to provide a fair hearing. The City here failed to provide a fair hearing

22 and deprived Legado of its right to due process. Among other things, the City failed to give adequate

23 notice of City hearings; failed to provide Legado or the public with its proposed motions in advance

24 of public hearings, thereby depriving the Legado of a reasonable opportunity to properly analyze,

25 comment upon, and provide input with respect to action on the Approved Project; and failed to

26 provide the legally required opportunity to address the City Council motions.

27 332. As described above, the City Council had more than two months to address the appeals

28
77
First Amended Verified Petition

1 before it, which allowed more than enough time to provide the mere 72 hours of required notice for

2 a regular meeting. Instead, the Council Office orchestrated an unnecessary special meeting, merely

3 days after the PLUM Committee hearing, with the sole purpose of providing a 24-hour notice that

L was intended to deprive and did deprive Legado and supporters of the Approved Project any
1o opportunity to obtain or respond to the planned motions. The City Council compounded this error by
unlawfully depriving Legado and its supporters of any opportunity to address the motions at its

7 hearing.

8 333. Section 54954.3(a) of the Government Code requires notices and agendas for special

9 meetings to give members of the public the opportunity to speak before or during consideration of an

10 item on the agenda.

11 334. The City Council's own rules (see Rule 7) require the provision of an opportunity to

12 comment on an item, unless the item was already subject to hearing and "has not changed

13 substantially" since its consideration by a committee.

14 335. However, as stated above, the City Council illegally refused to accept any public

15 testimony on the item, despite the State-law mandate and the substantial change in the item since its

16 consideration by the PLUM Committee. As detailed above, the CPC report to the PLUM Committee

17 concerned approval of the Approved Project, and the PLUM Committee did not provide any

18 recommended action to the full City Council. Thus, the actual items under consideration at the City

19 Council's special hearing were the motions proposed by the Council Office. These motions-

20 unavailable during the PLUM Committee hearing or at any time prior to their introduction to the full

21 City Council-represent a substantial change and mandated an opportunity for public comment.

22 Legado's representatives submitted speaker cards to the City Council, but were illegally denied any

23 such opportunity.

24 336. To add insult to injury, the City Council violated its own rules to ensure the Council

25 Office received the very time of which it deprived Legado and other community members. Council

26 Rule 32a provides for six minutes of discussion by the party who opens an agenda item for debate

27 (here, Councilmember Bonin), as well as for additional time only where intervening speakers engage

28
78
First Amended Verified Petition

the matter. Yet, despite the lack of discussion or public comment from any party, a and in a blatant

2 display of the attitude "due process for me, but not for thee,« Councilmember Bonin was permitted
to speak against the project for about 15 minutes, or nearly triple the maximum time permitted, while

4 project supporters were denied the opportunity and right to speak at all.
337. Given the deprivation of Petitioners' due process rights, in violation of State law and
6 duly adopted a local procedures, a writ of mandate is required on this record setting aside the City

7 Council motions.

8 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

9 (Violation of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act)

10 (Against All Defendants)

11 338. The California Fair Employment and Housing Act (Govt. Code § 12940 et seq.;

12 "FEHA') provides that it shall be unlawful "[tlo discriminate through public or private land use

13 practices, decisions, and authorizations because of ..  source of income." FEHA further provides that

14 "source of income" includes the perception of the source of income.[1]

15 339. Both written and oral testimony provided during City administrative hearings voiced

16 objections to the density bonus, including the provision of affordable housing units. The City's denial

17 of the Approved Project and the elimination of affordable units has resulted in a discriminatory effect

18 against households of lower sources of income. By capitulating to the blanket rejection of the density

19 bonus and affordable housing by the Neighborhood Council-irrespective of any other factor-the

20 disapproval of low income, density bonus housing units was a "motivating factor" for the City's

21 denial of the Approved Project, even if other factors may have played a role, rendering the land use

22 action unlawful under FEHA.

23 340. Legado has incurred and will continue to incur substantial injury as a proximate result

24 of City's violation of Legado's rights. Pursuant to section 12955.6, Legado seeks an order setting

25 aside the City's unlawful decisions with respect to the Approved Project and ordering the City to

26 adopt new motions denying the appeals that sought to challenge the Approved Project. Legado also

27 seeks compensatory damages from the City in an amount to be proved at trial, but which is at least

(Violation of the Federal Fair Housing Act)

(Against All Defendants)
341. Congress enacted the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq.), or Title VIII of the

7 Civil Rights Act of 1968, to "provide, within constitutional limits, for fair housing throughout the

8 United States. "[2] Courts have affirmed the law prohibits discriminatory zoning practices. See, e.g.,

9 Budnick v. Town of Carefree, 518 F.3d 1109 (9th Cir. 2008).

342. Here, part

10 of the purpose of the City's denial of the Approved Project was to ensure

11 that other Density Bonus projects are not proposed in the Playa Del Rey area: in effect, to continue

12 to prevent, and to preclude in the future, development of affordable housing in the community. This

13 action is nothing short of economic redlining, and all but ensures that housing available to low-income

14 families will never increase, and will continue to erode over time. This economic discrimination is

15 precisely the type of conduct Congress enacted the law to prevent.

343.

16 Legado has incurred and will continue to incur substantial injury as a proximate result

17 of City's discriminatory action. Pursuant to section 3613, Legado seeks an order setting aside the

18 City's unlawful decisions with respect to the Approved Project and ordering the City to adopt new

19 motions denying the appeals that sought to challenge the Approved Project. Legado also seeks

20 compensatory damages from the City in an amount to be proved at trial, but which is at least 25

8 significant personal or property rights" is actionable under the Fourteenth Amendment and Section

9 1983. Galland v. City of Clovis, 24 Cal. 4th 1003 (2001).

10 349. Defendants deliberately and egregiously violated the City's laws with respect to the

l1 City Council's grants of the subject appeals and denying the Project in that the Council willfully

12 refused to follow established law and voted to deny the Project without the required substantial

13 evidence.

14 350. Defendants' flouting of the law has prejudicially, wrongfully, and unlawfully

15 restricted Legado's use and development of the Subject Property. Legado had a reasonable

16 expectation to approval of the necessary Project entitlements, which would have been approved, had

17 the Council followed established law.

18 351. Defendants failed to provide Legado a fair hearing because the City Council became

19 personally embroiled in the controversy and pre-decided the matter without consideration of the

20 evidence and prior to submission of the Project for decision.

21 352. Because of the City Respondents' unlawful acts, Legado has had to employ attorneys

22 to bring this litigation. Legado has incurred and will incur substantial attorneys' fees and litigation

23 costs.

24 353. As a direct and proximate result of the Defendant's actions, Legado has suffered
25 irreparable substantial damages as a result of the loss a of the Approved Project. These damages will

26 be proven at trial, but total at least 25 million dollars.

8 355. The Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution, made applicable to the State

9 of California under the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits the taking of private property for public use

14 a 357. Legado has a substantial investment in the entitlements. Legado expended substantial

15 sums of money designing and engineering the Project and pursuing the entitlements. The entitlements

16 constitute valuable property rights and give the Subject Property substantial monetary value.

17 358. The Council's decision to deny the Project which fully complies with the objective

18 requirements of housing development in a the HAA has effectuated a taking of Legado's Property

19 without just compensation that has significantly and unreasonably interfered with Legado's distinct

CHAPTER III
LAND USE PLAN POLICIES AND PROGRAMS

Chapter III of the plan text contains goals, objectives, policies, and
to programs relating to all land use issues including residential, commercial
and industrial, as well as public and institutional designations. The Planning Department has responsibility for the goals, objectives, policies, initiation, and implementation of the programs contained in this chapter.

RESIDENTIAL The quality of life and stability of neighborhoods throughout the Westchester-Playa del Rey Community Plan Area critically depends on the adequate provision of infrastructure resources (e.g., transportation, police, fire, water, sewerage, parks, etc.) commensurate with the needs
of the population.

If population growth occurs faster than projected, and without needed infrastructure improvements to keep pace with that growth, the quality of
life within the Westchester-Playa del Rey Community would be adversely
affected.

Accordingly, with regard to residential land use planning, the proposed Westchester-Playa del Rey Community Plan has three fundamental
premises.

1) A general limitation of residential densities in various neighborhoods to the prevailing existing density of development
within these neighborhoods.

2) The monitoring of population growth and infrastructure
improvements through the City's Annual Report on Growth and
Infrastructure, with a report to the City Planning Commission
every five years on the Westchester-Playa del Rey Community
following Plan adoption.

3) If this monitoring finds that population in the Plan area is occurring faster than projected; and that infrastructure resource
capacitie are threatened in relation to user need, particularly
critical ones such as water and sewerage, but also including public schools, police and fire services, and transportation infrastructure; and, that there is not a clear commitment to at least begin the necessary improvements within twelve months; then building controls would be put into effect for the affected portions of the Westchester-Playa del Rey Community until land use
designations for the Community Plan and corresponding zoning
are revised to more appropriately limit new development.

The Community Plan includes appropriate policies and implementation
measures generated from the mitigation measures which are listed in the
Environmental Impact Report (EIR) and Transportation Improvement and
Mitigation Program (TIMP). In many instances these measures also encompass the policies contained in the General Plan Framework
Element.

WESTCHESTER-PLAYA DEL REY
III-1

Existing residential land use patterns in the Westchester-Playa del Rey Plan Area include single family and multiple family dwellings. The densities vary from the low to high medium land use categories of the General Plan. Single-family neighborhoods are located widely throughout the area north of Manchester Avenue, while south of the bluffs, including
Kentwood, Loyola Village, and portions of Playa Vista and Playa del Rey.

Concentrations of higher density and multiple-family residential uses are located in the Playa Vista area, in Playa del Rey, along Manchester Avenue between Pershing Drive and Ramsgate Avenue, near La Tijera
Boulevard and Centinela Avenue.

Approximately 2,381 acres are designated for residential uses. Of that amount, 73 percent is designated for Single-Family residential uses.
However, more than 49 percent of the existing dwelling units are in the
Multiple-Family designations. Nearly all of the housing stock has been
built in the post World War II era.

The table below depicts the reasonable expected population and dwelling unit count for the year 2025, using a midpoint range within each residential land use category for the dwelling-units-per-acre category. The
midpoint represents a reasonable assumption, since new development
within each land use category is unlikely to occur at the extremes of the
range, but more likely, throughout the range.

Additional residential capacities are available in other sources. Affordable Housing Incentives/Density Bonuses are set by the California Government
Code Section 56915 and are available for any residential project. The City is following an adopted policy of allowing bonuses of up to 35%. Residential projects that request these incentives must follow additional requirements of the LAMC. Residential uses are permitted in Commercial Land Use areas. Currently, 55-60% of all new multifamily housing is being built in commercial zones throughout the City. The Commercial land use designations include the Residential Accessory Services (RAS) zones as corresponding zones for all Community Plans. Based on this, the Department projects additional housing supplies for approximately 5,000 people. The Department projects that there will be group housing facilities for approximately 3,500 people. Group housing facilities include dormitories, senior housing projects or other similar residential
facilities.

GOAL 1 PROVIDE A SAFE, SECURE, AND HIGH QUALITY RESIDENTIAL
ENVIRONMENT FOR ALL ECONOMIC, AGE, AND ETHNIC
SEGMENTS OF THE WESTCHESTER-PLAYA DEL REY COMMUNITY.

Objective 1-1 Provide for the preservation of existing quality housing, and for the development of new housing to meet the diverse economic and physical needs of the existing residents and expected new residents in the Westchester-Playa del Rey Community Plan Area to the year 2025.

Policies

1-1.1 Protect existing stable single family and low density residential
neighborhoods, such as Kentwood, from encroachment by higher density residential uses and other uses that are incompatible as to scale and character, or would otherwise diminish quality of life.

Program: The Community Plan Map identifies areas where only single family residential development is permitted. These areas
are protected by designating appropriate densities for each land use category designation and for each corresponding zone, to minimize incompatible uses.
1-1.2 The City should promote neighborhood preservation, particularly in existing single family neighborhoods, as well as in areas with
existing multiple family residences.
Program: With the implementation of the Community Plan residential land use categories, all zone changes, subdivisions, variances, conditional uses, specific plans, community and neighborhood revitalization programs for residential projects shall provide for Plan consistency.

Program: The Neighborhood Preservation Program administered
by the City's Housing Department provides financial assistance rehabilitating Single Family homes and Multiple Family housing.
Program: The Homeowners Encouragement Loan Program
(HELP), administered by the City's Housing Department, provides

WESTCHESTER-PLAYA DEL REY
Ill-3

loans to owners of small residential buildings (one to four units)
to correct code violations.

1-1.3 Provide for adequate Multiple Family residential development.
Program: The Community Plan Map designates land for Multiple Family residential development at appropriate locations where it
will be compatible with surrounding land uses and infrastructure.

1-1.4 Provide for housing along mixed-use boulevards where
appropriate.

Program: The Community Plan designates Mixed Use Districts
along targeted boulevards identified in the General Plan
Framework where zoning and/or other incentives encourage the
construction of mixed use development. In accordance with the
General Plan Framework (GPF), Mixed Use Districts are
designated along Culver Boulevard between Pershing Drive and Pacific Avenue, and on Lincoln Boulevard north of Manchester
Avenue.

Objective 1-2 Locate housing near commercial centers, public facilities, and bus routes and other transit services, to reduce vehicular trips and congestion and
increase access to services and facilities.

Policies

1-2.1 Locate higher residential densities near commercial centers, public facilities, bus routes and other transit services.
Program: The plan concentrates most of the higher residential
densities near commercial centers and transit corridors. This
includes various areas along Manchester Avenue, in Playa del Rey, Playa Vista, and near La Tijera Boulevard and Centinela
Avenue.

Objective 1-3 Preserve and enhance the varied and distinct residential character and
integrity of existing residential neighborhoods.

Policies

1-3.1 Promote architectural compatibility and landscaping for new
Multiple Family residential development to protect the character
and scale of existing residential neighborhoods.
Program: Design Guidelines for corresponding Multiple Family Residential Development are listed in Chapter V.
1-3.2 Monitor the impact of new development on residential streets. Locate access to major development projects sO as not to encourage spillover traffic on local residential streets.

WESTCHESTER-PLAYA DEL REY
IlI-4

Program: Incorporate Neighborhood Traffic Mitigation Plans
(NTMP) for major development and provide LADOT assistance
to neighborhoods in design of NTMP's.
1-3.3 Consider factors such as neighborhood character and identity, compatibility of land uses, impact on livability, impacts on services and public facilities, and impacts on traffic levels when changes in residential densities are proposed.
Program: The decision maker should adopt a finding which addresses these factors as part of any decision relating to changes in planned residential densities.

Objective 1-4 Provide affordable housing and increased accessibility to more population
segments, especially students, the disabled and senior citizens.

Policies

1-4.1 Promote greater individual choice in type, quality, price and location of housing.
Program: The plan promotes greater individual choice by allocating adequate lands in the Plan Area for a variety of residential densities, and for the promotion of housing in mixed-
use projects.

1-4.2 Promote the development of housing for persons of low to moderate income within the community.

Program: There are policies in the Municipal Code, such as
Density Bonus, that provide incentives for the development of low to moderate income housing. Within the Coastal Zone, the "Mello Act" requires the provision of low to moderate income housing in
new residential projects where it is deemed feasible, and requires the replacement of existing affordable units demolished or converted to another use. The Departments of Building and Safety, City Planning, and Housing are responsible for
implementing these regulations.

1-4.3 Ensure that new housing opportunities minimize displacement of
residents.

Program: Decision-makers should adopt displacement findings
in decisions relating to the construction of new housing that
displaces residents.

1-4.4 Encourage multiple family residential and mixed use
development in commercial zones, pedestrian oriented areas, and near transit corridors.

Program: The Community Plan identifies areas for mixed-use districts along portions of Lincoln Boulevard in Loyola Village and
Culver Boulevard in Playa del Rey as designated in the General
Plan Framework, and also encourages mixed-use development

WESTCHESTER-PLAYA DEL REY
I1-5

where appropriate within Community and Regional Centers, including Downtown Westchester and Loyola Village. Within designated areas, mixed use development is encouraged through
special zoning, such as the RAS zones, and/or height districts
that provide incentives, including increased floor area, for mixed
use projects.

1-4.5 Encourage senior citizen and disabled housing developments at
convenient locations near public transportation, commercial
services and recreational, cultural, and health facilities, especially within or near Community and Regional Centers.
Program: The Planning and Zone Code includes incentives such
as density bonuses and reduced parking for such housing.

Objective 1-5 Protect established residential neighborhoods from incompatible uses,
including muitiple family residential uses of substantially higher density, to preserve the residential character of these neighborhoods and protect residents from adverse environmental impacts caused by such uses.

Policies

1-5.1 Where possible, do not locate incompatible land uses, including
higher density multiple residential uses, within or in close
proximity to lower density residential neighborhoods, except
where there are adequate buffers, transitional land uses, etc.
Program: The Plan map utilizes land use designations, which are implemented by zoning regulations, to provide for the location of various land uses and residential densities where appropriate and compatible with surrounding development.
Program: The Plan recommends the implementation of zoning conditions to impose appropriate limits on density and/or height in commercial and multiple residential zones adjacent to lower
density residential areas, to address compatibility issues.
1-5.2 The location of institutional uses in residential areas shall be
conditioned so as to avoid adverse impacts on the surrounding
neighborhood.
Program: The Planning and Zoning Code requires Conditional Use Permits for these uses in residential areas. The decision
maker shall consider the possible impacts of any such proposed use on the residential neighborhood, and if it is approved, impose appropriate conditions to mitigate any adverse impacts.

Objective 1-6 Preserve visual resources in residential areas.

Policies

1-6.1 The preservation of existing scenic views from surrounding residential uses, public streets and facilities, or designated scenic

WESTCHESTER-PLAYA DEL REY
III-6

view sites should be a significant consideration in the approval of zone changes, conditional use permits, variances, divisions of land and other discretionary permits.

Program: The possible impacts to existing scenic resources, designated scenic highways or public view sites, and the overall visual quality of adjacent residential areas shall be considered in
the approval of all discretionary permits.

1-6.2 Protect the public views and scenic quality of the highly unique residential areas in this community, such as those located along the coast and on the Westchester Bluffs.

Program: The preservation of public views in coastal areas is major objective of the California Coastal Act of 1976, and will
be implemented through Local Coastal Programs required by State Law to be prepared by the City, and certified by the California Coastal Commission.

Program: The Coastal Bluffs Specific Plan provides restrictions
on height of structures and other measures to protect public views and the scenic quality of the Westchester Bluffs.

COMMERCIAL Commercial land uses form a significant portion of the Westchester-Playa del Rey Community Plan, consisting of 493 acres or 8.5 percent of the total plan
acreage. There are three Regional Commercial Centers and two Community Commercial Centers in the Plan area, as well as a beach-serving commercial
district in Playa del Rey, and another large community-serving commercial
area near Ladera Heights.
Commercial development in the Plan is classified within four primary categories based on the general orientation of uses: Regional, Community,
Neighborhood, and General. The General Plan Framework Element identifies
and sets forth criteria for each of these designations.

REGIONAL There are three major areas in the Plan are designated as Regional
COMMERCIAL Commercial, totaling approximately 321 acres. These areas include:
P Century Boulevard/98th Street Corridor
P Howard Hughes Center
P Playa Vista Regional Commercial Center
Century Boulevard/98th Street Corridor
The Century Boulevard/98th Street Corridor is the eastern gatewayto the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). The area is approximately 67 acres in size, and includes the Century Boulevard and 98th Street frontages, between La Cienega and Sepulveda Boulevards. It has developed as an intensive commercial corridor oriented toward serving visitors and airline travelers, featuring high-rise hotels and office buildings, as well as some low- to mid-rise development. Other uses include restaurants, retail shops, and various other services and facilities. The portion of the corridor north of 98th Street has been underutilized in the

SUBJECT: IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DENSITY BONUS ORDINANCE -
APPLICABILITY OF PRO FORMA FINANCIAL ANALYSES

Discussions recently took place at the City Planning Commission regarding the use of pro
formas or other types of financial analyses in conjunction with density bonus cases. In
particular, a question arose regarding the potential requirement that applicants provide a
pro forma when requesting "on-menu" incentives as part of the Density Bonus Ordinance
[LAMC 12.22 (A)25]. Pro formas or other documentation are already required for requests for off-menu waivers or modification of development standards, per subsection (g)(3).

Density Bonus Law

With SB 1818 (2004), state law created a requirement that local jurisdictions approve a
density bonus and up to three "concessions or incentives" for projects that include defined
levels of affordable housing in their projects. In response to this requirement, the City
created an ordinance that includes a menu of incentives (often called "on-menu"
incentives) comprised of eight zoning adjustments that meet the definition of concessions
or incentives in state law (CA Government Code Section 65915). Separately, the state also
allows developers to request a waiver or modification from other development standards
that preclude development of a density bonus project.

In order to grant approval of an on-menu incentive, the City utilizes the same findings
contained in state law for the approval of incentives or concessions. With regard to the
economic-related finding (c)(i), the City must approve an on-menu incentive unless it finds the incentive "is not required to provide for affordable housing costs." This phrase has prompted the question of how the City a can come to a decision on whether the on-menu incentive provides for housing costs without a detailed pro forma financial analysis. It is
important to note that the finding does not require the incentive to offset affordable housing
costs, or make the project economically feasible.

Analysis

The City's Density Bonus Ordinance requires "a pro forma or other documentation" with
requests for off-menu incentives but has no such requirement for on-menu requests.

The City typically has the discretion to request additional information when it is needed to help make required findings. However, upon careful review, the City believes the level of
detail provided in a typical pro forma is not necessary to make the on-menu finding in
question (c)(i). This is primarily because each of the City's eight on-menu incentives'
provides additional buildable area, which, if requested by a developer, can be assumed to
produce additional project income and therefore provide for affordable housing costs.
Each of the eight on-menu incentives responds to common types of regulatory relief the City was providing prior to the adoption of the ordinance. This further demonstrates the
usefulness of these incentives to housing developers.

Conclusion

The Department concludes that a pro forma financial analysis cannot be required of applicants without a code amendment and that requesting such an analysis would result in little to no value for decision makers. This is because the on-menu incentives have been
pre-evaluated to ensure they all provide for housing costs. A subsequent economic analysis at the project level is therefore not required for projects requesting solely on-menu
incentives.

J The eight on-menu incentives allow for 1) reducing setbacks, 2) reducing lot coverage, 3) reducing lot width, 4) increasing floor area ratios (FAR), 5) increasing height, 6) reducing required open space, 7) allowing for an alternative density calculation that includes streets/alley dedications, and 8) allowing for "averaging" of FAR,
density, parking or open space

SUBJECT: IMPLEMENTATION OF STATE DENSITY BONUS LAWS

On September 28, 2016, Governor Brown signed AB 2501, AB 2556, AB 2442, and AB 1934 which amended the State Density Bonus Law (Government Code Section 65915). The amendments took effect on January 1, 2017. This memo will serve as interim guidance for staff and project applicants and does not create any new or additional City policies or regulations.
Additionally, this memo recognizes changes as a result of amendments made to the State Density Bonus Law through AB 2280 (2008).

Changes in State Law
Numerous minor changes and clarifications were made in the five state laws discussed in this memo. Many of these changes reflect current City practice. A summary of changes in state density
bonus law that will result in significant changes to City practice are listed below. Staff and applicants are encouraged to refer to state law in Government Code Section 65915, as the list below is not an exhaustive list of the changes.
AB 2442
The law expands the categories of housing that can qualify for a density bonus. The following specialized housing types now qualify for an additional density bonus, provided the specialized
units are subject to a very-low income affordability restriction for 55 years:

• 10% of total units reserved for transitional foster youth, as defined in Section 66025.9
of the Education Code; or

• 10% of total units reserved for disabled veterans, as defined in Government Code
Section 18541; or
10% of total units reserved for homeless persons, as defined in the federal McKinney- Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 11301 et seq.). ....
Units set aside to serve these populations will qualify for an additional density bonus of 20% of the number of specialized units (not the total project). Because these units are income restricted, the projects will also qualify for the standard density bonus.

Example: If a site allows a 100 units and 10 (10%) are reserved for transitional foster youth at very low-income, then the project is granted a density bonus of 35 units so long as both conditions are satisfied. The 35 units are derived in this manner:

All Planning Staff
Implementation of State Density Bonus Laws January 18, 2017
Page 2

33 Density Bonus Units - 10 units (10% of total units) set-aside at very low- income = 32.5% density rounded up to 33% = 33 total density bonus units 2 Density Bonus Units - 20% density bonus multiplied by the units giving rise to a density bonus which corresponds to 10 units for very-low income transitional foster youth in this example = 2 total density bonus units
AB 2501
To streamline the density bonus process, the law requires that cities adopt procedures and timelines, provide a list of all documents and information required for an application to be deemed complete, and notify the applicant whether the application is complete in a manner consistent with Section 65943.
The Department has adopted relevant procedures and timelines in Los Angeles Municipal Code Section 12.22 A.25. The list of documents and information required to be deemed complete can be found in the Master Land Use Application packet and the Affordable Housing Referral Form. More information is found in an April 15, 2012 Department memo titled "Affordable Housing
Project Review Procedures." The assigned project planner notifies applicants when their
application has been deemed complete in a manner consistent with Section 65943.
The law also clarifies and amends a number of the density bonus procedures as follows:
1, Density calculations that result in a fractional number are to be rounded-up to the next whole number. This applies to the following:
a. Base density
b. Number of bonus units
C. Number of Affordable Units required to be eligible for the density bonus d. Number of replacement units
e. Number of required parking spaces
2. The ability of a local jurisdiction to require special studies is eliminated unless they meet the
provisions of state law.
Financial pro-formas and third party reviews will no longer be required for any entitlement cases currently pending with the Department or new density bonus case filings.
3. The term "density bonus" is specified to mean a density increase over the maximum allowable gross residential density at the time of the date of the application.
The density bonus provided to a project will be calculated based on the number of units permitted on the date of the density bonus application.
4. A requested concession or incentive shall be granted pursuant to Government Code 65915 unless the City makes a written finding, based on substantial evidence, of any of the following: a) the concession or incentive "does not result in identifiable and actual cost reductions," to provide for affordable housing costs or rents for the targeted units; b) the concession or incentive has a specific adverse impact on public health and safety or the physical environment or on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific, adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable; or c) if the concession or incentive is contrary to state or federal law. Prior law allowed a concession or incentive to be denied if the City had substantial evidence
that the concession or incentive was "not required in order to provide for" affordable housing costs

or rents for the targeted units, or substantial evidence in support of findings "b)" or "c)" above.
AB 2556
The law clarifies the implementation of the required replacement of affordable units in density bonus projects, first introduced by AB 2222 in 2014. The law further defines "equivalent size" to mean that as whole, the new units must contain at least the same total number of bedrooms as the units being replaced. This prevents a developer from replacing multi-family bedroom units
with more units that have fewer bedrooms.
1. For any dwelling units occupied on the date of application, if the income category of the units is not known, it shall be presumed that lower income renter households occupied these units in the same proportion of lower income renter households to all renter households within the jurisdiction, as determined by the most recently available data from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) database. li The current proportion of lower income renter households (defined by those earning less than 80% of AMI in the current 2009-2013 CHAS data) in the City of Los Angeles is 67.5%. This figure was last updated July 6, 2016 and changes annually based on the most recent data. The data source is located here: https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/cp.html.
2. For any dwelling units vacated or demolished within the five-year period preceding the application, if the income category of the units is not known, it shall be presumed that low- and very-low income renter households occupied these units in the same proportion of low- and very-low income renter households to all renter households within the jurisdiction, as determined by the most recently available data from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) database. The current proportion of low-income renter households (defined by those earning between 51%- 80% of AMI in the current 2009-2013 CHAS data) in the City of Los Angeles is 18.8%, and the proportion of very low-income renter households (those earning below 50% of AMI) in the City of Los Angeles is 48.7%. These figures were last updated July 6, 2016 and change annually based
on the most recent data. The

AB 1934
The law provides certain development bonuses for commercial developers of non-residential floor area that partner with affordable housing developers in conjunction with their commercial projects. This law remains in effect only until January 1, 2022, unless repealed earlier.
A commercial developer of non-residential floor area, who has entered into an agreement to ...•..

contribute affordable housing through a joint project (on-site) or two separate projects (off-site), shall be granted a development bonus for the non-residential floor area portion of the project. This may include any of the following incentives as approved by the Department of City Planning:
1. Up to a 20-percent increase in maximum allowable intensity; 2. Up to a 20-percent increase in maximum allowable floor area ratio; 3. Up to a 20-percent increase in maximum height requirements; 4. Up to a 20-percent reduction in minimum parking requirements; 5. Use of a limited-use/limited-application elevator for upper floor accessibility; and 6. An exception to a zoning ordinance or other land use regulation.

In order to qualify for a development bonus under this section, the provision of affordable housing
must comply with the following:
1. A commercial developer shall partner with a housing developer that provides at least 30 percent of the total units for low-income households or at least 15 percent of the total units for very low-income households.
2. An affordable housing agreement between the commercial developer and the housing
developer shall identify how the commercial developer will contribute affordable housing

3. and shall be approved by the Department of City Planning and the Housing and Community Investment Department. The commercial developer may directly build the units, provide land to an affordable housing developer for construction of affordable housing (on site or elsewhere), or make a payment to an affordable housing developer to be used towards the costs of constructing the affordable housing project. 4. An applicant shall be ineligible for a development bonus if the housing replacement

5. provisions of CA Health and Safety Section 65915 (c)(3)(A) are not met. If the developer of the affordable units does not commence and complete the construction of those units in accordance with timelines ascribed by the agreement described in subdivision (c), the local government may withhold certificates of occupancy for the

6. commercial development until the developer has completed construction of the affordable
units.
A development bonus pursuant to this section shall not include a reduction or waiver of payment of a fee for the promotion or provision of affordable housing. 7. If affordable housing is provided off-site, it must be located within the City, in close proximity to public amenities (including schools and employment centers), and within one- half mile of a Major Transit Stop.
AB 2280 (2008)
Adopted in 2008, the same year as the City's density bonus ordinance, AB 2280 made several
minor clarifications, most of which are already reflected in current City practice.
To be consistent with AB 2280, the Department will evaluate requests for a waiver or reduction of development standards (distinct from requested incentives and usually processed via Requests for Waiver or Modification of any Development Standard(s) Not on the Menu pursuant to LAMC 12.22 A.25(g)(3)) based on whether applying the development standard would physically preclude the construction of the housing development project that contains the permitted densities and
incentives.
The bill also deleted the requirement that an applicant for a waiver or reduction in development standards show that the waiver or modification is "necessary to make proposed housing units
economically feasible."

BASIC CITY COUNCIL MEETING RULES

AGENDAS - The City Council meets Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday at 10:00 A.M. The agendas for City Council meetings contain a brief
general description of those items to be considered at the meetings. Council Agendas are available in the Office of the City Clerk, Council and
Public Services Division, Room 395, City Hall, 200 North Spring Street, Los Angeles, CA 90012. and on the City's website at lacity.org; or
lacouncilcalendar.com

Ten (10) members of the Council constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. The Council may consider an item not listed on the agenda
only if it is determined by a two-thirds (10) vote that the need for action arose after the posting of an Agenda. Some items on the agenda may be
approved without any discussion, however, any item may be called "special" by a Councilmember. If an item is called "special" it will be "held" until
the remainder of the items on the Council agenda have been acted on by the Council. An item may also be called "special" if a member of the
public has requested to speak on the item and a public hearing was not previously held.

The City Clerk will announce the items to be considered by the Council, however items will be grouped. For example, all items for which required
public hearings have not previously been held are listed in one section on the printed agenda. The Council President will ask if any
Councilmember or member or the public wishes to speak on one or more of these items. If anyone wishes to speak on an item, it will be called
"special". The remaining in items in this section will be voted on by Council with one roll call vote.

PUBLIC INPUT AT CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS - An opportunity for the public to address the Council on agenda items for which public hearings
have not been held will be provided at the time the item is considered or during the Multiple Agenda Item Comment period. Members of the public
who wish to speak on items shall be allowed to speak for up to one minute per item up to a total a of three minutes per meeting. The Council has
a determined that a cumulative total of 20 minutes is a reasonable minimum amount of time for. the Multiple Agenda Item segment of each regular
meeting.

The Council will also provide an opportunity for the public to speak on public interest items. Each speaker shall be limited to one minute of general
public comment each regular meeting for a cumulative a total of ten (10) minutes. The Council shall not discuss or take action relative to any
general public comment.

If you wish to provide documents to the full Council for consideration on an item, please present the Sergeant-At-Arms with 35 copies. Otherwise,
your materials will simply be added to the official record.

COUNCIL DISCUSSION AND TIME LIMITS - Councilmembers requesting to address the Council will be recognized by the Council President in
the order requested. For any item, the Chairperson of the Committee, or the maker of the original motion, or the member calling a matter "special"
shall have up to six (6) minutes to discuss the item. All other Councilmembers may speak up to three (3) minutes each on the matter. After all
members desiring to speak on a question have had an opportunity to be heard once, the time for each Member desiring to speak again shall be
limited to a maximum of three (3) minutes.

A motion calling the "previous question" may be introduced by any member during a Council debate. If adopted, this motion will terminate debate
on a matter and the Chair will instruct the Clerk to call the roll on the matter.

VOTING AND DISPOSITION OF ITEMS Most items require a majority vote of the entire membership of the Council (8 members). Items which have not been discussed in a Council Committee and have been placed directly on the agenda will require 10 votes to consider. Once considered, these items will normally require eight (8) affirmative votes to be adopted. Ordinances require unanimous vote (at least 12 members must be present) in order to be adopted on first consideration. If an ordinance does not receive the necessary unanimous vote, it is laid over one calendar
week. The votes required for approval on second consideration vary and depend upon the type of ordinance, but a typical ordinance requires eight
(8) affirmative votes upon second consideration.

When debate on an item is completed, the Chair will instruct the Clerk to "call the roll". Every member present must vote for or against each item; abstentions are not permitted. The Clerk will announce the votes on each item. Any member of Council may move to "reconsider" any vote on any

11/6/2018 acity.org/clk/councilagendas/clkcouncilagendas312374172018.html
item on the agenda, except to adjourn, suspend the Rules, or where an intervening event has deprived the Council of jurisdiction, providing that
said member originally voted on the prevailing side of the item. The motion to "reconsider" shall only be in order once during the meeting, and
once during the next regular meeting. The member requesting reconsideration shall identify for all members present the all agenda number, Council file number and subject matter previously voted upon. A motion to reconsider is not debatable and shall require an affirmative vote of eight (8)
members of the Council.

When the Council has failed by sufficient votes to approve or reject an item, and has not lost jurisdiction over the matter, or has not caused it to be
continued beyond the next regular meeting, the item is continued to the next regular meeting for the purpose of allowing the Council to again vote
on the matter.

The City Council rules provide that all items adopted by the Council will not be presented to the Mayor, or other designated officer by the City
Clerk until the adjournment of the regular Council meeting following the date of the Council action. A motion to send an item "forthwith" if adopted
by ten (10) votes, suspends these rules and requires the City Clerk to forward the matter to the Mayor, or other officer, without delay.

RULE 16 MOTIONS - Council Rule No. 16, in part, allows a member to send an item directly to the Council without it having to go to a Council
Committee first, by giving the City Clerk a motion (seconded by an additional member) during a Council session to be placed on the next regular
available Council agenda.
