INTRODUCTION

2 Petitioner SAVE OUR ACCESS-SAN GABRIEL MOUNTAINS ("SOA" or "Petitioner")

3 alleges as follows:

4 1. Petitioner challenges certain discretionary decisions that were made by respondent

5 Watershed Conservation Authority ("WCA" or "Respondent"). Specifically, Petitioner

6 challenges Respondent's approval resolutions (1) certifying the Final Environmental Impact
7 Report prepared for the San Gabriel River Confluence with Cattle Canyon Improvements project
8 and adopting Findings of Fact, and a Mitigation Monitoring and Report Program pursuant to the

9 California Environmental Quality Act; and (2) adopting and approving the San Gabriel River
10 Confluence with Cattle Canyon Concept Site Program Report (collectively, the "Project").

11 2. Petitioner contends WCA's approval of the Project violates provisions of the
12 California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code §§ 21000, et seq.: "CEQA") and
NNVIN Y NOCNTIOOW CIOMIT 13 the Guidelines for Implementation of CEQA (Title 14, Cal. Code of Regs., §§ 15000, et seq.:
14 f NOLLVHOJHOO TVNOISSTHIONJ V the "Guidelines"), a statutory and regulatory framework often referred to as the "Holy Grail" of

15 California's environmental laws.

16 3. Petitioner is challenging the Project because (among other things) it will result in

17 significant impacts on the environment that WCA failed to adequately assess or mitigate in

18 accordance with CEQA and the Guidelines.

19 4. In approving the Project, Respondent disregarded or treated as a mere formality

20 the specific and substantive requirements of CEQA and the Guidelines.

21 5. Petitioner requests that this Court vacate and set aside Respondent's approval of
22 the Project by issuing a writ of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and/or

23 1094.5, directing Respondent to vacate and set aside its approval of the Project. These claims
24 are based on the following allegations:

25 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

26 6. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to sections 1085, 1094.5, and
27 187 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and sections 21168 and/or 21168.5 of the Public Resources

28 Code.

-1-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

7. Venue for this action properly lies in the Los Angeles County Superior Court

2 because Respondent, the Project, and the property are located in Los Angeles County.
3 PARTIES AND BENEFICIAL INTEREST

4 8. Petitioner is a grassroots unincorporated organization composed of and supported
5 by community members and others devoted to the preservation of the environment. Petitioner
6 brings this action for the purpose of (among other things) assuring WCA's compliance with the
7 State's environmental laws. Petitioner's members reside within the County of Los Angeles

8 ("County") and own or rent real property within the County. On behalf of these and other

9 County residents, Petitioner challenges Respondent's approval of the Project.
10 9. Petitioner has associational standing to bring this action and is a party beneficially
11 interested in the issuance of the requested writ of mandate and injunctive and declaratory relief
12 (i) because in accordance subdivision (c) of Public Resources Code section 21177, Petitioner is

NOLLVIOJNOO TVNOISSHONd V NNVIN  NOINHTOON IIOAIIT 13 an organization formed after the approval of the Project to maintain an action against
14 Respondent under CEQA, and (ii) because members of Petitioner complied with subdivisions
15 (a) and (b) of Public Resources Code section 21 177 and exhausted their administrative remedies
16 by timely commenting on and objecting to the Project both orally and in writing. Unless this
17 Court grants the requested writ of mandate, the impacts resulting from Respondent's decision
18 to approve the Project will extend to areas in which Petitioner's members live and will directly
19 and adversely affect their health and living environment. Consequently, Petitioner is directly and
20| beneficially interested in the issuance of the requested writ of mandate.

21 10. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Respondent is
22 a local public entity of the State of California exercising joint powers of (1) the San Gabriel and
23 Lower Los Angeles Rives and Mountains Conservancy, and (2) the Los Angeles County Flood
24 Control District under the Joint Powers law of the State of California, and is situated in the
25 County of Los Angeles. The WCA is responsible for (among other things) implementing and

26 complying with the provisions of CEQA and the Guidelines.
27 11. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of the respondents named
28 herein as DOES 1 through 10, and therefore sues those respondents and real parties in interest

-2-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 by such fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this petition to allege the true names and

2 capacities of those Doe parties when ascertained. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that

3 basis alleges, that each of the parties designated herein as a Doe is responsible in some manner

4 for the events and actions referred to herein.

5 12. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that at all relevant

6 times Respondent and the Doe respondents and real parties in interest were and are the agents

7 of each other, authorized to do the acts herein alleged, each of which was ratified by the others.

8 13. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, or otherwise of Does

9 1 through 10 are unknown to Petitioner who therefore sues Does 1 through 10 by such fictitious
10 names. Petitioner will amend this petition to allege the true names and capacities of the Doe

11 respondents when the same becomes known to it. Reference to "Respondent" or "WCA" herein
12 shall mean the named respondents and Does 1 through 10. 1

13 14. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Respondent and
NOLIVHOJNOO TVNOISSILIONJ V NNVIN * NOCNH IOOW CIOHII 14 each of the Does proximately caused the acts, omissions to act, and/or injuries herein alleged.

15 15. Respondent is, and at all times relevant herein has been, charged by law with the
16 performance of all duties arising under CEQA and the Guidelines, including (but not limited to)
17 the preparation of factually accurate and legally adequate environmental documentation for the
18 Project.

19 16. Petitioner has exhausted all legally available administrative remedies against

20 Respondent's decision to use a defective environmental impact report ("EIR) to approve the
21 Project as being in compliance with CEQA and the Guidelines. The decision of Respondent to

22 approve the Project is a final determination. If the Court does not grant the relief prayed for
23 herein, Petitioner will suffer irreparable injury for which it has no adequate remedy at law, there
24 will be a waste, and the failure to enjoin further conduct may tend to render the judgment in this
25 action ineffectual.

26 17. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
27 21167.5 by sending, via United States Postal Service, written notice of this action to Respondent,
28 and a copy of that written is attached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated herein by reference.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 18. Petitioner will comply with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

2 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 by furnishing a copy of this Verified Petition

3 for Writ of Mandate to the California Attorney General in accordance with Public Resources

4 Code section 21167.7.

5 ALLEGATIONS COMMON TO ALL CAUSES OF ACTION

6 19. With the stroke of a pen, President Obama created the San Gabriel Mountains

7 National Monument in 2014. Each year, over 25,000 hikers and others depart from the parking
area at the terminus of Camp Bonita Road to hike to "Bridge to Nowhere," one of the

9 Monument's most famous features and located on a private property inholding within the
10 Monument. Shortly after President Obama created the San Gabriel Mountains National
11 Monument, the US Forest Service (USFS) began a series of attacks to shut down public land in

12 this area including the trail leading to the Bridge to Nowhere.

20. Respondent shares the USFS's goal of shutting down the public's access to the
& NOLLVHOJHOO TVNOISSAMONd 1 NNVW 28 NOCNHIOOW IIOHIAT 13

14 Bridge to Nowhere and coordinated the preparation of a hybrid environmental impact statement/
15 environmental impact report ("EIR") to use as a pretext for accomplishing this.

16 21. Central to Respondent's efforts to shut down public access, it came up with a
17 project initially named, "East Fork Project" and later changed officially to the "San Gabriel
18 River Confluence with Cattle Canyon Improvement Project," colloquially, known as the "Cattle

19 Canyon Project" (the "Project"). For example, the initial 2016 version of the Project included
20 installing a gate at the Cattle Canyon Bridge to block Camp Bonita Road approximately half a
21 mile from the the trailhead parking area. Due to public outcry, the gate was removed from the

22 next draft of the Project.

23 22. Despite the objections of numerous members of the public over the course of
24 several public meetings Respondent held regarding the Project, at which it received objective
25 evidence demonstrating that the EIR contained factual errors and was fundamentally flawed, on
26 October 25, 2018, Respondent certified the EIR and approved the Project.

27 23. On October 30, 2018, Respondent caused to be posted at Los Angeles County
28 Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk's office a Notice of Determination for the Project.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Against Respondent for issuance of a writ of mandate pursuant
3 to Pub. Resources Code § 21168; Failure to Comply with CEQA)
4 24. Petitioner realleges paragraphs 1 through 23.
5 A. Violation of CEQA and the Guidelines:

25. CEQA serves two basic, interrelated functions: ensuring environmental protection
and encouraging governmental transparency. (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors
8 (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564.) It accomplishes this by requiring full disclosure of a project's

9 significant environmental effects so that decision-makers and the public are informed of these
10 consequences before project is approved to ensure government officials are held accountable
11 for these effects. (Laurel Heights Improvement Association of San Francisco v. Regents of the
12 University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392.)
13 26. CEQA applies to all "governmental agencies at all levels" and requires lead NOLIVHOJHOO TVNOISSTHOaJ V NNVIN 29 NOCNH IOOI CIOHHT 14| agencies to review the environmental impacts of all projects. Under Public Resources Code
15 section 21065, a project is any discretionary "activity which may cause either a direct physical
16 change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the
17 environment."

18 27. In order for an EIR to be legally adequate, it must comport with certain
19 requirements set forth in CEQA and the CEQA Guidélines.
20 28. Respondent further did not proceed in the manner required by law in that it
biased in favor of the proposed Project's approval and, therefore, 21 produced an EIR that was
22 failed to constitute the full disclosure document intended to objectively inform decision-makers
23 and the public of the Project's true impacts, mitigation measures, and alternatives.
24 29. Respondent's certification that the EIR satisfied the requirements mandated by
25 CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines constitutes an abuse of discretion in that Respondent failed
26 to proceed in the manner required by law, and its decision is not supported by substantial
27 evidence, as follows:

28

-5-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

a. Relied on an incomplete and unstable description of the Project by failing to

2 include specifics about a number of project components;

3 b. Failed to adequately disclose or analyze the Project's significant impacts on the
environment;
400 0 c a C. Failed to identify, analyze, or adopt feasible and enforceable mitigation measures
to reduce or avoid the impacts of the Project;
d. Failed to adequately disclose, analyze, or mitigate the Project's significant
cumulative impacts;

e. Failed to adequately consider a reasonable range of alternatives, including the
10 preferred open space alternative;

11 f. Improperly deferred mitigation measures and analysis of Project impacts; and
12 g. Failed to address significant new information and thereafter recirculate at least

13 portions of the Final EIR. NOLLVAONOD TVNOISSTONJ V NNVN  NOINHIOOW CIOHIT 14 30. CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines require Respondent to address comments and
15 suggestions raised during the EIR review process and to prepare a good faith, reasoned analysis
16 in response to all significant issues raised. Respondent did not proceed in the manner required
17 by law in that it failed to adequately and accurately provide good faith, reasoned responses to
18 comments made during the CEQA public review process, including (but not limited to)
19 inadequate responses to comments raised concerning the Project's environmental impacts and
20 feasible mitigation measures and alternatives.
31. CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines require that the lead agency make certain written
22 findings and that the findings must be supported by substantial evidence in the record. 21

23 Respondent did not proceed in the manner required by law in that it failed to adopt findings that
24 are supported by substantial evidence.
25 32. Respondent did not proceed in the manner required by law in that it failed to adopt
26 findings that adequately discussed all significant Project impacts, failed to make adequate
27 specific findings with regard to the feasibility of each mitigation measure and each alternative

28 identified in the EIR, failed to adopt all feasible mitigation measures as well as feasible and

-6-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 environmentally superior alternatives, and failed to adequately identify considerations which

2 would make infeasible or override those mitigation measures and alternatives.

3 33. CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines require that Respondent adopt feasible

4 mitigation measures to avoid significant environmental impacts. Respondent did not proceed

5 in the manner required by law in that it failed to prepare an adequate EIR by not examining and
6 discussing potential mitigation measures that would substantially lessen the Project's potentially

7 significant adverse impacts.

8 34. CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines require that Respondent analyze a reasonable

9 range of alternatives to avoid significant environmental impacts. Respondent failed to prepare
10 an adequate EIR by not analyzing a reasonable range of alternatives to the Project, including

11 feasible alternatives that are environmentally superior.

12 35. Respondent failed to prepare an adequate EIR by not fully examining the
13 alternatives that would mitigate or eliminate the Project's adverse impacts. Because Respondent NOLLVHOdHOO TVNOISSHONd & NNVI * NOCNETIOOW IIOMIIT 14 did not proceed in the manner required by law, its approval of the EIR should be set aside.
15 B. Propriety of Relief Under C.C.P. §§1085 et seq., and/or §§1094.5 et seq.
16 36. Respondent has the legal duty in making their determinations to comply with the
17 applicable law governing such legislative acts. In particular, Respondent has the legal and
18 non-discretionary duty to act in accordance with the requirements of CEQA, the CEQA
19 Guidelines, and other applicable laws and regulations.

20 37. Respondent acted arbitrarily, capriciously, irrationally, and unreasonably, and
21 without any or an adequate evidentiary basis in failing or refusing to comply with the
22 requirements of CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, and other applicable laws and regulations. At

23 all times material hereto, Respondent had, and continues to have, the ability to comply with its
24 legal duties. Notwithstanding the efforts of Petitioner and others to inform Respondent of its

25 legal duties, and to induce Respondent to comply with its legal duties, Respondent has failed and

26 refused to perform these duties as described herein.
27 38. The decision of Respondent to approve the Project constitutes a final decision as

28 contemplated in Section 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

-7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

39.

2 provision known to Petitioner for any further administrative remedial action from the decision F Petitioner has exhausted all available administrative remedies. There is no

3 of Respondent to approve the Project.

4 40. Respondent has prejudicially abused its discretion by approving the Project
5 permitting the acts and omissions described herein to occur.
6 41. In acting and failing to act in the manner described above, Respondent has acted
7 in an arbitrary, capricious, and irrational manner lacking any reasonable basis, in violation of
8 Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1085 et seq.
42. Petitioner is beneficially interested in issuance of the peremptory writ of mandate
10 as prayed for hereafter. Petitioner will be seriously harmed if Respondent proceeds with the 9

11 Project without first complying with applicable laws and regulations.
43. At all times material hereto, Respondent has been able to perform its duties and
NNVI * NOONHTOOW CIOHIT 13 obligations as demanded by Petitioner. Respondent has, however, failed and refused to undertake 12

NOLLVAOJHOO TVNOISSHLIONI 14 its obligations. Respondent has failed and refused to require or to perform any of the above,
15 notwithstanding the substantial evidence presented to Petitioner and others that such failures and
16 refusals are contrary to law and will have adverse consequences on Petitioner.
17 44. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law other than the relief
18 sought in this petition. In acting and failing to act in the manner described above, Respondent
19 has prejudicially abused their discretion in approving the Project, in violation of Code of Civil
20 Procedures Section 1094.5 et seq.
PRAYER 21

22 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays as follows:
23 1. On the first cause of action, for a judgment granting a peremptory writ of mandate
pursuant to the Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 et seq. and/or section 1094.5 et seq., 24

25 commanding Respondent to set aside its approval of the Project and ordering Respondent to take
26 no further steps toward implementing the Project unless and until it fully complies with CEQA
27 and the Guidelines, the Guidelines, and all other applicable laws and regulations.
