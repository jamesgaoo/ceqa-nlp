INTRODUCTION 24

25 In this action petitioner SAVE THE CANYONS COALITION (the "Coalition" or "Petitioner")
26 challenges specific violations of law by respondents COUNTY OF ORANGE (the "County") and
27 ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ("Board") (County and Board are collectively
28 referred to herein as "Respondents"), as follows:

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 1.

3 Petitioner challenges the decision of respondent Board, as the elected legislative
body for respondent County, to approve the application submitted by real parties in interest Red

4

5 Rock Chateau Wedding Center, Nabhan Simaan, Yola Simaan and James Miller (collectively
"RPIs") to develop the so-called "Red Rock [Wedding] Gardens" project (the "Project") in the

6 unincorporated community of Silverado, consisting of Planning Application PA080053 for a Use

7 Permit to use an existing single-family dwelling on a 3.93-acre site (the "Site") for outdoor
special events (weddings, anniversaries, parties, and fund raisers) with live entertainment and
8 up to 20 event staff and 200 guests per
9 2. event for a maximum of 12 events per year.

10

11 Petitioner contends that County's preparation of a mitigated negative declaration

12 ("MND") for the Project, and the Board's approval of that MND, violated specific provisions

LEIBOLD McCLENDON & MANN A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION 13 of the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code § 21000, et seq.: "CEQA")

8 14 and the Guidelines for Implementation of CEQA (Tit. 14, Cal. Code Regs., § 15000, et seq.: the

15 "CEQA Guidelines"), a statutory and regulatory framework commonly referred to as "the Holy
Grail of California's environmental laws."

3. Petitioner also contends that Respondents' approval of the Project violated specific
16 requirements of California's Planning and Zoning Law (Gov. Code § 65000, et seq.: the "PZL")
17 as well as the County's General Plan, Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan, and Zoning Code

27 This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to sections 187 and 1094.5
of the Code of Civil Procedure, and section 21168 of the Public Resources Code.

28 Respondents and the Site are located in Orange County.

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

PARTIES AND BENEFICIAL INTEREST 1

2 7. Petitioner is an unincorporated umbrella organization composed of and supported
3 by grassroots community groups, a non-profit 501(c)(3) environmental corporation, and others
devoted to the preservation of the environment. These three groups - the Saddleback Canyons
5 Conservancy, Rural Canyons Conservation Fund, and Friends of Harbors, Beaches and Parks,
6

public in assuring local compliance with California's environmental and land use laws. Inc., were organized for the purpose of (among other things) representing the interests of the

8 Petitioner's members reside within the unincorporated Orange County communities in and
around Modjeska Canyon, Silverado Canyon and Santiago Canyon and/or own real property
10 within that area. On behalf of Petitioner's members, their respective constituents in the Canyon
11 communities, and other Orange County residents, Petitioner challenges Respondents' approval
NNVTN 12 of the Project and adoption of the MND.
NOLLVHOdHOO TVNOISSHIONd V - 13 8. Petitioner has associational standing to bring this action and is a party beneficially & 14 interested in the issuance of the requested writ of mandate (i) because in accordance with NOCNIIOOW IIOHIIT 15 subdivision (c) of Public Resources Code section 21177, Petitioner is an organization formed
16 after the approval of the Project to maintain an action against Respondents under CEQA, and
17 (ii) because certain members of Petitioner-including individuals who are members of the three
18 groups comprising Petitioner-complied with subdivisions (a) and (b) of Public Resources Code
19 section 21177, and exhausted their administrative remedies by timely commenting on and
20 objecting' to the contents and adequacy of the MND. and the Project both orally and in writing.
9.
22 Respondents' decision to approve the Project and adopt the MND will extend to areas in which 21 Unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate, the impacts resulting from

23 numerous citizens represented by Petitioner live and will directly and adversely affect their
24 health and living environment. Consequently, Petitioner is directly and beneficially interested
25 in the issuance of the requested writ of mandate.
26 10. Respondent County is a public body, corporate and politic, organized and existing
27 under and by virtue of the laws of the State of California and is responsible for regulating and
28 controlling land use in all areas within unincorporated areas of the County, including (but not
-3-
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 limited to) implementing and complying with the provisions of CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines,

3 the PZL, and the County's General Plan, Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan and Zoning Code.
11.

4 Respondent Board is the duly constituted legislative body for Respondent County.

5 As such, Board is the governing body of County, and is responsible for carrying out County's
statutorily mandated duties, including (but not limited to) the formulation and implementation
of land use plans in the County and the preparation of CEQA documents for those plans.
12. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that real party in
8 interest Red Rock Chateau Wedding Center (*Wedding Center") is a business of unknown type
9 and a recipient of the approval that is the subject of this action since it was identified in County
10 staff reports, agendas, and other materials as the applicant for the Project's approvals.
11 13.

NNVII Y NOINIIOOW CIOHET Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that real parties in

A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION 12 interest Nabhan Simaan and Yola Simaan (collectively, "Owners") are

13 husband and wife who

own the Project Site at 17521 Santiago Canyon Road upon which they conduct a commercial
14 business under the fictitious names "Red Rock Chateau Wedding Center" and/or "Red Rock
15 Gardens" and are recipients of the approval that is the subject of this action.

16 14. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that real party in
17 interest James LeRoy Miller ("Miller"), acting as Owners' agent, is also a recipient of the

18 approval that is the subject of this action since he was identified in County staff reports, agendas,
19 and other materials as the applicant for the Project's approvals and therefore, in an abundance
20 of caution, Petitioner names him in this action. F:•1

21 15.

22 Since Respondents did not publicly identify any other persons or entities as

23 recipients of the approval that is the subject of this action, Petitioner believes it has complied

24 with subdivision (a) of Public Resources Code section 21167.6.5.
16. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of the respondents named
25 herein as DOES 1 through 1 10, and the real parties in interest named herein as DOES 11 through
26 25, inclusive, and therefore sues those respondents and real parties in interest by such fictitious
27 names. Petitioner will amend this petition to allege the true names and capacities of those Doe
28 parties when ascertained. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that each
-4-
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 of the parties designated herein as a Doe is responsible in some manner for the events and
2 actions referred to herein.

17. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that at all relevant
4 times the County, the Board, Wedding Center, Owners, Miller, and the Doe respondents and/or 3

5 real parties in interest were and are the agents of each other, authorized to do the acts herein
6 alleged, each of which was ratified by the others.
18. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, or otherwise of Does
8 through 25 are unknown to Petitioner who therefore sues Does 1 through 25 by such fictitious
names. Petitioner will amend this petition to allege the true names and capacities of the Doe
10 respondents when the same becomes known to it. Reference to "County," "Board," or
11 "Respondents" herein shall mean the named respondents and Does 1 through 10, and reference
12 to "Wedding Center," "'Owners,' "Miller," or "RPIs" shall mean the named real parties in NNVIN NOLIVHOdHOO TVNOISSHIOHI 13 interest and Does 11 through 25.
d8 14 19. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that Respondents, NOCNHIOOW IIOHIAT 15 RPIs and each of the Does proximately caused the acts, omissions to act, and/or injuries herein
16 alleged.
17 ALLEGATIONS COMMON TO ALL CAUSES OF ACTION

18 20. The Site is located at the southern end of the Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan ¢
19 area which is designated "Rural Residential." The Site is zoned "A1, General Agricultural" and
20 has a lawfully established single-family dyvelling. Other Site improvements exist that have been

22 reception facility. The Site is surrounded by open space uses. To the south of the Site is 21 used for commercial weddings and receptions, including a dirt parking area and an indoor

23 Whiting Ranch Wilderness Park, and to the east across Santiago Canyon Road, along Gertner
24 Estate Road is other rural residential development.

26 Court to violating the County's Zoning Code by conducting commercial weddings at the Site 25 21. In 2000, the operators of Red Rock Chateau Wedding Center plead guilty in this

27 without proper zoning permits. Thereafter, the Owners sought permission for a project similar
28 to the Project-to conduct 35 commercial outdoor events on the Site-that the County
-5-
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

designated as Use Permit Application PA000125, and on June 27, 2001, the County's Planning
2 Commission, by a vote of 4 to 0, denied the Owners' project based on its incompatibility to the
surrounding land uses, traffic generation, and other considerations.

4 22. On July 12, 2001, the Owners appealed the Planning Commission's denial to the

5 Board, and on September 25, 2001, the Board remanded the Owners' application to the Planning
6 Commission for reconsideration. On December 19, 2001, the Planning Commission reaffirmed
7 its denial.

8 23. Thereafter, in response to a second appeal, on March 19, 2002, the Board upheld
the Planning Commission's second denial, finding that it "[a]grees with it the determination that
10 the proposed use as a commercial wedding center is not compatible with the surrounding uses

1 and the A1 'General Agriculture'."
NNVI 7 NOINIIOOW CIOHIIT 12 24. On September 18, 2003, the Owners filed an application for a commercial wedding
A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION 13 and events center that essentially duplicated its prior application excepting for reducing the
14 number of events from 35 to 22. In its report dated May 4, 2005, County planning staff

15 recommended denial of the Owners' application based on General Plan inconsistency, noise
16 impacts to residents and wildlife, traffic safety, conflicts with the Fire Code for a commercial
17 use for indoor activities, and septic system capacity. The Planning Commission then continued

18 the matter to a date uncertain, and the application was ultimately closed in 2008 due to inactivity.

19 25. From 2000 through 2004, the Owners held wedding events on the Site under 16

20 Temporary Use Permits ("TUPs") issued by the County, but from 2005 through late 2015, the

21 County revoked further granting of TUPs for wedding events due to code violations occurring
22 on the Site, nonconformance with the Zoning Code related to the commercial activities occurring
23 on the Site, and lack of resolution of noise, fire protection, and traffic control. In November of
24 2015, the County reinstated the Owner's access to TUPs, but they did not thereafter seek any.

25 26. The Planning Commission considered the Project at its September 27, 2017,
26 meeting. County planning staff recommended denial of the Project based on staff's analysis that
27 the Project was inconsistent with the County's General Plan, Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan

28 and zoning for the Site. At the meeting, the Planning Commission received the staff report and
-6-
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

2 public testimony from interested members of the public and continued the item, directing staff

3 to circulate the MND and return with additional information on fire and

27. traffic safety.
At the Planning Commission's December 13, 2017 meeting, County planning staff

5 reported back that the MND had been circulated, provided the public comments received related
to the MND, and furnished the requested traffic and fire related impact and mitigation
6 information. The Planning Commission continued the Project a second time to its January 24,
7 2018 meeting with directions to staff to reach out to RPIs

8 Amendment for the Project. to discuss the option of a General Plan

9 28. On January 10, 2018, County planning staff met with the applicant's
10 representatives via conference call to outline the General Plan amendment process as it would
11 apply to the Project.

MANN 12 29.

13 At the January 24, 2018, Planning Commission meeting planning staff reported

dè
LEIBOLD McCLENDON NOLIVHOdHOO IVNOISSHIONI V 14 to the Planning Commission on the results of the discussion with Wedding Center, Owners,
Miller, and their environmental consultant. Following the discussion, the Planning Commission
15 voted to adopt the MND and approve PA080053, subject to certain findings and conditions of
16 approval, which included a reduction in the number of events allowed per year from 20 to 12,
17 and RPIs agreed to this reduction.
18 30. On February 6, 2018, the Saddleback Canyons Conservancy and Rural Canyons
19 Conservation Fund jointly filed an appeal to the January 24, 2018, Planning Commission
20  approval of the Project and adoption of the MND, raising the following issues: (1) the Project
21 is not consistent with the County's General Plan; (2) the Project is not consistent with the
22 Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan; (3) the Project is not consistent with the County's Zoning
23 Code; (4) in approving the Project, the Planning Commission improperly granted a defacto
24 zoning variance; and (5) the Project's approval violated CEQA.
25 31. On February 7, 2018, the Inter-Canyon League filed an appeal to the January 24,
26 2018, Planning Commission approval and adoption of the MND and raised the following issues:
27 (1) commercial land use is inconsistent with the General Plan; (2) commercial land use is
28 inconsistent with the Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan; (3) commercial land use is inconsistent
-7-
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 with the County's Zoning Code; (4) additional traffic from the events would make the road even
2 more dangerous than it is currently; (5) CEQA requirements are not met; and (6) the Planning
3 Commission abused its discretion by interpreting words to mean the opposite, placing a higher
value on a commercial use compared to other neighbors' use of their neighborhood and granting

5 a reduced number of events with the intent of granting more at a later date.

6 32. Thereafter, County planning staff's, recognizing that the Board's rejection of the

7 appeals and affirmation of the Planning Commission's decision would likely result in litigation

8 against the County, on April 6, 2018, the County's Députy Director of Development Services/
9 Planning signed an indemnification agreement in which Nabhan Simaan agreed, at his own
10 expense, to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the County in any action brought against it "to

11 attack, set aside, void or annul any approval of the Project."

NNVIN  NOUNHIOOW ITOHITI 12 33. On April 10, 2018, the Board conducted a public hearing on the Project at which

8 A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION 13 time many persons again spoke in opposition to the Project. After receiving extensive testimony,
14 and in complete disregard of widespread community opposition to the Project and County
15 Counsel and planning staff cautioning the Board that the Project was inconsistent with the
16| County's General Plan, Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan and Zoning Code, the Board approved

17 the Project and adopted the MND.
18 34. On April 12, 2018, the County filed and posted a Notice of Determination of the

19 Board's adoption of the MND for the Project.
20 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION (AGAINST RESPONDENTS)
21 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

22 35. Petitioner realleges paragraphs 1 through 34.

23 A. VIOLATION OF THE PZL

24 36. Respondents are, and at all times relevant herein have been, charged by law with
25 the performance of all duties arising under the PZL, including faithfully implementing the PZL's
26 legislative limitations and mandates imposed on the land use decisions of cities and counties.

27 37. Despite the Site being located in the County's lowest intensity residential land use
28 designation-the 1A "Rural Residential"zone-and despite County staff expressly cautioning
-8-
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

that commercial uses such as the Project are not permitted in that zone, the Planning
2 Commission and Board nevertheless approved the Project.
38. In approving the Project, Respondents violated the PZL's anti-spot zoning
4 "uniformity requirement," i.e., Government Code section 65852. As explained in Neighbors in
5 Support of Appropriate Land Use v. County of Tuolumne (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 997,
6 Government Code section 65852 is
"like an enforcement clause, allowing parties to the [comprehensive

•- 7

:* 8 zoning plan] contract to challenge bürdens unfairly imposed on
9 them or benefits conferred on others. According to a leading
10 treatise, section 65852 'is intended to prevent unreasonable
11 discrimination against or benefit to particular properties within a
given zone.' (4 Manaster & Selmi, Cal. Environmental Law and NNVW 12
NOLIVAOdHOO TVNOISSHJONJ V 13 Land Use, supra, Zoning, § 60.70, p. 60-114.3 (rel. co? 45-9/06)].)"
8 14 NOINIIOOW CIOHIIT (Id. at p. 1009; emphasis added.)
15 B. VIOLATION OF THE COUNTY'S GENERAL PLAN

16 39. "The Legislature has mandated that every county and city must adopt a
17 'comprehensive, long-term general plan for the physical development of the county or city, and
18 of any land outside its boundaries which in the planning agency's judgment bears relation to its
19 planning.' (Gov. Code, § 65300.) [] '[T]he propriety of virtually any local decision affecting
20| land use and development depends upon consistency with the applicable general plan and its
21 elements.™* (Citizens of Goleta Valley V. Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 570.)
22 40. "Although use permits are not explicitly made subject to a general plan meeting
23 the requirement of state law, that condition is necessarily to be implied from the hierarchical
24 relationship of land use laws. Thus, use permits are struck from the mold of the zoning law, the
25 zoning law must comply with the adopted general plan, and the adopted general plan must
26 conform with state law; the validity of the permit process derives from compliance with this
27 hierarchy of planning laws (Neighborhood Action Group v. County of Calaveras (1984) 156
28 Cal.App.3d 1176).

-9-
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

41. County planning staff's September 27, 2017 report to the Planning Commission

2 provided "[a] detailed analysis of the [Project's] land use consistency with the Orange County

3 General Plan, Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan and Zoning Code." The report concluded that
"The proposed project is not consistent with the 1A land use designation because it proposes a
commercial use in a designation intended for low density single-family residential development."
6 Explaining this conclusion, the report further noted that,

7 "The 1A residential land category does not allow for

8 neighborhood/convenience commercial sites as described:
9 Neighborhood/convenience commercial sites are assumed to
10 be consistent with 1B 'Suburban Residential' designated

11 areas, subject to the Neighborhood Commercial guidelines

LEIBOLD McCLENDON & MANN & 12 contained herein. These sites are not identified on the Land
NOLLVHONOO TVNOISSHIOHJ V 13 Use Map. Source: Land Use Element, Revised October

14 2015, page III-10
15 Because the site is designated 1A 'Rural Residential' and not 1B

16 'Suburban Residential', the proposed commercial use is not
17 consistent and could not be established under the General Plan.

18 Additionally, the use as proposed is intended to serve more than just

19 the local area and it would not be considered neighborhood/

20 convenience commercial."

21 42. In a section "Inconsistency with Adjacent Land Use Designations," the report

22 noted:

23 "The land adjacent to the project site within the County

24 unincorporated area is also designated as 1A "Rural Residential".

25 The land adjacent to the southern project site boundary is

26 designated by the City of Lake Forest General Plan as Regional

27 Park/Open Space. Establishing a commercial land use would not be

28 compatible with the adjacent General Plan land use designations."
-10-
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

P 43. The staff report summarized its findings as follows: "The proposed project is not
2 consistent with the 1A "Rural Residential" Land Use Designation, nor is it consistent with the
3 neighborhood/convenience commercial sites location criteria. Also, a commercial project of this

4 nature is not consistent with the adjacent General Plan land use designations."
5 44. As noted above, the Land Use Element of the County's General Plan designates
6 the Project site as 1A, "Rural Residential," which allows residential land uses only and does not
7 allow the commercial uses such as the Project.
8 "This category is applied to areas in which limited residential use
9 is compatible with the natural character of the terrain. Development
10 under this category will require special consideration due to
11 topography and other factors. The building intensity standard for
Rural Residential ranges from 0.025 to 0.5 dwelling units per gross NNVT NOINHIOOW CIOHIT 12

13 acre (DU/AC)."
& NOLIVAOdHOO TVNOISSAIOHJ V 14 (Orange County General Plan, Land Use Element, page III-12.) While the Land Use Element
15 makes explicit allowance for specific commercial uses under other designations, it does not do
16 so for the Project's 1A designation.
17 45. Respondents' approval of the Project violates state law requiring that all
18 development be consistent with a county's adopted general plan.
19 C. VIOLATION OF THE COUNTY'S SILVERADO-MODJESKA SPECIFIC PLAN
20 46. At one time, County officials believed that: because the Silverado-Modjeska
21 Specific Plan area was adopted in 1977 by resolution instead of by ordinance, development
22 within the plan's area did not have to comply with it. However, in 2016, Petitioner provided the
a 23 County with a legal analysis on this issue, and since that time the County has taken the position
24 that development with the Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan area must be consistent with it. A
25 true and correct copy of the 2016 legal analysis was attached to the Petition as Exhibit 2.
47. In keeping with County planning staff's position regarding the applicability of the
27 Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan, staff's September 27, 2017 report to the Planning 26

28 Commission noted that:

-11-
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Aw0- "Claims have been made that the Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan
is not an enforceable document as it is a policy level document,
however this is not the case and all projects in the specific plan area
must be consistent with the specific plan. This is similar to a
General Plan which is also a policy level document and all
development must be consistent with the general plan in order to

8 48. make the necessary findings as defined in the zoning code."
In comparing the Project to the Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan, County
9 planning staff concluded that the Project was "not consistent with the Rural Residential Land
10

11 Use Designation of the General Plan and Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan, and is not consistent
with the Scenic Highway Overlay."
NNVW 29 NOCINIIOONI MIOHITI 12 49. The Site lies within the boundaries of the Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan, which

8 A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION 13 designates it as Rural Residential. The Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan states that commercial commercial sites and "shall not be allowed in any 14 facilities are only allowed in existing
15 residential category in this plan."

16 50.

17 In addition, the Project Site lies within the Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan's
Scenic Highway Overlay, in which the plan explicitly prohibits commercial land uses.
18 "Neighborhood Commercial sites will not be allowed within the scenic highway corridor."

19 51.

20 Further, the Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan implements the County's General

21 Plan within the Project area, pursuant to state law: "After the. legislative body has adopted a
general plan, the planning agency may, or if so directed by the legislative body, shall, prepare
22 specific plans for the systematic implementation of the general plan for all or part of the area

23 covered by the general cop plan." (Gov. Code § 65450.) The County's General Plan explicitly
24 makes the implementing Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan mandatory:

25

26 "TRANSITION AREAS FOR RURAL COMMUNITIES

27 New development within the Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan

28 planning area shall be rural in character and shall comply with the

-12-
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 policies of that plan in order to maintain a buffer between urban
development and the Cleveland National Forest."
3 (Orange County General Plan, Growth Management Element, Policy 6.) Thus, the Project's 2

4 inconsistency with the Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan constitutes inconsistency with the
5 General Plan and Respondents violated the PZL by approving the Project.

6 D. VIOLATION OF THE COUNTY'S ZONING ORDINANCE

52. "To obtain a use permit, the applicant must generally show that the contemplated
8 use is compatible with the policies in terms of the zoning ordinances, and that such use would
be essential or desirable to the public convenience or welfare, and will not impair the integrity
10 and of the zone district or be detrimental to the public health, safety, morals or welfare."
11 (O'Hagen v. Board of Zoning Adjustment (1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 151.)
12 53. In determining whether the Project was consistent with the County's Zoning Code, NNVW 13 County planning staff found the Project inconsistent in three significant ways:
•è NOLIVHOdOO TVNOISSHJONd V 14 "Zoning Code Consistency Analysis NOCNHIOOW IIOHIIT 15 The subject site is located within the A1 "General Agricultural" zone; the
16 Codified Ordinances of Orange County define the purpose and intent of the A1
17 Zone District as:

18 The Al District is established to provide for agriculture, outdoor
19 recreational uses, and those low-intensity uses which have a

:20 predominately open space character. It is also intended that this
21 district may be used as an interim zone in those areas which the

22 General Plan may designate for more intensive urban uses in the

23 future. Source: Zoning Code Section 7-9-55.1
24 Inconsistency with the Purpose and Intent of the "A1" Zoning District

25 The proposed use is not consistent with the Purpose and Intent of the "A1" Zoning
26 District. Agricultural uses, outdoor recreational uses, and low-intensity uses
27 which have a predominately open space character are intended uses of this zone.
28 The use as proposed (i.e. weddings, large events) does not promote agriculture as
-13-
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

a significant function of the property, is not typically associated with an outdoor
2 recreational use as defined in the Zoning Code or Silverado-Modjeska Specific
Plan, and is a high-intensity use as it relates to traffic and noise generation.

4 Inconsistency with the Permitted Uses of the "A1" Zoning District The proposed

5 use is not consistent with the Permitted Uses of the "A1" Zoning District. The

6 most similar permitted use would be "Commercial Outdoor Recreation", which

7 is defined as providing "amusement, pleasure, or sport" for purposes of financial

8 gain. As proposed, the use is not typically associated with recreational outdoor use
9 and is not an activity that furthers the enjoyment of the natural surroundings.
10 Additionally, the use does not operate in the fashion where the event facility is
11 ancillary use to the primary permitted use such as agriculture.
NNVI 29 NOCNIIOOW IIOHIHT 12 Inconsistency with the Commercial Outdoor Recreation Zoning Definition
A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION 13 The proposed use is not consistent with the definition of "Commercial Outdoor

14 Recreation" Again, the proposed use is not typically associated with
15 "amusement, pleasure, or sport". Furthermore, restaurants, night clubs, and

16 cocktail lounges are discouraged under this definition. Food service/catering,

17 dancing, and alcohol service are all functions of weddings and similar events,

18 thus, the proposed use does not meet the definition of Commercial Outdoor

19 Recreation.

20 Summary

21 The proposed Red Rock Wedding Gardens is not consistent with the purpose and
22 intent of the "A1" Zoning District, is not consistent with the permitted uses of the

23 "A1" Zoning District, and is not consistent with the definition of Commercial
24 Outdoor Recreation."

25 54. County planning staff also compared the Project to on previously approved

26 Giracci Vineyards-and found the two readily distinguishable, with the Project being located

27 in the 1A Rural Residential zone, and Giracci Vineyards located in the 1B Suburban Residential

28 zone.

-14-
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

55; Section 65860 of PZL requires all zoning to be consistent with the adopted general
2 plan. Thus, by finding the Project was consistent with the County's Zoning Code and approving
3 it, Respondents violated the PZL and the Zoning Code and improperly granted the Project a
4 de facto zoning variance.

5 E. VIOLATION OF CEQA AND THE CEQA GUIDELINES

6 56. CEQA applies to all "governmental agencies at all levels" and requires public
7 agencies to prepare an EIR whenever the approval of a project may cause significant adverse
8 effects or impacts on the environment. Respondents' decision to approve the Project was a
9 project approval causing significant adverse environmental impacts.
10 57. CEQA requires lead agencies to review the environmental impacts of all projects.
11 Under Public Resources Code Section 21065, a project is any discretionary public "activity a

& LEIBOLD McCLENDON NNVW 2 12 which may cause either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable
NOLLVHOdHOO TVNOISSIION V 13 indirect physical change in the environment." Respondents' decision to approve the Project was
14 a discretionary decision by Respondent that will result in "reasonably foreseeable" adverse
15 environmental impacts.
16 58. A "significant effect on the environment" means a substantial, or potentially
17 substantial, adverse change in any of the physical conditions within the area affected by the
18 project including land, air, water, minerals, flora, fauna, ambient noise, and objects of historic
19 or aesthetic significance. The Project's potential impact to the community required the
20 preparation of an EIR. For example, Respondents approved the Project despite being presented
21 with expert opinion and substantial evidence from their own planning staff that the Project was
22 inconsistent with the County's General Plan, the Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan, and the
23| Zoning Code, as well as fair arguments supported by substantial evidence that the Project would
24 lead to environmental impacts that would not be mitigated to a level of insignificance. Thus,
25 subdivision (g) of CEQA Guidelines section 15064, required the preparation of an EIR.
26 59. In order for an EIR to be legally adequate, it must comport with certain
27 requirements set forth in CEQA and the Guidelines. For example, CEQA and the CEQA
28| Guidelines require that an EIR include a description of the Project and a discussion of
-15-
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

alternatives to the Project, including (but not limited to) the. "no project" alternative and
2 alternative methods of accomplishing some, but perhaps not all, of the proposed Project's

3 objectives. However, Respondents did not proceed in the manner required by law in that it failed

4 to cause an EIR to be prepared that adequately discussed a reasonable range of alternatives to
the proposed Project, thereby eliminating a meaningful basis for comparing the adverse
environmental impacts of the proposed Project to environmentally superior alternatives.
60. Respondent further did not proceed in the manner required by law in that it caused
a MND to be produced that was biased in favor of the proposed Project's approval and,
9 therefore, failed to constitute the full disclosure document intended to objectively inform

10 decision-makers and the public of the Project's true impacts, mitigation measures, and
11| alternatives. For example, the MND failed to honestly address basic deficiencies in the Initial
NNVN 2 NOINIIOON TIOHIFT 12 Study's Land Use analysis and further concerns including: Traffic and Traffic Safety Impacts;
A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION 13 Noise Impacts; Impacts on Air, Water Quality and Wildlife; and Exposure to Hazardous
14 Materials and Fire Hazard.

15 61. Respondents further did not proceed in the manner required by law in that their
16 finding that the MND satisfied the requirements mandated by CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines

17 constitutes an abuse of discretion in that Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required

18 by law and their decision is not supported by substantial evidence.

19 62. CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines require that the lead agency make certain written

20 findings and that those findings must be supported by substantial evidence in the record.
21 Respondents did not proceed in the manner required by law, however, because in connection
22 with the Board's approval of the Project's land use entitlement-a use permit-neither the

23 County's Planning Commission nor the Board adopted findings that refuted fair arguments
24 supported by substantial evidence that the Project was inconsistent with every applicable County

25 land use plan and zoning code and thus result in potentially significant environmental impacts.
26 63. CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines require that Respondents adopt feasible
27 mitigation measures to avoid significant environmental impacts. Respondents did not proceed

28 in the manner required by law in that the MND failed to adequately examine and discuss
-16-
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

potential mitigation measures that would substantially lessen the Project's reasonably foreseeable
2 adverse impacts to the surrounding community.
3 64. CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines require that Respondents analyze (among other
4 impacts) the Project's Traffic and Traffic Safety Impacts; Noise Impacts; Impacts on Air, Water
5 Quality and Wildlife; and Exposure to Hazardous Materials and Fire Hazard. Respondents were
6 provided with fair arguments supported by substantial evidence that the above impacts were not
7 fully mitigated. Nevertheless, Respondents approved the insufficient MND.

8 65. Respondents also violated CEQA's tequirements by failing to consider the
9 Project's cumulative impacts.
10 F. PROPRIETY OF RELIEF

11 66. The decision of Respondents to approve the Project and adopt the MND
12 NNVW constitutes a final decision as contemplated in Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and an
13 "approval" as defined in CEQA Guidelines section 15352.
8 NOLIVAOdHOO IVNOISSHIONd V 14 67. Respondents have the legal duty in making their determinations to comply with NOINHIDOW CIOHIIT 15 the applicable laws and regulations governing such acts. In particular, Respondents have the
16 legal and nondiscretionary duty to act in accordance with the requirements of CEQA, the CEQA
17 Guidelines, the PZL, County plans and ordinances, and other applicable laws and regulations.
18 68. Respondents acted arbitrarily, capriciously, irrationally, and unreasonably, and
without any or an adequate evidentiary basis in failing or refusing to comply with the
20 requirements of CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, the PZL, County plans and ordinances, and other 19

21 applicable laws and regulations.

22 69. At all times material hereto, Respondents had, and continue to have, the ability to
23 comply with their legal duties and obligations: Respondents have failed and refused to perform
24 those duties and obligations notwithstanding the substantial evidence presented by Petitioner and
25 others that such failures and refusals are contrary to law and regulations and will have adverse
26 consequences on Petitioner, its members, and those residing in the surrounding community.

3 In acting and iling to act in the manner described above, Respondents have
prejudicially abused their discretion by approving a legally inadequate MND and approving the
Project, in violation of Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 et seq.
71. Petitioner has exhausted all available administrative remedies against
Respondents' decision to approve the MND and approve the Project. There is no provision

8 known to Petitioner for any further administrative remedial action from the decision of
Respondents to approve the MND and approve the Project.
72.

9 for hereafter and has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law other than the relief sought in

10 Petitioner is beneficially interested in issuance of the writ of mandate as prayed

A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION 11 irreparable injury for which it has no adequate remedy at law, there will be a waste, and the

13 failure to enjoin further conduct may tend to render the judgment in this action ineffectual.
73.

15 Petitioner has commenced this action within the requisite time after the notice
14 authorized by Public Resources Code section 21152 was filed, as required by Public Resources
Code Section 21167, and within the period of time otherwise prescribed for the commencement
16 of this action in Government Code section 65009.

17 74. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
18 21167.5 by sending, via the United States Postal Service, written notice of this action to

19

20

21 Respondents. A copy of the written notice provided to Respondents was attached to the Petition
as Exhibit 3 and is incorporated therein by reference.
75. Petitioner will cause conformed copy of this Verified First Amended Petition for
22 Writ of Mandate to be served on the Attorney General in accordance with Public Resources Code
23 section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388.

5 fully comply with CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, the PZL, and/or other
applicable laws and regulations;
2. For reasonable attorneys' fees in addition to any other relief granted; 00 3. For cost of suit incurred herein and for reasonable lftigation expenses; and
