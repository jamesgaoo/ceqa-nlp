INTRODUCTION

1. By this action, Petitioner Santa Cruz County Greenway challenges
the June 14, 2018 approval by the Santa Cruz County Regional Transportation
4 Commission ("Commission") of a project to enter into an Administration,
5 Coordination, and License Agreement ("Project") with Progressive Rail
6 Incorporated (dba St. Paul & Pacific Railroad Company, LLC or Santa Cruz
7 Scenic Railway, LLC) for expansion of freight service on the Santa Cruz
8 Branch Railroad Line, without complying with the California Environmental
Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq. On June
10 15, 2018, the Commission filed a "Notice of Exemption" under CEQA, claiming
11 both categorical and statutory exemptions for the Project.
12 2. The key purpose of this Project is to expand freight service on the
13 Santa Cruz Branch Line ("Line"), an approximately 31-mile railroad line that
14 traverses the length of Santa Cruz County, from Watsonville to Davenport.
15 This expansion would require extensive construction in sensitive ecological
16 habitats and would bring noisy, polluting, and potentially dangerous freight
17 trains within 100 feet of hundreds, if not thousands, of homes. It may also
18 preclude alternate uses of this important transportation corridor, despite an
19 ongoing Commission effort to study such uses with sales tax funds specially
20 designated by the voters.

21 3. Prior to approving the Project, the Commission did not evaluate
22 the environmental consequences of its proposed action or examine any
23 potential alternatives or mitigation measures available to reduce its
24 significant and adverse environmental effects. Nor did the Commission
25 provide the public with any opportunity to understand and comment on such
26 impacts. Rather, the Commission determined that the Project did not need to
27 be studied under CEQA at all.

28 2
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate
Case No.

4. This approach violates fundamental CEQA principles of informing
2 both the decisionmaker and the public of potential environmental
3 consequences before a public agency takes any discretionary action that may
4 significantly impact the environment. It also allows the Project to move
5 forward without adequate consideration of potential mechanisms to reduce
6 noise, pollution, habitat degradation, and other impacts-or of alternative

7 solutions to avoid these impacts entirely.
5. Because the Commission's approval of the Project violates CEQA,
the Project must be set aside and activities to implement it must be
10 suspended.

11 PARTIES

12 6. Petitioner Santa Cruz County Greenway is a 501(c)(4)
13 organization whose mission is to create a spectacular greenway as the
14 backbone of a safe, scenic, and efficient active transportation network from
15 Davenport to Watsonville. In addition to supporting a future active
16 transportation network with a functional bicycle and pedestrian path,
17 Greenway's members seek to ensure that any use of the Line is compatible
18 with the surrounding neighborhoods and consistent with applicable law. In
19 particular, they seek to ensure that any such use includes measures that
20 mitigate the Project's environmental impacts to the maximum extent feasible,
21 as required by CEQA. Members of Greenway include residents and taxpayers
22 of Santa Cruz County who will be negatively affected by the Project's adverse
23 environmental impacts. The interests that Greenway seeks to further in this
24 action are within the purposes and goals of the organization.
25 7. Greenway and its members specifically objected to the
26 Commission's decision to enter into the Administration, Coordination, and
27 License Agreement with Progressive Rail Incorporated ("Progressive Rail") or
28| its subsidiaries without complying with CEQA, including failing to evaluate
3
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate
Case No.

1 the environmental consequences of such an action prior to the Commission's
2 approval.

3 8. Greenway and its members have a direct beneficial interest in the

4 Commission's compliance with CEQA. This interest will be directly and
5 adversely affected by the Project, which would cause substantial and
6 irreversible harm to the environment and approval of which violated
7 provisions of law as set forth in this Petition.

8 9. The maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a
9 substantial benefit on the public by protecting the public from the
10 environmental and other harms alleged herein and by ensuring that the
11 Commission abides by the procedures required by law in approving
12 agreements like the one at issue here.

13 10. Respondent Santa Cruz County Regional Transportation
14 Commission is a public agency organized and existing under and by virtue of
15 the laws of the State of California and is located in Santa Cruz County. The
16 Commission is the CEQA "lead agency" for the Project and is responsible for
17 implementing and complying with the provisions of CEQA. The Commission
18 approved the Administration, Coordination, and License Agreement on June
19 14, 2018 and authorized the CEQA Notice of Exemption, which was filed on
20 June 15, 2018. The Notice of Exemption lists the Santa Cruz County Regional
21 Transportation Commission as the "public agency approving project" and as
22 the "person or agency carrying out the project."

23 11. Petitioner is informed, and on that basis alleges, that Real Party
24 in Interest Progressive Rail a Incorporated is a business corporation
25 incorporated in Minnesota. Progressive Rail submitted a proposal in response
26 to the Commission's request for proposals for a new operator of the Line and,
27 on or about January 18, 2018, the Commission determined that it would seek
28 to enter an administration, coordination, and license agreement with
4
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate
Case No.

1 Progressive Rail for such service. Representatives of Progressive Rail appeared

2 at the Commission's January 18, April 19, and June 14, 2018 meetings to
3 answer questions about the proposal. Petitioner is informed, and on that basis

4 alleges, that Progressive Rail has formed or is intending to form a subsidiary
5 (either St. Paul & Pacific Railroad Company, LLC or Santa Cruz Scenic
6 Railway, LLC) to sign the approved Administration, Coordination, and License
7 Agreement and to operate on the Line pursuant to that Agreement. Petitioner
8 is informed, and on that basis alleges, that Progressive Rail has not obtained a

9 certificate of qualification from the California Secretary of State.
10 12. Petitioner is informed, and on that basis alleges, that on or about
11 July 16, 2018, Real Party in Interest St. Paul & Pacific Railroad Company,
12 LLC filed a Verified Notice of Exemption with the Surface Transportation
13 Board to assume operation of the Line as a common carrier. The Verified
14 Notice of Exemption states that St. Paul & Pacific Railroad Company, LLC is a
15 subsidiary of Progressive Rail and that St. Paul & Pacific Railroad Company,
16 LLC will enter into the Administration, Coordination, and License Agreement
17 approved by the Commission on June 14, 2018. Petitioner is informed, and on
18 that basis alleges, that St. Paul & Pacific Railroad Company, LLC is a Limited
19 Liability Company incorporated in Minnesota. Petitioner is informed, and on
20 that basis alleges, that St. Paul & Pacific Railroad Company, LLC has not
21 obtained a certificate of qualification from the California Secretary of State.
22 13. Real Party in Interest Santa Cruz Scenic Railway, LLC is listed as
23 a contracting party in the Administration, Coordination, and License
24 Agreement approved by the Commission on June 14, 2018. Petitioner is
25 informed, and on that basis alleges, that Santa Cruz Scenic Railway, LLC is
26 registered, as a reserved business name, with the Minnesota Secretary of
27 State but has not yet been formed as a Limited Liability Company. Petitioner
28 is informed, and on that basis alleges, that Santa Cruz Scenic Railway, LLC
5
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate
Case No.

has not obtained a certificate of qualification from the California Secretary of
2 State. Petitioner is informed, and on that basis alleges, that Santa Cruz Scenic
3 Railway, LLC is not included in any Notice of Exemption currently on file with
4 the Surface Transportation Board for the Line. Nevertheless, Petitioner
5 includes Santa Cruz Scenic Railway, LLC as a Real Party in Interest in an
6 abundance of caution, based on its inclusion in the Administration,
7 Coordination, and License Agreement approved by the Commission.

8 14. Petitioner does not know the true names and capacities, whether
9 individual, corporate, associate or otherwise, of Real Parties in Interest Doe 1
10 through Doe 10, inclusive, and therefore sues said Real Parties in Interest
11 under fictional names. Petitioner is informed, and on that basis alleges, that
12 each fictionally named Real Party in Interest is responsible in some manner
13 for committing the acts upon which this action is based or has material
14 interests affected by the Project or by the Commission's actions with respect to
15 this Project. Petitioner will amend this Petition to show their true names and
16 capacities if and when the same have been ascertained.
17 STATEMENT OF FACTS

18 15. The Santa Cruz Branch Railroad Line runs over 31 miles across
19 Santa Cruz County from Watsonville to Davenport. Much of the Line is now in
20 a state of disrepair and disuse. Storms and flooding during the 2016/2017
21 rainy season severely damaged significant portions of the Line. As a result,
22 only around 3 miles of the Line in Watsonville are currently operational for
23 freight. Petitioner is informed, and on that basis alleges, that at the time of
24 the Commission's consideration of the Administration, Coordination, and
25 License Agreement, all freight activity on the Line had ceased.

26 16. Until 2012, Union Pacific owned the Line and either operated
27 trains directly or engaged third-party operators. However, after much study
28 and negotiation, the Commission purchased the Line from Union Pacific,
6
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate
Case No.

1 stating the Commission's intent to preserve the rail corridor for "future uses
2 by the public at large." In its environmental review of that acquisition, the
3 Commission promised the public that future use of the Line would be "subject
4 to separate environmental review."

5 17. As part of the purchase from Union Pacific, the Commission
6 engaged lowa Pacific, a short-line railroad operator, to take over operation of
7 the Line. Specifically, in or around 2012, Iowa Pacific entered into an
8 administration, coordination, and license agreement with the Commission,

9 assumed ownership of a "freight easement" on the railroad right of way, and
10 sought common carrier designation from the Surface Transportation Board.
11 Petitioner is informed, and on that basis alleges, that since 2012, Iowa Pacific
12 has operated a modest number of freight trains (approximately 350 carloads
13 per year on the first three miles of track), and, between 2012 and 2016,
14 seasonal tourist trains.

15 18. Despite its agreement with Iowa Pacific allowing freight service,
16 the Commission promised the public that it would continue to study other
17 future uses of the rail corridor. In 2016, Santa Cruz County voters approved
18 Measure D, a sales tax measure addressing improvements to transportation
19 infrastructure in Santa Cruz County. As part of Measure D, the voters
20 approved an expenditure plan, which established how the Commission could
21 spend the revenue generated by the new sales tax. The expenditure plan
22 included funding for an environmental and economic analysis of "possible
23 future transit and other transportation uses of the corridor through an open,
24 transparent public process." The Commission is currently undertaking the
25 Unified Corridor Investment Study to fulfill this promised analysis. Petitioner
26 is informed, and on that basis alleges, that the Commission intends to
27 complete the Study in late 2018 or early 2019.
28
7
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate
Case No.

1 19. Petitioner is informed, and on that basis alleges, that beginning in
2 or around 2016, Iowa Pacific failed to meet some of its obligations pursuant to
3 the administration, coordination, and license agreement with the Commission.
4 On November 2, 2017, the Commission sent Iowa a Pacific a 30-day notice of
5 default, indicating that the Commission would terminate the agreement and

6 require Iowa Pacific to initiate abandonment proceedings at the Surface
7 Transportation Board.

8 20. Instead, Iowa Pacific suggested that the Commission find another
9 operator. The Commission then quickly put together a Request for Proposals,
10 which it issued on or about December 8, 2017, requesting responses by
11 January 4, 2018.

12 21. Five entities, including Progressive Rail, submitted responses. In
13 Progressive Rail's materials, the company highlighted its experience with and
14 commitment to expanding freight service. Among other statements:
15 a. Progressive Rail identified five potential freight customers
16 with traffic totaling over 1,500 annual carloads and requiring use of at least 13
17 miles of track.

18 b. Progressive Rail asserted it would increase freight
19 operations to at least 3,000 carloads in the first five years of any agreement
20 with the Commission.

21 C. Progressive Rail touted its successful business model of
22 convincing its existing customers to expand operations along newly acquired or
23 licensed rail corridors.

24 d. Progressive Rail explained its efforts to acquire both a
25 propane distribution facility site and a transloading warehouse to increase
26 operations.
27 22. On or about January 18, 2018, the Commission decided to continue
28 exclusive negotiations with Progressive Rail. In reaching this decision, the
8
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate
Case No.

Commission noted Progressive Rail's experience with expanding freight
2 service in other areas and recognized the company's intent to accomplish a
3 similar expansion of service in Santa Cruz County.

4 23. Between January and May 2018, Greenway urged the Commission
5 to slow down negotiations with Progressive Rail so that the agency and the
6 public could better understand the impacts of engaging a new operator for the
7 Line. Specifically, on April 18, 2018, Greenway sent a letter to the Commission
8 raising the concern that the Commission appeared close to reaching an
9 agreement with Progressive Rail without having conducted any environmental
10 review. The letter outlined why the proposed agreement did not qualify for a
11 categorical exemption under CEQA and why federal law did not preempt
12 CEQA review for this Project. Greenway requested that the Commission pause
13 negotiations and conduct the environmental review required by state law.
14 24. The Commission did not heed Greenway's request. Instead, on
15 May 9, 2018, the Commission released for public review a draft
16 administration, coordination, and license agreement with a Progressive Rail
17 subsidiary, The proposed 10-year agreement would permit the subsidiary to
18 operate unlimited freight service on the entire Line in exchange for license
19 fees paid to the Commission. It also would obligate the Commission to fund
20 extensive construction to fully repair the Line. Commission staff estimated
21 that the first phase of construction alone would cost $2 or 3 million.
22 25. The proposed administration, coordination, and license agreement
23 provided that Iowa Pacific would convey its freight easement to the
24 Progressive Rail subsidiary, in part to allow the subsidiary to obtain common
25 carrier designation for the Line with the Surface Transportation Board. The
26 agreement also stated that the Commission may take no action that
27 "materially conflict[s]" with any freight service on the Line.
28
9
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate
Case No.

26. The proposed agreement purported to allow the Commission to
2 cancel the agreement if the Commission determines, after completion of the
3 Unified Corridor Investment Study, that the easternmost seven miles of line
4 "should not be used for freight service." However, the agreement stated that
5 this cancellation right is subordinate to the rights and obligations of
6 Progressive Rail's subsidiary to provide freight service under federal law.
27. Greenway carefully reviewed the proposed administration,
coordination, and license agreement, and submitted additional comments on
9 June 8, 2018. Again, Greenway raised concerns that the Commission was
10 improperly relying on false claims of categorical exemptions under CEQA and
11 federal preemption. Specifically, Greenway warned that:

12 a. Progressive Rail's commitment to expand freight service
13 along the corridor made the Class 1 (Existing Facilities) and Class 2
14 (Replacement and Reconstruction) CEQA exemptions wholly inapplicable.
15 b. The California Supreme Court had recently held that the
16 federal Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995 ("ICCTA")
17 does not preempt the application of CEQA to a decision undertaken by a
18 California public entity, like the Commission, to expand freight service on a
19 publicly owned line. Friends of the Eel River v. North County Rail Authority
20 (2017) 3 Cal.5th 677.

21 28. Greenway's letter of June 8, 2018 also presented extensive
22 evidence of the significant environmental consequences of any approval of the
23 proposed administration, coordination, and license agreement. Such
24 significant impacts, especially when caused by unusual circumstances, render
25 the categorical exemptions inapplicable. In particular, Greenway raised
26 concerns about the following Project impacts, among others:
27

28
10
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate
Case No.

a. Noise and vibration impacts, including from train horns, to
2 the hundreds or thousands of homes, schools, daycares, and other sensitive
3 receptors within 100 feet of the Line;

4 b. Public health impacts associated with increased exposure to
5 diesel particulate matter and other pollution from Progressive Rail's older,

6 diesel locomotives;

C. Public safety concerns associated with the Line's dozens of
8 at-grade street crossings and with the increased freight traffic adjacent to both
9 formal and informal recreational uses along the existing corridor;
10 d. Visual impacts associated with tank storage, laydown space
11 and graffiti; and
12 e. Construction impacts associated with the millions of dollars
13 of work necessary to bring the tracks into good working order, including the
14 impacts of repairing significant damage adjacent to Harkins Slough and in
15l other wetlands and sensitive habitats.

16 29. On June 13, 2018, Commission staff responded to Greenway's
17 letter. While staff disagreed with Greenway's position regarding the claimed
18 CEQA exemptions and federal preemption, staff did not respond to or rebut
19 Greenway's concerns about the proposed agreement's environmental impacts.
20 30. On June 14, 2018, the Commission considered the proposed
21 administration, coordination, and license agreement. At the meeting,
22 Commission staff informed the Commission that all activity on the Line had
23 ceased for several weeks due to Iowa Pacific's lack of maintenance. After
24 approximately three hours of public comment, in which the majority of the
25 speakers expressed significant concern about the proposed agreement, the
26 Commission voted 8-4 to adopt a minute order approving the Administration,
27 Coordination, and License Agreement that is the subject of this action; this
28 Agreement is nearly identical to the draft agreement circulated to the public,
11
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate
Case No.

with two minor changes. The Commission also approved a Notice of Exemption
2 for the Project.

3 31. On June 15, 2018, the Commission filed the Notice of Exemption
4 with Santa Cruz County. The Notice of Exemption asserts that:

5 a. The Project's freight operations are "not subject to CEQA

6 under the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act";
b. The Project's freight operations and construction activities
are categorically exempt under CEQA's Class 1 and Class 2 exemptions; and

C. The Project's initiation or increase of passenger rail service
10| is statutorily exempt under Public Resources Code section 21080(b)(10).
11 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

12 32. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this
13 Petition pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5 and
14 Public Resources Code sections 21168, 21168.5, and 21168.9.

15 33. Venue is proper in this Court because the causes of action alleged
16 in this Petition arose in Santa Cruz County, where the Commission is located,
17 the Project was approved, and the Project would be carried out.
18 34. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources
19 Code section 21167.5 by serving a written notice of Petitioner's intention to
20 commence this action on the Commission on July 18, 2018. Copies of this
21 written notice and proof of service are attached as Exhibit A to this Petition.

22 35. Petitioner is complying with the requirements of Public Resources
23 Code section 21167.6 by concurrently filing a notice concerning preparation of
24 the record of administrative proceedings relating to this action.
25 36. Petitioner is sending a copy of this Petition to the California
26 Attorney General concurrently with this filing, complying with the
27 requirements of Public Resources Code section 22167.7. A copy of this written
28 notice is attached as Exhibit B to this Petition.
12
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate
Case No.

37. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing
2 this instant action and has exhausted any and all available administrative
3 remedies to the extent required by law.

4 38. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course
5 of ordinary law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to

6 require the Commission to set aside its approval of the Project until it complies
7 with CEQA. In the absence of such remedies, the Commission's approval will
8 remain in effect in violation of state law.
9 CAUSE OF ACTION

10 (Violation of CEQA, Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.)
11 39. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1
12 through 38, inclusive, of this Petition, as if fully set forth below.

13 40. CEQA is designed to ensure that the long-term protection of the
14 environment is the guiding criterion in discretionary public decisions. CEQA
15 accomplishes its purpose by requiring public agencies to determine, and to
16 disclose to the public detailed information about, the effect that a proposed
17 project is likely to have on the environment; to list ways in which the effects of
18 the project might be avoided or minimized; and to develop and compare
19 alternatives to the project.
20 41. The Commission unlawfully determined that the Project was
21 categorically exempt from CEQA. First, the Commission stated that future
22 freight operations qualified as the "operation, .. . leasing, [or] licensing . . . of
23 existing public... facilities," citing Guidelines § 15301 (Class 1 Exemption).
24 However, the CEQA Guidelines clarify that this exemption applies only where
25 there is "negligible or no expansion of use beyond that existing at the time of
26 the lead agency's determination." Id. At the time of the approval of the Project
27 and issuance of the Notice of Exemption, Petitioner is informed, and on that
28 basis alleges, that there was no freight movement on the Line for at least a few
13
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate
Case No.

weeks. Because Progressive Rail's stated purpose in proposing the
2 Administration, Coordination, and License Agreement is to greatly expand
3 freight operations along the Line by increasing the number of carloads and

4 enlarging the operations' geographic scope, the Project does not qualify for the
5 Class 1 Exemption.
42. Second, the Commission claimed that the construction activities
7 promised by the Commission as part of the Administration, Coordination, and
8 License Agreement qualified as "replacement or reconstruction of existing

9 structures and facilities," citing Guidelines § 15302 (Class 2 Exemption).
10 Again, however, the CEQA Guidelines are clear that this exemption applies
11 only where the new structure will have "substantially the same purpose and
12 capacity as the structure replaced." Id. Because the negotiations between
13 Progressive Rail and the Commission contemplate increased freight service,
14 this exemption is likewise inapplicable.
15 43. No categorical exemption may be used where there is a reasonable
16 possibility that the project will cause a significant environmental effect due to
17 unusual circumstances. Guidelines § 15300.2(c). Here, unusual circumstances
18 related to both the Administration, Coordination, and License Agreement and
19 the associated construction projects create the reasonable possibility of
20 significant environmental harm. For instance, the location of necessary
21 construction activities in and adjacent to wetlands and other sensitive habitats

22 creates the reasonable possibility of significant harm to biological resources
23 during construction. Similarly, federal law will prevent local jurisdictions from
24 imposing noise controls or safety features on the operation of the Line,
a 25 creating a reasonable possibility of significant noise and public safety impacts.
26 Such reasonable possibilities of significant environmental impact due to
27 unusual circumstances render the Class 1 and Class 2 categorical exemptions
28 inapplicable to this Project.
14
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate
Case No.

44. Use of Class 1 and Class 2 exemptions is also improper where a
2 project is certain to result in significant adverse impacts. Berkeley Hillside
3 Preservation v. City of Berkeley (2015) 60 Cal.4th 1086, 1105 (certainty of

4 significant adverse impact is unusual circumstance rendering categorical
5 exemptions inapplicable). Here, the record is clear that the Project will have

6 significant adverse environmental impacts, including but not limited to noise
7 and vibration impacts, public health and air quality impacts, public safety
8 impacts, traffic impacts, and impacts to wetlands and protected species.
9 Accordingly, the Commission erred in relying on the Class 1 and Class 2
10 exemptions.

11 45. The Commission also erred in concluding that the Project's freight
12 operations are not subject to CEQA under the Interstate Commerce
13 Commission Termination Act. The California Supreme Court recently held
14 that the ICCTA does not preempt the application of CEQA to a decision
15 undertaken by a California public entity to expand freight service on a publicly
16 owned rail line. Here, the Commission owns the underlying right of way and
17 engaged in a discretionary decision about whether and with whom to enter an
18 administration, coordination, and license agreement to permit future freight
19 operation. The ICCTA does not allow the Commission to avoid compliance with
20 CEQA prior to making that decision.
21 46. In view of the foregoing violations of CEQA, the Commission's
22 approval of the Project must be set aside.

23 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

24 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as follows:
25 1. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing the
26 Commission to vacate and set aside its approval of the Project;
27

28
15

5 respondent, real parties in interest and their agents, employees, officers, and

7 full compliance with the requirements of CEQA;

8 4. For costs of the suit;

9 5. For attorneys' fees as authorized by Code of Civil Procedure
10 section 1021.5 and other provisions of law; and
