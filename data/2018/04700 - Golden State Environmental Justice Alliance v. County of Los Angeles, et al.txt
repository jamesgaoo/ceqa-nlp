22 and Planning Law (Gov. Code §§ 65000 et seq.), and California Public Resources Code section
23 21000 et seq., Golden State Environmental Justice Alliance ("GSEJA" or "Petitioner") sues on

25 Project (hereafter, "the Project"), to enforce the Zoning and Planning Law, the California
26 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), and the County's Hillside Management Areas Ordinance.
27 GSEJA alleges:
28
PETITION AND COMPLAINT (GOV. CODE,
CEQA, HILLSIDE MANAGEMENT ORD.) P

INTRODUCTION

2 1. This action challenges the approval by the Board of Supervisors of the County of

3 Los Angeles, with associated CEQA and planning documents, of the NorthLake Specific Plan

4 Project ("the Project"). The Project would involve the residential development of 3150 housing

5 units on 1,330 acres of sensitive land with several unique biological resources, in contravention

6 of CEQA, the State Zoning and Planning Law, and the County's own Hillside Management

7 Areas (*HMA") Ordinance.

8 2. Petitioner seeks to set aside these approvals:

9 a. The Board of Supervisors' denial of GSEJA's, the Santa Monica Mountains
10 Conservancy's, and the Center for Biological Diversity's appeals in connection with the Project,

11 b. The Board of Supervisors' approval of County Project No. R2015-00408-(5),

12 Vesting Tentative Tract Map No. TR-073335-(5), Conditional Use Permit No. 201500019-(5),

13 and the Supplemental Environmental Impact Report associated with Environmental Assessment
14 No. 201500030-(5);

15 C. The Board of Supervisors' approval authorizing the development of Phase

16 1 of the NorthLake Specific Plan of approximately 720 acres of the 1,330-acre Specific Plan

17 area, including 2,295 residential units, 38,700 sq ft of mixed-use community commercial use,
18 32,175 sq ft of highway commercial use, 799.5 acres of parks and open space, a 23-acre school

19 site, a 1.4-acre fire station site, and all associated infrastructure and utilities, located east of

20 Interstate 5, west of Castaic Lake, and north of the unincorporated community of Castaic in the

21 Castaic Canyon Zoned District;

22 d. Any and all motions purporting to adopt findings and certify an EIR for the
23 Project, including any Statement of Overriding Considerations and any Mitigation Monitoring

24 and Reporting Plan for the Project, including but not limited to the Regional Planning

25 Commission-prepared Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations Regarding
26 the NorthLake Specific Plan Project (State Clearinghouse No. 2015031080), as adopted by the

10 3.

11 On information and belief, a Notice of Determination for the Project was posted

12 on or about September 25, 2018, the date the Board of Supervisors took final action on the
Project.

13 4. The Board of Supervisors is the ultimate land-use authority and decision-making
14 body in the County of Los Angeles.

15 5.

16 In approving the Project, the County and Board of Supervisors violated provisions
of CEQA requiring that a lead agency fully assess and disclose significant impacts and that it
17 provide reliable mitigation subject to specific performance standards so a project's impacts will

18

19 be mitigated to the fullest extent feasible.

6.

20 They also approved development contrary to an existing Specific Plan for the site,

21 without amending that Specific Plan. This violated both the Zoning and Planning Law, and the
County's own HMA Ordinance, because the Ordinance prohibits grading of ridgelines unless
22 that grading is consistent with an existing specific plan, and this Project was not.

23 7.

24 But probably most concerning was the County's inadequate CEQA review

25 regarding biological resources onsite and downstream from the Project (since the Project

26 involves filling in a blue-line stream on which endangered species such as the least Bell's vireo

27 and the willow and southwestern willow flycatchers depend).

8.

28 For example, the County planned to "translocate" colonies of Western Spadefoot
toad by "creating" new wetland habitats for them, without even discussing the upland habitat
PETITION AND COMPLAINT (GOV. CODE,
CEQA, HILLSIDE MANAGEMENT ORD.) 3

1 requirements the toad had, without providing for adaptive management, and with only a five-

2 year period for monitoring thereafter, when that period of monitoring would not assure that the

3 wetlands were functioning, much less that the toads were surviving. Nor could the County point

4 to any actual projects where such translocation had worked. The only location for the toad that

5 the "Draft Spadefoot Relocation Plan," released not with the Draft EIR but only with the Final

6 EIR, identified was in habitat designated for the federally threatened Coastal California

7 gnatcatcher ("CAGN"), and was almost entirely lacking in the required grassland according to

8 the County's mapping of the site.? Finally, the Plan claimed to rely on Adaptive Management

9 but failed to set forth any standards, making the claim an empty promise.
10 9. The County planned on "translocating" large swaths of critically threatened plants

11 including the slender mariposa lily and club-haired mariposa lily similarly with no substantial

12 evidence of success in doing so, and in the face of evidence that such translocation efforts had

13 failed and had damaged the plant life in the translocation area.

14 10. Without exception, or perhaps almost without, exception, the County relied upon

15 faulty analysis and mitigation plans which it circulated not with the Draft Supplemental
16 Environmental Impact Report (*DSEIR"), but with the Final Supplemental Environmental

17 Impact Report ("FSEIR"), on which the public was not invited to comment. This violates the

18 central purposes of CEQA.

19 11. The County failed to find significant impacts to biological resources and to
20 greenhouse gases despite substantial evidence in the record that such impacts would occur, it

21 failed to adopt several feasible mitigation measures identified by state and regional agencies and
22 members of the public, and it adopted Statement of Overriding Considerations which was not
23  based on substantial evidence.

24
25 As one commenter noted, studies of created wetlands have shown that only 20% or less
26 function as intended. Moreover, the DEIR did not evaluate impacts to biota at the receiving site for the Spadefoot Relocation Plan.

27 2 It should also be noted that actual areas where CAGN had been documented to be present on the Project site were planned to be plowed over for development, so the County and the
28 developer could only hope that it would move to a small corner of the site adjacent to development, where they also planned to place the Spadefoot toad.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2 12. This Court has jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and
1094.5. The Court has jurisdiction of CEQA matters under Pub. Resources Code sections 21168,

4 21168.5, and 21168.9.

5 13. Venue is proper in this Court because the County of Los Angeles and the

6 proposed Project are in Los Angeles County, so the actions giving rise to the causes of action

7 herein transpired in Los Angeles County. See Code of Civil Procedure sections 393 and 394.

8 14. This action is timely filed within 30 days of the posting of the Notice of

9 Determination under CEQA on or after September 25, 2018.

10 15. Petitioner has exhausted its administrative remedies by commenting on the

11 Project prior to the close of the public hearing on the Project before the filing of the applicable
12 Notice of Determination, in compliance with Public Resources Code section 21177(b).

13 16. Petitioner has complied with CEQA by filing and serving prior to this Petition for
14 Writ of Mandate a Notice of Intent to File under Pub. Resources Code section 21167.5, a true

15 and correct copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A, by complying with Pub. Resources
16 Code section 21167.6 in notifying the County of Petitioner's election to prepare the
17 administrative record (a true and correct copy of which is filed contemporaneously), and in

21 STATEMENT OF FACTS AND COMMON ALLEGATIONS

22 24.

23 The Project Site and Proposed Project. The Project site comprises 1330 acres in
rural northern Los Angeles County, east of Interstate 5, west of Castaic Lake, and north of the
24 community of Castaic. The Project site was the subject of a Specific Plan adopted in 1992. Only
25 the County considers the environmental review conducted for that Specific Plan over 25 years

26

27 ago to still be relevant today. Only the County would justify the proposed development ("the

28 Project") on the ground it involved somewhat less development than that originally envisioned in

PETITION AND COMPLAINT (GOV. CODE,
CEQA, HILLSIDE MANAGEMENT ORD.) 6

T the Specific Plan.3 The Project involves the development of 3,150 residential units on the 1330

2 acres; in violation of CEQA's proscription of "segmentation," the Project divided the site into a

3 "Phase I" and a "Phase II;" a vesting tentative tract map (*VTTM") was sought only for Phase I,
4 covering 720 acres. The Project studied in the DEIR involved developing 1974 dwelling units

5 on the 720-acre Phase I parcel, and industrial and commercial uses, until the Planning
Commission urged the developer to add 323 additional housing units (including 315 affordable
7 housing units) for a total of 2297 units to replace the industrial and most of the commercial

8 development. The Project as approved involved this higher number of units, although there was

9 no evaluation of this change in the DEIR or FEIR.4
10 25. Importance of the Project Site. The Project site contains a major canyon,

11 Grasshopper Canyon, and a blue-line stream, which drains into Castaic Lagoon to the south. It is
12 immediately adjacent to the Castaio State Recreation Area ("Castaic SRA"). Development

13 would extend the suburban limit over three miles into public open space, would involve 33

14 million cubic yards of grading, and the filling in of the blue-line stream. The applicant claimed

15 these actions and the mass paving that would follow would not have significant impacts on the
16 endangered and threatened species on the site and would not affect the endangered species
17 downstream. The California Department of Parks and Recreation (*DPR"), the California

18 Department of Fish & Wildlife ("CDFW"),5 and the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy

19 ("SMMC"), and the Center for Biological Diversity ("CBD") and Petitioner, supported by a

20 3 For this reason, the County referred to the Draft Environmental Impact Report ("DEIR") as a
21 Draft "Supplemental" Environmental Impact Report ("DSEIR"), and the Final a Environmental Impact Report ("FEIR") as a Final "Supplemental" Environmental Impact
22 Report ("FSEIR"). Because Petitioner does not believe tiering on the 26-year-old 1992 Specific Plan EIR was valid, Petitioner refers to the documents at issue here as the DEIR and
23 the FEIR. As the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy made clear, the County's contention that the developer had enforceable entitlements due to the 1992 EIR process was simply a
24 "myth."

25 County staff claimed there was an "Errata" to the DEIR showing that this change to Phase I had no impacts on, e.g., traffic, air quality or greenhouse gases, but this document was not
26 made available with the materials transmitted to the County Board of Supervisors. The absence of this document requires recirculation.
27 5 DPR and CDFW would both be "responsible agencies" under CEQA with respect to this Project.

CEQA, HILLSIDE MANAGEMENT ORD.) 7

F Ph.D. biologist with over 28 years of experience who is the author of at least 80 peer-reviewed

2 publications, disagreed. There was no substantial evidence to support the County's conclusions
3 of no significant impacts.5

4 26. Inadequate Assessment of Risks from the Oil Pipeline; Need for Recirculation.
5 The Project site, although largely pristine, is traversed by an active oil pipeline. In the DEIR, the

6 County proposed to relocate that pipeline onto DPR land. Not surprisingly at all, DPR refused

7 the proposal in no uncertain terms, and not until the release of the FEIR did the County release a

8 new planned alignment placing the pipeline along the edge of the Castaic SRA. The threats

9 posed by the new alignment were entirely unevaluated and the proposal constituted significant

10 new information requiring recirculation of the DEIR.

11 27. Inadequate Assessment of Edge Effects; Need for Recirculation. The DEIR and

12 FEIR did not adequately evaluate the impacts on the thin layer of open space planned to surround

13 the development. The developer's Conceptual Plan included in the FSEIR Appendices
14 acknowledging that ecological values would be extremely limited in this strip of "habitat" of 600

15 feet or less in width was significant new information and should have prompted recirculation of
16 the DEIR. Further, the planned use of this strip for mitigation was insufficient under CEQA's

17 standards. Finally, the County did not properly assess impacts from predictable "edge effects"

18 such as light spillage onto natural habitat, humans and domestic animals entering into such
19 habitat, and roadkill of common and special status species because of development on the site.

20 28. Inadequate Assessment of Site's Function as a Wildlife Corridor; Need for

21 Recirculation. The DEIR and FEIR failed to adequately assess the site's use as a wildlife
22 corridor, despite comments from CDFW, SMMC, and Petitioner's expert that it would serve

23 such a role. The County's failure to assess the site for its value in this regard represented a

24 failure to proceed by law and its bare conclusion that the site did not represent such a corridor

25 was not supported by substantial evidence. Among other things, Petitioner's expert suggested
26 that the County conduct trappings or automated photographic analysis to confirm that it did not

-

2 serve as such a corridor, but the County failed to do so. Further, he noted that the site would be

3 used as a corridor by multiple volant species, and its role in this regard had not been assessed,

29.

4 Inadequate Evaluation of Impacts to Western Spadefoot; Need for Recirculation.

5 The Project represents a disaster for the numerous colonies of Western Spadefoot toad on the

6 site. CDFW commented that the DEIR had significant inconsistencies in its discussion of where

7 the Spadefoot was present on the site, and that it was not clear how moving the toad within the

8 development was feasible given that the toad has an average home range of 1355 feet from its

9 breeding pool. The County claimed that its surveys disclosing locations of the toad were
adequate despite the inconsistencies CDFW noted, because there would be another focused
10 survey done later. This does not comply with CEQA, which requires that the public be informed

11 of the extent of damage to the environment before a project is approved. The County further
12 released a "Draft Spadefoot Relocation Plan" with its FEIR, but this document disclosed that one

13 of only two proposed sites for relocation onsite was well within 1355 feet of development, and
14 though the County claimed in the FEIR it could relocate the Spadefoot offsite, the viability of

15 this option was not discussed in the Relocation Plan. The Relocation Plan constituted significant
16 new information under CEQA. The Relocation Plan did not contain specific performance
17 measures and was improper deferral under CEQA. The Relocation Plan's commitment to only

18

19 five years of monitoring was insufficient to support a conclusion that impacts would be mitigated
to less than significant levels.

20 30.

21 Inadequate Assessment as to Vernal Pools; Need for Recirculation. The DEIR

22 failed to assess impacts to vernal pools, eight of which the County originally acknowledged were

23 present on the site. As CDFW noted, eliminating those vernal pools was a significant impact.

24 Although the County tried to backtrack and claim that these depressions were not vernal pools,

25 there was no substantial evidence in the record for such an assertion. The County's new

26 assertion that the pools were not vernal pools required recirculation.

31.

27 Inadequate Assessment of Impacts to Downstream Endangered Species. Both
CDFW and DPR pointed out that the DEIR did not address impacts to the endangered least
28 Bell's vireo, the southwestern willow flycatcher and the willow flycatcher, which are
PETITION AND COMPLAINT (GOV. CODE,
CEQA, HILLSIDE MANAGEMENT ORD.) 9

1 downstream from the site.7 CDFW indicated there should be 4:1 habitat mitigation, but this was

2 not provided for, and there was no demonstration that such mitigation would be infeasible, much

3 less that it was not required. The County relied on the use of "best management practices"

4 (*BMPs") that for the most part it did not adopt as mitigation, and there was no substantial

5 evidence in the record that these measures would assure sufficient water quality and quantity to

6 support these species. The DEIR should have been recirculated with a proper discussion of this

7 impact.

8 32. Inadequate Assessment of Impacts to Rare Plants and Inadequate Mitigation;

9 Need for Recirculation. CDFW commented regarding the translocation of mariposa lilies that it

10 was unaware of any successful translocation efforts, and that it knew of at least one instance

11 where a transplantation effort damaged the existing population on the site. There was no

12 substantial evidence to support the developer's conclusion that its vague plans would work.

13 CDFW commented that it could not comment on the location, technique, success criteria,
14 monitoring methods, density, funding adequacy, protection or length of monitoring proposed for

15 the relocation efforts for the numerous rare plants because they were not provided for in the
16 DEIR. The County's identification of bare "mitigation ratios," all of which CDFW found
17 insufficient, does not constitute "specific performance criteria" permitting deferred mitigation

18 under CEQA. Additionally, as CDFW clarified, the length of monitoring was inadequate to

19 assure success of the mitigation. Finally, CDFW pointed out there was only one nursery in the

20 state qualified to store the plant material needed for translocation, and the County refused to
21 commit to using that nursery.8

22 33. Inadequate Assessment of Impacts to the Burrowing Owl; Inadequate Mitigation;

23 Need to Recirculate. CDFW, Petitioner's expert, and others commented that the assessment of
24

25 7 For that matter, people are downstream from the site, in that there is swimming in Castaic

26 Lagoon, which Grasshopper Creek drains into.
8 The County issued a 'Draft Special Status Plant Mitigation 'Plan'* with the FEIR, which
27 meant the DEIR should have been recirculated with it. Additionally, the area proposed for plant mitigation onsite was also proposed CAGN habitat, meaning that relocation could be
28 prohibited as it could result in take of the CAGN. Further, the "Plan" did not distinguish between the two types of mariposa lily on the site, although one is far rarer.
PETITION AND COMPLAINT (GOV. CODE,
CEQA, HILLSIDE MANAGEMENT ORD.) 10

impacts to the burrowing owl ("BUOW") was not adequate because no compliant breeding

2 survey was done per the CDFW 2012 Staff Report. While the developer attempted to remedy

3 this with a survey in 2017, the survey was patently inadequate: as Petitioner's expert noted, that
4 survey effort involved two people spending six hours over the course of three days. Assuming

5 that the area (both disturbed areas and grasslands) covered 500 acres of the site, this meant the
6 surveyors spent roughly 14 seconds per acre in their survey. There were additional documented
7 problems with how the survey was conducted relative to the manner required under the 2012

8 Staff Report. Additionally, the EIR contained insufficient mitigation measures regarding

9 excluding wintering BUOW from the site, and lacked any plan to purchase or maintain adequate
10 (or any) BUOW habitat elsewhere.

11 34. Preconstruction Surveys Are Inadequate as Mitigation; the DEIR Lacked an
12 Adequate Baseline. As both CDFW and Petitioner's expert commented, the DEIR repeatedly

13 relied on preconstruction surveys as supposedly avoiding impacts. However, preconstruction

14 surveys should follow focused detection surveys both because (1) the public should be informed

15 of the extent of environmental impacts to sensitive species, and (2) the detection surveys are

16 necessary for the agency to properly formulate mitigation measures (after receiving comments
17 from responsible agencies, among other things). This was not done here. The DEIR and FEIR's
18 conclusion that species impacts would be mitigated to less than significant based on
19 preconstruction surveys was not supported by substantial evidence. Even more to the point, the

20 County's own SCVAP EIR (upon which this one supposedly tiered) required protocol-level

21 detection surveys at the Project level, yet the County refused to do them. As Petitioner's expert

22 clarified, the County's conclusion that species were absent based on a lack of records in the a

23 California Natural Diversity Data Base was not supported by substantial evidence, and the

24 County's refusal to acknowledge sightings noted in eBird was similarly unfounded.9

25 35. Inadequate Assessment of Impacts to Bats; Recirculation Required. The DEIR

26

27 9 As Petitioner's expert noted, "the County dismissed eBird as unprofessional while at the
28 same time claiming that cursory walkover during 3 days in the middle of California's most intense drought in history was consistent with industry standards and therefore professional." PETITION AND COMPLAINT (GOV. CODE,
CEQA, HILLSIDE MANAGEMENT ORD.) 11

P included no assessment of impacts to bats and special status bats. After CDFW and Petitioner's
2 expert commented this was inadequate, the developer conducted surveys over three nights in July

3 of 2017. Those surveys detected 10 species of bat, 7 with special status. The DEIR should have

4 been recirculated with this information. The County claimed that despite the identification of the

5 bats onsite there was no significant impact to them, but there was no substantial evidence for this

6 conclusion, as CDFW noted.10 As Petitioner's biologist clarified, impacts to those species from

7 the Project could be significant." Further, the County concluded that species other than those

8 actually detected in the three nights were not present, without a substantial evidence basis.

9 36. Deferral of Mitigation in General. The County repeatedly deferred the
10 development of mitigation plans and the actual imposition of mitigation requirements, repeatedly

11 allowing for future studies and mitigation based on what those studies turned up. This is
12 inappropriate under CEQA, which requires at a minimum that the lead agency (1) show that the

13 mitigation could not have been developed prior to circulation of the DEIR, and (2) set forth
14 specific and measurable performance criteria sufficient to demonstrate that the mitigation will
15 actually succeed. None of the County's deferrals met these standards.

16 37. Inadequacy of the "Conceptual Habitat Mitigation Plan"; Need for
17 Recirculation. The DEIR failed to contain a habitat mitigation plan; the County came out with a
18 "Conceptual Plan" with the FEIR. The "Conceptual Plan" took credit for 182 acres of on-site
19 mitigation at a 1:1 ratio immediately after conceding that such a ratio was unwarranted for the
20 habitat on the site. The "Conceptual Plan" improperly deferred the development of a Habitat

21 Mitigation and Monitoring Plan ("HMMP") and relied upon a series of general, exceedingly
22 flexible factors for "consideration" of off-site lands for mitigation, and it failed to actually

23
10 CDFW further commented that the DEIR failed to assess impacts to the ringtail; the County 24 took the position in response that it was not present because there were no California Natural Diversity Database ("CNDDB") records. The absence of a CNDDB record does not prove 25 the absence of a species, particularly not on private lands.

26 11 Here, as in numerous other places in the EIR, the County took the position that there would be no significant impact to a special status species unless the Project would "cause regional
27 populations to fall below self-sustaining levels," and would not impact a "substantial population," but (1) the County had no scientific basis for concluding that these standards
28 would not be met, and (2) the standards are not the proper standard for impacts to species. Appendix G provides that standard.
PETITION AND COMPLAINT (GOV. CODE,
CEQA, HILLSIDE MANAGEMENT ORD.) 12

1 identify the mitigation sites. As Petitioner's expert clarified, without the identification of a
2 specific site, there was not substantial evidence the Project would work, because there have been

3 cases where projects have been approved and mitigation has subsequently been found to be

4 infeasible.

5 38. Significant Greenhouse Gas Impacts Not Acknowledged; Inadequate Mitigation.

6 The DEIR concluded that the Project's greenhouse gas ("GHG") impacts would be less than
7 significant because the Project supposedly complied with the County's Climate Action Plan

8 ("CCAP"). However, the Project was not compliant with the CCAP, and the CCAP only looked

9 to the 2020 horizon. The Supreme Court, the Legislature, the Governor's Office and the
10 California Air Resources Board have made more than clear that agencies must assess compliance

11 with the goals not simply of AB 32 but also of SB 32, which requires a 40% reduction below

12 1990 emission levels by 2030, and Executive Order S-3-05, which requires an 80% reduction

13 below 1990 emission levels by 2050.12 The DEIR acknowledged that the Project will generate

14 GHGs of at least 66,083 metric tons of CO2 per year ("MTCO2e"), and that mitigation measures

15 (some of which, such as the Transportation Demand Management ("TDM") Plan, were entirely

16 unproven) would reduce that amount by less than 10,000 MTCO2e.13 The County's analysis
17 failed to proceed by law and was not supported by substantial evidence. Because impacts were

18 significant, the County had to impose further mitigations (and the County failed to proceed by

19 law in failing to impose additional feasible mitigation proposed by CBD such as committing to

20 zero net energy on the site, to more EV charging stations, to more renewable energy, and to a

21

22 12 Nor did the DEIR acknowledge or assess compliance with Executive Order B-16-2012,
23 which calls for an 80% reduction of GHG emissions from the transportation sector by 2050. Finally, Petitioner notes that Executive Order S-3-05's target was recently made even more
24 stringent by Executive Order B-55-18, which requires the State to be fully carbon neutral by 2045. That Order predated the Board of Supervisors' action on the Project, although it was
25 apparently not considered by the Board.
13

26 These GHG impacts were likely understated because, among other things, the County demanded that the Project involve an additional 323 housing units as opposed to industrial

27 and commercial development, and this would lead to multiple additional long commutes. The County claimed that this issue was dealt with in an Errata, but that Errata was not made available with the Board of Supervisors' packet.
28

PETITION AND COMPLAINT (GOV. CODE,
CEQA, HILLSIDE MANAGEMENT ORD.) 13

local offset program. 14 Additionally, those mitigations the County imposed were not enforceable

2 (the County failed to proceed by law in this respect) and they therefore do not present substantial
evidence that impacts would be mitigated to less than significant levels. Among other things,

4 there was no support in the record for the TDM Plan's supposed reductions.

5 39. Conclusions Regarding Fire Safety Not Supported by Substantial Evidence. The

6 County improperly concluded that the Project, approved in a Very High Fire Hazard Severity
7 Zone, would not lead to more fires and risk exacerbating the risk of wildfire on the site. The

8 County concluded the Project would not lead to further fires because it was not "high density,"

9 but (1) the assumption that "low density" development cannot exacerbate fire risk was
10 unsupported, and (2) the development called for up to 18 units per acre, which is high density for

11 single family homes.

12 40. Inadequate Assessment of Impacts to Numerous Special Status Bird Species;
13 Inadequate Mitigation. The County improperly concluded that impacts to several bird species

14 would be less than significant because, supposedly, those birds do not nest on the site, but (1)

15 absent protocol surveys, there was no basis for concluding this, and (2) nesting alone cannot
16 sustain birds, they must also forage, and losing foraging habitat, not evaluated by the EIR, could
17 be significant. 15 Further, the EIR improperly planned mitigation for lost habitat for the least

18 Bell's vireo and southwestern willow flycatcher habitat at a 2:1 ratio, when CDFW recommends

19 a 5:1 ratio in the south coast region. The planned habitat mitigation for the CAGN was

20 inadequate given that the specie's range is shifting northward due to climate change, and the

21 ratio of 2:1 was again inadequate. The mitigation habitat should always be provided prior to

22 Project construction but the County did not make this commitment. Finally, Petitioner provided

23 clear evidence that the nesting season for raptors begins January 1, not February 1, but the

24 County failed to modify its mitigation measure to address this.

25

26 14 The County claimed it was imposing "grey water systems," but the FEIR conceded that the

27 County was simply going to provide information to future residents.
15 The County claimed that an analysis based only on nesting habitat was "industry standard"
28 without a substantial evidence basis for that; in any event, it is science that presents the CEQA standard, not what developers' consultants may choose to do for expediency.
PETITION AND COMPLAINT (GOV. CODE,
CEQA, HILLSIDE MANAGEMENT ORD.) 14

1 41. Petitioner's expert noted that eBird disclosed that a California condor - perhaps

2 one of the rarest birds in the wild - had been discovered over the site. The County ignored the

3 sighting. Then an "Errata" to the EIR conceded that 8 condors were sighted - one on the ground

4 at or near the site in 2018. Despite this information, the County failed to acknowledge a

5 significant impact to the species or to formulate any mitigation. An Errata to the EIR was

6 insufficient to address this significant new impact.

7 42. The EIR also failed to address a significant potential impact to bald eagles and

8 golden eagles, despite substantial evidence they could use the site for foraging habitat, and

9 regarding the golden cagle, it failed to acknowledge significant cumulative impacts due to the
10 eagle's tendency not to fly over human-occupied spaces.

11 43. The county claimed that "After nearly 20 years of biological surveys on the

12 Project site, the ferruginous hawk has been observed only a few times during the winter season,'

13 as if surveys for the hawk had been done in the winter. They had not, nor had any species other

14 than the BUOW been surveyed for in the winter, and that was only during at most three winters.

15 The County's claim was deliberately misleading. Again, the County used an improper standard
16 to determine lack of a significant impact to the species.

17 44. The EIR failed to assess impacts to the Swainson's hawk, the white-tailed kite,

18 and the merlin, again without a substantial evidence basis. The County actually discounted a
19 special status bird that was present, the tricolored blackbird, on the ground it had not seen more
20 than one, and contended that the bird was absent based on a lack of references to it in eBird and

21 the Los Angeles Breeding Bird Atlas, though these are voluntary databases.

22 45. Inadequate Analysis of Impacts to Grasshopper Creek. The EIR improperly
23 concluded that it would impact "only 26 percent of the Grasshopper Canyon Watershed," as
24 opposed to actually conceding it would destroy 3.5 miles of Grasshopper Creek, a blue line
25 stream, itself. The EIR's claim of no significant impact is contrary to Guidelines Appendix G's
26 standard that an impact is significant if it will "have a substantial adverse effect on any riparian

27 habitat." The EIR further assumes that's BMPs, which are legally required by water quality

28 agencies, will protect water quality for species downstream, even though many streams in
PETITION AND COMPLAINT (GOV. CODE,
CEQA, HILLSIDE MANAGEMENT ORD.) 15

-

2 Southern California fail to meet state and federal water quality control standards despite the

3 implementation of BMPs, and even though the standard for protecting wildlife must necessarily

4 be more stringent. The EIR failed to even incorporate the BMPs as mitigation measures anyway,
in a failure to proceed by law.

5 46.

6 The EIR Fails to Address a Variety of Impacts to Wildlife. The EIR failed to limit

7 free roaming domestic animals, or to assess the inevitable impacts to wildlife they will cause. It

8 failed to provide a specific Integrated Pest Management Program. It failed to limit the impacts

9 of residents or their pets entering into sensitive areas, providing only for "split rail fencing" to

10 supposedly limit these impacts. It failed to provide for worker or resident awareness programs.
47.

11 Inadequate Mitigation for Air Quality Impacts. The County failed to adopt all

12 feasible mitigation for the significant air quality impacts it acknowledged would occur because
of the Project. CBD offered multiple mitigation measures recommended by several air quality
13 management districts, but the County ignored them entirely.

14 48.

15 Inadequate Baseline for Species Onsite. A number of special status species were
not searched for onsite with any sort of focused effort. Instead, the developer relied on 3 days of
16 general surveys in April 2014, during the worst drought in California's recorded history. Among

17 the species the EIR improperly excluded which might be present are the San Joaquin pocket
18 mouse, the Los Angeles pocket mouse, and the Tehachapi pocket mouse. The DEIR was
19 apparently deliberately misleading in leaving out any note of the presence of the desert woodrat,
20 which the County acknowledged was present in the FEIR,

21 49.- Failure to Assess Automobile Collision Impacts and Bird Strikes to Buildings.
22 The County improperly concluded there would be no impacts to special status species because of

23

24 the road construction and use onsite, even though there was no reason for assuming that only

25 common species would be affected. And the EIR failed to assess impacts to birds from striking
buildings on the Project site, even in the face of documented evidence that this would lead to
26 thousands of fatalities. Further the County refused to mitigate for these significant impacts, even

27 though such mitigation was plainly feasible.

28 50. Failure to Assess Cumulative Impacts. The County used an inappropriate
PETITION AND COMPLAINT (GOV. CODE,
CEQA, HILLSIDE MANAGEMENT ORD.) 16

F standard for assessing cumulative impacts, and improperly relied on a list of projects identified

2 for cumulative traffic impacts as the basis for its conclusions.

3 51. Riparian Trees. MM 5.2-3 regarding the loss of riparian trees was insufficiently

4 specific and improperly deferred, and the EIR failed to assess potentially significant impacts to
the trees or the birds that depended on them.

6 52. Special Status Reptiles. The County failed to find a significant impact to special

7 status reptiles which would be crushed by the Project even though it acknowledged that its

8 mitigation measure for capturing them, MM 5.2-10, would be unlikely to work.

9 53. Alternatives Analysis. CDFW, SMMC, and CBD all urged the County and the

10 developer to consider clustered development on the site to avoid impacts to the numerous

11 sensitive resources onsite. The County dismissed such an approach from any serious

12 consideration. While it initially identified a "Creek Avoidance Alternative," it rejected that

13 alternative on the ground that utility lines would have to cross the Creek, which might lead to

14 risks of contamination. As CBD noted, the risk of contamination in the Creek Avoidance

15 Alternative was hardly outweighed by the certainty of destroying the Creek entirely because of

16 the proposed Project. Moreover, there was no substantial evidence that the Creek Avoidance

17 Alternative would be economically infeasible, and the County's post hoc justification that the
18 Alternative would not involve the development of affordable housing units was insufficient
19  because the Creek Avoidance Alternative could have involved affordable housing units just as
20 much as the proposed Project did. (Again, the County only added these affordable units at the

21 last minute and they were not evaluated in the DEIR.)16

22 54. The DEIR further failed to analyze a low carbon alternative. The County claimed

23 this was unnecessary because the Project supposedly did not have significant GHG impacts, but

24

25 16 The County also justified rejecting the Alternative on the ground that the Alternative would not reduce vehicle miles traveled ("VMT") like the Project, but the County elsewhere
26 conceded that the Project would not reduce VMT either, so there was no substantial evidence for the County's conclusion.

27 Finally, incredibly, the County claimed that the Alternative was infeasible because it would require the development of parks, when the Project is surrounded by the Castaic SRA, and
28 because it would require the development of a school or schools, when the Project does not commit to the development of the schools either.
PETITION AND COMPLAINT (GOV. CODE,
CEQA, HILLSIDE MANAGEMENT ORD.) 17

- the County was wrong on this front.

2 55. The DEIR and FEIR further exposed the arbitrariness of the County's planning
3 process because the DEIR included a "No Industrial Development" alternative which was
4 rejected because it did not include industrial development - even though the Project approved by

5 the County did not either.

6 56. Finally, the EIR's consideration of alternatives reflected no reasonable range of

7 alternatives because there were no alternatives carried forward for further consideration that

8 reduced impacts to biological resources. While the County's position was that impacts to

9 biological resources were less than significant, that position was not backed up by substantial
10 evidence.17

11 57. Failure to Exercise Independent Judgment. The County failed to exercise its
12 independent judgment on the record, repeatedly relying on studies transmitted by consultants to

13 the developer (in virtually all cases after the DEIR had been circulated, another violation of
14 CEQA). The County's actions represent a failure to proceed by law, and the studies sent to the
15 developer do not represent substantial evidence because there is no evidence the County
16 critically reviewed them.

17 58. Findings Not Supported by Substantial Evidence. The County's Findings to

18 support its Statement of Overriding Considerations and approving the Project were not supported

19 by substantial evidence regarding the claims that the community would benefit, that the Castaic

20 SRA would be unharmed, that all feasible mitigation measures had been adopted, that
21 alternatives (including the Creek Avoidance Alternative) were infeasible, and that the Project

22 met the Project's objectives. 18

23 59. Violation of Laws Related to Specific Plans, and the County's Own Hillside

24
As SMMC wrote, the County failed to demonstrate why a less damaging alternative was 25 infeasible. The County typically requires a 50% open space dedication, and this Project is

26 not even close to achieving such a dedication.
18 The DEIR improperly concluded that the Project met the objective of "reduc[ing] offsite trips
27 and vehicle miles traveled," DEIR at 4-3, when the FEIR conceded that it was too speculative to conclude that onsite jobs would be filled by future residents; in any event,
28 most of those onsite jobs were eliminated by the Project as revised and adopted by the Planning Commission and subsequently the Board of Supervisors.
PETITION AND COMPLAINT (GOV. CODE,
CEQA, HILLSIDE MANAGEMENT ORD.) 18

1 Management Ordinance. The County effectively amended the 1992 Specific Plan by changing

2 items included therein as recognized by, inter alia, Government Code sections 65451(a)(2),

3 65451(a)(1), and 65451(a)(3). The proposed utilities and sewer systems are inconsistent with

4 those provided in the Specific Plan; the proposed number of lots, sizes of lots and number of

5 homes planned for in Phase 2 differ significantly from those provided for in the 1992 Specific

6 Plan. The County's Hillside Area Management Ordinance applied because the Project is not

7 consistent with the 1992 Specific Plan, and the County failed to proceed by law in not complying

8 with that Ordinance.

9 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

10 Failure to Analvze All Potentially Significant Impacts; Findings Not Based on Substantial

11 Evidence

12 [CEQA, Pub. Res. Code §§ 21000 et seq.]

13 60. Petitioner reincorporates and realleges paragraphs 1 through 59 as if fully set

14 forth.

15 61. CEQA requires that a lead agency identify all potentially significant impacts of a
16 project. It further requires that the lead agency's findings must be based on substantial evidence.

17 Pub. Resources Code § 21082.2. As to those significant impacts, the lead agency must take all

18 feasible steps to mitigate them or to develop alternatives, and if those impacts remain significant,

19 the agency must adopt a statement of overriding considerations.

20 62. The DEIR failed to fully analyze significant impacts to biological resources in

21 numerous respects, as well as GHGs, as discussed above. The County failed to make findings of

22 significance, it failed to impose mitigation measures or adopt alternatives, and it failed to adopt a

23 statement of overriding considerations based on substantial evidence as to those impacts.

24 63. All of the County's findings lacked a substantial evidence basis and represented a

25 failure to proceed by law as required by CEQA.

26 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

27 Failure to Include All Critical Information in the DEIR

28 [CEQA, Pub. Res. Code § 21000 et seq.]
PETITION AND COMPLAINT (GOV. CODE, CEQA, HILLSIDE MANAGEMENT ORD.) 19

1 64. Petitioner reincorporates and realleges paragraphs 1 through 63 as if fully set
2 forth.

3 65. The DEIR failed to include critical information in the document itself, burying
4 key elements in Appendices or leaving it out entirely in violation of established precedent.

5 Further, the DEIR failed to include many Appendices which were not issued until the FEIR was

6 completed, and there was an Errata that was apparently never made available to the public.

7 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

8 Failure to Adequately Mitigate All Potentially Significant Impacts; Findings Not Based on

•9 Substantial Evidence

10 [CEQA, Pub. Res. Code §§ 21000 et seq.]

11 66. Petitioner reincorporates and realleges paragraphs 1 through 65 as if fully set
12 forth.

13 67. CEQA requires an agency to adopt feasible mitigation measures that will
14 substantially lessen or avoid the project's potentially significant impacts and to describe those
15 mitigation measures in the DEIR and in a Mitigation Monitoring & Reporting Program to be

16 adopted by the agency with the certification of the EIR.

17 68. A lead agency must impose all feasible mitigation measures to reduce impacts to
18 less than significant levels. And a lead agency's findings that it has imposed all feasible
19 mitigation measures must be supported by substantial evidence.

20 69. The County failed to adequately mitigate for multiple significant impacts as

21 discussed above.

22 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

23 Findings Not Based on Substantial Evidence

24 [CEQA, Pub. Res. Code § 21000 et seq.]

25 70. Petitioner reincorporates and realleges patagraphs 1 through 69 as if fully set

26 forth.

27 71. CEQA requires that an agency must adopt findings that support its conclusions on

28 its review of an EIR. Those findings must be based on substantial evidence in the whole record.
PETITION AND COMPLAINT (GOV. CODE,
CEQA, HILLSIDE MANAGEMENT ORD.) 20

1 72. The County's conclusion that the impacts were not significant in numerous areas

2 relating to biological resources as well as GHGs was not based on substantial evidence and

3 represented a failure to proceed by law.

4 73. The County's conclusion that the overriding considerations it identified to justify

5 the Project despite its significant impacts, were not based on substantial evidence.

6 74. The County's finding that it had mitigated all significant impacts to the fullest

7 extent feasible was not based on substantial evidence.

8 75. The County's findings that alternatives were infeasible were not based on

9 substantial evidence.

10 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

11 Inadequate Alternatives Analysis

12 [CEQA, Pub. Res. Code § 21000 et seq.]

13 76. Petitioner reincorporates and realleges paragraphs 1 through 75 as if fully set

14 forth.

15 77. CEQA and the Guidelines require that a DEIR identify and discuss alternatives to

16 a proposed project, and that it identify the impacts within each impact area for a given a
17 alternative.

18 78. The DEIR failed to address a reasonable range of alternatives, failed to address

19 any possible alternative sites, and failed to adequately assess the alternatives it did discuss.

20 79. The DEIR's findings in this regard were entirely absent or were not based on

21 substantial evidence and represented a failure to proceed by law.

22 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

23 Failure to Comply with State Zoning and Planning Law

24 [Gov. Code § 65000 et seq-]

25 80. Petitioner reincorporates and realleges paragraphs 1 through 79 as if fully set

26 forth.

27 81. The County significantly changed the provisions of the Specific Plan in approving

28 the Project, and it was therefore required to amend its Specific Plan, under Gov. Code sections
PETITION AND COMPLAINT (GOV. CODE,
CEQA, HILLSIDE MANAGEMENT ORD.) 21

1 65451(a)(2), 65451(a)(1), and 65451(a)(3).

2. 82. The County's failure to abide by these requirements represented a failure to

3 comply with a mandatory duty, failure to proceed by law and an abuse of discretion.

4 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

5 Failure to Comply with County Hillside Area Management Ordinance

6 [County Code § 22.56.217]

7 83. Petitioner reincorporates and realleges paragraphs 1 through 82 as if fully set

8 forth.

9 84. The County had to comply with the Hillside Management Ordinance because it

10 effectively amended the Specific Plan in approving the Project, and the Project was not

11 consistent with the existing Specific Plan.

12 WHEREFORE, Petitioner and Plaintiff prays

13 1. For the Court's peremptory writ of mandate requiring the County to set aside its

14 decision approving the EIR for the Project (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168, 21168.5,

19 3. For a judgment enforcing the duty imposed upon County by CEQA to adequately

20 address potential individual and cumulative impacts to the environment in any

21 subsequent action taken regarding the Project,

22 4. For a judgment enforcing the duty imposed upon the County by CEQA to

23 adequately consider mitigation to reduce significant impacts in any subsequent

24 action taken to approve the Project,

26 circulate and consider a legally adequate Environmental Impact Report and

27 otherwise comply with CEQA in any subsequent action taken to approve this

28 Project,
PETITION AND COMPLAINT (GOV. CODE,
CEQA, HILLSIDE MANAGEMENT ORD.) 22

F 6. For a judgment requiring the County to comply with the State Zoning and

2 Planning Law by requiring it to formally amend its Specific Plan, if it is to pursue

3 development in accordance therewith,

4 7. For a judgment requiring the County to comply with the terms of its Hillside
Management Ordinance since the Project is not in compliance with the Specific

6 Plan,

7 8. For a judgment invalidating the Development Agreement as contrary to law,

8 9. For costs of suit, including attorney's fees under Code of Civil Procedure '

9 1021.5 and other provisions of law, and
