REQUEST FOR HEARING

INTRODUCTION

2. 1. By this Verified Petition ("Petition"), Petitioners Nicholas Jimenez and

3 unincorporated association Koreatown for the Environment and Responsible Development
4 ("KERD") (collectively "Petitioners") challenge the approval by the City of Los Angeles

5 ("City"), its Department of City Planning ("DCP"), and its City Council ("Council") (collectively

6 "Respondents") in approving a hotel project to be developed by La Villa Puente Limited
7 Partnership ("Developer" or "Real Party"). Specifically, 011 May 30, 2018, the City finally
8 approved various land use approvals ("Entitlements") and adopted a Categorical Exemption
9 ("CE") (collectively "Approvals") in furtherance of the demolition of six, single-story, rent-

10 stabilized residential structures and the construction/maintenance of a new 99-room hotel totaling
11 approximately 51,635 square feet ("sf.") of development ("Project") at 966 South Dewey in the
12 City of Los Angeles in a sub-region known as the "Koreatown" ("Site").
13 2. As set forth in the First Cause of Action herein, Petitioners allege that the Project
14 Approvals violated the City's eneral Plan, other applicable land use plans, the City Charter, and
15 various provisions of the Los Angeles Municipal Code ("LAMC" or "Code"), including DCP's
16 failure to: require the Developer to seek a Variance from Code provisions prohibiting hotels mid-
17 block in Koreatown absent specific findings; support its Code-required findings with substantial
18 evidence, such as the Project's consistency with applicable land use plans when it is spot-zoned in
19 a sea of more-restrictive zoning that conflicts with the prevailing land use patterns of the 90-plus
20 city-blocks within the Koreatown planning area; or support its public-safety findings pursuant to
21 an adequate environmental review documents including analysis of all resources potentially
22 affected by this Project.

23 3. Petitioners also challenge the Project for violations of the California
24 Environmental Quality Act, Pub. Res. Code § 21000 et seq., ("CEQA"). Specifically, as set forth
25 in the Second Cause of Action, Respondents used a CE, in lieu of a more comprehensive
26 Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND*) or Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"), despite
27 numerous comments establishing a fair argument that the Project poses various significant

28
-2-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

} environmental impacts including but not limited to noise, land use consistency, traffic,

2 aesthetics/shadow, air quality and greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions, and cumulative impacts.
3 The City concedes that substantial evidence exists that the use of a CE was improper given DCP
4 adopted ten, Project-specific Conditions of Approval to mitigate construction and operational
5 noise impacts that were explicitly requested by a Koreatown resident..As set forth in the Third

6 Cause of Action, Respondents failed to analyze all environmental impacts by ignoring substantial
7 evidence necessitating the preparation of an MND or EIR, which precluded the full consideration

8 of additional environmental resources typically considered under proper CEQA review. Finally,
9 as set forth in the Fourth Cause of Action, Respondents failed to consider adoption of additional
10 feasible mitigation measures that would further reduce potential environmental impacts.
11 JURISDICTION

12 4. This Court has jurisdiction under Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168 or 21168.5 and Code
13 Civ. Proc §§ 1085 or 1094.5. The parties and the Project Site are located in Los Angeles County
14 with the City responsible for the Project's compliance with applicable local/state zoning laws and
15 DCP serving as the lead agency under CEQA. As applicable here, the City bifurcated the Project
16 Approvals with the Entitlements and CE being approved in the first instance by a Zoning
17 Administrator ("ZA") with appeals being decided by the Central Area Planning Commission
18 (*APC"*). However, only the CE is appealable to Council with no further appeals allowed to
19 challenge the Entitlements, which were made final with the mailing of APC's Letter of
20 Determination on May 30, 2018. While a timely-filed CE-appeal is currently pending Council
21 action, the City has not adopted a formal CEQA appeal procedure or provide any guidance on the
22 Council's remedial authority when considering CEQA determinations made by non-elected DCP

23 staff or commissions. Whereas Petitioners hope that Council gives due consideration of the
24 appeal and reserve all inherent authority to cure the CEQA defects discussed herein, including but
25 not limited to vacating the Project's Entitlements and preventing the Project from moving forward
26 until defects have been cured, the City may forego said consideration absent filing this Petition.
27 Hence, Petitioners face a "true controversy regarding [the] City's compliance with CEQA [is]
28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

P thus presented, and expeditious filing of any challenge on that ground [is] necessary." Stockton
2 Citizens for Sensible Planning City of Stockton (2010) 48 Cal.4th 481, 510.

3 5, Therefore, the within action has been timely brought within 90 days of the final
V Approval of the Project's Entitlements per Gov. Code 65009. Similarly, this Petition is timely
5 brought within 35 days from properly filed Notice of Exemption ("NOE") and within 180 days

6 after the City's approval of the Project per Pub. Res. Code § 21167 and 14 Cal. Code Regs.
7 ("CEQA Guidelines") § 15112. Any NOE filed before the City's final action on the timely CE-
8 appeal is premature and ineffective. See e.g., Coalition for Clean Air V. City of Visalia (2012)
9 209 Cal.App.4th 408, 418, 425 (a prematurely filed NOE is "invalid"); McAllister v. County of
10 Monterey (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 253, 274; San Franciscans for Reasonable. Growth v. San
11 Francisco (1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 61; 70 n9; Alta Loma v. San Bernardino County Comm. (1981)
12 124 Cal.App.3d 542 (decision not final if appeals not exhausted or remain pending); Practice
13 Under CEQA (2d ed. CEB 2018) § 23.111 ("[a]n agency's decision is not final until all
14 administrative appeals have been completed. An agency should wait until the time for filing an
15 administrative appeal has run before filing a notice of determination or exemption . if an appeal
16 is filed, a new notice of determination would have to be filed after the appeal has been decided."),
17 6. Petitioners served a Notice of Intent to file this Petition on Respondents pursuant
18 to Pub. Res. Code § 21167.5 by mail on August 28, 2018, as reflected in Exhibit A attached
19 hereto. Concurrent with the filing of this action, Petitioners will notify the Attorney General of
20 the State of California of the filing of this Petition within ten days after the commencement of this

21 proceeding in accordance with Pub. Res. Code § 21167.7.

22 7. As alleged herein, the violations by Respondents have affected the beneficial
23 interests of Petitioners and/or their supporting members, as well as enforcement of important
24 rights affecting the public interest. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a
25 substantial benefit on the public, including citizens, residents, businesses, and taxpayers affected
26 in Koreatown, and will result in the enforcement of important public rights by requiring
27

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Respondents and Real Party to comply with CEQA and other legal requirements applicable to the

2 proposed Project.

8. Petitioners have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy under ordinary law unless
this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside the Project
Approvals and prohibiting Respondents and Real Party from taking further actions concerning the
Project until it has complied with those legal requirements. In the absence of such remedies,
Respondents' decisions will remain in effect in violation of state law and injurious to Petitioners.
The relief sought by way of this Petition will redress the likelihood of future injury and
interference with Petitioners' beneficial interests, their supporting members, and the public's

10 interest in having the law duly followed.

11 PARTIES

12 9. Petitioners Nicholas Jimenez is an individual and Koreatown residents in the City

13 of Los Angeles and have a beneficial interest and will be impacted by the matters set forth in this

14 Petition. His interests, and the public interest, will be directly affected by the Project and

15 Respondents' failure to comply with the zoning/CEQA requirements involving the Project. Mr.

16 Jimenez lives roughly two lots away from the Site and will be affected by negative Project

17 impacts including but not limited to noise, land use incompatibility, traffic, air quality/GHG

18 emissions, aesthetic/shadow impacts, and other CEQA deficiencies.

19 10. Petitioner KERD is an unincorporated association operating under designated

20 name by which it is known whose members include affected individuals including Petitioner

21 Jimenez who have a beneficial interest in the matters set forth in this Petition including being

22 affected by the negative impacts of the Project. Petitioner's mission is to ensure responsible

23 development in Los Angeles, particularly in Koreatown, and informed decisionmaking by public

24 officials and state agencies with regard to projects that may cause significant impacts to the

25 environment in the City of Los Angeles. KERD was formed after the date of Project Approval

26 pursuant to Pub. Res. Code 21167(c).

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

11. Petitioners, individually and through their members, objected to the Project

2 Approvals orally and/or in writing before the close of the public hearing on the Project,

3 Petitioners have exhausted all administrative remedies in that the determinations by the
4 Respondents are final and no further administrative appeal procedures are provided by State or

5 local law. All issues submitted for judicial review in this Petition were sufficiently raised and

6 disputed with Respondents before the final approval of the Project. Respondents were given
notice and the opportunity to act in compliance with CEQA but failed to do so. It is well-
established that any party who participates in the administrative process can assert all factual and
legal issues raised by any commenting party, official or agency. Citizens for Open Government v.
10 City of Lodi (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 865, 875.
1I 12. Respondent City is a California charter city located in the County of Los Angeles,
12 California. The Project is located wholly within the jurisdiction of the City. The City, acting
13 through its DCP, served as the lead agency during the Project's CEQA review, including the
14 initial determinations that the CE was appropriate for the Project's CEQA review, that a Variance
15 for the Project was no longer required, and ultimately the final approval of the Project's
16 Entitlements. As of the filing of this Petition, a timely-filed City-appeal on the Project's CE is
17 pending action by the City's elected Council. As discussed above, while Petitioners urge the
18 Council to give thorough consideration and reserve all inherent remedial powers, Petitioners
19 nevertheless face an actual controversy regarding the City's compliance with CEQA, and
20 therefore the matter set forth herein is ripe for the expeditious filing of this Petition. Stockton
21 Citizens for Sensible Planning, 48 Cal.4th at 510.

22 13. Petitioners are informed and believe, and based thereon allege, that Real Party

23 Developer is a California corporation doing business as La Villa Puente, LTD, which are

24 collectively and individually believed to be the Project applicant and recipient of the Project

25 Approvals.

therefore, sue said Respondents and Real Parties by fictitious names. Petitioners will amend this
4 Petition to show the true names and capacities when they have been ascertained.

5 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

6 15. THE SITE: For context, the City's General Plan includes a Framework Element

7 that establishes a citywide, long-range strategy to guide the comprehensive update of the General
8 Plan's other ten elements that includes, among others, its Land Use and Circulation/Mobility
9 Elements. The City's Land Use Element divides the City into 35 Community Plans, including the
10 Wilshire Community Plan ("WCP") which includes the subregion known as the Koreatown
II Regional Commercial Center ("Koreatown") that serves as the cultural meeting place and nucleus
12 of Korean American families, businesses, restaurants, and shops. Koreatown consists of 90-plus
13 city-blocks, each consisting of roughly 24 lots, and is generally bounded by Eighth Street (north),
14 Pico Street (south), Western Avenue (west), and Vermont Avenue (east), with Olympic
15 Boulevard bisecting the area (running from east to west), The vast majority of the lots within
16 Koreatown are zoned for multi-family residential uses (R3 and R4 zones) with commercial

17 development (C2 zone) focused solely along the frontage of the abovementioned 56-80-foot
18 thoroughfares designated as Major and Secondary Highways under the former Circulation
19 Element (reclassified as Boulevards and Avenues under the recently-enacted Mobility Plan that
20 served as an update to the Circulation Element).

21 16. Located mid-block between San Marino Street (north) and Olympic Boulevard
22 (south), the "L" shaped Project Site consist of four lots totaling approximately 23,595 sf. with

23 dual frontages on Dewey Avenue (west) and Catalina Street (east). Like the rest of Koreatown,

24 this city-block reflects the prevailing land use designations and patterns with.commercial

25 development located on the six, C2-lots adjacent to the 80-foot Olympic Boulevard and the
26 remaining 20, R4-lots developed primarily with single-family housing along the 30-36-foot
27 Dewey Avenue and Catalina Street (designated as narrower Local Streets under the

28
-7-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Circulation/Mobility Element). The vast majority of structures near the Project Site are no higher

2 than two-stories tall, including the four-lot Site that is zoned R4 that included six single-family

3 homes all one-story tall, four of which subject to the City's Rent Stabilization Ordinance (LAMC

4 § 151.00 et seq.). Under the General Plan's Framework Element, the Site is designated for High
Medium Residential, with the WCP and Wilshire Center/Koreatown Redevelopment Plan

6 (*Redevelopment Plan") designating the Site for Multi-Family Residential.

17. THE PROJECT: Over a two-year construction period, the Project includes the
demolition of the six existing residential structures and the construction/maintenance of a new

9 six-story (81 feet), 99-room boutique hotel including 63 on-site parking spaces, lounge area,

10 fitness room, second-story recreation deck, and other improvements totaling approximately

11 51,635 sf. of development. In furtherance of the Project, Developer sought and the City

12 subsequently approved the Project Approvals challenged herein in this Petition, which includes:

13 Vesting Conditional Use Permit to allow a hotel in the R4 zone ("VCU");

14 Conditional Use Permit to allow the sale and dispensing of a full line of alcoholic

15 beverages accessed by mini-bars within each hotel room/suite ("CUB");

16 Zoning Administrator's Adjustments to allow a five-foot northern/southern side-

17 yard setbacks instead of the minimum nine feet required, and a 15-foot rear-yard

18 setback in lieu of the minimum 18 feet required ("ZAA");

19 - Site Plan Review for the construction, use, and maintenance of a hotel that results

20 in a net increase of more than 50 guest rooms ("SPR"); and

21 - Class 32 Categorical Exemption for infill-development requiring the Project to

22 satisfy various criteria such as consistency with applicable General Plan

23 designations and other zoning regulations, the Site adequately served by existing

24 City infrastructure, and that the Project would not result in significant •

25 environmental impacts including cumulative impacts ("Class 32 CE").

18. ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW & PROJECT APPROVAL HISTORY: In May 2016,

2 Developer applied for the approval of a smaller iteration of the Project (six-story, 70-room hotel)

3 under DCP Case Nos. ZA-2015-4525 and ENV-2015-4526, which included a request for a

4 Variance from the City's prohibition of a hotel within the R4 designation unless the lot fronts "a

5 major or secondary highway" and that "25 percent or more of the area of such lot is also

6 classified in commercial zone." LAMC § 12.11.A.4(b). As discussed above, the Site contains

7 no commercially zoned lots and does not front a major or secondary highway. Unlike the

8 Koreatown C2-lots fronting Olympic Boulevard and other major streets, the Site lies squarely

9 within a sea of low-level, residentially-zoned area. On July 22, 2016, DCP requested additional

10 information and materials from the Developer, which was unanswered and, thus, DCP terminated

11 the case on October 5, 2016.

12 19, Between August and November 2017, the Developer re-applied for approval of the

13 larger, 99-room hotel Project that included the approval of the Entitlements under DCP Case No.

14 ZA-2017-3446 and approval of the Class 32 CE under DCP Case No. ENV-2017-3447 - both

15 requiring specific findings to be made under the Code. Sometime in November, the Developer's

16 representatives prepared a CE justification letter that contained a partial impact analysis (e.g.,

17 traffic, noise, historic, air/GHG emissions); but did not included analysis of other environmental

18 resources typical of a more comprehensive MND or EIR, including but not limited to discussionsl

19 of aesthetics, land use and planning consistency, population/housing, recreational/utility needs,

20 growth-inducing impacts, cumulatively considerable impacts, or project alternatives. Moreover,

21 as typical of most categorical exemptions, the City did not circulate the CE justification letter for

22 public comment to allow adequate vetting by the public or responsible agencies that necessitates a

23 response from the City prior to the Project's approval-which is routine for MNDs and EIRs.

24 20. On January 17, 2018, the DCP held a public hearing where the zoning

25 administrator ("ZA") conditionally approved the Project Approvals, which was made effective by

26 the March 14, 2018 mailing of the ZA Letter of Determination. Therein, the ZA made various

27 perfunctory findings required under the Code before granting the Project Approvals, such as the

28 -9.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Project being compatible in use and scale with the surrounding property and subject to only a

2 minor adjustment for side/rear-yard setbacks. No discussion, nor disclosure, was given that the
Project was originally required to seek a Variance to allow a hotel on the R4 Project Site

4 containing no commercially zoned property and not located on a major/secondary highway (as
discussed above). Nor was there a discussion how the ZAA that provided four feet of relief from-
the otherwise applicable nine-foot, side-yard setbacks (amounting to a 44 percent deviation)

7 comported with the Code-restriction that ZAAs are limited to "no more than 20 percent" relief of

8 yard/area requirements. LAMC § 12.28.B.

9 21. Similarly, the ZA conflated the Project's hotel uses as residential despite the

10 Project being admittedly operated as a commercial enterprise and ignored the prevailing

11 Koreatown land use patterns by claiming the Project's height was not unusual for the vicinity of

12 the Site in scope to other existing residential and commercial uses in the area. Most telling are

13 the projects cited by the ZA to support this finding, which are squarely irrelevant projects

14 untether to the Project or the Site, such as: genuine residential projects located on C2-lots fronting
15 Olympic Boulevard and immediately adjacent to existing commercial uses (e.g., DCP Case Nos.
16 DIR-2014-1953 [construction of a five-story, 70-unit multi-family project]; ZA-2014-3703 [the

17 addition of three stories and 13 residential units to an existing two-story commercial property];

18 DIR-2014-1953[five-story mixed-use project with 70 residential units]; or distant redevelopment

19 projects not even located in Koreatown or subject to the same land use plans (e.g., DCP Case No.

20 ZA-2015-2683 [tenant improvements to existing 18-unit apartment to allow a 24-room hotel

21 located more than five miles from the Site and subject to a different community plan and

22 redevelopment plan]).

23 22. Furthermore, there was an inadequate discussion of crucial General Planning

24 provisions under the Framework Element, including: the overall goal of "maintain existing stable

25 multi-family residential neighborhoods"; or Policy 3.7,2 regarding the "desire of the residents to

26 preserve existing housing and neighborhood qualities." Nor was there an adequate analysis of the

27 Project's direct conflict with WCP provisions, including: issues/opportunities regarding

28
-10-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 residential use that urge the "[n]eed to maintain low density character of single-family

3 neighborhoods, avoiding encroachment from other uses, commercial off-street parking, and

4 "spillover" traffic from adjacent development ... [n]eed to preserve the existing character of

5 residential neighborhoods while accommodating more affordable housing .. [i]mproved land use

6 transitions in scale, density and character are needed between multiple family and adjacent single

7 family neighborhoods ... [i]mproved land use transitions are needed between commercial uses

8 and single family and multiple family areas ... [i]ncreased off-street parking areas and facilities,

9 open space, and recreational facilities are needed, particularly in multiple family residential

11 better cohesiveness, diversity, and continuity of complementary uses along commercial frontages

12 [n]ew commercial development needs to be compatible with existing buildings in terms of

13 architectural design, bulk and building heights." WCP, pp. I-4-5.
23.

14 Similarly, the ZA's cursory review of applicable land use goals/policies failed to

15 reconcile apparent conflicts between the Project and the WCP, such as: Goal 1 to provide a safe, a

16 secure, and high-quality residential environment; Policy 1-I.I to "protect existing stable single

17 family and low density residential neighborhoods from encroachment by higher density

18 residential uses and other uses that are incompatible as to scale and character, or would otherwise

19 diminish quality of life"; Policy 1-1.2 to "[p]romote neighborhood preservation in all stable

20 residential neighborhoods"; Objective 1-3 to "[p]reserve and enhance the varied and distinct

21 residential character and integrity of existing residential neighborhoods"; Policy 1-3.4 to

22 "[m]onitor the impact of new development on residential streets [and] [l]ocate access to major

23 development projects so as not to encourage spillover traffic on local residential streets"; Policy

24 1.4-2 to "[e]nsure that new housing opportunities minimize displacement of residents"; Policy

25 1.4-3 to "[e]ncourage multiple family residential and mixed use development in commercial

26 zones"; Goal 14 to "discourage non-resident traffic flow on local residential streets"; or Objective

27 16-2 to "[e]nsure that the location, intensity and timing of development is consistent with the
provision of adequate transportation infrastructure."

24. Similarly, no meaningful discussion was given to the Koreatown Redevelopment

2 Plan, such as: § 411 that identifies the "[t]he social needs of the community include but are not
limited to the need for day care facilities, housing for very low- and low-income persons"; § 507

4 that new construction "shall comply with all applicable state and local laws in effect" including
without limitation applicable housing provisions under the City's Code; or § 516 that "[n]o use or

6 structure, which by reason of appearance, traffic, smoke, glare, noise, odor or similar factors that

7 would be incompatible with the surrounding areas or structures, shall be permitted in any part of

8 the Project Area."

o 25. The ZA's approval was timely-appealed by two appellants alleging, among other

10 things, the Project was inconsistent with the General Plan and WCP, took issue with the removal

11 of the rent-stabilized residential homes, construction and operational noise impacts, height and

12 shadow impacts, cumulative impacts, and that the Project Approvals warranted further CEQA

13 review. For example, a resident-appellant living next to the Project Site took specific issue with

14 the Project's location and requested various conditions to mitigate construction and operational

15 noise impacts, such as a sound curtain during the Project's construction phase, greater setback of

16 driveway gates to avoid parking noise, and specific operational limitations on the second-story

17 deck that loomed over appellant's property.

18 26. On May 22, 2018, the APC held a public hearing to consider the appeal, which

19 denied the appeals and approved the Project Approvals relying on the same cursory land use

20 findings relied upon by the ZA. However, APC did impose ten, new Conditions of Approval

21 specifically adopted to mitigate noise impactswhich is an admission that CE was

22 inappropriate for the Project's environmental review under CEQA. Nevertheless, the APC

23 decision became final upon the May 30, 2018 mailing of the APC Letter of Determination, which

24 provided that APC's decision on the Entitlements were final and no further City-appeals are

25 provided.

3 more thorough MND or EIR, and that further analysis and feasible mitigation was necessary for

4 various potentially significant environmental impacts.

5 28. EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES: Petitioners, individually and/or

6 through its members, objected to the Project throughout the administrative process by appearing

7 and speaking out against the Project at public hearings held by the Respondents. The violations

8 of law challenged herein this Petition was identified for Respondents orally and/or in writing

9 before the close of the public hearing on the Project. Any and all available appeals of the Project

10 Approvals were pursued, and Respondents' approval of the Project is final with respect to the

11 Project's Entitlements with the City's compliance with CEQA still pending final review.

12 However, absent filing this Petition, Petitioners are informed and believe that the City may forgo

13 its obligation to consider all of its inherent remedial authority to cure the CEQA defects that

14 plague this Project, including but not limited to vacating and setting aside the Project's

15 Entitlements until an adequate CEQA review is prepared.. Therefore, this Action is ripe for

16 adjudication.

17 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

18 (WRIT OF MANDATE AND ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS - CODE CIV. PROC. §§ 1085, 1094.5-

19 • VIOLATIONS OF LAMC, CHARTER, AND APPLICABLE LAND USI PLANS/LAWS)

20 29. Petitioners restate and reallege Paragraphs 1-28 as if fully set forth herein.

21 30. The California Supreme Court has described General Plans and zoning schemes in

22 many ways. See e.g., DeVita V. County of Napa (1995) 9 Cal.4th 763, 773 (as a 'constitution,'

23 "for future development located at the top of "the hierarchy of local government law regulating

24 land use); Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles (1974) 11 Cal.3d 506,

25 a 517-518 (as a 'contracts,' where "each party foregoes rights to use its land as it wishes in return

26 for the assurance that the use of neighboring property will be similarly restricted, the rationale

27 being that such mutual restriction can enhance total community welfare"); Orange Citizens for

28 -13-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Parks & Recreation v. Superior Court (2016) 2 Cal.5th 141, 159 (as a 'yardstick,' where "one

2 should be able to "take an individual parcel and check it against the plan and then know which

3 uses would be permissible"). While planning agencies enjoy some discretion interpreting their

4 zoning laws, "deference has limits" and courts are not bound by unreasonable interpretations
to contrary to the plain language of regulations and statutes. Id. at 146, 156-157 (rejecting attempts

6 to "downplay the facial inconsistency," the Court held the city abused its discretion finding
residential project consistent with general plan designation where "no reasonable person could
conclude that the Property could be developed without a general plan amendment"); see also

9 Stolman, 114 Cal.App.4th at 928-930 (vacating variance based on the zoning administrator's

10 interpretation contradicted by the plain language of the municipal code),.

11 31. Here, Petitioners are informed and believe that granting the Project Approvals

12 constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion by Respondents failing to proceed in the manner

13 required by law or making the Code-required land use findings supported by substantial evidence.

14 This includes but not limited to Respondents' failure to: require the Developer to seek a Variance

15 to allow the hotel use untethered to a commercial lot or major/secondary highway in lieu of the

16 VCU, which does not exempt the Project from "applications or approvals that may be necessary

17 to entitle a project to proceed" such as a "zone variance" (LAMC § 12.24.T.2(a)); failure to make

18 Code-required land use findings supported by substantial evidence for the Project's Entitlements

19 such as the Project's conformity with public necessity, consistent with good zoning practice,

20 compatible with the surrounding property or neighborhood, consistent with and in harmony with

21 the objectives of the General Plan and WCP and Redevelopment Plan, and that the Project will

22 not adversely affect or degrade adjacent properties or surrounding neighborhood (see LAMC §8

23 12.24.E, 12.28.C, 16.05.F); and violation of the City Charter § 588 requiring any rezoning of land

24 to be consistent with the General Plan.

25 32. Without a Project-specific EIR, or at minimum an MND, these findings cannot be

26 made given the numerous potential impacts affecting public safety, such as: whether Project-

27 related traffic will adversely impact the unsignaled, local street segments (Dewey and Catalina);

28 -14.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

failure to adequately survey existing land uses to determine whether existing land uses will be

2 disturbed by introducing an out-of-scale commercial enterprise in the sea of low-level residential

3 uses; failure to consider additional mitigation measures for construction/operational noise

4 impacts; or whether the a Project Approvals will serve as a dangerous precedent resulting in a
cumulatively considerable impact when viewed in connection with the effects of past, other
current, and future projects likely to occur in the wake of Respondents' approval of the Project.
Furthermore, the approval of the Project is disruptive to the existing zoning scheme in the WCP
Koreatown area by essentially spot-zoning the Site to a less-restrictive zoning pattern while
subjecting the rest of the surrounding area to the more-restrictive zoning patterns prevailing under

10 the 90-plus city-blocks within the Koreatown planning area. This is textbook spot-zoning under

11 the Los Angeles CEQA Thresholds Guide that states "[a] 'spot' zone occurs when the zoning or

12 land use designation for only a portion of a block changes, or a single zone or land use a

13 designation becomes surrounded by more or less intensive land uses.' (Los Angeles CEQA

14 Thresholds Guide, H.2-2.) The City's Threshold Guide requires that when a spot-zone occurs due

15 to a project, the environmental review for the project requires further study as alleged below.

16 33. Petitioners have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy at law other than the relief

17 sought in this Petition. If Respondents persist in their refusal to rescind the Project Approval, and

18 if Respondents and Real Party are not enjoined or stayed from undertaking acts in furtherance of

19 the Project, Petitioners and the public will suffer irreparable harm from which there is no

20 adequate remedy at law in that the Project can be occupied, operations commence and significant

21 adverse impacts on the environment would occur, contrary to the requirements of the law.

22 34. For the foregoing reasons, the City has failed to proceed in accordance with

23 applicable land use plans and laws, and therefore Petitioners are entitled to issuance of a writ of

24 mandate setting aside all Project's Entitlements and other Project Approvals.

- SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
N m FAILURE TO PREPARE AN MND OR EIR
(WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS -- CODE CIV. PRO. § 1094.5 -CEQA VIOLATIONS)
4 35. Petitioners restate and reallege Paragraphs 1-34, as if fully set forth herein.

5 36. CEQA has a strong presumption in favor of requiring preparation of an EIR. This

6 presumption is reflected in what is known as the "fair argument" standard, under which an agency

7 must prepare an EIR whenever substantial evidence in the record supports a fair argument that a

8 project may have a significant effect on the environment. Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n v.

9 Regents of the Univ. of Cal. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 1112, 1123; No Oil. Inc, V. City of Los Angeles

10 (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75. A lead agency must prepare an EIR if a project may cause significant

11 effects on the environment, even if the project is beneficial. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21100, 21151 and
12 CEQA Guidelines § 15063(b)(1).

13 37. a The fair argument test is a "low threshold" where a project "may" have a

14 significant effect on a the environment if there is a "reasonable probability" that it will it result in a

15 significant impact. No Oil, Inc, 13 Cal.3d at 83-84 n. 16. Substantial evidence is enough relevant

16 information and reasonable inference that a fair argument can be made to support a conclusion,

17 even though other conclusions. CEQA Guidelines § 15384(a). Substantial evidence includes

18 facts, reasonable assumptions predicated on facts, and expert opinions supported by facts. Pub.

19 Res. Code §§ 21080(e), 21082.2(c); CEQA Guidelines §§ 15064(f)(5), 15384. An agency must

20 prepare an EIR whenever it can be fairly argued by substantial evidence that a project may have a
21 significant environmental impact. If there is substantial evidence both for and against preparing

22 an EIR, then the agency must prepare the EIR.

23 38. CEQA provides categorical exemptions for projects that are unlikely to have

24 environmental impacts. Pub. Res. Code § 21084. These exemptions are to be construed narrowly

25 and are not to be expanded beyond the scope of their plain language. Castaic Lake Water Agency

26 V. City of Santa Clarita (1995) 41 Cal.App.4th 1257; Wildlife Alive v. Chickering (1976) 18

27 Cal.3d 190, 205. They must also be construed in light of their statutory authorization, which

28
-16-°

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

, limits such exemptions to classes of projects that have been determined not to have significant

2 effects on the environment - ensuring categorical exemptions are interpreted in a manner

3 affording the greatest environmental protection. See e.g., Azusa Land Reclamation Co. v. Main

4 San Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1165, 1192; Save our Schools v. Barstow

5 Unified Sch. Distr. Bd. of Educ. (2015) 240 Cal.App.4th 128, 140; County of Amador v. El

6 Dorado County Water Agency (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 966.

7 39. In keeping with this edict, CEQA also contains "exceptions-to-the-exemptions"

8 that require lead agencies to perform further environmental review whenever a project is subject

9 to one of these exceptions. CEQA Guidelines § 15300.2. Nor may a lead agency rely on

10 regulatory compliance measures or adopt de facto mitigation measures after preparation of a CE

11 when presented with substantial evidence of a potential environmental impact. Kings County

12 Farm Bureau v. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 716; Salmon Protection &

13 Watershed Network v. County of Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1102 (holding project must

14 be reviewed under CEQA when mitigation was required to avoid triggering sensitive

15 environment, significant impact, or cumulative impacts exceptions to the use of categorical
16 exemptions); Azusa Land Reclamation Co., 52 Cal.App.4th at 1200 (observing CEQA Guidelines
17 do not authorize consideration of mitigation measures with the categorical exemption and that the
18 project required at minimum an MND). In the context of noise, it is abundantly clear that an EIR
19 is required even if evidence shows a project will not generate noise in excess of an applicable

20 noise ordinance. Keep Our Mountains Quiet v. County of Santa Clara (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th
21 714, 732. Even an MND, a more demanding CEQA document than prepared here, requires

22 recirculated once additional mitigation measures have been adopted since the initial preparation

23 and circulation of the MND. Gentry v. Murrieta (1995) 36 Cal.App. 4th 1359, 1380.

24 40. Here, as fully set forth in the comments submitted by commenting parties,

25 Respondents were presented with substantial evidence demonstrating that the Project's Class 32

26 CE was improper including but not limited to incompatibility with applicable land use plans and

27 zoning requirements, aesthetics/shadow impacts, traffic, noise; all of which may be cumulatively

28 -17-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OP MANDATE

considerable when the Project Approvals are viewed as a precedent for future development of

2 similarly out-of-scale projects intruding in the core of residentially-zoned city-block in

3 Koreatown. Per Keep Our Mountains Quiet and Gentry, a fair argument exists that the Project

4 would have at minimum potentially significant noise inpacts, which in of itself required

5 Respondents' to prepare an MND or EIR. This meets the exception-to-the-exemption and

6 requires Respondents to prepare a more thorough CEQA review,

7 41. Alternatively, the Project satisfies the two-prong test to determine whether a

8 project presents "unusual circumstances" that require CEQA review beyond a CE. Berkeley

Q Hillside Preservation v. City of Berkeley (2015) 60 Cal.4th 1086. First, whether the project

10 presents an unusual circumstance and, second, whether there is a reasonable possibility that

11 significant environmental impact will result from that unusual circumstance. Id. at 1104. This
12 determination is subject to the fair argument standard. Id. at 1115. A finding that project will

13 have a significant impact, necessarily establishes some circumstance of the project is unusual and

14 that the exception applies. Id. at 1105; see also Walter v. City of Redondo Beach (2016) 1

15 Cal.App.5th 809, 820; Citizens for Envt'l Responsibility v. State of Cal. ex rel 14th Distr. Argric.
16 Ass'n (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 555, 573. Furthermore, when making an exemption determination,

17 an agency may not ignore evidence of an unusual circumstance creating a reasonable possibility

18 of a significant impact. Committee to Save the Hollywoodland Specific Plan v. City of Los

19 Angeles (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1168, 1187 (approval set aside where City failed to consider

20 proffered evidence regarding historical wall),

21 42. Here, both prongs are satisfied, First, this Project involves unusual circumstances

22 because of the Project seeks commercial use squarely limited to C2-properties along major

23 thoroughfares and surrounded by single- and two-story residential properties. Second, there is a

24 reasonable possibility that the Project will cause multiple environmental impacts requiring

25 analysis and mitigation under CEQA as discussed herein, including but not limited to: admitted

26 noise impacts, which APC imposed specific de facto mitigation measures; land use inconsistency

27 and the creation of a spot-zoning, as recognized in the Los Angeles CEQA Thresholds Guide;

28
-18-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

aesthetic/shadow impacts created by the out-of-scale development towering adjacent properties;

2 added traffic without analysis of impacts to unsignalized street segments; and the cumulative
impacts associated with each of these environmental resources.

4 43. Moreover, the failure to prepare a more thorough MND or EIR prevented the

5 public and responsible agencies from adequately vetting the Project's environmental review
including the adequacy of various environmental resources, such as air quality and GHG emission
impact determination, nor other resources and sections typically reviewed under an MND.

44. Here, Respondents failed to acknowledge that there was a fair argument of

0 potentially significant impacts despite being confronted with credible opinions on all of these

10 issues. Hence, Respondents failed to proceed in a manner required by law when it refused to

11 prepare an MND or EIR.

12 45. Petitioners have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy at law other than the relief

13 sought in this Petition. If Respondents persist in their refusal to rescind the Project Approval, and

14 if Respondents and Real Party are not enjoined or stayed from undertaking acts in furtherance of

15 the Project, Petitioners and the public will suffer irreparable harm from which there is no

16 adequate remedy at law in that the Project will be built, operations commence and significant

17 adverse impacts on the environment would occur, contrary to State and local law.

18 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

19 FAILURE TO ANALYZE ALL POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS; FINDINGS NOT BASED ON

21 46. Petitioners restate and reallege Paragraphs 1-45, as if fully set forth herein.

22 47. CEQA requires that a lead agency identify all potentially significant impacts of a

23 project. It further requires that the lead agency's findings must be based on substantial evidence.

24 Pub. Res. Code § 21082.2. Respondents failed to identify a number of potentially significant

25 impacts discussed above. Its findings that these impacts were not significant, and that they were

26 mitigated to a less than significant level, were not based on substantial evidence.

4 EVIDENCE (CEQA, PUB. RES. CODE $ 21000 ET SEQ.)

48.

49. Petitioners restate and reallege Paragraphs 1-47, as if fully set forth herein.

6 CEQA requires an agency to adopt feasible mitigation measures that will
substantially lessen or avoid the project's potentially significant impacts and to describe those
mitigation measures in the CEQA revièw document. Pub. Res. Code § 21081.6(b). This
obligation is typically not required in the context of a CEs, given projects typically approved

10 under CE are subject to minimal environmental review and lead agencies bare the burden that

11 "[i]f a reasonable argument is made to suggest a possibility that a project will cause a significant

12 environmental impact, the agency must refute that claim to a certainty before finding that the

13 exemption applies." Davidon Homes v. City of San Jose (1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 106, 117-118

14 (emphasis added). Petitioners need only make a "slight' showing of a reasonable possibility of a
significant environmental impact." Id.

15 50.

16 Here, Respondents not only failed to meet its burden but conceded that substantial

17 evidence demonstrated that the Project presented the potential for an environmental impact when

18 it adopted ten, Project-specific Conditions of Approval to mitigate construction/operational

19 impacts. This alone constitutes an admission by the City that the Project did not qualify for a CE a

RE: NOTICE OF INTENT TO FILE LAND USE/CEQA PETITION IN THE MATTER OF THE APPROVAL OF THE
DEWEY HOTEL PROJECT (966 S. DEWEY AVENUE; LOS ANGELES, CA 90006)

Dear Ms. Wolcott, Mr. Bertoni, and the Hon. City Attorney:

This is to inform you that Petitioners Nicholas Jimenez and unincorporated association
Koreatown for the Environment and Responsible Development (collectively "Petitioners") will be
filing suit against the City of Los Angeles ("City"), its Department of City Planning ("DCP"), and City Council ("Council") (collectively "Respondents") challenging DCP's approval of the hotel development located at 966 S. Dewey Avenue ("Project"), which includes the approval of various land use approvals under DCP Case No. ZA-2017-3446-VCU-CUB-ZAA-SPR ("Entitlements") and adoption of the Project's categorical exemption under DCP Case No. ENV-2017-3447-CE ("CE")
(collectively "Project Approvals").
As agents of the Respondents, please take notice, under Pub. Res. Code § 21167.5, that Petitioners allege that the Project Approvals violated the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), as well as various local and state zoning laws applicable to the Project. Specifically, Respondents use of a CE in lieu of a more comprehensive mitigated negative declaration or environmental impact report, failure to analyze all potentially significant environmental impacts or support its determinations with substantial evidence, and failure to consider adoption of additional feasible mitigation measures. While the CE approval has been timely appealed and currently pending City action, which Petitioners urge the Council to give thorough consideration and reserve all inherent authority to remedy CEQA defects including but not limited to vacating the Proiect's
Entitlements and preventing the Project from moving forward until defects have been cured the Entitlements were finally approved by DCP (via its Area Planning Commission) on May 30, 2018 and subject to no further appeals.

Ms. Wolcott, Mr. Bertoni, and Hon. City Attorney
August 27, 2018

land use laws and CEQA including preparation of an adequate CEQA document. 2. For a judgment enforcing the duty imposed upon Respondents by CEQA to prepare an adequate CEQA document that sufficiently addresses potential impacts to the environment in any subsequent action taken regarding the Project.
