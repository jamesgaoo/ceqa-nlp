Petition for Writ of Mandamus

1 Petitioners allege:

2 Introduction
3

4 1. The Willow Glen Trestle Conservancy and the Friends of the Willow

5 Glen Trestle bring this mandamus action in the public interest to prevent the

6 needless demolition of the evocative Willow Glen Trestle. The sole impediment to

7

8 demolition is a new and discretionary Streambed Alteration Agreement between the

9 City of San José and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW)

10 pursuant to Fish and Game Code section 1600 et seq. (aka the 1602 Agreement or

11 1603 Agreement). The Conservancy et al. contend that the California Environmental

12

13 Quality Act mandates supplemental environmental review that has not occurred.

14 The city has sought to demolish the Trestle since 2014, after prematurely

15 buying a steel replacement bridge for the Three Creeks Trail Pedestrian Bridge

16 Project. The city made a finding in 2014 that the Trestle is not historic, and approved
17

18 demolition based on a mitigated negative declaration.1 The State of California later

19 determined that the Trestle is historic, documented by its formal listing in the

20 California Register of Historical Resources in 2017. As a matter of law, demolition a
21

22 would thus cause significant impacts that must be avoided if feasible.

23 Because the project can be accomplished by rehabilitation of the Trestle rather

24 than demolition, the Conservancy remains dedicated to adaptive reuse. The Trestle's

25

26 1 The mitigated negative declaration was ultimately upheld by this Court in Santa
27 Clara County Superior Court case number CIV 489446, following the decision of the

28 Sixth District Court of Appeal in case number HO41563 and published in Friends of the Willow Glen Trestle v. City of San José (2017) 2 Cal.App.5th 457.

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 2

1. historic status is new information and a significant change in circumstances since the

2 2014 mitigated negative declaration. Because the Trestle is historic, any
3 discretionary new agency decisions that would allow demolition must be informed by
4

supplemental environmental review. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21084.1, 21166.)

6 Despite many requests, neither the city as lead agency nor CDFW as trustee
agency has prepared supplemental review and mitigation of the impacts to historic
8

9 resources that would result from the 1602 agreement. The Conservancy is informed

10 and believes that CDFW personnel have conducted some supplemental

11 environmental review as to fish and wildlife issues but did not address or mitigate
12 impacts to historic resources that they contend are not within their purview. The city
13

14 has not communicated why it continues to refuse to conduct supplemental review

15 before approving the 1602 agreement and continuing to pursue demolition.

28 The Willow Glen Trestle in 1955

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 3

1 CEQA is a citizen-enforced statute, and the Conservancy urgently seeks a

2 peremptory writ. To comply with CEQA, the city and CDFW must set aside their
3 approvals of the 1602 Agreement and reconsider approval only after preparing an
4

5 adequate supplemental environmental document that studies impacts to historic

6 resources and feasible alternatives to demolition of the evocative Willow Glen

7 Trestle. Because demolition would cause significant environmental impact, the
8

9 supplemental review must take the form of an environmental impact report. Since,

10 as it turns out, the city prepared an EIR in 2014, it need only update that document.

11

12 Jurisdiction

13 2. This Court has jurisdiction under Public Resources Code section 21168.5

14 and Code of Civil Procedure section 1085. The petitioner and the City of San José and
15

16 the Willow Glen Trestle, the subject of the 1602 Agreement with the California

17 Department of Fish and Wildlife, are located within the County of Santa Clara.

18

19 Parties

20 3. The Willow Glen Conservancy is an unincorporated association formed in

21 the public interest in 2018. The Conservancy is devoted to the preservation and
22 rehabilitation of the Willow Glen Trestle. The Conservancy's members include
23

24 community residents and concerned citizens who enjoy and appreciate the historic and

25 aesthetic qualities of the Willow Glen Trestle. The Conservancy brings this petition on

26 behalf of all others similarly situated too numerous to be named and brought before
27

28 this Court as petitioners. The Conservancy objected to the approval of the subject 1602

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 4

1 Agreement in light of significant environmental impacts attending demolition of the

2 Trestle, requested the preparation of an EIR, and exhausted administrative remedies.
3
4.
4 The Friends of the Willow Glen Trestle (Friends) is an unincorporated

5 association formed in the public interest in 2013. The Friends group is devoted to the

6 preservation and rehabilitation of the Willow Glen Trestle. The Friends' members
include community residents and concerned citizens who enjoy and appreciate the
historic and aesthetic qualities of the Willow Glen Trestle. The Friends bring this

10 petition on behalf of all others similarly situated too numerous to be named and

11 brought before this Court as petitioners. The Friends objected to the approval of the
12 subject 1602 agreement.
13

14 5. Respondent City of San José through its Department of Public Works is

15 the governmental body that approved the subject 1603 Agreement without conducting

16 supplemental environmental review of the Three Creeks Trail Bridge Project and the
17

18 proposed demolition of the Willow Glen Trestle.

19 6. Respondent California Department of Fish and Wildlife is the California

20 state agency charged with responsibilities for environmental protection under the Fish

21

22 and Game Code sections 1600 et. seq. and is a party to the 1603 agreement herein.

23 7. Does 1 through 10 are named as real parties in interest because there are

24 no private applicants who sought and received approval for the Bridge Project or for

25 demolition of the Willow Glen Trestle, and Does' true names and capacities are
26

27 currently unknown to petitioners. If true names and capacities become known,

28 petitioners will amend this petition to assert them.

8. The paragraphs below refer to and rely on information in documents

2 relating to this action, all of which will be filed with this Court as part of the record of
3 proceedings and are here incorporated by reference.

5 General Allegations

6

7 Willow Glen Trestle

8 9. The Willow Glen Trestle was built by Western Pacific Railroad when it was

9
a rival to the dominant Southern Pacific Railroad. Following World War I, when
10

11 Western Pacific was cash-strapped and looking for freight income it built the

12 undersized Willow Glen Trestle that forced trains to operate very slowly, under 10 miles

13 an hour. Its design and construction in 1921 reflected the unique conditions of a time
14

15 and place: the post-World War I materials' shortage, Western Pacific's economic

16 constraints, and the demand for quick service by new canneries in Willow Glen and

17 across San José.

18
10. For decades, the Southern Pacific (SP) railroad tracks had followed 4th
19

20 Street right through the center of San José. When that railroad's franchise expired at

21 the turn of the twentieth century, the city began pressuring SP to relocate its tracks. The

22 State Railroad Commission recommended that SP loop around the City and share

23 tracks with Western Pacific. However, because of the undersized design of the Trestle,
24

25 this was infeasible. SP built its own crossing of Los Gatos Creek - the bridge near San

26 Carlos Street that is still in use today.

27

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus

1 11. The Willow Glen Trestle was strong enough only to carry freight for trains

2 that ran "dead slow." This caused traffic congestion and led to the "grade separation"
3
movement and the eventual incorporation of the Town of Willow Glen.
4

5 12. It took some years for SP to build its tracks around San José, and in the

6 meantime Western Pacific served the area's many canneries. The route became Western

7 Pacific's "cash cow" and enabled the railroad to become profitable and expand its
8

9 Western Pacific had a network of lines traversing the Bay operations. By the 1930S,

10 Area eastward across the Sierras, providing an alternative to the SP monopoly.

11 13. If the Willow Glen Trestle had been just a "common trestle," Western
12 Pacific would not have developed a lucrative cannery business, SP's dominance would
13

14 likely have been unchallenged, and the Bay Area might have developed very differently.

15

16 Three Creeks Trail Pedestrian Bridge Project

17 14. For decades, the members of the Friends have been volunteering to benefit

18 the Los Gatos Creek Trail and Three Creeks Trail, and as part of that effort have worked
19

20 with city planners to incorporate the Willow Glen Trestle into the trail network. The

21 Friends provided information to planners and government officials about the Trestle

22 and railroad rights-of way, seeking grants so that the city could acquire them for the
23 Three Creeks Trail and its connection to the Los Gatos Creek Trail.
24

25 15. In January 2014, the city published an Initial Study and proposed a

26 mitigated negative declaration for a new Three Creeks Trail Pedestrian Bridge project,

27 including demolition of the city-owned Willow Glen Trestle and replacement with a
28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus

1 prefabricated single-span steel truss bridge on the same alignment, repurposing

2 rehabilitation grant monies. The City Council approved the project on January 14, 2014,

3 despite substantial expert evidence of the Trestle's historic status. Two members voted
4

5 against the mitigated negative declaration and against the project, expressing grave

6 concerns about the process followed to approve the demolition.

7 16. Following project approval, the Friends filed a mandamus petition seeking
8

9 preparation of an EIR. Following issuance of a writ, the mitigated negative declaration

10 was ultimately upheld by this Court in case number CIV 489446, following the reversal

11 by the Sixth District Court of Appeal in case number H041563 and published in Friends
12 of the Willow Glen Trestle v. City of San José (2017) 2 Cal.App.5th 457.
13

14 17. While the city's appeal was pending, it prepared and certified an EIR

15 addressing the demolition of the Trestle. The 2014 EIR analyzed the Trestle and

16 concluded that its rehabilitation for adaptive reuse as part of the trail project was

17

18 practical, safe, and economically feasible. However, the EIR also concluded that

19 demolition would have no significant environmental impacts since the Trestle is not

20 historic. The Friends did not file a legal challenge because under the Public Resources

21 Code challenges to the sufficiency of an EIR must be made after a project is approved in
22

23 reliance on that CEQA document. The city did not reconsider its approval of the Trestle

24 demolition project following certification of the EIR; it appeared that the reason the city

25 did not do so is that it would have made its appeal moot.

26

27

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 8

California Register Listing

18. While the legal cases were pending, the Friends successfully nominated the

4 Trestle to the California Register. The Trestle was listed in the Register in 2017.

5

6 Fish and Game Agreement

7 19. The Willow Glen Trestle spans Los Gatos Creek and its supports are in the

8 creek. The city's proposed removal of the Trestle as part of the Three Creeks Trail

10 Pedestrian Bridge Project requires work in the creek and therefore is subject to a

11 Streambed Alteration Agreement under a process delineated in Fish and Game Code

12 sections 1600 et seq. The city and CDFW entered into a discretionary 1602 agreement

13 in 2014 for the proposed demolition of the Trestle, which expired in late 2017.
14

20.
15 The city provided notification to CDFW regarding a new 1602 agreement in

16 March 2018. The original notification was incomplete and it was amended. CDFW then

17 provided a 1602 draft negotiated agreement to the city's Department of Public Works in
18 August and Director Michael O'Connell signed the agreement on behalf of the city on
19

20 August 7, 2018. The agreement recites that it will not become effective until "after

21 CDFW complies with all applicable requirements under the California Environmental

22 Quality Act (CEQA)."
23
21.
24 Counsel for CDFW agreed to give both the city and counsel for Friends and

25 the Conservancy at least two days notice of its decision as to whether CDFW would

26 conduct supplemental CEQA review to consider impacts to historic resources before

27 finalizing a 1602 agreement, as repeatedly requested by counsel for the Conservancy
28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 9

1 and the Friends. Notice was given to counsel on Monday afternoon, October 1, that*

2 CDFW would provide the signed agreement to the city on October 4 or 5, and that
3 CDFW was taking the position that protection of historic resources is not within its
4

5 purview and therefore will not be conducting CEQA review before finalizing the

6 agreement. Before that notice, the Conservancy continued to anticipate that CDFW

7 would acknowledge its duty to conduct CEQA review addressing the new significant
8

9 impact to historic resources.

10 22. The city has notified counsel for petitioners that in light of the recent notice

11 from CDFW that it will enter into the 1602 agreement, the city intends to proceed with

12 demolition forthwith.
13

14 23. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary

15 course of law. Issuance of a peremptory writ is needed to avoid immediate, severe, and

16 irreparable harm to San José residents and city resources via the demolition of the
17

18 Willow Glen Trestle. The city has the capacity to correct its violations of law but refuses

19 to do so.

20

21 Violations of the California Environmental Quality Act

22
24. Petitioners incorporate all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.
23

24 25. CDFG and the City abused their discretion and failed to act in the manner

25 required by law in entering into the discretionary Streambed Alteration Agreement that

26 is the final discretionary approval required prior to moving forward with the demolition
27

28 of the historic Willow Glen Trestle. Supplemental environmental review in the form of

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 10

1 an EIR is required prior to approval of the agreement under Public Resources Code

2 section 21166 because after the city's approval of the mitigated negative declaration in
3 2014 the Trestle was determined to be an historic resource by the State Historical
4

5 Resources Commission. Thus, there has been a substantial change in circumstances and

6 new information that requires major revisions in the CEQA analysis for the demolition

7 and consideration of feasible alternatives and mitigations.
8
26.
9 Although the 1602 agreement focuses on fish and wildlife issues attending

10 demolition of the Trestle, its discretionary provisions are the only prerequisite to

11 removal of the supports of the Trestle from Los Gatos Creek. It is that removal that will

12 accomplish demolition, with environmental impacts to historic resources that were not
13

14 subject to CEQA review in 2014. Those impacts are now subject to review and

15 mitigation. Recent CEQA decisions of the Supreme Court underscore agencies'

16 obligations to consider environmental impacts encompassed by CEQA even if not
17

18 within their particular statutory mandate.

19
Wherefore, petitioners request:
20

21 1. That the Court issue a peremptory writ of mandamus ordering respondents

22 to set aside and void approvals of the Streambed Alteration Agreement for the Three

23 Creek Trails Pedestrian Bridge Project and demolition of the Willow Glen Trestle and to
24

25 refrain from further consideration until full compliance with CEQA's supplemental

26 review mandates is achieved, including preparation and certification of an adequate

27

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 11

1 EIR and adoption of feasible mitigations and alternatives based on findings supported

2 by substantial evidence;

3
2.
4 That the Court issue a temporary restraining order and preliminary
s  injunction enjoining the respondents and their agents and employees from any and all

6 physical actions in furtherance of the Three Creek Trails Pedestrian Bridge Project or

7 that would physically alter the site or the Willow Glen Trestle while this petition is
8

9 pending, including but not limited to grading, demolition, pre-construction, or

10 construction activities of any kind;

11 3. For petitioners' costs and attorney fees per CCP section 1021.5; and

12
4. For such other and further relief as the Court finds proper.
