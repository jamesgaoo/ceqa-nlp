2 INTRODUCTION

3 1. Petitioner Ocean Street Extension Neighborhood Association (Petitioner) brings
4 this mandamus action in the public interest. Petitioner challenges the September 25, 2018,
5 approval by the City of Santa Cruz, by and through its City Council (collectively referred to
6 herein as "Respondents"), a Project at 1930 Ocean Street Extension (CP10-0033-APN 008-
7. 044-02) and certification of an associated Environmental Impact Report (EIR). The Project
8 consists of a Design and Planned Development Permits, a Tentative Map to construct an
9 apartment/condo development, a General Plan Amendment to change the land use designation
10 of a 2.74-acre parcel from L (Low Density Residential) to LM (Low Medium Density
11 Residential), and a Zoning Map Amendment to rezone the property from R1-10 (Single-Family
12 Residential) to RL (Multiple Residence - Low Density) (collectively "Project"). Because the
13 Zoning Map Amendment must be adopted by ordinance, Respondent City Council approved a
14 first reading of the ordinance for the Zoning Map Amendment on October 23, 2018. A second
15 reading of that ordinance must be adopted at a future meeting.
16 2. Despite the fact that the approvals for the Project are not final, the City filed
17 with the County Clerk a Notice of Determination pursuant to Public Resources Code section
18 21152. Said Notice of Determination starts 30-day statute of limitations. However, the
19 Notice should have been filed after final approval of the Project, which has not yet occurred.
20 Pub. Resources Code ยง 21152(a). Nevertheless, Petitioner filed this Petition for Writ of
21 Mandamus to avoid any argument that the Petition is untimely.
22 3. The Notice of Determination is also required to identify the Real Parties in
23 Interest pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21152(a) ("The notice shall identify the
24 person or persons in subdivision (b) or (c) of Section 21065, as reflected in the agency's record
25 of proceedings, and indicate the determination of the local agency whether the project will, or
โข26 will not, have a significant effect on the environment and shall indicate whether an
27 environmental impact report has been prepared pursuant to this division."). The City's Notice
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

2

of Determination does not comply with section 21152(a) since it does not identify the
2 applicants in this matter. The Fish & Wildlife fee form does list Craig Rowell and Richard
3 Moe as the applicants. However, the City's resolution approving the project identify Richard
4 Moe, Ruth Moe, Craig Rowell, and Corinda Ray as the applicants. After an inquiry with City
5 staff as to the status of applicant, staff responded that "Based on the [Land Use Application]
6 form, it appears Richard Moe and Craig Rowell are the applicants." Assurance that it
7 "appears" that Richard Moe and Craig Rowell are the applicants is inadequate since a
8 resolution approving the project lists other individuals. Therefore, these other individuals,
9 Ruth Moe and Corinda Ray, are also named as Real Parties in Interests.
10 4. Petitioner challenges the approval of the Project on the grounds that the Project
11 does not comply with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA--Pub. Resources
12 Code 21000 et seq.), because, inter alia, the Project Description, Project Objections and
13 Alternatives Analysis in the EIR are flawed, the EIR lacks a proper cumulative impacts
14 analysis, and the Final EIR fails to respond to many comments on the Draft EIR as required by
15 CEQA. The Petitioner also challenges the Project as not complying with California planning
16 and zoning laws because the Project approval violates the Municipal Code because
17 Respondents erroneously granted a variance from the requirements of the Municipal Code
18 through the Planned Development process. Therefore, Respondents' certification of the EIR
19 and approval of the Project constitutes an abuse of discretion and must be reversed.

14 petition on behalf of all others similarly situated that are too numerous to be named and
15 brought before this Court. Petitioner is an "aggrieved person" within the meaning of Public

13 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act
14 [Public Resources Code ยง 21000 et seq.]

15 21. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 20 as if fully

16 set forth herein.

17 22. Respondents' approval of the EIR constitutes an abuse of discretion because,

18 inter alia, the EIR's Project Description, Project Objectives, and Alternatives Analysis are
19

20 flawed the EIR lacks a proper cumulative impacts analysis, and the Final EIR fails to respond

21 to many comments on the Draft EIR as required by CEQA. The specific violations of CEQA

22 include, but are not limited to, the violations listed below.

23 23. The Project Objectives in the EIR were drawn too narrowly to facilitate the Real

24 Parties in Interests' desire for the proposed Project. In fact, the Project Objectives listed are a

25 complete ruse. The EIR lists six Project Objectives. Objective 6 simply states that the

26 objective is to build 40 units by developing homes in the "free market," without "subsidies,"

27 "while paying application fees," and "providing substantial off-site community improvements"

28 are not objectives. First, there can be no project without paying application fees or providing

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

6

1 necessary off-site community improvements. Both are required for any project, and the EIR
2 does not state that the developers are paying for any additional improvements that they are not
3 already obligated to provide. Application fees are simply required for any project.
4 Furthermore, the fact that the developers are not seeking subsidies and are selling market-rate
housing does not mean that these are Project Objectives. The Response to Comments never
6 address Petitioner's comments on this issue.
7 24. The EIR also states as an objective "to provide 40 affordable-by-design,
8 moderate cost housing opportunities per the Housing Element, Goal 2." However, Goal 2 calls
9 for providing and protecting "affordable housing to extremely low, very low, low, and
10 moderate income households." The goal is designed to protect and increase affordable as
11 defined by income levels, not the developer's own view of "affordable-by-design." The City's
12 General Plan defines "affordable housing" as:
13 Housing capable of being purchased or rented by a houschold with very low, low, or
14 moderate income, based on household's ability to make monthly payments necessary to obtain housing. Housing is considered affordable when a household pays less than
15 30 percent of its gross monthly income (GMI) for housing including utilities.

16

17 (2030 General Plan, p. 186.) Other than the inclusionary units which are required of any

18 project, the Project is a market rate project. There is no indication anywhere in the information

19 provided to the public that this will be an affordable housing project for "moderate income"
20 families. Moderate income has a specific definition. Indeed, objective 6 is "To develop new
21 housing opportunities in the free market... ." Thus, this Project is not an affordable housing 22

23 project. Even the Project Objectives are inconsistent.

24 25. The EIR also states as an objective "To provide housing opportunities to

25 persons with disabilities, per the Housing Element Goal 3." However, Goal 3 was intended to

26 provide Special Needs Housing to serve persons with physical and mental disabilities. This

27 Project is not designed specifically for the population intended to be served by Goal 3, and

28 does not provide "supportive services" for this population as called for in Goal 3.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

7

26. The EIR then cast the alternatives as not meeting all the Project Objectives. The
2 objectives are so narrowly tailored, and illusory, that viable alternatives become "infeasible" in
3 the EIR's analysis. The EIR concluded that Alternative 3 best meets Project Objectives. It is
4 clear, however, that Alternative has less impacts than Alternative 3. Alternative 1 has less
5 impacts for scenic resources and GHG emissions. The EIR states that Alternative 3 does not
6 meet objectives 1, 2 and 6, and that Alternative 2 does not meet objectives 1, 2, 4 and 6. Thus,
7 the EIR concludes that the only difference is objective 4. However, Objective 4 is to provide
8 new infill housing. This Project is not infill development as defined by the Respondents'
9 General Plan. Because of the illusory and narrowly tailored objectives, the Alternatives
10 Analysis is fatally flawed.
11 The purpose of an EIR is not to identify alleged alternatives that meet few if any of the
12 project's objectives so that these alleged alternatives may be readily eliminated. Since

13 the purpose of an alternatives analysis is to allow the decision maker to determine is whether there is an environmentally superior alternative that will meet most of the

14 project's objectives, the key to the selection of the range of alternatives is to identify alternatives that meet most of the project's objectives but have a reduced level of
15 environmental impacts.

16

17 Watsonville Pilots Assn. V. City of Watsonville (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1059, 1089. Thus, the

18 EIR violates CEQA.

19 27. The EIR dismisses the cumulative impact associated with the City's inadequate

20 water supply. The City claims that "The proposed project would result in a net increase in

21 water demand of approximately 2.0 MGY, which is not considered substantial in relation to the

22 estimated future demand in the City's water service area of approximately 3,200 MGY." The

23 EIR further states that:

24 The increase in water demand due to the proposed project would not substantially

25 exacerbate water supply reliability in the future or during a drought because the amount of additional demand when spread across all service area customers would not result in

26 any noticeable increase in the curtailment in customer use that would otherwise be
implemented during drought conditions... . Therefore, the project's incremental
27 contribution to a significant cumulative water supply impact would not be cumulatively considerable.
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

8

1 28. The EIR also dismisses the cumulative impacts related to two intersections
2 because "the project's contribution would be minor." Furthermore, the EIR also concludes
3 as follows:
4 The proposed project will contribute to significant cumulative traffic impacts at four
5 other locations in the project vicinity. Two intersections can be improved to an acceptable LOS: Ocean/Broadway and Ocean/San Lorenzo. The other two
6 intersections would continue to operate at unacceptable levels of service even with
7 improvements: Highway 1/Highway 9-River Street and Ocean Street/Water Street. Improvements for all intersections have been identified in the City's Traffic Impact Fee
8 (TIF) program. The project will be required to pay the City's traffic impact fee that is used for improvement of other intersections.' Payment of the TIF would mitigate the
9 project's contribution to significant cumulative traffic impacts at the other identified

10 intersections, except intersections (Ocean/Water and Highway 1/Highway 9) would continue to operate at unacceptable levels of service under cumulative conditions even
11 with identified improvements. The project's contribution to these intersections (less than 25 peak hour trips) would be minor and would not result in discernible changes to
12 delays or operations at these intersections. Therefore, the project's contribution to cumulative traffic impacts to these two intersections would not be cumulatively 13 considerable.

14

15 (Emphasis added.) The analysis in the EIR is contrary to the principles for analyzing

16 cumulative impacts. Traffic at identified intersections is already at an unacceptable Level of

17 Service. In an analogous case,
18 the significance of an activity depends upon the setting. (Guidelines ยง 15064, subd. ยง
19 (b)). The relevant question to be addressed in the EIR is not the relative amount of

20 precursors emitted by the project when compared with preexisting emissions, but
whether any additional amount of precursor emissions should be considered significant
21 in light of the serious nature of the ozone problems in this air basin.

22 Kings County Farm Bureau v. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 718. Here, the EIR

23 makes absurd and circular arguments that the Project's contribution to the problem is small,

24 thus, there is no cumulative impact. This violates CEQA because it minimizes the cumulative
25 impact of the Project. "Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively
26

27 significant projects taking place over a period of time." CEQA Guidelines ยง 15355. The City

28 cannot escape this analysis by simply asserting that the Project's contribution is small.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

9

1 29. Responses to Comments related to specific written comments on the Draft EIR
2 submitted failed to provide adequate responses. The responses were incomplete or
3 unresponsive. The evaluation and responses to public comments must contain good faith,
4 reasoned analysis. CEQA Guidelines ยง 15088(a), (c). Thus, the City's failure to properly
5 respond to comments on the EIR further constitutes a failure to proceed in a manner required
6 by CEQA.
7 30. The EIR concludes that the impact to the off-ramp is significant. It further
8 concludes that widening the off-ramp and installing a traffic signal will reduce the impact of
9

10 the Project on this off-ramp to less-than-significant level. Thus, it requires as a mitigation

11 that the applicant contribute to the improvements. However, the EIR also concludes that
12 "Although the improvement itself appears feasible, there is uncertainty as to whether it would

13 be ultimately accepted by Caltrans.' It also concludes that while the mitigation will reduce the
14 impact to a less-than-significant level, "due to uncertainty of funding and timing of
15

16 construction, it is conservatively concluded that the impact will remain significant and

17 unavoidable." The EIR also states that the project engineer would estimate the costs of the

18 widening and the signal, that fees would be collected at the time a building permit is issued,

19 and that the funds can be held by the City since the improvements are planned. However,

20 according to information obtained by members of the public from Caltrans, signalization of the
21 off-ramp is not feasible. According to Caltrans, the off-ramp is "too constrained for a signal.".
22

23 And, the EIR's "conservative" conclusion that the impact is significant and unavoidable due to

24 funding uncertainty does not save the analysis. The public is entitled to accurate information

25 to evaluate the impacts and the propriety of the Project. The fact that the EIR does not

26 investigate the feasibility of the mitigation is grave error. Environmental review is inadequate

27 when "it fails to provide sufficient evidence or analysis of the potential environmental effects

of the [Project]. "The agency should not be allowed to hide behind its own failure to gather
2 relevant data."* City of Redlands v. County of San Bernardino (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 398,
3
408.
4
31. Due to all the above flaws, Respondents' actions constitute an abuse of

6 discretion. Respondents must prepare an adequate EIR that conforms with all of the procedural

7 and substantive requirements set forth under CEQA. Approval of the EIR, which lacked both

8 procedural and substantive requirements under CEQA, constitutes an abuse of discretion.

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
11

12 Violation of California Planning and Zoning Laws

13 32. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 31 as if fully
14 set forth herein.

15 33. The slope regulations in the Municipal Code prohibit development within 20

16 feet of 30% slopes. Santa Cruz Municipal Code section 24.08-800 states emphatically that

17 slope regulation modifications are for unique situations "where strict compliance with Section

18 24.14.030, subsection (d) creates a particular physical hardship and where no reasonable

19 alternative to the exception exists... ." With a subdivision for 32 units, with a requested

20 General Plan and zoning change to allow more dense development, there is no physical

21 hardship and none could possibly be demonstrated in the form of a variance or exception,

22 which is limited by state law.

23 34. In anticipation of the limitations on granting an exception or variance pursuant
24 to the Municipal Code and state law, the EIR concluded that "City staff will review and make

25 findings as part of the Planned Development permit, as part of the PD request is to permit

26 development within 10 fect of 30 percent slopes; the project is not requesting : slope
27 modification or exception pursuant to sections 24.08.800-24.08-20 (sic) of the Municipal
28 Code." Respondent City Council approved the Planned Development permit. However,

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

11

1 Planned Development Regulations only allow variations to slope regulations "pursuant to
2 procedures set forth in Chapter 24.08, part 9 (Slope Regulations Modifications)." City
3 Municipal Code ยง 24.08.720. To make matters worse, Municipal Code section 24.14.030
4 states that "No new lot shall be created which will require the house to be sited within twenty
5 feet of a thirty-percent slope." This is a recognition that self-inflicted hardships are not
6 permitted. Thus, the Project violates the Municipal Code.

19 INJUNCTION

20 37. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 36 as if fully

21 set forth herein.

22 38. An actual controversy has arisen concerning Respondents' failure to comply

23 with CEQA (Pub. Resources Code ยง 21000 et seq.) and California planning and zoning laws,

24 as set forth above.

25 39. As a result of the above-alleged violations of CEQA and California planning

26 and zoning laws, Respondents have failed to conduct adequate environmental review as

27 required by law and, thus, have failed to proceed in a manner required by law in approving the

28 Project.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

12

40. At all times mentioned herein, Respondents have been able to comply with
2 CEQA, prepare adequate environmental review, and comply with all relevant provisions of
3 law, including California planning and zoning laws. Notwithstanding such ability,
4 Respondents have failed and continue to fail to perform their duty to comply with CEQA and
5 California planning and zoning laws.

6 41. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that Respondents
7 are threatening to proceed with development of the Project in the near future. Said

8 implementation of the Project will irreparably harm the environment and will result in

9 significant and unmitigated adverse environmental impacts.
10 42. Petitioners possess no speedy, adequate remedy at law, in that implementation
11 and development in connection with the Project will permanently and forever harm, injure,
12 degrade, and impact the environmental values of the City of Santa Cruz, the County of Santa
13 Cruz and the State of California. Petitioners will suffer irreparable and permanent injuries if
14 Respondents' actions described herein are not set aside.
15 43. A stay and/or restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunction
16 should issue restraining Respondents from proceeding with development of the Project.
17 44. In order to preserve the status quo, a stay and/or restraining order and
18 preliminary and permanent injunction should issue staying Respondents' approval of the
19 Project and certification of the EIR.

Re: Notice of Intent to Commence Litigation--1930 Ocean Street Extension CP10-0033 (APN 008-044-02)

Dear Mayor Terrazas and Members of the City Council:

Pursuant to the requirements of Public Resources Code Section 21167.5, this letter will
serve as notice that the Ocean Street Extension Neighborhood Association will commence litigation against the City of Santa Cruz and the City Council of the City of Santa Cruz.
The litigation challenges the City's approval of Project at 1930 Ocean Street Extension (CP10-0033- -APN 008-044-02) which includes Design and Planned Development Permits, a Tentative Map to construct an apartment/condo development, a General Plan Amendment to change the land use designation of a 2.74-acre parcel from L (Low Density Residential) to LM (Low Medium Density Residential), and a Zoning Map Amendment to rezone the property from R1-10 (Single-Family Residential) to RL (Multiple Residence - Low Density).
The litigation has been commenced because the actions listed in the preceding paragraph do not comply with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act, and California planning and zoning laws.

Very truly yours, WITTWER PARKIN LLP IUe William P. Parkin

Encl.
