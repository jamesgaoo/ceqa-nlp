INTRODUCTION 24

25 In this action petitioner SAVE THE CANYONS COALITION (the "Coalition" or "Petitioner")
26 challenges specific violations of law by respondents COUNTY OF ORANGE (the "County") and
27 ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ("Board") (County and Board are collectively
28 referred to herein as "Respondents"), as follows:

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 1. Petitioner challenges the decision of respondent Board, as the elected legislative

2 body for respondent County, to approve the application submitted by real parties in interest Red

3 Rock Chateau Wedding Center, Nabhan Simaan, Yola Simaan and James Miller (collectively

4 "RPIs") to develop the so-called "Red Rock [Wedding] Gardens" project (the "Project") in the
5 unincorporated community of Silverado, consisting of Planning Application PA080053 for Use

6 Permit to use an existing single-family dwelling on a 3.93-acre site (the "Site") for outdoor

7 special events (weddings, anniversaries, parties, and fund raisers) with live entertainment and

8 up to 20 event staff and 200 guests per event for a maximum of 12 events per year.

9 2. Petitioner contends that County's preparation of a mitigated negative declaration

10 ("MND") for the Project, and the Board's approval of that MND, violated specific provisions

11 of the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code § 21000, et seq.: "CEQA")

NOILVAOdHOO IVNOISSIJONJ V NNVW Y NOANHIDOW IIOHITT 12 and the Guidelines for Implementation of CEQA (Tit. 14, Cal. Code Regs., § 15000, et seq.: the

13 "CEQA Guidelines"), a statutory and regulatory framework commonly referred to as "the Holy
& 14 Grail of California's environmental laws."

15 3. Petitioner also contends that Respondents' approval of the Project violated specific

16 requirements of California's Planning and Zoning Law (Gov. Code § 65000, et seq.: the "PZL")
17 as well as the County's General Plan, Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan, and Zoning Code
18 because (among other things), County staff analyzed the Project and concluded it violated those

19 plans and County zoning yet Respondents chose to ignore staff's conclusions and the objections
20 of community residents and "spot zone" the Site in violation of the PZL.

21 4. Petitioner requests that this Court vacate and set aside the Project's and MND's

22 approvals by issuing a writ of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, directing

23 Respondents to vacate and set aside their approval of the Project and the MND.

24 JURISDICTION AND. VENUE

25 5. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to sections 187 and 1094.5

26 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and section 21168 of the Public Resources Code.

27 6. Venue for this action properly lies in the Orange County Superior Court because

28 Respondents and the Site are located in Orange County.

-2-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

PARTIES AND BENEFICIAL INTEREST 1

2 7. Petitioner is an unincorporated umbrella organization composed of and supported

3 by grassroots community groups, a non-profit 501(c)(3) environmental corporation, and others

4 devoted to the preservation of the environment. These three groups - the Saddleback Canyons

5 Conservancy, Rural Canyons Conservation Fund, and Friends of Harbors, Beaches and Parks,

6 Inc., were organized for the purpose of (among other things) representing the interests of the

7 public in assuring local compliance with California's environmental and land use laws.

8 Petitioner's members reside within the unincorporated Orange County communities in and
around Modjeska Canyon, Silverado Canyon and Santiago Canyon and/or own real property

10 within that area. On behalf of Petitioner's members, their respective constituents in the Canyon

11 communities, and other Orange County residents, Petitioner challenges Respondents' approval
NNVW 12 of the Project and adoption of the MND.
NOLIVHOdMOO IVNOISSHIONI V 14 interested in the issuance of the requested writ of mandate (i) because in accordance with 13 8. Petitioner has associational standing to bring this action a and is a party beneficially
dd
NOCNHIDOW CIOHIHT 15 subdivision (c) of Public Resources Code section 21177, Petitioner is an organization formed
16 after the approval of the Project to maintain an action against Respondents under CEQA, and
17 (ii) because certain members of Petitioner--including individuals who are members of the three
18| groups comprising Petitioner-complied with subdivisions (a) and (b) of Public Resources Code
19 section 21177, and exhausted their administrative remedies by timely commenting on and
20 objecting to the contents and adequacy of the MND and the Project both orally and in writing.
21 9. Unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate, the impacts resulting from
22 Respondents' decision to approve the Project and adopt the MND will extend to areas in which
23 numerous citizens represented by Petitioner live and will directly and adversely affect their
24 health and living environment, Consequently, Petitioner is directly and beneficially interested
25 in the issuance of the requested writ of mandate.

26 10. Respondent County is a public body, corporate and politic, organized and existing
under and by virtue of the laws of the State of California and is responsible for regulating and
28 controlling land use in all areas within unincorporated areas of the County, including (but not 27

-3-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

limited to) implementing and complying with the provisions of CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines,

2 the PZL, and the County's General Plan, Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan and Zoning Code.

11. Respondent Board is the duly constituted legislative body for Respondent County.

4 As such, Board is the governing body of County, and is responsible for carrying out County's

5 statutorily mandated duties, including (but not limited to) the formulation and implementation

6 of land use plans in the County and the preparation of CEQA documents for those plans.
12. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that real party in

8 interest Red Rock Chateau Wedding Center ("Wedding Center") is a business of unknown type
9 and a recipient of the approval that is the subject of this action since it was identified in County

10 staff reports, agendas, and other materials as the applicant for the Project's approvals.

11 13. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that real parties in
interest Nabhan Simaan and Yola Simaan (collectively, "Owners") are husband and wife who
NOILVJOdJOO IVNOISSHIONJ V NNVW  NOUNIIDOW IIOHIAT 12

13 own the Project Site at 17521 Santiago Canyon Road upon which they conduct a commercial
14 business under the fictitious names "Red Rock Chateau Wedding Center" and/or "Red Rock

15 Gardens" and are recipients of the approval that is the subject of this action.

16 14. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that real party in

17 interest James LeRoy Miller ("Miller"), acting as Owners' agent, is also a recipient of the

18 approval that is the subject of this action since he was identified in County staff reports, agendas,

19 and other materials as the applicant for the Project's approvals and therefore, in an abundance
20 of caution, Petitioner names him in this action.

21 15. Since Respondents did not publicly identify any other persons or entities as

22 recipients of the approval that is the subject of this action, Petitioner believes it has complied

23 with subdivision (a) of Public Resources Code section 21167.6.5.

24 16. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of the respondents named
25 herein as DOES 1 through 10, and the real parties in interest named herein as DOES 11 through

26 25, inclusive, and therefore sues those respondents and real parties in interest by such fictitious

27 names. Petitioner will amend this petition to allege the true names and capacities of those Doe

28 parties when ascertained. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that each

-4-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 of the parties designated herein as a Doe is responsible in some manner for the events and

2 actions referred to herein.

17. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that at all relevant
4 times the County, the Board, Wedding Center, Owners, Miller, and the Doe respondents and/or 3

5 real parties in interest were and are the agents of each other, authorized to do the acts herein

6 alleged, each of which was ratified by the others.

7 18. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, or otherwise of Does
through 25 are unknown to Petitioner who therefore sues Does 1 through 25 by such fictitious
9 names. Petitioner will amend this petition to allege the true names and capacities of the Doe 8

respondents when the same becomes known to it. Reference to "County," "Board," or
11 "Respondents" herein shall mean the named respondents and Does 1 through 10, and reference 10

12 to "Wedding Center," "Owners," "Miller," or "RPIs" shall mean the named real parties in NNVW 13 interest and Does 11 through 25.

14 19. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that Respondents, •d NOLIVHOdNOO IVNOISSHJONd V NOCNIIDOW MIOHITI 15 RPIs and each of the Does proximately caused the acts, omissions to act, and/or injuries herein
16 alleged.
17 ALLEGATIONS COMMON TO ALL CAUSES OF ACTION

20. The Site is located at the southern end of the Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan
19 area which is designated "Rural Residential." The Site is zoned "A1, General Agricultural" and 18

20 has a lawfully established single-family dwelling. Other Site improvements exist that have been
used for commercial weddings and receptions, including a dirt parking area and an indoor
22 reception facility. The Site is surrounded by open space uses. To the south of the Site is 21

23 Whiting Ranch Wilderness Park, and to the east across Santiago Canyon Road, along Gertner

24 Estate Road is other rural residential development.

26 Court to violating the County's Zoning Code by conducting commercial weddings at the Site 25 21. In 2000, the operators of Red Rock Chateau Wedding Center plead guilty in this

27 without proper zoning permits. Thereafter, the Owners sought permission for a project similar
28 to the Project-to conduct 35 commercial outdoor events on the Site-that the County

-5-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

designated as Use Permit Application PA000125, and on June 27, 2001, the County's Planning
2 Commission, by a vote of 4 to 0, denied the Owners' project based on its incompatibility to the
3 surrounding land uses, traffic generation, and other considerations.

4 22. On July 12, 2001, the Owners appealed the Planning Commission's denial to the
Board, and on September 25, 2001, the Board remanded the Owners' application to the Planning
6 Commission for reconsideration. On December 19,2001, the Planning Commission reaffirmed
its denial.

23.

9 Thereafter, in response to a second appeal, on March 19, 2002, the Board upheld
the Planning Commission's second denial, finding that it "[a]grees with the determination that

LEIBOLD McCLENDON MANN 10 the proposed use as a commercial wedding center is not compatible with the surrounding uses

11

12 and the A1 'General Agriculture'.

24.

13
& A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION 14 On September 18, 2003, the Owners filed an application for a commercial wedding
and events center that essentially duplicated its prior application excepting for reducing the

15 recommended denial of the Owners' application based on General Plan inconsistency, noise

16 number of events from 35 to 22. In its report dated May 4, 2005, County planning staff

17

18 impacts to residents and wildlife, traffic safety, conflicts with the Fire Code for a commercial

19 use for indoor activities, and septic system capacity. The Planning Commission then continued
the matter to a date uncertain, and the application was ultimately closed in 2008 due to inactivity.

25.

20

21 From 2000 through 2004, the Owners held wedding events on the Site under 16

22 Temporary Use Permits ("TUPs") issued by the County, but from 2005 through late 2015, the

23 County revoked further granting of TUPs for wedding events due to code violations occurring
on the Site, nonconformance with the Zoning Code related to the commercial activities occurring

25 on the Site, and lack of resolution of noise, fire protection, and traffic control. In November of
24 2015, the County reinstated the Owner's access to TUPs, but they did not thereafter seek any.
26. The Planning Commission considered the Project at its September 27, 2017,
26 meeting. County planning staff recommended denial of the Project based on staff's analysis that
27 the Project was inconsistent with the County's General Plan, Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan

28 and zoning for the Site. At the meeting, the Planning Commission received the staff report and

-6-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 public testimony from interested members of the public and continued the item, directing staff

2 to circulate the MND and return with additional information on fire and traffic safety.

3 27. At the Planning Commission's December 13, 2017 meeting, County planning staff
reported back that the MND had been circulated, provided the public comments received related

5 to the MND, and furnished the requested traffic and fire related impact and mitigation
6 information. The Planning Commission continued the Project a second time to its January 24,
N 2018 meeting with directions to staff to reach out to RPIs to discuss the option of a General Plan
8 Amendment for the Project.
9 28. On January 10, 2018, County planning staff met with the applicant's
10 representatives via conference call to outline the General Plan amendment process as it would
11 apply to the Project.

NNVW 12 29. At the January 24, 2018, Planning Commission meeting planning staff reported
13 to the Planning Commission on the results of the discussion with Wedding Center, Owners,
d
LEIBOLD McCLENDON NOIIVHOdHOO IVNOISSHJONJ V 14 Miller, and their environmental consultant. Following the discussion, the Planning Commission
15 voted to adopt the MND and approve PA080053, subject to certain findings and conditions of
16 approval, which included a reduction in the number of events allowed per year from 20 to 12,
17 and RPIs agreed to this reduction.
18 30. On February 6, 2018, the Saddleback Canyons Conservancy and Rural Canyons
19 Conservation Fund jointly filed an appeal to the January 24, 2018, Planning Commission
20 approval of the Project and adoption of the MND, raising the following issues: (1) the Project
21 is not consistent with the County's General Plan; (2) the Project is not consistent with the
22 Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan; (3) the Project is not consistent with the County's Zoning
23 Code; (4) in approving the Project, the Planning Commission improperly granted a defacto
24  zoning variance; and (5) the Project's approval violated CEQA.

25 31. On February 7, 2018, the Inter-Canyon League filed an appeal to the January 24,
26 2018, Planning Commission approval and adoption of the MND and raised the following issues:
27 (1) commercial land use is inconsistent with the General Plan; (2) commercial land use is
28 inconsistent with the Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan; (3) commercial land use is inconsistent

-7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1

2 with the County's Zoning Code; (4) additional traffic from the events would make the road even

4 more dangerous than it is currently; (5) CEQA requirements are not met; and (6) the Planning
3 Commission abused its discretion by interpreting words to mean the opposite, placing a higher

5

6 value on a commercial use compared to other neighbors' use of their neighborhood and granting

32.

7 a reduced number of events with the intent of granting more at a later date.

8 Thereafter, County planning staff's, recognizing that the Board's rejection of the

9 appeals and affirmation of the Planning Commission's decision would likely result in litigation

10 against the County, on April 6, 2018, the County's Deputy Director of Development Services/

11 Planning signed an indemnification agreement in which Nabhan Simaan agreed, at his own

MANN 12 expense, to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the County in any action brought against it "to
attack, set aside, void or annul any approval of the Project."
33.

13
è A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION LEIBOLD McCLENDON 14 On April 10, 2018, the Board conducted a public hearing on the Project at which

15 time many persons again spoke in opposition to the Project. After receiving extensive testimony,
and in complete disregard of widespread community opposition to the Project and County

17 Counsel and planning staff cautioning the Board that the Project was inconsistent with the
16 County's General Plan, Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan and Zoning Code, the Board approved

18 the Project and adopted the MND.

34.

20 On April 12, 2018, the County filed and posted a Notice of Determination of the
19 Board's adoption of the MND for the Project, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.

21 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

22 35. (AGAINST RESPONDENTS) PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

23 A. Petitioner realleges paragraphs 1 through 34.

24 VIOLATION OF THE PZL

36.

26 Respondents are, and at all times relevant herein have been, charged by law with
25 the performance of all duties arising under the PZL, including faithfully implementing the PZL's

27 legislative limitations and mandates imposed on the land use decisions of cities and counties.

37. Despite the Site being located in the County's lowest intensity residential land use
28 designation-the 1A "Rural Residential"zone-and despite County staff expressly cautioning

-8-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

that commercial uses such as the Project are not permitted in that zone, the Planning
2 Commission and Board nevertheless approved the Project.

38. In approving the Project, Respondents violated the PZL's anti-spot zoning
"uniformity requirement," i.e., Government Code section 65852. As explained in Neighbors in

6 Government Code section 65852 is

7 Support of Appropriate Land Use v. County of Tuolumne (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 997,

8

9 "like an enforcement clause, allowing parties to the [comprehensive

10 zoning plan] contract to challenge burdens unfairly imposed on
them or benefits conferred on others. According to a leading

11 treatise, section 65852 'is intended to prevent unreasonable

LEIBOLD McCLENDON & MANN & 12
A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION 13 discrimination against or benefit to particular properties within a
given zone.' (4 Manaster & Selmi, Cal. Environmental Law and

14 Land Use, supra, Zoning, § 60.70, p. 60-114.3 (rel. 45-9/06)].)"
(Id. at p. 1009; emphasis added.)
15 B.

16 VIOLATION OF THE COUNTY'S GENERAL PLAN

39. "The Legislature has mandated that every county and city must adopt a
17 *comprehensive, long-term general plan for the physical development of the county or city, and
18

19 of any land outside its boundaries which in the planning agency's judgment bears relation to its

20 land use and development depends upon consistency with the applicable general plan and its

21 planning.' (Gov. Code, § 65300.) [] '[T]he propriety of virtually any local decision affecting

22 40.

23 elements." (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 570.)
"Although use permits are not explicitly made subject to a general plan meeting a
the requirement of state law, that condition is necessarily to be implied from the hierarchical
24 relationship of land use laws. Thus, use permits are struck from the mold of the zoning law, the
25 zoning law must comply with the adopted general plan, and the adopted general plan must
26 conform with state law; the validity of the permit process derives from compliance with this
27 hierarchy of planning laws (Neighborhood Action Group v. County of Calaveras (1984) 156
28 Cal.App.3d 1176).

-9-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

I 41. County planning staff's September 27, 2017 report to the Planning Commission

2 provided "[a] detailed analysis of the [Project's] land use consistency with the Orange County

3 General Plan, Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan and Zoning Code." The report concluded that

4 "The proposed project is not consistent with the 1A land use designation because it proposes a

5 commercial use in a designation intended for low density single-family residential development."
6 Explaining this conclusion, the report further noted that,

7 "The 1A residential land category does not allow for

8 neighborhood/convenience commercial sites as described:
9 Neighborhood/convenience commercial sites are assumed to

10 be consistent with 1B 'Suburban Residential' designated

11 areas, subject to the Neighborhood Commercial guidelines

NNVW  NOUNHIOOW IIOHIHT 12 contained herein. These sites are not identified on the Land
A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION 13 Use Map. Source: Land Use Element, Revised October

14 2015, page III-10

15 Because the site is designated 1A 'Rural Residential' and not 1B

16 'Suburban Residential', the proposed commercial use is not

17 consistent and could not be established under the General Plan.

18 Additionally, the use as proposed is intended to serve more than just

19 the local area and it would not be considered neighborhood/

20 convenience commercial."

21 42. In a section "Inconsistency with Adjacent Land Use Designations," the report

22 noted:

23 "The land adjacent to the project site within the County

24 unincorporated area is also designated as 1A "Rural Residential".

25 The land adjacent to the southern project site boundary is

26 designated by the City of Lake Forest General Plan as Regional

27 Park/Open Space. Establishing a commercial land use would not be

28 compatible with the adjacent General Plan land use designations."

-10-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

43. The staff report summarized its findings as follows: "The proposed project is not
2 consistent with the 1A "Rural Residential" Land Use Designation, nor is it consistent with the
3 neighborhood/convenience commercial sites location criteria. Also, a commercial project of this
4 nature is not consistent with the adjacent General Plan land use designations."

44. As noted above, the Land Use Element of the County's General Plan designates
6 the Project site as 1A, "Rural Residential," which allows residential land uses only and does not 5

7 allow the commercial uses such as the Project.

8 "This category is applied to areas in which limited residential use
9 is compatible with the natural character of the terrain. Development
10 under this category will require special consideration due to
11 topography and other factors. The building intensity standard for
12 Rural Residential ranges from 0.025 to 0.5 dwelling units per gross NNVW 13 acre (DU/AC)."
dd NOILVHOdNOO IVNOISSHJONd V 15 makes explicit allowance for specific commercial uses under other designations, it does not do 14 (Orange County General Plan, Land Use Element, page III-12.) While the Land Use Element NOCNETOOW CIOEIIT 16 so for the Project's 1A designation.

17 45. Respondents' approval of the Project violates state law requiring that all
18 development be consistent with a county's adopted general plan.

19 C. VIOLATION OF THE COUNTY'S SILVERADO-MODJESKA SPECIFIC PLAN

20 46. At one time, County officials believed that because the Silverado-Modjeska
21 Specific Plan area was adopted in 1977 by resolution instead of by ordinance, development
22 within the plan's area did not have to comply with it. However, in 2016, Petitioner provided the
a 23 County with a legal analysis on this issue, and since that time the County has taken the position
24 that development with the Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan area must be consistent with it. A
25 true and correct copy of the 2016 legal analysis is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.
In keeping with County planning staff's position regarding the applicability of the
27 Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan, staff's September 27, 2017 report to the Planning 26 47.

28 Commission noted that:

-11-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1

2 "Claims have been made that the Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan

3 is not an enforceable document as it is a policy level document,

* 1n o M however this is not the case and all projects in the specific plan area
must be consistent with the specific plan. This is similar to a
General Plan which is also a policy level document and all
development must be consistent with the general plan in order to

8 48. make the necessary findings as defined in the zoning code."

9 In comparing the Project to the Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan, County

10 planning staff concluded that the Project was "not consistent with the Rural Residential Land

11 Use Designation of the General Plan and Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan, and is not consistent

MANN 12 with the Scenic Highway Overlay."

49.

& A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION The Site lies within the boundaries of the Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan, which

LEIBOLD McCLENDON 13 designates it as Rural Residential. The Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan states that commercial

14

15 facilities are only allowed in existing commercial sites and "shall not be allowed in any

16 residential category in this plan."

50.

17 In addition, the Project Site lies within the Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan's

18 Scenic Highway Overlay, in which the plan explicitly prohibits commercial land uses.

19 "Neighborhood Commercial sites will not be allowed within the scenic highway corridor."

51.

20 Further, the Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan implements the County's General

21 Plan within the Project area, pursuant to state law: "After the legislative body has adopted a
general plan, the planning agency may, or if so directed by the legislative body, shall, prepare
22 specific plans for the systematic implementation of the general plan for all or part of the area

23 covered by the general plan." (Gov. Code § 65450.) The County's General Plan explicitly
24 makes the implementing Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan mandatory:

25

26 "TRANSITION AREAS FOR RURAL COMMUNITIES

27 New development within the Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan

28 planning area shall be rural in character and shall comply with the

-12-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 policies of that plan in order to maintain a buffer between urban

2 development and the Cleveland National Forest."
3 (Orange County General Plan, Growth Management Element, Policy 6.) Thus, the Project's
4 inconsistency with the Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan constitutes inconsistency with the

5 General Plan and Respondents violated the PZL by approving the Project.

6 D. VIOLATION OF THE COUNTY'S ZONING ORDINANCE

7 52. "To obtain a use permit, the applicant must generally show that the contemplated

8 use is compatible with the policies in terms of the zoning ordinances, and that such use would
9 be essential or desirable to the public convenience or welfare, and will not impair the integrity
10 and of the zone district or be detrimental to the public health, safety, morals or welfare."

11 (O'Hagen v. Board of Zoning Adjustment (1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 151.)
12 53. In determining whether the Project was consistent with the County's Zoning Code, NNVW NOIIVHOdNOO IVNOISSHIONI V 13 County planning staff found the Project inconsistent in three significant ways:
dd 14 "Zoning Code Consistency Analysis NOCNHIOO IIOHIAT The subject site is cated within the A1 "General Agricultural" zone; the 15

16 Codified Ordinances of Orange County define the purpose and intent of the A1

a 19 recreational uses, and those low-intensity uses which have
20 predominately open space character. It is also intended that this

21 district may be used as an interim zone in those areas which the
may designate for more intensive urban uses in the 22 General Plan

23 future. Source: Zoning Code Section 7-9-55.1

which have a predominately open space character are intended uses of this zone. 27

28 The use as proposed (i.e. weddings, large events) does not promote agriculture as

-13-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 a significant function of the property, is not typically associated with an outdoor

2 recreational use as defined in the Zoning Code or Silverado-Modjeska Specific

3 Plan, and is a high-intensity use as it relates to traffic and noise generation.

4 Inconsistency with the Permitted Uses of the "A1" Zoning District The proposed

5 use is not consistent with the Permitted Uses of the "A1" Zoning District. The

6 most similar permitted use would be "Commercial Outdoor Recreation", which

7 is defined as providing "amusement, pleasure, or sport" for purposes of financial

8 gain. As proposed, the use is not typically associated with recreational outdoor use

9 and is not an activity that furthers the enjoyment of the natural surroundings.
10 Additionally, the use does not operate in the fashion where the event facility is
11 ancillary use to the primary permitted use such as agriculture.

NNVW 12 Inconsistency with the Commercial Outdoor Recreation Zoning Definition
NOILVAOdãOO IVNOISSHdOdJ V 13 The proposed use is not consistent with the definition of "Commercial Outdoor
8 14 Recreation". Again, the proposed use is not typically associated with LEIBOLD McCLENDON 15 "amusement, pleasure, or sport". Furthermore, restaurants, night clubs, and
16 cocktail lounges are discouraged under this definition. Food service/catering,

17 dancing, and alcohol service are all functions of weddings and similar events,

18 thus, the proposed use does not meet the definition of Commercial Outdoor

19 Recreation.

20 Summary

21 The proposed Red Rock Wedding Gardens is not consistent with the purpose and

22 intent of the "A1" Zoning District, is not consistent with the permitted uses of the

23 "A1" Zoning District, and is not consistent with the definition of Commercial

24 Outdoor Recreation."

25 54. County planning staff also compared the Project to on previously approved-

26 Giracci Vineyards-and found the two readily distinguishable, with the Project being located

27 in the 1A Rural Residential zone, and Giracci Vineyards located in the 1B Suburban Residential

28 zone.

-14-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

55. Section 65860 of PZL requires all zoning to be consistent with the adopted general
2 plan. Thus, by finding the Project was consistent with the County's Zoning Code and approving

3 it, Respondents violated the PZL and the Zoning Code and improperly granted the Project a
4 de facto zoning variance.

5 E. VIOLATION OF CEQA AND THE CEQA GUIDELINES

6 56. CEQA applies to all "governmental agencies at all levels" and requires public

effects or impacts on the environment. Respondents' decision to approve the Project was a 7 agencies to prepare an EIR whenever the approval of a project may cause significant adverse

8

9 project approval causing significant adverse environmental impacts.

57. CEQA requires lead agencies to review the environmental impacts of all projects.
11 Under Public Resources Code Section 21065, a project is any discretionary public "activity 10

which may cause either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foresecable NNVW NOIIVHOdHOD IVNOISSHJONJ V 13 indirect physical change in the environment." Respondents' decision to approve the Project was 12

8 14 a discretionary decision by Respondent that will result in "reasonably foreseeable" adverse NOINHIOOW UIOHIHT A "significant effect on the environment" means a substantial, or potentially 15 environmental impacts.

17 substantial, adverse change in any of the physical conditions within the area affected by the 16 58.

18 project including land, air, water, minerals, flora, fauna, ambient noise, and objects of historic

19 or aesthetic significance. The Project's potential impact to the community required the
20 preparation of an EIR. For example, Respondents approved the Project despite being presented

22 inconsistent with the County's General Plan, the Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan, and the 21 with expert opinion and substantial evidence from their own planning staff that the Project was

23 Zoning Code, as well as fair arguments supported by substantial evidence that the Project would
24 lead to environmental impacts that would not be mitigated to a level of insignificance. Thus,
25 subdivision (g) of CEQA Guidelines section 15064, required the preparation of an EIR.
26 59. In order for an EIR to be legally adequate, it must comport with certain
27 requirements set forth in CEQA and the Guidelines. For example, CEQA and the CEQA
28| Guidelines require that an EIR include a description of the Project and a discussion of

-15-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

alternatives to the Project, including (but not limited to) the "no project" alternative and

2 alternative methods of accomplishing some, but perhaps not all, of the proposed Project's

3 objectives. However, Respondents did not proceed in the manner required by law in that it failed

4 to cause an EIR to be prepared that adequately discussed a reasonable range of alternatives to

5 the proposed Project, thereby eliminating a meaningful basis for comparing the adverse

6 environmental impacts of the proposed Project to environmentally superior alternatives.

7 60. Respondent further did not proceed in the manner required by law in that it caused

8 a MND to be produced that was biased in favor of the proposed Project's approval and,

9 therefore, failed to constitute the full disclosure document intended to objectively inform

10 decision-makers and the public of the Project's true impacts, mitigation measures, and

11 alternatives. For example, the MND failed to honestly address basic deficiencies in the Initial

8 NNVW  NOINIIOOW IIOHIHT 12 Study's Land Use analysis and further concerns including: Traffic and Traffic Safety Impacts;
NOILVHOdHOD IVNOISSHJONJ V 13 Noise Impacts; Impacts on Air, Water Quality and Wildlife; and Exposure to Hazardous
14 Materials and Fire Hazard.

15 61. Respondents further did not proceed in the manner required by law in that their

16 finding that the MND satisfied the requirements mandated by CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines

17 constitutes an abuse of discretion in that Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required
18 by law and their decision is not supported by substantial evidence.

19 62. CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines require that the lead agency make certain written

20 findings and that those findings must be supported by substantial evidence in the record.

21 Respondents did not proceed in the manner required by law, however, because in connection

22 with the Board's approval of the Project's land use entitlement-a use permit-neither the

23 County's Planning Commission nor the Board adopted findings that refuted fair arguments

24 supported by substantial evidence that the Project was inconsistent with every applicable County

25 land use plan and zoning code and thus result in potentially significant environmental impacts.

26 63. CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines require that Respondents adopt feasible

27 mitigation measures to avoid significant environmental impacts. Respondents did not proceed

28 in the manner required by law in that the MND failed to adequately examine and discuss
-16-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

potential mitigation measures that would substantially lessen the Project's reasonably foresceable
2 adverse impacts to the surrounding community.

3 64. CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines require that Respondents analyze (among other
4 impacts) Traffic and Traffic Safety Impacts; Noise Impacts; Impacts on Air, Water Quality and

5 Wildlife; and Exposure to Hazardous Materials and Fire Hazard. Respondents were provided

6 with fair arguments supported by substantial evidence that the above impacts were not fully

7 mitigated. Nevertheless, Respondents approved the insufficient MND.

8 F. PROPRIETY OF RELIEF

9 65. The decision of Respondents to approve the Project and adopt the MND
10 constitutes a final decision as contemplated in Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and an

11 "approval" as defined in CEQA Guidelines section 15352.

66. Respondents have the legal duty in making their determinations to comply with
NOLIVMOdHOO IVNOISSHJOHd V NNVW NOANIIOOW IIOHIHT 12

13 the applicable laws and regulations governing such acts. In particular, Respondents have the
& 14 legal and nondiscretionary duty to act in accordance with the requirements of CEQA, the CEQA
15 Guidelines, the PZL, County plans and ordinances, and other applicable laws and regulations.
16 67. Respondents acted arbitrarily, capriciously, irrationally, and unreasonably, and
17 without any or an adequate evidentiary basis in failing or refusing to comply with the
18 requirements of CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, the PZL, County plans and ordinances, and other

19 applicable laws and regulations.

20 68. At all times material hereto, Respondents had, and continue to have, the ability to

21 comply with their legal duties and obligations. Respondents have failed and refused to perform
22 those duties and obligations notwithstanding the substantial evidence presented by Petitioner and
23 others that such failures and refusals are contrary to law and regulations and will have adverse
24 consequences on Petitioner, its members, and those residing in the surrounding community.

25 69. In acting and failing to act in the manner described above, Respondents have
26 prejudicially abused their discretion by approving a legally inadequate MND and approving the
27 Project, in violation of Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 et seq.

CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION

To: Inter-Canyon League, Saddleback Canyons Conservancy, Rural Canyons Conservation Fund and Canyon Lands Conservation Fund

From: John G. McClendon

Re: Analysis of the Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan

Date: June 21, 2016

INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY CONCLUSION

In response to your request, I have reviewed the Silverado-Modjeska Specific Plan (hereinafter, the "Sil-Mod Specific Plan"), the County of Orange ("County") Zoning Code and other materials in light of the California Planning and Zoning Law (Gov. Code § 65000 et seq.) and relevant case law in order to try and answer the following two questions:

Is the Sil-Mod Specific Plan in force and binding in light of the
County having adopted it by resolution?

If its adoption by resolution is irrelevant, then to what degree is the Sil-Mod Specific Plan in force and binding?
In the Analysis below, I conclude that the Sil-Mod Specific Plan is not rendered ineffectual on account of it having been adopted by resolution and that its provisions are sufficiently "fundamental, mandatory and clear" for the County and the courts to enforce them. Before getting to that Analysis, however, I believe the following overview of relevant law pertaining to general and specific plans will be helpful in setting the context for these documents and
understanding why I reached those conclusions.

Iam providing this to you as a privileged confidential attorney-client communication. However, you are the holders of that privilege and therefore have the right to waive it if you sO desire. In my opinion, believe the County would benefit from having this information.

THE EVOLUTION OF STATE LAW CONSTRAINTS ON
LOCAL LAND USE REGULATION AND THE GENERAL PLAN

The "police power" to protect the public's health, safety and welfare provides the
broad legal basis upon which California counties and cities regulate land use within their jurisdictions. The source of those police powers derives not from delegation of authority by the State but from the common law as well as Article XI, section 7 of the California Constitution which provides that, "[a] county or city may make and enforce within its limits all local, police, sanitary, and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws." (DeVita v. County of Napa (1995) 9 Cal.4th 763, 782.)
At one time, California laws limiting local land use police powers were minimal. For example, while state statutes providing for the adoption of general plans have been around since 1927, they were permissive in nature, and a general plan was viewed as merely an idealistic statement of policy which might or might not be carried out' [citation omitted]; it was 'in reality an interesting study without much direct relevance to day-to-day activity.? " (City of Santa Ana v. City of Garden Grove (1979) 100 Cal.App.3d 521, 532.)
However, in 1971, the Legislature significantly altered the status of the general plan by mandating that zoning and subdivision approvals had to be consistent with a city's or county's general plan. (DeVita v. County of Napa, supra, 9 Cal.4th at p. 772.) A year later, the Legislature enacted urgency legislation to clarify that "consistent with" could only be determined ift jurisdiction had "officially adopted" a general plan. (58 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 21, 23-24 (1975).) With these enactments, the general plan became "a constitution for all future development" within a jurisdiction and the single most important planning document
governing Cal.3d 531, 540; Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553,
570-571.) its land use. (Id.; Lesher Communications, Inc. V. City of Walnut Creek (1990) 52

By law, a general plan must be "a comprehensive, long-term general plan for the physical development of the county or city, and of any land outside its boundaries it determines bears a relation to its planning." (Gov. Code § 65300.) It must "consist of a statement of development policies" and include diagrams and text setting forth "objectives, principles, standards, and plan proposals." (Gov. Code § 65302.) And all general plans must
also include:
• • a land use element
a circulation element
a housing element

LEIBOLD MCCLENDON & MANN, P.C.
Analysis of the Silverado-Modjeseka Specific Plan
June 21, 2016
Page

a conservation element
an open-space element
a noise element
a safety element

(Id.) As will be seen, these seven elements are relevant to the Sil-Mod Specific Plan. A general plan is required to be adopted by resolution. (Gov. Code § 65356.)

THE SPECIFIC PLAN

One step below the general plan in the land use approval hierarchy, and used for systematically implementing the general plan in a specific geographical area, is the specific plan. Once a county or city has adopted a general plan, it "may ... prepare specific plans for the systematic implementation of the general plan for all or part of the area covered by the general plan." (Gov. Code § 65450.) Similar to the way a general plan must include certain elements, a specific plan must include, by text and diagram, the following:

(1) The distribution, location, and extent of the uses of land, including open space, within the area covered by the
plan.

(2) The proposed distribution, location, and extent and intensity of major components of public and private
transportation, sewage, water, drainage, solid waste disposal, energy, and other essential facilities proposed to be located within the area covered by the plan and needed to support the land uses described in the plan.

(3) Standards and criteria by which development will
proceed, and standards for the conservation,
development, and utilization of natural resources, where
applicable.

(4) A program of implementation measures including regulations, programs, public works projects, and financing measures necessary to carry out paragraphs (1), (2), and (3).

LEIBOLD MCCLENDON & MANN, P.C. Analysis of the Silverado-Modjeseka Specific Plan
June 21, 2016
Page 4

(Gov. Code § 65451.) A specific plan must also include a statement of the relationship of the specific plan to the general plan. (Id.) Other subjects may be included if, in the judgment of the county or city, they "are necessary or desirable for implementation of the general plan." (Gov. Code § 65452.)
Unlike a general plan, which must be adopted by resolution [Gov. Code § 65356], a § specific plan may be adopted either by resolution or by ordinance. (Gov. Code § 65453.) Based on the information and documents I have been provided, this is apparently a key point with the County and will be addressed below. However, whether it was adopted by resolution or ordinance, since a specific plan is a legislative act, it is subject to adoption or repeal by voter initiative. (Yost v. Thomas (1984) 36 Cal.3d 561, Midway Orchards V. County of Butte (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 765, De Vita v. County of Napa, supra.)
A specific plan cannot be adopted unless it is consistent with the general plan. (Gov. Code § 65454.) Once adopted, all zoning ordinances within the area covered by the specific plan must then be consistent with it.2 (Gov. Code 65455.) Notably, similar to the way principles of statutory construction operate (i.e., the more specific trumps the more general), the specific plan for an area controls over the jurisdiction's general plan such that the general plan and its less specific policies may not be applicable to the specific plan area. (Markley V. City Council (1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 656, 668.)

2 reviewed the PowerPoint that County Public Works Development Services presented at an Inter-Canyon League meeting on April 5, 2016, in which the County apparently claimed the Sil-Mod Specific Plan was hierarchically inferior to County Zoning Code regulations
on account of it having been adopted by resolution and "Specific Plans adopted by resolution do not supersede regulations contained in Zoning Code or Zoning Map." What with specific plans systematically implementing generals plan and Government Code section 65455 mandating that "no zoning ordinance may be adopted or amended with an area covered by a specific plan unless it is consistent with the adopted specific plan," the claim is perplexing and appears have it backwards:

A zoning ordinance that is inconsistent with the general plan is invalid when passed [citations] and one that was originally consistent
but has become inconsistent must be brought into conformity with the
general plan. (§ 65860.) The Planning and Zoning Law does not contemplate that general plans will be amended to conform to zoning ordinances. The tail does not wag the dog.
(Lesher Communications, Inc. V. City of Walnut Creek, supra, 52 Cal.3d at p. 541; emphasis added.)

ANALYSIS

In the first section of this Analysis, address whether the Sil-Mod Specific Plan is in force and binding in light of the County having adopted it by resolution. Concluding that the Sil-Mod Specific Plan's adoption by resolution is irrelevant, in the second section of this Analysis I explore the extent to which the County and the courts may enforce it.
DOES THE SIL-MOD SPECIFIC PLAN LACK ANY "TEETH" AS A
LAND USE CONTROL DOCUMENT ON ACCOUNT OF THE COUNTY
HAVING ADOPTING IT BY RESOLUTION INSTEAD OF ORDINANCE?

Based on information you provided, it appears the County views the Sil-Mod Specific Plan as essentially having no value as to the "systematic implementation of the general plan" for those areas covered by it [Gov Code § 65450] and believes its "standards and criteria by which development will proceed" [Gov. Code § 65451] are unenforceable on account of the County having adopted it by resolution and not by ordinance. After researching this issue, believe the County's incorrect view is probably predicated on one (or more) of three factors.

The first factor may be a large body of case law noting that ordinances and resolutions are different. Typical of this is Central Manufacturing District, Inc. v. Board of Supervisors (1960) 176 Cal.App.2d 850, 860, where the court noted the difference by quoting 35 California Jurisprudence 2d, § 392, p. 200:

An ordinance in its primary and usual sense means a local law. It prescribes a rule of conduct prospective in operation, applicable generally to persons and things subject to the jurisprudence of the city. "Resolution denotes something less formal. It is the mere expression of the opinion of the legislative body concerning some administrative matter for the disposition
of which it provides.

In the specific context of a county ordinance versus resolution, another court explained:
We cannot in good conscience say that "ordinance" means the same thing as "resolution" in light of the well-established differences between the two modes of enacting legislation.

"The resolution of board of supervisors is ordinarily not equivalent to an ordinance. A resolution is usually a mere declaration with respect to future purpose or proceedings of the board. An ordinance is a local law which is adopted with all the
legal formality of a statute.' [citations] A resolution adopted without the 'formality' required of an ordinance cannot be
deemed an ordinance. [citation] A duly enacted county ordinance is a 'law of this State' within the meaning of a penal statute proscribing the violation of such law [citation]; a board resolution is not.

"The Legislature has been explicit concerning this distinction.
It has exacted certain 'formalities' in the enactment of an
ordinance by the supervisors of a county ([Gov. Code,] §§ 25120-25121), but not of their adoption of a resolution. It has specified certain requirements relative to the publication of a county ordinance after its passage ([Gov. Code,] §§ 50021, 25124), its deferred effective date in the typical case ([Gov. Code,] § 25123), its mandatory recording in an 'ordinance book' ([Gov. Code,] §§ 25102, subd. (b), 25122); compare [Gov. Code,] § 25102.1, as to the recording of resolutions, and the
codification of ordinances generally ([Gov. Code,] §§ 25126-
25130, 50022.2- 50022.5); none of these requirements apply to board resolutions. By statute, the Legislature has made the terms 'ordinance' and 'resolution' synonymous in a very few instances, each of which is highly specialized and applies to a
city only (Gov. Code, 60004; Sts. & Hy. Code, §§ 8007, 8305); in innumerable other statutes authorizing or directing actions by county boards of supervisors, it has been careful to state whether the specific action shall be taken by 'ordinance' or by 'resolution' in each case. It has emphasized the distinction
between the two terms by further providing that, when a statute requires local legislative action by resolution but a local charter requires that it be taken by ordinance, 'action by ordinance is compliance with the statute for all purposes (§ 50020); it has made no converse statutory provision to the effect that a 'resolution' will suffice, where a statute requires action by
'ordinance,' under any circumstances.

"Because the difference between a 'resolution' and an 'ordinance' is thus substantive, under case law and by deliberate legislative definition, the one .. cannot be construed as having amounted to the other (City of Sausalito v. County of Marin (1970) 12 Cal.App.3d 550, 565-566 [90 Cal.Rptr. 843], fn. omitted.)

(Midway Orchards v. County of Butte (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 765, 774-775 [269 Cal.Rptr. 796].)

The second factor may arise from The Planner's Guide to Specific Plans,3 published by the Governor's Office of Planning and Research in 2001, taking the foregoing case law differentiating ordinances and resolutions, combining it with the Legislature's enactment of Government Code section 65453 allowing specific plans to be adopted either by ordinance or resolution, and concluding from it that counties and cities can henceforth adopt either a "full strength" specific plan or a "specific plan lite" depending on whether they do SO by ordinance or resolution:

Adoption Options: Unlike the general plan, which must be adopted by resolution
(§65356), two options are available for the adoption of a specific
plan: Adoption by resolution or adoption by ordinance. An ordinance is a local statute, enforceable by law. According to Black's Law Dictionary, the term "resolution" "…is usually
employed to denote the adoption of a motion, the subject matter
of which would not properly constitute a statute... . Such is not law but merely a form in which a legislative body expresses an opinion."

The choice between the two is dependent upon the role which
the plan is intended to fill. When adoption is by resolution, the
specific plan becomes a policy document similar to the general plan. It takes the form of a more specific set of policies which may give direction to the mix of land uses or goals of a particular development. When adoption is by ordinance, the specific plan effectively becomes a set of zoning regulations that

provide specific direction to the type and intensity of uses permitted or defines other types of design criteria including architectural standards. However, it is important to note that as in City of Sausalito V. County of Marin, (1970) 12 Cal.App.3d 550, 565, the adoption of plans which effectively rezone property must be completed by ordinance consistent with §65850. The enactment of specific plan is a legislative act subject to adoption or repeal by voter initiative even when enacted by resolution (Yost v. Thomas (1984) 36 Cal. 3d 561, Midway Orchards v. County of Butte (1990) 220 Cal. App. 3d 765, De Vita v. County of Napa, (1995) 9 Cal. 4th 763).

(Id. at p. 26.)
Specific plans may differ in their implementation of the general plan depending upon whether they are adopted by resolution or by ordinance. A specific plan adopted by resolution will propose implementation measures, whereas a specific plan adopted by ordinance imposes regulations. If the specific plan is regulatory by design, the plan's regulations must promote the general plan's statement of development policies. In particular, the regulations must be enactments resulting from and complying with the directives of the general plan's policies, plan proposals, or action programs.

(Id. at p. 29.)
The third factor derives directly from the first factor and is the County's enactment, on October 1, 1980, of Ordinance No. 3218 adding the following provisions to Title 7 [*Land Use and Building Regulations"], Division 9 ['Planning"], Article 2 ["Comprehensive Zoning Code"] of the County's Code of Ordinances:
Sec. 7-9-156. - Specific plans.

The provisions of sections 7-9-156 through 7-9-156.3 shall be known as the Specific Plan Procedures. All references to this section shall include sections 7-9-156.1 through 7-9-156.3.

When deemed to be necessary for the orderly implementation of the General Plan and when deemed to be in the public interest
the Board of Supervisors may adopt a specific plan by ordinance or by resolution.
* * *

Sec. 7-9-156.1. - Specific plan resolution.

When a specific plan is intended to provide clarification and specific information with regard to the policies and concepts expressed within the General Plan, but not to provide the
regulations necessary for implementation, such specific plan may be adopted by resolution of the Board of Supervisors.

(a) Contents of plan: A specific plan resolution may include all of the details, concepts and programs deemed
necessary to ensure common understanding and implementation of the General Plan as applicable to the
area and the issues covered by the specific plan. It shall
include such direction and provisions deemed necessary to provide for the implementation of the General Plan.

(b) Regulations excluded: A specific plan resolution
shall not include regulations and requirements for imple-
mentation of the General Plan, and any specific plan which contains such implementation regulations shall not be adopted by resolution.

Sec. 7-9-156.2. - Specific plan ordinance.

Regulations within a specific plan shall be adopted by the Board
of Supervisors by ordinance. Such plan may either supplement
or supersede all land use regulations applicable to the subject
property, including all previously adopted ordinances, standards and guidelines deemed to be necessary for the orderly and systematic implementation of the General Plan.

LEIBOLD MCCLENDON & MANN, P.C.
Analysis of the Silverado-Modjeseka Specific Plan June 21, 2016
Page 10

(a) Scope of plan: Bach specific plan ordinance shall include such regulatory texts and maps necessary to provide the regulations for the development, maintenance and use of the subject real property in compliance with the policies and programs of the General Plan. Bach plan shall specify clearly how and to what extent such plan is to supplement or supersede any adopted ordinances, regulations and standards. Where not otherwise addressed by a specific plan, all currently adopted ordinances, regulations and standards of the County of Orange are applicable.

(b) Coordination with others: When a specific plan
ordinance is intended to include items and issues that are
not within the normal purview of the Planning Agency,
the preparer of the plan shall consult with such persons and organizations deemed appropriate to ensure orderly implementation of the specific plan.

(c) Designation on zoning map: Adoption of a specific plan ordinance shall also include adoption of an appropriate zoning district map. The zoning district map shall not indicate zoning for the area within the specific plan but shall show the letter S within a circle.
Thereafter, all land use, development and improvements shall conform to the provisions of the adopted specific
plan.

Assuming for the sake of argument that all of the foregoing three factors are valid, none of them justify the County treating the Sil-Mod Specific Plan as an unenforceable land use document on account of it having been adopted by resolution instead of ordinance. Taking the three factors in reverse order, Sections 7-9-156, 7-9-156.1 and 7-9-156.2 are entirely inapplicable to the original Sil-Mod Specific Plan. The County adopted the Sil-Mod Specific Plan in 1977, and adopted Sections 7-9-156, 7-9-156.1 and 7-9-156.2 in 1980, and have not come across anything indicating that, at the time the County adopted those three Sections, it intended for them to apply retroactively to specific plans previously approved by

LEIBOLD MCCLENDON & MANN, P.C.
Analysis of the Silverado-Modjeseka Specific Plan June 21, 2016
Page 11

the County. Thus, under established principles of statutory construction, those three Sections do not apply to the original Sil-Mod Specific Plan.4

Generally, statutes operate prospectively only. In the words of section 3 of California's Civil Code : "No part of [this code] is retroactive, unless expressly so declared." (Italics added.) ... In the words of the United States Supreme Court, "the "principle that the legal effect of conduct should ordinarily be assessed under the law that existed when the conduct took place has timeless and universal appeal.' " [citation]
As the United States Supreme Court has consistently stressed, the presumption that legislation operates prospectively rather than retroactively is rooted in constitutional principles ... Just as federal courts apply the time-honored legal presumption that
statutes operate prospectively "unless Congress has clearly
manifested its intent to the contrary" [citation], so too California
courts comply with the legal principle that unless there is an
"express retroactivity provision, a statute will not be applied
retroactively unless it is very clear from extrinsic sources that the Legislature…. must have intended a retroactive application"
(Myers v. Philip Morris Companies, Inc. (2002) 28 Cal.4th 828, 840-841; see also USS-Posco Industries v. Case (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 197, 216 ["The general rule is that absent a clear, contrary indication of legislative intent, we interpret statutes to apply prospectively. ... we presume they do not apply retroactively unless the Legislature has said otherwise expressly or unmistakably."].)

The second factor is inapplicable for a similar reason. The Legislature enacted Government Code section 65853 in 1984seven years after the County adopted the Sil-Mod Specific Plan. Prior to that, the assumption was since the law said a specific plan was "for the systematic implementation of the general plan" with "standards and criteria by which development will proceed" within their boundaries,' specific plans were to be adopted in the same manner as general plans: by resolution. Thus, while the Governor's Office of Planning and Research concluded the "by resolution or by ordinance" language in Government Code

The five subsequent amendments to the Sil-Mod Specific Plan, all of which the County adopted by resolutions between 1981 and 1985, would fall under Section 7-9-156.1.

Page 12

section 65453 ushered in the ability to adopt two different types of specific plans, section 65453 has no bearing on the original Sil-Mod Specific Plan even ifthat conclusion is correct.
The first factor-case law drawing distinction between ordinances and resolutions-
is also irrelevant to the Sil-Mod Specific Plan. Whereas in 1970 the court in City of Sausalito V. County of Marin, (1970) 12 Cal.App.3d 550, 565-567, made much of the fact that "[a] resolution of a board of supervisors is ordinarily not equivalent to an ordinance," the following year the California Supreme Court took the opposite tack:
Associated complains that although subdivision (b) of section 11546 requires that a city's ordinance set forth the standard for determining the amount of land to be declared or fee to be paid by a subdivider, ordinance 10-1.516 contains no such standard. It provides instead that the standards shall be set forth by resolution; it is resolution 2225 rather than the ordinance which
specifies these matters. There is no showing in the record as to the circumstances under which the resolution was adopted.

It has been held that even where a statute requires the
municipality to act by ordinance if a resolution is passed in the manner and with the statutory formality required in the enactment of an ordinance, it will be binding and effective as
an ordinance. (Central Manufacturing District, Inc. v. Board of Supervisors (1960) 176 Cal.App.2d 850, 860 [1 Cal.Rptr. 733].) Since there is no showing in the record as to the circumstances under which the resolution was adopted, we
presume its validity.
(Associated Home Builders etc., Inc. v. City of Walnut Creek (1971) 4 Cal.3d 633, 647-648; emphasis added, italics in original.) Notably, the appellate opinion the Supreme Court approvingly cited here makes salient what the law was at the time the County adopted the Sil-Mod Specific Plan, citing another Supreme Court (Crowe v. Boyle) case from 1920:
The difference between an ordinance and a resolution is well
stated in 35 California Jurisprudence 2d, section 392, page 200:
"The enactments of a city's legislative branch are known as
ordinances and resolutions. Strictly speaking, there is a
difference between the two. An ordinance in its primary and

LEIBOLD MCCLENDON & MANN, P.C.
Analysis of the Silverado-Modjeseka Specific Plan June 21, 2016
Page 13

usual sense means a local law. It prescribes a rule of conduct prospective in operation, applicable generally to persons and things subject to the jurisdiction of the city. 'Resolution'
denotes something less formal. It is the mere expression of the opinion of the legislative body concerning some administrative matter for the disposition of which it provides. Ordinarily it is of a temporary character, while an ordinance prescribes a permanent rule of conduct or of government. However, for
many purposes the two words are equivalent terms." See also
37 American Jurisprudence, section 142, page 755.
Crowe v. Boyle, 184 Cal. 117, 149 [193 P. 111]: "But in the absence of statutory or charter provision to the contrary, a legislative act may be either in the form of a resolution or of an ordinance. [Citations.]

For many purposes resolutions and ordinances are equivalent
terms. [Citations.]

"And it has been held that even where the statute or municipal charter requires the municipality to act by ordinance, if a resolution is passed in the manner and with the statutory formality required in the enactment of an ordinance, it will be
binding and effective as an ordinance.

(Central Mfg. Dist., Inc. V. Board of Supervisors (1960) 176 Cal.App.2d 850, 859-860; emphasis added.) As noted above, the adoption of a specific plan is a legislative act. (Yost V. Thomas (1984) 36 Cal.3d 561.) And at the time the County adopted the original Sil-Mod Specific Plan in 1977, the Legislature had not yet specified the manner in which specific plans were to be enacted. Thus, the enactment of the Sil-Mod Specific Plan by resolution does not make its provisions any less enforceable than the enactment of the County's General Plan by resolution. The adoption and amendment of both are legislative acts.

ASSUMING THE SIL-MOD SPECIFIC PLAN HAS
"TEETH," EXACTLY HOW SHARP ARE THEY?

Even if the County's adoption of the original Sil-Mod Specific Plan by resolution does not undermine its utility as a land use document regulating the areas it covers, that still leaves

LEIBOLD MCCLENDON & MANN, P.C. Analysis of the Silverado-Modjeseka Specific Plan June 21, 2016
Page 14

open the question of whether those standards and regulations must be honored and enforced by the County and the courts, and conversely, whether a disgruntled developer could successfully sue the County if the County used those standards and regulations as the basis to limit or deny that developer's proposed project. Answering this question requires the threshold recognition that all provisions of a general or specific plan are not created equal.
Government Code section 65040.2 requires the Governor's Office of Planning and Research to develop and adopt guidelines for the preparation of general plans and directs that those guidelines "shall be advisory to each city and county in order to provide assistance in preparing and maintaining their respective general plans." Although not mandatory, as "the state's only official document explaining California's legal requirements for general plans" and that "closely adheres to statute and case law," for more than 40 years the State of California General Plan Guidelines' have been the general plan bible for cities and counties, with courts periodically referencing them for assistance in determining compliance with planning law. (Corona-Norco Unified School Dist., supra, at p. 994, fn. 6.)
The General Plan Guidelines explain that the various terms used in general and specific plans are not interchangeable but have discreet, formal and specific meanings:

Goal A goal is a general direction-setter. It is an ideal future end related to the public health, safety, or general welfare. A goal is a general expression of community values and, therefore, may be abstract in nature. Consequently, a goal is generally not
quantifiable or time-dependent.' ***

Objective An objective is a specified end, condition, or state that is an intermediate step toward attaining a goal. It should be achievable and, when possible, measurable and time-specific. An objective may pertain to one particular aspect of a goal or it may be one of several successive steps toward goal achievement. Consequently, there may be more than one
objective for each goal. ***

Policy
A policy is a specific statement that guides decision-making. It indicates a commitment of the local legislative body to a particular course of action. A policy is based on and helps
implement a general plan's objectives."
***

Standards
A standard is a rule or measure establishing level of quality or
quantity that must be complied with or satisfied. Standards define the abstract terms of objectives and policies with concrete
specifications. (Id.)

Thus, a "goal" is subjective and not quantifiable, "standards" are objective, qualifiable and quantifiable, and a "policy" falls in the middle and just below "standards."
Recognizing the differences in general and specific plan terms gives insight into the question of whether the Sil-Mod Specific Plan's standards and regulations are of the type that the County can legally enforce against developers and a court can compel the County to comply with if it fails to do so. Case law holds that the closer the "specific statement" of general or specific plan "policy" comes to resembling an objective "standard," the more
inclined courts will be to require compliance with it.

In fact, a line of cases extending back more than thirty years holds a proposed project can be found to be inconsistent with & general or specific plan if it conflicts with just a single policy requirement. For example, in California Native Plant Society v. City of Rancho Cordova (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 603 ["Native Plant"], the city's general plan directed the city to design mitigation for certain wildlife species "in coordination with" the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the California Department of Fish and Game. (Id., at p. 635.) Opponents of the project argued that the city did not coordinate with the Fish and Wildlife Service because the city approved the project over the Fish and Wildlife Service's repeated objections that the proposed biological resource mitigation measures were inadequate. (Id., at p. 641.) The city interpreted "coordination" to mean trying to work with someone else and as being synonymous with "consultation." (Id.) The court rejected this interpretation as unreasonable under the particular circumstances and concluded that "coordination" required
a measure of cooperation. (Id.) Based on that definition, the court determined that the city's approval of the project was inconsistent with the general plan's coordination requirement and
thus violated the Planning and Zoning Law. (Id., at p. 642.)

LEIBOLD MCCLENDON & MANN, P.C. Analysis of the Silverado-Modjeseka Specific Plan June 21, 2016
Page 16

Native Plant approvingly cited Endangered Habitats League, Inc. v. County of Orange (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 777, 782 ['"EHL"], where our local appellate court reiterated that "[a] project is inconsistent if it conflicts with a general plan policy that is fundamental, mandatory, and clear." (Native Plant at p. 637.) Like the court in Native Plant, in EHL the court confronted a situation where a project was inconsistent not with a plan's permissive goals or guidelines but with the plan's specific and mandatory regulations applicable to traffic on Santiago Canyon Road. Noting that "[c]onsistency requires more than incantation, and a county cannot articulate a policy in its general plan and then approve a conflicting project," ." the court rejected the County's consistency finding because the project was inconsistent with unambiguous and mandatory general plan policies. (EHL, at pp. 787-789.) The EHL court then distinguished Corona-Norco Unified School Dist., supra, where "the general plan did not contain any specific, mandatory requirement." (Id. at pp. 789-790.)
EHL followed from Families Unafraid to Uphold Rural etc. County V. Board of Supervisors (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1341 ["FUTURE "], where the court rejected the argument that "simply one general plan policy should not be enough to scuttle a project." Again distinguishing Corona-Norco Unified School Dist., and noting that "the nature of the policy and the nature of the inconsistency are the critical factors to consider," the FUTURE court rejected a county's a determination that a proposed project was consistent with the general plan because the project violated a single policy in the general plan's land use element that was fundamental, mandatory and "anything but amorphous." (Id.)
In turn, FUTURE followed from San Bernardino Valley Audubon Society, Inc. V. County of San Bernardino (1984) 155 Cal. App. 3d 738, 753, where the court affirmed the lower court's rejection of the county's general plan consistency finding for a project because the project was inconsistent with a single general plan policy. "Policy C4-a5 of the conservation element of the [c]ounty's general plan" - was a mitigation measure hardwired into the general plan that "require[d] the protection of beneficial, rare or endangered animals and plants with limited or specialized habitats."* (Id.)
Applying the foregoing case law to the Sil-Mod Specific Plan leads to the conclusion that if any of the Sil-Mod Specific Plan's policies are "fundamental, mandatory, and clear" then the County can legally enforce them and a court could compel the County to comply with them if it fails to do so. With Government Code section 65451 saying specific plans "must" include "[s/tandards and criteria by which development will proceed, and standards for the conservation, development, and utilization of natural resources, where applicable" and "[a] program of implementation measures including regulations," one would reasonably expect to find such clear-cut policies in the Sil-Mod Specific Plan. (Emphasis added.)

A review of the Sil-Mod Specific Plan shows it "establishing a level of quality or quantity that must be complied with or satisfied" and defining "the abstract terms of [County General Plan] objectives and policies with concrete specifications." As noted above, such objective, qualifiable and quantifiable rules are "Standards" according to the General Plan Guidelines that must be complied with. The following are just a few a examples of the Sil-Mod Specific Plan's standards for development:

LAND USE

General Development Guidelines (p. 1)

It is the intent of the county to promote subdivision and construction that will least disturb the natural contours and
vegetation. All cut and fill banks shall be finished to harmonize
with the existing topography. Abrupt changes of graded areas are to be avoided, rounding all edges into the natural topography and planting with appropriate vegetation. In no event will any development be allowed to proceed if the tentative plans submitted indicate high cut and fill banks that will destroy the beauty and integrity of the natural terrain and vegetation.
The following guidelines shall apply to all residential and recreational development in the Silverado-Modjeska area. Only in cases where the public safety and welfare are issues, and/or
where site conditions dictate design which better fits the goals and policies of the Specific Plan will one or more of these development guidelines be exempted.

1. Building pads and their access to a public street shall be
located and designed in a manner which preserves the natural landscape.

a. For any grading activity, the vertical height of any
cut shall not exceed 10 feet, and the vertical
height of any fill shall not exceed 10 feet. For graded roads the vertical height of any cut and/or fill shall not exceed 10 feet wherever feasible.

LEIBOLD MCCLENDON & MANN, P.C. Analysis of the Silverado-Modjeseka Specific Plan June 21, 2016
Page 18

b. Landscape screening will obscure grading scars
from view of any public road.

C. No grading will occur on slopes exceeding 45 percent except for fuel breaks and community-
wide emergency access routes.

2. All lots shall, be so designed that surface drainage
from the lot will be drained directly to its own
street frontage, approved natural water course, or improved easement with a minimum of control
devices.

CONSERVATION
***

Tree Preservation (p. 6)
Trees exceeding five inches in diameter will be preserved or replaced in conjunction with any grading or construction activity. In situations where development necessitates tree removal, the county may require tree planting (appropriate species of any size) and maintenance (watering as necessary) on the subject property or public right of way on a one-for-one
basis.

CIRCULATION

Rural Road Character (p. 8)

Curbs, gutters, sidewalks and street lights shall not be allowed
unless necessary for safety purposes.

SCENIC HIGHWAY
***

Site Plan Review (p. 9)
***

3. There are to be no paved sidewalks along public roads.
***

LEIBOLD MCCLENDON & MANN, P.C.

Page 19

5. Parking lot roadway, walkway and security lighting
fixtures are not to project above the roof line of any
building and are to be shielded in a manner which
minimizes their reflection onto adjacent property and
public roads.

Moreover, it should be noted that the Sil-Mod Specific Plan includes all seven mandatory general plan elements, validating its stated purpose of amplifying the County's General Plan policies. Comparing these clarifications, interpretations and details to the General Plan Guidelines' definition of a "standard," they are more than just policies-they are objective standards-and as such they appear to be sufficiently "fundamental, mandatory and clear" to compel their enforcement.
In summary, it should come as no surprise that the Sil-Mod Specific Plan describes itself as a policy document with real land use regulatory "teeth" to it:

It is a policy document for the defined areas of Modjeska Canyon, Williams Canyon, Silverado Canyon, Baker Canyon, and Black Star Canyon. Although not a part of the Orange County General Plan, the specific plan clarifies, interprets and details many general plan policies with specific reference to the conditions of the Silverado-Modjeska area.°
(Id.; emphasis added.) To the extent the County or anyone else is either seeing tooth decay or no teeth at all in the Sil-Mod Specific Plan,7 I would suggest they take a closer look.

6 In the 2013 unpublished opinion styled Save Our Specific Plan v. County of Orange [Chad Kearns] (4th Civ. Case No. G046416) our local appellate court incorrectly stated that the Sil- Mod's purpose was "to ensure the preservation of the rural environmental and lifestyle of the area while providing for reasonable development." According to the Sil-Mod Specific Plan [p. ii] this
was the purpose of the "Foothill Corridor Policy Plan" that preceded the Sil-Mod Specific Plan.

7 Notably, in Save Our Specific Plan the court found the County's own actions refuted its position:
"Although appellants argue the county did not find the [Sil-Mod] Specific Plan requires compliance with its terms in the present matter and has repeatedly taken that position in this case, the county has amended the specific plan on at least three prior occasions when it
apparently found a project would conflict with the specific plan.'

action against the County of Orange and Orange County Board of Supervisors to set aside its approval of the "Red Rock Gardens" project (PA080053: the "Project") proposed for development by Nabhan and Yola Simaan. The litigation will challenge (among other things) the approval of the mitigated negative declaration prepared for the Project and will allege (among other things) the County's and its Board of Supervisors' violation of the California Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code § 21000, et seq.), the State Guidelines for Implementing CEQA (Title 14, California Code of Regulations, § 15000, et seq.), the Planning and Zoning Law (Gov. Code § 65000, et seq.), as well as the County's General Plan and zoning ordinance. The grounds for these allegations were previously provided to the County's appointed and elected decision-making bodies by members of the SAVE THE CANYONS COALITION and others during the administrative processing and review of the Project.

This notice is provided to you pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.5.

Very truly yours,

LEIBOLD McCLENDON & MANN, P.C.

Re: Save the Canyons Coalition v. County of Orange, et al.
[Orange County Superior Court Case No. 30-2018-00992951-CU-WM-CXCI

Dear Mr. Becerra:

Enclosed please find a copy of the Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate in the above- referenced action. This copy is provided to you in compliance with Public Resources Code section 21167.7. The action challenges the County of Orange's approval of the so-called "Red Rock Gardens" project (the "Project") despite County staff cautioning County decision- makers that the Project was inconsistent with the County's General Plan, specific plan and zoning ordinance. It also challenges the mitigated negative declaration prepared for the Project in violation of CEQA (Pub. Resources Code § 21000, et seq.) and the State Guidelines for Implementing CEQA (Title 14, Cal. Code Regs., § 15000, et seq.).
Please acknowledge receipt of the enclosed Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate.
Unless you request otherwise, we will not serve on your office any documents other than this initial pleading and any amended or supplemental initial pleadings. Thank you for your attention to this matter, and please do not hesitate to call me if you would like to discuss this
matter further.

Very truly yours, LEIBOLD McCLENDON & MANN, P.C.
