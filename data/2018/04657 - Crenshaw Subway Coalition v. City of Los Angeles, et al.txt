PRINTED ON RECYCLED PAPER
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATOR Y RELIEF

INTRODUCTION

2 1. Petitioner and Plaintiff Crenshaw Subway Coalition (*Petitioner") brings this lawsuit to

3 challenge Respondents and Defendants City of Los Angeles' ("the City's") and Los Angeles City

4 Council's ("City Council's") (collectively, "Respondents") May 25, 2016 approval permitting Real

5 Parties in Interest Capri Urban Baldwin and Capri Urban Crenshaw or their successors in interest ("Real

6 Parties" or "RPIs") to construct the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza Master Plan Project ("the Project").
7 The approvals issued by Respondents include the certification of Environmental Impact Report ("EIR")

8 Number ENV-2012-1962-EIR; the adoption of Ordinance No. 185631; the approval of a Special

9 Permission for the Reduction of Off-Street Parking, and a Zoning Administrator's Determination to

10 allow shared parking for commercial uses; the adoption of a Development Agreement; and conditions of

11 approval for the Project.

12 2. The Project consists of over 3,000,000 square feet of floor area, and includes 961 housing
13 units including both condominiums (551 units) and rental apartments (410 units). The Project also

14 contains a 400-room hotel, and significant new retail and office space in an existing shopping mall. The

15 vast majority of the residential units are market rate units. Under the terms of the Development

16 Agreement, just 21 of the 410 rental apartments are set aside for tenants earning 80 percent of the area

17 median income, and 21 for tenants earning 60 percent of the median income. Of the 551 condominium

18 units, just 28 condominiums are set aside for "workforce" housing where purchasers earn 150 percent of

19 area median income and 28 for purchasers earning 50 percent of area median income. "Area median
20 income" is calculated by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and is based

21 upon the median income levels across the entire Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale metropolitan area.

22 For 2018, the area median income is $69,300. For a family of four, an income of $77,500 qualifies as
23 "low income" under the 80 percent area median income standard.

24 3. The Project is located near the Leimert Park neighborhood and in the Crenshaw Corridor.

25 Since the 1960's, Leimert Park and the Crenshaw Corridor have served as the political, cultural, and

26 commercial heart of Black Los Angeles. This area is home to among the last majority Black

27 communities in the City of Los Angeles, as well as many Latinx and Asian American residents. The

28 Crenshaw light rail line is presently under construction in the area. Studies have shown that low income

2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

-

2 residents within a half-mile of new rail transit are at the greatest risk of becoming displaced as a result a
of gentrification.

3 4.

4 The City's approval of the Project turns a blind eye to the imminently foreseeable effects

5 of constructing a large number of new, market rate housing in this community. The influx of new, more

6 affluent residents will have a ripple effect of displacement on the existing residents, who will see

7 increased rents and increased property values that put pressure on existing, lower income residents who

8 are already struggling to make ends meet. This influx of wealthier residents into what have been

9 historically low-income neighborhoods, and the demographic, cultural, and economic changes in those

10 neighborhoods is known as gentrification. Frequently, those who are pushed from their neighborhoods
are people of color.

11 5.

12 The poverty rate in the Crenshaw Corridor is 23 percent, higher than the County average

13 of 18 percent. The median household income in that area is $39,230, far lower than the median income

14 for the County of $57,952. Most renter households in the Crenshaw Corridor are severely rent-

15 burdened, spending over 50 percent of their household income on rent.

6.

16 This neighborhood is one of the most severely rent-burdened in Los Angeles County.

17 Even the paltry "affordable" units the developer has promised to provide will not actually be affordable

18 to the majority of nearby residents. According to U.S. Census data, the median household income for a

19 family of four in the census tract in which the Project is located is $21,899. A family of four earning as

20 much as $77,500 would qualify for the five percent of units set aside for low income renters. And the

21 vast majority of units would rent at higher prices than the specifically set-aside units.

7.

22 This economic reality is no secret to Respondents.

8.

23 In approving the Project and certifying the project's EIR, the City failed to comply with

24 the information and disclosure requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), by

25 inadequately analyzing the Project's impacts to the environment, insufficiently disclosing those impacts
to the public, and adequately mitigating the impacts.

26 9.

27 Petitioner seeks a determination from this Court that Respondents have not met their

28 obligations under CEQA to properly review and disclose the environmental impacts of, and feasible
alternatives to, the Project. Petitioner seeks a ruling that all of Respondents' actions approving the

3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1

Project and certifying the Project's EIR are void and contrary to law. Petitioner asks this Court to issue

2 peremptory and alternative writs of mandate to prevent Respondents or Real Parties in Interest from

3 taking actions based on the faulty approvals.

4 10. a Petitioner also seeks a preliminary injunction and/or an administrative stay if necessary

5 to prevent Real Parties from commencing construction activities on the parcels in question, including

6 demolition of existing structures and other site preparation activities, while this litigation is pending.

7 PARTIES

8 11. Petitioner and Plaintiff CRENSHAW SUBWAY COALITION ("CSC*) is a California
nonprofit organization of residents, property owners and merchants in the South Los Angeles
10 community, which seeks to empower stakeholder groups in the area of Baldwin Hills-Crenshaw-Leimert

11 Park-View Park-Park Mesa Heights. CSC works to highlight the issues of equitable and community-

12 centered transportation planning and responsible community development in the pursuit of racial and
13 economic justice. CSC is firmly opposed to new development around transit lines in South Los Angeles

14 that is out-of-scale, advances gentrification, promotes direct or indirect displacement, or fails to serve
15 the needs of existing residents for affordable housing.

16 12. Respondent and Defendant CITY OF LOS ANGELES is a charter city and the

17 governmental entity serving the people of the City of Los Angeles, in which the Project is proposed to
18 be located.

19 13. Respondent and Defendant LOS ANGELES CITY COUNCIL is the 15-member elected
20 body that represents the citizens of Los Angeles. The Council was the final decisionmaking body for the
21 Project under CEQA, and was the body that approved the Development Agreement, the zone change

22 ordinance, and certified the EIR.

23 14. Respondents and Defendants Does 1 through 100 are or were the agents, employees,
24 contractors, and/or entities acting under the authority of each other respondent or real party in interest,
25 and each performed acts on which this action is based within the cause and scope of such agency and/or
26 employment. Petitioners do not know the true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, or

27 otherwise, of Does 1 through 100, inclusive, and therefore sue said respondents and defendants under

28

-

2 fictitious names. Petitioner will amend its Petition and Complaint to show their true names and
capacities when they have been ascertained.

3 15.

4 Real Party in Interest CAPRI URBAN BALDWIN, LLC is a Delaware corporation, was

5 an applicant for the entitlements to construct the Project, and is a party to the Development Agreement

6 with Respondent City of Los Angeles. The California Secretary of State presently lists the status of this

7 entity as "forfeited" for failure to file a complete Statement of Information. The mailing address for this

8 entity listed with the California Secretary of State is 875 North Michigan Avenue, Suite 3430, Chicago,
IL.

9 16.

10 Real Party in Interest CAPRI URBAN CRENSHAW, LLC is a Delaware corporation,

11 was an applicant for the entitlements to construct the Project, and is a party to the Development

12 Agreement with Respondent City of Los Angeles. The California Secretary of State presently lists the

13 status of this entity as "forfeited" for failure to file a complete Statement of Information. The mailing

14 address for this entity listed with the California Secretary of State is 875 North Michigan Avenue, Suite
3430, Chicago, IL.

15 17.

16 Real Party in Interest CAPRI URBAN SANTA ROSALIA, LLC is a Delaware

17 corporation. This entity was not listed as an applicant for the project and was first registered with the

18 Secretary of State in April 2018. The mailing address for this entity listed with the California Secretary

19 of State is 875 North Michigan Avenue, Suite 3430, Chicago, IL. Petitioner names this entity in an

20 abundance of caution due to the forfeited status of the two applicant entities, the shared mailing address

21 of all three entities, and the recent creation date of this corporate entity.

18.

22 Real Parties in Interest Roes 1 through 100 are or were the agents, employees,

23 contractors, and/or entities acting under the authority of each other respondent or real party in interest,
and each performed acts on which this action is based within the cause and scope of such agency and/or
24 employment. Petitioners do not know the true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, or

25

26 otherwise, of real parties in interest Roes through 100, inclusive, and therefore sue said real parties in

27 interest under fictitious names. Petitioner will amend its Petition and Complaint to show their true
names and capacities when they have been ascertained.

10 As set forth in paragraph 11 above, Petitioner Crenshaw Subway Coalition participated

11 during the approval process for the Project. Petitioner provided both oral and written comments

12 sufficient to apprise the City and Council of their concerns regarding the Project. Petitioner further

13 incorporates the comments, both oral and written, made during the Project approval process by other

14 members of the public, including written comments to the Draft EIR and statements made at City

15 Council, City Council Planning and Land Use Management Committee, and City Planning Commission
meetings, raising concerns about the Project.

16 22.

17 On July 27, 2018, as required by Public Resources Code section 21167.5, Petitioner

18 notified Respondents that it intended to file suit to enforce the requirements of CEQA. Proof of service
of that notification by US Mail is attached as Exhibit 1.

19 23. On July 30, 2018, as required by Public Resources Code section 21167.7, Petitioner
20 informed the Attorney General that it intended to file this action. Proof of service of this letter is

26 The Project is proposed to be constructed on a roughly 43 acre site in the Crenshaw
neighborhood of Los Angeles. The site is bounded by

27 39th Street on the north, Crenshaw Boulevard on

28 the east, Stocker Street on the south, and Santa Rosalia Drive and Marlton Avenue on the west. The site

2 is bisected by Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard on an east-west axis to create a "north area" and south
area" of the Project.

3 26.

4 At the present time the site houses an 833,077 square foot enclosed retail shopping mall,

5 a 75,000 square foot multiplex theatre, 104,041 square feet of retail/restaurant use, and 4,623 square feet

6 of office use. The Project proposes to retain the existing mall building and two of the outbuildings,

7 while adding significant new residential, hotel, office, and commercial square footage, as described in
more detail below.

8 27.

9 On October 2, 2008, the Community Redevelopment Agency of the City of Los Angeles

10 issued a Notice of Preparation ("NOP"), stating that it would serve as the lead agency in preparing an

11 EIR for the project titled "Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza Redevelopment Project." The NOP stated that

12 the Project would redevelop an existing 1,000,0000 square foot retail mall to create a 3,501,0000 square

13 foot project that would include 1,770,000 square feet of retail, restaurant, and entertainment space,

14 approximately 150,000 square feet of office space, a 400 room hotel, and approximately 1,000 dwelling

15 units (including both condominiums and apartment units). The NOP also stated that 257,000 square feet

16 of the existing mall structures would be demolished while other portions of the mall would remain. The

17 Project was proposed to be constructed in phrases. The NOP identified possible impacts to the

18 environment in the areas of aesthetics, air quality, cultural/historic resources, geology/soils,

19 hydrology/water quality, land use and planning, noise, population and housing, public services,
transportation and circulation, parking, and public utilities.

20 28.

21 The City held a Public Scoping Meeting for the project on October 15, 2008. The City

22 received e written comments in response the NOP. At the Scoping Meeting, members of the public

23 expressed concerns about the impact of the project on traffic, views, noise, and on the quality of life in
the community.

24 29.

25 The City released the Draft Environmental Impact Report ("DEIR") for the Baldwin

26 Hills Crenshaw Plaza Master Plan Project on December 18, 2014, more than six years after the NOP and

27 Scoping Meeting. The DEIR was released for a 62-day public comment period that expired on February

28 17, 2015. The project analyzed in the DEIR had changed somewhat from the project described in the
NOP. The project would demolish only 90,899 feet of the existing mall, and would increase the net

7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATOR Y RELIEF

1 square footage to 2,056,215 square feet for a total of 3,072,956 square feet of construction on the project

2 site. The project analyzed in the DEIR would increase retail/restaurant use by 331,838 square feet, add

3 143,377 square feet of office use, 346,500 square feet of hotel use with up to 400 hotel rooms, and

4 1,234,500 square feet of residential uses in 961 residential units consisting of 551 condominiums and

5 410 apartments. At the time the DEIR was circulated, the project required a General Plan amendment; a

6 zone change; conditional use permits for hotel use within 500 feet of a residential zone, floor area
7 averaging, and alcoholic beverage service; approval for shared parking and parking reductions; a
8 Development Agreement; approval of Site Plan review; and haul route approval. The DEIR identified

9 significant impacts from the project with respect to air quality during construction and operation; noise
10 during construction; and transportation and circulations, including impacts at 10 intersections, three

11 access locations to the project site, and in the form of neighborhood traffic intrusion.

12 30. On January 28, 2016, the City released a Recirculated Draft Environmental Impact

13 Report (RDEIR) due to changes in the project as it was originally proposed in the DEIR. The RDEIR

14 proposed to retain an additional structure from the existing mall - Outbuilding B - that had been
15 proposed for demolition in the DEIR. The total development of 3,072,956 square feet remained the

16 same. The RDEIR made minor revisions to the analysis of the DEIR to account for the changes in the

17 proposed project, including the provision of fewer parking spaces. The impacts of the project described

18 in the RDEIR were the same as the impacts identified in the DEIR.

19 31. The City received 57 comment letters on the DEIR and RDEIR from government
20 agencies and members of the public. Comments raised concerns regarding the aesthetic impacts of the
21 project, including light and glare; the noise impacts; land use impacts; transportation and circulation

22 impacts; recreation and parks; and the range of alternatives.

23 32. The Final Environmental Impact Report ("FEIR") was released in November 2016. The

24 FEIR detailed some additional changes to the proposed project, including a reduction in height for the

25 office building and hotel. The FEIR contained modest changes to conform to these reduced heights and
26 clarified requirements of certain mitigation measures. The FEIR also responded to comments received,

27 including topical responses on two aesthetic issues.

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 33. In January 2017, an Errata to FEIR was released. The Errata made a number of technical

2 corrections to the FEIR.

3 34. On December 21, 2016, a public hearing on the Project was held by the Deputy Advisory

4 Agency of the City of Los Angeles. The Deputy Advisory Agency considered the request for a Vesting

5 Tentative Tract Map to permit the merger and resubdivision of the project site to create 17 ground lots

6 and 13 airspace lots, and took testimony on the EIR, the request for a General Plan Amendment, zone
7 change, and conditional use permits and other entitlements. The Deputy Advisory Agency also took

8 testimony regarding a proposed Development Agreement. The notice to the public regarding the

9 hearing explained that "[t]he EIR will be submitted to the City Planning Commission and City Council

10 for requested certification and action on the project."

11 35. On January 18, 2017, the Deputy Advisory Agency issued its decision on the Vesting

12 Tentative Tract Map. The final recordation of the tentative tract map requires approval of the
13 companion entitlements outside the Deputy Advisory Agency's jurisdiction. If those entitlements are

14 not approved, the applicant must submit a modification to the tract map.

15 36. On July 13, 2017, the City Planning Commission held a hearing to make

16 recommendations to the City Council on the adoption of the Development Agreement and the Zone
17 Change Ordinance, and to consider the applicant's requests for reduced parking, along with conditions

18 of approval for the Project. On August 3, 2017, the City Planning Commission issued its decisions,
19 recommending that the City Council approve the Development Agreement and the Zone Change
20| Ordinance, and granting the requests for reduced parking. On August 18, 2017, seven appeals were
21 filed of the City Planning Commission's determination, including by Petitioner.

22 37. On June 5, 2018, the City Council's Planning and Land Use Management ("PLUM")

23 Committee held a meeting to consider the appeals of the City Planning Commission determinations and

24 to make recommendations to the full City Council on the legislative entitlements required for the

25 Project, including the Zone Change Ordinance and the Development Agreement. The PLUM

26 Committee voted to recommend that the full City Council certify the EIR, approve the Development
27 Agreement and the Zone Change Ordinance, deny the appeals, and adopt the findings of the City
28 Planning Commission.

1 38. The City Council met on June 27, 2018, and voted unanimously to adopt the PLUM

2 Committee's report on the Project. The City Council denied the appeals, approved the Zone Change

3 Ordinance and Development Agreement, and certified the EIR.

4 39. The City's Notice of Determination for the approval of the Project and the Development
5 Agreement was posted on June 29, 2018.

6 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

7 Violation of California Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code § 21168, Code of Civ. Proc., § 1094.5)
8 40. Petitioner incorporates by reference all the allegations contained in the previous
9 paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.
10 41. CEQA requires environmental review and analysis prior to the approval of discretionary
11 projects by local governments. The Legislature has declared that CEQA supports numerous state
12 policies for "the maintenance of a quality environment for the people of this state now and in the future.
13 (Pub. Resources Code, § 21000, subd. (a).) Moreover, the Legislature has declared that "the
14 interrelationship of policies and practices in the management of natural resources and waste disposal
15 requires systematic and concerted efforts by public and private interests to enhance environmental
16 quality and control environmental pollution." (Id., subd. (f).) Finally, "[i]t is the intent of the
17 Legislature that all agencies of the state government which regulate activities of private individuals,
18 corporations, and public agencies which are found to affect the quality of the environment, shall regulate
19 such activities so that major consideration is given to preventing environmental damage, while
20 providing a decent home and satisfying living environment for every Californian." (Id., subd. (g).)
21 Long-term protection of the environment is a fundamental criterion of CEQA. (Pub. Resources Code,
22 § 21001, subd. (g).)
23 42. The basic purposes of CEQA are to inform governmental decision makers and the public
24 about the potential, significant environmental effects of proposed activities, identify ways that
25 environmental damage can be avoided or significantly reduced, prevent such damage by the imposition
26 of mitigation measures or the adoption of alternative activities that avoid such damage, and disclosure to
27 the public of the reasons for approving an activity with significant, unmitigable environmental effect.
28 (CEQA Guidelines, Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15002(a).)

10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 43. CEQA requires the assessment and public disclosure of potentially adverse impacts that a

2 discretionary project, requiring public agency approval, might have on the environment. (Pub.

3 Resources Code, §§ 21002, 21002.1.) CEQA states that public agencies may not approve projects "if

4 there are feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures available which would substantially lessen

5 the significant environmental effects of such projects." (Id., § 21002.) The Legislature has established

6 a variety of methods to accomplish its goals concerning California's environment. The principal

7 method is the drafting and completion of an EIR.

8 44. An EIR is a descriptive statement that provides governmental agencies and the public

9 with detailed information about the harm that a proposed project may have on the environment, lists

10 ways in which those significant impacts may be minimized, and indicates alternatives to the proposed
11 project. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21061.)

12 45. In addition to those provisions found in the Public Resources Code, the Legislature has
13 authorized and directed the Office of Planning and Research to adopt guidelines for the implementation
14 of CEQA (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15000 et seq.; hereinafter referred to and cited as "Guidelines").
15 (See Pub. Resources Code, § 21083.) The Guidelines are binding on all state and local agencies,
16 including Respondents. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, §§ 15000, 15020.)

17 46. According to the Guidelines, an EIR must be adequate, complete, and exhibit a good-
18 faith effort at full disclosure. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15151.) The EIR must identify the significant
19 environmental impacts of the project, including those impacts that cannot be avoided if the project is
20 implemented, as well as significant irreversible environmental changes related to implementation of the
21 project, alternatives to the project, and measures to mitigate the impacts of the project. (Id., § 15126;
22 see also id., §§ 15126.4, 15126.6.)

23 47. "An EIR shall describe a range of reasonable alternatives to the project which would

24 feasibly attain most of the basic objectives of the project but would avoid or substantially lessen any of
25 the significant effects of the project, and evaluate the comparative merits of the alternatives." (Cal.

26 Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15126.6, subd. (a).) The EIR's "discussion of the alternatives shall focus on
27 alternatives to the project or its location which are capable of avoiding or substantially lessening any
28 significant effects of the project, even if these alternatives would impede to some degree the attainment

11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

of the project objectives, or would be more costly" (id., § 15126.6, subd. (b)), and the "EIR shall include

2 sufficient information about each alternative to allow meaningful evaluation, analysis, and comparison
with the proposed project" (id., § 15126.6, subd. (d)).

4 48. "Public participation is an essential part of the CEQA process." (Cal. Code Regs., tit.
§ 14, § 15201.) The public is entitled to file written comments regarding the environmental review of the

6 project (see id., §§ 15087, 15202, 15203) and to testify at any public hearing concerning the EIR (see

7 id., § 15202, subd. (d) [the "draft EIR should be used as a basis for discussion at a public hearing"]; see

8 also id., § 15202, subd. (b) ["If an agency provides a public hearing on its decision to carry out or

9 approve a project, the agency should include environmental review as one of the subjects for the
10 hearing.")).

11 49. An agency's written responses to comments must provide a description of the significant

12 issues raised by the comments and, particularly when the opinion in the comments varies from that of

13 the agency, the agency must address the comments in detail and provide a good-faith reason why
14 specific comments and suggestions were not accepted. (Cal. Code Regs., tit 14, § 15088; see id.,
15 15202.)

16 50. Agencies may not undertake actions that could have a significant adverse effect on the

17 environment, or limit the choice of alternatives or mitigation measures, before complying with CEQA.
18 (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15004 subd. (b)(2).) CEQA also requires that an agency consider the
19 cumulative effects of its actions. Where "individual projects are, or a phased project is, to be undertaken

20 and where the total undertaking comprises a project with significant environmental effect," the agency
21 must prepare an EIR addressing the scope of the entire project, including "comment upon the
22 cumulative effect." (Id., § 15165.)

23 51. The EIR does not comply with CEQA's mandates and requirements in several critical

24 respects.

25 52. The EIR does not analyze the foreseeable environmental consequences of the

26 displacement of low income area residents. The project introduces a highly significant quantity of

27 market rate housing into an area in which the vast majority of residents are low income, in which

28 residents already struggle to pay rent. Studies have demonstrated that such projects have a foreseeable

12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

ripple effect causing rents and property values nearby to increase. Because many households in the

2 neighborhoods nearest the Project are already rent-burdened, additional increases to rent are likely to

3 displace some of these residents. There are an estimated 69,617 individuals in rent-burdened

4 households at moderate risk of displacement. Of these, 65,447 individuals are renters from lower

5 income households who are at higher risk of displacement. There are 40,279 individuals who are highly

6 at-risk of displacement because they are rent burdened low income individuals who live within 0.5 miles

7 of a rail station, the radius in which the price effects of transit development are most pronounced.

8 53. Petitioner provided evidence to Respondents that this significant human displacement is

9 not only foreseeable, but that it is linked to environmental effects that should have been analyzed in the
10 EIR for the Project. The CEQA Guidelines require an analysis whether a proposed project will displace
11 substantial numbers of people. This inquiry is distinct and separate from the question whether a

12 proposed project will displace housing, SO the inquiry does not end with the fact that no housing is being

13 displaced.

14 54. The EIR failed to address the displacement of people. Instead, the EIR determined
15 whether "jobs," would be displaced, and because there would not be significant "job" displacement,
16 improperly concluded that the Project would not result in displacement. The EIR ignored the reality that
17 large influxes of affluent residents in low income communities greatly increases the risk of displacement
18 of nearby existing residents when rents and property values rise as result of investment in luxury or a

19 high-end housing and retail amenities. Rather than benefitting from the new amenities, these long-time
20 residents wind up being forced out of their existing community and into other communities that have not
21 experienced gentrification. This displacement is directly traceable to environmental effects, including

22 increased vehicle miles traveled, increased demand for housing in outer-lying areas of the City or in
23 other jurisdictions, and increased air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from greater travel and
24 construction of housing elsewhere. These impacts are foreseeable and of the type that can and should be
25 examined in an EIR for a project of this scale and in a location like the Crenshaw Corridor where

26 gentrification is a reality.

27 55. The traffic impacts of the Project are inadequately analyzed and insufficiently mitigated.
28 While the EIR discloses that there will be an impact on residential streets through cut-through traffic,

13
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

F the EIR fails to identify which streets are likely to be impacted, instead identifying a handful of areas in

2 which an impact might occur. The EIR makes no effort to analyze the potential impact.

3 56. Nor does the EIR or the Mitigation and Monitoring Program impose any mitigation

4 measures for the admitted significant impact from cut through traffic. Instead, the Mitigation and

5 Monitoring Program specifies a sum of money to spend on future studies and mitigation design, without

6 setting forth any standards to determine whether and when a street is impacted. This procedure is

7 improper deferral of mitigation under CEQA.

8 57. The EIR fails to analyze the greenhouse gas impacts of the Project, failing to

9 acknowledge that any "reductions" in greenhouse gas emissions from the operation of the Project are

10 due to actions that are already legally required. The EIR then improperly concludes that the Project will
11 not have an impact on greenhouse gases because of these reductions, but none of these reductions is a

12 genuine reduction from what would already be legally required actions, and there is no analysis whether

13 compliance with these existing standards will interfere with the state's ambitious climate change

14 objectives, which is the EIR's threshold for a significant impact. a

15 58. The project analyzed in the EIR is inadequately described, in a manner that prejudiced

16 the EIR's analysis of the project's impacts and the alternatives to the project. The Project's

17 development will take place in phases. The Project's Conditions of Approval stipulate that the applicant

18 must apply for Site Plan Review for each phrase of the project. However, the Statement of Overriding

19 consideration is premised upon the complete construction of the Project. There is no guarantee that all
20 phases of the Project will actually be constructed as set forth in the EIR. However, once earlier phases

21 have been completed, changes in future phases may alter or even eliminate aspects of the Project that

22 Respondents relied upon in determining that the benefits of the Project outweigh its environmental

23 impacts. The community may be left with the burdens imposed by the earlier phases without the

24 benefits expected to be achieved in later phases. The project description in the EIR does not adequately

25 address the open-ended nature of the Project approvals.

26 59. The baseline for the environmental analysis should have been updated.

27 60. Petitioner is not in possession of the full administrative record. Upon completion of their
28 review, Petitioner may identify additional violations of CEQA.

14
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 61. The purpose of CEQA is to provide full information to the decisionmaking body about

2 the environmental impacts of a proposed project, as well as alternatives to the proposed project that

3 might reduce those impacts. That purpose was defeated here where a true reduced alternative was not

4 included in the EIR's range of alternative proposals. Instead, the EIR provided more information on the

5 environmental consequences of approving a larger project in order to create a favorable comparison with

6 the proposed project.

7 62. A public agency's failure to comply with either the substantive requirements of CEQA or

8 its procedures, SO that complete information as to the Project's impacts is neither developed nor publicly

9 disclosed, is a prejudicial abuse of the agency's discretion requiring invalidation of the agency's action

10 regardless of whether full compliance would have produced a different result. (Id., § 21005, subd. (a).)

11 63. The City abused its discretion by certifying the EIR, because the EIR does not conform
12 to CEQA's requirements, and is not based on substantial evidence. A writ of mandate may issue to

13 correct this abuse of discretion and equire the City Council to rescind its certification of the EIR and

14 the associated Statement of Overriding Considerations and Mitigation and Monitoring Plan.
15 64. Under Public Resources Code section 21167, subdivision (c), an action alleging that an

16 EIR does not comply with CEQA must be filed within 30 days of the posting of the Notice of

17 Determination. This action is timely filed within 30 days of June 29, 2018, the date the Notice of

18 Determination was posted.

19 65. Petitioner has a direct and beneficial interest in the action herein and has exhausted all

20 other available remedies.

21 66. Petitioner has a beneficial right to Respondents' performance of their respective duties

22 based on Petitioner's interest in maintaining and improving the quality of the urban infrastructure in the

23 City, as well as the interest of Petitioner's members in improving quality of life in their own city.
24 67. Respondents' actions in approving the Project and certifying its EIR have caused and

25 threaten to cause Petitioner irreparable and substantial harm.

26 68. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy at law, in that unless this Court

27 enjoins the Real Parties, they will develop the Project consistent with the invalid and void Development
28 Agreement and the improperly certified EIR. No amount of monetary damages or other legal remedy

15
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 can adequately compensate Petitioner for the irreparable harm that Petitioner, its members, and the

2 residents of the City of Los Angeles will suffer from the violations of law described herein.

3 69. A dispute has arisen between Petitioner and Respondents, in that Petitioner believes and

4 contends, for the reasons set forth above, that Respondents' actions as set forth above were unlawful and

5 invalid. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis contends, that Respondents contend in all

6 respects to the contrary.

7 70. Petitioner contends that the EIR does not comply with the requirements of CEQA, for the

8 reasons set forth above. Petitioner is informed and believes that in response to Petitioner having

9 identified these issues for Respondents, Respondents have disagreed with Petitioner's contentions.

10 71. A judicial declaration as to the legality of Respondents' actions, as set forth above, is
11 therefore necessary and appropriate to determine the respective rights and duties of the parties.

12 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

13 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for relief as follows:

14 1. That this Court issue a peremptory writ of mandate commanding Respondents: to rescind
15 all approvals issued in support of the Project, including, but not limited to the Ordinance approving the

16 Zone Change, the Development Agreement, the certification of the EIR, the adoption of the Statement

17 of Overriding Considerations, the adoption of the Mitigation and Monitoring Program, the approval of

18 reduced parking requirements, and the adoption of Findings in support of all of the above approvals;

19 2. That this Court issue a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction,
20 administrative stay, and permanent injunction enjoining Respondents and Real Parties from taking any
21 action to implement the Project, and to further enjoin Respondents and Real Parties from taking any

22 action to construct the Project, including but not limited to demolition, grading, and construction

23 activities, until such time as the City Council has certified an EIR that conforms to the requirements of
24 CEQA;

25 3. That this Court issue declaratory relief that Respondents' have not complied with CEQA

26 in their approvals for the Project;

27 4. That this Court award Petitioner costs and attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil

28 Procedure section 1021.5 or other applicable law; and

16
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 5. That this Court grant Petitioner such other, different, or further relief as the Court may
2 deem just and proper.
