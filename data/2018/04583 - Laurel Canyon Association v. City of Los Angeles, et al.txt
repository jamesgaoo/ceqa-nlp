VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Petitioner, LAUREL CANYON ASSOCIATION ("Petitioner"), alleges:
2 1. The project is a proposed single family dwelling on an undeveloped property
3 located at 2239 Laurel Canyon Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA (*Project"). Among other things,
4 the Project requires the removal of protected trees and the issuance of a Tree Removal Permit
5 from the City of Los Angeles.

6 2. Petitioner, Laurel Canyon Association ("Petitioner"), is a California non-profit
corporation whose purpose is to promote the social welfare and environment in the City of Los
8 Angeles and Laurel Canyon in particualr. Petitioner and its respective members have a direct and
9 substantial beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondent complies with laws relating to
10 environmental protection. Petitioner and its respective members are adversely affected by

§ 11 Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA in approving the Project. Petitioner has standing to Channel Law Group, d77 L1Z06 12 ouns "pAla eJjysiIm ooZg assert the claims raised in this Petition because Petitioner and its members' aesthetic and

8 13 environmental interests are directly and adversely affected by Respondent's' approval of the
'SI!H Beverly 14 Project.
15 3. Respondent, City of Los Angeles ("Respondent"), is a charter city incorporated
16 under the laws of the State of California. The City is the lead agency under the California
17 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA").

18 4. Real Party in Interest, Atamanid Investments LLC is a limited liability company
19 that is developing the Project. Real Party in Interest, Tigran Sargsyan has represented himself to
the City as the "Owner" of the property in question and is listed as the agent for service of 20

21 process for Atamanid Investments LLC. Both Atamanid Investments LLC and Tigran Sargsyan
22 are hereinafter referred to collectively as "Real Party in Interest" or "Developer."
23 5. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Real Parties sued herein
24 as ROES 1-25, inclusive, and therefore sues these Real Parties by such fictitious names.
25 Petitioner will amend this Petition to allege the true names and capacities of fictitiously named

On March 10, 2017, the City of Los Angeles Urban Forestry Division approved a alleged in this Petition.

Tree Removal Permit in order to facilitate the Project. The City erroneously determined that the 6.

Project was exempt from CEQA as a Class 3 project and issued a Notice of Exemption for the
5 Project. The permit authorized the removal of two Southern California Black Walnuts, which are

6 protected tree pursuant to Ordinance No. 177404 which cannot be removed without a

8. The developer filed a Notice of Exemption with the County Recorder on February
18 27, 2018 despite the fact that Petitioner had filed appeal of the environmental determination for 17

19| the Project. This action has been brought within 35 days of the filing of the aforementioned
20 Notice of Exemption with the County Recorder.
21 This action arises under CEQA and its implementing regulations, which are
22 prescribed by the Secretary of the California Resources Agency to be followed by all state and 9.

23 local agencies when undertaking projects subject to CEQA. (Pub. Resources Code§ 21000 et
24 seq.; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15000 et seq.) This Court has jurisdiction over the matters
25 alleged in this Petition pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, and Public Resources
26 Code section 21168.5. In the alternative, this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil
27 Procedure section 1094.5 and Public Resources Code section 21168.

comments on the Project and raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this petition.

CEQA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS

12. California Environmental Quality Act is California's broadest environmental
law. CEQA helps to guide public agencies such as the City during issuance of permits and

10 approval of projects. Courts have interpreted CEQA to afford the fullest protection of the
11 environment within the reasonable scope of the statutes. CEQA applies to all discretionary § d11 'dnoJo ME |euueuo -LZ06 12

or other entitlement for use by one or more public agencies.' [Citation.] The statutory definition environment, and

18

19 is augmented by the [CEQA] Guidelines [Cal.Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15000 et seq.], which define
20 a 'project' as the whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in either a direct
21 physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the
22 environment....' Tuolumne County Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. V. City of Sonora

24 phases of a project that are reasonably foreseeable, and all related projects that are directly linked
25 to the project. (CEQA Guidelines section 15378).
26 14. A strong presumption in favor of requiring preparation of an Environmental

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 The Class 3 exemption is reserved for new construction or conversion of small structures (which
2 include the construction of one single family dwelling). However, according to the State CEQA
3 Guidelines, the following exceptions are applicable to the use of this exemption:
(a) Location. Classes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 11 are qualified by consideration of where the
project is to be located -- project that is ordinarily insignificant in its impact on the
environment may in a particularly sensitive environment be significant. Therefore, these
classes are considered to apply all instances, except where the project may impact on an
environmental resource of hazardous or critical concern where designated, precisely
mapped, and officially adopted pursuant to law by federal, state, or local agencies.
10 (b) Cumulative Impact. All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the
11 cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is g Channel Law Group, d11 -LZ06 12 significant.

13 (c) Significant Effect. A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity 8 ouns "pAE eJUSUM 00Z8 'SIIH AueAg 14 where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity a will have a significant effect on
15 the environment due to unusual circumstances.

16 (d) Scenic Highways. A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project
17 which may result in damage to scenic resources, including but not limited to, trees,
18 historic buildings, rock outcroppings, or similar resources, within a highway officially
19 designated as a state scenic highway. This does not apply to improvements which are
20 required as mitigation by an adopted negative declaration or certified EIR.
21 (e) Hazardous Waste Sites. A categorical exemption shall not be used for project
22 located on a site which is included on any list compiled pursuant to Section 65962.5 of

23 Zone No. 53.
24 23. The property's value as habitat for flora and fauna cannot be disputed. The entire
25 area serves as a refuge for area wildlife. Refuges such as this are important elements of the urban
26 landscape and their value cannot be dismissed. Developments like the proposed Project displace
27 'urban wildlife' into residential backyards and city streets, and habitat disruption can result in an
28

7

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 imbalance on food chain populations and lead wildlife to seek both food and shelter in residential

2 areas and to stray into city streets and public areas.

24. The future viability of hundreds of California's wildlife species are dependent on
the maintenance of biologically functional and contiguous oak and walnut woodland ecosystems
5 al local and bioregional scales. The untouched oak/walnut woodland is incredibly important to
6 the local wildlife, as the development is located within an established Habitat Linkage Zone
7 comprised of over ten acres. The bottom line is that the Project may impact on an environmental
8 resource of critical concern.

25. The SMMC's Habitat Linkage Zone Planning Map builds on the Santa Monica
10| Mountains Comprehensive Plan which was adopted in 1979. The property is subject to the Plan
11 because it is located within the Santa Monica Mountains Zone. The Zone was established by the § Channel Law Group, d77 LIZ06 suns "pAg eJJYSIIM O0Z8 12 Legislature via the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy Act, which is codified at Section
8 13 33001 of the Public Resources Code. The Act states as follows:
'SI!H Kueseg 14

15 "The Legislature hereby finds and declares that the Santa Monica Mountains Zone, as
defined in Section 33105, is a unique and
16 valuable economic, environmental, agricultural, scientific, educational, and recreational resource that should be held in trust for present and future generations; that, 17 as the last large undeveloped arca contiguous to the shoreline within the greater Los
18 Angeles metropolitan region, comprised of Los Angeles and Ventura Counties, it provides essential relief from the urban environment; that it exists it as single
19 ecosystem in which changes that affect one part may also affect all other parts; and that the preservation and protection of this resource is in the public interest."
20

21 26. So, the Legislature itself declared that the Santa Monica Mountains Zone is

22 unique and valuable environmental resource that provided essential relief from the urban
23 environment. Notwithstanding the habitat maps, all of the Santa Monica Mountains comprise an
24 environmental resource of critical concern. The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy Act goes

25 on to say the following:

26
"in the absence of a governmental mechanism to perform such evaluations, piecemeal 27 development projects were occurring within the zone which resulted in
28 the irreplaceable loss of open space and recreational resources, in the physical and

8

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

NH biological deterioration of air, land, and water systems within the zone, and adversely affected regional life-support systems, including fish and wildlife, therefore being harmful to the needs of the present and future population of the region."

27. The Legislature further declared at PRC Section 33008 that:

"there are existing problems of substandard lots, incompatible land uses, conflicts with recreational use, and inadequate resource protection which, in some cases, cannot be addressed in a feasible manner by local government exercise of the police power or
federal land acquisition as part of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area,
and that it is necessary to enact the provisions of this division as a complement to the full
8 exercise of the police power by local governments . .

10 28. The Legislature also stated that "the people of the State of California have an

11 interest in the protection of resources and the use of lands acquired or managed by the
§ Channel Law sdnom9 d77 LLZ06
8 GUnS "PNE BJJUSIM 0OZ8 12 conservancy pursuant to this division, and that the conservancy in carrying out its duties pursuant

13 to this division acts on behalf of the State of California."

29. SILH AUeAa 14 The City of Los Angeles adopted a formal resolution in 1979 undertaking its
15 intent to implement the Plan as the local agency with planning and land use jurisdiction. The
16 Plan was mandated by the Legislature and is a planning tool designed to help conserve and

17 preserve the Santa Monica Mountains. Policy No. 21 specifically deals with Wildlife Protection.

18 30. In sum, the use of the Class 3 single-family home exemption cannot be used for

19 this project both because it is located within the Santa Monica Mountains Zone and within
20 Habitat Linkage Zone Number 53. Environmental review pursuant to CEQA is required because

21 the mountains are an environmental resource of critical concern that have been designed and
22 precisely mapped pursuant to state law.

23 31. Laurel Canyon Boulevard is a Designated Scenic Highway. The City also cannot
24 deem this project exempt from CEQA because Laurel Canyon Boulevard is a designated scenic
25 highway. The City has designated 69 scenic highways in the City. The City's designated scenic
26  highways are listed in Appendix B of the City of Los Angeles Mobility Plan. Laurel Canyon
27 Boulevard is listed on the City's inventory. Laurel Canyon Boulevard's "scenic feature or
28  resource" is described as follows: "winding cross mountain road through [a] rustic area." The

9

City correctly determined that Laurel Canyon Boulevard was a scenic highway. The street
traverses are area of 'natural scenic quality in an undeveloped and/or sparsely developed area of
3 the City.'
"Scenic resources" are considered environmental resources under CEQA. For
example, the CEQA Guidelines contains an Environmental Checklist Form (Appendix G) that 32.

6 lists impacts to scenic resources under the "aesthetic" environmental factor.1 Again, CEQA
7 Guidelines Section 15300.2(a) prevents the use of a CEQA exemption where the project may
8 impact on an environmental resource of critical concern that has been designated and precisely
mapped. Because the City has officially designated Laurel Canyon Boulevard as a scenic
10 highway and the Project is located right next to the Boulevard, the City erred when it deemed the
11 Project exempt from CEQA. 8 d11 'dnoJ5 MET lauueyS -LZ06 eyns "pAlE eUJysiM 0OZ8 12 Finally, it should be noted that the City interim design guidelines for scenic highways such as

10 34. None of the design guidelines in the Mobility Element have been applied to the
11 Project. & Channel Law Group, d77 LIZ06 12 35. The Project is Located within a Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone. As noted Byns "pALa eJJusIM ooZ8 14 single-family home exemption "where the project may impact on an environmental resource of 8 13 above, CEQA Guidelines Section 15300.2(a) specifically excepts a project such as this from the
*SIlH ALeAeg 15 hazardous or critical concern" where officially designated. Here, the property has been officially
16 mapped in a "Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone" due to its location in a fire-prone hillside
17 area of the City.
18 36. The City has defined the "Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone" as follows:
19 "Any area within the City of Los Angeles that poses a significant threat of fire from adjoining
20 | natural brush hillside areas and which is determined by the following factors: topography,
21| infrastructure, fire protection, population density, types of construction, weather, existing fire
22 codes and ordinances, and fire history."
23 37. LAMC Section 57.202. The City's Zone Information and Map Access System
24 ("ZIMAS") describes the Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone as follows:
25 "Lands designated by the City of Los Angeles Fire Department pursuant to Government
26 Code 51178 that were identified and recommended to local agencies by the Director of
27 Forestry and Fire Protection based on criteria that includes fuel loading, slope, fire

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

NH weather, and other relevant factors. These areas must comply with the Brush Clearance
Requirements of the Fire Code. The Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone (VHFHSZ)
was first established in the City of Los Angeles in 1999 and replaced the older 'Mountain

Fire District' and *Buffer Zone."

38. There should be no question that this officially designated zone represents a

6 "hazardous" concern. Further, the property has been officially mapped in a fault zone and
7 liquefaction zone as evidence by the City's own mapping system, ZIMAS.
8 39. It simply cannot be disputed that these zones have been officially designated
9 pursuant to law and that they represent an "environmental resource of hazardous concern."
10 Therefore, the Project cannot be exempted from CEQA.
11 40. The Project is Not Exempt from CEQA Because the City Has Proposed Mitigation § Channel Law dnouo d71 +LZ06 euns "pAE HJJYSIIM 00Z8 12 Measures in the Form of Specialized Conditions of Approval for the Project. Significantly, in

8 13 evaluating whether categorical exemption may apply, the City may not rely on mitigation
'SILH Áueng 14 measures as a basis for concluding that a project is categorically exempt, or as a basis for
15 determining that one of the significant effects exceptions does not apply. Salmon Protection &
16 Watershed Network v. County of Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098.
17 41. The City has sought to deem this project "exempt" from City by way of an
18 environmental mitigation measure namely, the planting of replacement trees on the property.
19 However, the general requirement to plant replacement trees is not a regulatory compliance
20 measure at all. Rather, it is a discretionary environmental mitigation measure. The City's
21 Protected Tree Ordinance states as follows:

as a 22 "The Board of Public Works or its authorized officer or employee may [rJequire
23 condition of a grant of permit for the relocation or removal of a protected tree, that the
24 permittee replace the tree within the same property boundaries by at least two trees of a
25 protected variety included within the definition set forth in Section 46.01 of this Code, in
26 a manner acceptable to the Board."
27 LAMC Section 46.02(c).
28

12

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 42. The Ordinance uses the word "may" . not "shall." This is significant. The tree
2 replacements that are traditionally mandated by the Board of Public Works are discretionary
3 environmental mitigation measures. They are not mandatory "regulatory compliance measures."
The City cannot use a mitigation measure to reach a determination that a project is exempt from
CEQA. This is fundamental black letter CEQA law.

6 43. Further, the Grading Division has issued a Geology and Soils Report Approval
Letter for the Project. This letter contains numerous conditions of approval. Many of these

8 conditions are not simply applications of the California Building Code or existing City of Los
9 Angeles regulations. The fact that the Geology Report contains specialized mitigation measures
10 renders the application of : categorical exemption in appropriate and unlawful.
11 44. The Project is Also Not Exempt from CEQA Because the City Seeks to Defer § d77 'dnojg MET jeuueyo LLZ06 12| Application of Mitigation Measures to Another Date. Additionally, many of the conditions of

E 13 approval in the Geology and Soils Report Approval Letter simply "kick the can" down the road
‡ 14 and defer required environmental analysis to another date. This does not comply with CEQA.
Beverly 15 45. Conditioning a project on another agency's future review of environmental
16 impacts, without evidence of the likelihood of effective mitigation by the other agency, is
17 insufficient to support determination by the lead agency that potentially significant impacts will
18 be mitigated. Sundstrom v. Cnty. of Mendocino (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 296. Further, requiring
19 formulation of mitigation measures at a future time violates the rule that members of the public
20 and other agencies must be given an opportunity to review mitigation measures before a project
21 is approved. PRC § 21080, subd. (c)(2)). See League for Protection of Oakland Architectural &
22 Historic Resources v. City of Oakland (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 896; Gentry v. City of Murrieta

recommended in a future study may conflict the requirement that project plans incorporate
mitigation measures before a proposed negative declaration is released for public review. PRC §
21080, subd. (c)(2); 14 Cal Code Regs § 15070(b)(1). Studies conducted after a project's
approval do not guarantee an adequate inquiry into environmental effects. Such a mitigation

Re: Notice of Intent to Commence CEQA Action and Proceeding; Tree Removal Permit (SR Number 1-95600781) Issued for 2239 Laurel Canyon Boulevard; Council File # 17-0415): Log Reference 1-95600781

Dear City of Los Angeles:

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under California Public Resources Code section 21167.5, that
Petitioner, Laurel Canyon Association ("Petitioner"), intends to immediately a file a Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint ("Petition") under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") against the City of Los Angeles (City" or "Respondent"). The Petition will be filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court and will allege, inter alia, that the City incorrectly determined that the proposed single family dwelling and associated tree removal permit located at 2239 Laurel Canyon Blvd, ("Project") was exempt from CEQA. Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21151(c), the Laurel Canyon Association filed a timely appeal of this exemption determination to the City Council on or about April 12, 2017; however, to date the City has failed to conduct a hearing or
act on the appeal. The developer filed a Notice of Exemption with the County Recorder on or about February 27, 2018 despite the fact that an appeal was pending with the City. Among other things, the Petition will request that the court direct the City to vacate and rescind the project approvals, the determination that the project is exempt CEQA and to otherwise comply with CEQA. Also, the Petition will seek Petitioners' cost and attorneys' fees.
