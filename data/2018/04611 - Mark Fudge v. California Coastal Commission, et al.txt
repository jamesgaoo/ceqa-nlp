Petitioner and Plaintiff MARK FUDGE ("Petitioner") hereby complains of Respondents

2 and Defendants CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION and JOHN AINSWORTH in his

3 capacity as Executive Director of the California Coastal Commission (collectively
p "Commission") and alleges as follows:

INTRODUCTION

O 1. This case involves the same set of facts, and is therefore related to Mark Fudge v.
City of Laguna Beach, et al. (Orange County Superior Court), Case No. 30-2017-00930564-CU-

8 WM-CXC, assigned for all purposes to the Honorable Glenda Sanders ("City Case"). The City
9 Case is presently on appeal. Petitioner files this related case ("Commission Case") to preserve his

10 claims because of the possible application of the statute of limitations. The two cases should be

11 consolidated.

12 2. The southern part of Laguna Beach, renowned for its natural beauty, is also home

13 to a number of residences with unique and historic qualities. The City of Laguna Beach (the

14 "City")'s policies seek to preserve both the sensitive environmental and historic resources of this

15 area by requiring that impacts to these resources be thoroughly studied before any development is

16 allowed, policies which are reflected in the City's certified Local Coastal Program ("LCP")

17 regulating coastal development under the California Coastal Act. The City's LCP also contains

18 special provisions incorporating the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act

19 ("CEQA").

20 3. The Commission provides de novo appellate review of the City's decisions to

21 issue coastal development permits ("CDP"s) under the LCP, is and is also a Responsible Agency for

22 such permits under CEQA. This case challenges the Commission's decisions to allow

23 development with significant impacts in this sensitive environmental and coastal area without

24 complying with CEQA and the California Coastal Act, including but not limited to the LCP's

25 legal requirement to prepare an Initial Study ("IS") to assess the development's impacts as

26 required by CEQA, and an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"); impermissibly allowing the

27 project to be segmented to avoid analysis of its cumulative impacts; failing to review the City's

28

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief
la-1379393

1 CEQA violations as a matter of compliance with the City's LCP; and failing to hold a hearing and
2 render a decision that comports with due process.

3 4. The problem began when Real Party in Interest Hany Dimitry applied to the City
4 for a building permit, a Design Review Permit ("DRP"), and a CDP for his proposed development
(collectively, the "Project")' within this environmentally sensitive region. The Project involved
6 demolition of an historic blufftop residence, construction of a new mansion, and other
redevelopment of the property. The City decided to consider the demolition phase separately
co from the rest of the Project, and then exempted the demolition phase from the requirements of
9 CEQA. CEQA is mandatory state law that requires state and local agencies to prepare an IS to
10 preliminarily assess the significant environmental impacts of their actions, and to analyze the
11 impacts of a project as a whole. CEQA forbids segmented review of a project-all reasonably
12 foreseeable aspects of the project must be considered at the outset. The City's LCP further
13 requires that an IS must be prepared for any proposed development, including single-family
14 homes, in environmentally sensitive areas. As a consequence of the City's improper
15 determination that the Project was exempt from CEQA, no IS was prepared or certified as
16 required by law.

17 5. The City thereby issued a CDP that will allow significant impacts and damage to
18 the environment, including but not limited to the following:
19 Demolition and grading activity on an unstable oceanfront bluff within an

20 environmentally sensitive area.

21 Destruction of a unique structure qualifying as an historic resource worthy of
22 special protection under the Laguna Beach Municipal Code ("Municipal Code").
23 6. The City's approval of the CDP, without first conducting the environmental

24 review required by CEQA, was unlawful. The City further committed prejudicial legal errors,
25 We use the term "Project" to refer both to the entire proposed development of Real Party 26 in Interest's property and to the segmented phase of that development allowing demolition of the existing structure.

2 including but not limited to allowing the Project to be segmented so as to avoid a review of the

3 environmental impacts of the Project as a whole; issuing a CDP without requiring e

4 corresponding DRP, as required by the City's LCP; and by approving Mr. Dimitry's CDP

5 application without considering the criteria to make the findings required by the LCP.
7.

6 Petitioner and plaintiff Mark Fudge therefore challenged the City's actions through

7 an appeal to the Commission, and by filing the City Case to comply with the possible application
of the statute of limitations.

8 8.

9 The Commission held a hearing for Petitioner's appeal and the appeal of another

10 member of the public, and found the appeals raised substantial issues regarding compliance with

11 the Coastal Act and the City's certified LCP. But the Commission declined to find that the City's

12 violations of CEQA presented substantial issues, including the City's segmentation of the Project.

13 it The Commission maintains that it cannot review the City's CEQA determination because the City

14 remains the "lead agency" under CEQA, notwithstanding the fact that CEQA compliance is
required by the City's LCP.

15 9.

16 The trial court subsequently sustained demurrers by the City and Mr. Dimitry to

17 the City Case without leave to amend, holding that the Commission's action had completely

18 replaced the City's action under McAllister v. County of Monterey (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 253.
10.

19 The Commission then held its de novo hearing and approved a CDP for just the

20 demolition phase of the Project, over the objections of Petitioner and members of the public. The

21 Commission refused to address the Project's illegal segmentation or to require an IS, as mandated

22 by CEQA and the LCP. The Commission also failed to apply an LCP provision qualifying the

23 demolition as a "major remodel" that requires removal of existing non-conforming development

24 on the property. The Commission further failed to require Mr. Dimitry to obtain a DRP to

25 accompany the CDP, as required by the LCP. The Commission failed to adequately study the

26 relevant documents or to take the time necessary to consider its decision.
11.

27 The Commission voted to issue the CDP without substantial evidence that it

28 analyzed the project in compliance with CEQA. It subsequently failed to issue the required

3 CEQA statute of limitations by its filing with the Secretary of Resources.
12. These actions failed to follow the law, lacked substantial evidence in support, and
constituted prejudicial abuses of discretion. For each of these reasons, the Commission's
decisions should be set aside and a writ of mandate issued to
reconsider its decision in accordance with the law. compel the Commission to

7 PARTIES

8 13. Petitioner and plaintiff Mark Fudge owns property and lives in the affected
neighborhood of Laguna Beach. He lives and works in the area

10 around the proposed Project. He

11 will be directly impacted and injured in fact if the proposed Project is exempted or otherwise not

12 required to comply with the rule of law, including but not limited to the preparation of and

13 required public process for an IS and an EIR for the proposed Project.
14. Respondent and defendant Commission is a state
14 agency created and acting under

15 the laws of the State of California, including but not limited to the California Coastal Act and the

16 Commission's administrative regulations. Respondent and defendant John Ainsworth is named in

17 his official capacity as Executive Director of the Coastal Commission to insure the ability to

18 effectuate the relief sought or otherwise ordered by the Court in this case. The Commission has
the

19 power to sue and be sued. (Pub. Resources Code, § 30334, subd. (b).)
15.

20 Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Respondents and

21 Defendants sued herein as DOES 1 through 25, and therefore sues Respondents and Defendants

22 by such fictitious names pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 474. Petitioner will amend

23 this Complaint and Petition to allege the true names and capacities when the same are ascertained.

24 Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that DOES 1 through 25 are

25 individuals, elected or appointed officials, public agencies, corporations, associations, groups, or

26 other entities responsible in some manner for the actions complained of herein or which

27 contributed to the injury suffered by Petitioner. Whenever in this Complaint and Petition any

28 allegation is made against the named Respondents and Defendants, it shall be deemed alleged
against DOES 1 through 25 as well.

L JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2 16. The Orange County Superior Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to

3 California Constitution, Article VI, section 10; Public Resources Code sections 21168, 21168.5,

4 30801, and 30803, subdivision (a); and Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5.

5 17.

6 Venue is proper in Orange County because an action "[a]gainst a public officer ...
for an act done by the officer in virtue of the office .. ." is properly brought in "the county in

7 which the cause, or some part of the cause, arose, . ..", and here the cause arose in Orange

8 County. (Code Civ. Proc., § 393, subd. (b).)

9 18.

10 Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to the filing of this petition and
complaint and otherwise exhausted all administrative remedies in satisfaction of Public Resources

11 Code section 21177, including but not limited to appearing before the City and Commission,

12

13 presenting objections and submitting comments on the proposed Project, as well as on the
agencies' permits, approvals, procedures and authorizations. Petitioner complied with Public

14

15 Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 by mailing a copy of
this Petition to the California Attorney General, a true and correct copy of which is attached

16

17 hereto as Exhibit B. Petitioner further complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by

18 mailing a written notice of commencement of this action to Respondents prior to filing this
Petition, a true and correct copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit C.

19 STATUTORY BACKGROUND

20 A. California Coastal Act

21 19. On January 1, 1977 Division 20 of the California Public Resources Code

22 (§§ 30000 et seq.), known as the California Coastal Act of 1976, became effective ("Coastal

23 Act"). The Coastal Act created the Commission. The Coastal Act also created a planning

24

25 process to ensure that development of property in a "coastal zone" is consistent with and reflects

26 the findings and declarations made by the legislature as stated in Public Resources Code section

30001:

27 (a) That the California coastal zone is a distinct and valuable natural resource of vital

28 and enduring interest to all the people a and exists as a delicately balanced

5

la-1379393 Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

- ecosystem.

2 (b)

3 That the permanent protection of the state's natural and scenic resources is a

4 paramount concern to present and future residents of the state and nation.
(c)

5 That to promote the public safety, health and welfare, and to protect public and

6 private property, wildlife marine fisheries and other ocean resources, and the

7 natural environment, it is necessary to protect the ecological balance of the coastal
zone and prevent its deterioration and destruction.

8 (d)

9 That existing developed uses, and future developments that are carefully planned

10 and developed consistent with the policies of [the Coastal Act], are essential to the

11 economic and social well-being of the people of this state and especially to

12 working persons employed within the coastal zone.

13 The Coastal Act specifies that "this division shall be liberally construed to accomplish its
purposes and objectives." (Pub. Resources Code, § 30009.)
14 20.

15 The "coastal zone" is that land specified on maps identified and set forth in section

16 17 of Chapter 1330 of the Statutes of 1975-1976 Regular Session enacting Division 20 of the

17 Public Resources Code and subsequent amendments. In significant coastal estuarine, habitat, and

18 recreational areas it extends inland to the first major ridge line paralleling the sea or five miles

19 from the mean high tide line of the sea, whichever is less, and in developed urban areas the zone

20 generally extends inland less than 1,000 yards. (Pub. Resources Code, § 30103, subd. (a).)
21.

21 The Coastal Act defines "Development" to include "the construction,

22 reconstruction, demolition, or alteration of the size of any structure .." (Pub. Resources Code,

23 § 30106; see also Municipal Code, § 25.07.006, subd. (D) [identical definition in LCP].)
22. The Coastal Act requires the permitting agency
24 to assess the cumulative impacts of

25 future development when making a permit decision: "[c]umulatively or cumulative effect means

26 the incremental effects of an individual project shall be reviewed in connection with the effects of

27 past projects, the effects of other current projects, and the effects of probable future projects."

28 (Pub. Resources Code, § 30105.5.) The Coastal Act further requires that:

6

la-1379393 Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

- New residential, commercial, or industrial development . . . shall be located within,

2 contiguous with, or in close proximity to, existing developed areas able to

3 accommodate it or, where such areas are not able to accommodate it, in other areas

4 with adequate public services and where it will not have significant adverse

5 effects, either individually or cumulatively, on coastal resources.

6 (Id. at § 30250, subd. (a), emphasis added.)

7 23.

8 Local agencies like the City are required to prepare a LCP to regulate local coastal

9 zone development, consisting of land use plans, zoning ordinances, zoning district maps, and

10 other implementing actions that satisfy the Coastal Act. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 30108.6,

11 30500.) Once the LCP is certified by the Commission, the local agency is responsible for

12 reviewing all coastal zone development, including issuance of CDPs. (Id. at 30519, subd. (a);
City of Half Moon Bay v. Superior Court (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 795, 804.)

13 24.

14 The Commission retains appellate authority over CDPs approved by the local

15 government. (Pub. Resources Code, § 30603.) The grounds for an appeal to the Commission are

16 limited to allegations that the proposed development does not conform to the standards in the

17 LCP or the public access policies of the Coastal Act. (Id. at subd. (b)(1).) The Commission must
hear the appeal unless it determines there is no "substantial issue" relating to the grounds on

18

19 which the appeal has been filed. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 13115, subd. (b).) If the

20 Commission finds a substantial issue, it conducts a de novo hearing on the substantial issues
raised by the appeal. (Pub. Resources Code, § 30621, subd. (a); Charles A. Pratt Construction

21

22 Co., Inc. V. California Coastal Com. (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 1068, 1075.) The Commission may

23 approve, modify, or deny a proposed development. (Pub. Resources Code, § 30625, subd. (a).)

25.

24 The Project is located in the coastal zone and therefore requires a CDP to'ensure
consistency with the City's LCP. (Pub. Resources Code, § 30600, subd. (a).)

25 B.

26 CEQA Requires a Comprehensive Analysis of the Environmental Impacts of a Proposed Project as a Whole and Mitigation of Those Impacts Before the Project is Approved.
27 26.

28 In addition to the above requirements, the Commission must also comply with
CEQA, which calls for full environmental review of any discretionary governmental decision

7

la-1379393 Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 with the potential to affect the environment. CEQA also mandates public involvement in the

2 environmental review process.

3 27. A public agency shall prepare the appropriate environmental document under
4 CEQA before approving or carrying out any project that may have an impact on the physical
5 environment. (See Pub. Resources Code, § 21002.)

6 28. For CEQA's purposes, a "project" means "the whole of an action, which has a

7 potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably

8 foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment . . .." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15378,
9 subd. (a).)

10 29. Where an agency determines that a project's environmental impacts may be
11 significant and unavoidable, the agency shall prepare, circulate for public review and comment,
12 and certify an EIR. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21151.)

13 30. An EIR must contain an accurate and complete description of the project to be
14 approved or carried out, as well as the potential environmental impacts thereof. (Pub. Resources
15 Code, §§ 21061, 21100; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15124.) Where impacts may be significant, an
16 EIR must consider alternatives and mitigation measures. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21002.)
17 31. CEQA is "integral" to agency decision making. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21006.)
18 The purpose of an EIR is to disclose the potential environmental impacts of a project to the public
19 and decision makers to allow them to make an informed decision on the project. Accordingly,
20 public participation in the CEQA process, particularly through comments on an EIR, is critically
21 important. For all these reasons, the failure to prepare environmental review documents before
22 decision makers take action on a project vitiates the fundamental purpose of CEQA.
23 32. Where environmental impacts of a project may be significant, an agency must
24 adopt certain findings before approving the project. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21081.)
25 33. All conclusions and actions under CEQA must be supported by substantial
26 evidence in the record. (See, e.g., Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21081.5, 21082.2, 21168, 21168.5;
27 Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, §§ 15064, 15091, 15162, 15164, 15384.)

- 34.

2 The Commission's regulatory program has been certified by the Secretary of the

3 Resources Agency as the "functional equivalent" of an EIR under Public Resources Code section

4 21080.5. As such, the Commission has a limited exemption "only from a chapters 3 and 4 of

5 CEQA and from section 21167 of that act." (Sierra Club v. State Bd. of Forestry (1994) 7 Cal.4th 7

6 1215, 1231.) The Commission remains subject to all other CEQA provisions. (Ibid.) "In order

to

7 claim the exemption from CEQA's EIR requirements, an agency must demonstrate strict

8 compliance with its certified regulatory program." (Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish & Game
Com. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 132.)

9 35.

10 The City's LCP contains special provisions that require specific compliance with

11 CEQA's provisions. Actions 7.4.2 and 10.3.1 of the Land Use Element of the City's General

12 Plan both require "preparation of initial studies, pursuant to [CEQA], for any proposed

13 development, including single-family residences located within environmentally sensitive areas."

14 (Emphasis added.) A true and correct copy of these parts of the City's Land Use Element are

15 attached hereto as Exhibit D. Under the LCP, "environmentally sensitive areas are shown on :

16 map adopted by resolution of the city council" (Municipal Code, § 25.50.040), and are listed in

17 the Real Property Report for each parcel (Action 7.4.4, Land Use Element.) The Technical

18 Appendix to the Coastal Land Use Plan, also part of the LCP, explains why coastal bluffs and

19 oceanfront property are considered "environmentally sensitive areas" under the LCP:

20 [T]he coastal bluffs constitute : fragile natural resource particularly susceptible to

21 damage and destruction. . [a geologic study of the coastal bluffs] was largely

22 responsible for the designation of coastal bluffs and adjacent ocean front property

23 as "Environmentally Sensitive Areas." Much like natural watercourses and

24 habitats, which also appear on the city's "Environmentally Sensitive Area Map,"

25 private or public development projects proposed on bluff top property must

26 undergo special review procedures and detailed design standards, including site

27 planning requirements and design review, setback provisions and compliance with

28 provisions of the City's Zoning Ordinance, Geology Ordinance and Excavation
and Grading Ordinance. This special review procedure is symbolic of the sensitive

9

la-1379393 Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

L

2 nature of coastal bluffs and surrounding environments and reflects the city's
commitment to preserving this unique resource.

3

4 (Technical Appendix, Coastal Land Use Plan (August, 1984) at page 52.)
36.

5 The Municipal Code also provides that a CDP cannot be approved unless the

6 approving authority makes a specific finding that "[t]he proposed development will not have any

7 significant adverse impacts on the environment within the meaning of [CEQA]." (Municipal

8 Code, § 25.07.012, subd. (G)(3).) A true and correct copy of this Municipal Code provision is
attached hereto as Exhibit E.

9 37.

10 The Commission is bound by these provisions because they are also part of the

11 City's LCP. (Pub. Resources Code, § 30603, subd. (b)(1); Security National Guaranty, Inc. v.

12 California Coastal Commission (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 402, 421.)

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

13 A. The Proposed Project.

14 38.

15 The proposed Project is to demolish an 86 year-old existing house at 31987 Coast

16 a Highway, build a new three-story single-family residence and attached garage on the same lot,

17 and obtain a variance for maintaining i non-conforming driveway gradient. The house is located

18 on the face of a bluff overlooking the ocean, in a designated "Seismic Hazard Landslide Area.»

19 The Project is geographically near to known archeological site P-30-000842 at 31461 Coast

20 Highway, and as a result there is a strong possibility that the Project site also possesses
archeological and paleontological significance.

21 39.

22 A Real Property Report for the Project site shows that the property is within a

23 "Mapped Environmentally Sensitive Area" for the following factors: "Coastal Property/Water

24 Quality Environmentally Sensitive Area/Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone."

40.

25 41. Mr. Dimitry has owned the subject property since April 7, 2016.

26 On April 1, 2016, Mr. Dimitry submitted a Development Review Application to

27 the City for construction of a new 6,800 square foot house and 600
subject property. square foot garage on the

28

10

la-1379393 Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 42. On April 18, 2016, City Planner Evan Jedynak prepared a "Pre-Application Site
2 Development Review Meeting Evaluation." The Evaluation found that a CDP is required for the

3 Project because it is a new residence on an oceanfront lot. It "encouraged the applicant to have a
historic analysis prepared in order to determine if the structure warrants special preservation
consideration as an historic resource." The Evaluation also noted that the proposed development

6 was in an environmentally sensitive area and referenced the factors listed in the Real Property
7 Report described above.

8 43. On or about July 1, 2016, Mr. Dimitry submitted a new Development Review

9 Application for the Project, Application No. ZPC-2016-1475. This application sought to

10 demolish the existing home and garage, construct a new 7,058.3 square foot house and a 402.6

11 square foot garage, replace landscape and hardscape at the building pad, and construct shoring at

12 the side property lines.

13 44. Mr. Dimitry's application failed to include some of the elements required by
14 Municipal Code section 25.07.012, subdivision (C), including the requirement of submitting a site
15 plan showing existing and proposed topography and major landscape features. It was thus illegal
16 for the City to act upon the incomplete application.

17 B. The Design Review Board Segments the Project, Denies the CDP Application,
18 and Orders an Initial Study of the Existing Residence's Historicity.

19 45. On July 20, 2016, the City sent a letter to Mr. Dimitry's architect listing additional
20 information and requirements that were required for Mr. Dimity's application. In Item 9,
21 "Required Entitlements," the letter stated that the Project required Design Review Board approval
22 and a CDP for the new structure, elevated decks, chimney height, grading retaining walls, pool,

23 spa, AC unit, metal fencing, landscaping, and construction in an environmentally sensitive area.

24 The letter also cited the property's potential historic significance as an "Issue of Concern," and

25 reiterated the request that Mr. Dimitry have a historic analysis prepared for the property.
26 46. Mr. Dimitry responded to this request on August 16, 2016, providing additional
27 information in the form of a Coastal Hazard Analysis Report that analyzed the effects of sea level

la-1379393

1 rise and erosion, but did not address the City's concerns regarding development in an
2 environmentally sensitive area and the possible historical value of the home.

3 47. On September 1, 2016, the City's zoning division sent a letter to Mr. Dimitry's
architect. The letter stated that the Development Application was still incomplete and that
additional information and requirements were needed. The letter again identified as "Issues of

6 Concern" that the Project involved construction in an environmentally sensitive area and

7 demolition of a home with potential value as a historic resource.

8 48. On October 24, 2016, an architecture firm called Historic Resources Group
released an Historic Assessment ("HRG Report") of the existing home for potential historic
10 significance and eligibility for listing in the local historic register. The HRG Report stated that
11 the home was built in 1930 and was likely the first permanent residence constructed in the Three
12 Arches Palisades No. 2 subdivision. The HRG Report also found that the existing house is unlike
13 the surrounding beach cottages because it has remained relatively unaltered since its construction,
14 and as such it retains most character-defining features of its original Spanish Colonial Revival
15 design.

16 49. Based on the criteria set forth in the City's Historic Preservation Ordinance
17 (Municipal Code, 25.45), the HRG Report found that the structure appears eligible for
18 designation in the local historic register with a "K" (Key) rating. A "K" rating is reserved for
19 buildings that strongly maintain their original integrity and demonstrate a particular architectural
20 style or time period.
21 50. On November 9, 2016, an environmental consulting firm called LSA Associates
22 prepared a peer review memorandum for Mr. Dimitry's architect. The peer review criticized the
23 HRG Report's research and analysis, but ultimately LSA conceded that the HRG Report was
24 otherwise legally sufficient as a basis for finding of historicity. LSA also stated that it believes
25 the house is more "eclectic" than representing particular architectural style. But LSA agreed
26 with the HRG Report that the property otherwise retains a high level of integrity, most
27 importantly with respect to materials, workmanship, and design.

L 51. On December 15, 2016, Petitioner submitted a letter to the

2 Design Review Board

3 that objected to the use of a Categorical Exemption to CEQA for the Project because it is located
in an environmentally sensitive area.

4 52.

5 On January 2, 2017, Laurence Nokes, Mr. Dimitry's attorney, sent an email to the to

6 City. In the email, Mr. Nokes stated that the Project implicated historic resources and
preservation of the environmentally sensitive bluffs.

7 53.

8 Mr. Nokes sent another email to the City on January 9, 2017. The email asked the

9 Design Review Board to find that the house is not historic and that it proceed with its design
review assessment of the new design.

10 54. In the same email, Mr. Nokes

11 proposed that, if the Design Review Board had a

12 "hang up" with regard to historicity of the property, then that issue should be bifurcated from the
rest of the Project approvals and considered alone by the City Council.
13 55.

14 CEQA expressly prohibits such a segmented approach to a project because it
avoids environmental review for the project as a
15 whole. The lead agency must consider the whole
of an action, not simply its constituent parts, when determining whether it will have a significant
16 environmental effect. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15003, subd. (h).) If a project has aspects that
17

18 are ministerial as well as discretionary, the entire project must be viewed as discretionary and

19 subject to CEQA. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21080, 21083; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15268,
subd. (d).)

20 56.

21 The Design Review Board's staff prepared a Staff Report for Project's hearing on

22 January 12, 2017. The Report responded to Mr. Dimitry's claim that the Project is categorically

23 exempt from CEQA under "Class 3(a) -new construction" by observing that the exemption
would only apply if the existing residence is not an historic resource.

24 57.

25 Based on the existing historic analysis reports, staff stated that it believes the

26 existing residence may be an historic resource. Staff recommended that if the Design Review

27 Board determines the existing house is an historic resource, then an IS should be prepared.
58.

28 The Staff Report identified Mr. Dimitry's "Requested Action" as design review
and a CDP to demolish and construct a home "in an environmentally sensitive area (oceanfront)."
13

la-1379393 Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 59. The Staff Report also noted that the Project did not satisfy a number of mandatory
2 design review criteria, including excessive grading in an environmentally sensitive area.

3 60. Members of the public, including Mr. Dimitry's neighbors, voiced objections to
4 the Project at the January 12, 2017 Design Review Board hearing. They protested that the

5 existing house has historic value, that the new house is overly massive and will obstruct view

6 corridors, and that removal of dirt and grading would potentially compromise the integrity of the
7 hillside.

8 61. After considering the staff report and the other available evidence, the Design
9 Review Board voted 4-1 that the Project "meets the criteria that this Board deems for an historic

10 initial study."

11 62. The Design Review Board then voted 5-0 to deny the application for the new
12 structure. It found that the new design was not compatible with the neighborhood, would obstruct
13 views from the neighborhood, would be detrimental to the historic context of the area, creates
14 privacy issues for the neighboring property, presents environmental concerns, is overly massive,
15 and would involve excessive grading.

16 63. By dividing the Project into two stages and having separate votes on each, the
17 Design Review Board segmented the Project in violation of CEQA. CEQA requires that analysis
18 of a project's environmental impacts assess the project as a whole, not in smaller pieces. (Cal.
19 Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15378, subd. (a).)

20 C. The City Council Rejects the Design Review Board's Conclusions, and Issues
21 the Segmented CDP, in Violation of CEQA and the Municipal Code.

22 64. On January 24, 2017, Mr. Dimitry submitted a "Notice of Appeal" of the DRB's
23 decision. The Notice stated the following grounds for the appeal:
24 Relief from the DRB's requirement that the structure on 31987 Coast Highway be
25 subject to an initial study and/or EIR to determine "historicity." The property was
26 not listed on the inventory and no notice of "historicity" was provided in the City-
27 issued RPR prior to Appellant's purchase. No reference of potential "historicity"
28 was suggested during the predevelopment site inspection.

14
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief la-1379393

- 65.

2 City staff prepared an Agenda Bill (essentially a Staff Report for the City Council)

3 for the appeal to the City Council, which refuted Mr. Dimitry's contentions.
66.

L

5 City staff found the fact that the property was not listed on the historic registry did
not preclude a finding of historicity because CEQA allows the City to find that a project may have

6 a significant impact on an historic resource based on substantial evidence in the record. (Pub.

7 Resources Code, § 15064.5, subd. (a)(4).) Furthermore, Municipal Code section 25.50.040,

8 subdivision (H)(6) states that special preservation consideration should be given to structures over
45 years old.

9 67.

10 The Agenda Bill stated: "Based on the evidence presented in the historic analysis

11 reports, particularly the updated HRG Historic Resource Assessment, staff believes that the

12 existing residence may be a historic resource."

68.

13 The Agenda Bill then presented the City Council with four options. It

14 recommended that the Council first determine whether the Design Review Board abused its

15 discretion in determining that the existing residence is an historic resource. If the Council

16 determined that the Board had abused its discretion and granted the appeal, it could cither (1)

17 determine the property is not historic and remand the Project to the Board, or (2) it could overturn
the Board's decision and

18 approve the Project (which would require the Council to make the

19 required findings for Design Review, the CDP, and make an appropriate CEQA determination).

20 On the other hand, if the Council determined that the Board did not abuse its discretion and

21 rejected the appeal, it could either (1) require preparation of an IS, or (2) sustain the Board's

22 decision to deny the Project.

69.

23 The Agenda Bill also confirmed the standard of review that the City Council

24 would apply in reviewing the DRB's decision, citing the Municipal Code. Municipal Code

25 section 25.05.070, subdivision (B)(9)(e) provides:

26 The hearing by the city council of appeals of a decision on a design review

27 application shall be limited to the grounds specifically stated in the underlying

28 notice(s) of appeal(s). There shall be a presumption that the decision made by the
approval authority was reasonable, valid and not an abuse of discretion; and the

15

la-1379393 Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

n appellant shall have the burden of proof of demonstrating otherwise by a
2 preponderance of the evidence presented.32

3 The Agenda Bill further stated that "[t]he City Council does not conduct a de novo hearing, does

4 not reweight the evidence, and does not exercise its independent judgment on the evidence."

5 70. For the CDP, the Agenda Bill instructed that a CDP application may only be

6 approved after the approving authority has reviewed the development project and made the

7 findings required by the Municipal Code for a CDP. (Municipal Code, § 25.07.012, subd. (G).)
8 These findings are that the Project (I) complies with all applicable provisions of the General Plan,
9 (2) conforms to the LCP and public access/recreation policies of Chapter 3 of the Coastal Act, and
10 (3) will not have any significant adverse impacts on the environment within the meaning of
11 CEQA. (Ibid.) As stated above, the Design Review Board was unable to make these findings and
12 SO denied the application for a CDP.

13 71. Finally, the Agenda Bill noted that the City Council would have to make a CEQA
14 determination if they decided to approve the Project. The City Council would either have to
15 determine that an exemption applied, or take some other action (such as directing preparation of
16 an IS).

17 72. The Agenda Bill recommended that the City Council "[d]eny the appeal and
18 sustain the Design review Board denial of Design Review 16-2179, Coastal Development Permit
19 16-2180, and Variance 16-2178 at 31987 Coast Highway."
20 73. Along with the Agenda Bill, City staff presented the Council with an April 10,
21 2017 letter from a consultant called Environmental Science Associates ("ESA") to Mr. Nokes
22 regarding the historical attributes of the existing home. The letter criticized some aspects of the
23 City's application process, but it also stated that ESA had conducted a separate analysis in 2016
24 that generally concurred with the findings by HRG and LSA that the existing house was
25

26 2 Like all of Title 25 of the City's Municipal Code, this provision is part of the City's certified LCP and is thus enforceable by the Commission.
27

p

2 potentially an historic resource. The April 10 ESA letter ultimately comes to the same conclusion

3 as the other two reports: the existing house may be eligible for historical protection.
74.

4 The City Council's consideration of this letter, submitted after the Design Review

5 Board hearing, was illegal. As stated above, the City Council reviews the Design Review Board's

6 decision to determine whether the Board abused its discretion--it does not exercise independent

7 judgment or re-weigh the evidence. (Municipal Code, § 25.05.070, subd. (B)(9)(e).) The City

8 Council appeal hearing is not de novo, so it cannot consider evidence that was not considered by
the Design Review Board at the lower level.

9 75.

10 The City Council held its hearing on Mr. Dimity's appeal on April 18, 2017. In

11 the middle of public testimony, Councilmember Dicterow asked City Attorney Philip Kohn what

12 standard of review the Council used to review an appeal of a Design Review Board decision. Mr.

13 Kohn replied, erroneously, that review of the DRB decision was de novo. The City thus applied

14 the wrong standard of review. (Municipal Code, § 25.05.070, subd. (B)(9)(e).)
76.

15 Public testimony was taken from both proponents and opponents of Mr. Dimitry's

16 appeal. Some of Mr. Dimitry's neighbors objected to the proposed Project, noting the property's

17 historic value and the potential negative impacts of the proposed new construction on views and

18 character of the neighborhood. Petitioner exhausted his administrative remedies by relying on his

19 December 15, 2016 letter to the Design Review Board (now in the record of the Board's decision

20 that was considered by the City Council), in which he objected to the use of a CEQA categorical
exemption for the Project.
21 77.

22 Mr. Dimitry's architect submitted a one-page document to the City Council during

23 the hearing. This document contained photo comparisons of the existing structure with examples

24 of various architectural styles. The architect used this document to argue that the existing

25 structure has no value as an historic resource because it is not an example of Spanish Colonial
Revival Design.

26 78.

27 During the City Council's deliberations, Councilmembers Dicterow and Boyd

28 expressed their personal opinions that the existing structure has no distinctive characteristics or
historic value. Councilmember Dicterow stated that he found the architect's one-page submission
17

la-1379393 Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

-

2 to be "unrebutted," despite the fact that all three expert assessments of the property had concluded

3 that the residence may, at a minimum, qualify for historic preservation, and none had concluded
it that it was not historic.

4 79.

5 Councilmember Zur Schmiede stated that he would like the Project to "go through
the process" of an IS and make a determination of historical value from that

6 study. He also said

7 he did not think the City Council was "doing anyone any favors by shortcutting the CEQA

process."

8 80.

9 In response to a question from Councilmember Whalen, the City's CEQA attorney

10 Ms. Kathy Jensen stated that to her knowledge no issues besides historicity had been raised that

11 would preclude a CEQA exemption for the Project. Ms. Jensen's comment was wrong-as

12 discussed above, the City's LCP and General Plan require that an IS be prepared for this Project

13 because it is located in an environmentally sensitive area. Petitioner raised this issue in a

14 December 15, 2016 letter to the City, and the letter was thus in the record before the City Council
when it made its decision.

15 81.

16 The City Council then discussed skipping an IS and going directly to preparation

17 of an EIR. Mayor Iseman stated her belief that, regardless of the house's historicity, it would

18 need to be demolished for safety reasons. She then said that she "would have a very hard time

19 requiring something as significant as an EIR when we already know what the end result is ....I
already know

20 but I am not a lawyer." She then asked City Attorney Kohn "Phil, how can we

21 get there knowing this house is not livable?" Mr. Kohn replied: "What ] think you're saying is

22 a that there is a desire to not engage in what might be less than valuable environmental review of

23 the project that could only occur if [the] Council says there's not substantial evidence in the

24 record presented this evening to support a determination that the structure constitutes a significant
historical resource."

25 82.

26 At the end of the meeting, Councilmember Dicterow made a motion to uphold the

27 appeal and overturn the Design Review Board's denial of the CDP. There was no discussion of a

28 CEQA categorical exemption, nor did the City Council consider whether an exemption would be
barred by one of the exceptions listed in Public Resources Code section 15300.2. The design

18

la-1379393 Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

2 review and variance applications were not mentioned, nor did the City address the segmentation

3 of the demolition phase from construction of the new home. The motion was carried by a 3-2
vote, and the meeting was adjourned immediately thereafter.
s 83.

5 At no time during the City Council's April 18 hearing did the City consider the

6 mandatory criteria for approval of a CDP, as specified in Municipal Code section 25.07.012,
subdivision (F).

7 84.

8 Through the entire application and appeal process, the fact that the Project is

9 located in an environmentally sensitive area was uncontested. The City's decision to issue a CDP

10 for the Project without ordering an IS violated Actions 7.4.2 and 10.3.1 of the Land Use Element

11 of the City's General Plan, which are also part of the City's LCP.
85.

12 On May 19, 2017, City staff accepted Mr. Dimitry's revised plans for construction

13 of a new home and began reviewing them separately from the demolition phase. The City

14 assigned the same permit number to the proposed new home, CDP 16-2180, as for the demolition
phase.

15 86.

16 On May 23, 2017, the City Council held a meeting to adopt a resolution entitled
"A RESOLUTION OF THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY

17 OF LAGUNA BEACH,

18 CALIFORNIA, OVERTURNING THE DECISION OF THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD,

19 APPROVING COASTAL DEVELOPMENT PERMIT 16-2180 AND CATEGORICAL

20 EXEMPTION, AND ALLOWING THE DEMOLITION OF A SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING
AT 31987 COAST HIGHWAY."

21 87.

22 The Resolution purported to "resolve and order" the following:

23 Overturn the Design Review Board decision and approve the CDP to demolish the

24 existing dwelling based on the City's finding that the house "is not an historic

resource."

25

26 Find that the CDP is in conformity with applicable provisions of the General Plan

27 and LCP, in that the environmentally sensitive oceanfront bluff area will be

28 protected because the development is limited to demolition of the existing

structure.

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and 19

la-1379393 Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

2 Find that the Project will not have any significant impacts on the environment

3 within the meaning of CEQA, in that the Project complies with the applicable rules
and regulations in the Municipal Code.

4 88.

Un The last sentence of the Resolution reads: "The City Council further determines

6 that the proposed project qualifies for a categorical exemption for purposes of the California

7 Environmental Quality Act." The Resolution never identifies which categorical exemption is
being applied.

8 89.

9 During the May 23 hearing, Mr. Greg Pfost, the City's Director of Community

10 Development, stated that a detailed demolition plan would be reviewed and that a geo-technical

11 evaluation would be conducted prior to demolition. The plain implication of Mr. Pfost's words is

12 that the applicant had not submitted these plans, in violation of the Municipal Code. (Municipal
Code, §§ 25.07.012, subd. (C), (G).)

13 90.

14 Members of the public gave testimony at the hearing. One of Mr. Dimitry's

15 neighbors objected that the City was not going through the proper CEQA process for historic

16 resources. Sharon Fudge also spoke and objected to the use of a categorical exemption because

17 the Project is in an environmentally sensitive area. She also noted Petitioner's prior objection to

18 the use of such an exemption, and asked the City Council exactly which exemption was being

19 applied. Finally, she distributed to the City Council a copy of Petitioner's December 15, 2016

20 letter to the Design Review Board objecting to the use of a CEQA categorical exemption for the
Project.

21 91.

22 Petitioner also spoke and observed that it was inappropriate for the City to make a

23 decision on the Project when, based on Mr. Pfost's earlier testimony, the Director of Community
Development did not even know what the Project entailed.

24 92.

25 During the hearing, Mr. Nokes stated that Mr. Dimitry had submitted their design

26 review plans for the new home already. The City's acceptance of these plans was illegal: the

27 Municipal Code provides that an applicant may not submit new Design Review plans until at least

28 two months have lapsed from denial of the application. (Municipal Code, § 25.05.040, subd.
(K).)

20

la-1379393 Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 93. Councilmember Zur Schmeide stated that he did not believe a categorical

2 exemption was the proper CEQA process, and that this Project "was a classic case of

3 piecemealing." Councilmember Whalen concurred.

4 94. Councilmember Dicterow then moved to adopt the Resolution. The vote was 3-2

5 against adopting the Resolution. City Attorney Kohn immediately called a closed session of the

6 City Council.

7 95. When the City Council reconvened, Councilmember Whalen stated that the action

8 before the Council was not a vote on the merits of the issue, but was rather a ministerial vote as to

9 whether the Resolution accurately reflected the events at the April 18 meeting. If the Council did

10 not approve the resolution, Councilmember Whalen said, there would be significant exposure to
11 litigation for the City.

12 96. The City Council ultimately reconsidered its vote and adopted the Resolution by a
13 4-1 vote.

14 97. By considering issues beyond the historical value of the existing house, which
15 were the only grounds stated in Mr. Dimitry's appeal, the City acted illegally. (Municipal Code
16 25.05.070, subd. (B)(9)(e).)

17 98. On May 30, 2017, the City sent a "Notice of Final Action for Coastal Development
18 Permits" ("NOFA") to the California Coastal Commission.

19 99. On June 6, 2017, the Coastal Commission sent the NOFA back, deeming it
20 deficient and requesting a copy of the Resolution.

21 100. Also on June 6, 2017, the City filed a Notice of Exemption with the Orange
22 County clerk's office.

23 101. On June 12, 2017, the City sent a new NOFA to the Coastal Commission, which
24 was received on June 14. On June 16, 2017, the Coastal Commission sent a "Notification of

25 Appeal Period" to the City. Because the Coastal Commission received the NOFA on June 14, the

26 deadline to appeal the City's decision to the Coastal Commission was June 28, 2017 at 5:00 p.m.

102. On June 27, 2017, Mr. Dimitry's neighbor Mr. Derek Peterson filed an appeal with
2 the Coastal Commission. On June 28, 2017, Petitioner also filed an appeal with the Coastal

3 Commission.

4 D. The Coastal Commission Finds the Appeals Present Substantial Issues, But
5 Refuses to Review the City's CEQA Violations or Some of its LCP Violations.
103.
6 Petitioner's appeal presented eight issues regarding the City's decision for the

7 Commission to review: (1) failure to require an IS for the Project; (2) failure to follow the

8 procedures for a hearing laid out in Municipal Code section 25.05.070; (3) failure to require a

9 DRP with the CDP as provided by Municipal Code section 25.05.040, subdivision (B)(1)(q), to

10 require submission of demolition plans prior to approving the CDP, to consider the criteria
required by Municipal Code section 25.07.012, subdivision (F), to support its decision with 11

12 substantial evidence, and to condition the permit to protect cultural resources (grouped as "Issue

13 3" for that appeal); (4) segmenting the Project in violation of CEQA; (5) failure to make valid

14 CEQA determination and to apply a proper CEQA exemption; (6) failure to impose permit

15 conditions to avoid or mitigate adverse environmental effects; (7) failure to find the Project

16 involves a "major remodel" under the City's General Plan and therefore requires removal of non-

17 conforming development, and to determine whether the development is on the face of the bluffs

18 and therefore requires consideration of impacts to the bluff face; and (8) failure to update the

19 Municipal Code to conform its language to that of the certified LCP, particularly with regard to

20 "major remodels," "nonconforming buildings and uses," "bluff top setbacks," and portions of the
Land Use Element.
21

22 104. Commission staff released Staff Report on July 27, 2017, recommending that the

23 Commission find the appeals present substantial issues regarding the City's compliance with the

24 Coastal Act and the LCP. The Staff Report found the following substantial issues: (1) the extent

25 of the Project (and therefore the extent of its impact) is unclear because no plans are included in

26 the record and no conditions were imposed regarding removal of unpermitted development on the

27 bluff face; (2) inadequate evaluation of hazards associated with development on a bluff face; (3)

28 inadequate evaluation of impacts on natural resources; (4) inadequate evaluation of impacts on

22
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief la-1379393

L

2 water quality; (5) lack of evidence to support the findings required by Municipal Code section

3 25.07.012, subdivision (G), and failure to impose conditions to enable the City to make those

4 findings; and (6) insufficient information to determine the Project's impacts to public access. For

5 the remaining grounds of Petitioner's appeal, the Staff Report either failed to address the issue or

6 found the issue did not raise a substantial issue, notwithstanding the facts that many of these

7 issues involve compliance with LCP provisions and the Commission is charged with enforcing
the LCP.

8 105.

9 On August 9, 2017, the Commission voted to find the appeal raised substantial
issues and should be reviewed de novo.

10 106.

11 On September 5, 2017, Petitioner sent a letter to the Commission providing

12 comments for its de novo review. The letter reminded the Commission that the LCP requires

13 preparation of an IS under CEQA, so the Commission must enforce this requirement even if it is

14 not the lead agency. The letter requested that the Commission reconsider its decision and find the

15 City's CEQA violation presents a substantial issue of non-conformity with the LCP. The letter

16 went on to explain how the City has engaged in a pattern of wrongfully exempting development

17 projects from CEQA, then using the appeal process to the Commission to argue that the City's

18 action cannot be challenged in court. The Commission never responded to the letter.

E. Petitioner's Lawsuit Against the City.
19 107.

20 Meanwhile, Petitioner filed the City Case to challenge the City's action under

21 CEQA and under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5. The case of McAllister v. County of

22 Monterey (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 253 requires this two-pronged approach of filing both an

23 appeal to the Commission and a lawsuit challenging the City's action. Under that case, if the

24 Commission decides to hold a de novo hearing, that hearing wipes out the City's decision as if it

25 never happened. (Id. at p. 294.) If the Commission decides not to hold a hearing, the petitioner

26 may still pursue a lawsuit against the City under CEQA. However, CEQA's statute of limitations

27 is shorter than the Commission's period to decide whether to hold the hearing, so if a petitioner

28 waits for the Commission's decision they will forfeit their ability to bring a CEQA lawsuit. Thus,

23

la-1379393 Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

-

2 McAllister requires a petitioner to pursue both avenues simultaneously to preserve their rights and
exhaust administrative remedies, which is what Petitioner did here.

3 108. After the Commission found the

4 appeals of the Project presented substantial issues,

5 the City and Mr. Dimitry filed demurrers arguing that the entire lawsuit was moot under

6 McAllister because the Commission would eventually hold a de novo hearing. On November 6,

7 2017, the trial court granted the demurrers without leave to amend, over Petitioner's opposition.

8 Petitioner timely appealed the ruling, and the appeal is currently pending before the Fourth
Appellate District, Division 3 (Appellate Case No. G055711).

F.

10 The Commission Issues its De Novo Decision Without Complying With CEQA, the Coastal Act, or the Certified LCP.

11 109.

12 Commission staff released its De Novo Staff Report on February 23, 2018. The

13 Staff Report recommended that the Commission approve the CDP for demolition only, subject to

14 certain conditions. The Staff Report did not address the City's invalid CEQA determination as a

15 matter of compliance with the LCP, nor did it enforce the LCP's legal requirement that an IS be

16 prepared for the Project or address the segmentation of the demolition phase from the rest of the

17 Project. The Staff Report further failed to address whether the demolition constituted a "major

18 remodel" requiring removal of unpermitted development at the Property, the LCP requirement

19 that a DRP be obtained for any CDP, or the effect of the City's procedural LCP violations.

20 Regarding CEQA, the Staff Report found the Project may have effects on cultural/archaeological
resources, water quality, and erosion, yet it stated:
21

22 As conditioned, there are no feasible alternatives or additional feasible mitigation

23 measures available which would substantially lessen any significant adverse effect

24 which the activity may have on the environment. Therefore, the Commission finds

25 that the proposed project, as conditioned to mitigate the identified impacts, is the

26 least environmentally damaging feasible alternative and complies with the

27 applicable requirements of the Coastal Act to conform to CEQA.

28 This finding violates both CEQA and the LCP. CEQA analysis requires an agency to first
determine if project will have a significant adverse impact, and if so the agency must (1)

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and 24

la-1379393 Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 propose alternatives or mitigation measures, (2) explicitly find that the unmitigated effects are

2 outweighed by the project's benefits, or (3) reject the project. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15252,
3 subd. (a)(2); Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of California (1988) 47
4 Cal.3d 376, 391.) Moreover, the City's LCP requires the Commission to make a finding that
5 "[t]he proposed development will not have any significant adverse impacts on the environment

6 within the meaning of [CEQA]." (Municipal Code, § 25.07.012, subd. (G)(3).)

7 110. Petitioner sent two letters to the Commission staff in response to the Staff Report.
8 The first letter was sent on April 3, 2018, and asked the Commission to address the Project's
9 CEQA issues (including segmentation), whether the demolition qualifies as a "major remodel,"
10 and to require Mr. Dimitry to obtain a DRP from the City per the LCP. The letter also informed
11 the Commission that the City has engaged in a practice of skipping CEQA analysis, then using the
12 Commission's appellate process and the McAllister decision to shield its decision from
13 administrative or judicial review. The second letter on April 11, 2018 informed the Commission
14 to that, contrary to statements in the Staff Report that "[n]o new construction is proposed," Mr.
15 Dimitry had already submitted plans for his proposed new residence to the City. The letter also
16 observed that an ex parte disclosure form filed by Commissioner Sundberg averred that:
17 [t]he Applicant after consultation with CCC Staff has submitted an application for
18 a demolition permit only and if approved will then submit an application for a
19 CDP for a new home. The new home when submitted will be located further

20 inland from the existing home and will be set back further that [sic] the homes on
21 either side of the subject property.

22 (Emphasis added.)

23 111. Commission Staff released an Addendum to the Staff Report on April 12, 2018,
24 purporting to respond to these letters and to a letter from Mr. Dimitry. The Addendum disclaimed
25 the Commission's responsibility to ensure the Project was not segmented or to ensure that CEQA
26 was followed in other respects. It incorrectly found the Project site was not in an

27 "environmentally sensitive area," based on misreading of the City's LCP. It further stated that
28 "the demolition has undergone the required design review process" because the City Council
25

la-1379393 Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 overturned the Design Review Board's decision to deny a DRP, and claimed that no unpermitted

2 development needed to be removed from the property as a result of a "major remodel."

3 112. The Commission held its de novo hearing the next day, April 13, 2018. Petitioner,

4 the other appellant, and several members of the public spoke in opposition to the Project as

5 currently proposed. The Addendum was released without enough time for the Commissioners

6 and the rest of the public to review it, and Petitioner requested the hearing be continued to allow

7 an opportunity for due process notice and review. The request was not granted. Petitioner and

8 the public were only given limited time to speak. They showed the Project was segmented, that

9 there were environmental effects and erosion hazards that had not been adequately addressed in

10 the Staff Report, and that the Commission was required to address the City's failure to follow

11 CEQA. In response, Mr. Dimitry's attorney claimed that there was no segmentation because

12 "there are no crossover issues or overlapping issues with respect to the demolition of the existing

13 house and the construction of a future house ...." He also admitted that "the City staff accepted

14 revised plans for a house" after the demolition was appealed to the Commission. This statement

15 was false-in fact, the City accepted the plans on May 19, 2017, which was after the City Council

16 decided the appeal but before it adopted the Resolution embodying its decision (and before the

17 decision was appealed to the Commission).

18 113. Commission Chairperson Bochco then asked Staff to "explain the segmentation

19 that's in the addendum? Because some of us didn't get a chance to really thoroughly study it." In

20 response, Staff stated:

21 [W]e do think that that makes some sense, to review the demolition at this point in

22 time. If the Commission approves that, then think we expect a future proposal.

23 That would be processed locally and perhaps appealed to the Commission. But if

24 the Commission didn't approve the demolition, then it's an entirely different

25 project outcome.

26 114. The Commission's Chief Counsel, Chris Pederson, then stated:

27 The case of Heinz [sic] v. California Coastal Commission makes it clear

28 that the Commission does not have the authority to be reviewing/evaluating the

26
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief
la-1379393

-

2 correctness of a local government's CEQA review. Our authority under the

3 Coastal Act is to review the local action's compliance with the certified LCP
requirements.

4

5 Now, the Commission does have a certified regulatory program, so that,

6 when an appeal is filed with the Commission, the Commission's review of that

7 appeal satisfies the Commission's obligations under CEQA. But that does not

8 extend to sort of evaluating the adequacy of the CEQA review that the local
government carried out.

9 Then, in terms of the

10 segmentation argument ... [t]he staff report and

11 the addendum does acknowledge that, you know, it's anticipated that there's going

12 to be a future house on the site, that there is a proposal undergoing local review at

13 this point. But the appeal before the Commission is regarding the demolition.
115.

14 Chief Counsel Pederson's statements were incorrect as a matter of law. As

15 demonstrated above, the Commission is required to address the City's CEQA compliance under

16 the LCP, the LCP requires preparation of an IS for the Project, and the Commission is not

17 categorically exempt from CEQA and therefore must address segmentation.
116.

18 Report. The Commission then voted to approve the CDP as described in the de novo Staff

19 117.

20 The Commission failed to issue a Commission Notification of Final Appeal Action

21 to Petitioner for its decision, as required by California Code of Regulations, title 14, section
13120. Instead, the Commission filed a Notice of Decision for the CDP with

22 the Secretary of

23 Resources on April 23, 2018 in an attempt to start running the statute of limitations. This Petition

24 was timely filed within the 30-day period to challenge the decision under California Code of
Regulations, title 14, section 15112, subdivision (c)(3).

Ja-1379393 Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Violation of CEQA and Related Laws Against All Respondents and Defendants)

3 118. Petitioner and Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by this reference each and every
v allegation contained in Paragraphs 1 through 117 of this Petition and Complaint as though fully

5 set forth herein.

6 119. The proposed Project has the potential to result in significant impacts to the
7 physical environment. The Project, among other things, may cause water quality, protected
8 species and habitat, cultural and historic preservation and land use impacts, and impacts related to

9 natural hazards and biological resources, without compliance with applicable law.
10 120. Because the proposed Project may result in significant impacts on the
11 environment, CEQA and the LCP required that the Commission complete the appropriate CEQA
12 review before taking any discretionary action to approve the project or permits for the Project.
13 The Commission violated CEQA by approving the Project without either (1) requiring mitigation
14 of these significant impacts or (2) making an explicit finding that the Project's benefits
15 outweighed its unmitigated impacts.
16 121. As a responsible agency for the Project, the Commission was required to make its
17 own determination as to whether the Project should not be approved because it may cause
18 significant environmental effects under CEQA. The Commission's decision to blindly rely on the
19 City's flawed CEQA determination, instead of performing the work that CEQA requires the
20 responsible agency to do for itself, was illegal.

21 122. The Commission was further required to assess whether the Project was segmented
22 and, if it found segmentation, to either resolve the issue or deny the permit application. The
23 Commission considered the demolition phase of the Project separately from the design of the new
24 residence, even though the new residence was a reasonably foreseeable phase of the Project. As
25 result, no environmental impact review or mitigation was performed for the Project as a whole, as
26 CEQA requires.

27 123. The Commission has issued a CDP for the demolition phase of the Project where
28 there is substantial evidence of a fair argument that the proposed Project may have a significant a

28
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief la-1379393

] impact on the environment, without complying with CEQA. The Commission's decision to issue
2 the CDP lacks substantial evidence that the Commission analyzed the Project in compliance with

3 CEQA.

4 124. In attempting to approve the demolition phase of the Project without first

5 performing proper CEQA analysis, the Commission has acted illegally. Public Resources Code
6 section 21006 states that "CEQA is integral to agency decision making." Accordingly, CEQA
7 and the Coastal Act require the Commission to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of a
8 project before taking action to approve the Project. (See, e.g., Pub. Resources Code, § 21151;
9 Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15164, subd. (d).) Otherwise, CEQA analysis is irrelevant to decision
10 making and CEQA's fundamental purpose would be vitiated.

11 125. The Commission's attempt to issue the CDP without properly analyzing the
12 potential environmental consequences of such action, with the knowledge that the Project is
13 segmented and that the lead agency's use of a CEQA exemption was invalid, must be set aside as
14 a violation of law.

15 126. The Commission's violations of law include but are not limited to its approval of
16 the CDP for Application A-5-LGB-17-0033.

17 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

18 (Against All Respondents and Defendants for Violation of the California Coastal Act and Related Regulations)
19 127. Petitioner and Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by this reference each and every
20 allegation contained in Paragraphs 1 through 126 of this Petition as if fully set forth herein.
21 128. The Commission is required to review the City's approval of the CDP de novo if it
22 finds the appeal presents substantial issues regarding compliance with the LCP and the Coastal
23 Act. Upon making such a finding, the Commission has a mandatory, non-discretionary duty to
24 issue findings of fact and conclusions of law explaining the violations and, if the violations cannot
25 be corrected, to issue a decision denying the CDP.
26 •129. The Commission failed to perform its mandatory, non-discretionary duty in this
27 case. The Commission failed to obey or apply the LCP provisions that require the Commission to
28 follow CEQA's normal procedures, including but not limited to preparation of an IS, preventing

29
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief la-1379393

project segmentation, and making a specific finding that the Project would have no significant

2 adverse environmental impacts within the meaning of CEQA. The Commission's decision to
issue the CDP lacks substantial evidence that it analyzed the Project in compliance with CEQA or

4 the Coastal Act.

5 130. The Commission failed to address the cumulative impacts of probable future

6 development at the Project site, including but not limited to construction of the new home.

7 131. The Commission further failed to obey or apply other LCP provisions, including
8 but not limited to: the procedural rules for the City Council's appeal hearing, the requirement that

9 a DRP be obtained for every CDP, and the requirement that a demolition of 50% or more of a
10 structure is a "major remodel" requiring removal of non-conforming development.

11 132. The Commission further failed to issue a Commission Notification of Final Appeal

12 Action to Petitioner, as required by California Code of Regulations, title 14, section 13120.
13 133. The Commission's violations of law include but are not limited to its approval of
14 the CDP for Application A-5-LGB-17-0033.
15 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

16 (Against All Respondents and Defendants for Administrative Mandamus-Violations of Due Process, Administrative Regulations, and Municipal Code)
17 134. Petitioner and Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by this reference each and every

18 allegation contained in Paragraphs 1 through 133 of this Petition as if fully set forth herein.

19 135. The Commission proceeded in excess of its jurisdiction and abused its discretion

20 by failing to proceed in the manner required by law, by issuing decisions that are not supported by
21 the findings, and by making findings that are not supported by the evidence, including but not
22 limited to the following:

23 136. The Commission held a hearing and rendered a decision that violated Petitioner

24 and the public's right to due process of law. The problems with the Commission's de novo
25 hearings on appeal are systemic and endemic. As another Superior Court recently found:

26 [Coastal Commissioners] are presented a few days before hearings with literally
27 thousands of pages of dense documents which they must access on the

28 Commission's website, read and consider. These staff reports and addenda are

30
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief la-1379393

-

2 often supplemented at or shortly before the hearings with hundreds of pages of

3 additional material jammed under their hotel room doors the night before a hearing

4 or stacked on the dais at the hearing. Some [Commissioners] were candid in

5 acknowledging they cannot read every page; others claimed they did, but given the

6 volume described, the court observes that this must have been, at most, a cursory

7 review. The court, having read numerous administrative records in its career,

8 suggests that anyone who thinks that all Commissioners are actually studying all of
the voluminous materials presented is simply fooling herself/himself. This

6 11 problem is exacerbated by the clear testimony that Commission meetings often last
12-16 hours per day. There are 5.5 hours per day of testimony/evidence in an

12 average Superior Court trial, and jurors (even judges) sometimes have a hard time

13 attending for even this period of time. Woe is the lot of applicants or opponents in

14 Coastal Commission hearings when they fall in the second half of a 12 to 16 hour

15 agenda. This is not justice."

17

18 Steve Kinsey et al. (2016, No. 37-2016-028494), p. 24, emphasis added.) A copy of this decision
is attached hereto as Exhibit A.3 In this case, the Commission failed to adequately study the

19

20 documents in the record or take the time necessary to consider its decision. The Commission
further refused Petitioner's

21 request for a continuance to provide the time necessary for a proper
review, and the Commission Chairperson stated that some Commissioners did not have time to

22 adequately review the materials in advance.

137.

23 The Commission approved a Project under CEQA that may have significant

24

25 adverse impacts on the environment without making the findings required by CEQA and the LCP.

26

27 Petitioner understands this is a final decision on these issues (the case is proceeding in phases) because no objections to the order were filed within 15 days pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 3.1590, subdivision (g).

la-1379393 Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

138. The Commission approved a phase of a segmented Project, without any analysis of
2 the Project's effects as a whole, a practice forbidden by CEQA and the Coastal Act.

3 139. The Commission failed to comply with the LCP provisions relating to CEQA,
4 including the requirement to prepare an initial study and the requirement to make the findings
5 required by Municipal Code section 25.07.012, subdivision (G)(3). The Commission's decision

6 lacks substantial evidence that it analyzed the Project in compliance with CEQA or the Coastal

7 Act.

8 140. The Commission issued a CDP without an accompanying DRP, as required by the

9 LCP.

10 141. The Commission failed to address the LCP provisions governing CDP appeals to
11 the City Council, including but not limited to the standard of review, the burden of proof,
12 acceptance of new evidence, and the proper issues to be considered.
13 142. The Commission failed to find that the work authorized by the CDP is "major
14 remodel" requiring removal of unpermitted development at the Project site.
15 143. The Commission failed to issue Commission Notification of Final Appeal Action
16 to Petitioner, as required by California Code of Regulations, title 14, section 13120.
17 144. The Commission's violations of law include but are not limited to its approval of
18 the CDP for Application A-5-LGB-17-0033.

19 145. The Commission's actions show it failed to act in accordance with law and

20 prejudicially abused its discretion, including but not limited to decisions unsupported by sufficient
21 findings or substantial evidence. The Commission should be required under Code of Civil
22 Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5 to set aside its decisions and comply with its duties under
23 state law, including administrative regulations and the Municipal Code.
24 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

25 WHEREFORE, Petitioner and Plaintiff prays for the following relief:

APPEARANCES

[Proposed] Statement of Decision Following Bench Trial
Spotlight on Coastal Corruption v. Kinsey, Case No. 2016-28494
Trial: Feb. 27 - March 7, 2018, Dept. 72

1. Overview and Procedural Posture.
This action is principally one for recovery of civil fines under the Public Resources Code. Plaintiff alleges that the defendants all of whom are or were appointed members of the California Coastal Commission violated several statutory proscriptions on "ex parte communications." The application of these statutory provisions has never before been litigated.
The complaint was filed August 17, 2016. It sought civil fines against the defendant commissioners based on a "per violation" imposition, as follows:
Former Commissioner Kinsey: $5,250,000.00 Commissioner Howell: $3,600,000.00 Former Commissioner McClure: $3,150,000.00 Former Commissioner Mitchell: $4,500,000.00 Commissioner Vargas: $5,625,000.00
Defendants demurred to the complaint, urging lack of standing, failure to allege specific facts suggesting a knowing violation of the "ex parte" rules, and uncertainty. ROA 15-16. Defendants also scheduled a motion to strike, but did not file one. ROA 13, 14.
Plaintiff filed, on November 28, 2016, a document entitled "Notice of Plaintiff's Intent to File First Amended Complaint." ROA 17. While this might have been satisfactory prior to January 1, 2016, the Legislature amended Code of Civil Procedure section 472 such that it now requires the amended

DATE: 03/28/2018 MINUTE ORDER Page
DEPT: Exhibit A - Page 36 Calendar No.

CASE TITLE: Spotlight On Coastal Corruption vs Kinsey CASE NO: 37-2016-00028494-CU-MC-CTL [IMAGED]
complaint to be "filed and served no later than the date for filing an opposition to the demurrer." So on December 9, 2016, the court sustained the demurrer with 10 days leave to amend. ROA 22, 27. The first amended complaint (FAC) followed within days. ROA 23. By now it was entitled, in addition to an amended complaint, a petition for a writ of mandate. The relief sought was consistent with the new nomenclature: several species of declaratory relief; an order that the fines be paid to the Coastal Commission; injunctive relief; mandamus relief; and fees and expenses under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.

Defendants demurred again. ROA 28. They again asserted lack of standing. They also asserted that the plaintiff failed to exhaust administrative remedies, and that the FAC "fails to allege specific facts supporting a knowing violation of the Ex Parte Rules.' On February 17, 2017, after full briefing and hearing, the court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend. ROA 49. The court found plaintiff had adequately alleged standing, but that there were shortcomings in the allegations regarding knowing violations of the "ex parte" rules. Id. The second amended complaint (SAC) was filed a few weeks later. ROA 52.
Defendants demurred again, and filed a motion to strike. The demurrer urged two grounds: failure to exhaust and failure to allege specific facts supporting knowing violations of the ex parte rules. ROA 57. The motion to strike attacked standing and sought the striking of references to "statutory penalties other than Public Resources Code section 30820(b).' ROA 56. Following full briefing and a hearing on May 19, 2017, the court overruled the demurrer 65. not initially inclined to do so, the court granted in part and sustained it in part. ROA leave to amend. Ibid. The third amended complaint (TAC) Although was filed on June 6, 2017. ROA 66. It pled a multi-count single cause of action for violation of laws governing ex parte disclosures. It alleged defendants committed well over 100 violations of the Public Resources Code ex parte disclosure rules. TAC, paragraphs 17-19. The relief sought in the TAC was similar to that sought in the SAC. Defendants answered. ROA 67. Less than a month later, defendants filed their motion for summary judgment/adjudication on the TAC. ROA 68-73, 102.
The case had been set for trial in early December, 2017. ROA 48-51. However, the plaintiff approached the court in September 2017 via ex parte application seeking more time to oppose the motion for summary judgment/adjudication. ROA' 78. The court granted the ex parte application, and continued the trial to February, 2018, to facilitate opposition briefing and a hearing on the motion for summary judgment/adjudication. ROA 86-90.
Discovery disputes thereafter arose, but were resolved without court intervention. ROA 91-100; 104-113.

Following full briefing (ROA 102, 114-125) and a hearing on January 19, 2018, the court denied the motion for summary judgment in a detailed ruling. ROA 130. The court found triable issues of fact. In addition, with regard to defendants' argument regarding "substantial compliance" with the ex parte disclosure rules, the court opted for full factual development at trial (so that the reviewing court may have the benefit of a more complete record in determining the several novel issues presented by this case). Ibid. The court also noted the signal purpose of the Coastal Commission ex parte rules: to banish forever the days of the smoke-filled room, where deals are cut and policies determined without meaningful input or participation or even notice to the public. [See Dept. of ABC v. Appeals Board, 40 Cal. 4th 1. 5 (2006)]. The court held this obvious legislative purpose would be undercut if Commissioners could be summarily exonerated from violations of the rules based simply on their written declarations, without the opportunity for cross-examination or a determination regarding demeanor and credibility. ROA 130.

CASE TITLE: Spotlight On Coastal Corruption vs Kinsey CASE NO: 37-2016-00028494-CU-MC-CTL [IMAGED]

Plaintiff thereafter filed, by stipulation, the 4th Amended Complaint. ROA 132, 136. It added two counts alleging that defendants McClure and Mitchell violated Public Resources Code section 30327.5(b) "by accepting illegal gifts." The parties answered ready at the TRC. ROA 133-135. They also answered ready at the trial call on February 23, and the trial was confirmed to start the following Tuesday (as the court was then finishing another trial).
Each side filed a single motion in limine, and both were opposed. ROA 139-147. The court reviewed same over the ensuing weekend, and faxed tentative rulings to the parties on February 26. These were argued and ruled upon on February 27, following which the court heard opening statements and evidence began.
Ultimately, the court heard from 13 witnesses over 6 days (some more than once), and received around 800 exhibits into evidence (the majority by stipulation). Following phase 1 argument on March 7, 2018, the court took the case under submission.
After the parties jointly requested post-evidence briefing in lieu of closing argument, the court outlined for the parties a phased approach to the court's rendering of a decision, to include an initial tentative decision on four gateway issues, followed by further briefing, followed by a further tentative decision. The parties agreed to this approach. However, the defendants later evidently decided to a go in a different direction: they filed, on March 23, an objection to the initial tentative decision, ROA 175, which the court interprets as a request for SOD under CRC 3.1590(d), which in turn sets a clock in motion and creates another layer of work for the court. The court had, on March 9, published its tentative decision on the phase 1 issues in accordance with CCP section 632 and CRC 3.1590. It stated it would become the Statement of Decision (SOD) unless the steps required under CRC 3.1590(c) are taken within the timeframe set forth therein. The court assumes this is what the defendants were trying to accomplish with their March 23 filing (as the Rules of Court do not contemplate an objection to a tentative decision).
CCP section 632 provides:
"In superior courts, upon the trial of a question of fact by the court, written findings of fact and conclusions of law shall not be required. The court shall issue a statement of decision explaining the factual and legal basis for its decision as to each of the principal controverted issues at trial upon the request of any party appearing at the trial. . .
"[I]t is settled that the trial court need not, in a statement [of] decision, 'address all the legal and factual issues raised by the parties.' [Citation.] It 'is required only to set out ultimate findings rather than evidentiary ones.' [Citation.] "[U]ltimate fact[)""' is a slippery term, but in general it refers to a core fact. such as an element of claim or defense, without which the claim or defense must fail. [Citation.] It is distinguished conceptually from 'evidentiary facts' and 'conclusions of law.' [Citation.J" (Yield Dynamics, Inc. v. TEA Systems Corp. (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 547, 559.) "The trial court is not required to make an express finding of fact on every factual matter controverted at trial, where the statement of decision sufficiently disposes of all the basic issues in the case. (Bauer v. Bauer (1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1106, 1118.) A specific finding on a disputed factual issue is not required when that finding may necessarily be implied from a general finding. (St. Julian v. Financial Indemnity Co. (1969) 273 Cal.App.2d 185, 194.)
This is the court's [Proposed] SOD on phase 1 issues 1 in accordance with CRC 3.1590(f).

2. Applicable Standards.
A. Unlike the general ban on ex parte communications between litigants and judges, the law allows such communications between interested parties and members of the Commission under certain specified conditions. The California Coastal Act defines "ex parte communication" as an oral or written communication between a commissioner and an interested person about a matter within the Commission's jurisdiction that does not occur in a public hearing or other official proceeding or on the official record of the matter. Public Resources Code § 30322. The Act states that no commissioner "shall conduct an ex parte communication unless the commission member fully discloses and makes public the ex parte communication by providing a full report of the communication to the executive director within seven days after the communication or, if the communication occurs within seven days of the next commission hearing, to the commission on the record of the proceeding at that hearing." Public Resources Code § 30324(a).
Disclosure includes the "date, time and location of the communication," the "identity of the person or persons initiating and the person or persons receiving the communication," and a "complete description of the content of the communication." Public Resources Code § 30324(b)(1). "The executive director shall place in the public record any report of an ex parte communication." Public Resources Code § 30324(b)(2).
B. There are specified penalties for violations of the statutory ex parte communication requirements. Public Resources Code §§ 30327, 30824 (up to $7500 in civil fines for knowing violation of ex parte disclosure requirement.) In addition, "if a violation of this article occurs and a commission decision may have been affected by the violation, an aggrieved person, as described in Section 30801, may seek a writ of mandate from a court requiring the commission to revoke its action and rehear the matter." Public Resources Code § 30328. §
C. Where the question "is one of public right and the object of the mandamus is to procure the enforcement of a public duty, the [petitioner] need not show that he has any legal or special interest in the result, since it is sufficient that he is interested as a citizen in having the laws executed and the duty in question enforced.' (Bd. of Soc. Welfare v. County of L.A. (1945) 27 Cal.2d 98, 100-101. ... This "public right/public duty' exception to the requirement of beneficial interest for a writ of mandate" "promotes the policy of guaranteeing citizens the opportunity to ensure that no governmental body impairs or defeats the purpose of legislation establishing a public right." (Green v. Obledo, supra, 29 Cal.3d at pp. 145, 144 We refer to this variety of standing as "public interest standing." Save the Plastic Bag Coalition v. City of Manhattan Beach (2011) 52 Cal.4th 155, 166 (internal citations reduced). Courts consider the following factors in determining whether to allow public interest standing: whether the entity in question "has shown a continuing interest in or commitment to the public right being asserted; whether it represents individuals who would be beneficially interested in the action; whether individuals who are beneficially interested would find it difficult or impossible to seek vindication of their own rights; and whether prosecution of the action as a citizen suit by a corporation would conflict with other competing legislative policies. Save the Plastic Bag, supra, at 167. D. The exhaustion of administrative remedies is often a jurisdictional prerequisite to seeking judicial relief against governmental entities. Abelleira v. Dist. of Ct. of Appeal (1941) 17 Cal.2d 280, 292. The failure to exhaust is a jurisdictional defect. Coalition for Student Action v. City of Fullerton (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 1194, 1197. It is based upon the notion that a public agency must be given an opportunity to receive and respond to articulated factual issues and judicial review. ld. at 1198. legal theories before its actions are subjected to

Even claims of constitutional infirmities (McAllister v. County of Monterey (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 253, 276) and challenges to the validity of any governing regulation (Woods v. Super. Court (1981) 28 Cal.3d 668, 680) must be presented in the first instance to the administrative agency. This requirement permits the agency to apply its expertise, resolve factual issues, apply statutorily delegated remedies, and mitigate damages. Rojo v. Kliger (1990) 52 Cal.3d 65, 86.
However, the doctrine does not apply where no specific administrative remedies are available to the plaintiff. City of Coachella v. Riverside County Airport Land Use Comm. (1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 1277, 1287; see also Agnew v. State Bd. of Equalization (1999) 21 Cal.4th 310, 320.) "There must be 'clearly defined machinery' for the submission, evaluation and resolution of complaints by aggrieved parties." Jacobs v. State Bd. of Optometry (1978) 81 Cal.App.3d 1022, 1029.
E. "Generally speaking, four elements must be present in order to apply the doctrine of equitable estoppel: (1) the party to be estopped must be apprised of the facts; (2) he must intend that his conduct shall be acted upon, or must so act that the party asserting the estoppel had a right to believe it was SO intended; (3) the other party must be ignorant of the true state of facts; and (4) he must rely upon the conduct to his injury." Driscoll v. City of Los Angeles (1967) 67 Cal.2d 297, 305. "The doctrine of equitable estoppel may be applied against the government where justice and right require it." Id. at 306.
F. The parties reached, shortly before trial, a stipulation on certain "Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law." ROA 150. They reached a second such stipulation during trial, on March 1. ROA 154. They reached a third such stipulation on March 6. ROÀ 166. As juries are often instructed (CACI 106), stipulations of fact are binding and must be taken as true by the finder of fact. A stipulation is an agreement between opposing counsel that serves to obviate the need for proof or to narrow the range of litigable issues. (County of Sacramento V. Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd. (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1114, 1118.) As an agreement, a stipulation is subject to the ordinary rules employed to interpret contracts. (Sy First Family Ltd. Partnership v. Cheung (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 1334, 1341.) Accordingly, in construing a stipulation, the court's paramount consideration is the parties' objective intent at the time they entered into the stipulation. (lbid.) Parties may agree by stipulation to limit the issues presented to the trial court and the court will respect such stipulation. (Title Ins. Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization (1992) 4 Cal.4th 715, 733.) Matters that, by stipulation, are not before the court cannot be the basis for the court's ruling. (Assad V. Southern Pacific Transportation Co. (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 1609, 1616.) Stipulations are binding upon the parties. Palmer v. City of Long Beach, 33 Cal. 2d 134, 141-142 (1948). The court has already made the parties' stipulations the orders of the court, and to the extent not specifically addressed herein, incorporates same in this decision.
G. The 4th AC seeks declaratory relief. A threshold requirement for declaratory relief is the existence of a justiciable dispute. The declaratory judgment statute expressly provides that declaratory relief is available to parties to contracts or written instruments "in cases of actual controversy relating to the legal rights and duties of the respective parties." (Code Civ. Proc., § 1060, italics added.) Because Code of Civil Procedure section 1060 "makes the presence of an 'actual controversy' a jurisdictional requirement to the grant of declaratory relief ' " (Environmental Defense Project of Sierra County v. County of Sierra (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 877, 885 (Environmental Defense Project)), a "court is only empowered to declare and determine the rights and duties of the parties 'in cases of actual controversy' (Pittenger v. Home Savings & Loan Assn. (1958) 166 Cal.App.2d 32, 36 (Pittenger)). For this reason, the existence of an 'actual, present controversy " is 'fundamental' to an action for declaratory relief. (City of Cotati V. Cashman (2002) 29 Cal.4th 69, 79 (Cashman); In re Claudia E. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 627, 639.)
One requirement for a justiciable controversy is ripeness: there must be a dispute between adverse

parties on a specific set of facts that has reached the point that an invasion of one party's rights is likely unless the court orders relief and enters a conclusive judgment declaring the parties' rights and obligations. (See, e.g., Pacific Legal Foundation v. California Coastal Com. (1982) 33 Cal.3d 158. 170-171 (Pacific Legal Foundation); Selby Realty Co. v. City of San Buenaventura (1973) 10 Cal.3d 110, 117 (Selby Realty); County of San Diego v. State of California (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 8.
There is no basis for declaratory relief where only past wrongs are involved. Baldwin V. Marina City Properties, Inc. (1978) 79 Cal.App.3d 393, 407.
3. The Evidence.

The first witness was defendant Wendy Mitchell, called under Evid. Code section 776. Former Commissioner. Master's in Public Policy in 2003. Applied on line to Gov. Schwarzenegger to Coastal Commission. Impeached mildly with deposition. Agendas electronically, hard copies via mail, on line. Thought it was easier to read hard copy; asked to have them mailed toward the end of her six years. Understands the record include everything in staff files. Piles of papers delivered day of hearing. Not everything handed to her was on the website. Then temporized. Assumed staff was complying with the law. Never asked about this. Oversaw Exec. Director. Douglas, Ainsworth, Lester. Evaluated their performance. Never focused performance review on procedures regarding ex parte disclosures. Voted to terminate Lester in 2016. In 2015 she asked a question about ex partes. Did not focus on ex parte procedures in reviewing Lester.
Official record. Has read ex parte rules. Never seen an official file; never been to a district office. She assumed staff put disclosures in the official record but does not know where the disclosures went. Wanted to confirm the disclosures were being handled correctly and that iS why she raised it in 2015. Had concerns and counsel assured her. Did not ask where the official record is kept. Does not know what staff did with ex parte disclosure forms. Some she mailed, some electronic, some physically handed to staff. Did not keep copies of anything she submitted. Has not destroyed any records relating to ex parte disclosures.
Not sure when first heard "exhaustion of remedies." Impeached with depo on this. Not sure what it means. Had to do with suing the Commission. Does not understand the concept. Several questions on exhaustion. Agenda to public creates even playing field. Primary notification to public was via agenda website. Reasonable for members of the public to go to website. Agenda and backup. Did not use Commission website. Never trained on how public got information got agenda information. Relied on staff. Impeached with depo on public's reliance on website. So public and Commissioners on the same informational footing.
Her understanding of ex parte communication. Never changed. Read and understood ex parte rules. Impeached with deposition regarding her understanding of disqualification. Didn't investigate possibility of fines because always disclosed. Thought it was a $7500 max. Learned this in closed session. DNR trainings on ex parte rules. Understood timing requirements so everyone knew; "seven days prior to Commission meeting." Doesn't know how many days in advance agendas were posted.
Substance of disclosures required: anything substantive regarding the action item. Written materials had to be if disclosed if there were any. Doesn't know what happened to disclosures once turned over to staff. She understood that making the written disclosure to staff was her responsibility; not responsible for making sure public had it. But in 2015, wanted to confirm she was following the law. Understood purpose of ex parte rules was so everyone had the same info. Did not follow up her submission.

Ex. 363, pages 1221-1222. Does not* recall. Voted on a Carollo project. Self-reported to FPPC. Impeached with deposition on this (pp. 170-171). Read in the paper and then self-reported. Didn't see it before her depo. It was at the end of a packet. Only time this happened. Only client on whose project she voted.

relating to ex partes. Quite shocking - lack of a process. Not aware of lack of process.
Carollo did groundwater clean up. She provided services to that company for a couple of years. She was on retainer. She had other clients who also paid her, for comparable work. Derived no benefit from any ex parte communication. Agendas listed dates but items were postponed or trailed. Many communications were very rote; some people just read from the disclosure form. Same PowerPoint often shown again at meeting. Denies any secret meetings. Tried to make sure everyone had the same information. Never sought to conceal an ex parte. No one ever asked her to keep the ex parte communications secret. Ended for day not finished with this witness.
Friendly cross of Ms. Mitchell resumed at 9:07 a.m. of February 28. Recalis no instance in which material presented at ex parte was different than what was presented than what was presented in a Commission meeting.
Back and forth on what staff told her about the method of her disclosures. Very confused and imprecise on this. Did it only on the mic between from 2011 to 2014 or 2015. Not sure of when staff approached her. Denies other communications regarding "problems with ex parte disclosures." Later volunteered she could research this.

Staff postponed items. Ex. 302 likely prepared by "the advocate." Identical to disclosure form done by Brennan within Ex. 1248. Ex. 307 is another disclosure form. Ex. 530 contains another copy of Ex. 307. Distributed by staff as an addendum to staff report. Ex. 321/Ex. 551. Cox turned in an identical ex parte disclosure form to hers; Uranga's is different because he took a tour and she did not. Ex. 324 reflects a contact by opponents of a project. Ex. 508 is the staff report for the same project. Ex. 326. Ex. 358 - Ex. 503. Both relate to Kellog Avenue project.
Redirect at 10:00. DNR what work she did for Carollo in the month she voted. Different offices. Not Coastal Commission work. Beyond that DNR. Timing of PowerPoints. DNR regulations on ex parte communications. Often relied on lobbyist to prep the forms; handed to her after the meeting had concluded. Substantively identical forms not surprising to her. Ex. 324. Advocates did a good job summarizing because it was in their interest to do sO. Worked for Carollo every month she was on retainer. Compensation was in line with other clients and consultants.
Second witness at 10:17 was former Commissioner Martha McClure called under Evid. Code section 776. Retired teacher. Was also a Del Norte County Supervisor for 20 years. Received materials electronically via website, same way as public does so. Official Record is "all information the Commission contains within the file.' Enhanced by what occurs or is presented at the hearing. Exhaustion of remedies means cure and correct avenues. Impeached with deposition on this. Does not expect public to bring things to her attention if they are not known to the public. Her understanding of ex parte. One on one meeting without other side present. Received training on ex parte disclosure at public meetings twice. DNR when. Impeached with depo on whether she looked at whether Legislature changed the rules.
Knew seven day rule. Knew "on mic" rule. Needed to give date, the place, the people present, and the subject matter discussed. Also written materials had to be disclosed. Not required to duplicate written materials.

Gave all at the mic, personally delivered written ones to Vanessa. Occasionally by email; one by mail. May have faxed. Impeached with depo on this. Did not get receipts for submission until Oct. 2016, after

lawsuit was filed. Had heard expressions of concern about written disclosures not making it into official record. Did not evaluate Exec. Director on this.
Ms. McClure's testimony was interrupted for that of Frank P. Angel. Attorney since 1985. Environmental and public interest litigation. Described his work. Has done ex parte communications for clients. Malibu CDP matter for Keane. Had an ex parte on the phone with Sara Wan with Commissioner Howell. At least 15 minutes, maybe up to 35. Ex. 36. Lists the topics listed on Ex. 36 with Howell. Also discussed a couple of other items not reflected on Ex. 36. Broad Beach road heavily visited. Also discussed LCP systematic issue. Submitted PowerPoint at the subsequent hearing. Denies reading from a script. Had bullet points. Ex. 237. Ex parte disclosure form for McClure. By phone. Several of the ex partes - he brought up two other matters. Approximately half an hour. No PowerPoint by him; but Wan had one during ex parte. McClure asked questions buy DNR what questions. Also had ex parte with Mitchell 20-25 minutes. Ex. 134 Kinsey/by phone/25-30 minutes. Keane/Malibu. Were other things discussed beyond what is shown on this disclosure form. DNR if he asked questions. Also had a communication with Vargas. Had to be rescheduled. From his car. Discussed view protection.
Cross at 11:18: Can't recall with which commissioners he raised the two other issues that are not shown on any disclosures. Ex. 293. Aware of ex parte rules. He presented no written materials, although Wan did. Two non-defendant commissioners asked for a photo, which he later sent them. He put it in his PowerPoint. It is in the administrative record. This case was unusual for him. Nothing he wanted was confidential. Had 3 minutes at the hearing. Reason we had the ex parte was time limits at hearing. No limits on writings. Wan prepared Ex. 36 and 237.
The direct of Ms. McClure resumed at 11:40. Denies deleting any emails regarding ex parte communications. Ex. 202. Was Ex. E at her deposition. Impeached from her depo on this. Did not change her practice after this ruling in Sept. 2016. Staff did not file her paperwork. She left Commission in Dec. 2016. She did not follow up; this was staffs job. Found out staff was not doing their job in late 2016. Did not know this before July 2016. Knew she could not participate in any decision until ex parte communications are disclosed. Ex. 215, page 758-61. 8/4/16 memo. Pages 786-87. Pages 792-807 for notice. Minutes are Ex. 777.
Overnight at Schmidtz' house. Went to otball game after the Commission meeting. Commission would have paid for a hotel. He is a paid advocate with business before the Commission. Denies appearance of impropriety. Ex. 224 her signature. Does not know if was included in the website materials. Ex. 225. Her signature. May 7 was date of communication, and should have been disclosed earlier. Impeached with depo on this. Does not know if the exhibit booklet was supplied to staff. Did not verify. No received stamp obtained. Compare 224 and 225. Ex. 226: DNR if included in agenda materials. Only reason she thinks it was submitted is that Briggs got it in FOIA request. Also disclosed on mic.

If staff present, not an ex parte. Ex. 31 omits that Exec. Director was present. Ex. 33. A passing comment he made. Undated, but typically submitted same day. Ex. 38: Ex. 58 shows it was in the Staff Report. Same with Ex. 40 and 41/Éx. 515 (day before hearing addendum).

Impeached with deposition on this - unnecessarily combative witness. No decisions by full membership. No employees. No publications other than website. Uses Briggs' address. She believes ex parte communications should be banned entirely. She knows of no one checking to see if there were late disclosure forms on file. No one from Spotlight has ever testified before the Commission about ex parte communications. No one for Spotlight has ever written to the commission objecting to any disclosure or non-disclosure. Can't complain about an ex parte violation you don't know about. Assumed Commissioners were doing their jobs properly.

Stipulations reached, addressed to court.
Ex. 878, a video of a Commission Meeting, was shown to the court. It was an exemplar of seriatim "on the mic" disclosures.

Plaintiff's final witness was Al Wanger, 10th overall, a Commission staffer since 2000, called per Evid. Code section 776. PMK on agenda materials. Oversees webmaster. Webmaster uploads to agenda. No other involvement with ex parte disclosures. Worked with IT staff to set up new email box, and email account for each Commissioner. Email deletion policy - nothing in writing. Entire project file is not uploaded. Just staff reports and attachments. Ex. 811.
Friendly cross by Packard: Official record definition. A public records request response would be more inclusive than the staff report. Described process for uploading staff report. Deadline 10 days before hearing. Addenda: up to day of hearing. "On file" means Commissioner has submitted the form. May not be on line or in the addendum. "Prudent" to do it also "on mic."

football game.
The proceedings on March 6 ended with defendants seeking judicial notice of another trial court ruling (on the subject of "substantial compliance"). And the court hearing argument and ultimately denying the request for reasons stated in the court reporter's transcript.
On Wednesday, March 7, the penultimate witness called by defendants was Susan Hansch. She is chief deputy director of the Commission. Reimbursement for travel/hotel is overseen by her. If Friday meetings go long, or if the Commissioner has a long trip, state will cover Friday night. Told McClure that Commission would pay. Cross: Only decision points are end time of meeting and length of commute (i.e. to Crescent City). Southern California. Would depend on how the Commissioner wanted to travel home. Would pay for a hotel en route if they wanted to leave at noon. The Hansch testimony, which was consistent with defendant McClure's testimony on this point, was more credible than the Miller testimony on the subject of Friday night reimbursement.
Defendants' final witness was Rick Zbur. He is executive director of Equality California, since 2014. Former Latham & Watkins, LA office. Used to practice before Commission. Had ex parte communications - ten to 30 per year. Sometimes with consultants. Never secret. Almost always sharing info already in the public realm. Pointing out information already in record but perhaps not reviewed by Commissioner. Always wanted Commissioner to disclose fully so as to avoid a future action to set aside a project approval. Disclosure is beneficial. Applicant has an interest in full disclosure. Always provided written materials to staff. Interacted with Commission staff "pretty often." "My sense from the outside" was staff was undersized and hardworking. There were often delays in processing due to staff workload. Could not possibly include everything in the Commission files in the staff reports.
Interacted with all defendants except Howell. Thought Mitchell was diligent about disclosure. McClure also diligent. All commissioners were thorough. Same with Vargas and Kinsey.
Cross: why ex parte? Emphasize points already in record. Public hearings: very short opportunity to address Commission. Believed needed additional time. Looked at staff reports to see what opponents had said to Commissioners. One defendant (Vargas) is a member of his Board. Mr. Zbur's testimony was very credible and not seriously undermined on cross.
The court thereafter heard argument on the four threshold issues referenced at the end of section 1 above: standing, exhaustion, substantial compliance, and the statute of limitations.
4. Discussion and Rulings.

A. Some aspects of the case came down, as many cases do, to witness credibility. In making the credibility determinations set forth herein, the court considered, among others, the factors underlying CACI 107.

B. Standing. The testimony of Ms. Burton (which the court found credible), along with the court's review of the law summarized in part 2C above, convinces the court that plaintiff has standing to prosecute this action. First, defendants did not seriously challenge the plaintiff's capacity to sue or its adherence to the corporate formalities, all of which were established by the Burton testimony and the exhibits that came in while she was on the stand. Second, with respect to statutory standing, defendants conceded plaintiff is a "person" within the meaning of Public Resources Code section 30111 [which includes "corporation" and "organization" (which plaintiff clearly is) within the definition of "person."] Statutory standing is

conferred as to count 3 by sections 30111, 30805, and 30820(a)(2) taken together. Section* 30805 provides that "any person may maintain an action for the recovery of civil penalties provided in section 30820."

The issue of whether section 30820 applies at all in this case is one which affects several aspects of the matters presented for decision. Defendants contend, in essence, that because the Legislature created two special statutes relating to penalties for violation of the ex parte disclosure requirements (sections 30327 and 30824), the more general provision relating to penalties (section 30820) should not apply at all. Def. Tr. Br. at 13-14. If the defendants are correct, there is no statutory standing, and count three of the 4th AC must be dismissed in its entirety. But the court finds that the Legislature did not make sections 30327 and 30824 the exclusive means by which violations of the ex parte rules could be redressed.

Deciding whether section 30820 applies to this case involves an exercise in statutory interpretation. The general rules of statutory construction are (1) to ascertain the intent of the Legislature to effectuate the purpose of the law, (2) to give a provision a reasonable and commonsense interpretation consistent with its apparent purpose, which will result in wise policy rather than mischief or absurdity, (3) to give significance, if possible, to every word or part, and harmonize the parts by considering a particular section in the context of the whole, (4) to take matters such as content, object, evils to be remedied. legislation on the same subject, public policy, and contemporaneous construction into account, and (5) to give great weight to consistent administrative construction. (DeYoung v. City of San Diego (1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 11, 17-18 [194 Cal.Rptr. 722].) As the court noted in Mt. Hawley Ins. Co. v. Lopez, 215 Cal. App. 4th 1385, 1396-98 (2013), courts interpreting statutory schemes "begin with the fundamental rule that our primary task is to determine the lawmakers' intent." (Delaney v. Superior Court (1990) 50 Cal.3d 785, 798.) "In construing statutes, we aim 'to ascertain the intent of the enacting legislative body SO that we may adopt the construction that best effectuates the purpose of the law.' (Klein v. United States of America (2010) 50 Cal.4th 68, 77, quoting Hassan v. Mercy American River Hospital (2003) 31 Cal.4th 709, 715.)
California courts "have established a process of statutory interpretation to determine legislative intent that may involve up to three steps." (Alejo v. Torlakson (2013) 212 Cal.App.4th 768, 786-787.) The "key to statutory interpretation is applying the rules of statutory construction in their proper sequence ... as follows: 'we first look to the plain meaning of the statutory language, then to its legislative history and finally to the reasonableness of a proposed construction.' " (Macísaac v. Waste Management Collection & Recycling, Inc. (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1076, 1082, quoting Riverview Fire Protection Dist. v. Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd. (1994) 23 Cal.Äpp.4th 1120, 1126, 28 Cal.Rptr.2d 601.)
"The first step in the interpretive process looks to the words of the statute themselves." (Alejo, supra, 212 Cal.App.4th at p. 787; see Klein, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 77, 112 ["[w]e look first to the words of the statute, "because the statutory language is generally the most reliable indicator of legislative intent' "].) "If the interpretive question is not resolved in the first step, we proceed to the second step of the inquiry. [Citation.] In this step, courts may 'turn to secondary rules of interpretation, such as maxims of construction, "which serve as aids in the sense that they express familiar insights about conventional language usage." ' We may also look to the legislative history. [Citation.] 'Both the legislative history of the statute and the wider historical circumstances of its enactment may be considered in ascertaining the legislative intent.' [Citation.] [1l 'If ambiguity remains after resort to secondary rules of construction and to the statute's legislative history, then we must cautiously take the third and final step in the interpretive process. [Citation.] In this phase of the process, we apply "reason, practicality, and common sense to the language at hand." [Citation.] Where an uncertainty exists, we must consider the consequences that will

DEPT: Exhibit A - Page 54 Calendar No.

CASE TITLE: Spotlight On Coastal Corruption vs Kinsey CASE NO: 37-2016-00028494-CU-MC-CTL [IMAGED]
flow from a particular interpretation. [Citation.] Thus, "[i]n determining what the Legislature intended we are bound to consider not only the words used, but also other matters, 'such as context, the object in view, the evils to be remedied, the history of the times and of legislation upon the same subject, public policy and contemporaneous construction.' [Citations.]" These "other matters" can serve as important guides, because our search for the statute's meaning is not merely an abstract exercise in semantics. To the contrary, courts seek to ascertain the intent of the Legislature for a reason-"to effectuate the purpose of the law. (Alejo, at pp. 787-788; see Maclsaac, supra, 134 Cal.App.4th at p. 1084.)
Courts do not necessarily engage in all three steps of the analysis. "It is only when the meaning of the words is not clear that courts are required to take a second step and refer to the legislative history.' (Soil v. Superior Court (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 872, 875; accord, Sisemore v. Master Financial, Inc. (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1386, 1411; see Maclsaac, supra, 134 Cal.App.4th at 1084 l"[i]f ambiguity remains after resort to secondary rules of construction and to the statute's legislative history, then we must cautiously take the third and final step in the interpretative process".)
Applying these precepts, the court first notes that while it is true that the Commission's prior construction of section 30820 as applying • only to violations in the nature of development or un- permitted construction or elimination of protected wetlands is entitled to some deference, this assumption is entitled to less weight where, as here, the confluence of sections 30820, 30327 and 30824 is being considered for the first time. Nor is the court persuaded by the "parade of horribles" argued by defendants as reflecting absurdity if plaintiffs construction is adopted. Def. Tr. Br. at 17. The other hypothetical "violations" of the Coastal Act are not before this court. What is before this court is a simple question: does "any violation of this division" include violation of the ex parte rules. The court answers this question in the affirmative based on a plain reading of the unambiguous word "any." Further informing this view are two observations about the statutory scheme: first, if the Legislature had intended section 30820 to cover only "development" related violations, subpart (2) of section 30820(a) would have been largely unnecessary. Second, the language contained in both section 30327 and 30824 "in addition to any other applicable penalty" would be rendered a nullity if defendants' construction is correct. Courts must harmonize statutory schemes, not eliminate legislative language. Accordingly, the court holds that section 30820 reaches the conduct at issue in this case, and therefore statutory standing is conferred as to count 3. Defendants' attention turned, in the March 23 filing (ROA 175), to the legislative history of section 30820. See ROA 176-186. Defendants had really not developed this argument previously. But consistent with the case law summarized above, the court finds the words of the statute clear and finds that it need not resort to a review of the legislative history. Turning to public interest standing, defendants erroneously argue that the 4th AC in this case "does not please (sic should read "plead") mandamus." Def. Tr. Br. at 19:21. This, of course, is incorrect. Paragraph 6 of the prayer in the 4th AC does seek a writ of mandate. So the initial central premise of defendants' public interest standing argument collapses.
Moreover, defendants acknowledge that public interest standing can be conferred by exercise of discretion. Def. Tr. Br. at 20:6-8. The court finds that circumstances for the exercise of this discretion exist, inasmuch as failing to allow standing as to counts one and two would result in the lack of an effective remedy for violation of an important public interest statute. Defendants concede there has never been a prior case alleging violation of the Commission's ex parte rules, and the court believes the evidence shows this is in part because of the inattention of the Commission staff to this issue prior to August of 2016. [See, e. g. McClure testimony late in the morning of Feb. 28 about the staff "not doing its job." If the Commission was inattentive to the process of making sure disclosures were made part of the public record in advance of hearings, and the AG's office is defending the conduct, the only way to

DATE: 03/28/2018 MINUTE ORDER Page 20 DEPT: Exhibit A - Page 55 Calendar No.

CASE TITLE: Spotlight On Coastal Corruption vs Kinsey CASE NO: 37-2016-00028494-CU-MC-CTL [IMAGED]
facilitate the effective pursuit of a remedy is to confer public interest standing. The court further finds that conferring standing would be entirely consistent with Plastic Bag, supra, 52 Cal. 4th at 166.
The court finds the federal authority cited in ROA 172 by defendants for the absence of public interest standing and associational standing [Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432 US 333 (1977), and Washington Legal Foundation v. Leavitt, 477 F. Supp.2d 202 (DDC 2007)], to be not binding on this court (as to the latter case), enSclesS Bonu s en c  e aala pure issues of state law than Plastic Bag, supra, and Taxpayers for Accountable School (2013). 4th 1013, 1031

For these reasons, the court agrees with plaintiff that it has standing to pursue this case: public interest standing exists as to counts one and two, and statutory standing exists as to count three.
C. Exhaustion. As an initial matter, the court agrees with plaintiff that exhaustion does not apply where, as here, the plaintiff/petitioner is not seeking to overturn an action of the Commission. The Legislature knows how to differentiate between the term "person" and "aggrieved person," and so did several of the witnesses in this trial. Section 30328 allows an aggrieved person, as described in Section 30801, to seek writ of mandate from court requiring the commission to revoke its action and rehear the matter "if a violation of this article occurs and a commission decision may have been affected by the violation." But as developed above, section 30820 provides an additional vehicle for redress that does not involve setting aside prior Commission orders or development approvals. While exhaustion would clearly apply to actions under 30328, exhaustion does not apply to actions under 30820.
Further, the court finds defendants' exhaustion argument fundamentally inconsistent with their argument concerning when a disclosure of an ex parte communication is made part of the record. Def. Tr. Br. at 12. Defendants contend that if a Commissioner has written a disclosure which is then buried somewhere in the bureaucracy the Coastal Commission, members of the public must find it and object at the hearing so the matter under consideration can be delayed.** (Def. Tr. Br. at 11:25) Charitably put, this argument is inconsistent with the principles underlying the Coastal Act generally, and the ex parte rules specifically. How can a concerned party, desiring to participate in the transparent public process that is supposed to accompany the Commission's stewardship of the Coastal Zone, be expected to raise non-compliance with the ex parte rules if it is impossible as a practical matter for the concerned party to know of such violations? Defendants, in the March stipulation, acknowledged that some of the five Commissioners' written ex parte disclosures were not in the agenda materials provided to the public via the Commission's website in advance of the applicable hearing. All five defendants acknowledged they would not expect members of the public to object to ex parte disclosures they could not have been aware of. According to the testimony of Mr. Staben, the delay in including written disclosures in agenda materials was due to the Commission's staff being backlogged up to a month in processing the disclosures. This was an institutional failure which, in the court's view, defeats the exhaustion defense. The failure to exhaust defense was not made out by defendant such that it is entitled to a judgment of dismissal. The PAGA case and the prisoner case relied upon by defendants in ROA 172 [Dunlap v. Superior Court (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 330; Wright v. State of Calif. (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 659] are easily distinguishable on chasmally different facts.
Moreover, even if the doctrine does apply, it is not a bar where no specific administrative remedies are available to the plaintiff. City of Coachella v. Riverside County Airport Land Use Comm. (1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 1277, 1287; see also Agnew v. State Bd. of Equalization (1999) 21 Cal.4th 310, 320.) "There must be 'clearly defined machinery' for the submission, evaluation and resolution of complaints by aggrieved parties." Jacobs v. State Bd. of Optometry (1978) 81 Cal.App.3d 1022, 1029. Here, even after

DEPT: Exhibit A - Page 56 Calendar No.

CASE TITLE: Spotlight On Coastal Corruption vs Kinsey [IMAGED] CASE NO: 37-2016-00028494-CU-MC-CTL
the Commission revamped its procedures for handling ex parte disclosure forms in August of 2016 (Ex. 215:786), it did not create a rule or process giving an interested party an absolute right or other clearly defined machinery to seek or receive a hearing continuance if he or she or it heard an "on the mic" disclosure that was tardily made or otherwise infirm.
D. Substantial Compliance. In determining whether a state body has substantially complied with statutory requirements "[tlhe paramount consideration is the objective of the statute." (Downtown Palo Alto Com. For Fair Assessment v. City Council (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 384, 395, 225 Cal.Rptr. 559.) "Unless the intent of a statute can only be served by demanding strict compliance with its terms, substantial compliance is the governing test." (County of Tulare v. Campbell (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 847, 853, 57 Cal.Rptr.2d 902.) " "Substantial compliance means actual compliance in respect to the substance essential to every reasonable objective of the statute.' (Stasher Harger-Haldeman (1962) 58 Cal.2d 23, 29 [22 Cal.Rptr. 657, 372 P.2d 649], italics omitted.)" (National Parks & Conservation Assn. v. County of Riverside (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 1505, 1522, 50 Cal.Rptr.2d 339.)
In N. Pacifica LLC v. California Coastal Comm'n, 166 Cal. App. 4th 1416, 1431-32 (2008), the court held: "The stated objectives of the Bagley-Keene Act are to assure that "actions of state agencies be taken openly and that their deliberation be conducted openly." (Gov.Code, § 11120.) Because Government Code section 11130.3, subdivision (b)(3) allows substantial compliance with the Bagley-Keene Act's notice requirements, the objectives of that Act can be served without demanding strict compliance with those requirements. Thus, state actions in violation of those requirements should not be nullified, so long as the state agency's reasonably effective efforts to notify interested persons of a public meeting serve the statutory objectives of ensuring that state actions taken and deliberations made at such meetings are open to the public."
In Sims V. Dep't of Corrections, 216 Cal. App. 4th 1059, 1073 (2013), the court noted that "substantial compliance, an affirmative proposition, is the counterpart, or obverse, of the substantial failure to comply, which negatively expresses the same idea. ... it is therefore proper to say that noncompliance is insubstantial, or "harmless," only where it does not compromise any "reasonable objective" of" statute being examined.
The court holds that defendants are not entitled to an across-the-board finding of substantial compliance thereby mandating a judgment of dismissal. As plaintiff pointed out, the Legislature knows how to employ the words "substantial compliance," doing so several times in various provisions of the Public Resources Code (e.g. sections 41813, 48662, 49501.3, 21092). It did not include these words in the statutes relating to ex parte disclosure requirements. More fundamentally, the court agrees with plaintiff that the desire for openness and transparency, expressed throughout the Coastal Act and in particular in the ex parte rules, has intrinsic value in and of itself and indeed is a reasonable objective, standing alone, of the Coastal Act. The evidence in this case does not lead to a wholesale conclusion that the ex parte rules have been substantially complied with; such a general finding would compromise a reasonable objective of the statutory scheme. This does not mean, of course, that the court might find individual derelictions SO minor or inconsequential that the maxim "de minimis non curat lex" might apply. This, however, requires a further examination of individual disclosures, which is beyond the scope of this phase of the court's decision. For now, all that can be said is that plaintiff has carried its burden to show that defendants are not entitled to judgment via application of the doctrine of substantial compliance. E. Limitations. Several witnesses testified they could not recall the substance of ex parte communications from 2013-2015, and several testified they could not recall the substance of ex parte disclosures they made 'on the mic" from that timeframe. The statutes of limitation exist in part because of the foibles of memory. "There are several policies underlying such statutes. One purpose is to give

DATE: 03/28/2018 MINUTE ORDER Page 22 DEPT: Exhibit A - Page 57 Calendar No.

CASE TITLE: Spotlight On Coastal Corruption vs Kinsey CASE NO: 37-2016-00028494-CU-MC-CTL [IMAGED]
defendants reasonable repose, thereby protecting parties from 'defending stale claims, where factual obscurity through the loss of time, memory or supporting documentation may present unfair handicaps.' A statute of limitations also stimulates plaintiffs to pursue their claims diligently." Fox v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc., 35 Cal. 4th 797 (2005)(internal citations omitted). The court finds that the one-year statute of CCP section 340(a) for actions seeking civil penalties applies to counts one and two. Although section 340(a) contains an exception "if the statute imposing it (the penalty) prescribes a different limitation," neither, section 30327 nor 30824 does so. Although mandamus and declaratory relief is sought in the 4th AC, the gist or gravamen of the action is one for civil penalties. Accordingly, the statute of limitations for counts one and two is CCP section 340(a) (one year). in what is apparently another issue of first impression, the court holds that the so-called "discovery rule" does not apply to section 340(a). The only case cited by plaintiff holding that the discovery rule delays accrual of a claim arose under section 340(c) in a defamation context. Shively v. Bozanich, 31 Cal. 4th 1230, 1253 (2003). Actions for penalties or forfeitures are a different animal than actions for libel or slander, particularly when leveled against public officials such as commissioners. Further, when the Legislature intends for the discovery rule or other delayed accrual concept to apply, it explicitly says so. See, e.g. CCP sections 337.1(b); 337.15(g); 337.2; 338(b)(C); 338(d); 338(h); 338(i); 338.1; 340.1; 340.15(a)(2); 340.2(a)(2); 340.35; 340.5; 340.6; 340.7; 340.8. Even if the discovery rule did apply, the one year statute would bar any claims contained in counts 1 and 2 arising from "on the mic" disclosures, because all information necessary to challenge the disclosure was available at the hearing. Finally, plaintiff did not carry its burden to establish that defendants are estopped to raise the statute of limitations.
With regard to the claims asserted in count 3, the applicable statute is the three-year statute of Public Resources Code section 30805.5. This is another logical result of the court's holding, in part 4B above, that section 30820 reaches the conduct challenged in this action. That said, the court will expect plaintiff to adhere to the representation made in footnote 5 of its trial brief. Defendants were entitled to rely on that concession in preparing to try the case. In light of the foregoing, and in light of the filing date of the complaint (August 17, 2016), count three reaches conduct after August 17, 2013, and counts 2 and 3 reach back only to August 17, 2015. Having addressed the threshold issues, the court now turns to the five counts alleged in the 4th amended complaint. F. Count 1: violation of Section 30324 - failure to fully disclose ex parte communications by providing a full report of the communication to the executive director within seven days after the communication or, if the communication occurs within seven days of the next commission hearing, to the Commission on the record of the proceeding at that hearing.
Section 30824 provides:
"In addition to any other applicable penalty, any commission member who knowingly violates Section 30324 is subject to a civil fine, not to exceed seven thousand five hundred dollars ($7,500). Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the court may award attorneys' fees and costs to the prevailing party." No published decision has considered these provisions as of this writing.
Before addressing the claims against each of the five defendants, the court makes some overall observations about what the evidence has shown in this case.
It is abundantly clear to the court that the Legislature needs to consider the current and future viability of the Commission as it is presently constituted. Specifically, the court sincerely questions whether the

DATE: 03/28/2018 MINUTE ORDER Page 23
DEPT: Exhibit A - Page 58 Calendar No.

CASE TITLE: Spotlight On Coastal Corruption vs Kinsey CASE NO: 37-2016-00028494-CU-MC-CTL [IMAGED]
mandates of the Coastal Act - the protection of natural resources with due respect for property rights can be efficiently carried out with transparency and participatory openness using a part-time, unpaid volunteer board that meets only 3 days a month at scattered locations. The testimony was overwhelming that Commissioners try to jam the important work of the Commission into their already full schedules as teachers (McClure), local government officials (McClure, Kinsey and Howell), consultants (Mitchell), single mothers (Mitchell), investors (Vargas), attorneys (Howell), etc. They receive only travel expenses, receive minimal if any dedicated staff support, and are provided with no office or dedicated computer or other "back office" or tech support. They only recently got Commission email addresses. They are presented a few days before hearings with literally thousands of pages of dense documents which they must access on the Commission's website, read and consider. These staff reports and addenda are often supplemented at or shortly before the hearings with hundreds of pages of additional material jammed under their hotel room doors the night before a hearing or stacked on the dais at the hearing. Some defendants were candid in acknowledging they cannot read every page; others claimed they did, but given the volume described, the court observes that this must have been, at most. a cursory review. The court, having read numerous administrative records in its career, suggests that anyone who thinks that all Commissioners are actually studying all of the voluminous materials presented is simply fooling herself/himself. This problem is exacerbated by the clear testimony that Commission meetings often last 12-16 hours per day. There are 5.5 hours per day of testimony/evidence in an average Superior Court trial, and jurors (and even judges) sometimes have a hard time attending for even this period of time. Woe is the lot of applicants or opponents in Coastal Commission hearings when they fall in the second half of a 12-16 hour agenda. This is not justice.
The courts cannot hope to function as the guardians of parties' substantive and due process rights and efficiently serve as the forum for dispute resolution in a free and open society unless they are adequately funded by the other branches of government. Similarly, the Coastal Commission cannot pretend to be the quasi-judicial forum for resolution of disputes over coastal protection and coastal development unless the other branches both properly fund the Commission's mission and provide a pre-hearing and hearing structure that IS equal to the increasingly daunting task.*** The evidence in this case is strongly suggestive of a need for legislative attention to the latter (which could very well result in a need for enhancements to the former). Mr. Zbur's testimony, in particular, supported the court's conclusions in this regard.
Beyond the impositions on the individual Commissioners,**** as well as on the applicants for Commission approval and opponents in those matters, the current practice also places undue power and control in the hands of Commission staff - who are neither elected by the People nor appointed by anyone elected by the People. Because Commissioners cannot reasonably be expected to read and consider all of the detailed materials they are presented with every month, the "staff recommendation" no doubt takes on an outsized role. This in turn exacerbates the problems critics of ex parte communications have identified, and undoubtedly affects the Commissioner independence which the drafters of the Coastal Act were seeking to achieve.
It is equally clear to the court that prior to August of 2016, the Commission had essentially no process for tracking the processing of written disclosure forms, and either no process or at best an inadequate process for insuring that Commissioners were trained in, understood, and complied with their disclosure obligations. The 2014 training does not appear to the court to have been sufficient, and from all that appears was not the subject of any follow-up or refresher (despite Commissioner turnover). Staff support was inadequate, leading to delays of up to a month in processing written disclosures (which in many cases completely defeated the purpose of disclosure). Much of what plaintiff established were the institutional failures of a non-party (the Commission), not personal failures of individual Commissioners.

DEPT: Exhibit A - Page 59 Calendar No.

CASE TITLE: Spotlight On Coastal Corruption vs Kinsey CASE NO: 37-2016-00028494-CU-MC-CTL [IMAGED]

Since August of 2016, the process has gotten much better. See Exhibit 215:786-87. Commissioners now have a single preferred method of submission of written disclosures (email to a single email address), and a single "clearing house" for written disclosures. The Commission staff now has procedures and time deadlines for receipt, time stamping, file maintenance, and the provision of written disclosure to district offices (so the disclosure may be made part of the agenda materials for individual items under consideration by the Commission and thereby become available for public scrutiny).
The court finds, however, that the post-August 2016 process still has room for improvement. For example, the written disclosure form should include a requirement that the Commissioner state the duration of the ex parte phone call or meeting (as doing so will help the public understand if the essence of the communication has been fairly rendered in the text). And the Commission should clarify and enforce the requirement that written materials shown or handed to a Commissioner during an ex parte communication be attached to written disclosure forms. It is not enough, in the court's view, to rely on what has apparently been a longstanding assumption: that consultants or proponents or opponents will supply identical sets of briefing materials to some unidentified staff person, and that is enough. It is not enough. The public has a right to know exactly what PowerPoint or other briefing material was shown to a particular Commissioner on a particular day at a particular ex parte communication. PowerPoints can be changed with a few mouse clicks. "Evolution" of presentation materials is not hard to imagine. Again, these are institutional failures of the Commission, not the individual Commissioners. And this is not just the court's view. It is also the Legislature's mandate. Section 30324(b) requires disclosure of "the complete text of any written material that was part of the communication." It says nothing about these materials being "submitted to staff." And it is crystal clear the defendants knew this: they were trained on this specific provision. See Ex. 215, pages 786 and 803. But they were also told, as was the public, that submission to the staff was enough. Ex. 215, page 761. This was an another institutional failure in the court's view.
The court finds, with regard to written disclosures that were complete and timely submitted by defendants to Commission staff but not processed in a timely fashion, that plaintiff failed to carry its burden of proof as to willful non-disclosure. The statutory scheme contemplates how an individual Commissioner "discloses and makes public" the ex parte communication: "by providing a full report of the communication to the executive director within seven days after the communication." There is no additional requirement that individual Commissioners ensure that Commission staff processes the disclosure seasonably. Rather, the "executive director shall place in the public record any report of an ex parte communication." Public Resources Code § 30324(b)(2). Plainly, before August of 2016, the executive director had failed to arrange the staff that reported to him in such a manner SO as to carry out this requirement.
Further, the court credits the testimony of the defendants who testified their normal practice was to submit written disclosures within a day of the date they were signed. There was no evidence that the standard of care prior to August, 2016 was to obtain and receive some documentary evidence of the time and date of submission (such as a "conformed copy" or receipt of some sort. In this regard, too, plaintiff failed to carry its burden of proof. The court expects that this will eliminate a significant number of the alleged derelictions under sections 30327 and 30824.
Having made these observations, the court now turns to determining whether, in addition to the institutional failures past and present, there were individual failings proven by plaintiff.

occasions, giving rise to $525,000.00 in civil penalties ($7500 per violation per section 30824).
2. Commissioner Howell. Plaintiff contends Howell violated section 30324 on at least 48 occasions, giving rise to $360,000.00 in civil penalties ($7500 per violation per section 30824).
3. Former Commissioner McClure. Plaintiff contends McClure violated section 30324 on at least 42 occasions, giving rise to $315,000.00 in civil penalties ($7500 per violation per section 30824).
4. Former Commissioner Mitchell. Plaintiff contends Mitchell violated section 30324 on at least 60 occasions, giving rise to $450,000.00 in civil penalties ($7500 per violation per section 30824).
5. Commissioner Vargas. Plaintiff contends Vargas violated section 30324 on at least 75 occasions, giving rise to $562,500.00 in civil penalties ($7500 per violation per section 30824).

G. Count 2: violation of section 30327 - knowingly making, participating in making, or in some other way attempting to use his or her official position as a member of the Commission to influence a Commission decision having failed to disclose an ex parte communication as required by Section 30324.
Section 30327 provides:
"a) No commission member or alternate shall make, participate in making, or any other way attempt to use his or her official position to influence a commission decision about which the member or alternate has knowingly had an ex parte communication that has not been reported pursuant to Section 30324.
(b) In addition to any other applicable penalty, including a civil fine imposed pursuant to Section 30824, a commission member who knowingly violates this section shall be subject to civil fine, not to exceed seven thousand five hundred dollars ($7,500). Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the court may award attorneys' fees and costs to the prevailing party.'
Again, as of this writing, no published decision has shed light on these provisions.
1 . Former Commissioner Kinsey. Plaintiff contends Kinsey is liable for an additional 70 violations.
2. Commissioner Howell. Plaintiff contends Howell is liable for an additional 48 violations.

3. Former Commissioner McClure. Plaintiff contends McClure is liable for an additional 42 violations.
4. Former Commissioner Mitchell. Plaintiff contends Mitchell is liable for an additional 60 violations.
5. Commissioner Vargas. Plaintiff contends Vargas is liable for an additional 75 violations.
H. Count 3: Alleges violations of sections 30324 and 30327 are "separately punishable" under section 30820, subject to a cap of $30,000 per violation. Defendants are not entitled to wholesale dismissal of count 3; this is another logical result of the court's holding in part 4B above, that section 30820 reaches

the conduct challenged in this action. Section 30820(c) sets forth a list of factors the court must consider in determining the amount of the penalty: (1) The nature, circumstance, extent, and gravity of the violation. (2) Whether the violation is susceptible to restoration or other remedial measures. 1nT The sensitivity of the resource affected by the violation (not applicable here) The cost to the state of bringing the action (not applicable here). (5) With respect to the violator, any voluntary restoration or remedial measures undertaken, any prior history of violations, the degree of culpability, economic profits, if any, resulting from, or expected to result as a consequence of, the violation, and such other matters as justice may require.
1. Former Commissioner Kinsey. Plaintiff contends Kinsey is liable for $4.2 million (140 violations x $30,000.00).
2. Commissioner Howell. Plaintiff contends Howell is liable for $2.88 million.
3. Former Commissioner McClure. Plaintiff contends McClure is liable for $2.52 million.
4. Former Commissioner Mitchell. Plaintiff contends Mitchell is liable for $3.6 million.
5. Commissioner Vargas. Plaintiff contends Vargas is liable for $4.5 million.
l. Count 4: violation of section 30327.5 Prohibition of gifts - McClure/Schmitz. The court finds plaintiff did not carry its burden of proof to establish count 4 by a preponderance of the evidence, and it is dismissed. Former Commissioner McClure is the prevailing party on count 4. Plaintiff is entitled to no relief on count 4.

Cal. Pub. Res. Code § 30327.5 provides:
a) An interested person shall not give, convey, or make available gifts aggregating more than ten dollars a ($10) in a calendar month to a commissioner or a member of the commission's staff. (b) A commissioner or member of the commission's staff shall not dollars ($10) in a calendar month from an interested person. accept gifts aggregating more than ten
(c) For purposes of this section, "interested person" shall have the same meaning as the term is defined in Section 30323. (d) For purposes of this section, "gift" means, except as provided in subdivision (e), a payment, as defined in Section 82044 of the Government Code, that confers a personal benefit on the recipient, to the extent that consideration of equal or greater value is not received and includes a rebate or discount in the price of anything of value unless the rebate or discount is made in the regular course of business to members of the public without regard to official status. A person, other than a defendant in a criminal action, who claims that a payment is not a gift by reason of receipt of consideration has the burden of proving that the consideration received is of equal or greater value. (e) For purposes of this section, "gift" does not include any of the following: (1) A gift that is not used and that, within 30 days after receipt, is either returned to the donor or delivered to a nonprofit entity exempt from taxation under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, without being claimed as a charitable contribution for tax purposes. (2) A gift from an individual's spouse, child, parent, grandparent, grandchild, brother, sister, parent-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, nephew, niece, aunt, uncle, or first cousin, or the spouse of one of those individuals. However, a gift from one of those people shall be considered a gift if the donor

is acting as an agent or intermediary for a person not covered in this paragraph. (3) A cost associated with the provision of evidentiary material provided to the commission and its staff. (4) An educational or training activity that has received prior approval from the commission. (5) A field trip or site inspection that is made available on equal terms and conditions to all commissioners and appropriate staff. (6) A reception or purely social event that is not offered in connection with or is not intended to influence a decision or action of the commission and that is open to all commissioners, members of the staff, and members of the public and press.
Under section 30327.6, a person who violates this prohibition is subject to a $500.00 fine.
Added in 2007 and amended in 2008, these provisions have apparently never before been addressed by a court. As already noted in part 3 above, The Hansch testimony, which was consistent with defendant McClure's testimony on this point, was more credible than the Miller testimony on the subject of Friday night reimbursement. Ms. McClure was entitled to stay in Southern California at public expense after a late-ending Commission meeting. It was not feasible for her to attempt same-night travel to Crescent City (which might as a well be in Oregon and has only a part-time airport at best). Her lodging would have cost her nothing, and would have cost the taxpayers something. Her stay at Mr. Schmidtz' house cost her nothing. The end result: she received nothing of value, and the State saved whatever the government rate was at the hotel for the one night in question.
It is important to note that sections 30327.5 and 30327.6 are not bans on conduct involving an appearance of impropriety. If they were, the outcome might be different. The court can certainly understand that eyebrows were raised by Ms. McClure's decision to stay at the home a of a paid advocate who had appeared before the Commission. On the other hand, while Schmidtz was an "interested person," plaintiff did not establish that Mr. Schmidtz had appeared before the Commission at the meeting which had just ended, or that he was representing a client with then-pending business before the Commission. Nor did plaintiff prove that Schmidtz paid for McClure's admittance to the high school football game, or that the cost of admission exceeded $10.00.
J. Count 5: violation of section 30327.5 - Prohibition of gifts - Mitchell/Carollo. The court finds plaintiff did not carry its burden of proof to establish count 5 by a preponderance of the evidence, and it is dismissed. Former Commissioner Mitchell is the relief on count 5. prevailing party on count 5. Plaintiff is entitled to no

The evidence preponderated in favor of a finding that Mitchell did work for another office of Carollo than the one that did business before the Commission. The evidence preponderated in favor of a finding that Carollo was a subcontractor to another entity that had worked on a matter that came before Mitchell and the other Commissioners, making it hard for her to discern its involvement. Finally, the evidence preponderated in favor of a finding that the $5000 monthly retainer paid by Carollo to Mitchell for consulting work before bodies other than the Commission was a normal retainer, paid in exchange for services she rendered to that company. Thus, consideration of equal or greater value was received, and the retainer was not a gift within the meaning of section 30327.5(d).

The clerk is ordered forthwith to provide copies of this tentative decision to counsel for both sides. Mr. must forthwith present the court with a form of judgment consistent with the foregoing.
March 2018

IT IS SO ORDERED.

Undesignated references herein to "section" are to the Public Resources Code unless the context clearly requires otherwise. **This apparent preference for delaying the public's business so that untimely disclosures can somehow be rendered harmless by the passage of additional time is probably not surprising in an entity already frequently criticized for the glacial pace of its proceedings. See McAllister v. Cty. of Monterey, 147 Cal. App. 4th 253, 274 (2007)(interpreting statutory "short time limit" as 'designed to avoid unnecessary bureaucratic delay'); LT-WR, L.L.C. v. California Coastal Comm'n, 151 Cal. App. 4th 427, 789 (2007)(holding petitioner "was not without a remedy in the face of the Commission's delay in hearing the matter); Healing v. California Coastal Com., 22 Cal. App. 4th 1158, 1171 (1994)("We summarily reject the Coastal Commission's contention that the delay Healing has suffered (and is continuing to suffer) is "normal.") The Fourth District Court of Appeal, Div. 1, arguably allowed the Commission to impose such bureaucratic delay in Coronado Yacht Club v. California Coastal Com., 13 Cal. App. 4th 860, 871 (1993). ***The court says "increasingly daunting" a for a reason. California's population continues to grow, albeit perhaps at a slower rate than in years past. There is less and less undeveloped land in the Coastal Zone. Scientists tell us that ocean levels are rising. It is hard to imagine that there will be fewer conflicts between development and preservation coming before the Commission in future years, and it is not a stretch to imagine that those conflicts will be increasingly complex. ****One wonders why anyone not independently wealthy would apply for appointment to the Commission as currently constituted, knowing in advance what is expected and how little support is offered.

CITY OF LAGUNA BEACH

LAND USE ELEMENT

Adopted by the City Council
February 7, 2012
Ordinance No.1559

Exhibit D Page 76

MISSION STATEMENT
To ensure that the City of Laguna Beach will endure for future generations as a thriving, sustainable community that respects and nurtures our scenic natural surroundings, village character, and quality of life.

GUIDING PRINCIPLES
The following guiding principles provide the basis for detailed policies included in the General Plan elements.

1. Strengthen our sense of community The General Plan envisions Laguna Beach as a place of abundant scenic natural beauty, small-town village charm, and cultural diversity. Laguna residents take great pride in their community, which has a tradition of promoting the arts, historic preservation, and participation in civic and community organizations. The community is made up of quiet, close-knit neighborhoods of beachside and hillside homes. The residential neighborhoods are complemented by amenities such as the beaches, trails, shops, and restaurants, and these amenities are easily accessible to residents and visitors. Ongoing public education, civic participation, and monitoring regional growth are keys to maintaining and enhancing the positive characteristics of the community.
2. Preserve and enbance the community's natural environment and distinctive setting in the region-a picturesque seaside community surrounded by hillside open space. The City's built environment is shaped and influenced by its natural setting. Scenic views of the Pacific coastline, hillsides, and canyons are distinctive elements of this setting and greatly enhance the community's image and sense of place. Ensuring that the City's environmentally sensitive surroundings are maintained as open space is vital to maintaining its character. As stewards of the environment, community members understand the importance of preserving environmentally sensitive open spaces, marine resources, water quality, and air quality for future generations. The City is committed to sustainable development patterns by ensuring that all future development complies with General Plan policies and development standards and that land zoned for open space is maintained in its natural condition.

3. Enhance recreational opportunities for residents and visitors, while protecting environmentally sensitive natural resources. Laguna Beach is situated in one of the most scenic settings in the State. Picturesque views of the Pacific coastline, hillsides, and canyons attract many visitors to the community year-round. Laguna Beach also has numerous environmentally sensitive areas and habitat that must be protected and preserved. The General Plan responds to this challenge directly and proactively, through a comprehensive, integrated strategy to facilitate and manage the influx of visitors in ways that deliberately avoid adverse effects on local resources. The General Plan

-. 2-7-12

Exhibit D Page 77

provides multiple policies designed to integrate resource protection with active planning to accommodate visitors.

4. Minimize the impact of the automobile on the character of Laguna Beach and emphasize a more pedestrian-oriented environment, safer sidewalks/pathways, landscaped buffer zones, and alternative means of transportation. Transportation alternatives are a high priority for Laguna Beach, particularly during the summer festival season. During the summer months and on holidays and weekends Laguna Beach is frequently impacted by traffic. Through its General Plan policies, the City continually strives to facilitate the movement of traffic in a safe and uncongested manner consistent with a pedestrian-oriented community. The proximity of some commercial and residential land uses in the City and mixed-use development are ideal for pedestrian and bicycle use. General Plan policies promote and encourage a pedestrian-oriented community by developing a system of bicycle rights-of-way and pedestrian paths, increasing alternative transit opportunities, and discouraging high-speed traffic along City streets.

5. Enhance the downtown by preserving its village character and ensuring a variety of unique businesses and activities. The City strives to preserve the village atmosphere of the downtown, which is characterized by its pedestrian orientation, low- scale buildings, a variety of commercial, restaurant, office, residential and public facilities uses, Main Beach, historic landmarks, and diverse architectural styles. The Downtown Specific Plan (DSP) is the primary means of implementing the General Plan policies to preserve the downtown. The DSP preserves the unique qualities of the downtown by establishing design guidelines and criteria for maintaining a balanced mix of land uses and addressing potential safety hazards.
6. Foster and promote a balance of retail opportunities for residents and visitors. a Laguna Beach is a highly desirable beach community and prime tourist destination. In order to preserve and provide a balanced mix of uses for both residents and tourists, the City has established districts for the location of visitor commercial and resident-serving uses.

7. Ensure development is responsive to individual site constraints, The General Plan recognizes that most development and/or redevelopment will inevitably involve infill projects or building on difficult sites, sites that are characterized by multiple constraints. General Plan policies set forth our philosophy that development, including remodels and the creation of new building sites, should begin with an awareness of constraints inherent in the particular site being developed. Planning, access, siting, and design choices should reflect a response to the particular characteristics and challenges associated with the site; examples include constraints related to the presence of significant natural resources and safety hazards as well as those related to the need for infill projects to be compatible in design, scale, and character with the surrounding neighborhood. Design guidelines, in conjunction with the applicable zoning standards, guide the Design Review Board toward approval of well-designed buildings, landscaping, and open spaces all of which reflect the quality and values of the

ii 2-7-12

Exhibit D Page 78

community, enhance the visual character of neighborhoods, and preserve views and privacy to the greatest extent feasible. The General Plan sets forth the philosophy is avoidance of negative impacts is preferred to mitigation of those impacts.
8. Ensure that infrastructure is strengthened and maintained. The City's public infrastructure supports the type, distribution, and intensity of land uses designated in the General Plan. Standards for capital facilities and public services such as streets, parks, storm drainage, water, sewers, and fire safety are established to ensure that growth does not exceed capacity. Although the community is essentially built-out, the General Plan reinforces the City's commitment to maintain and upgrade its aging infrastructure.
9. Encourage cultural, ethnic, and social diversity. Culture and the arts have been the cornerstones of the community for many years. Laguna Beach is widely known as the home of the summer art festivals and numerous local artists. Local playhouses, an art museum, an art college and numerous gallerics are indicative of the art influence in the community, To reinforce its commitment to the arts, the City has established the Arts Commission to review and recommend public art and to promote art-related uses throughout the community. The City has also adopted Historic Resources Element and a related ordinance to encourage the long-term preservation of historically significant buildings. The General Plan policies promote social diversity by planning for a range of housing types from single-family dwellings to multiple units and mixed-use developments, artists' live/work units, and low-income disabled, senior citizen, and studio housing.

10. Ensure that safety and disaster preparedness are considered in all City decisions. Hazard and risk evaluation is important in determining the appropriateness of land use changes, especially in the steep hillsides, rugged canyons, flood plains, and varied terrains of Laguna Beach. These topographic features accentuate geologic, hydrologic, and fire hazards and require thoroug evaluation and analysis as a part of the land use and design planning processes. The Land Use Element contains numerous policies that address hazard and safety planning. The City's Safety Element addresses emergency planning/response, hazardous materials, geologic hazards, fire hazards, flood hazards, and shoreline protection.
11. Ensure that sustainability guides City policy. The City recognizes the magnitude of the challenge that climate change poses. The City can move toward sustainability and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by the way it manages land development and building construction, conserves habitats and natural resources, provides efficient transportation and mobility systems, and develops its infrastructure and public services. Sites should be planned, buildings designed, and infrastructure developed to reduce the consumption of energy, water, and raw materials, generation of waste, and use of toxic and hazardous substances. The General Plan establishes a framework to ensure that the City is sustainable, resilient, and regenerative for residents, visitors, and future generations.

GOALS, POLICIES, ACTIONS AND
IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAM

The first six sections of this element describe the current and projected characteristics of the City and the land use categories that describe the use and intensity of development. These projections raise a number of issues that are addressed by the land use goals and policies established in this section. Additional issues and policies have been included as a result of citizen participation. These policies are of central importance because, in addition to representing the goals and priorities of the community, they function as regulations by which development projects will be measured. Zone changes and subdivision maps, for example, cannot be approved unless they are consistent with the policies in this section. This section also outlines the implementation/action of goals and policies. The City's adoption of the Land Use Element is a commitment to carry out the goals, policies, actions, and implementation program.

GOAL 7: Protect, preserve, and enhance the community's natural resources.
Intent - Having an abundance of scenic coastal, hillside, and canyon areas, the community has a lengthy history of stewardship to ensure the environmental protection of its natural resources. Long-term preservation of dedicated open space and coastal resources is of the highest priority. Policies in both the Land Use and Open Space/Conservation Elements require the protection and preservation of our magnificent natural resources for community members, visitors and future generations.

Policy 7.1 Protect dedicated and accepted open space.
Action 7.1.1 Ensure that the Open Space/Conservation Element includes policies to protect land dedicated for open space to the greatest extent. (Short-to-long-term implementation.)

Policy 7.2 Maintain the General Plan designation of Permanent Open Space and the Zoning designations of Open Space/Conservation and Open Space/Passive as a method of protecting natural resources.

Policy 7.3 Design and site new development to protect natural and environmentally sensitive resources, such as areas of unique scenic quality, public views, and visual compatibility with surrounding uses and to minimize natural landform alterations. (Sane as Policy 10.2.)

Action 7.3.1 Evaluate and, if necessary, adopt an Open Space/Conservation Element policy to ensure that environmentally sensitive species and/or habitat located within homeowners' associations are protected. (Medium-term
implementation.)

Action 7.3.2 Review all applications for new development to determine potential threats from coastal and other hazards. (Ongoing implementation.)
Action 7.3.3 Design and site new development to avoid hazardous areas and minimize risks to life and property from coastal and other hazards. (Ongoing implementation.)

Action 7.3.4 Require new development to assure stability and structural integrity, and neither create nor contribute significantly to erosion, geologic instability, or destruction of the site or surrounding area or in any way require the construction of protective devices that would substantially alter natural landforms along bluffs and cliffs. (Ongoing implementation.)
Action 7.3.5 Prohibit development on oceanfront bluff faces, except public improvements providing public access, protecting coastal resources, or providing for public safety. Permit such improvements only when no feasible alternative exists and when designed and constructed to minimize landform alteration of the oceanfront bluff face, to not contribute to further erosion of the oceanfront bluff
7 - 20 2-7-12

Exhibit D. - Page 82

face, and to be visually compatible with the surrounding area to the maximum extent feasible. (Ongoing implementation.)
Action 7.3.6 Require new development on oceanfront blufftop lots to incorporate drainage improvements, removal of and/or revisions to irrigation systems, and/or use of native or drought-tolerant vegetation into the design to minimize threats to occanfront bluff recession. (Ongoing implementation.)
Action 7.3.7 Require swimming pools located on oceanfront bluff properties to incorporate leak prevention and detection measures. (Ongoing implementation.)
Action 7.3.8 On oceanfront bluff sites, require applications where applicable, to identify and remove all unpermitted and/or obsolete structures, including but not limited to protective devices fences, walkways and stairways, which encroach into oceanfront bluffs. (Ongoing implementation.)
Action 7.3.9 Ensure that new development, major remodels and additions to existing structures on oceanfront and oceanfront bluff sites do not rely on existing or future bluff/shoreline protection devices to establish geologic stability or protection from coastal hazards. A condition of the permit for all such new development on bluff property shall expressly require waiver of any such rights to a new bluff/shoreline protection device in the future and recording of said waiver on the title of the property as a deed restriction.
Action 7.3.10 Allow oceanfront and oceanfront bluff homes, commercial structures, or other principal structures, that are legally nonconforming as to the oceanfront and/or oceanfront bluff edge setback, to be maintained and repaired; however, improvements that increase the size or degree of nonconformity, including but not limited to development that is classified as a major remodel pursuant to the definition in the Land Use Element Glossary, shall constitute new development and cause the pre-existing nonconforming oceanfront or oceanfront bluff structure to be brought into conformity with the LCP.
Action 7.3.11 Require all coastal development permit applications for new development on an oceanfront or on an oceanfront bluff property subject to wave action to assess the potential for flooding or damage from waves, storm surge, or seiches, through a wave uprush and impact report prepared by a licensed civil engineer with expertise in coastal processes. The conditions that shall be considered in a wave uprush study are: a seasonally eroded beach combined with long-term (75 years) erosion; high tide conditions, combined with long-term (75 year) projections for sea level rise; storm waves from a 100-year event or a storm that compares to the 1982/83 El Niño event. (Ongoing implementation.)
Action 7.3.12 Site and design new structures to avoid the need for shoreline and/or oceanfront bluff protective devices during the economic life of the structure (75 years). (Ongoing implementation.)

7- 21 2-7-12

Exhibit D Page 83

Action 7.3.13 Limit the use of shoreline/bluff protective devices to the minimum
required to protect existing development in danger from erosion. Site and design any such protective devices as far landward as possible. "Existing development" for purposes of this policy shall consist only of a principle structure, €.g. residential dwelling, required garage, or second residential unit, and shall not include accessory or ancillary structures such as decks, patios, pools, tennis
courts, cabanas, stairs, landscaping etc. No shoreline/bluff protective device shall be allowed for the sole purpose of protecting an accessory structure. (Ongoing implementation.)

Action 7.3.14 Develop and implement shoreline management plans for shoreline
areas subject to wave hazards and erosion. Shoreline management plans should
provide for the protection of existing development, public improvements, coastal
access, public opportunities for coastal recreation, and coastal resources. Plans
must evaluate the feasibility of coastal hazard avoidance, restoration of the sand
supply, beach nourishment and planned retreat. (Long-term implementation.)

Action 7.3.15 Prepare and periodically update comprehensive studies of seasonal and long-term shoreline change, episodic and chronic bluff retreat, flooding, and local changes in sea levels, and other coastal hazard conditions. (Long-term
implementation.)

Action 7.3.16 Continue to monitor beach width and elevations and analyze
monitoring data to establish approximate thresholds for when beach erosion or
deflation will reach a point that it could expose the backshore development to flooding or damage from storm waves or other coastal hazards. (Ongoing
implementation.)

Action 7.3.17 Discourage shoreline protective devices on public land to protect private property/development. (Ongoing implementation.)
Action 7.3.18 Site and design new oceanfront and oceanfront bluff development and bluff/shoreline protective devices where that siting/design takes into account predicted future changes in sea level. In particular, an acceleration of the historic rate of sea level rise shall be considered and based upon up-to-date scientific papers and studies, agency guidance (such as the 2010 Sea Level Guidance from the California Ocean Protection Council), and reports by national and international groups such as the National Research Council and the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Consistent with all provisions of the
LCP. new structures shall be set back sufficient distance landward to eliminate
or minimize, to the maximum extent feasible, hazards associated with anticipated sea level rise over the expected economic life of the structure.

Policy 7.4 Ensure that development, including subdivisions, new building sites and remodels with building additions, is evaluated to ascertain potential negative impacts on
natural resources. Proposed development shall emphasize impact avoidance over
impact mitigation. Any mitigation required due to an unavoidable negative
7 - 22 2-7-12

Exhibit D - Page 84

impact should be located on-site, where feasible. Any off-site mitigation should be located within the City's boundaries close to the project, where feasible. (Similar to Policies 5.2 and 10.3.)
Action 7.4.1 Prepare and adopt California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) thresholds of significance tailored to address the City's natural resources, such as marine resources, streams, drainage courses, ESHA and high- and very-high- value habitat. (Medium-term implementation.)
Action 7.4.2 Continue preparation of initial studies, pursuant to the California Environment Quality Act (CEQA), for any proposed development, including single-family residences located within environmentally sensitive areas. (Same as Action 10.3.1.)
Action 7.4.3 Review development to minimize adverse impacts to abutting dedicated open-space areas; taking into consideration both the appropriate habitat buffer zones and the required fuel modification zones. (Short-term
implementation.)

Action 7.4.4 Continue to list Environmentally Sensitive Areas within the Real Property Report. (Ongoing and short-to-long-term implementation.)

Policy 7.5 Require payment of an environmental impact fee for development whenever mitigation is not feasible and a nexus exists.
(Same as Policy 10.5.)
Action 7.5.1 Adopt appropriate mitigation measures that require the payment of environmental impact fees whenever impacts on environmental resources cannot be mitigated to a level of insignificance. (Ongoing implementation - short-to- medium-term.)
(Same as Action 10.5.1.)

Policy 7.6 Implement individualized fuel modification programs for existing legal building sites whenever environmentally sensitive resources are present.
Action 7.6.1 Allow fuel modification programs to be modified on existing legal building sites to address and mitigate impacts to environmentally sensitive resources, particularly for properties abutting open space areas. (Short-term implementation.)
Action 7.6.2 Allow fuel modification alternative means and methods for existing legal building sites in areas where high- and very-high-value habitat may otherwise be impacted and in areas where an Environmentally Sensitive Habitat Area (ESHA) ("ESHA" as defined in the LCP Glossary), may otherwise be impacted.

7 - 23 2-7-12

Exhibit D - Page 85

Action 10.3.1 Continue preparation of initial studies, pursuant to the California Environment Quality Act (CEQA), for any proposed development, including single-family residences, located within environmentally sensitive areas. (Same as Action 7.4.2.)

Action 10.3.2 Continue to require in-depth analysis of constraint issues for properties, especially those designated on the City's hazard maps so that the nature of the constraint and the best options for mitigation or avoidance will be considered at all stages of the approval process since these constraints may affect what development is appropriate for the property.
Policy 10.4 Implement and define "lot area" as the total area of the lot minus the area/property located westerly of the building setback lines as described in Section 25.50.004(B)(1)(2)(3) or the oceanfront bluff (*oceanfront bluff
in LCP Glossary), whichever is more restrictive. edge" as defined

Policy 10.5 Require payment of an environmental impact fee for development whenever mitigation is not feasible and a nexus exists.
(Same as Policy 7.5.)
Action 10.5.1 Adopt appropriate mitigation measures that require payment of environmental impact fees whenever impacts on environmental resources cannot be mitigated to a level of insignificance. (Short-to-medium-term implementation.) (Same as Action 7.5.1.)

Policy 10.6 Require all fuel modification to be located within the site being developed. Exceptions may be granted for existing legal building sites when findings can be made by the approval authority that other alternatives are not available and a strict application of this provision would endanger environmentally sensitive resources or deny a property owner reasonable use of an already existing legal building site. Fuel modification performed by private property owners cannot go beyond property lines without agreement by the adjacent property owners. Fuel modification on public land to protect existing development should be avoided whenever feasible; if avoidance isn't feasible, measures must be employed to minimize the amount of fuel modification necessary on public land. (Similar to Policy 7.6.)

Action 10.6.1 The development proposal should address the required fuel modification as part of the initial application and should integrate fuel modification provisions into the site plan in such a way as to minimize impact on existing native vegetation and areas of visual prominence. Any required thinning of flammable vegetation shall be conducted outside of the bird nesting season if feasible. Alternative means to thinning and/or removal of native vegetation for fire hazard management such as minimizing the building envelope, and/or siting of the structure(s) away from hazard areas, and/or use of fire retardant design and materials are preferred where feasible.

A-3 Exhibit D - Page 89 2-7-12

17. Build-Out - Development of land to its full potential or theoretical capacity as permitted under current or proposed planning or zoning designations. (See also "Carrying Capacity.")

18. California Building Code - California standard building code that sets forth minimum standards for construction.

19. California Coastal Trail - The California Coastal Conservancy's vision for a California Coastal Trail (CCT) is a continuous interconnected public trail system along the California coastline. While primarily for pedestrians, the Trail also accommodates a variety of additional user groups, such as bicyclists, wheelchair users, equestrians, and others as
opportunities allow.

20. California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) - A state law requiring state and local agencies to regulate activities with consideration for environmental protection. If a proposed activity has the potential for a significant adverse environmental impact, an environmental impact report (EIR) must be prepared and certified as to its adequacy before taking action on
the proposed project.

21. Capital Improvements Program (CIP) - A program established by a City and reviewed by its Planning Commission that schedules permanent improvements, usually for a minimum of five years in the future, to fit the projected fiscal capability of the local jurisdiction. The program generally is reviewed annually for conformance to and consistency with the General Plan.

22. Carrying Capacity - Used in determining the potential of an area to absorb development: 1) The level of land use, human activity, or development for a specific area that can be accommodated permanently without an irreversible change in the quality of air, water, land, or plant and animal habitats. 2) The upper limits of development beyond which the quality of human life, health, welfare, safety, or community character within an area will be impaired. 3) The maximum level of development allowable under current zoning.

30. Condominium A structure of two or more units, the interior spaces of which are individually owned while the balance of the property (both land and building) is owned in common by the owners of the individual units.

31. Consistent with - Free from significant variation or contradiction. The various diagrams, text, goals, policies and programs in the General Plan must be consistent with each other, not contradictory or preferential. The term "consistent with" is used interchangeably with "in conformance with." The courts have held that the phrase "consistent with" means "in agreement with; harmonious with." "Conformity" means "in harmony therewith or agreeable to" (Sec. 58 Ops. Cal. Atty. Gen. 21, 25 [1975]). California law requires that the General Plan be internally consistent and also requires consistency between a General Plan and implementation measures such as the Zoning Ordinance. As a general rule, an action program or project is consistent with the General Plan if, considering all its aspects, it will further the objectives and policies of the General Plan and not obstruct their attainment.

38. Density Bonus The allocation of development rights that allows a parcel to accommodate additional square footage or additional residential units beyond the maximum for which the parcel is zoned in return for the long-term restriction of certain percentages of units for very- low- or low-income households or senior citizen households. (See the Housing Element and California Density Bonus law for additional information.)

39. Design Review A discretionary review process adopted by the City that is intended to provide the following: 1) that development projects comply with the applicable standards and design guidelines and criteria; 2) that development projects focus on quality designs within a neighborhood context that results in creative design solutions for the City; 3) that development occur with an orderly and harmonious appearance, including associated facilities such as signs, landscaping and parking areas; 4) that public and private views are considered; 5) that public health, safety and general welfare throughout the City are considered; and 6) that there is effective implementation of the applicable General and Specific Plan policies that encourage the preservation and enhancement of the particular character and unique assets of the City.
