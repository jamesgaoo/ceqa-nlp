VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

INTRODUCTION

1. Petitioner Committee for a Better Arvin challenges the approval by
Respondents City of Arvin and its City Council (collectively the "City") of a conditional
use permit authorizing Real Parties in Interest Petro-Lud, Inc. and Clayton Ludington
("Petro-Lud") to drill four oil and gas wells in the heart of Arvin, in close proximity to
numerous homes (the "Project"). The City found the Project exempt from the California
Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq.,
under a "categorical exemption" intended for construction of a single-family home or a

small retail establishment-not an intensive industrial activity like oil and gas operations.
10 The City's approval of the Project was a clear abuse of discretion and should be set aside.

11 2. The Project would be located in the middle of a residential community
12 whose residents already suffer disproportionately from poor air and water quality and
13 associated health problems. As numerous residents testified to the City Council, the
14 Project's air pollution, noise, aesthetic, public safety, traffic, and other environmental
15 impacts would only compound these harms.

16 3. In the Project's exploratory stage, oil and gas drilling operations would be
17 conducted 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The drilling rig would be brightly lit all
18 night. If the exploration proved successful, the wells would be converted into production
19 wells, and produced oil and gas would be trucked or piped offsite through the community
20 for an indefinite period. The exploration and production activities would require the
21 construction and installation of substantial new industrial facilities and structures-
22 including large storage tanks, drilling rigs, storage pits, water tanks, walls and fencing, and
23 a 22 foot-wide access road accompanied by daily trucking of materials to and from the
24  site.

25 4. The City nonetheless determined that no CEQA review was required because
26 a "Class 3" categorical exemption-reserved for "small facilities or structures" like a
27 single-family home, a small multi-family dwelling, a retail shop, or a restaurant (see
28

2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

CEQA Guidelines section 153031)-applied to the intensive, industrial development
contemplated by the Project. The City's determination not only misinterpreted the law, but
also lacked evidentiary support. Moreover- -perhaps recognizing that the Class 3

4 exemption was an ill fit for oil and gas drilling operations-the City conditioned the
Project in ways clearly intended to reduce its environmental impacts. Here, again, the City

6 failed to follow the law, as CEQA does not allow the City to "mitigate" a project into
compliance with a categorical exemption. Finally, ignoring a mountain of evidence
showing that oil and gas drilling has significant environmental impacts-including its own
recent factual findings on the significant environmental impacts of oil and gas operations
10 in Arvin, adopted in support of an update to the City's oil and gas ordinance-the City
11 erroneously determined that the Project presented no "unusual circumstances" precluding
12 its reliance on the Class 3 exemption. See CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(c).
13 5. The City's unlawful and unsupported reliance on the Class 3 exemption in
14 approving the Project deprived both decisionmakers and the public of information CEQA
15 requires and precluded informed public participation. The City thus prejudicially abused its
16 discretion.

17 6. For these and other reasons, the City's approval of the Project must be set
18 aside, and all Project-related activities must be suspended, until the City has completed the
19 environmental review process in accordance with CEQA.
20 PARTIES

21 7. a Petitioner Committee for a Better Arvin ("CBA") is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit
22 organization whose members reside in Arvin, California and who will be negatively
23  impacted by the Project's adverse environmental impacts. CBA's mission is to improve the
24 quality of life in Arvin, to inform and unite the community and address problems facing it,
25 and to secure equality for all the City's residents. CBA and its members have advocated
26 for many years to improve local and regional air quality and seek to ensure that any
27 References to the "CEQA Guidelines" are to title 14, California Code of Regulations, 28 section 15000 et seq.
3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

continued oil and gas development in the region does not undermine these efforts. CBA
2 and its members are particularly concerned about the safety and health impacts of oil and
3 gas exploration and development within the City in close proximity to homes and
4| businesses, especially when undertaken without environmental review and without
measures to mitigate their impacts to the maximum extent feasible, as required by CEQA.

6 The interests that CBA seeks to further in this action are within the purposes and goals of
7 the organization.

8 8. CBA and its members are beneficially interested in this matter because they
have direct interests in ensuring that the City fulfills its duties to comply with CEQA and
10| in preserving and protecting the City's environment for the benefit of the general public.
11 These interests will be undermined by the Project, approval of which not only violated
12 CEQA but also would cause substantial and irreversible harm to the environment and the
13 health and welfare of the City's residents.

14 9. The maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a substantial
15 benefit on the public by protecting it from the environmental and other harms alleged
16 herein, and by ensuring that the City abides by the procedures required by law in
17 approving oil and gas projects like the one at issue here.

18 10. Respondent City of Arvin is, and at all time herein mentioned was, a general
19 law city in Kern County in the State of California responsible for administering and
20 carrying out its laws and applicable state laws. The City is the "lead agency" for the
21 Project for purposes of Public Resources Code section 21067 and is responsible for
22 complying with and implementing the provisions of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines.
23 11. Respondent City Council of the City of Arvin is, and at all times herein
24 mentioned was, the duly elected decisionmaking body of Respondent City of Arvin. The
25 City Council adopted the resolution approving the Project on September 4, 2018. The City
26 also authorized the filing of a CEQA Notice of Exemption, which was filed on September
27 7. 2018. As the decisionmaking body, the City Council was responsible under CEQA for
28 conducting a proper review of the Project's environmental impacts, evaluating mitigation
4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

measures and/or alternatives to lessen or avoid the Project's significant environmental
2 impacts, and otherwise complying with CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines.

3 12. Real Party in Interest Petro-Lud, Inc. ("Petro-Lud") is, and at all times herein

4 mentioned was, the Project applicant and recipient of the conditional use permit issued by

5 the City. Petitioner is informed and on that basis believes that Petro-Lud leased the

6 subsurface mineral rights to the Project area. Petro-Lud is listed as the Project applicant
7 and person carrying out the Project on the City's September 7, 2018 Notice of Exemption
8 for the Project.

13. Petitioner is informed, and on that basis believes, that Real Party in Interest
10 Clayton Ludington is President of Real Party in Interest Petro-Lud. Mr. Ludington signed
11 the application form for the Project and is listed as the Project applicant and applicant
12 contact on the City's September 7, 2018 Notice of Exemption for the Project.
13 14. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of Real Parties in

14 Interest Does 1 through 25, inclusive, and therefore sues said Real Parties in Interest under
15 fictional names. Petitioner is informed, and on that basis alleges, that each fictionally
16 named Real Party in Interest is responsible in some manner for committing the acts upon
17 which this action is based or has material interests affected by the Project or by the City's
18 actions with respect to the Project. Petitioner will amend this Petition to show their true
19 names and capacities if and when the same have been ascertained.
20 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

21 15. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs
22 in their entirety.
23 16. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant
24 to Code of Civil Procedure sections 526, 527, and 1094.5 (or, in the alternative, 1085), and
25 Public Resources Code sections 21168 (or, in the alternative, 21168.5) and 21168.9.
26- 17. Venue for this action is proper in this Court pursuant to Code of Civil
27 Procedure section 393(b) because the cause of action alleged in this Petition arose in Kern
28 County, where the Project is located and would be carried out. Venue is also proper in this
5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 395 because the City and its City

2 Council are located in Kern County.

3 18. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code
4 section 21167.5 by serving a written notice of Petitioner's intent to commence this action

5 by mail on the City on September 28, 2018. A true and correct copy of this written notice

6 and proof of service are attached as Exhibit A to this Petition.
19. Petitioner is complying with the requirements of Public Resources Code
a 8 section 21167.6 by concurrently filing a notice concerning preparation of the record of

9 administrative proceedings related to this action.

10 20. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code
11 section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 by furnishing the Attorney
12 General of the State of California with a copy of the Petition. A true and correct copy of
13 this written notice is attached as Exhibit B to this Petition.

14 21. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant
15 action and has exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent
16 possible as required by law.

17 22. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary
18 law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require the City to set aside
19 its approval of the Project, and enjoins any activities in furtherance of the Project, until the
20 City complies with CEQA. In the absence of such remedies, the City's approval will
21 remain in effect in violation of state law, and Petitioner, the environment, and residents in
22 the communities near the Project site will be irreparably harmed. No money damages or
23 legal remedy could adequately compensate for that harm.
24 STATEMENT OF FACTS

25 23. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs
26 in their entirety.

27 Oil and Gas Drilling in the City of Arvin

28 24. Numerous studies document the severe adverse environmental impacts
6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

associated with oil and gas drilling as well as the associated harms to public health and

2 safety. For instance, studies submitted by Petitioners to the City Council in comments on
the Project show that emissions from oil and gas operations pollute the air, water, and soil.
a 4 They carry a serious risk of hazardous chemical releases. They tax scarce water supplies.
And they emit noxious odors and disruptive noise. The studies further show that these
6 stressors, among others, can lead to developmental and reproductive effects, respiratory

7 illnesses, and other forms of chronic disease, as well as reduce the general quality of life
8 for those who reside in close proximity to oil and gas operations.
25. The City of Arvin adopted an Updated Oil and Gas Ordinance (Arvin
10 Municipal Code ch. 17.46) on July 17, 2018, to address concerns about these impacts,
11 particularly on nearby residents. Among other measures, the revised ordinance increased
12 the setback requirements for oil and gas wells to 300 feet from the property boundaries of
13 any residence and 300 feet from the boundaries of certain commercially designated zones.
14 It also mandates a community alert system plan for drill sites within 600 feet of a
15 prohibited zone, an emergency response plan for all projects, and continuous air quality
16 monitoring for projects within 1,000 feet of a prohibited zone.

17 26. In support of the updated ordinance, the City adopted numerous factual
18 findings regarding the severity of impacts from oil and gas drilling on residents and the
19 environment, which echo the studies submitted by Petitioners. The City, for instance,
20 found that "[d]evelopment and production of oil and gas operations involve multiple
21 sources of physical stressors such as noise, light, vibrations, toxicants, and impacts on air
22 emissions" and that "chemicals used in drilling and other stages of gas operations may
23 have long-term health effects not immediately expressed." Other findings documented the
24 potential of oil and gas operations to harm the City's and region's water supplies and water
25 quality, air quality, and aesthetics, as well as the risks associated with surface spills and
26 leaks and the nuisance caused by the significant truck traffic attendant to the operations.
27 Based on these and other impacts, the City found oil and gas development projects to be
28 "industrial operations that are incompatible with residential uses and quality of life" and
7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

determined that all petroleum operations should be directed away from areas with
2 residential land use designations.

3 27. The California Attorney General's Office sent comments to the City

4 regarding its updated ordinance. In those comments, the Attorney General stated that "[o]il

5 and gas production is a source of pollutants such as hydrogen sulfide, benzene,

6 formaldehyde, hexane, and xylene." The letter further stated that active oil and gas
7 production sites located in the City "contribute to the City's air pollution problems" and
cause deleterious public health impacts. Active oil and gas operations also carry severe

9 public safety risks. In 2014, eight Arvin families were evacuated after a toxic gas leak was
10 detected from an underground oilfield production pipeline near their homes.
11 28. Despite this extensive evidence, including its own factual findings in support
12 of the updated ordinance, the City proceeded to approve the Project without conducting
13 any meaningful environmental review and without either applying its updated ordinance or
14| heeding its core purpose: to separate harmful oil and gas development activities from
15 residential life.

16 II. Project Site
17 29. The Project would be located just south of the center of the City of Arvin in
18 the middle of a residential community. The City's residents are predominantly Hispanic
19 and low-income, and the community has a higher percentage a of young children than other
20 California communities.

21 30. The City is located in the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley, which is
22 home to most of the oil and gas production activities in the state.

23 31. The California Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Environmental
24 Health Hazard Assessment ranks the City as one of the most overburdened communities in
25 California. Its residents are exposed to higher levels of ozone, particulate matter, and
26 drinking water contaminants than the vast majority of communities in the state. Associated
27 health conditions such as asthma, Valley fever, and cancer are common afflictions for
28 residents.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

32. The proposed oil and gas wells would be located on a single parcel, APN

2 189-351-36, at the southwest corner of the intersection of Sycamore Road and Meyer
3 Street. The parcel is zoned C-2 General Commercial. The parcel is situated in the northeast

4 corner of a larger, undeveloped area bounded by Sycamore Road to the north, Meyer Street

5 to the east, Felecita Road to the south, and numerous residences to the west. Residences-
6 both single family homes and apartment complexes surround the area on all sides,

7 including the northeast corner parcel where drilling is proposed. An elementary school is
8 located a few blocks south of the parcel, along with two city parks, one just to the south
9  and another several blocks to the north.

10 33. The parcel is owned by Westminster Capital, Inc. (*Westminster").
11 Westminster provided written and oral comments to the Planning Commission expressing
12 concern with the Project and contesting the City's a reliance on a CEQA exemption.
13 Following the Planning Commission's action, Westminster appealed the Project's approval
14 to the City Council. Petitioner is informed and on that basis believes that Westminster had
15 hoped the parcel would host commercial developments to serve the surrounding residential
16 community. Petitioner is also informed, and on that basis believes, that future residential
17 development is contemplated for other portions of the area in which the parcel is located.
18 III. Project Proposal

19 34. On December 6, 2017, Petro-Lud submitted its initial application for a
20 conditional use permit ("CUP") to the City seeking authorization to drill and operate a
21 single oil and gas exploration well. The initial application sought approval for a 200 by
22 300 foot drill pad, which would be accessed via existing roads. The total estimated drill
23 time was estimated to take approximately 20 days.

24 35. The initial application did not clearly specify whether the CUP would be
25 intended to cover not only exploratory drilling, but also all future oil and gas production
26 activities if exploration proved successful. However, Petro-Lud clarified in a letter dated
27 January 10, 2018 that it intended to seek approval for both exploration and production by
28 way of the same CUP application.
0
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

36. After the Commission received public comments and an air pollution
2 appraisal regarding the initial application, Petro-Lud submitted a revised operational

3 statement for the Project, dated May 9, 2018, which greatly expanded the Project's scope

4 beyond the activities contemplated in the initial application.

5 37. In its revised operational statement, Petro-Lud essentially quadrupled the

6 scale of the Project, seeking approval for four oil and gas exploration and production wells
7 rather than a single exploration well. It also increased the size of the proposed drill site to
8 approximately 300 by 500 feet and changed its proposed location to just 80 feet south of
9 Sycamore Road and 290 feet west of Meyer Street.
10 38. Petro-Lud's revised operational statement proposed that for each of the four
11 wells, a 64 square foot temporary well cellar would be built and a conductor pipe would be
12 cemented, extending a to a depth of around 80 feet. Following this preliminary work, a
13 mobile drilling rig would be set up to drill each well. Around 30 tractor and trailer loads of
14 equipment would be moved in to erect the drilling rig, with 5 to 10 tractor and trailer loads
15 moving in and out every day.

16 39. Petro-Lud further proposed that during the drilling of each well, around
17 1,500 barrels or up to 400 tons of solid cutting would be removed from the well and stored
18 in an open pit 25 feet wide and 150 feet long. The drilling would also produce around
19 1,500 barrels of drilling mud. If no hazardous materials were located in the solid cuttings.
20 or mud, the material would either be hauled off site at the end of the drilling or spread on
21 location to build it up for the construction of production facilities.
22 40. Petro-Lud estimated that the preliminary work to drill the well cellars and

23 cement the pipes would take four to six days, and the work to move in and set up the
24 mobile drilling rig would take an additional two days per well.

25 41. Petro-Lud estimated that 500 barrels of water per day would be used during
26 the drilling operations, all of which would be trucked in and stored in an onsite water tank.
27 Similarly, wastewater would be transported offsite by a private company.
28 42. To provide access to the site and to accommodate the substantial trucking of
10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

water, equipment, and any produced oil, Petro-Lud proposed to construct a 22 foot wide
2 access road, extending 290 feet from Meyer Street to the drilling pad.

3 43. Petro-Lud estimated that the total timeframe for drilling all four wells would

4 be up to 120 days, or four months, in duration, but only if all wells were drilled

5 simultaneously. A City Planning Commission staff report, however, stated that no more

6 than one drilling rig would be present on the location at any time meaning that the wells
7 cannot be drilled simultaneously. Nor did Petro-Lud's estimated timeframe account for a
8 Project condition allowing Petro-Lud to keep the rig on site for up to 90 days following
9 cessation of drilling operations.

10 44. During active drilling operations, drilling would occur continuously, 24
11 hours per day, seven days per week, and would be performed by drilling crews working
12 twelve-hour shifts. According to information provided by the applicant, each drilling rig
13 would be powered by two 500-horsepower main rig engines, a 1000-horsepower pump
14 engine, and one to two 50-horsepower auxiliary engines. Diesel fuel would be stored in
15 tanks on site to fuel the drilling rig, and drilling fluids would be mixed on site and stored in
16 above ground steel tanks. The rig and location would be lighted all night long.
17 45. On an average day during the exploration phase of the Project, around 6 to
18 10 workers would be required on site, with 10 to 12 additional workers coming and going
19 with supplies and to perform various activities. In addition to the vehicular movement
20 caused by these workers, large trucks would visit the site about twice per day to haul
21 equipment and materials.

22 46. If exploration proved successful for any of the wells, Petro-Lud would
23 convert the well to a longer-term production well and replace the drilling rig with a smaller
24 completion rig. In addition, Petro-Lud proposed that a permanent tank battery and
25 separation and processing system would be installed on the site, including three tanks, each
26 | 16 feet high and 22 feet in diameter. The entire production site would be surrounded by an
27 8 foot high fence topped with razor ribbon.

28 47. If the well primarily produced oil, initial testing would be conducted for
11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

about six months, with oil stored in portable tanks during the initial test period. Permanent

2 facilities would then be constructed and, if sufficient oil were found, it would be trucked
from the site, beginning with one or two truckloads per day and possibly increasing
depending on the oil yield. If the well primarily produced natural gas or associated gas
with oil, the gas would be flared during an initial testing period of up to six months.
6 Permanent facilities would then be constructed and the gas would be transported by
pipeline, flared, or reinjected.
48. Petro-Lud stated that it hoped the economic life of the production wells

9 would be twenty years or longer. It did not place any limits on the operational time for the
10| production phase of the Project.
11 IV. Approval of Mitigated Project
12 49. Planning Commission staff prepared a staff report concerning Petro-Lud's
13 revised and expanded application. The staff report's description of the Project and
14 discussion of its possible impacts on noise, air quality, and other values consisted largely
15 of information supplied by Petro-Lud.

16 50. The Planning Commission staff report recommended that the Commission
17 approve the CUP subject to a number of conditions. Those conditions serve to mitigate the
18 Project's impacts on public health, safety, and the environment. Among other things, Staff
19 recommended:

20 a. Requiring the drill site to have a setback of at least 175 feet from the

21 center line of Sycamore Road to allow for commercial development along the road.
22 b. Requiring that pumping wells be operated by electric motors or

23 muffled internal combustion engines and that the height of all pumping units be limited to
24 20 feet.

25 C. Requiring that the drill site be fenced or walled prior to the
26 commencement of any drilling operations, with the fence or wall height a minimum of six
27 feet and razor wire prohibited. Permanent opaque fencing must also be installed six months
28 after the completion of the drilling activities and coated with anti-graffiti paint.
12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

d. Requiring landscaping around the outer fence or wall.

2 e. Restricting the hours for delivery of equipment or materials to
3 between 8 am and 8 pm except in case of emergency.

4 f. Requiring that any permanent equipment installed at the drill site be
5 painted, kept in neat condition, and maintained.

6 g. Requiring suitable and adequate sanitary toilet and washing facilities

7 on-site and proof of continued maintenance from a private company.

8 h. Requiring implementation of dust suppression methods.
51. Planning Commission staff also clarified that, based on Petro-Lud's revised
10 operational statement checklist, the Commission would consider the CUP application as
11 covering both the exploration and production phases of the Project. That is, no additional
12 approval would be required to convert the exploration wells into production wells.

13 52. The Planning Commission considered the conditioned CUP application at a
14 public meeting on May 30, 2018. Representatives of both CBA and Westminster spoke
15 against the Project, expressing concerns with the Project's impacts on the City's air, water,
16 and soil. Westminster's comments also specifically contested staff's proposal to deem the
17 project exempt from CEQA.
18 53. The Planning Commission initially voted 3-1 against staff's proposed
19 resolution approving the Project. After the initial vote, the City Attorney turned to the
20 audience and asked Petro-Lud's representative if Petro-Lud would consider litigation if the
21 Project were denied. Petro-Lud's representative replied in the affirmative. The City
22 Attorney then proposed, and the Planning Commission voted to convene, an emergency
23 closed session.

24 54. After reconvening in open session, the Planning Commission voted to
25 reconsider its initial vote and to approve the CUP subject to several additional
26 modifications. Those modifications, among other things, increased the drill site area to 400
27 feet by 400 feet, increased the setback from the centerline of Sycamore Street to 235 feet,
28 and barred the use of pipelines to transport produced oil from the site, although pipelines to
13
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

transport natural gas still would be permitted. With these conditions added, the
2 Commission determined that the Project was subject to CEQA's Class 3 categorical
3 exemption for "small facilities or structures."

4 55. Westminster appealed the Planning Commission's decision to the City

5 Council on June 11, contesting the Planning Commission's reliance on a Class 3 a
6 categorical CEQA exemption.

7 56. CBA appealed the Planning Commission's approval to the City Council on
8 June 13. CBA's appeal letter documented numerous violations of CEQA, including the
9 Planning Commission's improper reliance on a Class 3 exemption, its failure to consider
10 the significant known environmental and public health impacts associated with oil and gas
11 operations, and its improper reliance on mitigation measures in determining that the Class
12 3 exemption applied.

13 57.
P CBA's appeal also noted that the Commission failed to comply with the
14 Updated Oil and Gas Ordinance, which the Commission had approved on June 12, 2018.
15 CBA's appeal further pointed out that the Commission's approval of the Project
16 contravened the City's own factual findings, adopted in support of the Updated Oil and
17 Gas Ordinance, concerning the severe threat to City residents and the environment posed
18 by oil and gas operations.

19 58. CBA submitted a supplemental letter to the City Council on August 15,
20 2018, urging it reverse the Commission's decision and require compliance with the
21 Updated Oil and Gas Ordinance, which the City Council had adopted after a second
22 reading on July 17, 2018. As further evidence of the Project's environmental impacts,
23 CBA provided links to and summaries of 60 studies and articles documenting the
24 environmental, public health, and social harms associated with oil and gas production
25 activities, including those conducted within or in close proximity to residential
26 communities.

27 59. The City Council considered the appeals at its August 21, 2018 meeting.
28 Representatives of CBA and Westminster argued that the appeals should be granted.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Numerous residents of Arvin, including those living and working near the Project site, also
2 testified against the Project, citing existing environmental and health burdens facing their
families and community. CBA members and other Arvin residents also testified that the
4 City's approval of the CUP would lead to further environmental degradation and impact
the health and welfare of residents, particularly vulnerable populations such as children
6 and the elderly.

60. During the August 21 City Council hearing, the City Attorney repeatedly
advised City Council members that their discretion with respect to the appeal was
extremely limited, and that they were constrained to uphold the Planning Commission
10 decision if substantial evidence supported it, without making any changes to the permit
11 conditions. One councilmember indicated at the close of public hearing that she wished she
12 could deny the permit or make changes to its conditions but believed that she was required
13 to uphold it because she was acting in a judicial role. Another councilmember indicated
14 that only "feelings and speculation" were put forward about the relationship between oil
15 and gas activities and illness, without any mention of the numerous studies in the record or
16 the Council's own factual findings in support of the Updated Oil and Gas Ordinance.
17 61. At the conclusion of the August 21 hearing, the City Council voted to deny
18 the appeals and directed staff to return with a resolution for the Council's consideration at

19 its next regular meeting.

20 62. On September 4, CBA wrote a letter to the City Council urging it to delay
21 adoption of the proposed resolution returned by Council staff because it was legally and
22 factually inaccurate. In particular, CBA warned that:

23 a. The proposed resolution erred in construing the Class 3 categorical 3
24 exemption to apply to the Project and in finding that substantial evidence supported the
25 exemption;

26 b. The proposed resolution erred in reciting that the City Council has
27 "more limited discretion when reviewing appeals involving a conditional use permit,' as
28 no provision of the City's Municipal Code altered the ordinary de novo standard of review
15
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- applicable to such appeals; and

2 C. The proposed resolution erred in concluding that the Updated Oil and
3 Gas Ordinance did not apply to the Project.

4 63. The City Council did not heed CBA's request. Instead, at its September 4,
5 2018 meeting, it adopted Resolution No. 2018-60 denying CBA's and Westminster's
6 appeals, affirming the Planning Commission's approval of the CUP subject to the
7 mitigating conditions, and finding the Project eligible for a Class 3 categorical CEQA
8 exemption.

9 64. The Resolution not only denied the appeals and affirmed the Planning
10 Commission's decision, but also independently approved the Project as conditioned.
11 65. The Resolution concluded that the Updated Oil and Gas Ordinance did not
12 apply to the Project. Instead, the Resolution evaluated the Project under provisions of its
13 former oil and gas ordinance.

14 66. The Resolution adopted conditions of approval designed to reduce the
15 Project's environmental impacts. These included setback requirements (235 feet from the
16 centerline of Sycamore Road and 165 feet from the centerline of Meyer Street) that went
17 beyond those prescribed in provisions of the former oil and gas ordinance deemed
18 applicable to the Project.
19 67.

20 to The Resolution included an exhibit setting forth CEQA findings purporting
support the Class 3 categorical exemption. Among other things, the findings noted that
21 the entire Project footprint would be less than 2,300 square feet and that the drilling would
22 be a "temporary activity" anticipated to last for less than 120 days. However, the findings
23 did not adequately address numerous other aspects of the Project, including but not limited
24 to the 22 foot by 290 foot access road Petro-Lud was authorized to construct to provide
25 access from Meyer Street to the drill site, the projected depth of the wells, or the height,
26 continuous operation, and night lighting of the rigs. Nor did the findings adequately
27 address the conversion of the exploratory wells to long-term production wells, with
28 construction and operation of production facilities for an indefinite period, if the
16
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

exploratory activities proved successful.

2 68. The CEQA findings also concluded that there were no "unusual
3 circumstances" precluding reliance on the Class 3 exemption. In support of this

4 conclusion, the City Council found that conditions like poor air quality, poor water quality,
5 Valley fever, asthma, and cancer are not "unusual" in the Project region.

6 69. The City further found that it was "not bound by" its own factual findings,

7 adopted in support of the Updated Oil and Gas Ordinance, regarding the adverse
8  environmental and health impacts of oil and gas drilling in the City.
9 70. On September 7, 2018, the City Council filed a Notice of Exemption with
10 Kern County, asserting that the Project falls within CEQA's 3 Class 3 categorical exemption
11 and that none of the exceptions to the categorical exemption apply.

12 71. On September 7, 2018, Petro-Lud sent Westminster a notice of surface
13 disturbance activities for oil and gas development purposes. The notice stated that Petro-
14 Lud planned to begin surface preparation for purposes of conducting oil and gas operations
15 on or about October 8, 2018. The notice also stated that Petro-Lud may install permanent
16 well equipment and continue operations "of indeterminate duration."
17 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

18 (Violation of CEQA, Public Resources Code ยง 21000 et seq.)

19 72. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs
20 in their entirety.
21 73. CEQA is designed to ensure that long-term protection of the environment is
22 the guiding criterion in discretionary public decisions. CEQA accomplishes its purposes by
23 requiring public agencies to determine, and to disclose to the public through an
24 Environmental Impact Report, detailed information about the effect that a proposed project
25 is likely to have on the environment, to list ways in which the effects of the project might
26 be avoided or minimized, and to develop and compare alternatives to the project. CEQA
27 also mandates that the lead agency adopt feasible and enforceable mitigation measures that
28 would reduce or avoid any of a project's significant environmental impacts. Separately
17
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

identifying and analyzing mitigation measures ensures that environmental impacts are
2 reduced to the greatest extent possible as a result of informed decisionmaking. Lotus v.

3 Dept. of Transportation (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th 645, 658.

4 74. CEQA exempts several narrow categories of projects; these exemptions are

5 known as "categorical exemptions." Categorical exemptions allow agencies to forgo

6 CEQA review for projects that the state, exercising authority delegated by the Legislature,
has determined are not the kinds of projects that have significant environmental impacts.
See Pub. Res. Code ยง 21084. Categorical exemptions must be construed narrowly to afford

9 the fullest possible environmental protection. Save Our Carmel River v. Monterey
10 Peninsula Water Management Dist. (2006) 141 Cal. App. 4th 677, 697. If an agency
11 | determines in its preliminary assessment of a project that it does not fit within a categorical
12 exemption, it must then identify and consider appropriate mitigation measures during the
13 subsequent environmental review process. Azusa Land Reclamation Co. v. Main San
14 Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997) 52 Cal. App. 4th 1165, 1199-1200. However, an
15 agency cannot determine that a project is categorically exempt from CEQA by imposing
16 mitigation measures. Salmon Protection & Watershed Network v. County of Marin (2004)
17 125 Cal. App. 4th 1098, 1102.

18 75. The City's decision to approve the Project was a discretionary action subject a
19 to CEQA.

20 76. The City violated CEQA by relying on a Class 3 categorical exemption to
21 evade required environmental review. The Class 3 exemption applies to "construction and 3
22 location of limited numbers of new, small facilities or structures" as well as the
23 "installation of small new equipment and facilities in small structures." CEQA Guidelines
24 15303. The CEQA Guidelines provide several examples of projects subject to the

25 exemption, including a single-family home, a second dwelling unit, a duplex or multi-
26 family residential structure with no more than four dwelling units, and a "store, motel,
27 office, restaurant or similar structure not involving the use of significant amounts of
28 hazardous substances" and not exceeding 2,500 square feet in floor area. CEQA
18
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Guidelines ยง 15303(a)-(c).

2 77. The City's determination that the Project qualifies for this exemption was
3 legally and factually erroneous:

a. The City erred as a matter of law in interpreting the exemption as
5 applicable to the Project. Oil and gas exploration and production activities differ
categorically from the types of small structures with minimal environmental impacts
7 included in Class 3. Oil and gas operations are also associated with hazardous materials
8 and emissions of toxic air contaminants. The City's application of the Class 3 exemption to

9 this Project rests on an unreasonable and impermissible construction of the CEQA
10 Guidelines.

11 b. The City's determination that the Project qualifies for a Class 3
12 exemption also was not supported by substantial evidence in the record. For example, the
13 City's exemption finding was based largely a on a very narrow interpretation of the Project's
14 footprint after drilling is completed. However, it ignored evidence that the Project would
15 require a 22 foot wide access road extending for nearly 300 feet in addition to the
16 approximately 2,300 square feet of wells and surrounding structures and facilities. And it
17 disregarded evidence that a drilling pad measuring 160,000 square feet in size, including a
18 3,750 square foot open waste pit, would be used during the entire exploration phase of the
19 Project. The City also failed to adequately consider impacts from round-the-clock
20 operation of equipment during both drilling and production, long-term flaring of natural
21 gas, the height of the drilling rig, night lighting, noise, vibration, and odors. Moreover,
22 although the City attempted to analogize the Project to a retail or small commercial
23 operation, it failed to address voluminous evidence in the record regarding the hazardous
24 materials and emissions associated with oil and gas exploration and production. The City
25 further relied on the "short duration" of the Project, but it ignored evidence that the Project
26 could be extended indefinitely if sufficient quantities of oil or gas were located during the
27 Project's exploration phase. The City also accepted the applicant's description of the
28 Project and assessment of its environmental impacts without meaningful independent
19
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

analysis.

2 78. The City further violated CEQA by finding that exceptions precluding

3 reliance on a categorical exemption were inapplicable. No categorical exemption may be
4  used where there is a reasonable possibility that the Project will have a significant
5 environmental effect due to unusual circumstances. CEQA Guidelines ยง 15300.2(c). The

6 Project's characteristics, including its location of industrial oil and gas facilities in the
7 middle of a residential community already bearing heavy environmental and health

8 burdens, present unusual circumstances that create the reasonable possibility of significant

9 public health impacts. The Project's significant difference in kind from the types of low-
10 impact projects listed in Section 15303 likewise presents an unusual circumstance that
11 precludes application of a categorical exemption.
12 79. Use of a categorical exemption is also improper where a project will cause
13 significant adverse impacts. Berkeley Hillside Preservation v. City of Berkeley (2015) 60
14 Cal. 4th 1086, 1105. Here, the record is replete with evidence that the Project will have
15 significant adverse environmental impacts, including but not limited to public health, air
16 and water quality, public safety, traffic, noise, and aesthetic impacts.

17 80. The City further violated CEQA by relying on mitigation measures to find
18 the Project categorically exempt. The City conditioned the Project approval on
19 modifications to site setbacks, height, fencing, and various other Project features. These
20 conditions were intended to reduce the visual, public safety, and other environmental
21 impacts of this specific Project. Mitigation measures cannot be used to support a finding
22 that a categorical exemption applies, but rather must be proposed and adopted through the
23 normal CEQA process.
24 81. The City's errors were prejudicial in that they precluded informed
25 decisionmaking and informed public participation, deprived both the public and
26 decisionmakers of substantial relevant information about the Project's environmental
27 effects, and precluded informed consideration of other feasible mitigation measures and
28 alternatives that might have reduced or avoided those effects.
20
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

82. In view of the foregoing violations of CEQA, the City prejudicially abused
2 its discretion in approving the Project. Approval of the Project therefore must be set aside.

3 PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as follows:

5 1. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to

6 vacate and set aside their approval of the Project;

2. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to
8 comply with the requirements of CEQA, and to take any other action required by Public
9 Resources Code section 21168.9;

10 3. For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and
11 permanent injunctions restraining Respondents and Real Parties in Interest and their
12 agents, servants, employees, officers, and representatives from undertaking any action to
13 implement the Project pending full compliance with the requirements of CEQA;

14 4. For costs of the suit;

15 5. For Petitioner's attorneys' fees as authorized by Code of Civil Procedure
16 section 1021.5 and other applicable authority; and
17 6, For such other and future relief as the Court deems just and proper.
