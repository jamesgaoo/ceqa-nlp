Res. Code $21167.7)] Trial Date: September 27, 2018

Dear Ms. Magnani:

Pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 21167.7, enclosed please find file-marked copy the above-referenced amended pleading.

Summary of Issues

For your convenience, the issues raised in this action include the following:

1. The inadequate preservation and protection of undeveloped open space in, and abutting, the historic Mussel Slough riparian corridor within the City of Hanford;
2. The application of SB 1000 (Environmental Justice) in this community that has a
plurality of Latin American residents;

3. How developed and undeveloped open space for public use is calculated for purposes of public access to this limited natural resource; and

4. The improper manner in which the developed open space calculation has been made by the City Council in the Hanford 2035 General Plan Update and the Final EIR for this project.

Thank you for your review and consideration of this matter. Under separate cover, I have forwarded a copy of this letter, only, to Arsenio Mataka for his information, in case he is interested in these issues.

Respectfully yours,

2 Comes now, Petitioner and Plaintiff, San Joaquin Valley Environmental Defense Center,
and as its Petition for Writ of Administrative and Traditional Mandate and Complaint for
Declaratory Relief, allege as follows:

5 JURISDICTION

6 This Court has jurisdiction over this cause and a to issue a Writ of Mandate to vacate,

7 set aside, rescind, void, and annul the decisions and actions complained of herein, based upon

8 violations of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) [Public Resources Code, section

9 21000 et seq.] and the CEQA Guidelines [California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 14,

10 section 15000 et seq.l; and the California Planning and Zoning Law [Government Code (Govt.

11 C.) section 65300 et seq.].

12 VENUE
2.
13 Venue is proper in this Court because Respondents, City of Hanford ("City") and

14 the Hanford City Council ("Council") have their principal place of business located in the City of
Hanford and the County of Kings, and the actions complained of herein occurred within the City
15 of Hanford and the County of Kings; and the planning area which is the subject to the decisions
16 and actions of Respondents is located in the City of Hanford in the County of Kings.
17 EXHAUSTION OF REMEDIES
18 3.
19 Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this action and
has exhausted any and all available administrative remedies required by law or in equity. 20 4.
21 Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law
unless the Court grants this Amended Petition for Writ of Administrative Mandate and/or
22

23 Traditional Mandate to order, command, and direct the Respondents, City of Hanford and

24 Hanford City Council to vacate and set aside their decisions and actions complained of herein,

25 including without limitation, the City's failure and refusal to comply with the requirements of the
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) [Public Resources Code (PRC) section 21000, et 26

27 seq.] alleged herein and the City's failure to comply with the applicable provisions of the

28 California Government Code governing the approval and adoption by the City, through its
Council, of the City of Hanford 2035 General Plan (GPA 2017-02) and Zoning Ordinance

2

-

(Resolution No. 17-04), and certification of the Final Environmental

2 Impact Report (FEIR)

3 [State Clearinghouse Number 2015041024] for the GPU, upon which the Zoning Ordinance is
based.

4 5.

5 In the absence of such remedy, the Respondents' findings, decisions, and actions
will remain in full force and effect, in violation of state law and significant adverse effects to the

6 physical environment will occur, instead of being avoided or mitigated, as required by CEQA

7 and the procedural requirements of CEQA and the Planning and Zoning Act, Government Code
section 65300
8 et seq. will be violated by Respondents due to Respondents' failure to proceed in

9 the manner required by law referred to hereinabove.

10 PARTIES

6.

11 Petitioner, SJVEDC is a public interest citizens' organization which provides

12 legal assistance, support, and representation to local residents and taxpayers in the San Joaquin

6 Zoning Act ("SPZA").

7 9. Respondent and Defendant City of Hanford ("City") is a municipal corporation

8 governed by the laws of the State of California and is governed by the Hanford City Council
9 ("Council"), duly elected by the voters residing within the jurisdiction of the City and, as such, IS

10 authorized and obligated by law to act on behalf of its constituents and for their general health,
11 safety, and welfare, to protect and defend them against threatened injuries and violations of thein

12 civil and constitutional rights, and to observe and comply with the laws of the United States of
13 America and the State of California. The City Council members who heard and decided the
14 Appeal of Petitioner were Justin Mendes (Mayor), Francisco Ramirez (Vice Mayor), David G.
15 Ayers, and Martin Devine. Councilmember Sue Sorenson recused herself and did not participate
16 in the deliberation, decisions, or actions challenged herein, and is not sued in any capacity
17 herein, accordingly.

18 STANDING

19 10. Petitioner represents the public interest and initiates this legal action on behalf of

26 of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States and Article 1,

27 section 7(a) of the Constitution of the State of California.

28

4

12. Petitioner and its members and supporters, as well as the members of the general

2 public, are likely to suffer significant adverse effects to the physical environment as a result of

3 Respondents' decisions, actions, and omissions; Petitioner's members and supporters are within

4 the class of persons beneficially interested in, and aggrieved by, the wrongful actions and

5 omissions of the Respondents; to-wit, the failure of the Respondents to proceed in the mannen

6 required by law.

7 13. Petitioner and its members, supporters, and other members of the general public

8 have a substantial beneficial interest in ensuring that the Respondents' decisions are made, and
9 actions taken, only in conformance with the policies and procedures required by law, in having

10 laws properly executed, and in having public duties enforced and discharged, pursuant to Public

11 Resources Code Sections 21168 and 21168.5, Government Code section 65300 et seq., and the

12 U.S. Constitution and the California Constitution.

13 14. Petitioner acts herein through its a counsel as a private attorney general, pursuant to
14 Code of Civil Procedure 1021.5, to compel Respondents and its employees, agents, and servants
15 and the Applicant to follow and enforce the state laws, administrative rules, regulations, and

16 guidelines and to protect the rights of Petitioner and members of the public with respect to the

17 decisions and actions of Respondents in complying with the requirements of CEQA, the State

18 Planning and Zoning Law, the City's Municipal Code, and the U.S. Constitution and the

19 California Constitution.

20 FACTS COMMON TO ALL CAUSES OF ACTION

21 15. In 2002, the City comprehensively updated its General Plan and certified the Final
22 Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the Hanford 2002 General Plan.

23 16. In 2003, the City approved an amendment of the Hanford 2002 General Plan and

24 approved the Hanford Station and Wal-Mart Supercenter Project and certified a Final EIR for

25 this project.

26 17. On June 1, 2012, pursuant to Government Code section 65040.5, the Director of

27 the Office of Planning and Research sent a letter to the City of Hanford notifying the City that its
28 General Plan had not been revised within the past eight (8) years and of its implied duty to keep

10

its General Plan current [DeVita v. County of Napa, 9 Cal.4th 763 (1995)]. [True copy of letter.
2 marked "Exhibit A" is attached hereto and incorporated herein.]

3 18. In 2013, the City commenced work on the Hanford 2035 General Plan by

4 a conducting a Request for Proposal process to a hire a private consultant to assist City Staff in the

5 preparation of the GPU, and the City ultimately selected and contracted with its planning

6 consultants, QK (formerly known as "QuadKnopf'), Visalia, and local Hanford civil engineer,
7 John Zumwalt (Zumwalt-Hansen Engineers) to provide professional services and initiated the

8 comprehensive review and update of its 2002 General Plan.

9 19. After the consultants had prepared a Background Report, dated March, 2014, and a
10 Draft General Plan Update, a series of meetings of the Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC),
11 appointed by the City Council, was conducted in 2015 over a six-month period, ending in
12 September, 2015, and written recommendations were prepared, under the guidance and direction
13 of the consultants, including John Zumwalt, and forwarded to the City Council and Planning

14 Commission for their review.

15 20. From late 2015 through early 2016, the City Council and Planning Commission
16 held a number of public meetings, including several joint meetings of these bodies, to review and
17 revise the Draft General Plan Update and the Zoning Ordinance; and in late 2016, the Draft GPU
18 was referred to the consultants to prepare a Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR) for the
19 2035 GPU for review and comment by the public.
20 21. On July 29, 2016, the City published notice of the availability of the DEIR for
21 public review and comment, and allowed forty-five (45) days for such comments to be received,

22 no later than September 12, 2016.

23 22. On September 12, 2016, Petitioner timely submitted comments addressing a

24 number of issues. [True copy, marked "Exhibit B," is attached hereto and incorporated by
25 reference herein. Note: the Biological Report prepared by Dr. James Paulus inadvertently
26 omitted photographs, and a complete copy was re-submitted in the record during the final
27 hearings held in April and May, 2017. The article by Richard L. Harriman attached is barely
28

6

1 legible, due to transmission via email, and a clear copy will be provided in the Administrative
2 Record.]

3 23. At the March 14, 2017 hearing before the City Planning Commission, Petitioner's
4 planning consultant, Douglas Mclsaac, and its legal counsel appeared and presented oral
5 testimony concerning the legal inadequacy of the GPU; the Planning Commission approved and

6 recommended certification of the Final EIR, the GPU, and the Zoning Ordinance to the City
7 Council. The vote was 4-0 in favor of recommending certification of the FEIR; 3-1
8| (Commissioner Ham dissenting) in favor of recommending adoption of the GPU; and 3-1
9 (Commissioner Ham dissenting) in favor of recommending adoption of the Zoning Ordinance.
10 Commissioner Shah was absent.

11 24. On March 27, 2017, the City's Director of Community Development emailed
12 notice of the availability of the Final EIR for the GPU and Zoning Ordinance; however, due to
13 delay in transmittal of notice to Petitioner, the hearing set before the City Council on April 4.
14 2017, was opened and continued to April 18, 2017.

15 25. On April 13, 2017, Petitioner submitted written objections and comments to the
16 City Council for consideration at its continued hearing on April 18, 2017. [True copy of letter,
17 dated April 13, 2017, marked "Exhibit C," is attached and incorporated by reference herein.]
18 26. At the April 18, 2017 hearing before the City Council, Petitioner's planning
19 consultant and legal counsel appeared and presented written testimony and oral testimony
20 regarding objections to the legal adequacy of the GPU and the FEIR. [True copy of the written
21 testimony of Mr. McIsaac, dated April 18, 2017, marked "Exhibit D." is D," attached hereto and
22 incorporated by reference herein. A true copy of Mr. Harriman's letter of April 18, 2017,
23 regarding requested Implementation Measures, submitted via email and at the hearing, marked
24 "Exhibit E," is attached hereto and is incorporated by reference herein. ] The public comment
25 portion of the hearing was closed, and the hearing was continued to April 24, 2017 for
26 discussion, deliberation, and action. Council member Sue Sorenson recused herself and did not
27 participate in the deliberations, decisions, or actions of the Council.

28

7

1 27. On April 24, 2017, the Council discussed and deliberated the matters before them.

2 and voted to certify the FEIR (4-0), to adopt the GPU (4-0), and to adopt the Zoning Ordinance

3 (4-0). The Zoning Ordinance was set on the May 2, 2017 Council Agenda for second reading.

4 Council member Sue Sorenson again recused herself and did not participate in the deliberations,

5 decisions, or actions of the Council.

6 28. On April 25, 2017, the City filed its Notice of Determination (NOD) with the

7 Kings County Clerk. [True copy of the file-endorsed NOD, marked "Exhibit F" is attached

8 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.]

9 29. On May 1, 2017, Petitioner's counsel submitted written objections to the adoption

10 of the Proposed Zoning Ordinance to the City Council. [True copy of May 1, 2017 letter from
11 Mr. Harriman, marked "Exhibit G." is attached and incorporate herein by reference.]

12 30. On May 2, 2017, the Council voted to waive the second reading and to adopt the
13 Zoning Ordinance on a 4-0 vote in favor of its decision and action. Council member Sue

14 Sorenson, again, recused herself and did not participate in the deliberations, decisions, or actions

15 of the Council.

16 31. On May 22, 2017, Petitioner served its Notice of Intent to File Suit Stating Claims

17 under the California Environmental Quality Act, pursuant to PRC section 21167.5. [True copy

18 of NOD, marked "Exhibit H," is attached hereto and incorporated by reference herein.]

19 32. On December 19, 2017, the City Council adopted the City of Hanford General
20 Plan Implementation Plan, pursuant to Government Code section 65400(a)(1).
21

22 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

23 [Violations of CEQA]
24 33. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates herein by reference each and every
25 allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 32, inclusive, as though fully set forth herein.
26 34. The grounds for this challenge are that the Respondents City of Hanford and the
27 Hanford City Council have abused their discretion delegated to them under the California
28 Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) [Public Resources Code (PRC) section 21000 et seq-],

8

pursuant to sections 21168 and 21168.5, to the prejudice of Petitioner and the general public, by

2 failing to proceed in a manner required by law, as set forth hereinbelow.

3 A. The FEIR Relies Upon Outdated Information

4 The City was notified by the Governor's Office of Planning and Research (OP&R) on
5 June 1, 2012 that the City's General Plan needed to be updated.

6 As the Staff Report, dated April 4, 2017 states, "The work on the 2035 General Plan

7 Update began in 2013..The 2035 General Plan Background Report was finalized in January

8 2014." [p. 161, Section 13.A.a, "Background Information")]
9 The Staff Report of April 4, 2017 states:

10 "The Housing Element and Air Quality Element were not included as the Housing

11 Element was updated in accordance with State Requirements in 2016 and the Air Quality
12 Element was prepared and adopted in 2010 and was not included in the update." [Page 162,
13 paragraph 2, last sentence. ]

14 The FEIR relied for its Air Quality Analysis on information that is, at least, seven (7)
15 years old, and the FEIR performed no current Air Quality Analysis upon which it relied in its

16 cumulative adverse impacts analysis and in the City's Statement of Overriding Considerations.
17 Finally, the FEIR failed to include or consider the severe drought impacts during the past
18 four years on the groundwater supply upon which the City of Hanford relies for its municipal
19 water supply for both domestic and other commercial and industrial uses.

20 Therefore, the City, acting as the lead agency under CEQA has abused its discretion to
21 the prejudice of Petitioner, its members and supporters, and the general public, by failing to
22 proceed in the manner required by law, pursuant to Public Resources Code sections 21168 and

23 21168.5.

24 B. The Statement of Overriding Considerations Fails to Weigh and Balance 25 The Significant Adverse Effects of the Projects with the Benefits Asserted
26 Although the Statement of Overriding Considerations (SOR) does set forth the significant
27 unavoidable and unmitigable impacts to air quality, it does not quantify the public health and

28 safety impacts to the public, nor does it quantify the benefits from the proposed project, in a

9

A

manner that weighs and balances in a quantitative fashion that relates to the benefits to Air

2 Quality of the GPU project that permits the lead agency to perform the "weighing and balancing"
3 duty enunciated in CEQA Guidelines [California Code of Regulations, Title 14, sections 15091-

4 15094]

5 The basis for this objection is that, while the SOR does a pro forma recitation of the
6 significant unavoidable and unmitigable adverse impacts, it omits the it next logical step in the

7 procedure of identifying the factors it will rely upon to measure, weigh, and balance the

8 vague, general, and conclusory fashion, without a deliberate "benefits," which are stated in a

9 identification and systematically calculated analysis, measurement, and comparison of the

10 benefits with the specific "detrimental" effects caused by the approval of the GPU.

11 Due to this omission in the analysis, reasoning, and comparison of each detriment with
12 cannot and does not demonstrate the specific data or upon each benefit claimed, the lead agency
13 which the lead agency relies on for its ultimate determination and conclusion relied on for each
14 specific adverse impact imposed vs. the benefit gained. In logical context, the lead agency's

15 SOR fails to provide the chain of reasoning from "adverse impact" (detriment) compared with

16 specific "benefit," so that the political accountability of the decision-makers' reasoning and

17 action can be understood and properly evaluated by the public. [No Oil, Inc. V. City of Los

18 Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, cited by Kostka & Zischke, Practice Under the California

19 Environmental Quality Act (Continuing Education of the Bar, Second Edition, 2014, as updated),
20 Volume 1, p. § 1-16, § 1.18]
21 Therefore, this procedural defect in the SOR constitutes an abuse of discretion to the
22 prejudice to Petitioner, its members and supporters, and the general public and is a failure to
23 proceed in the manner required by law, in violation of PRC sections 21168 and 21168.5.

24

25 C. The City Failed to Comply with the Environmental Justice Doctrine By Failing to Provide Adequate Notice, Public Outreach, and Opportunity
26 To be Heard, as Required by CEQA

27 The General Background Report (March 2015), which was prepared in 2013-2014), at

28 page 2-14, states:

10

A

1 "Hispanic origin of any race makes-up 49% of the city's population."

2 The Report also recognizes other ethnic groups, such as Black, Asian, and two-or-more racial

3 background, as well as non-English speaking residents who are Portuguese. The City of Hanford is,

4 certainly, a "diverse" racial and ethnic community.

5 The California Attorney General has published a guidance memorandum, entitled

6 "Environmental Justice at the Local and Regional Level - Legal Background." (July 10, 2012)

7 [Copy attached] The first two paragraphs of this document states:

8 "Cities, counties, and other local governmental entities have an important role
9 to play in ensuring environmental justice for all of California's residents. Under

10 state law:

11 "[E]nvironmental justice" means the fair treatment of people of all races,
12 Cultures, and incomes with respect to the development, adoption, implement-
13 tation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies.

14 (Gov. Code, § 65040.12, subd. (e) Fairness in this context means that the benefits of a
15 healthy environment should be available to everyone, and the burdens of pollution
16 should not be focused on sensitive populations or on communities that are already

17 experiencing its adverse effects."

18 In this guidance from the State of California Department of Justice, the publication notes the

19 potential application to environmental settings and cumulative impacts. Both of these issues are
20 involved in the consideration of the legal adequacy of the proposed FEIR.
21 In addition, SB 1000 [Government Code Section 56302(h)], adopted and signed into law in
22 2016, and becomes effective in 2017, provides direction as to the importance of Environmental
23 Justice to all minority groups in California, whose health, safety, and welfare may be directly or
24 indirectly impacted by land use decisions, particularly from General Plans (especially, Land Use
25 Elements). Essential to the statutorily recognized Doctrine of Environmental Justice is the due

26 process concept of fairness, which involves reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard.
27 Petitioner has not been able to locate any notices in the record of proceedings published or
28 circulated in Spanish, Portuguese, or Asian publications or copies of materials in any language, other

11

1 than English. Petitioner's representative was unable to locate copies of complete documents, such as
2 the FEIR or the GPU, I was unable to locate them at the Kings County Library in Hanford, when I
3 last checked on the morning of April 5, 2017. [Source, Sherman Lee, Reference Librarian, Kings

4 County Library, Hanford.]

5 Petitioner's representatives do not recall having seen any Spanish or other language

6 interpreters at public meetings; nor have we seen any written summaries in Spanish, Portuguese, or
7 Asian languages in the record. Similarly, there has been no analysis memorialized in writing

8 contained in the record which sets forth when or how the lead agency analyzed its duty of outreach to
9 the minority and disadvantaged communities within the City of Hanford. The City failed to

10 implement the principles of environmental justice in their analysis and reasoning in the Statement of
11 Overriding Considerations, especially, with respect to environmental setting and cumulative impacts
12 analysis of air quality impacts.

13 The OP&R General Plan Guidelines, at pp. 22- 23 cite specific prohibitions against precisely
14 the unfair processes engaged in by the City in its GPU process. Specifically, the lack of outreach
15 and/or meetings in local minority or underserved communities and failure to have language
16 accommodation (both written and oral) throughout the 4-year process. [See, pp. 22-23 and pp. 142-

17 148, regarding methodologies to increase participation.]

18 Petitioner contends that the lead agency has not complied with the principles of the

19 Environmental Justice and that these matters should be remanded to City Staff to engage in a
20 concerted effort to comply with the provisions of state law set forth by the Attorney General,
21 especially with respect to outreach and consideration of disproportionate impacts on members of
22 minority communities within the City.

23 The failure of the lead agency to comply with the foregoing requirements constitutes an
24 abuse of discretion to the prejudice to Petitioner, its members and supporters, and the general
25 public and is a failure to proceed in the manner required by law, in violation of PRC sections
26 21168 and 21168.5.

27 D. The Analysis of Open Space and Adverse Impacts to Open Space is Inadequate
28

12

1 There are a number of deficiencies in the Open Space Element that cause the FEIR to be
2 legally deficient, pursuant to Government Code section 65302(e).

3 Specifically, the Open Space Element incorporates by reference Government Code

4 section 65560 et seq. Section 65560 provides, in relevant part:

5

6 "(b) "Open-space land" is any parcel or area of land or water that is essentially unimproved and devoted to an open-space use as defined
7 in this section, and that is designated on a local, regional, or

8 state open-space plan as any of the following: (1) Open space for the preservation of natural resources
9 including, but not limited to, areas required for the preservation of
plant and animal life, including habitat for fish and wildlife
10 species; areas required for ecologic and other scientific study
11 purposes; rivers, streams, bays, and estuaries; and coastal beaches, lakeshores, banks of rivers and streams, greenways, as defined in
12 Section 816.52 of the Civil Code, and watershed lands.

13

14 (3) Open space for outdoor recreation, including, but not limited
15 to, areas of outstanding scenic, historic, and cultural value; areas

16 particularly suited for park and recreation purposes, including access to lakeshores, beaches, and rivers and streams; and areas that
17 serve as links between major recreation and open-space reservations, including utility easements, banks of rivers and streams, trails,
18 greenways, and scenic highway corridors." (emphasis added)

19 In addition, Government Code section 65561 provides in relevant part:
20

21 "The Legislature finds and declares as follows:
(a) That the preservation of open-space land, as defined in this
22 article, is necessary not only for the maintenance of the economy of the state, but also for the assurance of the continued availability
23 of land for the production of food and fiber, for the enjoyment of

24 scenic beauty, for recreation and for the use of natural resources."
(emphasis added)
25

26 In the DEIR, under Section 1.3.2, "Local Setting," the City's EIR preparer states:

27 "The only natural watercourse found near the City is Mussel Slough, remnants of which

28 still exist on the City's western edge. " [p. 1-5, middle paragraph, lines 3-20]

13

1 Petitioner contends that the both the GPU and the FEIR fail to comply with the foregoing
2 statutory mandate, due to the fact that the there is no specific and definite identification,

3 recognition, and permanent protection of the historic Mussel Slough located within the Study

4 Area. In fact, although the DEIR cites the Live Oak Master Plan on the west side of Twelfth

5 Avenue, south of SR 198, as follows:

6 "a single-family residential project that includes park facilities and open space on 390
7 acres. Located in the southeastern portion of the city, the site is bounded on the north by

8 Hume Avenue, on the south by Houston Avenue, and on the east by Lone Oak Slough.
9 Single-family lot sizes are planned to range from 3,200 square feet to 12,000 square feet.
10 The single-family residential design includes small lot alley-accessed housing. The larger
11 lots will retain conventional vehicle access. Twenty-one acres of parkland and 31.6
12 acres of open space/conservation land use will be linked together via a system of a
13 connected linear parks and pedestrian trails. The project is expected to take 5 to 5 10
14 years to fully build-out in six phases. The plans were approved in 2007 and some

15 construction has begun." (emphasis added) [p.. 3-33 & 23]
16 Despite the fact that the Live Oak Master Plan was approved by the City nine (9) years
17 ago, the lead agency has failed to recognize the precedent for permanent preservation and
18 protection of natural water courses, such as Lone Oak Slough and, by implication, the historic
19 Mussel Slough. The protection and preservation of the Mussel Slough was specifically raised by
20 Petitioner's counsel and Robin Mattos during the Citizen Advisory Committee meetings and at
21 the Scopit Scoping Session held on April 22, 2015. [See Meeting Notes attached to the NOP, DEIR,
22 Vol. 2, Appendix A.]

23

24 E. The City's General Plan Implementation Plan, Required by Government Code Section 65400(a)(1), is legally inadequate 25 The GPU and the FEIR, along with the Implementation fail to include the specific
26 implementation measures and/or Mitigation Measures necessary to preserve and protect the
27 remaining portions of the Mussel Slough, including the North Mussel Slough drainage basin,
28 north of Grangeville Road and the westerly "remnant" of the Mussel Slough which extends from

14

1 the South Mussel Slough Remnant Drainage Basin onto the property owned by the Karyan

2 Family Trust and other property owners to the west of 12 ½ Avenue.
3 Petitioner also raised the issue that, in the City's Memorandum of Understanding of
4 December 20, 2007 with the Hanford Environmental Awareness Team, the City agreed to the

5 following provision:

6 "6. In its consideration of applications for future development within the Project Area,

7 the City shall consider the Winterburg borrow pit in its alternative site analysis and

8 cumulative impacts analysis for the location of storm drainage basins in the

9 environmental review of any and all proposed project developments proposed in the
10 Project Area."

11 The "Project Area" included all of Reorganization No. 142, west of Centennial Drive,
12 west of the Super Target and Super Wal-Mart Shopping Centers, north of the San Joaquin
13 Railroad (SJVR), east of Avenue 13, and south of W. Lacey. This area is included in the

14 proposed 2035 General Plan. This area still contains Mussel Slough remnants and other natural

15 water courses and irrigation ditches and does not contain any publicly developed parks or Open
16 Space, other than the South Mussel Slough Remnant Drainage Basin immediately to the west of
17 the Super Wal-Mart Shopping Center.

18 Similarly, the 2035 GPU and its FEIR do not adequately address the potentially

19 significant adverse environmental impacts from re-zoning the westernmost 18 acres of open
20 space in Hidden Valley Park (HVP) to residential land use (R1-5), specifically, the adverse
21 impacts of converting the remaining portion of the HVP, which was preserved for public use as a
22 public park, along with the scenic views of the open space in the North Mussel Slough Remnant
23 Drainage Basin for public use and enjoyment and as an open space easement for the home
24 owners who purchased the developed subdivided lots and homes on the north side of Cortner

25 Street.

26 Finally, the City's 2035 GPU did not include an Implementation Plan for the
27 identification and designation of implementation measures to implement the Goals, Objectives,

28 and Policies of the 2035 GPU. Likewise, the General Plan Implementation Plan that was

15

1 adopted on December 19, 2017, after this legal action was filed, does not contain specific

2 programs, projects, or actions with specific times designated for their commencement or

3 completion. Therefore, the GPU and the EIR are legally inadequate, and will remain so, unless

4 and until the Implementation Plan has been prepared, considered, and approved as required by

5 the provisions of the Open Space Element (Govt. Code sections 65302(e) and 65560 et seq.) and

6 the provisions of Govt. Code section 65400(a)(1).

7

8 F. The Cumulative Impacts Section Regarding Biological Resources in Section 5.4.4 of the DEIR is Inadequate

9 The Cumulative Impacts Section of the FEIR, Section 5.4.4, at p. 5-5, is legally

10 inadequate because it fails to make a good faith effort to disclose, analyze, and consider the

11 cumulative adverse impacts to the biological resources of the Mussel Slough which have been

12 filled and destroyed over the past fifty (50) years by developments approved by the City of
13 Hanford and its Staff, including, without limitation, its contract engineering firm, Zumwalt-

14 Hansen (John Zumwalt), acting on behalf of, and in concert with, private developers seeking

15 development permits in and immediately adjacent to the historic Mussel Slough.

16 In 2007, during to the litigation between HEAT and the City of Hanford, relating to the

17 development of the Lowe's Project by a client of Mr. Zumwalt, Petitioner's counsel retained a

18 professional biological consultant to prepare a study on the biological resource values of the

19 Mussel Slough at that time. [See, the study by Jim Paulus, Ph.D., entitled "Mussel Slough

20 Segments: Origins and Trends 1954 - Present," August 16, 2007, attached in "Exhibit B"]

21 Based on the findings of Dr. Paulus, the cumulative adverse impacts on the riparian

22 biological resources by the pattern and practice of filling in serial segments of the Mussel Slough

23 have resulted in continued cumulative damage to this natural water course, Mussel Slough.

24 In addition, the original Land Use Map for the Draft GPU, when it was originally

25 considered by the Citizens Advisory Committee, in 2015, showed the Mussel Slough "remnant"

26 connected to the Open Space identified for the proposed Open Space/Park in the area which was

27 annexed into the City in 2007 as Reorganization 142. The GPU and FEIR were approved and

28 adopted, showing a disconnected Open Space/Park location on the LU Map.

16

1 Finally, neither the FEIR nor the GPU includes specific implementation measures nor

2 mitigation measures which implement the preservation and protection of the historic Mussel

3 Slough natural watercourse. Likewise, there are no mitigation measures identified or provided to

4 provide restoration of the Mussel Slough nor do these documents provide for permanent

5 preservation of other areas of the Mussel Slough channel or for the portion of the Hidden Valley

6 Park which the City has proposed to sell for residential development.

7 Therefore, both the FEIR and the GPU are legally inadequate, because the lead agency

8 has failed to disclose, analyze, or consider the City's intent and previous efforts to convert a

9 portion of the Open Space described in the FEIR section on Recreation and Parks; to-wit: the

10 undeveloped western half of Hidden Valley Park, adjacent to the North Mussel Slough drainage
11 basin located on the west side of Hidden Valley Park, and to interconnect the other parks and
12 undeveloped open space throughout the City, as originally intended and designated in the City's
13 1972 General Plan.

14

15 G. The FEIR is Inadequate Based on the Failure to Consider an Alternative Mitigation Measure to Conserve Treated Effluent
16 The FEIR (and the GPU) emphasize that the sole source of the City's municipal and
17 Industrial water supply is groundwater. There is discussion in the EIR that the preferred
18 alternative for the disposal of the treated urban wastewater is to provide it free of charge to
19 agricultural users. Neither the FEIR, nor the GPU, discusses the other statutorily mandated
20 alternative---specially, the reuse of treated urban wastewater by the population that uses the
21 potable water and pays for its treatment (the residents of Hanford) for non-potable uses, such as
22 irrigation of public and private landscaping, as well as other non-potable uses.
23 Nowhere in the FEIR or the GPU is there a reference to the mandate of Water Code
24 section 13350 et seq. that the reuse of treated urban wastewater is defined as a "beneficial use"
25 and was mandated in the 2009 legislation adopted and codified in these sections.
26 Further, Petitioner 's counsel included a copy of a recent article entitled, "Urban Water
27 Conservation: Another Alternative," which appeared in the August 6, 2016 edition of the Valley
28 Voice. This article supports the use of recycled urban effluent for non-potable uses within the

17

P City limits, as a means a of conserving and reusing treated effluent, rather than transporting it off-
2 site---thereby resulting in more potable water being used for non-potable uses in the developed
3 City limits.

4 Therefore, by failing to adequately address this alternative, Respondents have abused

5 their discretion to the prejudice of Petitioner, its members and supporters, and the general public

6 in the City of Hanford and has failed to proceed in the manner required by law, pursuant to PRC
7 sections 21168 and 21168.5 and CEQA Guidelines section 15126.6.

8 35. Wherefore, Petitioner requests the Court to issue a writ of mandate commanding,
9 directing, and ordering the Hanford City Council to vacate and set aside its decisions and actions
10 adopting and certifying the FEIR, based in its abuse of discretion by failing to proceed in the
11 manner required by law, as set forth above, pursuant to Pub. Res. Code sections 21168 and

12 21168.5 and that the Court issue an administrative stay on granting any and all general plan

13 amendments, re-zonings, and/or other permits or entitlements which require findings of
14 consistency with the General Plan.

15 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

16 [Violations of State Planning and Zoning Law]
17 36. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates herein by reference each and every

18 allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 35, inclusive, as though fully set forth herein.

19 37. The grounds for this challenge are that the Respondents City of Hanford and the
20 Hanford City Council have abused their discretion delegated to them under the State Planning

21 and Zoning Law [Government Code (GC) section 65300 et seq-] to the prejudice of Petitioner, its

22 members and supporters, and the general public of the City of Hanford, by failing to proceed in a

23 manner required by law, as set forth hereinbelow.

24 A. The Circulation Element is Inadequate
25 California Government Code section 65302, subd. (b) provides the City's General Plan
26 shall include:
27 "b) (1) A circulation element consisting of the general location
28 and extent of existing and proposed major thoroughfares,

18

-'

2 transportation routes, terminals, any military airports and ports,
and other local public utilities and facilities, all correlated with
the land use element of the plan" (emphasis added)

4 Petitioner was unable to locate text, map,

5 or other diagram in the 2035 General Plan

6 (or the FEIR) which complies with the above-reference requirement.

7 Therefore, the Court should order the Respondents to vacate, set aside, and void its

8 approval and adoption of the 2035 General Plan and to comply with this provision.

9 B. The Safety Element and DEIR are Inadequate

10 California Government Code section 65302, subd. (g) provides the City's General Plan

11 shall include a Safety Element, defined as follows:

12

13 "(g) (1) A safety element for the protection of the community from any unreasonable risks associated with the effects of seismically

14 induced surface rupture, ground shaking, ground failure, tsunami, seiche, and dam failure; slope instability leading to mudslides and

15 landslides; subsidence; liquefaction; and other seismic hazards

16 identified pursuant to Chapter 7.8 (commencing with Section 2690) of Division 2 of the Public Resources Code, and other geologic hazards

17 known to the legislative body; flooding; and wildland and urban

18 fires. The safety element shall include mapping of known seismic and other geologic hazards. It shall also address evacuation routes,

19 military installations, peakload water supply requirements, and minimum road widths and clearances around structures, as those items

20 relate to identified fire and geologic hazards." (emphasis added)

21

22 This commentator was unable to locate text, map, or other diagram in the Draft General

23 Plan or the DEIR which complies with the above-reference requirement. Both documents should

24 be revised and amended to comply with this provision. Specifically, the Seismic Element fails to

25 include the text and mapping for the sandy soils located in the area of streambeds and braided

26 streams which are subject to subsidence and liquefaction in the sandy areas (such as those

27 adjacent to or near Mussel Slough), and which are significant for construction of multi-story

28 buildings. Evidence of this fact has appeared in the local press, concerning sudden subsidence
and sink holes in the local area in and around the City of Hanford.

19

-

1 Therefore, the Court should order the Respondents to vacate, set aside, and void its

2 approval and adoption of the 2035 General Plan and to comply with this provision.

3 C. The Open Space Element and GP FEIR are Inadequate
4 As set forth above in paragraph 34. D., there are a number of deficiencies in the Open
5 Space Element that are reflected in the DEIR. (Government Code section 65302(e)
6 Specifically, the Open Space Element incorporates by reference Government Code
7 section 65560 et seq. Section 65560 provides, in relevant part:
8

9 "(b) "Open-space land" is any parcel or area of land or water that

10 is essentially unimproved and devoted to an open-space use as defined in this section, and that is a designated on a local, regional, or
11 state open-space plan as any of the following: (1) Open space for the preservation of natural resources 12 including, but not limited to, areas required for the preservation of
13 plant and animal life, including habitat for fish and wildlife
species; areas required for ecologic and other scientific study
14 purposes; rivers, streams, bays, and estuaries; and coastal beaches, lakeshores, banks of rivers and streams, greenways, as defined in 15 Section 816.52 of the Civil Code, and watershed lands.
16

17

18 (3) Open space for outdoor recreation, including, but not limited
to, areas of outstanding scenic, historic, and cultural value; areas
19 particularly suited for park and recreation purposes, including
access to lakeshores, beaches, and rivers and streams; and areas that 20 serve as links between major recreation and open-space reservations,
21 including utility easements, banks of rivers and streams, trails, greenways, and scenic highway corridors." (emphasis added)
22

23 In addition, Government Code section 65561 provides in relevant part:

24 "The Legislature finds and declares as follows:
(a) That the preservation of open-space land, as defined in this 25 article, is necessary not only for the maintenance of the economy of
26 the state, but also for the assurance of the continued availability of land for the production of food and fiber, for the enjoyment of
27 scenic beauty, for recreation and for the use of natural resources."
(emphasis added) 28

20

In the EIR, under Section 1.3.2, "Local Setting," the City's EIR preparer states:

2 "The only natural watercourse found near the City is Mussel Slough, remnants of which

3 still exist on the City's western edge. " [p. 1-5, middle paragraph, lines 3-20]

4 Petitioner contends that the General Plan Update (and the DEIR) fail to comply

5 with the foregoing statutory mandate, due to the fact that the there is no specific and definite

6 identification, recognition, and permanent protection of the historic Mussel Slough located

7 within the Study Area. In fact, the EIR cites the Live Oak Master Plan on the west side of

8 Twelfth Avenue, south of SR 198, as follows:

9 "a single-family residential project that includes park facilities and open space on 390

10 acres. Located in the southeastern portion of the city, the site is bounded on the north by

11 Hume Avenue, on the south by Houston Avenue, and on the east by Lone Oak Slough.

12 Single-family lot sizes are planned to range from 3,200 square feet to 12,000 square feet.

13 The single-family residential design includes small lot alley-accessed housing. The larger

14 lots will retain conventional vehicle access. Twenty-one acres of parkland and 31.6 acres

15 of open space/conservation land use will be linked together via system of connected

16 linear parks and pedestrian trails. The project is expected to take 5 to 10 years to fully

17 build-out in six phases. The plans were approved in 2007 and some construction has

18 begun." (emphasis added) [p.. 3-33 & 23]

19 Despite the fact that the Live Oak Master Plan was approved by the City nine (9) years

20 ago, the lead agency has failed to recognize the precedent for permanent preservation and

21 protection of natural water courses, such as Lone Oak Slough and, by implication, the historic

22 Mussel Slough, People's Ditch, and Last Chance Ditch, all of which were, and still are,

23 developed in the natural watercourses that evolved from the historic wetlands on the west side of

24 the City. [See Paulus Report in "Exhibit B', attached; the complete report with photographs

25 included was introduced into the record during the hearings referred to above.]

26 The protection and preservation of the Mussel Slough was specifically raised by

27 Petitioner and Robin Mattos during the Citizen Advisory Committee meetings and at the Scoping

28

21

1 Session held on April 22, 2015. [See Meeting Notes attached to the NOP, DEIR, Vol. 2,

2 Appendix A.]

3 Further, the GPU (and the DEIR) have failed to include the specific implementation

4 measures and/or Mitigation Measures necessary to preserve and protect the remaining portions of
5 the Mussel Slough and its westerly "remnant" which extends from the Mussel Slough Remnant

6 Drainage Basin onto the property owned by the Karyan Family Trust and other property owners

7 to the west of 12 ½ Avenue, who were named in the pending lawsuit in Kings County Superior

8 Court (Case No. 16C-0208), which has been served on the City of Hanford. [Pursuant to

9 Evidence Code section 452, subd. (d), Petitioner requests that the Court take judicial notice of

10 the Second Amended Petition filed in that case, a copy of which was introduced into the record
11 of proceedings prior to the final public hearings in this matter.

12 Therefore, the Court should order the Respondents to vacate, set aside, and void its

13 approval and adoption of the 2035 General Plan and to comply with this provision.

14

15 D. The GPU is Inadequate Due to the Lack of A Definite Time Stated for the

16 Completion of the Storm Drainage Master Plan Water Management Plan

17 and Water System Master Plan and Due to the Failure To Use the 2015

18 Urban Water Management Plan .

19 The GPU (and the FEIR) refer to a number of plans that the lead agency intends to update

20 at some indefinite time in the future. There is no legal or other authority cited for the failure to

21 l have updated the plans prior to the adoption of the GPU or its EIR.

22 Specifically, the EIR states:

23 "The City of Hanford Storm Drainage Master Plan (City of Hanford 1995a) was

24 prepared to develop innovative and creative means to provide effective and cost-efficientl

25 storm drainage planning to the City. The Master Plan discusses plans, development, and

26 financing for the required storm drainage facilities that can be accomplished in a timely

27 and cost-effective manner. The City's principal goals consisted of the identification of

28

22

oOUAWN current (and future) capacity deficiencies in the existing storm drainage system and
recommendations for system improvements to serve current and projected land uses.
The City is currently in the process of updating its Storm Drainage Master Plan. The
General Plan Update and this EIR will be used to update this plan based on the preferred
land uses." [p. 3-21]
Similarly, the DEIR cites the following:
"WATER SYSTEM MASTER PLAN

9 The City of Hanford Water System Master Plan (City of Hanford 1996) provided the City

10 with a tool for planning its water supply and distribution. The City is currently in the

11 process of updating its Water System Master Plan. The General Plan Update and this

12 EIR will be used to update this plan based on the preferred land uses." [p. 3-22]

13 Finally, the GPU and the DEIR cite the City's 2010 Urban Water Master Plan

14 (UWMP), rather than the 2015 Urban Water Master Plan, which was adopted in July, 2016.

15 There is no reason provided for the use of the outdated 2010 UWMP, especially, given the five

16 year drought which occurred after the preparation of the 2010 UWMP. The GPU should not be

17 approved without the completion of the Water System Master Plan, irrespective of whether the

18 City has relied on either the 2010 or 2015 UWMP. The fact that the City is "currently in the

19 process of updating its Water System Master Plan" or not, the GPU cannot properly rely upon a

20 Water System Master Plan that has not already been completed and adopted to support its GPU.

21 Therefore, the Court should order the Respondents to vacate, set aside, and void its

22 approval and adoption of the 2035 General Plan unless and until the City has adopted its Water
System Master Plan.

23

24 E. The GPU is Legally Inadequate Due to the Failure to Include Implementation
Measures for All Policies.

25

26 The City Staff and its consultants have been working on the GPU and its supporting

27 documents since 2013. The City Staff and its consultants have had over four (4) years within

28 which to prepare implementation measures, as noted in in the OP&R General Plan Guidelines

23

read into the record by my clients' consultant, Douglas McIsaac. [General Plan Guidelines, at pp.

2 22-23 at the Council hearing on April 18, 2017.

3 Mr. McIsaac has been a practicing planner and, most recently, the Director of

4 Community Development and Planning for the City of Bakersfield. Specifically, Mr. McIsaac

5 opined that the State's General Plan Guidelines and planning principles require an

6 implementation measure for each policy adopted in the City's General Plan. In addition, Mr.

7 Mclsaac testified that the General Plan should avoid using vague, uncertain, and imprecise

8 language in the General Plan implementation measures. [The same is true for the Mitigation
9 Measures in the FEIR and in the General Plan Implementation Plan adopted on December 19,

10 2017.1

11 There are no specifically worded implementation measures identified for the
12 identification, protection, and preservation of the natural watercourses remaining in the City
13 Study area, as defined in the proposed GPU.

14 Therefore, the GPU must be remanded to Staff and their consultants to prepare

15 specifically identified and time-designated Implementation Measures for each Goal, Objective,

16 and Policy in the GPU to be included in a revised GPU for circulation, review, and comments by

17 the general public, prior to bringing the revised GPU back to the Council for its review and

18 approval.

19 Petitioner submitted a professional biologist's report in support of their comments and

20 objections that the existing 2002 General Plan has not provided adequate protection and
21 preservation of the limited Endangered, Threatened, and Rare species of animals and plants and
22 Species of Special Concern on the west side of Hanford and associated with the Mussel Slough.

23 (James Paulus, PhD. 2007) Apparently, the photographs included and referred to in Dr. Paulus's

24 report were not received and/or included in our comments on the Draft EIR. A complete report
25 for your reference will be requested for inclusion in the record of proceedings.

26 Based on Mr. McIssac's presentation to the Council, Petitioner contends that the

27 Biological Portion of the General Plan (p. 84 et seq.) and the Conservation and Open Space
28 Elements must be amended to include specific Implementation Measures designating what

24

actions will be undertaken to mitigate the adverse impacts to the remaining biological resources

2 associated with the Conservation and Open Space resources that the City intends to preserve and

3 protect within the Study Area designated by the GPU documents, including, without limitation,
4 what restoration measures and actions the City intends to undertake to conserve the remaining

5 undeveloped OS resources and biological resources associated with them.

6 The failure of Respondents to proceed in the manner required by law constitutes an abuse

7 of discretion prejudicial to Petitioner, its members and supporters, and the general public of the

8 City of Hanford and violates Govt. Code sections 65300, 65300.5 and 65302.

9 Therefore, the Court should order the Respondents to vacate, set aside, and void its

10 approval and adoption of the 2035 General Plan unless and until the City has prepared

11 Implementation Measures for each policy in the GPU and the Implementation Measures have

12 been made available to the public for review and heard and adopted by the City Council.

13 F. The Proposed General Plan Violates the Equal Status Among Elements Doctrine
14 The GPU's failure to treat all elements of the General Plan equally violates the Equal
15 Status Among Elements Doctrine. This doctrine is set forth in the OP&R General Plan

16 Guidelines, as follows:

17 "All elements of the general plan have equal legal status. For example, the

18 land use element policies are not superior to the policies of the open-space
19 element. (citing Sierra Club v. Board of Supervisors of Kern County (1981)
20 126 Cal.App.3d 698)"

21 [General Plan Guidelines, p. 12]

22 The basis of this contention is highlighted by the testimony of Mr. Mclsaac, in that
23 without specific Implementation Measures in the GPU and precise language that is susceptible of
24 specific enforcement, the Land Use Element is de facto elevated above the Conservation and

25 Open Space Elements. Similarly, the FEIR is no source of protection of undeveloped open
26 space, natural water courses, or riparian resources without robust Mitigation Measures that are

27 enforceable, due to the wholesale surrender of almost all undeveloped natural resources through
28 the Findings of Overriding Significance, which is challenged hereinabove, and due to the

25

1 complete lack of an updated Action Plan to conserve and protect what little undeveloped Open

2 Space land remains within the City limits.

3 Another deficiency in the GPU is the lack of a completed and implemented Master

4 Bicycle Plan, which appears in the GPU, but has not been implemented yet. With respect to the

5 quadrant of the City defined by W. Lacey Boulevard on the north, Twelfth Avenue on the east,

6 the San Joaquin Valley Railroad (SJVR) on the south, and Thirteenth Avenue on the west, there

7 is no park site, safe route to school, or pedestrian or bicycle trail identified on the Land Use and

8 Circulation Map, nor are there identified bicycle routes from the intersection of Front Street and
9 Thirteenth Street on the south side of W. Lacey Boulevard to Centennial Drive nor north of the

10 SJVR.

11 This fact is of great importance to the GPU's reliance on a multi-modal transportation a

12 plan that expressly includes non-automotive means of transportation, and to the residents of

13 Hanford, due to the lack of safe access to the area described as Open Space west of the Super

14 Wai-Mart Shopping Center , including the Mussel Slough drainage basin and the Open Space

15 which extends to the west of the drainage basin to Thirteenth Avenue.

16 Also, it is extremely to residents of the City of Hanford that there are no sidewalks on

17 Thirteenth Avenue from the intersection with Front Street or on the south side of W. Lacey

18 Boulevard east to Centennial. This demonstrates the lack of concern for the equality of
19 maintaining access to the undeveloped Open Space and safe routes to school and to the W. Lacey
20 Boulevard and Twelfth Avenue mega-shopping center that are auto-centric and not planned for

21 inter-modal 21st century pedestrian and bicycle transportation. The City states it is promoting

22 and relying such multi-modal pedestrian and bicyclist travel to avoid or reduce or mitigate

23 additional air pollution impacts in its Findings of Overriding Consideration for the significant,

24 unavoidable, and unmitigable air quality impacts, which are acknowledged as being significant

25 in the EIR and the Findings of Overriding Consideration.

26 Thus, Petitioner submits that the inequality of the Land Use, Conservation, Open Space,

27 and Air Quality Elements is evident. Petitioner contends that the inequal treatment of these

28

26

-

2 elements constitutes a violation of GC sections 65300.5 and the doctrine of equal dignity
applicable to all elements of the GPU.

3

4 Petitioner contends that the City Council must amend the Master Bicycle and Trails Plan

5 to provide for inter-connection to all developed parks and undeveloped open space.

6 Both the General Plan Background Report [p. 4-16] and the General Plan Circulation

7 Map [p.64] show the proposed pedestrian and bicycle trail maps.

8 Transportation Element Policies PT65 and PT70 are set forth in the proposed General
Plan, as follow:

9

10 "Policy T65 Bicycle Network

11

12 Prioritize the elimination of gaps in the bicycle network to connect destinations across Hanford."

13 "Policy T70 Pedestrian Connections

14

15 Increase connectivity through direct and safe pedestrian connections to public amenities,
neighborhoods, village centers and other destinations throughout the city.'

16 Neither policy includes an Implementation Measure to provide for specific action within a

17 specific time period. Therefore, Petitioner submits that the following specific Implementation

18 Measure for both policies should be adopted, as follows:

19

20 "The City Council shall amend the General Plan to include the following Implementation
Measure for PT 65 and PT 70:

21

22 The General Plan Transportation Element shall be amended to provide that the Master Bicycle and Trails Plan shall include interconnection between all developed parks and all undeveloped

23 open space to provide public access to developed open space and undeveloped open space
during all daytime hours for pedestrians and bicyclists.

24

25 This amendment of the General Plan shall, specifically, provide for pedestrian and bicyclist access from Centennial Drive and Millennial Drive to the north side of the Mussel Slough

26 located to the west of the Super Wal-Mart Shopping Center and continuing to the north of the

27 Winterburg borrow pit and west of 12 ½ Avenue to connect with the pedestrian-bicyclist trail which ends at Thirteenth Avenue and Front Street; and shall be completed within one year of the date of the final adoption of the GPU.

28

27

- In addition, the City's Master Bicycle Master Plan and Trail Plan shall includes a pedestrian and bicyclist trail around the Mussel Slough Basin to the western half of Hidden Valley Park, which
2 shall be developed into a public park or recreation area within one year of the date of the final
adoption of the GPU. 3 The failure of Respondents to proceed in the manner required by law constitutes an abuse 4 of discretion prejudicial to Petitioner, its members and supporters, and the general public of the
5 City of Hanford and violates Govt. Code sections 65300, 65300.5 and 65302.
6 Wherefore, the Court should issue its Order the Respondents to vacate, set aside, and 7 void its approval and adoption of the 2035 General Plan unless and until the City has prepared 8 Implementation Measures for the implementation of the Master Bicycle Plan, including the area
9 of Reorganization 142 and these Implementation Measures have been made available to the 10 public for review and heard and adopted by the City Council.
11

12
THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
13
[Zoning Ordinance Defects]
14
38. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates herein by reference each and every 15 allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 37, inclusive, as though fully set forth herein. 16
39. As set forth in Petitioner's letter of May 1, 2017, the Zoning Ordinance finally 17 adopted by the City Council on May 2, 2017 was defective for the following reasons, which were 18 set forth in the May 2, 2017 letter. ['Exhibit G" attached hereto and incorporated by reference
19 herein.
20

21 40. The City Council erred when it made the finding that the Zoning Ordinance is

22 consistent with the General Plan due to the fact that the General Plan is legally inadequate.

23 41. On page 2 of the proposed Zoning Ordinance, Section 17.02.060, the document

24 accurately states that the Zoning Ordinance must be consistent with the City General Plan.

25 42. In Resolution 17-04, Section 4, the document states:

26 "The City Council hereby finds that Municipal Code Amendment 2017-01, the

27 Zoning Ordinance Update and Zoning M are consistent with the Hanford General

28 Plan, as amended by Resolution 17-21-R."

28

-

2 43. Petitioner objected through its counsel to this finding on the grounds that the City

3 could not rely upon its legally inadequate General Plan 2035, adopted by Resolution 17-21-R,

4 based on the reasons set forth in their letter of May 1, which incorporated the objections set forth

5 hereinabove, which were presented in writing to the City Council prior to its approval of the
General Plan and the Final EIR for the General Plan.

6

7 44. Petitioner objected that the City could not rely upon the new General Plan due to the

8 complete absence of Implementation Measures in the General Plan; specifically, in the

9 Conservation and Open Space Elements, which require an Open Space Action Plan.

10 45. Therefore, the Court should stay the approval of any permits and/or other

11 development entitlements until the Municipal Code Amendment 2017-01has been revised,

12 amended and found to be consistent with a legally adequate General Plan, as set forth above, and

13 on the following grounds, regarding the revision of the Zoning Ordinance.

14

15 A. Section 17.70.080 Improperly Denies the Public of Notice of Potentially Significant Adverse Environmental Impacts under CEQA

16 46. At page 208, Section 17.70.070, in Table 17.70.070, the proposed Zoning Ordinance

17 lists all Site Plan Review Permit applications as subject to "Non-Discretionary Applications."

18 [Municipal Code Amendment 2017-01]

19 47. Section 17.22 is identified in the Zoning Ordinance as controlling all Site Plan

20 Review Permits. [Zoning Ordinance, at p. 214].
48.
21 At page 209, Section 17.70.080 of the Zoning Ordinance states:

22 "...All non-discretionary applications are deemed to not be subject to environmental

23 review, pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15268."

49.
24 a As a result, irrespective of the size of the project or other environmental factors

25 which may be unique, due to the environmental setting or background and other physical

26 characteristics of the project, there is no environmental review and no notice to the public,

27 regarding the project or its potentially significant environmental impacts or effects.

50.
28 Therefore, Petitioner alleges that the language of Section 17.70.080 of the Zoning
Ordinance and the "Site plan contents" set forth in Section 17.72.040 [pp. 215-216], are

29

1 overbroad on the ground that the items listed are insufficient and insufficiently specific to

2 support legal characterization of "non-discretionary" as to all of the elements set forth and

3 required.

4 51. In addition, Petitioner alleges that this section violates the public's right to be

5 provided notice and a reasonable opportunity to be heard and present evidence to the Site Plan

6 Review Committee described in Section 17.72.030, because there is no notice whatsoever given

7 to the public of the Site Plan Review hearings or decisions by the Director or the Site Plan

8 Review Committee. Consequently, the Site Plan Review process is fundamentally flawed and
9 violates CEQA's provisions which define "failure to proceed in the manner required by law" and

10 "abuse of discretion," pursuant to Public Resource Code sections 21168 and 21168.5 and

11 violates Article 1, section 7(a) the California Constitution and the Fifth and Fourteenth

12 I Amendments to the U.S. Constitution on the grounds that the section violates the Due Process

13 clause and the Equal Protection Clause of both the California Constitution and the U.S.

14 Constitution.

15 52. Petitioner alleges that the analysis of whether an administrative decision and action

16 are discretionary depends upon and varies according to a number of factors which are not

17 accounted for or addressed in Section 17.72.040. [See, Sierra Club v. County of Sonoma

18 (Ohlson), filed April 21, 2017, in the First District Court of Appeal.and other cases cited therein.]

19 In that case, the Court held against the Sierra Club, but thoroughly analyzes different cases and

20 factors to be considered, in order to determine whether an administrative decision and action are

21 discretionary.

22 53. Petitioner alleges that the City's desire to declare all Site Plan Review decisions as
23 "discretionary" does not end the inquiry. There may be, and usually are, other factors which are

24 applicable, but may not be raised, due to the fact that the City, acting as the lead agency under

25 CEQA, is not required to provide notice or disclosure to the public of the environmental issues

26 that may arise, depending on the circumstances of the individual project. [See, also, Kings

27 County Farm Bureau, V. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692]

28

30

] 54. In Kings County Farm Bureau, supra, a coal-fired power generation plant was

2 reviewed under a site plan review, and the Court held that the site plan review triggered an

3 environmental review that resulted in an EIR being prepared and challenged. Petitioner alleges

4 that other environmentally sensitive settings along Mussel Slough will require an environmental

5 review document other than a Categorical Exemption. [See the file-marked copy of the

6 Amended Petition and Complaint filed in the related case entitled Hanford Environmental

7 Awareness Team, et al. v. City of Hanford re Bajun American Properties, LP, et al. Kings

8 County Superior Court Case No. 16C-0208, which was previously provided for the record of

9 Iproceedings.

10 55. As a result, the City's exclusion of reasonable notice to the public during its Site

11 Plan Review process violates the spirit and the letter of CEQA's full disclosure policy and the

12 due process and equal protection clauses of the California Constitution and the U.S. Constitution.

13

14 B. There is an Inconsistency Between Sections Regarding Notice to the Publie

15 56 . Under Section 17.70.070 of the proposed City Zoning Ordinance, Administrative

16 Use Permits are designated as "Non-Discretionary (p. 208), and "hearings" are identified and

17 described in Section 17.70.090. (p. 209)

18 57. However, Section 17.74.050, this section regulating Administrative Use Permits

19 provides for Findings at Section 17.74.040 and for Notices of decision that must be mailed to

20 each property owner within three hundred (300) feet of the subject property.

21 58. Petitioner alleges that this section is inconsistent with the "Site Plan Review"

22 section, based on the fact that the "Site Plan Review" section no longer contains a provision

23 which requires finding of consistency with the City General Plan, and there is no notice to

24 adjacent land owners or to the public of the Site Plan Review application or decision, or any

25 notice under CEQA.

26 59. Petitioner alleges that the Site Plan Review procedure completely excludes the

27 neighbors near and adjacent to the property subject to the SPR process; whereas, in the

28

31

A

1 Administrative Use Permit section 17.74, neighbors do received notice and do have a right to

2 appeal and appear at appeals, pursuant to the provisions of Section 17.74.060.

3 60. Wherefore, Petitioner alleges that the lack of due process and equal protection under

4 the Site Plan Review provisions deprive neighbors, and owners of property in close proximity to

5 the proposed project, of reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard and to appeal the

6 clandestine decision and action taken by the Director, and the lack of consistent notice and

7 appeal rights as are provided for neighbors and the public under the provisions of the

8 Administrative Use Permit process, deprived residents of the City of their due process rights and
9 equal protection of law, pursuant to CEQA, California Constitution Article 1, section 7(a) and

10 the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution.

11 PRAYER

12 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays this Honorable Court to enter judgment for Petitionesn
13 and against Respondents, as follows.

14 As to the First Cause of Action for Writ of Administrative Mandate re Violations of

15 CEQA:

Dear Ms, Cain:

Pursuant to Government Code section 65040.5 (a), the Governor's Office of Planning and Research (OPR) is required to notify cities and counties with general plans that have not been revised within the last eight years. Our records indicate that the City of Hanford's General Plan has not been revised in the past eight
years or longer.
For purposes of this notification, a revision is considered to be comprehensive update of at least five of the seven mandatory general plan elements, which have been adopted by the local legislative body. Accerding to our records, the mandatory elements of the general plan for the City of Hanford were last updated during the years noted. Our records also indicate that you are currently updating one or more elements and that you
expect that update to be completed in 2012.

If this information is incorrect, please contact the OPR State Clearinghouse via email
state.clearinghouse@opr.ca.gov or by phone (916) 445-0613 so that we may update our records.

As part of our process to identify jurisdictions with general plans that have not been revised in eight years, OPR surveyed local government planning agencles in the 2011 Annual Planning Survey for current information regarding their general plans. In addition, OPR reviewed General Plan Annual Progress Reports,
public notices from jurisdictions, environmental document filings, and jurisdictions' websites.

General plans that have not been revised within the past eight years are not necessarily legally inadequate. However, the California Supreme Court has stated that local governments have an implied duty to keep their
general ptans current (De Vita V, County of Napa, 9 Cal. 4th 763 (1995)). Additionally, local governments must
review and revise their general plans as often as they deem necessary or appropriate (Government Code
section 65108(a)). The general plan statutes do not provide a mandatory minimum timeframe for revision of

elements, except for housing elements, which must be revised based on the schedule established in
Government Code section 65588. In dition, Government Code sections 65302 and 65302.1 require certain
information be Included in general plan elements at the time a jurisdiction next revises Its housing element.
OPR is also required to notify the Attornay General's Office of cities and counties with general plans that have not been revised in ten years (Government Code section 65040,5(b)). If our records indicate that your general
plan has not been revised in ten years, we will be notifying the Attorney General in late July 2012.

If you would like to make corrections to our records, please respond by July 1, 2012. This will allow us to update our records prior to notifying the Attorney General of general plans that have not been revised in ten years. If you have any questions or require additional information, please contact the State Clearinghouse at

Defense Center (SJVEDC) and Hanford Environmental Awareness Team (HEAT)
Special Request for Notice of Availability of Response to Comments and
Final EIR and Date, Time, and Location of Public Hearing on Final GPU Update And Certification of Final EIR (FEIR)

Dear Ms. Mata:

Introduction

Enclosed please find Comments and Objections to the proposed City of Hanford 2035
General Plan Update (GPU) and the Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR) for this Project submitted on behalf of my clients, San Joaquin Valley Environmental Defense Center (SJVEDC)
and Hanford Environmental Awareness Team (HEAT), including additional written documentary
evidence to be included in the record of proceedings for this Project, including the following
documents:

1) "Mussel Slough Segments: Origins and Trends 1954 -- Present" (by Jim Paulus, Ph.D.
(August 16, 2007)

2) "Urban Water Conservation: Another Alternative" (by Richard L. Harriman, Valley
Voice, August 6, 2016, p. l1)
Please provide special written notice of the availability of the City's Response to Comments and the Final EIR and the Date, Time, and the Location of the Public Hearings on the

P

Final GPU Update and Certification of the FEIR before the City Planning Commission and the City Council to the email address on my office letterhead above at least ten (10) days prior to
these hearings.

Comments

1. The Circulation Element and DEIR are Inadequate

California Government Code section 65302, subd. (b) provides the City's General Plan
shall include:

"b) (1) A circulation element consisting of the general location and extent of existing and proposed major thoroughfares, transportation routes, terminals, any military airports and ports, and other local public utilities and facilities, all correlated with the land use element of the plan" (emphasis added)

This commentator was unable to locate text, map, or other diagram in the Draft General Plan or the DEIR which complies with the above-reference requirement. Both documents should be revised and amended to comply with this provision.
2. The Safety Element and DEIR are Inadequate
California Government Code section 65302, subd. (g) provides the City's General Plan shall include a Safety Element, defined as follows:
"(g) (1) A safety element for the protection of the community from any unreasonable risks associated with the effects of seismically
induced surface rupture, ground shaking, ground failure, tsunami,
seiche, and dam failure; slope instability leading to mudslides and
landslides; subsidence; liquefaction; and other seismic hazards identified pursuant to Chapter 7.8 (commencing with Section 2690) of Division 2 of the Public Resources Code, and other geologic hazards known to the legislative body; flooding; and wildland and urban fires. The safety element shall include mapping of known seismic and other geologic hazards. It shall also address evacuation routes, military installations, peakload water supply requirements, and
minimum road widths and clearances around structures, as those items
relate to identified fire and geologic hazards." (emphasis added)
This commentator was unable to locate text, map, or other diagram in the Draft General Plan or the DEIR which complies with the above-reference requirement. Both documents should be revised and amended to comply with this provision.

3. The Open Space Element and GP EIR are Inadequate
Although there are many things to like in the Open Space Element of the General Plan, (Government Code section 65302(e), there are a number of deficiencies in the Open Space
Element that are reflected in the DEIR.

Specifically, the Open Space Element incorporates by reference Government Code section 65560 et seq. Section 65560 provides, in relevant part:

"(b) "Open-space land" is any parcel or area of land or water that use as defined is essentially unimproved and devoted to an open-space in this section, and that is designated on a local, regional, or state open-space plan as any of the following: (1) Open space for the preservation of natural resources including, but not limited to, areas required for the preservation of plant and animal life, including habitat for fish and wildlife species; areas required for ecologic and other scientific study purposes; rivers, streams, bays, and estuaries; and coastal beaches, lakeshores, banks of rivers and streams, greenways, as defined in
Section 816.52 of the Civil Code, and watershed lands.

(3) Open space for outdoor recreation, including, but not limited to, areas of outstanding scenic, historic, and cultural value; areas particularly suited for park and recreation purposes, including access to lakeshores, beaches, and rivers and streams; and areas that serve as links between major recreation and open-space rescrvations, including utility easements, banks of rivers and streams, trails, greenways, and scenic highway corridors." (emphasis added)
In addition, Government Code section 65561 provides in relevant part:
"The Legislature finds and declares as follows: (a) That the preservation of open-space land, as defined in this article, is necessary not only for the maintenance of the economy of the state, but also for the assurance of the continued availability of land for the production of food and fiber, for the enjoyment of
scenic beauty, for recreation and for the use of natural resources."
(emphasis added)

HEAT and SJVEDC note that, in the DEIR, under Section 1.3.2, "Local Setting," the
City's EIR preparer states:
"The only natural watercourse found near the City is Mussel Slough, remnants of which still exist on the City's western edge. " [p. 1-5, middle paragraph, lines 3-20]

These commentators contend that the Draft General Plan and the DEIR fail to comply with the foregoing statutory mandate, due to the fact that the there is no specific and definite identification, recognition, and permanent protection of the historic Mussel Slough located within the Study Area. In fact, although the DEIR cites the Live Oak Master Plan on the west
side of Twelfth Avenue, south of SR 198, as follows:

"a single-family residential project that includes park facilities and open space on 390 acres. Located in the southeastern portion of the city, the site is bounded on the north by Hume Avenue, on the south by Houston Avenue, and on the east by Lone Oak Slough. Single-family lot sizes are planned to range from 3,200 square feet to 12,000 square feet. The single-family residential design includes small lot alley-accessed housing. The larger lots will retain conventional vehicle access. Twenty-one acres of parkland and 31.6 acres of open space/conservation land use will be linked together via a system of connected linear parks and pedestrian trails. The project is expected to take 5 to 5 10 years to fully build-out in six phases. The plans were approved in 2007 and some construction has begun." (emphasis added) [p.. 3-33 & 23]
Despite the fact that the Live Oak Master Plan was approved by the City nine (9) years ago, the lead agency has failed to recognize the precedent for permanent preservation and protection of natural water courses, such as Lone Oak Slough and, by implication, the historic Mussel Slough. The protection and preservation of the Mussel Slough was specifically raised by HEAT and this commentator during the Citizen Advisory Committee meetings and at the Scoping Session held on April 22, 2015. [See Meeting Notes attached to the NOP, DEIR, Vol. 2, Appendix A.]
Further, the Draft GPU and the DEIR have failed to include the specific implementation measures and/or Mitigation Measures necessary to preserve and protect the remaining portions of the Mussel Slough and its westerly "remnant" which extends from the Mussel Slough Remnant Drainage Basin onto the property owned by the Karyan Family Trust and other property owners to the west of 12 ½ Avenue, who were named in the pending lawsuit in Kings County Superior Court (Case No. 16C-0208), which has been served on the City of Hanford.
4. The Cumulative Impacts Section Regarding Biological Resources in Section 5.4.4 of the DEIR is Inadequate

The Cumulative Impacts Section of the DEIR, Section 5.4.4, at p. 5-5, is legally Inadequate because it fails to make a good faith effort to disclose, analyze, and consider the cumulative adverse impacts to the biological resources of the Mussel Slough which have been destroyed over the past fifty (50) years by developments approved by the City of Hanford and its

4

Staff, including without limitation, its City Engineer. In 2007, during to the litigation between HEAT and the City of Hanford relating to the development of the Lowe's Project by a client of the City's outside contract civil engineering firm, HEAT retained a professional biological consultant to prepare a study on the biological resource values of the Mussel Slough at that time. [See, the attached study by Jim Paulus, Ph.D., entitled "Mussel Slough Segments: Origins and Trends 1954 -- Present," August 16, 2007.
Based on the findings of Dr. Paulus, the cumulative adverse impacts on the riparian biological resources by the pattern and practice of filling in serial segments of the Mussel Slough have resulted in continued cumulative damage to this natural water course.

In addition, the original Land Use Map for the Draft GPU, when it was originally
considered by the Citizens Advisory Committee, in 2015, showed the Mussel Slough "remnant" connected to the Open Space identified for the proposed Open Space/Park in the area which was annexed into the City in 2007 as Reorganization 142. The proposed Draft GPU and DEIR now show a disconnected Open Space/Park location on the LU Map.

More significantly, neither the Draft GPU nor the DEIR include specific implementation
measures nor mitigation measures which implement the preservation and protection of the
Mussel Slough. Similarly, there are no mitigation measures identified or provided to provide
restoration of the Mussel Slough nor do these documents provide for permanent preservation of other areas of the Mussel Slough channel or for the portion of the Hidden Valley Park which the
City has proposed to sell for residential development.

Therefore, both the Draft GPU and the DEIR are legally inadequate because the lead
agency has failed to disclose, analyze, or consider the City's intent and previous efforts to convert a portion of the Open Space described in the DEIR section on Recreation and Parks; to- wit: the undeveloped western half of Hidden Valley Park, adjacent to the other Mussel Slough drainage basin located on the west side of Hidden Valley Park.

5. The Draft GPU and the DEIR are Inadequate Based on the Failure to Consider
an Alternative Mitigation Measure to Conserve Treated Effluent

The Draft GPU and the DEIR emphasize that the sole source of the City's municipal and
Industrial water supply is groundwater. There is discussion in the DEIR that the preferred alternative for the disposal of the treated urban wastewater is to provide it free of charge to agricultural users. Neither the Draft GPU nor the DEIR discuss the other statutorily mandated
alternative---specially, the reuse of treated urban wastewater by the population that uses the potable water and pays for its treatment---the residents of Hanford---for non-potable uses, such as irrigation of public and private landscaping, as well as other non-potable uses. Nowhere in the Draft GPU or the DEIR is there a reference to the mandate of Water Code section 13350 et seq.
that the reuse of treated urban wastewater is defined as a "beneficial use" and was mandate in the
2009 legislation adopted and codified in these sections.

5

a Attached is a copy of a recent article entitled, "Urban Water Conservation: Another Alternative," which appeared in the August 6, 2016 edition of the Valley Voice.
Therefore, these commentators submit that the Draft GPU and DEIR should be revised
and amended to discuss, analyze, and consider the alternative set forth in the attached article for
the reasons stated therein.

6. The Draft GPU and DEIR are Inadequate Due to the Lack of A Definite Time Stated for the Completion of the Storm Drainage Master Plan Water Management Plan and Water System Master Plan and Due to the Failure To Use the 2015 Urban Water Management Plan .

The Draft GPU and DEIR refer to a number of plans that the lead agency intends to
update at some indefinite time in the future. There is no legal or other authority cited for the
failure to have updated the plans prior to the adoption of the GPU or its DEIR.

Specifically, the DEIR states:

"The City of Hanford Storm Drainage Master Plan (City of Hanford 1995a) was prepared to develop innovative and creative means to provide effective and cost-efficient storm drainage planning to the City. The Master Plan discusses plans, development, and financing for the required storm drainage facilities that can be accomplished in a timely and cost-effective manner. The City's principal goals consisted of the identification of
current (and future) capacity deficiencies in the existing storm drainage system and
recommendations for system improvements to serve current and projected land uses. The City is currently in the process of updating its Storm Drainage Master Plan. The
General Plan Update and this EIR will be used to update this plan based on the preferred
land uses." [p. 3-21]

Similarly, the DEIR cites the following:

"WATER SYSTEM MASTER PLAN

The City of Hanford Water System Master Plan (City of Hanford 1996) provided the City with a tool for planning its water supply and distribution. The City is currently in the process of updating its Water System Master Plan. The General Plan Update and this EIR will be used to update this plan based on the preferred land uses." [p. 3-22]
Finally, the Draft GPU and the DEIR cite the City's 2010 Urban Water Master Plan (UWMP), rather than the 2015 Urban Water Master Plan, which was adopted in July, 2016. There is no reason provided for the use of the outdated 2010 UWMP

6

7. The Draft GPU and the DEIR are Inadequate, Based on the Failure to
Disclose, Analyze, and Consider the Mitigation Measures Adopted in The High Speed Rail Final EIR to Mitigate the Conversion of Prime
Agricultural Land to Urban Uses
In the DEIR, at p. 4.16-19, the Preparer refers to the High Speed Rail (HSR) Project, as
follows:

"In November 2013, the California High Speed Rail Commission identified the preferred route through the Planning Area. The selected route, which runs along the eastern edge of Hanford,roughly follows north-south route near the high voltage power lines between 7th and 8th Avenues. (City of Hanford 2014.)" [p. 4.16.19]

However, the DEIR fails to disclose, analyze, or consider that the Final EIR for the HSR
Project includes Mitigation Measures in the form of monetary compensation that is available to public entities, such as the City of Hanford and the County of King. These funds, were committed to mitigate the cumulative adverse impacts of the conversion of prime agricultural land in their jurisdiction or for indirect and secondary impacts arising from the conversion of agricultural and in close proximity to the City of Hanford. Thus, the City could apply for and be paid by the HSR Authority to the City to acquire agricultural land in or adjacent to the City to mitigate the significant unavoidable impacts from the conversion of agricultural land in the City's Sphere of Influence---thereby reducing or mitigating the acknowledged significant and unavoidable impacts reported by the lead agency as "unmitigable."
Therefore, these commentators contend that the Draft GPU and DEIR should be revised
and amended to include this implementation measure in the GPU and the alternative mitigation
measure in the DEIR, and analyze, and consider it it, accordingly.

Conclusion

For the foregoing reasons, these commentators submit that the foregoing revisions and amendments should be included in the record of proceedings, the Final General Plan Update, responded to in Response to Comments, and included in the Final EIR, prior to adoption of the GPU and certification of the Final EIR.

Mussel Slough Segments: Origins and Trends 1954 - Present
Jim Paulus, Ph.D.
August 16, 2007

Introduction

The question of whether Mussel Slough within and near the city limits of Hanford, California currently has value to public trust as a "resource" has engendered considerable disagreement. Opinions range from statements that no resource exists (City of Hanford, 2002, 2006, 2007) to the nearly antithetical view that resource with societal of the historic Mussel Slough channel have been value remains wherever segments maintained or somehow avoided (City of Hanford, 2004, Paulus, 2007). Biological resources such as wetland and riparian communities occupying a slough (segment) retain some level of functionality, as well as potential for continued or enhanced functionality, even within an urban setting where the historical extent and richness of the ecosystem has become progressively fragmented and degraded. The logical assumption that degraded functionality does not equate to total loss of value (ie., "degraded resource" is quite different from "no resource exists") underlies widely accepted methods that are available for use by responsible agencies and the public to judge resource quality and quantify impacts for a particular project or series of projects - indeed, these methods necessarily assume that disturbed or "atypical" conditions will be found at the majority of the remnant wetlands of any particular type and location (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1987). It has been estimated that more than 90% of California's pre-historical wetland resource has been lost through progressive filling, conversion and draining associated with farming and urbanization, the greatest loss rate of any State (National Marine Fisheries Service, 2007). Given the great loss of beneficial wetland functions that has already occurred, remaining areas of wetland resource must be given adequate protection by lead and responsible agencies through full investigation and disclosure of new impacts whenever an administrative action such as project permitting is considered. A preliminary investigation was undertaken to determine whether Mussel Slough segments remaining within and near the city limits of Hanford should be qualified as "resources" that can be impacted. The degree of loss that now is inherent to Mussel Slough, in terms of surface area, hydrology, and vegetation, was studied using a time series of high-resolution aerial reconnaissance photographs. Segments observed to be remaining in 2007 were visited in order to qualify and ground-truth the images. Images visible in the aerial photographs were referenced to vegetation types, level of ponding, and wetland character present within several segments where examples of primarily native plant assemblage were found. It is proper to conclude that no impacts will occur at the historical location of Mussel Slough only where no remaining wetland character can be documented. If wetland character is present at any Mussel Slough segment within a project area, appropriate studies that yield adequate quantitative data must be conducted for use in determining project-level and cumulative impacts, and to develop appropriate mitigations to offset new and cumulative losses. Coordination with outside agencies with possible

legal jurisdiction, such as the Army Corps of Engineers, California Department of Fish and Game, and regional Water Quality Control Board must be sought. By inference, the findings here can be used to broadly judge 1) whether Mussel Slough segments that no longer exist were biological resources, pursuant to determining cumulative impacts, and 2) determine the veracity of any statements that impart the
message "no resource exists" at locations where segments have been retained in various states of degradation.

Historical Trends Observed in Aerial Photographs

Mussel Slough in 1954

A black-and-white aerial photograph taken from a height of 31,500 ft on July 11, 1954 was visually analyzed to determine the extent of Mussel Slough during the height of the typical growing season in an era prior to the operation of Pine Flat Dam on the Kings River. The 1954 image, a high resolution (xx micron) scan provided by USGS-EROS, appears to show an interrupted riverine system extending from People's Ditch north of Hanford in the vicinity of xx Ave. east of Central Valley Highway, to Hume Ave. east of 14th Ave. Remnant segments of Mussel Slough appearing in the 1954 image were located in July 2007 using common maps (California Division of Highways, 1938, Kings County, 1976, California State Automobile Association, 1993). Segments with predominantly native character as scored by CDFG releve methodology (CDFG, 2000) in 2007 were mapped to slough pixels in the 1954 image (Figure 1). Segments MS1, MS2 and MS3 (Figure 1, site names MS1 through MS6 were assigned to segments remaining in 2007 as described in Tables 1-2) appear to be hydrologically linked by an incised channel 6200 ft long. The channel has a relatively irregular course and variable bank width. Small clusters of relatively dark pixels adjacent to segments MS1-MS3 and MS5-MS6 were found to be correlated to the positions of large oaks near the same course in 2007, verifying that the course of the slough in these remaining segments has not changed since 1954. Segment MS4 is isolated by filling due likcly to agricultural development that occurred pre-1954 (Figure 2), but is watered and contiguous with a channel that is also irregular and variable for at least three miles southward, past segment MS6. The sum length of Mussel Slough channel shown in the 1954 image between the north edge of MS-1 (Fargo Avenue) and MS-6 (Oak Street) was determined to be 29,000 ft. using Global Mapper v.8. Average width at 25 points was 60 ft d: 18 ft. This provides a rough estimate of 41 acres of channel in 1954. Error inherent to length calculation is not provided in the documentation of this program. To provide an estimate of error, consider that the width of the drawing tool line was observed to be about pixel. If overlap during mapping is maximal at all points, error would be 2 pixels per mapping segment, in this case a maximal error due to line width of about 3 acres. Error due to width averaging
would be about 12 acres.

Mussel Slough in 1975
An acrial photograph taken from height of 65,000 ft on January 24, 1975 was visually analyzed for the strength of infrared (IR) signature for photosynthetically active vegetation. Wetland vegetation, due to the characteristic presence of water and dark soils, can remain active (as opposed to dormant, or fallow field) even during the coldest time of year (typically November through January) in the Hanford arca. The image that was
analyzed, a high resolution (24 micron) scan provided by USGS-EROS, shows that the 1954 MS4 to MS6 continuous channel has been fragmented into four separate segments during the intervening 20 years. Intervening channel areas have been filled, the loss in most places appearing to have resulted from agricultural development. Loss of one channel area south of Grangeville Blvd., which was measured in the 1954 image at about 2 acres, has been filled for housing development. All remaining segments appear to be watered, and the MS4 segment is reflecting brightly in the IR bandwidth (Figure 3), indicating high vegetative cover density. Segments MS3 and MS5 have been largely devegetated and flow control structures have been installed (Figure 4). In contrast to the wetland-type signature apparent throughout MS4, the MS3 and MS5 segments reflect darkly and appear to have been converted to ponds. The dense tree canopies at segments MS6 and SS1, meanwhile, appear relatively undisturbed (Figure 5). It is estimated that 15% of the 1954 Mussel Slough bed and bank habitat extent has disappeared from the area covered in the 1975 image.

Mussel Slough in 1986
Color IR aerial reconnaissance photographs dated July 1, 1986 were analyzed to determine the change in IR signature that may be attributable to change in Mussel Slough condition during the period 1974-1986. Additional details of slough condition were also made available in the 1986 series, as they were taken at a lower altitude of 12,000 ft, with greater resolution (1:24,000 scale) and stereoscopic overlap. Analysis using a stereoscope (6x magnification) of image pairs of remaining Mussel Slough segments was used to determine that segments M1-M3 remained in an uninterrupted (contiguous) condition. Segment M2 had by this date been converted to Hidden Valley Park and vegetative cover within the slough channel has increased. The channel throughout this area is becoming closely lined by housing developments, and the channel in these areas appears more regular in terms of bank width (Figure 6). Segment MS4 has been fitted with flow control structures, and is extensively ponded (Figure 7). Segment MS5, meanwhile, appears to be drying in comparison to 11 years earlier, and the relatively bright IR reflectance indicates vegetative recovery (Figure 8). Overall, xx% of Mussel Slough extent showing high vegetative cover or ponding in 1974 had been converted or had otherwise lost the photosynthetic activity that would be evident in IR reflectance. Given the July date, it is unlikely that natural processes (eg., climate, plant community dynamics) could cause photosynthetic activity in 1996 to be relatively lower in selective areas that were mapped as predominantly vegetation-covered in 1974. Close inspection of moderate resolution (xx micron) scans of the 1986 color IR

•

images suggests that land use practices underlie at least some if not all of the loss of photosynthetic activity associated with Mussel Slough.
Mussel Slough in 1994
USGS DOQ orthophoto composites dated May 11, 1994 were compared with the lower resolution 1954 aerial reconnaissance photograph, finding losses in slough extent and segment connectivity similar to those pointed out in the 1974-1986 color IR images. The 1994 image, the same black-and-white image that is available by download from Terraserver, has a relatively high resolution of 1 meter. Individual trees within remnant Mussel Slough segments can be resolved (Figure xx). The 1994 image suggests that most of the overall loss of Mussel Slough resource has occurred through filling. Fields visible in 1954 appear larger in 1994, replacing the dark line of the slough piecemeal. The linear trace of predominantly dark-colored native vegetation representing the aquatic/wetland ecosystem became increasingly interrupted by cropping systems during the 40 years between images. Other land uses contribute to the change, including housing and retail development associated with the urbanization of lands west of downtown Hanford (Figure xx).

Mussel Slough in 2002
A final color IR image collected by NAPP from an altitude of 20,000 ft on May 29, 2002 was analyzed for the strength of IR signature for photosynthetically active vegetation. In the 2002 image, it is apparent that the trend of Mussel Slough loss that is established in the 1986 to 1994 comparison was continued during the 1994-2002 period. However, agricultural development is no longer the most important contributor to Mussel Slough loss. Urbanization is associated with xx% of the total loss; as observed on the 2002 photograph, approximately xx acres of the 1994 Mussel Slough extent north of Highway 198 has been replaced by housing, roads, and retail development (Figure xx).

Current Conditions at Mussel Slough

Mussel Slough in 2007
An attempt was made to locate all remaining segments of Mussel Slough visible in the 2002 color IR image. Site observations were made from public streets where they intersected intact segments. A total of 6 segments having some degree of natural system integrity (a presence primarily native vegetation, obvious bed and bank structures, signs of recent ponding or scour) were found (Table 1). One additional segment, recently labeled "Sand Slough" (City of Hanford, 2007), was also visited. All of the segments found were described briefly (Table 2), detailed vegetation characteristics (stand or community type, dominant species identification by stratum, height and cover provided, see Appendix A) were recorded using a CDFG releve technique (CDFG, 2000), and photographs were taken. All segments found to have maintained some natural system integrity were found to occur within three to five miles

4

of segment MS-4. XX intervening segments present in 2002 were found to have been converted or filled in August 2007. For example, Mussel Slough immediately adjacent to the BNSF right-of-way to the north of W. Grangeville Blvd. has been widened and converted to an (unvegetated) drainage basin. Immediately south of the tracks, a small remnant channel fragment has been filled to construct housing (Figure x).
Table 1. Locations of six slough segments visited in August 2007. Five segments are associated with the historical course of Mussel Slough, and one is associated with Sand Slough. All segments are within 5.0 miles of site MS-4.

The vegetative cover provided by trees ("tree canopy") observed at these seven sites typically included very large, old trees that were invariably situated atop the banks, supporting the assumption that historic changes in channel course had not occurred. This is supported also by the consistent locations of these segments in the available historic photographs. Often impressive oaks (to 50" dbh, and 60 ft in height) dominate the tree canopy in segments both "upstream" and "downstream" from MS-4 (MS-4 is arbitrarily chosen for relating site comparisons, as it falls centrally within the length of Mussel Slough being described here). The vegetation community present in segments dominated by valley oak (Quercus lobata) was classified as Great Valley Valley Oak Riparian Woodland (#71.040.07), using CDFG nomenclature (equivalent to #61430 in Holland, 1986). This community and all other California communities dominated by valley oak are

7

•1 D

considered sensitive by the State (CDFG, 2003). Only segment MS-4 lacks these large oaks, although some young trees have been recently re-planted in limited areas (per City of Hanford, 2004). Fremont cottonwood of large stature are also usually present atop the banks, but they provide the greatest percentage of the tree canopy only at SS-1. Smaller, younger willows and native walnut occupy lower bank and bed positions, especially in gaps where the larger oak and cottonwood canopies are absent. Shrub and herb canopy cover is typically dominated by non-native species within all segments where surface water was not present. Even where water is present as weak flows or seasonal ponding, native dominance is restricted to narrow bands adjacent to the surface water, and drier areas are invariably dominated by non-native blackberry, annual goosefoot, and annual grasses such as Avena fatua. Non-native shrub and herb cover can be dense in tree canopy gap areas, especially where older trees are not present. It is likely that older native tree dominance maintains understory native plant dominance through shading and litter accumulation, which was observed to be especially dense at sites MS-5, MS-6, and SS-1. Similarly, proliferation of non-native shrubs (chiefly, blackberry) and shrubby native willows appears to be limited in situations where an older tree canopy has been maintained. In urban settings (MS-1, MS-2, MS-3), understory management for fire fuel reduction may also be influencing the plant assemblage. In any case, stands of native elderberry, young oaks, and seedling Fremont cottonwood have established shrub canopy dominance in tree-shaded habitats.
As already mentioned, the presence of surface water strongly influences the native character of the vegetation, especially within the herb stratum. Surface water in August, at the mid-to-late dry season, was found within segments bounded by developed housing
and other drained impervious surfaces. In addition to higher plant diversity and incrcased native dominance, these segments had notably higher use by birds (waterfowl, riparian songbirds, jays), amphibians, and people. Segments bounded by open fields or agriculture were found to be dry, with the exception of the upper 30 feet of SS-1. All sites have been fitted with culverts on their "upstream" edges. All sites receive flows from this and from other possible sources (eg., shallow groundwater discharge into excised Mussel Slough segments bounded by housing with perennial landscaping), with the possible exception of MS-4. Access was not available to inspect the channel closely for scour at any point, however, given that the segment is closely bounded by large, recently constructed drainage basins of great depth, the likelihood that surface ponding or flows could now be established in the significantly shallower bed of the adjacent Mussel Slough seems low. The presence of many dead or dying larger willows, as well as the presence of scattered homeless encampments throughout this segment, and also may indicate perennially dry conditions are now typical for MS-4.

Conclusions

Although historically much of the original riverine Mussel Slough has been lost to filling and progressive urbanization, small segments have been maintained as intact, mainly internally drained, natural wetland systems.

A trend of drying of Mussel Slough soil habitats is documented in historical photographs, likely causing a loss of native aquatic plant and animal diversity, and opening new niches for invasive non-native plants.
The presence of large, older trees is associated strongly with increased maintenance of native character among the understory shrub and herb assemblage.
Data collected during site visits in August 2007 give no cause to remove any functions from the list of Mussel Slough wetland functions and values proposed by Paulus (2007). This list is suitable for the purposes of directing environmental analysis of Mussel Slough that may be required under CEQA for actions by the City of Hanford.
Slough segments MS1, MS2, MS3, MS4, MS5, and SS-1 visited in August 2007 and documented here would be suitable for use as "reference wetlands" in a Wetlands Functions and Values study conducted for the purpose of evaluating project-related direct impacts and cumulative impacts to remaining Mussel Slough resources, or for planning slough rehabilitation as urbanization proceeds within the City of Hanford.
As a responsible agency, the City of Hanford must use all available evidence to support conclusions regarding evaluating project-related direct impacts and cumulative impacts to remaining Mussel Slough resources. Information regarding the presence and historical losses of Mussel Slough resources was readily available during the preparation of this report and should be available to the City of Hanford as it proceeds with actions that will result in further urbanization of the Mussel Slough area.
To this author's knowledge, segment MS-4 is in the most immediate danger of being converted. Although existing resources are certainly degraded at MS-4 in comparison to other remnants, the findings in this report singularly refute any contention that slough resources are not present as MS-4.

Re: City of Hanford 2035 General Plan Update (GPU)
General Plan Amendment (GPA) No. 2017-02
Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR) (SCH # 201541024) Municipal Code Amendment No. 2017-01 (Zoning Ordinance No. 17-04) Summary of Objections and Requests Submitted on Behalf of San Joaquin Valley
Environmental Defense Center (SJVEDC) and Hanford Environmental
Awareness Team (HEAT) re the Proposed FEIR, GPU, and Zoning Ordinance
Hearing Date: April 18, 2017

Honorable Mayor Ayers and Council Members:

This office has been retained to submit the following objections and requests on behalf of
the San Joaquin Valley Environmental Defense Center (SJVEDC), a California non-profit corporation in good standing with the State of California (Corporation No. C3999627), having its principal place of business in Visalia, California, and Hanford Environmental Awareness Team (HEAT), a California unincorporated association, having its principal place of business in Hanford, California, and as a private attorney general, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 1021.5.

Introduction

Enclosed please find the Summary of Objections and Requests to and regarding the
proposed City of Hanford 2035 General Plan Update (GPU), Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR), and the Zoning Ordinance No. 12-04 submitted on behalf of my clients. Center
(SJVEDC) and Hanford Environmental Awareness Team (HEAT), including additional written documentary evidence to be included in the record of proceedings for these matters.

Objections to MEIR and GPU

1. The FEIR Relies Upon Outdated Information

The City was notified by the Governor's Office of Planning and Research (OP&R) on
June 1, 2012 that the City's General Plan needed to be updated.
As the Staff Report, dated April 4, 2017 states, "The work on the 2035 General Plan Update began in 2013....The 2035 General Plan Background Report was finalized in January 2014." [p. 161, Section 13.A.a, "Background Information"]
The Staff Report of April 4, 2017 states:
"The Housing Element and Air Quality Element were not included as the Housing Element was updated in accordance with State Requirements in 2016 and the Air Quality Element was prepared and adopted in 2010 and was not included in the update." [Page 162, paragraph 2, last sentence.]
The FEIR relied for its Air Quality Analysis on information that is, at least, seven (7) years old, and the FEIR performed no current Air Quality Analysis upon which it relied in its cumulative adverse impacts analysis and in the City's Statement of Overriding Considerations. [See Attachment 1 (Findings of Fact) and Attachment 2 (Statement of Overriding
Considerations)]

Therefore, the City, acting as the lead agency under CEQA will abuse its discretion to the prejudice of my clients and the general public, by failing to proceed in the manner required by law, pursuant to Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5. My clients and request that this matter be remanded to staff and a current Air Quality analysis be prepared and circulated to the public for review and comment, prior to being brought back before your Council for final
review and action.

2. The Statement of Overriding Considerations Fails to Weigh and Balance
The Significant Adverse Effects of the Projects with the Benefits Asserted
Although the proposed Statement of Overriding Considerations (SOR) does set forth the significant, unavoidable impacts to air quality, it does not quantify the public health and safety impacts to the public, nor does it quantify the benefits from the proposed project, in a manner that weighs and balances in a quantitative fashion that permits the lead agency to perform the "weighing and balancing" duty enunciated in CEQA Guidelines [California Code of Regulations, Title 14, sections 15091-15094] [See Attachment 2, pp.227 et seq.J
The basis for this objection is that, while the SOR does a pro forma recitation of the
significant unavoidable and unmitigable adverse impacts, it omits the next logical procedure of identifying the factors it will rely upon to measure, weigh, and balance the benefits, which are
stated in a vague and general fashion, without a deliberate identification and systematic

2

A •

comparison with the detriment. Due to this omission in the analysis, reasoning, and comparison of each detriment with each benefit claimed, the lead agency cannot describe the specific data or upon which the lead agency relies on for its ultimate determination on each specific reasons
impact imposed vs. the benefit gained. From a logical context, the lead agency's SOR lacks the chain of reason from "impact" (detriment) compared with specific "benefit," so that the political accountability of the decision-makers' reasoning and action can be understood and properly evaluated by the public.
Therefore, this procedural defect in the SOR, if approved by the City Council, would constitute an abuse of discretion to the prejudice to my clients and the general public and a failure to proceed in the manner required by law, in violation of PRC sections 21168 and 21168.5. My clients and I request that the proposed SOR be remanded to staff for further review
and amendment, accordingly.

3. The City Failed to Comply with the Enviroumental Justice Doctrine By Failing to Provide Adequate Notice, Public Outreach, and Opportunity To be Heard, as Required by CEQA

The General Background Report, prepared in March 2015, at page 2-14, states:
"Hispanic origin of any race makes-up 49% of the city's population."
The Report also recognizes other ethnic groups, such as Black, Asian, and two-or-more racial background, as well as non-English speaking residents who are Portuguese. Suffice it to say that Hanford is, certainly, a "diverse" racial and ethnic community.
The California Attorney General has published a guidance memorandum, entitled "Environmental Justice at the Local and Regional Level - Legal Background." (July 10, 2012) [Copy attached] The first two paragraphs of this document states:
"Cities, counties, and other local governmental entities have an important role to play in ensuring environmental justice for all of California's residents. Under
state law:

"[E]nvironmental justice" means the fair treatment of people of all races, Cultures, and incomes with respect to the development, adoption, implement- tation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies.
(Gov. Code, § 65040.12, subd. (e) Fairness in this context means that the benefits of a healthy environment should be available to everyone, and the burdens of pollution should not be focused on sensitive populations or on communities that are already
experiencing its adverse effects."

3

In this guidance from the State of California Department of Justion, the publication notes the potential application to environmental settings and cumulative impacts. Both of these issues are
involved in the consideration of the legal adequacy of the proposed FEIR.
In addition, SB 1000 [Government Code Section 56302(h)], adopted and signed into law in 2016, and becomes effective in 2017, provides direction as to the importance of Environmental Justice to all minority groups in California, whose health, safety, and welfare may be directly or indirectly impacted by land use decisions, particularly from General Plans (especially, Land Use Elements). Essential to the statutorily recognized Doctrine of Environmental Justice is the due process concept of fairness, which involves reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard.
Although my clients or I attended almost all of the Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) meetings and have followed the General Plan Update process closely from its inception. However, neither my clients nor I have been able to locate any notices in the record of proceedings published or circulated in Spanish, Portuguese, or Asian publications or copies of materials in any language, other than English. Also, in my efforts to locate copies of complete documents, such as the FEIR or the GPU, I was unable to locate them at the Kings County Library in Hanford, when I last checked on the morning of April 5, 2017. [Source, Sherman Lee, Reference Librarian, Kings County Library,
Hanford.]

Likewise, neither my clients nor I recall having seen any Spanish or other language interpreters at public meetings; nor have we seen any written summaries in Spanish, Portuguese, or Asian languages. Similarly, my clients and I have not encountered any analysis memorialized in writing contained in the record which sets forth when or how the lead agency analyzed its duty of outreach to the minority and disadvantaged communities within the City of Hanford. Finally, my clients and I contend that the City needs to implement the principles of environmental justice in their analysis and reasoning in the Statement of Overriding Considerations, especially, with respect to environmental setting and cumulative impacts analysis of air quality impacts.

The OP&R General Plan Guidelines, at pp.22- 23 cite specific prohibitions against precisely
the unfair processes engaged in by the City in its GPU process. Specifically, the lack of outreach and/or meetings in local minority or underserved communities and failure to have language accommodation (both written and oral) throughout the 4-year process. [See copy of pp. 22-23
attached; sce, also, pp. 142-148 regarding methodologies to increase participation.]
Finally, my clients and I submit that the lead agency has not complied with the principles of the Environmental Justice and that these matters should be remanded to City Staff to engage in a concerted effort to comply with the provisions of state law set forth by the Attorney General, especially with respect to outreach and consideration of disproportionate impacts on members of
minority communities within the City,
Therefore, the failure of the lead agency to comply with the foregoing request would constitute an abuse of discretion to the prejudice to my clients and the general public and a failure to proceed in the manner required by law, in violation of PRC sections 21168 and 21168.5. My clients and : request that the proposed FEIR. be remanded to staff for further review and amendment, accordingly.

4. The GPU is Legally Inadequate Due to the Failure to Include Implementation Measures for All Policies.

As was note in paragraph 1 above, the City Staff and its Consultants have been working on the GPU and its supporting documents since 2013. Thus, the City Staff and its consultants have had over four (4) years within which to prepare implementation measures, as noted in in the OP&R General Plan Guidelines read into the record by my clients' consultant, Douglas
Mclsaac. [General Plan Guidelines, at pp. 22-23; copies attached]

Mr. McIsaac has been a practicing planner and, most recently, the Director of Community Development and Planning for the City of Bakersfield. Specifically, Mr. Mclsaac opined that the State's General Plan Guidelines and planning principles require an implementation measure for each policy adopted in the City's General. In addition, Mr. McIsaac testified that the General Plan should avoid using vague, uncertain, and imprecise language in the General Plan implementation measures. [The same is true for the Mitigation Measures in the FEIR]
Therefore, it is particularly important to note that there are no specifically worded implementation measures identified for the identification, protection, and preservation of the natural watercourses remaining in the City Study area, as defined in the proposed GPU.
As a result, my clients and submit that, the proposed GPU be remanded to Staff and their consultants to prepare a Implementation Measures to be included in the proposed GPU for circulation, review, and comments by my clients and the general public, prior to bringing the revised GPU back to your Council for approval.
In the likely event that City Staff or its consultants recommend that the City Council approve and adopt the proposed GPU in its present form and, then, consider and adopt proposed Mitigation Measures for each Policy on a seriatim basis, my clients and I contend that the City has had over four (4) years to prepare the Implementation Measures required for each Policy in the General Plan. Neither my clients nor the general public should have to wait to have the City Staff take another four years to include the Implementation Measures in the GPU.--especially,
when the City will commence approving projects and developments based upon the approval and
adoption of the proposed GPU, without waiting for the required Implementation Measures to be prepared, circulated for public review, approved, and adopted.

Please be assured that such an improvident course of action will not be tolerated by my
clients or the general public. The failure to proceed in the manner required by law will constitute an abuse of discretion prejudicial to my clients and the general public and will violate Govt.
Code sections 65300, 65300.5 and 65302.

5. The Proposed General Plan Violates the Equal Status Among Elements Doctrine

The GPU's failure to treat all elements of the General Plan equally violates the Equal

-

Status Among Elements Doctrine. This doctrine is set forth in the OP&R General Plan
Guidelines, as follows:

"All elements of the general plan have equal legal status. For example, the land use element policies are not superior to the policies of the open-space element. (citing Sierra Club Board of Supervisors of Kern County (1981) 126 Cal.App.3d 698)"
[General Plan Guidelines, p. 12; copy attached.]

The basis of this contention is highlighted by the testimony of Mr. McIsaac, in that without specific Implementation Measures in the GPU and precise language that is susceptible of specific enforcement, the Land Use Element is de facto elevated above the Conservation and Open Spacc Elements. Similarly, proposed FEIR is of no source of protection of undeveloped open space, natural water courses, or riparian resources without robust Mitigation Measures that
are enforceable, due to the wholesale surrender of almost all undeveloped natural resources
through the Findings of Overriding Significance, which is challenged hereinabove, and due to the complete lack of an updated Action Plan to conserve and protect what little undeveloped Open Space land remains within the City limits.
Another deficiency in the GPU is the apparent lack of a completed Master Bicycle Plan, which appears as a draft on the City's home page website. With respect to the quadrant of the City defined by W. Lacey Boulevard on the north, Twelfth Avenue on the east, the San Joaquin Valley Railroad (SJVR) on the south, and Thirteenth Avenue on the west, there is no park site, safe route to school, or pedestrian or bicycle trail identified on the Land Use and Circulation
Map, nor are there identified bicycle routes from the intersection of Front Street and Thirteenth Street on the south side of W. Lacey Boulevard to Centennial Drive nor north of the SJVR.
This fact is of great importance to my clients, due to the lack of safe access to the area described as Open Space west of the Super Wal-Mart Shopping Center, including the Mussel Slough drainage basin and the Open Space which extends to the west of the drainage basin. Also, it is extremely important to my clients that there are no sidewalks from Front Street on Thirteenth Avenue and on the south side of W. Lacey Boulevard east to Centennial. This
demonstrates the lack of concern for the equality of maintaining access to the undeveloped Open Space and safe routes to school and to the W. Lacey Boulevard and Twelfth Avenue mega- shopping center that are auto-centric and not planned for inter-modal 21st century pedestrian and bicycle transportation, which the City states it is promoting and relying upon to reduce or mitigation additional air pollution impacts in its Findings of Overriding Consideration for the acknowledged significant, unavoidable, and unmitigable air quality impacts.
Thus, one can readily identify and perceive the inequality of the Land Use, Conservation, Open Space, and Air Quality Elements. Therefore, my clients object to the inequal treatment of these elements and request that the GPU be remanded to Staff and their consultants to correct this defect in the GPU and to revise, re-circulate for public review and comment and bring back to
your Council for further consideration.

Conclusion

HEAT and SJVEDC note that, in the DEIR, under Section 1.3.2, "Local Setting," the
City's EIR preparer states:

"The only natural watercourse found near the City is Mussel Slough, remnants of which still exist on the City's western edge. [p. 1-5, middle paragraph, lines 3-20]
These commentators contend that the Draft General Plan and the DEIR fail to comply statutory mandate to provide Implementation Measures concurrently with the consideration of the proposed GPU and to have an Action Plan provided to provide public access to public developed and undeveloped Opens Space. We reiterate the fact that the there is no specific and definite identification, recognition, and permanent protection of the historic Mussel Slough located within the Study Arca. In fact, although the DEIR cites the Live Oak Master Plan on the west side of Twelfth Avenue, south of SR 198, as follows:

6g single-family residential project that includes park facilities and open space on 390 acres. Located in the southeastern portion of the city, the site is bounded on the north by
Hume Avenue, on the south by Houston Avenue, and on the east by Lone Oak Slough.
Single-family lot sizes are planned to range from 3,200 square feet to 12,000 square feet. The single-family residential design includes small lot alley-accessed housing. The larger lots will retain conventional vehicle access. Twenty-one acres of parkland and 31.6 acres of open space/conservation land use will be linked together via a system of connected linear parks and pedestrian trails. The project is expected to take 5 to 10 years to fully build-out in six phases. The plans were approved in 2007 and some construction has begun." (emphasis added) Lp.. 3-33 & 23]

Despite the fact that the Live Oak Master Plan was approved by the City nine (9) years
ago, the lead agency has failed to recognize the precedent for permanent preservation and
protection of natural water courses, such as Lone Oak Slough and, by implication, the historic
Mussel Slough. The protection and preservation of the Mussel Slough was specifically raised by
HEAT and this commentator during the Citizen Advisory Committee meetings and at the
Scoping Session held on April 22, 2015. [See Meeting Notes attached to the NOP, DEIR, Vol. 2,
Appendix A.]
Further, the Draft GPU and the DEIR have failed to include the specific implementation
measures and/or Mitigation Measures necessary to preserve and protect the remaining portions of
the Mussel Slough and its westerly "remnant" which extends from the Mussel Slough Remnant
Drainage Basin onto the property owned by the Karyan Family Trust and other property owners

7

Finally, my clients and I request on behalf of the members of the general public that the
City increase its investment in bicycle and pedestrian facilities with a concentration around
schools and businesses. The benefits provided by walking or riding a bicycle are realized in
increased physical activity, improved health, and improved air quality. The Stakeholder Working
Group focused on providing more bicycle and pedestrian facilities around schools and between
residential neighborhoods and frequented destinations such as community and commercial
facilities. We, again, urge your Council to increase investment in public transportation with
concentrations and connectivity between all public parks and open spaces.
My clients and I are prepared to support a revised General Plan Update, which corrects
the deficiencies set forth above and includes Implementation Measures that support the foregoing
principles of preservation of and public access to developed and undeveloped public Open Space.

Respectfully submitted,

KAMALA D. HARRIS
Attorney General State of California
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

Environmental Justice at the Local and Regional Level
Legal Background

Cities, counties, and other local governmental entities have an important role to play in ensuring environmental justice for all of California' residents. Under state law:
"[E]nvironmental justice" means the fair treatment of people of all races, cultures, and incomes with respect to the development, adoption, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies.

(Gov. Code, § 65040.12, subd. (e).) Fairness in this context means that the benefits of a healthy
environment should be available to everyone, and the burdens of pollution should not be focused
on sensitive populations or on communities that already are experiencing its adverse effects.
Many local governments recognize the advantages of environmental justice; these include healthier children, fewer school days lost to illness and asthma, a more productive workforce,
and a cleaner and more sustainable environment. Environmental justice cannot be achieved, however, simply by adopting generalized policies and goals. Instead, environmental justice requires an ongoing commitment to identifying existing and potential problems, and to finding and applying solutions, both in approving specific projects and planning for future development.
There are a number of state laws and programs relating to environmental justice. This document explains two sources of environmental justice-related responsibilities for local governments, which are contained in the Government Code and in the California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA).

Government Code

Government Code section 11135, subdivision (a) provides in relevant part:

No person in the State of California shall, on the basis of race, national origin, ethnic group identification, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, color, or disability, be unlawfully denied full and equal access to the benefits of, or be unlawfully subjected to discrimination under, any program or activity that is conducted, operated, or administered by the state or by any state agency, is funded directly by the state, or receives any financial assistance from the state....
While this provision does not include the words "environmental justice," in certain circumstances, it can require local agencies to undertake the same consideration of fairness in the distribution of environmental benefits and burdens discussed above. Where, for example, a general plan update is funded by or receives financial assistance from the state or a state agency, the local government should take special care to ensure that the plan's goals, objectives, policies

and implementation measures (a) foster equal access to a clean environment and public health benefits (such as parks, sidewalks, and public transportation); and (b) do not result in the unmitigated concentration of polluting activities near communities that fall into the categories defined in Goverment Code section 11135. In addition, in formulating its publie outreach for the general plan update, the local agency should evaluate whether regulations governing equal "opportunity to participate" and requiring "alternative communication services" (e.g., translations) apply. (See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 22, 8§ 98101, 98211.)
Government Code section 11136 provides for an administrative hearing by a state agency to decide whether a violation of Government Code section 11135 has occurred. If the state agency determines that the local government has violated the statute, it is required to take action to
"curtail" state funding in whole or in part to the local agency. (Gov. Code, § 11137.) In
addition, a civil action may be brought in state court to enforce section 11135. (Gov. Code, cO
11139.)

California Environmental Quality Act (CEOA)

Under CEQA, "public agencies should not approve projects as proposed if there are feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures available which would substantially lessen the
significant environmental effects of such projects ....' (Pub. Res. Code, § 21002.) Human beings are an integral part of the "environment." An agency is required to find that a "project may have a 'significant effect on the environment' if among other things, "[t]he environmental eflects of a project will cause substantial adverse effects on human beings, either directly or
indirectly[.l" (Pub. Res. Code, § 21083, subdl. (b)(3): see also CEOA Guidelines,4 cop 15126.2
[(noting that a project may cause a significant a effect by bringing people to hazards].)

CEQA does not use the terms "fair treatment" or "environmental justice." Rather, CEQA centers on whether a project may have a significant effect on the physical environment. Still, as set out below, by following well-established CEQA principles, local governments can further
environmental justice.

CEQA's Purposes

The importance of a healthy environment for all of California's residents is reflected in CEQA's purposes. In passing CEQA, the Legislature determined:

"The maintenance of a quality environment for the people of this state now and in the future is a matter of statewide concern." (Pub. Res. Code, § 21000, subd. (a).)

• We must "identify any critical thresholds for the health and safety of the people of the state and take all coordinated actions necessary to prevent such thresholds from being
reached." (Id. at subd. (d).)

To support a finding that such concentration will not occur, the local government likely will need to identity candidate communities and assess their current burdens. The CEQA Guidelines (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, §§ 15000, et seq.) are available at
wioescowy.d.

"[MJajor consideration [must be] given to preventing environmental damage, while providing a decent home and satisfying living environment for every Californian." (Id at subd. (g).)
We must "[t]ake all action necessary to provide the people of this state with clean air and water, enjoyment of aesthetic, natural, scenic, and historic environmental qualities, and freedom from excessive noise.' (Pub. Res. Code, § 21001, subd. (b).)

Specific provisions of CEQA and its Guidelines require that local lead agencies consider how the environmental and public health burdens of a project might specially affect certain communities. Several examples follow.

Environmental Setting and Cumulative Impacts

There are a number of different types of projects that have the potential to cause physical impacts to low-income communities and communities of color. One example is a project that will emit
pollution. Where a project will cause pollution, the relevant question under CEQA is whether
the environmental effect of the pollution is significant. In making this determination, two long- standing CEQA considerations that may relate to environmental justice are relevant -- setting and
cumulative impacts.

It is well established that "[the significance of an activity depends upon the setting." (Kings
County Farm Bureau v. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 718 [citing CEQA
Guidelines, § 15064, subd. (b)]; see also id. at 721; CEQA Guidelines, § 15300.2, subd. (a) §
[noting that availability of listed CEQA exceptions "are qualified by consideration of where the project is to be located - a project that is ordinarily insignificant in its impact on the environment a may in a particularly sensitive environment be significant."I) For example, a proposed project's particulate emissions might not be significant if the project will be located far from populated areas, but may be significant if the project will be located in the air shed of a community whose a residents may be particularly sensitive to this type of pollution, or already arc experiencing higher-than-average asthma rates. A lead agency therefore should take special care to determine whether the project will expose "sensitive receptors" to pollution (see, e.g., CHQA Guidelines, App. G); if it will, the impacts of th at pollution are more likely to be significant.'
In addition, CEQA requires a lead agency to consider whether a project's effects, while they might appear limited on their oWl1, are "cumulatively considerable" and therefore significant. (Pub. Res. Code, § 21083, subd. (b)(3).) "[C]umulatively considerable' means that the incremental effects of an individual project are considerable when viewed in connection with the effects of past projects, the effects of other current projects, and the effects of probable future
3 "TA] number of studies have reported increased sensitivity to pollution, for communities with low income levels, low education levels, and other biological and social factors. This combination of multiple pollutants and increased sensitivity in these communities can result in a higher cumulative pollution impact."

April18, 2017

Good evening, Mayor Ayers and members of the Council:

My name is Doug Mclsaac. By way of introduction, I have worked in municipal planning for a total of 37
years, most recently having retired as Community Development Director for the City of Bakersfield. In
that time, I have had extensive experience with the development, implementation, and administration
of General Plans.

I have been retained by the San Joaquin Valley Environmental Defense Center and HEAT to offer my
evaluation of the proposed Hanford General Plan update as an experienced professional. Based on my
review, I have concluded that the draft document has some deficiencies that require modification and
amendment, in order to be compliant with the State General Plan law and Guidelines.

Mr. Harriman did a good job in summarizing these issues in his letter dated April 13 and I concur with his
assessment. In the interest of time, I want to highlight just a few things, in particular.

I'm sure you're aware of the saying that the General Plan is considered to be the city's "constitution," particularly, with regard to land use and associated issues. Over the course of time, through new laws,
policy, case law, and changes in professional practice, there has been increasing emphasis placed on
General Plans not only to reflect a commitment to adopted policy, but also to include a commitment to
implement those policies through meaningful and concrete actions.

In this regard, there are two things in particular that a contemporary, adequate General Plan is required
to do in the way of policy development that the proposed General Plan does not do on a consistent
basis, particularly related to issues of concern to SJVEDC and HEAT as identified in Mr. Harriman's letter.

The first is policies that reflect a dedicated commitment on behalf of the City.

The State General Plan Guidelines state this about adequate policies:

"A policy is a specific statement that guides decision-making. It indicates a commitment of the local
a legislative body to a particular course of action."

"For a policy to be useful as guide to action it must be clear and unambiguous. Adopting broadly
drawn and vague policies is poor practice."

"When writing policies, be aware of the difference between "shall" and "should." "Shall" indicates an
unequivocal directive. "Should" signifies less rigid directive, to be honored in the absence of
compelling and contravening considerations. Use of the word "should" to give the impression of more
commitment than actually intended is a common but unacceptable practice. It is better to adopt no
policy than a policy with no backbone."

1

In many instances in the draft General Plan, and I will refer specifically to issues of concern of SJVEDC
and HEAT, policies are included that do not include the requisite commitment as directed by the General
Plan Guidelines.

A few quick examples are:

Transportation & Circulation Element Policy T43: "Promote Safe Routes to School programs for all
schools serving the city."

Open Space, Conservation & Recreation Element Policy 031:

"Where appropriate and feasible, establish permanent mechanisms to protect wetlands and riparian
corridors."

The second issue, which in many ways following from the first, is the lack of any implementation plan or
program as part of the General Plan update. Not only must a policy represent commitment on behalf of
the City, it must state the actions and programs the City intends to undertake to ensure that the policy
will be implemented.

In this regard, the State Guidelines state:

"A policy is carried out by implementation measures."

"An implementation measure is an action, procedure, or technique that carries out general plan policy.
Each policy must have at least one corresponding implementation measure."

With respect to the Open Space Element, the State has taken this a step further by requiring by statute
an implementation plan. Specifically, Government Code Section 65564 states: "Every local open-space
plan shall contain an action program consisting of specific programs which the legislative body intends
to pursue in implementing its open-space plan."

It is reported that your staff stated that they intend to prepare an implementation plan following the
adoption of the General Plan. However, the entire General Plan hierarchy of Goals, Objectives, Policies,
and Implementation Measures is intended to be considered and evaluated as whole how the City
plans to proceed from a broad vision to specific actions to achieve that vision.

Just as you need an adopted policy to determine appropriate implementation measures, you also need
to know how a policy is intended to be implemented in order to determine if a proposed policy is in fact
relevant, meaningful, appropriate, and of course, how it will be put into action. In other words, without knowing if and how a policy will be implemented, it brings into question whether the policy itself is
appropriate to be adopted and will serve its purpose to achieve the General Plan's goals and objectives.

In conclusion, based on the reasons stated above, it is my professional opinion that the proposed
General Plan is inadequate and should be referred back to your City Staff and consultants to make the

Hearing Date: April 18, 2017

Honorable Mayor Ayers and Council Members:

This office has been retained to submit the following requests on behalf of the San Joaquin Valley Environmental Defense Center (SJVEDC), a California non-profit corporation in good standing with the State of California (Corporation No. C3999627), having its principal
place of business in Visalia, California, and Hanford Environmental Awareness Team (HEAT), a California unincorporated association, having its principal place of business in Hanford, California, and a as a private attorney general, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.

Introduction

My clients have directed me to communicate the following information about their interests in the General Plan Update, as follows:
HEAT is committed to preserving Open Space to create walking and bike paths that connect residential and commercial zones throughout Hanford.

HEAT maintains public website, which bears this description on Facebook:

D

"Hanford Environmental Awareness Team (HEAT) advocates to make our community
one that people and corporations want to invest in.
HEAT supports sustainable economic development in our community while working with investors and developers to incorporate natural open spaces in their projects.
There are 95 members that "like" and follow HEAT as a city, county and community
movement.

After carefully reviewing and considering the proposed General Plan Update my clients and our consultants, including Douglas. McIsaac, along with his written comments, my clients and want to propose two specific implementation measures to implement the Land Use, Safety,
Conservation, and Open Space Elements.

Also, HEAT wishes to remind the City Council that, in its Memorandum of
Understanding of December 20, 2007, the City agreed to the following provision:

"6. In its consideration of applications for future development within the Project Area,
the City shall consider the Winterburg borrow pit in its alternative site analysis and
cumulative impacts anlaysis for the location of storm drainage basins in the environmental review of any and all proposed project developments proposed in the Project Area."

The "Project Area" included all of Reorganization No. 142, west of Centennial Drive,
west of the Super Target and Super Wal-Mart Shopping Center, north of the San Joaquin
Railroad (SJVR), Avenue 13, and south of W. Lacey. This area is included in the proposed
GPU. This area still contains Mussel Slough remnants and other natural water courses and
irrigation ditches and does not contain any publicly developed parks or Open Space, other than
the Mussel Slough Remnant Drainage Basin immediately to the west of the Super Wal-Mart
Shopping Center.

1. Amend the Master Bicycle and Trails Plan to Provide for Inter-connection
to All Developed Parks and Undeveloped OS

Both the General Plan Background Report [p. 4-16] and the General Plan Circulation
Map [p.64] show the proposed pedestrian and bicycle trail maps.

Transportation Element Policies PT65 and PT70 are set forth in the proposed General
Plan, as follow:

"Policy T65 Bicycle Network

Prioritize the elimination of gaps in the bicycle network to connect destinations across Hanford."

2

"Policy T70 Pedestrian Connections
Increase connectivity through direct and safe pedestrian connections to public amenities, neighborhoods, village centers and other destinations throughout the city."

Neither policy includes an Implementation Measure to provide for specific action within a
specific time period. Therefore, my clients request the following specific Implementation
Measure for both policies, as follows:

Implementation Measures:

"The City Council shall amend the General Plan to include the following Implementation Measure for PT 65 and PT 70: T

The General Plan Transportation Element shall be amended to provide that the Master Bicycle
and Trails Plan shall include interconnection between all developed parks and all undeveloped open space to provide public access to developed open space and undeveloped open space during all daytime hours for pedestrians and bicyclists.

This amendment of the General Plan shall, specifically, provide for pedestrian and bicyclist access from Centennial Drive and Millennial Drive to the north side of the Mussel Slough located to the west of the Super Wal-Mart Shopping Center and continuing to the north of the Winterburg borrow pit and west of 12 ½ Avenue to connect with the pedestrian-bicyclist trail which ends at Thirteenth Avenue and Front Street; and shall be completed within one year of the date of the final adoption of the GPU.

In addition, the City's Master Bicycle Master Plan and Trail Plan shall includes a pedestrian and
bicyclist trail around the Mussel Slough Basin to the western half of Hidden Valley Park, which
shall be developed into a public park or recreation area within one year of the date of the final
adoption of the GPU.

2. Amend the Biological Resources Element to Include Implementation Measures

My clients and I submitted a professional biologist's report in support of our comments that the existing 2002 General Plan has not provided adequate protection and preservation of the limited Endangered, Threatened, and Rare species of animals and plants and Species of Special Concern on the west side of Hanford and associated with the Mussel Slough. (James Paulus, PhD. 2007) Apparently, the photographs included and referred to in Dr. Paulus's report were not received and/or included in our comments on the Draft EIR. Therefore, we re-submitted the
complete report for your reference and for inclusion in the administrative record.

Based on Mr. McIssac's presentation submitted to your Council, my clients and I request that the Biological Portion of the General Plan (p. 84 et seq.) and Conservation and Open Space Elements be amended to include specific Implementation Measures designating what actions will

be undertaken to mitigate the adverse impacts to the remaining biological resources associated with the Conservation and Open Space resources that the City intends to preserve and protect within the Study Area designated by the GPU documents, including, without limitation, what restoration measures and actions the City intends to undertake to conserve the remaining
undeveloped OS resources and biological resources associated with them.

Thank you for the opportunity to present these final comments and requests for your review and consideration.

Respectfully submitted,

projects." (Id.) This requires a local lead agency to determine whether pollution from a proposed project will have significant effects on any nearby communities, when considered together with any pollution burdens those communities already are bearing, or may bear from probable future projects. Accordingly, the fact that an area already is polluted makes it more likely that any additional, unmitigated pollution will be significant. Where there already is a high
pollution burden on a community, the "relevant question" is "whether any additional amount" of
pollution "should be considered significant in light of the serious nature" of the existing problem.
(Hanford, supra, 221 Cal.App.3d at 661; see also Los Angeles Unified School Dist. v. City of Los Angeles (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1019, 1025 [holding that "the relevant issue ... is not the relative
amount of traffic noise resulting from the project when compared to existing traffic noise, but whether any additional amount of traffic noise should be considered significant in light of the serious nature of the traffic noise problem already existing around the schools."])

The Role of Social and Economic Impacts Under CEQA

Although CEQA focuses on impacts to the physical environment, economic and social effects may be relevant in determining significance under CEQA in two ways. (See CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15064, subd. (e), 15131.) First, as the CEQA Guidelines note, social or economic impacts may lead to physical changes to the environment that are significant. (ld. at §§ 15064, subd. (e), 15131, subd. (a).) To illustrate, if a proposed development project may cause economic harm to a community's existing businesses, and if that could in turn "result in business closures and physical deterioration" of that community, then the agency "should consider these problems to the extent that potential is demonstrated to be an indirect environmental effect of the proposed project." (See Citizens for Quality Growth v. City of Mt. Shasta (1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 433,
446.)

Second, the economic and social effects of physical change to the environment may be considered in determining whether that physical change is significant. (Id. at §§ 15064, subd. (e), 15131, subd. (b).) The CEQA Guidelines illustrate: "For example, if the construction of a new freeway or rail line divides an existing community, the construction would be the physical
change, but the social effect on the community would be the basis for determining that the effect would be significant." (Id. at § 15131, subd. (b); see also id. at § 15382 ("A social or economic change related to a physical change may be considered in determining whether the physical
change is significant."))

Alternatives and Mitigation
CEQA's "substantive mandate" prohibits agencies from approving projects with significant
environmental effects if there are feasible alternatives or mitigation measures that would substantially lessen or avoid those effects, (Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish and Game Commission (199T) 16 Cal.4th 105, 134.) Where a local agency has determined that a project may cause significant impacts to a particular community or sensitive subgroup, the alternative and mitigation analyses should address ways to reduce or eliminate the project's impacts to that community or subgroup. (See CEQA Guidelines, § 15041, subd. (a) [noting need for "nexus" between required changes and project's impacts].)
Depending on the circumstances of the project,the local agency may be required to consider alternative project locations (see Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of

Office of the California Attorney General Environmental Justice --Updated: 07/10/12

California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 404) or alternative project designs (see Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors (1988) 197 Cal.App.3d 1167, 1183) that could reduce or eliminate the effects of the project on the affected community,
The lead agency should discuss and develop mitigation in a process that is accessible to the public and the affected community. "Fundamentally, the development of mitigation measures, as envisioned by CEQA, is not meant to be a bilateral negotiation between a project proponent and the lead agency after project approval; but rather, an open process that also involves other interested agencies and the public." (Communities for a Better Environment v. City of Richmond (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 70, 93.) Further, "[mjitigation measures must be fully enforceable
through permit conditions, agreements, or other legally binding instruments." (CEQA
Guidelines, § 15126.4, subd. (a)(2).)

As part of the enforcement process, "[i]n order to ensure that the mitigation measures and project revisions identified in the EIR or negative declaration are implemented," the local agency must also adopt a program for mitigation monitoring or reporting. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15097, subd. (a).) "The purpose of these [monitoring and reporting] requirements is to ensure that
feasible mitigation measures will actually be implemented as a condition of development, and
not merely adopted and then neglected or disregarded." (Federation of Hillside and Canyon Assns.v. City of Los Angeles (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 1252, 1261.) Where a local agency adopts a a monitoring or reporting program related to the mitigation of impacts to a particular community or sensitive subgroup, its monitoring and reporting necessarily should focus on data from that community or subgroup.

Transpareney in Statements ofOverriding Consideration

Under CEQA, a local government is charged with the important task of "determining whether and how a project should be approved," and must exercise its own best judgment to "balance a variety of public objectives, including economic, environmental, and social factors and in
particular the goal of providing a decent home and satisfying living environment for every Californian.' (CEQA Guidelines, § 15021, subd. (d).) A local agency has discretion to approve a project even where, after application of all feasible mitigation, the project will have unavoidable adverse environmental impacts. (Id. at § 15093.) When the agency does however, it must be clear and transparent about the balance it has struck. so,

To satisfy CEQA's public information and informed decision making purposes, in making a statement of overriding considerations, the agency should clearly state not only the "specific
economic, legal, social, technological, or other benefits, including region-wide or statewide environmental benefits" that, in its view, warrant approval of the project, but also the project's "unavoidable adverse environmental effects[.]" (Id. at subd. (a).) If, for example, the benefits of the project will be enjoyed widely, but the environmental burdens of a project will be felt particularly by the neighboring communities, this should be set out plainly in the statement of overriding considerations.

Re: City of Hanford 2035 General Plan Update (GPU)
Objections to Proposed Zoning Ordinance
Resolution 17-04
Hearing Date: May 2, 2017

Honorable Mayor Ayers and Council Members:

As you have been previously informed, this office has been retained to submit the following requests on behalf of the San Joaquin Valley Environmental Defense Center (SJVEDC), a California non-profit corporation in good standing with the State of California
(Corporation No. C3999627), having its principal place of business in Visalia, California, and
Hanford Environmental Awareness Team (HEAT), a California unincorporated association, having its principal place of business in Hanford, California, and as a private attorney general, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.

Introduction

My clients and I have previously transmitted written objections to the legal adequacy of the proposed Hanford City General Plan 2035 and the proposed Final Environmental Impact Report ("FEIR"), as set forth in my letters of April 13, 2017 and April 18, 2017. However, my clients and I want to submit additional objections to the proposed Zoning Ordinance and Resolution No. 17-04, as follow:

1. General Plan Inadequacy

On page 2 of the proposed Zoning Ordinance, Section 17.02.060, the document
accurately states that the Zoning Ordinance must be consistent with the City General Plan.

In Resolution 17-04, Section 4, the document states:

"The City Council hereby finds that Municipal Code Amendment 2017-01, the
Zoning Ordinance Update and Zoning M are consistent with the Hanford General
Plan, as amended by Resolution 17-21-R."

My clients and I object to this finding on the grounds that the City cannot rely upon its legally inadequate General Plan 2035, adopted by Resolution 17-21-R, based on the reasons
previously presented in writing to the City Council prior to its approval of the General Plan and the Final EIR for the General Plan. One of the specific reasons that we objected to the adequacy of the new General Plan is the complete absence of Implementation Measures in the General
Plan.

Based on the reasons previously submitted to the Council, you cannot lawfully approve or adopt the proposed Municipal Code Amendment 2017-01.

2. Section 17.70.080 Improperly Denies the Public of Notice of Potentially
Significant Adverse Environmental Impacts under CEQA

At page 208, Section 17.70.070, in Table 17.70.070, the proposed Zoning Ordinance lists all Site Plan Review Permit applications as subject to "Non-Discretionary Applications."
Section 17.22 is identified in the Zoning Ordinance as controlling all Site Plan Review Permits. [Zoning Ordinance, at p. 214].

At page 209, Section 17.70.080 of the Zoning Ordinance states:

"…All non-discretionary applications are deemed to not be subject to environmental review, pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15268.3

As a result, irrespective of the size of the project or other environmental factors which
may be unique, due to the environmental setting or background and other characteristics of the project, there is no environmental review and no notice to the public, regarding the project or its potentially significant environmental impacts or effects.
Therefore, my clients and I object to the overly broad and vague "Site plan contents" set forth in Section 17.72.040 [pp. 215-216], on the ground that the items listed are insufficient and insufficiently specific to support a legal characterization of "non-discretionary" as to all of the
elements set forth and required.

In addition, we object on the grounds that this section violates the public's right to be provided notice and a reasonable opportunity to be heard and present evidence to the Site Plan Review Committee described in Section 17.72.030, because there is no notice whatsoever given to the public of the Site Plan Review hearings or decisions by the Director or the Site Plan

2

A

Review Committee. Consequently, the Site Plan Review process is fundamentally flawed and violates CEQA's provisions which define "failure to proceed in the manner required by law" and "abuse of discretion," pursuant to Public Resource Code sections 21168 and 21168.5.
A recent appellate case addresses this very issue and notes that the analysis of whether an administrative decision and action are discretionary depends upon and varies according to a number of factors which are not accounted for or addressed in Section 17.72.040. [See, Sierra Club v. County of Sonoma (Ohlson), filed April 21, 2017, in the First District Court of Appeal.and other cases cited therein.] In that case, the Court held against the Sierra Club, but thoroughly analyzes different cases and factors to be considered, in order to determine whether an administrative decision and action are discretionary.
However, the City's desire to declare all Site Plan Review decisions as "discretionary" does not end the inquiry. There may be, and usually are, other factors which are applicable, but may not be raised, due to the fact that the City, acting as the lead agency under CEQA, is not required to provide notice or disclosure to the public of the environmental issues that may arise, depending on the circumstances of the individual project. [See, also, Kings County Farm Bureau, V. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692] In that case, a coal-fired power generation plant was reviewed under a site plan review, and the Court held that the site plan review triggered an environmental review that resulted in an EIR being prepared and challenged. Similarly, one can readily imagine other environmentally sensitive settings along Mussel Slough, for example, that might require an environmental review document other than a Categorical Exemption. [See, for example, the file-marked copy of the Amended Petition and Complaint filed in the pending case entitled Hanford Environmental Awareness Team, et al. v. City of Hanford re Bajun American Properties, LP, et al. Kings County Superior Court Case No. 16C- 0208, which was previously provided for the record of proceedings. ]
a As a result, the City's exclusion of reasonable notice to the public during its Site Plan Review process violates the spirit and the letter of CEQA's full disclosure policy.
3. Inconsistency Between Sections Regarding Notice to the Public

Under Section 17.70.070 of the proposed City Zoning Ordinance, Administrative Use Permits are designated as "Non-Discretionary (p. 208). Hearings are identified and described in
Section 17.70.090. (p. 209)

However, when one examines Section 17.74.050, this section regulating Administrative Use Permits provides for Findings at Section 17.74.040 and for Notices of decision that must be mailed to each property owner within three hundred (300) feet of the subject property. This appears to be inconsistent with the Site Plan Review section previously objected to, based on the fact that the Site Plan Review Section no longer contains a provision which requires finding of consistency with the City General Plan, and there is no notice to adjacent land owners or to the public of the Site Plan Review application or decision, or any notice under CEQA .

In effect, the Site Plan Review procedure completely excludes the neighbors near and adjacent to the property subject to the SPR process; whereas, in the Administrative Use Permit section 17.74, neighbors do received notice and do have right to appeal and appear at appeals, pursuant to the provisions of Section 17.74.060.

Therefore, my clients and hereby object to the lack of due process and equal protection under the Site Plan Review provisions which deprive neighbors of reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard and to appeal the clandestine decision and action taken by the Director, and the lack of consistent notice and appeal rights as are provided for neighbors and the public
under the provisions of the Administrative Use Permit process, pursuant to CEQA and California Constitution Article 1, section 7(a)..

For the reasons presented above and based on our previous objections to the proposed General Plan 2035 and the FEIR for the General Plan, my clients and I request that your Council
not approve and adopt the Zoning Ordinance Resolution 17-04.

Thank you for the opportunity to present these final comments and requests for your
review and consideration.

Respectfully submitted,

Gentlepersons:

Please be informed that this office represents the legal interests of the San Joaquin Valley Environmental Defense Center, a California non-profit corporation, and the public interest of the residents of the City of Hanford, the County of Kings, and the San Joaquin Valley, in the above-
referenced matter.

Please take notice that my client will be filing suit against Respondent City of Hanford and the Hanford City Council, except Council member Susan Sorenson, who did not participate or vote in this matter, to vacate, set aside, void, rescind, and annul the City's decisions, findings, and actions approving the above-referenced decisions and actions. The decisions and actions include, the adoption and certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report (SCH No.
2015041024) for the above-referenced General Plan Update Project, and the approval and

P

adoption of the City of Hanford 2035General Plan Update (GPA 2017-02) and the Zoning Ordinance 17-02 (Resolution No. 17-04) referred to hereinabove.
Petitioner will seek a judgment, decree, and order commanding the City to prepare, notice, and circulate a legally adequate environmental review document for the above-referenced Project and the Zoning Ordinance, as required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The final decisions and actions were made and taken by the City on April 24, 2017 and
May 2, 2017 in reliance on the FEIR referred to above. The Notice of Determination was filed with the County Clerk on April 25, 2017.
This legal action will be based upon the failure to proceed in the manner required by law and to perform a proper environmental review, and to prepare a legally adequate environmental review document, for the above-referenced Project, pursuant to CEQA [PRC section 21000 et seq.] and the CEQA Guidelines [California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 14, Section 15000 et seq.]. In addition, Petitioner will be filing suit challenging the Project based on the legal inadequacy of the City's incomplete and inadequate General Plan Update, pursuant to the California Government Code, and based on the reliance on stale and out-dated data and information in the FEIR. The Zoning Ordinance will be challenged on the grounds that the FEIR is legally inadequate and was not prepared in a manner required by law and that the Zoning Ordinance fails to include implementation measures, includes internally inconsistent provisions, cannot be found consistent with the legally inadequate GPU, and such other grounds that are supported by the record of proceedings.
Please take further notice that Petitioner will be seeking an award of reasonable attorney's fees and costs from the City, pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 and
Government Code section 800.

Special written notice to the undersigned is hereby requested of any public hearing, meeting, or study session at which the City proposes to consider or deliberate taking action to revise, amend, or otherwise void, rescind, annul, vacate, and/or set aside the decisions, actions, and/or approvals referred to hereinabove and/or for any public hearing, public meeting, and/or study session to be held before the City Planning Director, Planning Commission, and/or the City Council to modify, change, or amend the above-referenced decisions, and/or actions for the
above-mentioned project entitlements or new ones for the subject project.
