27 Union of North America, Local Union 270 (hereinafter "Petitioners") petition this Court for a writ of

28 mandate directed to Respondents and Defendants City of San Jose, City Council for the City of San
Jose, and Planning Commission of the City of San Jose, (collectively "Respondents" or "City") and
1

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 Real Parties in Interest Salvatore Caruso and Salvatore Caruso Design Corporation ("Real Parties"

2 or "Applicant"), and by this verified petition and complaint, alleges as follows:

3 1. Petitioners bring this action to challenge the unlawful actions of Respondents in

4 approving the Dove Hill Medical Care Facility ("Project") without first preparing an Environmental

5 Impact Report ("EIR") in accordance with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality

6 Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq., and the CEQA Guidelines, title 14,

7 California Code of Regulations, § 15000 et seq. The specific actions challenged are: (1) the adoption

8 of Resolution No. 78838 adopting the Mitigated Negative Declaration ("IS/MND") and the

9 Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program for the Project; (2) the adoption of Ordinance No.

10 30176 rezoning the Project site from the A Agricultural Zoning District to the PQP(PD) Planned

11 Development Zoning District, and (3) the adoption of Resolution No. 78839 approving the Project.

12 2. The Project includes the demolition of approximately 25 existing structures and the

13 subsequent construction and operation of a medical care facility consisting of two buildings

14 containing 155 rooms and up to 248 beds. The Project's construction will directly impact

15 approximately 3 acres of a larger 21-acre parcel. The Project's western edge is immediately adjacent

16 to Highway 101. The adjacent 18-acres to the south, north and east of the site consist of undeveloped

17 land that will remain zoned A Agricultural Zoning District. Numerous ground squirrel burrows are

18 located adjacent to the Project site within this undeveloped area. At the top of the hillside is The

19 Ranch neighborhood, a development of single-family home residences.

20 3. Petitioners and others submitted evidence, including from several experts, presenting e

21 fair argument that the proposed Project may have significant wildlife and health risk impacts and that

22 the IS/MND's biological resources and health risks analyses are not supported by substantial

23 evidence. The City is in violation of CEQA by failing to prepare an EIR for the Project despite

24 substantial evidence in the record of a fair argument that:

25 a. the Project may have significant and unmitigated health risk impacts from the

26 cumulative emissions of toxic air contaminants from vehicles accessing the

27 Project, the Project's generators, and the adjacent highway, and;

28

2

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 b. the Project may have significant impacts on burrowing owls, California tiger

2 salamanders or their habitat.

3 4. Additionally, the IS/MND's analysis of these issues is not based upon substantial

4 evidence. Numerous ground squirrel burrows are located in close proximity to the site. Ground

5 squirrel burrows are important components of habitat utilized by burrowing owls and California tiger

6 salamanders. Despite the presence of ground squirrel burrows in areas adjacent to the site, and the

7 link between such burrows and the presence of burrowing owls and tiger salamanders, no surveys

8 targeting those two sensitive species were conducted by the Project. Additionally, the Project failed

9 to monitor for the presence of burrowing owls at the times of year when the species is most likely to

10 be present or nesting. As a result, the IS/MND failed to determine the baseline conditions at and near

11 the site for those two sensitive species. Without an adequate baseline, the actual potential significant

12 impacts of the Project cannot reasonably be evaluated.

13 5. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion in adopting the IS/MND and failing

14 to prepare an EIR. Alternatively, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by relying upon

15 an IS/MND that is not supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, the Resolutions approving the

16 IS/MND and approving the Project should be set aside and the City should be required to prepare an

17 EIR and fully comply with CEQA prior to considering whether to approve the Project.

18 PARTIES

19 6. Petitioner JOSÉ MEXICANO is a resident of San Jose. Mr. Mexicano frequently

20 visits the Ranch neighborhood adjacent to the Project site and enjoys the scenery and wildlife in the

21 vicinity. Mr. Mexicano is interested in ensuring that the City and Real Party fully comply with

22 CEQA to ensure that all environmental impacts are mitigated to the maximum extent feasible. Mr.

23 Mexicano submitted comments to Respondents objecting to and commenting on the Project and

24 requesting compliance with CEQA.

25 7. Petitioner ALEJANDRO MARTINEZ is a resident of San Jose. Mr. Martinez

26 frequently visits areas adjacent to the Project site and enjoys the scenery and wildlife in the vicinity.

27 Mr. Martinez is interested in ensuring that the City and Real Party fully comply with CEQA to ensure

28 that all environmental impacts are mitigated to the maximum extent feasible. Mr. Martinez submitted

3

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

comments to Respondents objecting to and commenting on the Project and requesting compliance

2 with CEQA.

3 8. Petitioner LABORERS INTERNATIONAL UNION OF NORTH AMERICA,

4 LOCAL UNION 270 ("LIUNA") is a labor organization that has approximately 4,300 members

5 residing in the County of Santa Clara. Local 270 has more than 3,400 members who live in the City

6 of San Jose. Local 270's purposes include advocating on behalf of its members to ensure safe

7 workplace environments; working to protect recreational opportunities for its members to improve its

8 members' quality of life when off the job; advocating to assure its members access to safe, healthful,

9 productive, and aesthetically and culturally pleasing surroundings on and off the job; promoting

10 environmentally sustainable businesses and development projects on behalf of its members, including

11 providing comments raising environmental concerns and benefits on proposed development projects;

12 advocating for changes to proposed development projects that will help to achieve a balance between

13 employment, the human population, and resource use to permit high standards of living and a wide

14 sharing of life's amenities by its members as well as the general public; advocating for steps to

15 preserve important historic, cultural, and natural aspects of our national heritage, and maintain,

16 wherever possible, an environment that supports diversity and variety of individual choice;

17 advocating on behalf of its members for programs, policies, and development projects that promote

18 not only good jobs but also a healthy natural environment and working environment, including

19 advocating for changes to proposed projects and policies that, if adopted, would reduce air, soil, and

20 water pollution, minimize harm to wildlife, conserve wild places, reduce traffic congestion, reduce

21 global warming impacts, and assure compliance with applicable land use ordinances; and working to

22 attain the widest range of beneficial uses of the environment without degradation, risk to health or

23 safety, or other undesirable or unintended consequences.

24 9. Local 270 and its members have a direct and beneficial interest in Respondents'

25 compliance with laws bearing upon approval of the Project. These interests will be directly and

26 adversely affected by the Project, which violates the law as set forth in this Petition. The maintenance

27 and prosecution of this action will confer a substantial benefit on the public by protecting the public

28 from the environmental and other harms alleged below and others that may exist but are unknown

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

due to the lack of a full environmental analysis. Local 270 and its members submitted written and

2 oral comments to the City's Planning Commission and the City Council objecting to and commenting

3 on the Project and its unsupported and inadequate environmental review pursuant to CEQA.

4 10. Respondent CITY OF SAN JOSE is the "lead agency" for the Project for purposes of

5 Public Resources Code § 21067, and has principal responsibility for conducting environmental

6 review for the Project and taking other actions necessary to comply with CEQA.

7 11. Respondent CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SAN JOSE is the governing body of

8 the City and is ultimately responsible for reviewing and approving or denying the IS/MND and the

9 Project.

10 12. Respondent and Defendant PLANNING COMMISSION OF THE CITY OF SAN

11 JOSE (*Planning Commission") is a commission of the City of San Jose, which reviews and takes

12 action on certain planning applications and accompanying environmental review documents prepared

13 pursuant to CEQA. The Planning Commission voted on July 25, 2018 to approve the IS/MND and

14 the Project.

15 13. On October 24, 2018, the City filed a Notice of Determination with the Office of the

16 County Clerk-Recorder for the County of Santa Clara. The Notice of Determination identified

17 "Salvatore Caruso" and "Salvatore Caruso Design Corporation" as the applicants for the Project. Cal.

18 Public Resources Code section 21167.6.5(a) requires that a petitioner or plaintiff "shall name, as a

19 real party in interest, the person or persons identified by the public agency in its notice...." Cal. Pub.

20 Res. Code § 21167.6.5.

21 •14. Real Party in Interest SALVATORE CARUSO DESIGN CORPORATION is a

22 California corporation. Real Party in Interest SALVATORE CARUSO DESIGN CORPORATION's

23 principle office is located in Santa Clara. Real Party in Interest SALVATORE CARUSO DESIGN
24 CORPORATION is the applicant for the Project.

25 15. Real Party in Interest SALVATORE CARUSO is identified in the City's Notice of

26 Determination dated October 24, 2018. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege,

27 that Mr. Caruso is the Chief Executive Officer, a Director, and the Registered Agent for Salvatore

28 Caruso Design Corporation.

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

16. Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 (alternatively section
1085) and Public Resources Code sections 21168 (alternatively section 21168.5) and 21168.9, this

4 Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandate to set aside Respondents' decision to approve the
Project without proper CEQA review. The Court has jurisdiction to issue declaratory relief pursuant

6 to Code of Civil Procedure § 1060 and injunctive relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 525 et

7 seq.

17. Venue is proper in this Court because this action challenges acts done by a public
agency, and the causes of action alleged in this Petition and Complaint arose in the County of Santa

10 Clara. Venue also is proper in this Court because the City is located in the County of Santa Clara.

11 18. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

12 21167.5 by serving on November 8. 2018 a written notice of Petitioners' intention to commence this

13 action against Respondents. A copy of the written notice is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

14 19. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
15 21167.6 by filing a notice of its election to prepare the record of administrative proceedings relating

16 to this action. A copy of the notice is attached hereto as Exhibit B.

17 20. Petitioners will comply with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
18 21167.7 by sending a copy of this Petition and Complaint to the California Attorney General.

19 21. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this instant action

20 and have exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.
21 22. Petitioners have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
22 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to prepare an EIR or

23 other legally adequate CEQA document for the Project and enjoins the City from approving the
24 Project pending completion of legally adequate CEQA review. In the absence of such remedies,

25 Respondents' decision will remain in violation of state law.

26 LEGAL BACKGROUND

27 23. CEQA has two primary purposes. First, CEQA is designed to inform decision makers
28 and the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of a project. (14 Cal. Code Regs.

6

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

("CEQA Guidelines") § 15002(a)(1)). Second, CEQA requires public agencies to avoid or reduce

2 environmental damage when "feasible" by requiring "environmentally superior" alternatives and all

3 feasible mitigation measures. (CEQA Guidelines 15002(a)(2) and (3)).

24. CEQA requires that an agency analyze the potential environmental impacts of its
proposed actions in an EIR except in certain limited circumstances. (See Pub. Resources Code, §
21100.) The EIR is the very heart of CEQA. (Bakersfield Citizens for Local Control v. City of

7 Bakersfield (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1184, 1214; Pocket Protectors V. City of Sacramento (2004) 124
Cal.App.4th 903, 927.) The EIR is an "environmental 'alarm bell' whose purpose is to alert the

9 public and its responsible officials to environmental changes before they have reached the ecological

10 points of no return." (Bakersfield Citizens, 124 Cal.App.4th at 1220.) The EIR also functions as a

11 "document of accountability," intended to "demonstrate to an apprehensive citizenry that the agency

12 has, in fact, analyzed and considered the ecological implications of its action." (Laurel Heights

13 Improvements Assn. v. Regents of University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392.) The EIR

14 process "protects not only the environment but also informed self-government." (Pocket Protectors,

15 124 Cal.App.4th at 927.)

16 25. An EIR is required if "there is substantial evidence, in light of the whole record before

17 the lead agency, that the project may have a significant effect on the environment." (Pub. Resources

18 Code, § 21080(d); see also Pocket Protectors, 124 Cal.App.4th at 927.) This evidentiary standard is

19 generally referred to as the "fair argument" standard.

20 26. "Significant environmental effect" is defined very broadly as "a substantial or

21 potentially substantial adverse change in the environment." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21068; see also

22 CEQA Guidelines, § 15382.) An effect on the environment need not be "momentous" to meet the

23 CEQA test for significance; it is enough that the impacts are "not trivial." (No Oil, Inc. V. City of Los

24 Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 83.)

25 27. Under the "fair argument" standard, an EIR is required if any substantial evidence in

26 the record indicates that a project may have an adverse environmental effect-even if contrary

27 evidence exists to support the agency's decision. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15064(f)(1); Pocket

28 Protectors, 124 Cal.App.4th at 931; Stanislaus Audubon Society v. County of Stanislaus (1995) 33

7

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

Cal.App.4th 144, 150-15; Quail Botanical Gardens Found., Inc. v. City of Encinitas (1994) 29

2 Cal.App.4th 1597, 1602.) The "fair argument" standard creates a "low threshold" favoring
environmental review through an EIR rather than through issuance of negative declarations or notices

4 of exemption from CEQA. (Pocket Protectors, 124 Cal.App.4th at 928.) "[I]t is question of law,
not fact, whether a fair argument exists, and the courts owe no deference to the lead agency's

6 determination. Review is de novo, with a preference for resolving doubts in favor of environmental

7 review." (Pocket Protectors, 124 Cal.App.4th at 928.)
28. "[U]nder CEQA, the lead agency bears a burden to investigate potential environmental
impacts. "If the local agency has failed to study an area of possible environmental impact, a fair

10 argument may be based on the limited facts in the record. Deficiencies in the record may actually

11 enlarge the scope of fair argument by lending a logical plausibility to a wider range of inferences.'

12 (Sundstrom v. County of Mendocino (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 296, 311. County Sanitation Dist. No. 2

13 V, County of Kern (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1544.)

14 29. In limited circumstances, an agency may avoid preparing an EIR by issuing a negative
15 declaration but only if there is not even a "fair argument" that the project will have a significant

16 environmental effect. (14 Cal. Code Regs., § 15371 ["CEQA Guidelines"]; Pub. Resources Code, §§

17 21100, 21064.) Since "[t]he adoption of a negative declaration has a terminal effect on the

18 environmental review process," by allowing the agency "to dispense with the duty [to prepare an

19 EIR]," negative declarations are allowed only in cases where "the proposed project will not affect the

20 environment at all." (Citizens of Lake Murray v. San Diego (1989) 129 Cal.App.3d 436, 440.) A
21 mitigated negative declaration is proper only if the project revisions would avoid or mitigate the

22 potentially significant effects identified in the initial study "to a point where clearly no significant

23 effect on the environment would occur, and…there is no substantial evidence in light of the whole

24 record before the public agency that the project, as revised, may have a significant effect on the
25 environment." (Pub. Resources Code §§ 21064.5 and 21080(c)(2); Mejia v. City of Los Angeles

26 (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 322, 331.) In that context, "may" means a reasonable possibility of a

27 significant effect on the environment. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21082.2(a), 21100, 21151(a); Pocket

28

8

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 Protectors, 124 Cal.App.4th at 927; League for Protection of Oakland's etc. Historic Resources v.

2 City of Oakland (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 896, 904-905.)

3 30. As a matter of law, "substantial evidence includes .. . expert opinion." (Pub.

4 Resources Code, § 21080(e)(1); CEQA Guidelines, § 15064(f)(5).) CEQA Guidelines demand that

5 where experts have presented conflicting evidence on the extent of the environmental effects of a

6 project, the agency must consider the environmental effects to be significant and prepare an EIR.

7 (CEQA Guidelines $ 15064(f)(5); Pub. Res. Code § 21080(e)(1); Pocket Protectors, 124 Cal.App.4th

8 at 935.)

9 31. A negative declaration must accurately describe the proposed project and its

10 environmental setting. (Christward Ministry v. Superior Court (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 180; CEQA

11 Guidelines §15071(a).) The initial study must "provide documentation of the factual basis for the

12 finding in a Negative Declaration that a project will not have significant effect on the environment."

13 (CEQA Guidelines § 15063(c)(5).)

14 32. CEQA Guidelines §15065(a) provides that:

15 A lead agency shall find that a project may have a significant effect on the environment
16 and thereby require an EIR to be prepared for the project where there is substantial evidence, in light of the whole record, that any of the following conditions may occur:
17 (1) The project has the potential to substantially degrade the quality of the environment;

18 substantially reduce the habitat of a fish or wildlife species; cause a fish or wildlife population to drop below self-sustaining levels; threaten to eliminate a plant or animal

19 community; substantially reduce the number or restrict the range of an endangered, rare or threatened species; or eliminate important examples of the major periods of California
20 history or prehistory.

21 33. Except where CEQA or the CEQA Guidelines tie CEQA analysis to planning done for

22 a different purpose (see, e.g., § 21081.2, subd. (a) [CEQA findings on traffic impacts not required for

23 certain residential infill projects that are in compliance with other municipal plans and ordinances]),

24 an EIR must be judged on its fulfillment of CEQA's mandates, not those of other statutes. (See
25 Neighbors for Smart Rail v. Exposition Metro Line Constr. Auth. (2013) 57 Cal.4th 439, 462.) A

26 habitat conservation plan itself does not satisfy CEQA. (Envtl. Council of Sacramento v. City of

27 Sacramento (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1018, 1027.)

28

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 34. For those species actually addressed by a habitat conservation plan, the Project is not

2 bound to implement mitigation requirements established by the Santa Clara Valley Habitat Plan

3 (*VHP") for burrowing owl, California tiger salamander, and red-legged frog. Where a Project is not is

4 bound to implement mitigation requirements for species, the presence of a HCP would not affect

5 the scope of any CEQA review or mitigation.

6 35. The EIR prepared for the VHP acknowledges that the VHP is not a stand-in for

7 project-level CEQA review. As the FEIR for the VHP states, "[a]s part of the standard approval

8 process, most projects would require separate, project-level environmental review under CEQA."

9 VHP FEIR, p. 2-7. See also id. (Response to Comment 50-66) ("The commenter is correct that

10 project-level CEQA review will still be necessary with the adoption of the [VHP]").

11 STATEMENT OF FACTS

12 36. The Project is proposed to be located on roughly 3-acre portion of a 21-acre site

13 located at 4200 Dove Hill Road in San Jose. The Project would be located immediately adjacent to

14 U.S. Highway 101. Currently, the 3-acre site contains a two-story, single-family home, a secondary

15 living unit shed, and number of storage and garage sheds. The Project proposes to rezone three

16 acres of the 21-acre site from Agriculture to A(PD) Planned Development. The remaining 18-acres of

17 the site would remain private open space currently zoned for agriculture and consisting of grassland

18 being used as pasture for horses.

19 37. The Project proposes to demolish all existing buildings, structures, trees and

20 landscaping, and associated improvements within the 3-acre development footprint. The Project

21 includes the construction and operation of a convalescent hospital facility with two buildings

22 containing a total of 155 patient rooms and up to 248 beds. The proposed Project also would include

23 a dining hall, multipurpose room and other ancillary uses, surface parking areas, new landscaping,

24 walkways, and landscaped common outdoor open space. Each of the two hospital buildings would

25 contain a back-up diesel generator. The Project would result in an increase of about 759 vehicle trips

26 per day.

27 38. The Project will be bordered on its northern and eastern sides by existing grassland.

28 Expert biologist Shawn Smallwood, Ph.D., observed numerous ground squirrel burrows located on

10

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

the adjacent hillside in proximity to the Project's development footprint. In 2015, H.T. Harvey &

2 Associates also had reported the presence of numerous ground squirrel burrows adjacent to the site.
This report was made during a survey for adult Bay checkerspot butterflies (Euphydryas editha

4 bayensis) conducted on March 31, 2015.

39. Despite the presence of numerous ground squirrel burrows, the IS/MND states that the

6 site has a paucity of burrows of California ground squirrel.
The IS/MND Does Not Include a Baseline That has Determined

8 Whether Burrowing Owls are Present at or Near the Site.

40. Burrowing owls are a sensitive bird species in California. Burrowing owls are on the

10 verge of extirpation from the San Francisco Bay Area. The Santa Clara Valley region harbors most of

11 the remaining breeding pairs. As of two years ago, breeding pairs in Santa Clara Valley numbered 37,

12 and the situation is worse now.

13 41. In order to determine the absence of burrowing owls from project site requires a

14 survey to be conducted consistent with survey standards published by the California Department of

15 Fish & Wildlife ("CDFW*). Such surveys have not been performed on the project site. Three

16 reconnaissance-level surveys for wildlife were conducted about a decade ago on September 12, 2008,

17 September 21, 2008, and February 9 2009. Neither the IS/MND nor the biological report

18 accompanying the IS/MND provides any details about the conduct of these surveys, such as when

19 they began, how long they lasted, and what methods were used. None of these three surveys

20 occurred during the burrowing owl breeding season. None of the surveys were conducted consistent

21 with the survey methodologies identified in the available survey guidelines published by CDFW.

22 42. Although unsubstantiated with relevant field surveys, the IS/MND asserts that there is

23 no nesting habitat for burrowing owls on or in the vicinity of the Project site. Dr. Smallwood's

24 comments explain that this assertion is speculative given that the limited surveys performed by the

25 City's consultant were not consistent with the requirements necessary to effectively survey for

26 burrowing owls established by CDFW. Dr. Smallwood also explains that the IS/MND's focus on

27 nesting or breeding habitat totally ignores the likely presence of foraging habitat adjacent to the

28 project site. As Dr. Smallwood notes, "losing access to forage results directly in losing access to
breeding opportunity."
11

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

43. Dr. Smallwood submitted comments describing his observations and opinions

2 regarding a visit he made to the Project site on August 25, 2018. Based on his visit to the site, Dr.
Smallwood has confirmed that numerous ground squirrel burrows are located adjacent to the Project

4 site. Such burrows are commonly used by burrowing owls and indicate there is a likelihood that

5 burrowing owls may be present at or adjacent to the Project site, especially during their nesting

6 season. Contrary to Dr. Smallwood's observations and expert comments, the IS/MND claims

7 "[t]here is low probability of occurrence of the burrowing owl, a California species of special
concern, on the site due to the paucity of California ground squirrel burrows." Dr. Smallwood's
observations directly refute that there is a "paucity" of ground squirrel burrows directly adjacent to

10 the Project site.

11 There Is A Fair Argument Based on Substantial Evidence That The Project May Have

12 Significant Impacts on the California Tiger Salamander and Red-Legged Frog.

13 44. California tiger salamanders require upland refugia. A California tiger salamander was

14 found only 1,200 meters east of the project site several months ago. Tiger salamanders have been

15 observed to disperse to upland refugia up to 2.2 km from breeding ponds. That distance far exceeds

16 the 1,200 m distance between the project site and the recently observed California tiger salamander.

17 The degradation of refugia for these species directly affects the prospects of the species successfully

18 breeding.

19 45. Red-legged frogs also depend on upland refugia during the non-breeding season. The

20 grasslands of the Project site could very well be important refuge and crossover habitat used by

21 California tiger salamander and California red-legged frog.

22 46. The IS/MND did not conclude that these species are absent from upland habitat at the

23 site. According to the IS/MND, "[t]he Habitat Plan maps the site as providing potential non-breeding

24 habitat for the California tiger salamander and potential dispersal habitat for the California red-legged

25 frog. The IS/MND nevertheless states that "[n]o waterbodies providing suitable breeding habitat for

26 the California tiger salamander or California red-legged frog are present on or immediately adjacent

27 to the site; therefore, they are not expected to occur." The absence of waterbodies is not an indication

28 that upland habitat is not dispersal habitat for California tiger salamanders or California red-legged
frogs. Without having performed any type of survey suitable for detecting California tiger
12

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

salamanders or California red-legged frogs in upland refugia, the IS/MND cannot claim to know

2 whether the site supports refugia for these species or evaluate the potential impacts of the Project on

3 the potential adjacent upland refugia habitat.

4 47. Dr. Smallwood observed the pathways that remain between a known salamander

5 location and the Project site and noted the likelihood that salamanders would be moving through the

6 site to access the numerous ground squirrel burrows on the adjacent hillside. The burrows adjacent to

7 the Project site observed by Dr. Smallwood are the type of burrows utilized by California tiger

8 salamanders as upland habitat and are accessible to tiger salamanders documented near the site.

9 The IS/MND's Speculative Discussion of Impacts to Bats

10 48. A number of special status bat species are expected to occur at and adjacent to the

11 Project site. These include the Western red bat and the pallid bat. Both species are identified by

12 CDFW as Species of Special Concern. Special-status species of bats are not covered by the incidental

13 take permit issued to participants with the Santa Clara County Valley Habitat Plan.

14 49. Although a few bat species were given potential for occurrence due to buildings on

15 site that could serve as roosts, no surveys were performed to detect bats. Dr. Smallwood confirms the

16 availability of acoustic monitoring and thermal imaging monitoring for detecting and identifying bat

17 species. No acoustic monitoring for bats was conducted for the Project. No thermal-imaging surveys

18 for bats were conducted for the Project. Detection surveys are needed, because detection surveys

19 provide the bases for impacts assessments and formulation of mitigation measures.

20 50. Instead of accurately describing the environmental setting of the proposed Project

21 relevant to the presence of bats at and adjacent to the site, the IS/MND and Mitigation Measures MM

22 BIO-3.1 through MM BIO-3.3 assume that preconstruction surveys for bats would be sufficient to

23 mitigate harm to any bats that may be present. Dr. Smallwood provides expert opinion that

24 preconstruction surveys would come too late to reduce project impacts on bats. Preconstruction

25 surveys for bats do not reduce impacts but at best only salvage readily detectable animals in

26 immediate peril of destruction by heavy machinery. Preconstruction surveys would come too late to

27 reduce project impacts on bats.

28 The IS/MND's Speculative Assurance That the Project Will Have Less Than
Significant Impacts on Loggerhead Shrike and White-Tailed Kite
13

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 51. The IS/MND does not provide documentation of the factual basis for its finding that

2 the Project will not have a significant effect on loggerhead strikes and white-tailed kites. Loggerhead

3 strikes are identified by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as a Bird of Conservation Concern. White-

4 tailed kites are a fully-protected species under Fish and Game Code § 3511(b)(12). White-tailed kites

5 also are a protected raptor species pursuant to F&G Code 3503.5 and have been placed on the taxa to

6 watch list by CDFW. Neither loggerhead strikes nor white-tailed kites are covered by the VHP.

7 52. The IS/MND relies on speculation that loss of these species at the Project site would

8 not be significant because it would be a small percentage of these species' respective populations.

9 The IS/MND does not present any information on local populations of loggerhead shrike or white-

10 tailed kite or their spatial boundaries. The IS/MND arbitrarily limits its discussion of impacts to

11 nesting habitat for these two species of concern. The IS/MND does not consider impacts of the

12 Project on the birds' foraging habitat. Dr. Smallwood explains that, even if white-tailed kites and

13 loggerhead shrikes do not nest on site, they most likely forage on site and their foraging there helps

14 sustain their nesting efforts elsewhere. Dr. Smallwood's review of the biological report prepared for

15 the IS/MND confirms that the discussion of loggerhead strikes and white-tailed kites was based on

16 speculation and not supported by any evidence.

17 53. Instead of accurately describing the environmental setting of the proposed Project

18 relevant to white-tailed kites and loggerhead shrikes, the IS/MND and Mitigation Measure MM BIO-

19 2.1 assume that preconstruction surveys for those two bird species would be sufficient to mitigate

20 harm to any such birds that may be present. Dr. Smallwood provides expert opinion that
21| preconstruction surveys would come too late to reduce project impacts on white-tailed kites and

22 loggerhead shrikes. Preconstruction surveys for white-tailed kites and loggerhead shrikes do not

23 reduce impacts but at best only salvage readily detectable animals in immediate peril of destruction

24 by heavy machinery. Prereconstruction surveys would come too late to reduce project impacts on

25 white-tailed kites and loggerhead shrikes.

26 The IS/MND Lacks Any Analysis of Potential Impacts to

27 Sensitive Bird Species Observed by Dr. Smallwood at the Site.

28 54. Dr. Smallwood observed several other sensitive bird species including Cooper's hawk,
red-tailed hawk, and Common yellowthroat foraging and flying at or adjacent to the Project site. The

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

IS/MND makes no mention of the potential impacts the Project may have to foraging and other

2 habitat of these sensitive bird species. The IS/MND for the Project does not address potential impacts

3 to Cooper's hawk, red-tailed hawk, or San Francisco common yellowthroat. The Cooper's hawk, red-

4 tailed hawk and San Francisco common yellowthroat are not covered by the VHP. Accordingly, no

5 CEQA review of the Project's impacts to these three species has been done.

6 The IS/MND Lacks Any Analysis of Potential Road-Kill Impacts

7 55. Vehicle collisions have accounted for the deaths of many thousands of reptile,

8 amphibian, mammal, bird, and arthropod fauna, and the impacts have often been found to be
significant at the population level. Increased use of existing roads will increase wildlife fatalities. In

10 2017, one of the major hotspots of road-killed wildlife identified by the UC Davis Road Ecology

11 Center overlaps the project site.

12 56. The IS/MND fails to analyze the impacts of the project's added road traffic on special-

13 status species of wildlife, including species such as Alameda whipsnake (Masticophis lateralis

14 euryxanthus), California red-legged frog (Rana draytonit), California tiger salamander (Ambystoma

15 californiense), and other species that, regardless of whether they live on the site, must cross roadways

16 that will experience increased traffic volume caused by this project. The IS/MND provided no

17 analysis of impacts on wildlife that will be caused by increased traffic on roadways servicing the

18 project. The IS/MND estimates a daily trip generation of about 700 resulting from the project, but

19 makes no effort to relate this trip generation to wildlife injuries and fatalities that will be caused by

20 collisions and crushing. The project's added traffic impacts on wildlife need to be assessed to the

21 extent that the project's added traffic is reasonably expected to travel from the project site.

22 Reliance on Santa Clara Valley Habitat Plan as Stand-in for Determining

23 the Environmental Setting at the Site

24 57. The IS/MND relies on the VHP as justifying staff's reliance on imprecise,

25 reconnaissance level surveys to determine the presence of sensitive wildlife species. The IS/MND

26 and staff responses to comments treat the a VHP as a stand-in for an investigation of the site and

27 surrounding hillside for the presence of burrowing owls, California tiger salamanders, red-legged

28 frogs, and other species and serves to mitigate any potential biological impacts from the Project.

15

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

58. The only regulatory requirements the VHP assists in streamlining is the need for

2 individual project's to obtain incidental take permits under the federal and state endangered species

3 acts. Nothing in the VHP relieves the City from any requirement or duty to investigate a project site

4 under CEQA.

59. Many species which may be adversely affected by the Project are not addressed by the

6 VHP. These include white-tailed kites, loggerhead shrikes, Pallid bats, Western red bats, Cooper's

7 hawks, red-tailed hawks and San Francisco common yellowthroats.

8 60. Burrowing owls, California tiger salamanders, and red-legged frogs are included in the
VHP. For those species covered by the VHP, the environmental setting as pertains to those species

10 must still be accurately described in the IS/MND and affects considered. The IS/MND does not rely

11 on any evidence establishing that the VHP will mitigate the Project's potential impacts to covered

12 species. The IS/MND does not refer to any evidence that the requirements of the VHP avoid any net

13 loss of habitat or net reduction in number of burrowing owls, California tiger salamanders, or red-

14 legged frogs. No fees relevant to burrowing owls, California tiger salamanders, or red-legged frogs

15 are proposed to be paid as mitigation for any impacts to these species pursuant to the VHP.

16 Additionally, the IS/MND does not refer to any evidence that the VHP's requirements will preserve,

17 restore, or enhance sufficient habitat to mitigate the reduction in habitat and the number of the

18 affected species to below a level of significance for these covered species. Indeed, Dr. Smallwood

19 provides expert evidence that the VHP is not achieving its goal of stabilizing and increasing species

20 covered by the Plan because, for example, the population of burrowing owls in the Santa Clara
21 Valley continues to grow smaller and closer to eradication in the region.

22 The IS/MND's Unsubstantiated Greenhouse Gas Evaluation

23 61. The IS/MND claims that because the Project is consistent with the mandatory

24 requirements of the City's GHG Reduction Strategy ("GHGRS"), it will not have any significant

25 impacts from its GHG emissions. IS/MND, pp. 82-85. The IS/MND does not identify the Project's

26 actual GHG mitigation measures. Most of the measures adopted for the Project will have little

27 relevance to GHG reductions. For example, the IS/MND relies on "enhanc[ing] the pedestrian

28 environment with new sidewalks" as a GHG measure. However, the Project is isolated from other

16

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

neighborhoods and amenities and abuts a freeway and will focus on assisting convalescent patients.

2 No evidence shows that improving sidewalks near this Project would significantly enhance a

3 pedestrian environment in such a way as to reduce any GHG emissions. No estimate or prediction of

4 any people walking to the facility is suggested in the IS/MND. Convalescing patients and their guests

5 will not be leaving and arriving at the Project on foot.

6 62. The IS/MND claims that if the Project is consistent with the General Plan's

7 Public/Quasi-Public land use designation for the site, that fact somehow will control GHG emissions.

8 There is no evidence that this is true for a large convalescent facility to be built in an isolated open

9 space area surrounded by unrelated residential development. No rationale is provided in the IS/MND

10 of how this particular land use designation serves to reduce any GHG emissions.

11 63. The IS/MND does not discuss or quantify how a convalescent hospital's inclusion of

12 bicycle and pedestrian facilities will meaningfully reduce GHG emissions at such an isolated facility

13 with little relevance to the surrounding neighborhoods.

14 64. The IS/MND claims that the Project will comply with certain components of the GHG

15 Reduction Strategy, including "Implementation of Green Building Measures related to: • Solar Site

16 Orientation • Site Design Architectural Design • Construction Techniques • Consistency with City

17 Green Building Ordinance and Policies • Consistency with GHGRS Policies: MS-2.3, MS-2.11, and

18 MS-14.4." IS/MND, p. 83. The referenced GHGRS policies represent a laundry list of possible

19 design and construction measures a project may utilize. The measures however do not say which ones

20 will be used for this Project or how they would be implemented for this Project. None of the general
21 admonitions to employ green building components in designing a project indicates or explains how
22 the Project will employ such techniques or whether the existing design includes any such

23 components.

24 65. The IS/MND does not indicate how water efficiency is promoted by the landscaping

25 proposed for the Project. Indeed, the Project proposes to use 931,258 gallons of water per day. Only

26 28,365 gallons of that would be for the Project's indoor use. Compared to the current estimated

27 water use of the site at approximately 1,213 gallons of water per day, there is nothing in the IS/MND

28 to suggest some effective water conservation strategy, drought resistant landscaping or any other

17

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

measure that would actually reduce GHGs. The IS/MND does not explain how the City's compliance

2 with GHGRS Policy MS-21.3 which calls on the City to " [e]nsure that San José's Community Forest

3 is comprised of species that have low water requirements and are well adapted to its Mediterranean

4 climate" is either relevant to the Project or guides any particular vegetation at the Project.

5 66. The site selection for the Project has nothing to do with promoting GHG reductions or

6 energy efficiency, amounting to an almost random opportunity to replace a somewhat degraded site

7 with a type of project generally deemed beneficial and in demand. No other details about materials,

8 design or any other aspect of the Project indicate how it will further the referenced green building

9 examples or achieve any particular LEED rating.

10 67. The Project does not include the installation of solar panels.

11 68. Rather than reduce traffic by reducing parking, the Project proposes to increase

12 parking above the City's minimum requirements. Id.

13 69. The IS/MND states that pursuant to the City's Private Sector Green Building Policy,

14 "the proposed project would be required to be LEED Certified." However, the Private Sector Green

15 Building Policy actually requires this Project to be certified LEED Silver.
16 http://www.sanjoseca.gov/index.aspx?NID=3284 ("Commercial/Industrial Tier 2 - ≥ 25,000 square

17 feet = LEED Silver"). The various LEED certification levels are based on a point system. The

18 IS/MND does not explain the LEED point system. Nothing in the IS/MND explains what features the

19 Project would claim to justify whatever points may be available to the Project in the LEED system.

20 The City's ordinance does not guarantee that even a large commercial project such as the proposed

21 Project will necessarily achieve LEED Silver because it provides for Project specific exemptions at

22 the discretion of the Director of Planning. § 17.84.210. As a result, no reader of the IS/MND and its

23 attachments can be sure what compliance with the City's Green Building Ordinance may look like for
24 this Project.

25 PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

26 70. On or about July 1, 2016, the applicant submitted an application to the City for the

27 Project.

28

18

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

71. From April 9, 2018 throug April 30, 2018, the IS/MND for the Project was circulated

2 for public review.

3 72. On April 30, 2018, LIUNA submitted written comments on the IS/MND and the
Project, including expert comments prepared by Dr. Smallwood and environmental consulting firm
SWAPE.

6 73. On or about July 9, 2018, LIUNA received a public hearing notice for the San Jose

7 Department of Planning, Building and Code Enforcement stating that a hearing on the IS/MND and

8 project would be held before the San Jose Planning Commission on July 25, 2018 at 6:30 p.m. and
that a subsequent hearing on the IS/MND and Project would be held before the City Council on

10 August 28, 2018 at 6:00 p.m.

11 74. On or about July 24, 2018, the San Jose Department of Planning, Building and Code

12 Enforcement released responses to comments submitted on the IS/MND.

13 75. On July 25, 2018, the San Jose Planning Commission held a public hearing on the

14 Project. LIUNA made oral comments at the Planning Commission hearing. At the conclusion of the

15 hearing, the Planning Commission voted to recommend that the City Council adopt the IS/MND and

16 approve the Project.

17 76. On August 28, 2018, at about 1:00 p.m., LIUNA submitted supplemental comments

18 on the IS/MND to the City Council via e-mail. LIUNA's comments attached further comments

19 prepared by Dr. Smallwood.

20 77. On August 28, 2018, the City Council held a hearing on the IS/MND and Project.
21 LIUNA appeared at the hearing, submitted copies of the supplemental comments that had been e-

22 mailed to the Council earlier in the day, and made oral comments to the Council on the IS/MND

23 Project. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Council decided to continue the matter for two weeks.

24 78. On or about September 11, 2018, the City issued a notice further continuing its
25 consideration of the Project until September 25, 2018. LIUNA attended the September 25, 2018 City

26 Council meeting. On September 25, 2018, at the beginning of the City Council meeting, the Council

27 announced that the matter would be further continued until October 23, 2018.

28

19

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

79. On September 25, 2018, Petitioners José Mexicano and Alejandro Martinez submitted

2 written comments to the City Council and Planning Department joining in the comments previously

3 submitted by LIUNA.

4 80. On October 23, 2018, the City Council took up consideration of the Project. LIUNA

5 made oral comments on the Project at the October 23, 2018 meeting. Despite the existence of

6 substantial evidence creating a fair argument that the Project may result in significant adverse

7 environmental impacts, the City Council adopted Resolution No. 78838 approving the IS/MND and

8 Mitigation and Monitoring Program. The City Council also adopted Ordinance No. 30176 rezoning

9 the site and Resolution No. 78839 approving the Project.

10 81. On October 24, 2018, the City filed a Notice of Determination with the Santa Clara

11 County Clerk's office. This action is being filed within 30 days of the posting of the City's Notice of

12 Determination with the Santa County Clerk's office, in accordance with Public Resources Code

13 section 21167(b).

14 82. Petitioners exhausted administrative remedies by submitting written and oral

15 comments and expert analysis to the Respondents demonstrating that there is a fair argument that the

16 Project may have adverse environmental impacts and requesting preparation of an EIR to analyze

17 these impacts and to propose feasible mitigation measures. Despite being presented with this

18 substantial evidence, Respondents failed to prepare an EIR.

19 83. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law

20 within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure § 1094.5 or, alternatively, § 1086, in that

21 Respondents' approval of the Project is not otherwise reviewable in a manner that provides an

22 adequate remedy. Accordingly, Petitioners seek this Court's review of Respondents' approval of the

23 Project to rectify the violations of CEQA.

24 84. Petitioners are informed and believe that the Real Parties in Interest are threatening to

25 proceed with implementation of the Project in the near future. Implementation of the Project will

26 irreparably harm the environment in that the Real Parties will commence with environmentally

27 damaging activities without Respondents having prepared an EIR for the Project resulting in wildlife

28 and air quality impacts to Petitioners. A temporary restraining order and preliminary and permanent

20

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

injunctions should issue restraining Respondents and Real Parties from proceeding with the Project

2 without first preparing and certifying an EIR analyzing impacts and imposing all feasible mitigation

measures.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
(Violations of CEQA; Failure to Prepare EIR Despite Fair Argument of Potential Significant Impacts and IS/MND Not Supported by Substantial Evidence)
6
85. All of the above paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference as if set forth again in
7
full.
8
86. Respondents failed to comply with CEQA by failing to prepare an EIR for the Project

10 despite substantial evidence in the record of a fair argument that the Project may have one or more
significant environmental impacts, including but not limited to the following: 11

12 a. There is a fair argument that the Project may have significant impacts on

13 burrowing owls or their habitat because expert biologist Dr. Smallwood observed

14 habitat and numerous burrows preferred by owls present on the hillside adjacent to
the Project and no surveys capable of effectively detecting owls were performed at 15
the site. As a result, substantial evidence demonstrates that burrowing owls may be 16

17 present adjacent to the site and that construction and operation of the Project may
disturb or remove any such owls.
18
b. There is a fair argument that the Project may have significant impacts on 19

20 California tiger salamander or California red-legged frog or their habitat because

21 expert biologist Dr. Smallwood observed habitat and numerous burrows preferred

22 by those species as upland refugia and no surveys capable of effectively detecting

23 those species were performed at the site. As result, substantial evidence
demonstrates that California tiger salamander and California red-legged frog may 24

25 be present adjacent to the site and that construction and operation of the Project

may
26 disturb or remove individuals of those species or their habitat.

C.
27 There is a fair argument that the Project may have significant impacts on special

28 status bat species including the Western red bat and the pallid bat because the
IS/MND acknowledges these species may be present, no surveys capable of
21

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

2 detecting bats were performed, and preconstruction surveys are not adequate to

td ensure that adverse impacts will not result to these species from the demolition of
structures and removal of trees at the site.

d. There is a fair argument that the Project may have significant impacts on white-

6 tailed kites and loggerhead shrikes because the IS/MND acknowledges these

7 species may be present, no surveys capable of detecting kites and shrikes were

8 performed, and preconstruction surveys are not adequate to ensure that adverse
impacts will not result to these species from the construction and operation of the
Project.

10 e.

11 a There is a fair argument that the Project may have significant impacts on Cooper's

12 hawk, red-tailed hawk, and Common yellowthroat, each of which was observed by

13 Dr. Smallwood foraging and flying at or adjacent to the Project site because no

14 analysis of the Project's impacts was considered by respondents and Dr.

15 Smallwood provided evidence of potential impacts to these species.

f.

16 There is a fair argument that the Project may have significant direct or cumulative

17 impacts on wildlife from collisions with traffic generated from the Project. Despite

18 Dr. Smallwood provided supporting studies and observations that impacts are

19 likely, no analysis of this impact is provided in the IS/MND.

g.

20 The IS/MND's GHG emissions discussion fails to provide any substantive

21 discussion of the Project's GHG emission impacts or what, if any, mitigations

22 would be applied to the Project. This aspect of the IS/MND is entirely without is

23 evidentiary support and a fair argument exists that the Project may have significant
GHG emission impacts..

24 87.

25 Because a fair argument exists that the Project may have one or more significant

26 environmental impacts, the City must prepare an EIR for the Project to analyze all environmental

27 impacts and to propose all feasible mitigation measures and alternatives to reduce those impacts.
88.

28 Alternatively, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by adopting an
IS/MND the wildlife impact analysis for which is not supported by substantial evidence. The

22

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

IS/MND does not adequately describe the environmental setting of the Project by failing to perform
surveys capable of reliably detecting burrowing owls, California tiger salamanders, red-legged frogs,
pallid bats, western red bats, white-tailed kites, and loggerhead shrikes. By failing to properly survey

4 for these species, the City failed to properly investigate the possible impacts of the Project. Because

5 there is no reliable information that these species are not present at or adjacent to the site despite the

6 presence of habitat that is attractive to these species, the IS/MND and accompanying record fail to

7 provide factual documentation that the project will not have a significant effect on these species.

8 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
(Injunctive and Declaratory Relief Against Respondents and Real Parties in Interest)

10 89. All of the above paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference as if set forth again in

11 full.

12 90. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law. Unless enjoined,

13 Respondents and Real Parties in Interest will implement the Project despite their lack of compliance

14 with CEQA. Petitioners will suffer irreparable harm due to Respondents' failure to take the required

15 steps to protect the environment. Declaratory relief is appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure §

16 1060, injunctive relief is appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure § 525 et seq. and a writ of a

17 mandate is appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure § 1085 et seq. and 1094.5 et seq. and under

18 Public Resources Code § 21168.9, to prevent irreparable harm to the environment.

19 PRAYER

20 WHEREFORE, Petitioners and Plaintiffs pray that the Court:

21 1. Issue a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents to set aside the approvals of

22 the IS/MND and the Project unless and until Respondents have prepared, circulated, and considered

23 legally adequate CEQA document prior to any subsequent approval action;

24 2. Issue a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents and Real Parties in Interest

25 to suspend all activity in furtherance of the Project unless and until Respondents take all necessary

26 steps to bring their actions into compliance with CEQA;

27 3. Issue preliminary and permanent injunction staying the effect of Respondents'

28 approvals of the IS/MND and Project;

23

5. Award costs of suit;

4 6.

5 Award attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §1021.5 and any other

6 applicable provisions of law; and

7.
7 Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

VERIFICATION

I, Michael R. Lozeau, am an attorney for Petitioners in this action. I am verifying this Petition

4 pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 446. Petitioners are absent from the County

5 of Alameda, in which I have my office. I have read the foregoing petition and complaint. I am

RE: Notice of Intent to File Suit Under the California Environmental Quality Act
Regarding Dove Hill Medical Care Project (Project Files Nos. PDC14-051 and
PD16-019)

Dear Mayor Liccardo, Chair Allen, Director Hughey, Ms. Taber, and Mr. Doyle:
I am writing on behalf of Laborers International Union of North America, Local Union 270 ("LIUNA"), José Mexicano, and Alejandro Martinez ("Petitioners") regarding the City's approval of the Dove Hill Medical Care Project (*Project") and accompanying mitigated negative declaration.

Notice of Intent to File CEQA Suit re:
Dove Hill Medical Care Project
November 8, 2018
Page 2 of 3

Please take notice, pursuant to Public Resources Code ("PRC'') §21167.5, that Petitioners intend to file a Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief ("Petition"), under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), PRC $21000 et seq., against Respondents and Defendants City of San José, City Council of the City of San José, and the Planning Commission of the City of San José (*Respondents") in the Superior Court for the County of Santa Clara, challenging the October 23, 2018 decision of Respondent City Council of the City of San José to approve the Project and the accompanying mitigated negative declaration and mitigation and monitoring program. In doing so, the City Council affirmed the July 25, 2018 decision of Respondent Planning Commission of the City of San José also approving the Project and MND. The action will challenge each of these decisions.

The Petition being filed will request that the Court grant the following relief:

1. Issue a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents and Real Parties in
Interest to set aside the approval of the Dove Hill Medical Care Project unless and
until Respondents have prepared, circulated, and considered a legally adequate
CEQA document prior to any subsequent approval action;

2. Issue a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents and Real Parties in Interest to suspend all activity in furtherance of the Dove Hill Medical Care Project unless and until Respondents take all necessary steps to bring their actions into compliance with CEQA;

3. Issue a preliminary and permanent injunction staying the effect of Respondents' approval of the Dove Hill Medical Care Project;

4. Issue a declaratory judgment declaring Respondents' approval of the Dove Hill
Medical Care Project to be null and void and contrary to law;

5. Award costs of suit;

6. Award attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure $1021.5 and any other applicable provisions of law; and

7. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Sincerely,

Michuel' R Aezracr
