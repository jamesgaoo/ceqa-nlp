First Amended Petition for Writ of Mandamus

1 Petitioners allege:

2 Introduction

3

4 1. Save Historic San Anselmo, an unincorporated association, and resident

5 Laurel Mellin bring this mandamus action in the public interest to enforce mandatory
environmental and land use laws in the public interest. Petitioners challenge the Town's
7

8 approval of the 260 Crescent Road project without complying with mandates of its

9 Municipal Code, General Plan, and the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).

10 The project proposes demolition of an intact 1909 residence and accessory

11 dwelling that a 1986 Town Inventory identified as eligible for historic status.

26 As acknowledged by Town staff, "the existing residence is charming and contributes to
27

28 the neighborhood's historic character it has not been significantly modified."

First Amended Petition for Writ of Mandamus 1

1 The new owners, real parties in interest Charles and Ellen Jenkins, purchased

2 the property in 2016 for a reported $1.4 million. The Jenkins propose to demolish the
3
existing home to accommodate a much larger new home in the evocative Seminary 4

5 neighborhood - even though expanding the existing over-100-year-old home would be

6 feasible. The Council's 3-1 vote to approve the demolition was without benefit of an

7 independent evaluation of historic status, as recommended by its Planning Director.
8

9 The Town Council approved demolition based on unsupported findings in

10 violation of the Town Municipal Code and inconsistent with mandates of its General

11 Plan. The Town Council also exempted the project from CEQA despite inadequate
12 analysis of historic status and conceded environmental impacts. The Council also
13

14 recognized need for, and imposed, mitigation measures that now defeat the exemption.

15 A peremptory writ should issue requiring that the San Anselmo Town Council set

16 aside the project and conduct CEQA review before considering approvals that are
17

18 compliant with its Municipal Code and consistent with its General Plan.

19 Jurisdiction

20 2. This Court has jurisdiction under Public Resources Code section 21168 and
21
CCP section
22 1094.5. The parties and the project site reside in the County of Marin.

23 Parties

24 3. Petitioner Save Historic San Anselmo is an unincorporated association
25

26 formed in the public interest in August 2018 after the Town's approval of the 260

27 Crescent Road project. The association's purpose is to protect the historic neighborhood

28 and ensure the Town's compliance with CEQA and its own regulations and plans that

First Amended Petition for Writ of Mandamus 2

1 value the ongoing preservation of the Town's unique historic character. Petitioner

2 Laurel Mellin is a member of Save Historic San Anselmo and is a resident of the

3 neighborhood. All members of Save Historic San Anselmo are community residents
4

5 and concerned citizens who enjoy and appreciate the environmental and historical

6 resources of San Anselmo. They bring this petition on behalf of all others similarly

7 situated that are too numerous to be named and brought before this Court as
8

9 petitioners. Laurel Mellin objected to the Town's approval of the 260 Crescent Road

10 project and exhausted administrative remedies and acquired standing on behalf of

11 herself and the later-formed group.

12
4. Respondents Town of San Anselmo and its Town Council (collectively, the
13

14 Town) are the governmental body and lead agency that approved the project and a

15 categorical exemption from CEQA.

16 5. Real Parties in Interest Charles and Ellen Jenkins are the applicants for the
17

18 260 Crescent Road project and are so named in the CEQA Notice of Exemption.

19 6. Does 1 to 10 are fictitiously-named real parties in interest whose true

20 names and capacities are currently unknown to Petitioners. If and when their true

21 names and capacities are known, petitioners will amend this petition to assert them.
22

23 7. The paragraphs below refer to and rely on information in documents

24 relating to this action, all of which will be filed with this Court as part of the record of

25 I proceedings and are here incorporated by reference.

General Allegations

2
8. The 260 Crescent Road project proposes the demolition of a 1909 home
3

4 and accessory dwelling in the historic Seminary neighborhood of the Town in order to

5 build a new home, accessory dwelling unit, and garage, of substantially larger

6 dimension. The proposed project requires multiple discretionary Town permits:
7

8 Conditional use permit and design review to demolish existing structures.

9 Design review for the new residence and accessory dwelling unit (ADU).

10 Conditional use permit and variances for reduced setbacks for the ADU.

11 Variances to maintain a parking space in the front yard setback.

12 A minor exception for a bump out on the second story.
13

14 9. The Town prepared a Historic Resource Inventory in 1986 "to serve as the

15 a base document in a community-wide program that will be conducted to determine the
16

17 theme that will control future alterations and development in the downtown area; to

18 serve as a basic a document for the historic preservation concepts to be included in the

19 City's zoning and planning deliberations; and to provide basic information for a series
20 of envisioned applications nominating selected properties for the State or National 21

22 Register." During the inventory process, the Town completed a Historic Resources Data

23 Encoding Sheet for 260 Crescent Road for the California Department of Parks and

24 Recreation, and found the 1909 home now proposed for demolition to be eligible for
25

26 historic listing individually and as part of an historic district.

27 10. The Town Planning Commission first considered the 260 Crescent Road

28 project at a public hearing in February 2018. The Jenkins' architect, Ken Linsteadt,

First Amended Petition for Writ of Mandamus 4

explained his clients' proposal to demolish the 1909 residence and design a much larger|
new home and ADU incorporating the "historic characteristics" of San Anselmo.

3

4 Mr. Linsteadt stressed that landscaping would be developed that would become "super
important" to screen the mass and scale of the project to reduce acknowledged impacts

6 on neighborhood privacy.

7 11. Many Town residents, including architectural experts Jeff Kroot [the

9 former Town mayor, who served nine years on the Town Planning Commission and

10 sixteen years on the Town Council] and Luke Wade, opposed the demolition of the

11 existing home as well as the environmental impacts of the proposed new structures as

12 designed. They pointed out, inter alia, limited to 3-minutes each, that the project's
13

14 design problems could not be resolved by landscaping; that the overly-large new home

15 of vertical design that is out of scale with the unique horizontal homes in the Crescent

16 neighborhood would be destructive; that the project conflicts with mandates of the
17

18 Town General Plan; that the existing 1909 home can and should be significantly

19 enlarged rather than demolished; that the out-of-scale commercial size proposed for

20 the home would be comparable in size and mass to the Town library and playhouse;

21 and that the proposed design compromising light, air, and privacy would be
22

23 incompatible with the greater historic neighborhood and could not meet the approval

24 findings required by the Town Municipal Code, including Design Review Ordinance

25 Findings 2 and 3. The Planning Commission continued the hearing for modifications.
26
12.
27 Before the continued hearing in March, the Jenkins made slight design

28 revisions discussed by staff and the Commission at the February hearing, including an

First Amended Petition for Writ of Mandamus 5

1 18-inch reduction in the roof peak, removal of a proposed loft from the ADU so that it

2 would be single-story, and addition of a storage room expand the garage. Residents'

3 3-minute timed speeches continued to decry significant problems with the project's
4

5 proposed demolition and current design, including, inter alia, incompatibility of

6 demolition and new design in one of the Town's oldest neighborhoods with homes more

7 than 100 years old; inconsistency with quoted sections of the General Plan including
8

9 Land Use Element Objective 11; failure to make supportable Municipal Code findings to

10 preserve neighborhood character, avoid environmental impacts and loss of privacy to

11 adjacent properties, and ensure the compatibility of designs with existing development
12 mass and scale; failure to add onto the historic house rather than destroy it, to the
13

14 detriment of the neighbors and the larger community; and the setting of harmful

15 precedent encouraging further tear-downs of historic character-defining homes for

16 huge new dwellings. The Planning Commission nonetheless approved the project.
17
13.
18 Concerned Town residents filed an administrative appeal with the Town

19 Council, reiterating the concerns expressed at the Planning Commission and objecting
20 to reliance on a categorical exemption from CEQA.

21
14. The Planning Commission held an additional public hearing in April to
22

23 consider a grading permit for the 260 Crescent Road project. Town Planning Director

24 Elise Semonian explained that after the Jenkins submitted "grading information"

25 following the project approval in March, it became apparent that a permit was needed
26 for over 100 cubic yards of grading. Many residents objected to the piecemealing of the 27

28 project review and again reiterated objections to the approval. Among those speaking

First Amended Petition for Writ of Mandamus 6

1 was architect Jeff Kroot, who objected to violation of Town Municipal Code section

2 10-3.1305(e): "The Town will encourage the preservation, maintenance, restoration,

3

4 rehabilitation, moving or continued use of all structures of historic, cultural, or

5 aesthetic value." Mr. Kroot urged the Commission require a redesign. Resident Robert

6 Twiss discussed the need for CEQA review due to lack of evidence that the 1909 home is

7 not historic. Architectural historian Bradley Wedemeyer reiterated the qualifications
8

9 and importance of the home's architect, Harris Osborn, and the likely status of Crescent

10 Road as an historic district. Mr. Wedemeyer found the vertical scale of the proposed

11 house to be incompatible with the district; while there are Victorian houses that are

12 vertical in San Anselmo there are none in the immediate neighborhood and the vertical
13

14 contradicts the horizontal. The Commission nonetheless approved the permit.

25

26 15. A single de novo public hearing on the appeal of the Planning

27 Commission's March project approval was held before the Town Council on June 26.
28

First Amended Petition for Writ of Mandamus 7

1 As explained by Director Semonian, the appeal hearing would be "a 'de novo' hearing

2 and they can consider any new information and anything that the Planning Commission
3
considered." Commission videotapes were available for review by Councilmembers.
4

5 16. At the outset of the Council hearing, Director Semonian explained that

6 after the Planning Commission's approval, staff had become aware of the 1986

7 inventory of Town properties eligible for local historic listing. The subject property at
8

9 260 Crescent Road is in the inventory. Because the inventory has not been formally

10 adopted by the resolution of the Town Council, it is not a mandatory public resource

11 under CEQA; however, it qualifies as historic under local General Plan Policy 6.1.
12
17. Before the appeal hearing, Town staff required the Jenkins to provide an
13

14 historic resources evaluation. San Francisco architectural firm Page & Turnbull

15 prepared the report and it was made available to the public and Town Council the day

16 before the public hearing. Planning Director Semonian pointed out the report's multiple
17

18 errors and omitted information, reiterated by public speakers at the Council hearing,

19 and recommended that the Town Council therefore authorize a peer report. She noted
20 that the Page & Turnbull report had only considered individual historic qualifications of

21 the 260 Crescent Road home and failed to analyze its importance in the context of what
22

23 the inventory recognized as a local historic district. a

24 18. At the hearing before the Town Council on June 26, Councilmembers

25 expressed differing views of the historic resource protection requirements of CEQA and
26 the Town's own ordinances and policies. Vice-mayor Matt Brown cited mandates of the 27

28 General Plan protecting historic resources even more broadly than CEQA's definitions.

First Amended Petition for Writ of Mandamus 8

1 For example, the Town protects "architecturally important" structures and those with

2 "local historic values." Annie Wade and Jeff Kroot raised specific General Plan and

3 Municipal Code protections that would be violated by the demolition project, reiterated
4

5 by Vice-Mayor Brown when he later voted against the project based on inconsistencies

6 with the Town's codified Land Use Goals (C)(1), (3), and (5), Land Use Objective 11.1,

7 and Historic Preservation Policies 6.1 and 6.2.

8

19.
9 Other speakers at the Town Council hearing opposed the project on many

10 grounds, presenting a petition objecting to violation of Municipal Code section 10-

11 3.1305(e). They expanded on issues raised before the Planning Commission but added

12 others, focusing on the importance of the spectacular Crescent Road neighborhood and
13

14 the needless loss of the unique albeit modest home at 260 Crescent via demolition

15 when it could instead be rehabilitated and enlarged. Residents and some of the

16 Councilmembers expressed concerns about setting harmful precedent for tear-downs of
17 historic homes that define the Town's unique character. Two Councilmembers,
18

19 however, gave opinions that neighborhoods are important for "people, not buildings."

20 20. With few modifications to its design, the Council majority approved the

21 project and CEQA categorical exemption by a vote of 3-1. Vice-Mayor Brown's
22

23 dissenting vote, based on specific violations of the Town's codified planning mandates

24 for protection of historic values, was preceded by his ironic observation that people are

25 attracted to a neighborhood and then set about annihilating the elements that make it
26 special. He praised the Planning Commissioners' efforts based on the then-available
27

28 data, but noted the missing information on the historic nature of 26o Crescent Road.

First Amended Petition for Writ of Mandamus 9

1 Architecture is important, he said, and the demolition decision would have precedential

2 impact on the future of the Town's remaining historic resources.

21. The Town filed a Notice of Exemption (NOE) with the Marin County Clerk 4

5 on July 6, 2018. This action was timely filed on August 10, within 35 days of the filing.

22. Petitioners served a copy of this petition on the Attorney General.

23. Petitioners have no adequate remedy at law. Absent the relief prayed for,
8

9 the project will proceed with significant irreparable and irreversible environmental

10 impacts to the Town's environment and its residents. The Town Council has the ability

11 to correct its violations of law but has failed and refused to do so.

12
First Cause of Action
13 Violations of the California Environmental Quality Act
14

15 24. Petitioners incorporate all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.

16 25. The Town abused its discretion and failed to act in the manner required by
17

18 law in approving the 260 Crescent Road project based on a categorical exemption from

19 CEQA. According to proof following certification of the record of proceedings:

20 a. Categorical exemption from CEQA is disallowed because the Town adopted
21 mitigation measures to address conceded environmental impacts, including
22

23 "super important" landscaping to mitigate significant visual and privacy impacts.

24 The Town approved excavation of the site "to mitigate concerns of downhill

25 neighbors' perception of the height of the structure as well as privacy." The Town
26
also approved significant grading "to allow the property to have a lower visual 27

28 profile" and to "reduce visual impacts for adjacent neighbors." Condition 3

First Amended Petition for Writ of Mandamus 10

1 requires "screening landscaping ... along the full length of the south side property

2 line from the rear of the proposed garage to the rear property line. The
3 landscaping plan shall be designed to screen views of the residence from the
4

5 Woodland Avenue neighbors and preserve privacy between the sites. The

6 landscaping shall be installed prior to occupancy or project final and shall be

7 maintained." These are mitigations that require environmental review.
8

9 b. The Town failed to make a supported finding as to substantial evidence in the

10 record that the existing residence at 260 Crescent Road may not qualify for

11 listing in the California Register of Historic Places or justify local register listing,

12 despite its presence on the 1986 inventory, and relied on the incomplete and
13

14 inaccurate historic resources report prepared by Page & Turnbull. Our Supreme

15 Court has found that an unsupported study is not entitled to deference. There is

16 fair argument in the record that 260 Crescent is historic and qualifies for
17
exception from categorical exemption.
18

19 c. In light of unusual circumstances and evidence of significant environmental

20 impacts, environmental review is required to inform the Town's discretionary

21 decision to demolish 260 Crescent Road. The record contains substantial
22

23 evidence supporting a fair argument that demolition will have significant

24 environmental impacts, including, inter alia, impacts relating to historic

25 resources, aesthetics, and views, inconsistencies with the Town Municipal Code

26 and adopted land use plans and policies, among other impacts supported by
27

28

First Amended Petition for Writ of Mandamus 11

•substantial evidence in the e record, and CEQA thus requires preparation of an

initial study and an adequate environmental document.

3
Second Cause of Action
4 Violations of the Town Municipal Code and General Plan

6 26. Petitioners incorporate all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.

27. The Town failed to proceed in the manner required by law and its findings

8 in support of the project's permits and design review are not supported by substantial

10 evidence in the record, in violation of the Town Municipal Code and General Plan,

11 | according to proof. The findings are conclusory and fail to support a finding of

12 consistency with the General Plan and compliance with the Municipal Code sections as
13

14 referenced in the record and noted above, including but not limited to the June 20 staff

15 report and testimony at the Planning Commission and Town Council relating to

16 protection of historic values, neighborhood compatibility, mass and scale, and privacy.

17 28. Violations and inconsistencies include, inter alia according to proof:
18

19 Municipal Code section 10-3.1505 [Design Review Findings]; Land Use Element

20 Objective 11 ['To preserve, maintain, and enhance the existing character, scale, and

21 quality of life in San Anselmo's residential neighborhoods"]; Land Use Element,
22 Objective 6 ["To identify, protect, preserve, and restore buildings, features, and sites of
23

24 local historic value in San Anselmo"], Policy 6.2 ["The Town will endeavor to protect

25 from demolition or destruction or major alteration any building, feature, or site of local

26 historic value"] and Policy 11.1 ["New development, including rehabilitation and
27

28 expansion projects, shall be of a scale, intensity, and design that integrates with the

First Amended Petition for Writ of Mandamus 12

1 existing character of the surrounding neighborhood"]; Conservation Element Goal A.6

2 ["Preserve historic or architecturally important buildings"] and Policy B5 ["Unique

3 geological, ecological, and historic sites shall be protected"]; and Municipal Code
4

5 section 10-3.1305(e) ["The Town will encourage the preservation, maintenance,

6 restoration, rehabilitation, moving or continued use of all structures of historic,

7 cultural, or aesthetic value"].
8

9 WHEREFORE, Petitioners request:

10 1. That the Court issue a peremptory writ of mandate ordering the Town to

11 set aside and void all approvals relating to the 260 Crescent Road project and to refrain

12 from further consideration of project approval until it fully complies with CEQA by
13

14 preparing an adequate environmental document and adopting feasible alternatives and

15 mitigation measures for a project that fully complies with the Municipal Code and

16 General Plan;
17
2.
18 That the Court enjoin the Town and real parties in interest and their

19 employees and agents from project construction activities while the petition is pending;

20 3. For petitioners' costs and attorney fees pursuant to Code of Civil
21 Procedure section 1021.5; and
22

23 4. For other and further relief as the Court finds proper.
