PETITION FÖR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

Petitioner and Plaintiff CITY OF LAGUNA BEACH ("Petitioner," "Laguna Beach, or

2 the "City") alleges as follows:

3 INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY

1. Laguna Beach petitions this Court for a Writ of Mandate ("Petition"), directed
to Respondents COUNTY OF ORANGE (the "County"), the ORANGE COUNTY BOARD

6 OF SUPERVISORS (the "Board"), and all persons interested in the matter of the June 5, 2018,

7 approval of Resolution 18-052 (collectively "Respondents"). Specifically, Petitioner

8 challenges Respondents' unlawful actions taken on or about June 5, 2018, including

9 Respondents' certification of Environmental Impact Report 621 ("EIR") (SCH No.
10 2014121065) and approval of the intensive 803-unit residential development project known as
11 the "West Alton Development Plan" (hereinafter, "the Project").

12 2. The Project involves the redevelopment of two areas comprising a 32.32Hacre
13 portion of former Marine Corps Air Station ("MCAS") El Toro into an intensive high-density

14 residential development. The Project's Planning Area 1 and Planning Area 2 are bisected by a
15 300-foot wide, 11.84-acre, Wildlife Movement Corridor. Together, the two planning areas and
16 the Wildlife Movement Corridor are referred to as the West Alton Parcel ("WAP").
17 3. In certifying the EIR and approving the Project, Respondents prejudicially
18 abused their discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law, in violation of the
19 California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21000 et seq.) ("CEQA") and
20 the CEQA Guidelines, Title 14, California Code of Regulations, §§ 15000 et seq. ("CEQA
21 Guidelines") and with the State Planning and Zoning Law (Gov. Code, §§ 65000, et seq.).
22 4. Most egregiously, Respondents approved an intensive public/private residential
23 development Project that is fundamentally inconsistent with mandatory County General Plan
24 restrictions imposed through Measure W, a voter-approved initiative measure that amended the
25 County's General Plan to (a) specifically restrict the allowable uses of property within the
26 former MCAS El Toro, including the WAP, to education, park, recreation, cultural and other
27 public oriented uses and (b) require voter approval for any amendments to the initiative
28 measure consistent with Elections Code requirements.

2.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 5. Respondents' approval also violates express provisions of the 2003 Property

2 Tax Transfer and Pre-Annexation Agreement between the County, its former redevelopment

3 agency, and the City of Irvine (the "Pre-Annexation Agreement"). The Pre-Annexation

4 Agreement allowed annexation of the majority of the 4,700-acre area to the City of Irvine
("Irvine") but expressly limits development within the former MCAS El Toro area, and within

6 the WAP, to that which is consistent with Measure W.

6. As stated more specifically and comprehensively in the allegations concerning
the First Cause of Action, below, Respondents abused their discretion and failed to proceed in
the manner required by law, by inter alia refusing to:

10 analyze the Project's inconsistency with Measure W's provisions and the terms
11 of the Pre-Annexation Agreement, sweeping a difficult problem under the rug,

12 in violation of CEQA;

13 support the analysis and conclusions concerning the Project's numerous

14 potentially significant extra-jurisdictional environmental impacts - including,

15 but not limited to, the Project's direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts on

16 Laguna Beach's transportation and recreational facilities and to its police, fire,

17 and emergency services - with substantial evidence;

18 support the analysis and conclusions regarding the Project's potentially

19 significant impacts to the Wildlife Movement Corridor and biological resources

20 with substantial evidence;

21 analyze the Project's considerable contributions to the significant cumulative

22 impacts of intensive development within and adjacent to the Orange County
23 Great Park ("Great Park") (a.k.a., Irvine's Planning Area 51) - instead, the EIR

24 disregards and downplays these contributions in the overall scheme of intensive

25 development; and

26 consider feasible alternatives to the Project that could avoid and reduce its
27 significant environmental impacts.

28

3.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

The end result is that the EIR substantially understates the extent and severity of the Project's

2 environmental impacts and does not propose measures to avoid or mitigate those impacts.

3 7. Respondents also prejudicially abused their discretion by not consulting with

4 Laguna Beach concerning the Project's potential to significantly impact transportation

5 facilities within Laguna Beach, as well as its other extra-jurisdictional impacts, despite Laguna

6 Beach's repeated requests for consultation. By not complying with Petitioner's repeated

7 requests for notice and by refusing to consult with Laguna Beach as required, the County
undermined the City's ability to meaningfully participate in the environmental review process

9 and to influence the analysis of impacts and the consideration of mitigation measures and

10 alternatives.

11 8. Because the EIR does not comply with CEQA and the Project as approved
12 violates State Planning and Zoning Law, the County's certification of the EIR and its Project
13 approvals must be set aside.

14 PARTIES

15 9. Petitioner CITY OF LAGUNA BEACH is, and at all times herein mentioned
16 was, a general law city and municipal corporation incorporated within and existing pursuant to
17 the laws of the State of California. The City Council of the City of Laguna Beach is

18 responsible for regulating land use within its borders, and is charged with protecting the public
19 health and safety and promoting the general welfare and quality of life of its citizens. The City,
20 through its staff, legal counsel, and retained experts, has diligently participated in the
21 environmental review process for the Project. The City has the authority and duty to protect
22 the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens, residents, employees and visitors
23 within its boundaries and has exercised that authority and duty by seeking complete and
24 accurate impact analysis, consideration of feasible project alternatives, and full mitigation of
25 the significant environmental and land use impacts this large Project will cause.
26 10. Respondent COUNTY OF ORANGE is, and at all times herein mentioned was,
27 a political and geographic subdivision of the State of California. The County is, and at all
28 relevant times was, responsible for administering and carrying out its laws and all applicable

4.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

federal and State laws. The County is the "lead agency" for this Project under Public

2 Resources Code section 21067 because it has principal responsibility for conducting
Il environmental review and approving the Project. The County has a duty to comply with

4 CEQA, the State Planning and Zoning Law, applicable local planning documents (e.g., the

5 County General Plan) and with local ordinances.

6 11. Respondent ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS is, and at all

7 times herein mentioned was, the duly elected legislative body of Respondent County. As the

8 decision making body for the Project, the Board was charged with responsibilities under CEQA

9 for certifying the EIR for the Project and granting the various approvals necessary for the

10 Project, and with responsibilities under the State Planning and Zoning Law for ensuring the

11 Project is consistent with applicable land use plans. On or about June 5, 2018, the Board

12 certified the EIR and adopted Resolution 18-052.

13 12. Petitioner is unawe of the true names and capacities of Respondents DOES
14 through 10, and sue such respondents by fictitious names. Petitioner is informed and believes,

15 and on the basis of such information and belief, alleges that the fictitiously named respondents

16 are also responsible for the actions described in this Petition. When the true identities and

17 capacities of these respondents have been determined, Petitioner will amend this Petition, with

18 leave of court if necessary, to insert such identities and capacities.

19 13. Hereafter, Respondents the County, the Board, and DOES 1 through 10,
20 inclusive are referred to as "Respondents."

21 14. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Real Party in
22 Interest LOWE ENTERPRISES REAL ESTATE GROUP ("Lowe" or "Real Party in Interest")

23 is, and at all times herein mentioned was, a California corporation and a potential recipient of

24 Project approvals. Lowe and the County are parties to the Disposition and Development

25 Agreement ("DDA"), entered into on or about January 28, 2014, concerning the entitlement

26 and development of County-owned property at MCAS EI Toro, including the WAP. While the
27 WAP is described in the DDA, the DDA excludes the WAP from the Master Ground Lease

28 with Lowe. Thus, DDA does not address how the WAP will be controlled or disposed of

5.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

P following Project approval. The Notice of Preparation ("NOP") issued by the County does not
2 identify Lowe as the Project applicant or a recipient of Project approvals. Nevertheless,
3 because the County entered into the DDA with Lowe so that the latter entity could assist in

4 development of the Project site, Lowe is conservatively named herein as a real party in interest.
5 15. Petitioner is unaware of the true capacities of Real Parties in Interest DOES 11

6 through 20, and sue such real parties in interest by fictitious names. Petitioner is informed and

7 believes, and based on such information and belief, alleges that the fictitiously named real
8 parties in interest are directly and materially affected by the actions described in this Petition.

9 When the true identities and capacities of these real parties in interest have been determined,
10 Petitioner will amend this Petition, with leave of court if necessary, to insert such identities and
11 capacities.

12 16. Hereafter, Real Parties in Interest LOWE ENTERPRISES REAL ESTATE and

13 DOES 11 through 20, inclusive are referred to as "Real Parties in Interest."

14 BACKGROUND FACTS

15 17. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
16 their entirety.

17 Conveyance of Former MCAS El Toro, Passage of Measure W, and Annexation

18 18. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on the basis of such information and
19 belief, alleges that in July 1993, the U.S. Department of Navy ("DON") decided to close former
20 MCAS EI Toro and convey the Property to a local agency.
21 19. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on the basis of such information and
22 belief, alleges that on or about November 8, 1994 the voters of Orange County adopted
23 Measure A, the "Orange County/El Toro Economic Stimulus Initiative," which called for the
24 development of an international airport on former MCAS El Toro.
25 20. In response to the controversial airport proposal, another initiative measure was
26 placed on the ballot to designate other uses. Measure W, passed by majority of County voters
27 in March 2002, repealed Measure A and promised to dedicate the entire 4,700-acre MCAS El
28 Toro to educational, recreational, open space, habitat and compatible uses. Specifically, it

6.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

added two new categories of "Open Space" - "Nature Preserve" and "Education/Park
2 Compatible" - applicable only to lands within MCAS El Toro and replaced "the aviation use

3 designation with non-aviation designations [within the County's General Plan] to ensure that

4 the property will become a multi-use center for education, park, recreation, cultural and other
5 public oriented uses."

6 21. Measure W also imposed height restrictions within the Great Park area and lot

7 coverage restrictions. (See County General Plan, Land Use Element, pp. III-29 - III-30.) In

8 addition, Measure W incorporated a policy of limiting the number of allowable average daily

9 trips ("ADT") generated by uses throughout the entire 4,700-acre Great Park area to only
10 "ninety-six thousand (96,000) vehicle trips per day on average." (See County General Plan,

11 Transportation Element, pp. IV-23 - IV-24) It also established the policy "To significantly

12 expand the urban regional park system through the conversion of MCAS EI Toro into Orange
13 County's Central Park." (See County General Plan, Resources Element, p. VI-107.) Measure

14 W added the following language to the County's General Plan, Appendix VII-8:

15 The entire [MCAS El Torol site is designated either Education/Park Compatible

16 (EPC) overlay, Open Space Reserve (OSR) overlay, or Nature Preserve (NP) overlay; to be developed as an urban regional park with a habitat preserve

17 component, surrounded by a compatible setting of institutional, open space, open space compatible, and recreational uses. The urban regional park may contain

18 cultural and recreational uses including: sports parks, commercial recreation, stables, golf courses, agriculture, wildlife corridors, museums, libraries,

19 amphitheaters, expositions and fairs, zoos, theaters, botanical gardens, cultural fairs and attractions, and entertainment facilities and concessions. Veterans'

20 memorials and cemeteries shall also be considered appropriate.

21 (The above language is no longer included in Appendix VII-8 of the County General Plan, it is

22 unclear whether and when it may have been deleted.)

23 22. Petitioner is informed and believes that, on or about April 16, 2002,
24 approximately one month after Measure W passed, the Orange County Board of Supervisors
25 formally voted to cease further airport planning for the former MCAS El Toro and to support
26 the annexation and land use planning of the property by the City of Irvine. The Board also
27 decided not to pursue receipt of title to the former MCAS El Toro property and to negotiate
28 with the U.S. Department of Navy ("DON") to terminate a master lease existing between the

7.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

County and the DON. The El Toro Master Lease between the County and DON was

2 terminated in July 2002.

3 23. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on the basis of such information and

4 belief, alleges that, on or about April 23, 2002, the DON issued a Record of Decision ("ROD")

5 for the former MCAS El Toro property wherein the DON announced that the transfer of the

6 property would be in accordance with the intent of Measure W and the will of the people.

7 Subsequently, the DON announced its intention to sell the property by public auction in

8 accordance with federal surplus property disposal procedures.

9 24. Ultimately, Irvine, Irvine's former Irvine Redevelopment Agency ("Irvine
10 RDA"), and the County entered into the Pre-Annexation Agreement on or about March 4,

11 2003.

12 25. Exhibit A to the Pre-Annexation Agreement describes as "public facilities" both
13 the WAP Parcel and the 100-acre El Toro site. Section 2.2.4 of the Pre-Annexation Agreement
14 provides:

15 Irvine agrees that while the parcels of Base property the County is to receive
16 will be annexed to Irvine, that notwithstanding said fact, Irvine will zone County's parcels and designate them in Irvine's General Plan, in accordance
17 with the County's designation. In addition, County shall retain exclusive land use control over said parcels, and shall be entitled to place any development
18 upon said parcels the County shall determine to be desirable for County's needs, as though said property remained unincorporated, without the obligation for
19 payment to Irvine for any permit fees or other mitigation/impact fees, other than in Section 2.2.5, including but not limited to the following uses, all of which

20 Irvine agrees with. The uses listed in Section 2.2.4 include animal shelters, environmental health facilities, automotive/equipment repair facilities, child care
21 facilities, youth and family resource center, law enforcement training facilities, emergency shelters, transitional shelter care facilities, children and family

22 service centers, business offices, warehouses, storage facilities, vehicle parking and storage facilities, heavy equipment maintenance and storage, and field

23 operation and maintenance facilities. (Emphasis added.)

24 26. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on the basis of such information and
25 belief, alleges that Irvine completed its annexation of the former MCAS El Toro properties,
26 specifically including the WAP Parcel, in January 2004.

27

28

8.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 Irvine's Great Park Plans and Development

2 27. Leading up to Irvine's annexation of almost all of the 4,700-acre area, in 2003
Irvine prepared a programmatic EIR to analyze its plans for developing a "Great Park" (the

4 "2003 PEIR"). The 2003 PEIR for the Great Park described and anticipated up to 2,600 acres

5 of parkland, open space, and other public uses and analyzed a cap on residential development

6 of 3,625 units. The 2003 PEIR for the Great Park identified significant and unavoidable

7 impacts in the areas of air quality, traffic, population and housing, and agricultural resources.

8 28. Through successive project modifications, which were accompanied by multiple

9 CEQA addenda and supplements to the 2003 PEIR, Irvine has since substantially increased the

10 cap on residential units within the OCGP area to 9,500 units, plus density bonus units (with

11 some corresponding reduction of allowable non-residential development) while reducing the

12 acreage of dedicated and funded parkland.

13 The Project and Environmental Review

14 29. The Project will be located within two planning areas that together comprise
15 32.32+/- acres separated by the Wildlife Movement Corridor. The WAP is located near the

16 northeast intersection of Alton Parkway and Irvine Boulevard, in the City of Irvine. The

17 irregularly shaped undeveloped site is generally bound by Irvine Boulevard on the southwest,

18 business and industrial buildings and Irvine Ranch Water District ("IRWD") facilities on the

19 south and southeast, and property owned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI") to the

20 north. The surrounding area is developed on three sides with residential, commercial,

21 government, and office uses and is undeveloped to the north and northeast. The Wildlife

22 Movement Corridor provides critically important habitat connectivity between inland open

23 space areas, including Whiting Ranch Wilderness Park and Limestone Canyon, and coastal

24 open space areas, including Laguna Coast Wilderness Park.

25 30. As ultimately approved, the Project would replace open space habitat and
26 undeveloped land with large multi-unit residential buildings with 802 units housing
27 approximately 1,600 residents. Based upon the County's trip generation rates, which are used

28

9
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 to calculate the amount of traffic a project can be expected to generate, the Project will generate

2 almost 5,000 vehicle trips per day.

3 31. On or about January 28, 2014, the Board approved a Disposition and
Development Agreement ("DDA") with Lowe, which set up the framework for the

5 development of both the WAP and the 100-acre El Toro site with private uses.

6 32. In December 2014, the County released the NOP for the Draft EIR to analyze

7 the environmental impacts of the Project and several alternatives.

8 33. In May 2015, Laguna Beach sent the County a letter pointing out that it had not
9 received notice of the Project, commenting on the NOP and the scope of environmental impact
10 analysis, and requesting notice of all projects within the County's jurisdiction that could

11 potentially impact transportation facilities within the City's jurisdiction.

12 34. In July 2015, soon after the County cancelled a scheduled scoping meeting at the
13 last minute, Laguna Beach sent the County another letter with additional comments concerning
14 the scope of environmental impact analysis for the Project. This letter urged the County to
15 consider in the forthcoming Draft EIR the potentially significant extra-jurisdictional traffic

16 impacts to Laguna Beach roadways and the Project's potential interference with and impacts to
17 the Wildlife Movement Corridor.

18 35. On or about October 20, 2015, Laguna Beach planning staff met with County
19 planning staff to discuss the scope of the traffic impact analysis for the Project and for the

20 County's simultaneously-proposed 100-acre El Toro project.
21 36. On or about February 7, 2017, prior to the close of the public comment period,
22 Laguna Beach submitted comments on the Draft EIR. Laguna Beach criticized the Project's
23 inconsistency with General Plan provisions enacted through Measure W and the Draft EIR's
24 deficient analysis of potentially significant extra-jurisdictional impacts.
25 37. Laguna Beach's Draft EIR comment letter included a letter from Petitioner's
26 / traffic consultant. This letter pointed out numerous flaws in the EIR's traffic impact analysis.
27 38. On or about May 24, 2018, more than a year and a half after the County released
28 the DEIR and just 10 calendar days until the final Board meeting where the Project would be

10.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

considered for approval, the County published a Notice of Availability ("NOA") and issued its
2 substantially revised FEIR, including the responses to public comments.
3 39. The County did not send notice of its completed FEIR and its scheduled Board

4 meeting to Petitioner in the manner Petitioner specifically requested in accordance with Public

5 Resources Code, section 21092.2. Rather than send email notice to Petitioner's legal counsel

6 and designated staff, the County mailed notice to the City Manager on the day before the long
7 Memorial Day weekend. As a consequence, Petitioner's review of the FEIR was delayed.

8 Project Approval

9 40. On or about June 5, 2018, the Board held a public hearing to consider the
10 whether to certify the EIR and approve the Project.

11 41. Prior to the public hearing, and despite the extremely short time frame in which

12 to review the FEIR, Petitioner submitted a letter to the Board and to County staff objecting to
13 certification of the FEIR and approval of the Project and reiterating serious concerns that the

14 County had not adequately addressed in its responses.

15 42. Petitioner's June 4, 2018, letter identified a number of legally inadequate topical
16 responses and specific responses to individual comments in the FEIR, including responses to
17 the Laguna Beach's comments concerning land use impacts related to the Project's
18 inconsistency with Measure W, extra-jurisdictional impacts to recreation/parkland, traffic and
19 transportation, and public services, and the narrow range of alternatives considered in the

20 analysis.

21 43. At its public meeting, the Board adopted Resolution 18-052 by 3-1 vote (with
22 one member abstaining), certifying the EIR, adopting Findings a of Fact and a Statement of

23 Overriding Considerations, and approving the West Alton Development Plan (collectively, the

24 "Project Approvals").

25 44. On or about June 5, 2018, the County filed a CEQA Notice of Determination

26 ("NOD") with the County clerk.

27

28

11.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2 45. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
3 their entirety.

4 46. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to
5 Code of Civil Procedure sections 526, 527, 1060, 1085, 1087, and 1094.5, Public Resources

6 Code section 21168 and/or 21168.5, and Government Code section 65860.

7 47. Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the State of

8 California in and for the County of Orange pursuant to section 394 of the Code of Civil

9 Procedure. The Respondents are located within the County of Orange and the Project will be
10 located within the County of Orange.

11 48. The subject matter of this Petition relates to Respondents' June 5, 2018,
12 approval of Resolution 18-052, which relates to real property within the boundaries of the City
13 of Irvine. Code of Civil Procedure section 860 et seq. authorizes a local agency or private party
14 to bring an action in the Superior Court of the County in which the principal office of the local
15 agency is located to determine the validity of a matter that under any other law authorizes to be
16 determined pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 860 et seq. Code of Civil Procedure

17 section 860 et seq. establishes that this case is, among other things, a proceeding in rem. Under
18 these facts, jurisdiction and venue are proper in the Superior Court of the State of California,

19 County of Orange.

20 49. The Court has jurisdiction over all interested parties by the publication of the
21 Summons in this matter in a newspaper of general circulation designated by the Court,

22 published in Orange County and within the boundaries of the County and the City, as specified
23 by Government Code section 6063, and by mailing copies of the Summons and Complaint to
24 those persons, if any, or their attorneys, no later than ten (10) days after completion of
25 publication of the Summons have either expressly notified Petitioner's attorneys in writing of
26 their interest in this matter, or have filed and served actions against Petitioner, the County of
27 Orange, or the Orange County Board of Supervisors, challenging the validity of the subject of
28 this action.

12.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 STANDING AND EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

2 50. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
3 their entirety.

4 51. Laguna Beach has standing to assert the claims alleged in this Petition because it
5 is beneficially interested in this matter. Although the Project is located a few miles east of

6 Laguna Beach's eastern border, within the City of Irvine, a significant portion of the Project's

7 traffic will travel the streets and highways within Laguna Beach. Other Project impacts as well

8 will be exported to Laguna Beach, contributing to significant cumulative impacts that adversely

9 affect Laguna Beach's roadways, recreational amenities, and public services. As a local

10 government body that represents individuals who live or work in the Project's vicinity who will

11 be directly affected by the significant environmental impacts of the Project, Laguna Beach has

12 a direct interest in ensuring that Respondents fulfill their duties under CEQA and the Planning

13 and Zoning Law.

14 52. Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 367, Petitioner has
15 standing to sue if it or someone it represents has either suffered or are threatened with an injury

16 of sufficient magnitude to reasonably assure the relevant facts and issues will be adequately
17 presented. Laguna Beach has a duty to protect the public, health, safety, and welfare of its

18 residents, businesses, and visitors. Here Petitioner has standing to sue because the residents,

19 businesses and visitors are threatened with injuries caused by the County's approval of this

20 Project.

21 53. Prior to Respondents' decision to approve the Project, Laguna Beach actively
22 participated in the administrative process, objected to the Project approval, and urged the Board

23 to order the EIR to be revised to address significant unmitigated impacts and recirculated for

24 public review.

25 54. Laguna Beach has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the

26 instant action and have exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent

27 possible and required by law.

28

3 their entirety,

4 56. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on the basis of such information and

5 belief, alleges that on June 5, 2018, Respondents filed a CEQA NOD for the Project.

6 57. Pursuant to Public Resources Code, section 21167, subdivision (b) and CEQA
7 Guidelines, sections 15094(g) and 15112(c)(1), the statute of limitations for CEQA challenge

11 59. Pursuant to Government Code, section 65009, subdivision (c), the statute of
12 limitations for a State Planning and Zoning Law challenge to the Respondents' decision to
13 approve a project based on inconsistency with its General Plan, zoning ordinances and zoning

14 designations, is 90 days after Respondents' decision became final.

15 60. This Petition was filed in Orange County Superior Court prior to the 90th day
16 following Respondents' final decision on the Project.
17 61. As required by Code of Civil Procedure section 860, this action has been filed

18 within 60 days after the Respondents' final Project approvals of the Project Approvals and

19 therefore is timely.
20 62. Laguna Beach has filed this Petition prior to the expiration of any and all
21 applicable statute of limitations.

22 NOTICE OF CEQA SUIT

23 63. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
24 their entirety.

25 64. On July 3, 2018, Petitioner sent by email and overnight mail a letter to Hugh
26 Nguyen, the County Clerk-Recorder and to County Counsel Leon Page giving notice to
27 Respondents of Petitioner's intent to file this lawsuit on or before July 5, 2018, seeking to
28 invalidate the City's various actions approving the EIR. for the Project and Project itself. (See

14.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 Exhibit A: letter to County Clerk-Recorder and to County Counsel.) This letter satisfied

2 Petitioner's duties under Public Resources Code section 21167.5.

3 65. Petitioner will provide notice of this action to the Attorney General of the State

4 of California, by serving a true and correct copy of this Petition along with a notice of its filing,

5 as required by Public Resources Code, § 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure, § 388.

6 PREPARATION OF THE RECORD

7 66. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in

8 their entirety.

9 67. Pursuant to Public Resources Code, § 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2), Petitioner

10 elects to prepare the record of proceedings in this action. Concurrently with this Petition,

11 Petitioner is filing a notice of its election to prepare the administrative record.

12 ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS ACTIONS

13 68. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in

14 their entirety.

15 69. Petitioner brings this action on the basis, among others, of Government Code

16 section 800, and other applicable laws, which award Petitioner's attorneys' fees in actions to

17 overturn agency decisions that are arbitrary and capricious, such as the decisions in question

18 here.

19 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE

20 70. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in

21 their entirety.

22 71. Petitioner brings this action as a private attorney general pursuant to Code of

23 Civil Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important

24 rights affecting the public interest.

25 72. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a significant benefit

26 on the general public by requiring the Respondents to carry out their duties under CEQA, the

27 Planning and Zoning Law, and other applicable laws before approving the Project.

28

15.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

73. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will also result in the

2 enforcement of important rights affecting the public interest by (a) compelling the Respondents
3 to engage in a fair, objective, and legally adequate analysis of the Project's environmental
4 impacts, and to ensure that the public has a meaningful opportunity to review and comment on

5 these impacts and mitigation measures for that Project and (b) requiring that development of

6 the WAP is consistent with the land use restrictions imposed through Measure W.
7 74. • The necessity and financial burden of enforcement are such as to make an award

8 of attorneys' fees appropriate in this case. Absent enforcement by Petitioner, Respondents and

9 Real Parties in Interest will proceed with a Project that will cause significant, unmitigated
10| environmental impacts that might otherwise have been reduced or avoided through legally

11 adequate environmental review and the adoption of feasible mitigation measures.

12 75. Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.7. Petitioner will serve a copy
13 of this Petition on the California Attorney General's office to give notice that Petitioner brought

14 this lawsuit as private attorneys general under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.

15 IRREPARABLE HARM

16 76. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
17 their entirety.

18 77. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary
19 law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside

20 their certification of the EIR for, and approval of, the Project. In the absence of such remedies,
21 Respondents' approvals will remain in effect in violation of State law and Petitioner, and its

22 residents, businesses, and visitors, will be irreparably harmed. No money damages or legal
23 remedy could adequately compensate Petitioner and its residents, businesses, and visitors for

24 that harm.

25 RELIEF REQUESTED

26 78. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
27 their entirety.

28

16.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

79. Petitioner seeks a writ of mandate, temporary and permanent injunctive relief,
2 costs, and attorneys' fees.

3 A. Alternative and Peremptory Writs f Mandamus

4 (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1085, 1087, 1094.5; Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21168, 21168.5,

5 21168.9, Gov. Code, §§ 65860, 65030.1)
80.
6 Petitioner seeks alternative and peremptory writs of mandate pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 1094.5. Alternatively, Petitioner seek alternative and peremptory 7 writs of mandate pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085. Petitioner also seeks a writ
8 of mandate pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1087, which provides that "[t]he writ
9 may be either alternative or peremptory."
10
81. Petitioner seeks alternative and peremptory writs of mandate pursuant to Public
11 Resources Code sections 21168 and/or 21168.5 and 21168.9.
12
82.
13 Petitioner also seeks alternative and peremptory writs of mandate on the grounds
that Respondents adopted a Development Plan that is inconsistent with the County's General 14 Plan policies in violation of the State Planning and Zoning Law.
15
83.
16 Petitioner seeks alternative and peremptory writs of mandate requiring the
County to void its certification of the EIR for the Project, its approval of the West Alton
17

18 Development Plan, and any and all other approvals issued for the Project. Petitioner seeks to
void such actions on the grounds that the County did not substantially comply with CEQA and
19 the State Planning and Zoning Law before taking those actions.
20
B. Temporary and Permanent Injunctive Relief
21
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 526, 527, 1094.5; Civ. Code, § 3422.)
22 76. Petitioner requests injunctive relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections
23 526 and 527, and Civil Code section 3422.
24 84. Petitioner also requests an administrative stay pursuant to Code of Civil
25 Procedure section 1094.5, subdivision (g), which provides that the court "may stay the
26 operation of the administrative order or decision pending the judgment of the court," if the
27 court concludes that such a stay is not "against the public interest."
28

17.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 85. Respondents' actions will result in irreparable harm to Laguna Beach, those who
2 reside, work or own property in this city and the public at large in southern Orange County in
that the Project as approved will cause significant environmental impacts that will not be
4 mitigated to less than significant levels.

5 86. Laguna Beach and those who reside, work or own property in this city and the
6 public at large have also been harmed by an EIR that does not accurately and fully inform
7 interested persons of the Project's true impacts. A revised and recirculated EIR would lead to
8 better environmental decision making regarding the Project, and would enable all residents of

9 the affected region to better understand the true environmental and economic values of the

10 elected decision makers of the County,

11 87. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of
12 law. No money damages or other legal remedy could adequately compensate Petitioner for the
13 in harms described in the preceding paragraphs.

14 C. Attorneys' Fees and Costs

15 (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1021.5, 1032; Gov. Code, §§ 800)
16 88. This litigation involves the enforcement of important rights affecting the public
17 interest. Accordingly, if Petitioner is successful in prosecuting this action, Petitioner will
18 confer a substantial benefit on the citizens of the region and state, and therefore will be entitled
19 to an award of reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.

20 89. Petitioner also bring this action pursuant to Government Code section 800,
21 which awards petitioners up to $7,500.00 in attorneys' fees in actions to overturn agency
22 decisions, such as those at issue herein, that are arbitrary and capricious.
23 90. Additionally, Petitioner requests reimbursement for costs pursuant to Code of
24 Civil Procedure section 1032, subdivision (b), which provides that "[e]xcept as otherwise
25 expressly provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs
26 in any action or proceeding."

27 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

28 Violations of CEQA (CCP § 1085, PRC § 21168.5)

18. PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

Failure to Proceed in the Manner Required by Law and Failure to Act on the Basis of

2 Substantial Evidence - By Petitioner Against Respondents
91. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates by reference into this First Cause of 3

4 Action all of the preceding and succeeding paragraphs of this Petition as though fully set forth
herein.

92. Respondents violated CEQA, and the Project Approvals, specifically including
6 Respondents' certification of the EIR, must be rescinded for the following non-exclusive
7
reasons:
8
a. The EIR does not fully analyze the Project's potentially significant
impacts related to land use by, inter alia, incorrectly assuming that the Project is exempt from 10 the County's General Plan (including Measure W). The EIR further fails to make a good-faith 11 effort at fully disclosing the Project's conflicts and inconsistencies with applicable land use
12 plans, policies and regulations and the resulting impacts, as required.
13
b. The EIR does not fully analyze the Project's potentially significant
14 impacts to biological resources, including inter alia the Project's potential to interfere with the
15 functions of the Wildlife Movement Corridor.
16
C.
17 The County did not consult with Laguna Beach concerning the Project's
extra-jurisdictional traffic impacts, as required for this Project of regional and areawide
18
significance.
19 d. The EIR's impact analysis utilized an improperly narrow geographic
20
scope for the Project's traffic study. As a result, the EIR. does not adequately disclose, analyze
21 or mitigate the Project's traffic impacts, particularly on intersections and road segments in and
22 near Laguna Beach.
23
e. The EIR did not accurately estimate the Project's contributions to
24 cumulative impacts, including cumulative impacts to traffic and transportation, recreation
25 facilities and amenities, and public services.
26 f. The EIR did not consider cumulative impacts of the Project when
27 combined with the impacts of all relevant past, present, and reasonably probable future
28 development projects, The EIR's cumulative impacts analysis does not consider readily
19. PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 available information from Irvine's 2003 PEIR and subsequent environmental review

2 documents concerning intensive residential, commercial, and other private development within

3 former MCAS EI Toro (the OCGP), and the significant impacts such development would

4 cause.

5 g. The County has not complied with its duty to identify, and adopt feasible

6 mitigation measures to substantially lessen or avoid, all of the Project's potentially significant

7 impacts. More specifically, the EIR did not propose feasible mitigation for the Project's

8 significant impacts on the environment, including inter alia, the Project's potentially significant

9 impacts to land use, biological resources, and extra-jurisdictional impacts on traffic, recreation,
10 public services.

11 h. The EIR does not study an adequate and/or reasonable range of

12 alternatives to the Project, as proposed and ultimately approved.
13 i. The FEIR's Responses to Comments are nonresponsive and/or otherwise
14 legally inadequate, specifically including, but not limited to, the Responses to Comments

15 regarding land use impacts, extra-jurisdictional impacts to recreation/parkland, traffic and
16 public services, and the EIR's alternative analysis, in violation of CEQA and CEQA Guidelines

17 section 15088 in particular.

18 j. The County added significant new information to the FEIR, such that

19 recirculation of the revised analysis for public review and comment was required, pursuant to
20 CEQA Guidelines section 15088.5.

21 93. The EIR therefore does not satisfy CEQA's requirements for an informational
22 document. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law by preparing an
23 environmental document that does not fulfill CEQA's informational purposes.
24 94. As a result of the forgoing deficiencies, the County's Findings of Fact with
25 regard to project-specific and cumulative impacts are not supported by substantial evidence.

26 Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law by adopting legally inadequate
27 findings before approving the Project.

28

20.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 95. The Statement of Overriding Considerations approved by Respondents in

2 connection with this Project are legally and factually deficient, and not supported by substantial

3 evidence in the administrative record.

4 96. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law by refusing to

5 disclose how this Project's impacts relate to the unmitigated significant impacts for which a

6 Statement of Overriding Considerations was adopted following Irvine's certification of the

7 2003 PEIR.

8 97. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law by not making all

9 referenced documents available during the brief period in which the EIR was available for

10 public review, in violation of Public Resources Code, section 21092, subdivision (b)(1).

11 98. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their
12 discretion by certifying an EIR that does not comply with the requirements of CEQA. As such,
13 Respondents' certification of the Final EIR and approval of the Project must be set aside.

14 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

15 Violations of the State Planning and Zoning Law

16 (Government Code, § 65000 et seq.) - By Petitioner Against Respondents

17 99. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates by reference into this Second Cause
18 of Action all of the preceding and succeeding paragraphs of this Petition as though fully set
19 forth herein.

20 100. Petitioner performed all the conditions precedent to filing this action by
21 submitting comments on the Draft EIR and additional comments prior to two public hearings,
22 in compliance with Government Code section 65009, subdivision (b). By submitting written
23 comments, Petitioner exhausted administrative remedies as required by State and local planning
24 law. To the extent that Planning and Zoning Law violations raised in litigation were not raised
25 prior to final Project approval, Petitioner is excused because the County did not provide
26 Petitioner with the requested notice.
27 101. Under State and local planning law, in order for Respondents to approve a plan
28 for development on a parcel within "unincorporated" County jurisdiction, Respondents must

21.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

find that the approvals are consistent with the County's General Plan ("General Plan"). To be

2 found consistent with the General Plan, the approved Development Plan must further the
objectives and policies of the General Plan and may not prevent their attainment.
4 102. All public agencies, including the County, have a mandatory duty to refuse to

5 approve any private development project that is inconsistent with the applicable General Plan.

6 Likewise, all public agencies have a mandatory duty to a refuse to approve any private
7 development project that is inconsistent with the relevant property's zoning designation.

8 103. The County has asserted that provisions of the Orange County Zoning Code
9 exempts land owned or leased by the County from all County land use regulations. However,
10 under the Planning and Zoning Law, County owned property within unincorporated areas must
11 be consistent with the County's General Plan (including Measure W).
12 104. Respondents violated the State Planning and Zoning Law, Government Code,
13 section 65000 et seq., by approving a Project that was inconsistent with the County's General
14 Plan. Among other things, Respondents approved a Project that is inconsistent with County
15 General Plan provisions adopted through Measure W, including inter alia:
16 a) County General Plan, Land Use Element, Table III-1 (description of Open
17 Space Reserve designation);

18 b) County General Plan, Transportation Element, Implementation Program 6(a);
19 c) County General Plan, Resources Element, Policy 4.2; and
20 d) Appendix VII-8 of the County General Plan (as modified by Measure W).
21 105. The County also violated the State Planning and Zoning Law by not providing
22 Laguna Beach with the requested notice of the public hearing on July 5, 2018. Such notice was
23 required pursuant to Government Code, sections 65092. Because Laguna Beach repeatedly
24 requested that notice of Project-related actions be sent to specified recipients (including
25 designated city staff and legal counsel), the County was required to provide such notice to those
26 persons at least 10 days in advance of the June 5, 2018.
27 106. The County's failure to provide the requested notice concerning the final
28 hearing concerning the Project harmed Laguna Beach because it denied the city the full ability

22.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 to comment on Project's inconsistency with County General Plan provisions and to express its

2 opposition to the Project.

3 107. Accordingly, because the Project is fundamentally inconsistent with County

4 General Plan adopted through Measure W, a writ must issue overturning Respondents'
approval of Resolution 18-052. The County has abused its discretion by approving the Project.

6 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

7 Declaratory Relief (CCP § 1060) - By Petitioner Against Respondents
8 108. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates by reference into this Third Cause
9 of Action all of the preceding and succeeding paragraphs of this Petition as though fully set

10 forth herein.

11 109. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that the violations of
12 CEQA and the Planning and Zoning Law described above are not isolated occurrences but

13 instead continue & pattern and practice. Respondents approved at least one other development
14 project despite its inconsistency with Measure W.

15 110. In November 2017, Respondents approved the El Toro Development Plan after
16 certifying a Programmatic EIR for this intensive mixed-use development project also located

17 within former MCAS EI Toro.

18 111. There is a present and actual controversy between Petitioner and Respondents as
19 to the legality of the County's practice of disregarding Measure W when considering

20 development proposals within the OCGP, in violation of CEQA and the Planning and Zoning

21 Law. This controversy is ongoing and continuing,

22 112. Petitioner desires a judicial determination of the rights and obligations of the
23 respective parties concerning the allegations in this Petition related to Respondents' illegal
24 pattern and practice. An action for declaratory relief under California Code of Civil Procedure

25 :Op 1060 "is an appropriate means of challenging an alleged overarching policy or practice of an

26 agency where there is an actual and present controversy over the policy [or practice]." (K.G. v.
27 Meredith (2012) 204 Cal.App.4th 164, 177.)

28

23. PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 113. Such a declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time in order that

2 Petitioner may ascertain the right to require Respondents to act in accordance with the
requirements of CEQA and the Planning and Zoning Law with respect to considering the

4 restrictions imposed through Measure W when analyzing and mitigating the land use impacts

5 caused by proposed development projects within former MCAS El Toro.

6 114. Petitioner alleges and declares, and seeks a declaration of this Court as a provided
7 below, that the Pre-Annexation Agreement, and specifically Sections 2.2.3 and 2.2.4 thereof,

8 requires that the WAP and all other County owned property within former MCAS El Toro, and

9 uses thereupon, are subject to, and remain subject to, the County's General Plan (including

10 Measure W), the County's Zoning Code, the California Subdivision Law, and all other

11 procedures applicable to all public/private developments in the County provided, however,

12 permitted uses, as defined and set forth in Section 2.2.4, shall be allowed on, and constitute

13 permitted uses of, the WAP Parcel.

14 115. Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA and the Planning and Zoning Law
15 with respect to development proposals for property subject to Measure W irreparably harms
16 and will continue to irreparably harm Petitioner and its members in that Respondents' actions

17 expose Petitioner and its members to increased unmitigated environmental impacts.

18 116. Petitioner has no adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law to obtain relief
19 from the consequences of Respondents' practice. Petitioner lacks an adequate remedy because
20 monetary damages cannot be ascertained and Petitioner cannot be compensated for the

21 unmitigated impacts and lack of public disclosure and accountability caused by the
22 Respondents' pattern. In addition, it is impracticable and a waste of judicial resources for
23 Petitioner to challenge each project that is subject to the restrictions of Measure W.

24 117. Petitioner is informed and believes, and alleges thereon, that Respondents
25 dispute each and every one of the allegations and declarations set forth in paragraphs 105

26 through 112, above, and that an actual controversy exists as to each and every allegation and
27 declaration therein.

28

24.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 Reverse Validation Action (CCP §§ 860, 863) - By Petitioner Against Respondents

3 118. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates by reference into this Fourth Cause

4 of Action all of the preceding and succeeding paragraphs of this Petition as though fully set

5 forth herein.

6 119. This action was properly brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section

7 860, et seq., as an action to determine the validity of Respondents' actions regarding Resolution

8 No. 18-052. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 860 and 863, Code of Civil

9 Procedure section 1060, and other provisions of law, Petitioner seeks to invalidate each of the

10 Project authorizations, actions, determinations, findings, and approvals for the reasons set forth

11 in this Petition.

12 120. Petitioner requests that each of the unlawful approvals relating to the Project
13 and/or on the WAP be invalidated; that this Court issue one or more peremptory writs of
14 mandamus ordering the Respondents, and/or each of them, to rescind, set aside and invalidate

15 all or part of the unlawful Project approvals as proven at trial or hearing on this matter; and
16 request that the Court issue a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, and a
17 permanent injunction, all enjoining Respondents and its agents, servants, and employees and
18 subdivisions from approving the Project and/or other uses of the WAP absent Respondents' full

19 compliance with legal requirements under State and local laws.

20 121. Petitioner requests that all persons, including but not limited to Respondents, are
21 hereby permanently enjoined and restrained from the institution of any action or proceeding
22 enforcing, or attempting to enforce, in any way, Resolution No. 18-052, and/or any matters
23 herein adjudicated or which at this time could have been adjudicated against all persons
24 interested in these matters.

25 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

26 Wherefore, Petitioner CITY OF LAGUNA BEACH respectfully requests the following
27 relief and entry of judgment as follows:

28

25.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 1. Alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to vacate

2 and set aside certification of the EIR and approval of the entitlements for the Project on the

3 grounds that adequate CEQA compliance did not precede those actions;

4 2. Appropriate temporary, preliminary, and/or permanent injunctive relief to
5  prevent Respondents and Real Parties in Interest from taking further actions to implement or

6 proceed with the Project during the pendency of this litigation and subsequent to the Court's

7 issuance of an alternative or peremptory writ;

8 3. An order requiring Respondents to rescind their approval of the Project and all

9 actions related thereto;

10 4. For a declaration that any development of County-owned property within former
11 MCAS El Toro, including the WAP, must comply with the County's General Plan (including

12 Measure W), the County's Zoning Code, and all other applicable land use regulations and

13 procedures;

14 5. An order invalidating each of the unlawful Project approvals, and/or actions

Re: Notice of Intent to File Lawsuit Under the California Environmental Quality Act

Dear Messrs. Njuyen and Page:

On behalf of the City of Laguna Beach ("City"), and pursuant to Public Resources Code §
21167.5, we are writing to provide the County of Orange ("County") with notice of the City's
intent to file an action under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public
Resources Code § 21000 et seq., challenging the County's certification of Environmental Impact
Report 621 ("EIR") prepared for the West Alton Development Plan project ("Project") and its
approvals for that Project. The Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive and
Declaratory Relief ("Petition") being filed on or before July 5, 2018, identifies, among other
things, numerous procedural and substantive errors, omissions and other problems with the
County's EIR for this Project and its approvals.

As expressed in the Petition, of particular concern to the City are (1) the inadequate
analysis of the Project's significant impacts to the Wildlife Movement Corridor, (2) significant
direct, indirect, and cumulatively significant extra-jurisdictional impacts that will be caused by.
the Project, (3) the lack of any mitigation for those impacts, and (4) the failure to consider
reduced-intensity design alternatives that would cause fewer and less significant impacts. The
City also takes issue with the Project's fundamental inconsistency with Measure W and related
provisions of the County's General Plan.

The Petition will seek the following relief:

1. A stay of the County's decisions certifying the EIR and approving the Project pending
trial;
2. A temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction restraining the County from
taking any actions to carry out the Project relying in whole or in part the challenged
approvals pending trial;

Exhibit A, Page 27

Notice of CEQA Lawsuit Page 2

3. A peremptory writ of mandate, preliminary and permanent injunction and declaratory relief directing the County to:
a. Vacate and set aside its Project approvals;
b. Suspend all Project activity that could result in any change or alteration to the physical environment until the County has taken actions that may be necessary to .bring the Project into compliance with CEQA; and
c. Prepare, circulate, and consider a revised environmental review document and otherwise to comply with CEQA in any subsequent action taken to approve the Project,
4. For the costs of suit;
5. For an award of attorney fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 1021.5 and any other applicable provisions of law or equity; and
6. For any other equitable or legal relief that the Court considers just and proper.
The City urges the County to rescind its Project approvals and revise the EIR prepared for this Project, as required by law. Please do not hesitate to call or otherwise respond if you have any questions or require any further information. Thank you.

Very truly yours,
Dé By
