PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. This petition challenges two decisions by Respondent regarding the Project: the SPR,

3 and certification of the Supplemental Environmental Impact Report (hereinafter referred to as the

4 "SEIR").

5 t 2. Plaintiff A.G. JOHNSON is an individual who has a beneficial interest in and title to

6 improved real property located in close proximity 3000 East Imperial Highway, City of

7 Lynwood, County of Los Angeles, California, ("City") the location of the proposed devclopment

8 which is the subject of this petition.

9 3. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege that 3000 E. IMPERIAL,

10 a LLC ("Real Party") is a California limited liability company owing real property and doing

11 business in the City of Lynwood, in the County of Los Angeles, State of California including in
12 particular a proposal to develop real property located at 3000 East Imperial Highway (hereinafter
13

14 referred to as the "Subject Property.")

15 4. Respondent, the CITY OF LYNWOOD is a municipal corporation, organized and

16 existing under the laws of the state of California, and within the County of Los Angeles

17 (hereinafter referred to as the "Respondent" or "City.")

18 5. Respondent, the CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF LYNWOOD is made up of

19 elected officials who represent the City and take action on behalf of the City, including without
20 limitation: adopting the plans and policies of the City regulating development within the City;
21

22 implementing City's plans and policies regarding the development of land within the City;

23 exercising their discretion over land use applications; protecting the health, safety and welfare of

24 the citizens of the City through the implementation and enforcement of the City's Municipal

25 Code, including its Zoning Ordinances and the California Environmental Quality Act

26 compliance, among other things. The acts of the Respondent City alleged below were taken by
27
2
28
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 its City Council. (The use of the term "Respondents" herein shall refer to both of the

2 respondents: the City and its City Council.)

6. Plaintiffs are ignorant of the true names and capacities of defendants sued herein

4 as DOES 1-10, inclusive, and therefore sues these defendants by such fictitious names. Plaintiffs

5 will amend this complaint to allege the true names and capacities of fictitiously named

6 defendants when ascertained. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege that each
7 defendant designated herein as a DOE is responsible for the events and happenings alleged in
8 this complaint.

9 7. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege that at all times herein
10 mentioned, defendants, and each of them, were the agents, servants, employees, partners, and

11 alter egos of the remaining defendants, that the acts complained of herein were done within the

12 course and scope of said agency, service, employment, and partnership, and that the acts by each
13 defendant were ratified, approved and adopted by each of the remaining defendants. Wherever
14 the term "defendants" is used herein, it shall mean "defendants, and each of them."

15 THE SUBJECT PROPERTY

16 8. The Subject Property is located south of Imperial Highway, west of State Street,
17 and north of Beechwood Avenue, and east of a commercial land use. It rectangular in shape with
18 the long side more or less parallel to and approximately 280 feet from Interstate 105.
19 9. On the LTASP Land Use Diagram, Figure 2.2, the south side of Imperial
20 Highway abutting the Subject Property is designated Open Space
21 10. The closest distance between Metro Green Line station, located at the corner of

22 Long Beach Boulevard and Imperial Highway, and the Subject Property exceeds ½ mile, which
23 is the industry standard utilized in transportation policies and analysis for determining the
24 likelihood of walking access to transit. There are physical barriers increasing the walking
25 distance between the Project and the Metro Green Line station to quite a bit further than ½ mile.
26 11. Directly across the Imperial Highway from the Subject Property, the real property
27

3
28
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

is zoned for Corridor Mixed Use 2. This property is the same distance from the Metro Green

2 Line station as the Subject Property. Petitioner is informed and believes that it has a lower

3 allowable density consisting of approximately 40 dwelling units per acre, than does the Town

4 Center district in light of the distance to the Metro Green Line Station exceeding ½ mile.

S 12. The record states that "there are no bicycle lanes within or adjacent to the Project"

6 THE PROJECT

13. Petitioner is informed and believes that Real Party is the owner in fee of the

8 Subject Property and that in connection with a desire to develop it, Real Party filed an

9 application with the City for a Site Plan Review, SPR 2018-01 (hereinafter referred to as the
10 "SPR"), seeking approval for high-density mixed use development consisting of 348 residential
11 rental units and approximately 26,400 square feet of retail and/or restaurant uses located within a
12 six-story podium style building on an approximately 3.6-acre vacant lot (hereinafter referred to
13 as the "Project.") City estimates that the Project will house approximately 1,500 residents.
14
14. Real Party also filed concurrently with the SPR an application seeking approval of
15

16 a proposed City of Lynwood Transit Area Specific Plan Amendment 2018-01 (hereinafter

17 referred to as the "LTASP Amendment.") The stated purposes for the LTASP Amendment

18 relevant to this petition is to allow the transfer of density from one arca within the geographically

19 defined LTASP area to the Subject Property.

20 CALIFORNIA LAW: THE HIERARCHY IN LAND USE PLANNING

21 GENERAL PLAN

22 15. The legal basis for all land use regulations is the police power of the city

23 to protect the public health, safety and welfare of its residents.

24 16. The police power, even though established by common law, is set forth in

25 the California Constitution, which confers on cities the power to "make and enforce within

26 [their] limits all local police, sanitary and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with

27 general laws. Land use regulations are a manifestation of the local police powers

4
28
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 conferred by the State Constitution and not an exercise of authority delegated by statute.

2 17. The police power is an elastic power. Regulations are sustained under the

3 complex conditions of today which, but a short time a ago, might have been condemned as

4 arbitrary and unreasonable.

5 18. Land use regulations constitute a proper exercise of the police power. A

6 city may exercise its police power to provide a modern, enlightened and progressive community.

7 19. Under state planning law, Government Code Section 65300, each city

8 must adopt a comprehensive, long-term general plan for the physical development of the city.

9 Government Code Section 65302 requires that the plan shall consist of a statement of

10 development policies and shall include diagram or diagrams and a text setting forth objective,

11 principles, standards, and plan proposals. The plan shall consist of seven (7) mandatory elements

12 and any optional element that the city chooses to adopt.

13 20. Government Code Section 65302(a) requires a Land Use Element that

14 identifies the proposed general distribution and intensity of uses of the land for housing,

15 business, industry, open space, natural resources, public facilities and other categories of public

16 and private uses. The Land Use Element serves as the central framework for the entire plan and

17 is intended to correlate all land use issues into a set of coherent development policies. Its goals,

18 objectives, policies, programs, diagrams and maps relate directly to the other elements.

19 21. Government Code Section 65302(b) addresses the requirement for a

20 Circulation Element of the general plan. The circulation system both determines and constrains

21 the pattern and extent of development. Specific circulation components addressed by this

22 element may include, among others, public transit, bicycle facilities, parking, etc.

23 22. Government Code Section 65302(g) requires a Safety Element that

24 establishes policies and programs to protect the community from risks and hazards known to

25 exist in the city. These identified risks to the community inform the preparation of the Land Use

26 Element and other elements of the general plan and must be consulted before making land use

27

28 5

PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 decisions.

2 23. The General Plan, comprised of all of its elements, is the constitution for

3 all future developments within the city to which any local decision affecting land use and
4 development must conform.

5 24. Known as the "consistency doctrine" as set forth in the Government Code,

6 any subordinate land use action, such as a zoning ordinance, subdivision map, development

7 agreement, etc. must be consistent with a current and legally adequate general plan and any such

8 land use action that is not consistent is invalid at the time it is passed. If a conflict is present,

9 under state law, the action is rendered void.

10 25. Although the ultimate decision regarding consistency is legislative, the

11 decision necessitates factual determinations. It is the province of elected city officials to examine

12 the specifics of a proposed project to determine whether it would be in harmony with the policies

13 stated in the plan.

14 26. This means that the documentation supporting the approval or denial of a

15 project must include an explanation of how the city processed the raw evidence to reach its

16 decision. The written determinations, in the form of findings, must expose the city's method of

17 analyzing the facts and regulations and the application of its policies. A city's land use decisions

18 must set forth in writing, especially when acting in an administrative (quasi-judicial) role, how
19 they reached their conclusions.

20 27. There must be evidence in the record to support the findings regarding

21 consistency.

22 SPECIFIC PLANS

23 28. Under Government Code Section 65450, the specific plan is just below the

24 general plan in the land use approval hierarchy and is used for the systematic implementation of

25 the general plan for specific areas. All land projects must be consistent with a specific plan.

26 The specific plan shall specify in detail:

27

6
28
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 1. the distribution, location, and extent of uses of land including open space, within
the area covered by the plan;
2. the proposed distribution, location, and extent and intensity of major components
of public and private transportation and other essential facilities proposed to be
located the area covered by the plan;

6 3. standards and criteria by which development will proceed; and

7 4. a program of implementation measures including regulations, programs, public

8 works project, and financing measures necessary to carry out paragraphs (1), (2)

9 and (3) above.

10 29. In addition to providing implementation measures including regulations,

11 specific plans set standards equivalent to and that act like zoning for all land development within

12 the defined geographic area.

13 30. Indeed, Section 5.4.2 of the LTASP incorporates this aspect of the land

14 use function of a specific plan as follows:

15 The Lynwood Transit Area Specific Plan... functions as the regulatory document

16 that serves as the implementing zoning for the Specific Plan area, thereby ensuring the orderly implementation of the Lynwood General Plan. The Specific

17 Plan establishes the prevailing land use and zoning regulations for all development projects, plans and activities within the Specific Plan area.
18

19 THE CONSISTENCY DOCTRINE

20 31. Under the Government Code, all land use projects must be determined by the

21 approving body as "consistent" with the applicable land use plans of the approving body -

22 known as the "consistency doctrine"

23 32. When a public agency is required to make consistency findings under the

24 Government Code, its job is to balance many, and sometimes, competing goals and policies. This

25 oftentimes leads to implementation of some goals and indifference with respect to others. To the
26 extent an examined project fails to implement policies that are not being advanced by the project,
27
7
28 PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 the law only requires that the project not "obstruct their attainment." In other words there is no

2 legal significance under the Government Code regarding for a project's failure to advance certain

3 identified goals and policies unless the project interferes with or inhibits the achievement of the
goals and policies of the plan.

LYNWOOD'S GENERAL PLAN

6 33. On or about August 2003, City enacted its must recent General Plan called
the Lynwood General Plan - 2020. Petitioner is informed and believes that City has amended its

8 General Plan from time to time since then, including recently adding two new elements set forth
9 below.

10 LYNWOOD'S GENERAL PLAN - CIRCULATION ELEMENT

11 34. With financial assistance received from the Los Angeles County Public
12 Health Department, on or about January 15, 2013, City adopted City Ordinance No. 1656 to
13 amend its mandatory Circulation Element of its General Plan in order to incorporate the Bicycle
14 and Pedestrian Transportation Plan. The stated City's purpose in adopting the Bicycle and
15 Pedestrian Transportation Plan was as follows:
16 develop an official document to guide the development of policies, programs
17 and facilities that foster cycling and walking as healthy, environmentally- sustainable transportation alternatives that reduce traffic congestion and improve
18 character in the community.

19
35.
20 As stated in the Bicycle and Pedestrian Transportation Plan, its policies

21 indicate a commitment to a particular course of action. One of the policies of the Bicycle

22 and Pedestrian Transportation Plan is the commitment to implement a planned citywide

23 network of bicycle and pedestrian improvements stated in the plan.

36.
24 The Lynwood Bicycle And Pedestrian Transportation Plan, adopted in early 2013

25 as an amendment to the City's General Plan, Circulation Element, states:

26 The proposed plan serves as an official policy document guiding the development of policies, programs and facilities that foster cycling and walking
27 as healthy, environmentally sustainable transportation alternatives that reduce
8
28
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

I traffic congestions and improve the character in the community,

2
37.
3 One means to fund the many goals, policies and actions identified in the Bicycle

4 And Pedestrian Transportation Plan is "impact fees" assessed on new development. Another
means to advance the implementation of the Bicycle And Pedestrian Transportation Plan

6 described therein is to require developers to dedicate land toward widening of roadways in

7 order to provide for enhanced bicycle mobility."

8 38. The City of Lynwood General Plan Circulation Element articulates that it is the

9 City's intention to give preference to pedestrian and bicycle users as alternatives to private

10 automobile transportation in its development of a system of roadways

11 See also LTASP Section 1.4: €

12 LYNWOOD'S GENERAL PLAN - HEALTH AND SAFETY ELEMENT

13 39. The following land use policies, regulations, requirements, and standards are
14 examples contained within City's General Plan Safe and Healthy Element are directed at
15
avoiding or mitigating specific environmental effects such as increased traffic, adverse air 16

17 quality, and increasing recreation and open space.

18 40. Further, the City's General Plan, in particular its Safe and Healthy Communities

19 General Plan Element, contains specific requirements, stated in mandatory terms. A list of

20 relevant requirements within that Element of the City's General Plan, without limitation,

21 includes:

22 Policy M-2.2 Bicycle network. Coordinate with the Los Angeles County
23 Metropolitan Transportation Authority's (Metro) Active Transportation Strategic Plan (ATSP) and the City's Bicycle and Pedestrian Transportation Plan to 24 establish a complete bicycle network along designated roadways and provide
25 connections to other modes of travel;
Policy M-2.3 Development requirements. Require that all land use and
26 development projects accommodate active transportation by incorporating, enhancing, or connecting existing or planned pedestrian and bicycle networks;
27 Policy M-4.5 Pedestrian environment. Encourage street-level building

28 9

PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 features, street furniture . to encourage the appeal of pedestrian environments; Goal M.5 Reduced Car Dependency. Provide a connected, balanced, and
2 integrated transportation system of bicycle and pedestrian networks that enable

3 residents to walk and bike as alternatives to use of the car;
Policies M-5.1 - M-5.5. of the Safe and Healthy Communities, General

4 Plan Element;
Goal M.9 Walkability. Create a high-quality pedestrian network and urban design in all areas of the City so that residents can safely and comfortably walk to their destinations; and Policy M-9.1 Pedestrian infrastructure. Develop supportive pedestrian facilities such as benches, street trees, and trash cans throughout the City to
encourage walking.

8

9 41. The consistent theme in these two recently land use plans adopted at least in part

10 to comply with State law regarding land use as an important element in reaching State carbon

11 reduction plans is to reduce automobile use thereby improving traffic and air quality. These

12 purposes clearly constitute land use plans

13 42. In addition to the addition of the two new land use elements to the City's General

14 Plan, City has adopted two specific plans that are also designed to assist the City with

15 compliance with State laws focused on reducing discharge of carbon dioxide, greenhouse gas
16 and other causes of global warming.
17 LNYWOOD'S SPECIFIC PLANS
18
LYNWOOD'S LONG BEACH BOULEVARD SPECIFIC PLAN
19
43. The Long Beach Boulevard Specific Plan (hereinafter referred to as the
20

21 "LBBSP") is the regulatory document that serves as the implementing zoning for the Specific

22 Plan area,

23 44. On or about November, 2006, City enacted the Long Beach Boulevard

24 Specific Plan. The Subject Property is located within the geographic area defined by the Long

25 Beach Boulevard Specific Plan and therefore is subject to its goals, policies, plans, and

26 requirements.

27 45. The LTASP, including its Amendment, do not supersede the Long Beach

10
28
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 Boulevard Specific Plan which still applies to land use decisions applicable to the Project. The

2 Long Beach Boulevard Specific Plan provides that TOD (transit-oriented development) shall
occur within ¼ mile of the Metro Green Line. The Project clearly does not comply with the

4 standard established in the Long Beach Boulevard Specific Plan of ¼ mile to any state defined
5 46. The following are examples contained within City's Long Beach
6 Boulevard Specific Plan of land use policies, regulations, requirements, and standards directed at
7 avoiding or mitigating specific environmental effects such as increased traffic, adverse air
8 quality, and increasing recreation and open space.
Long Beach Boulevard Specific Plan Section 1.4.3 Circulation Element states:
10 The (Long Beach Boulevard) Specific Plan will provide for an attractive well-
11 connected street and pedestrian system that accommodates the needs of all users, including pedestrians and cyclists, and strengthens the access to the Green Line
12 light rail on I-105. The Specific Plan focuses on the following goals and policies from the General Plan:
13 Policy CIR-1.5: Pedestrian-Friendly Systems. Establish street sections in

14 residential neighborhoods and certain commercial areas that, while
accommodating vehicular traffic, give preference to pedestrian users.'
15 Goal CIR-2: accommodate alternatives to private automobile
16 transportation that meet the need of all City residents.

17

18 Long Beach Boulevard Specific Plan Section 5.3.8 states:
City of Lynwood has all the ingredients necessary to become a great "bicycle 19 friendly" community. The Metro Bus and the Green Line allow bicycles onboard

20 without permits. Existing issues such as air quality, traffic congestion, lack of parking and quality of life help foster the exploration of innovative approaches to
21 building a city.. the goal is to create a strong bicycle/pedestrian program that will enable residents of Lynwood to use their bicycles in a safe and efficient
22 manner. the project area requires improvements for bicycle transportation

23 that provide direct and convenient access to major activity centers. *

24 The following bicycle parking requirements shall apply: Residential. Minimum of one Class I bicycle parking space per unit.
25

26 The LBBSP repeats the City's preference for pedestrian and bicycle users in its expression of its intention to provide alternatives to private automobile transportation in its future system of roadways that also accommodate 27 vehicle traffic.

11 28
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 Long Beach Boulevard Specific Plan Section 6.5.7 states:

2 Project located in the Specific Plan area are required to construct infrastructure and other facilities as a part of their project approval when such
3 improvements are directly related to their project.

4

47. Under the Long Beach Boulevard Specific Plan, the Project is located

6 within the sub geographic area described as the "Downtown Vitlage Ii area" (See Figure"
The following design guidelines apply to Village II:

8 Minimum sidewalk width: 18 feet.
Planting width: 3-4 feet.
9 e Planting Materials: Figures 5.6 through 5.10 illustrate the landscape plan

10 for Downtown Village II.
Street Furnishings: Street lighting, outdoor seating, bicycle racks, trash

11 receptacle, and other amenities are provided on the sidewalk.
Street Intersections: Pedestrian bulb-outs should be considered to reduce
12. pedestrian crossing distance and time. This also improves pedestrian visibility.

13 48. The Long Beach Boulevard Specific Plan, like Section 3.7.1 Planned
14 Pedestrian Improvements of the LTASP discussed below, contains virtually the same

15 requirements regarding the enhancement of pedestrian safety that is applicable at the intersection

16 of State Street and Imperial Highway, the major intersection immediately adjacent to the Project.

17 2016 LTASP

18 49. LTASP adopted on or about September 6, 2016, by Ordinance No. 2016-191.

19 Major funding for the creation of the LTASP, $800,000, carne from a Los Angeles Metro

20 Transit-Oriented Development planning grant. The LTASP states that the grant award
21 recognized the importance of creating transit-oriented development around the Metro station.
22
50. Although the geographically defined area greatly exceeds the ½/ mile radius
23
clearly illustrated in Figure 2-2 the Land Use Diagram, the focus of the LTASP is to enhance
24
development opportunities within the ½ radius of the Metro Green Line station in order to induce
25

26 and facilitate reduced dependence on the automobile trips.

51. Section 5.4.2 of the LTASP states:
27

12 28
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

The Lynwood Transit Area Specific Plan.. . functions as the regulatory document that serves as the implementing zoning for the Specific Plan area,

52. Consistent with the County Transit-Oriented Development planning grant,

4 the LTASP states its purpose is to:

Encourage a land use framework that emphasizes a compact, urban form that relies less heavily on the private automobile. Building on goals, policies and development standards established in the City's General Plan (adopted 2002) and the Long Beach Boulevard Specific Plan (adopted 2006) the LTASP will facilitate the formation of transit-oriented communities ... close to the Metro Green Line
8 station.

53. In addition to providing a land use framework the LTASP emphasizes mobility

10 options such as walking, biking, and carpooling. Its focused function throughout the plan is to

11 reduce reliance on the automobile.

12

13 54. This very focused function is achieved by three principal programs: a)bicycle and

14 pedestrian infrastructure changes; b) parking management; and c) Transportation Demand

15 Management (known in the industry and referred to herein as "TDM")

16
55. TDM largely consists of incentives to get people out of their cars and into
17 alternative modes of travel whether it be transit, walking, biking, or shared ride services. (pages
18
47-48.
19

20 56. A very clear statement about the LTASP TDM goals is as follows:

21 The LTASP is designed to promote the use of alternative local and

22 regional modes of transportation in-lieu (sic.) of continuous private automobile use. Regardless of the specific service or mode, increasing the use of alternative
23 forms of transportation is an essential element in meeting local and regional planning objectives (such as improving traffic flow), environmental objectives
24 (such as improving air quality). . . Amended LTASP Section 3.9.1.

25 57. The means to accomplish these goals includes infrastructure changes to enhance

26 the safety, availability and enjoyment of walking and biking; parking management strategies and

27
13
28 PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 Transportation Demand Management (referred to in the industry as TDM.)

2 58. Section 5.4.2 of the LTASP spells out its equivalent function to zoning as

3 follows:

4 The Lynwood Transit Area Specific Plan.. functions as the regulatory document

5 that serves as the implementing zoning for the Specific Plan area, thereby ensuring the orderly implementation of the Lynwood General Plan. The Specific

6 Ptan establtshes the prevaiting land use and zoning regutations for att
development projects, plans and activities within the Specific Plan area.
7

8 59. LTASP Section 1.1 states:

The Specific Plan's vision for development is focused on the area around the Metro Green Line station (Figure 1-2, LTASP Planning Boundary) and is
10 intended to contribute to the City's focus on creating transit oriented

11 communities. Therefore, the planning boundary generally contains properties
within a half mile radius of the station.

12

13 60. In order to fully implement the many goals, policies, programs, and standards of

14 the LTASP, it states:

15 The Specific Plan requires that a property owner or developer .. . assume

16 the primary responsibility for implementing future project development according to and in conformance with, the design intent of the Specific Plan. . ." (Emphasis

17 added.)

18 61. Conformance is commonly defined as:
19 O to act in accordance or harmony; comply (usually followed by to): to conform
20 to rules.
0 to act
21 in accord with the prevailing standards, attitudes, practices, etc., of a society or a group: One has to conform in order to succeed in this company.

22 O to be or become similar in form, nature, or character.

23
62. Although the ink was barely dry on the 2016, LTASP, Real Party applied for an
24 amendment as a part of its application for the SPR. An examination of the changes made in the
25
LTASP Design Standards and to the EIR City had certified in connection with the 2016 LTASP,
26

27 demonstrate it was to greatly expanding the allowable development envelope at the Subject

14
28
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 Property.

AMENDED LTASP -2018

3 63. The stated purpose for amending the LTASP is specifically to: raise maximum

4 height, building form and general design, allow for density transfer, reduce minimum unit size,
5 reduce minimum open space, reduce minimum floor-to-floor heights, reduce minimum set backs
6 and reduce parking standards as set forth in the Design Standards.
7 64. The strategy to accomplish this goal was to hold constant the total amount of
8 growth that would be allowed in the LTASP defined geographic area, but allow that it be
9
allocated disparately on a first come first serve basis. In other words, the total (or average) 10
density for the entire LTASP defined geographic area was the same both before and after the 11

12 amendment, but the maximum allowable density for any one site was greatly increased.

65.
13 The flaw in this amendment (elaborated on below), evaluated from the point of

14 view of achieving the City's land use polices and goals, achieving compliance with State Law

15 directed at achieving carbon reduction, and achieving the City's land use polices and goals set

16 forth in applicable Regional plans directed as assisting the State to reach these goals is that not

17 every piece of property located within the LTASP defined geographic area is similarly situated

18 with respect to the central focus of the LTASP- the Metro Green Line Station.

19 66. As amended, the LTASP contained many land use polices and goals directed at
20 improving the environment that remained applicable to the Subject Property. The following

21 constitutes a partial list of infrastructure requirements that the LTASP directs must be integrated

22 into the Project:

23 The Imperial Highway for the entire distance of the frontage of the Subject
24 Property is subject to the Open Space Designation supported by greenspace, street
25 furniture (benches, trash and recycling receptacles), and public art;
26
Regarding the portion of the Imperial Highway that the Subject Property directly 27

28 15

PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

3

4 68. The LTASP essentially overlays a portion of the Long Beach Boulevard Specific

5 Plan (LTASP section 1.4.), without superseding the later. Therefore, both are applicable to the

6 Subject Property and the requirements of both must be considered and adhered to.

7 69. LTASP Section 3.7.1 Planned Pedestrian Improvements of the LTASP discussed

8 below, contains virtually the same requirements as the Long Beach Boulevard Specific Plan

9 regarding the enhancement of pedestrian safety that is applicable at the intersection of State

10 Street and Imperial Highway, the major intersection immediately adjacent to the Project.
11 LYNWOOD'S MUNICIPAL CODE - ZONING

12 70. The Amended LTASP constitutes the applicable zoning for the Subject Property.

13 (LTASP Section 5.4.2) The Amended LTASP states that wherever the City's zoning code is not
14 modified by the specific plan, then the citywide zoning standards shall govern development (Id.)
15

16 Section LTASP Section 5.5 makes the City's design review process under Municipal Code Sections 25-applicable, which will include a detailed review of
17 each project pursuant to all applicable conditions of approval and provisions of the Specific Plan. The design review and approval will result in a
18 recommendation to the City Staff confirming the conformance of each individual
19 development proposal with the standards and guidelines of the Specific Plan..

25 HISTORY OF PROJECT REVIEW

26 72. On or about November, 2017, the Respondent's Planning Commission considered

27
17
28 PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 and approved Real Party's applications to build the Project based on its application for the SPR

2. and certification of compliance with CEQA for the a SPR based on a mitigated negative

3 declaration (hereinafter referred to as the "MND.")

73. Petitioner appealed both of those two November 2017 actions taken by the

6 Respondent's-Planning Commission alteging, among other grounds, that the proposed findings

7. for the many variances requested were not supported by the facts and legal inadequacies of the

8 MNS. Real Party also filed an appeal but only challenging certain conditions of approval of the

9 SPR. Both actions were later superseded and abandoned by Real Party and Respondent as set

10 forth below.

11 74. On or about April 4, 2018, Real Party re-filed an application for an SPR,
12
requesting the Project in exactly the same form as previously approved by the Planning
13

14 Commission, and instead of variance, Rcal Party sought "associated amendments" to the LTASP

15 "pertaining to development standards" and "changes to the adoption and administrative
16 processes of the plan."

17 75. On or about June 20, 2018, the City published a Notice of Availability of the

18 SEIR for the two requested actions. Respondents contend that the final date for comment on the

19 SEIR was August 6, 2018.
20
76. On August 6, 2018, at a public hearing, Respondent's Planning Commission again
21

22 considered and adopted resolutions recommending that the City Council adopt the SPR, the draft

23 SEIR, the proposed amendments to the LTASP.

24 77. Written opposition, including several letters raising points of opposition to the

25 SPR and the inadequacies of the SEIR as it related to the SPR were timely filed on behalf of

26 Petitioner and were a part of the record before the Planning Commission voted in favor of its
27

18
28
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 recommendations.

2 78. Petitioner appeared at the Planning Commission's August 6, 2018, at a public

3 hearing on these two matters and orally raised additional points in opposition.

4
79. On or about August 21, 2018, Respondent City Council convened a public
5
hearing to consider the Planning Commission's August 6, 2018 recommendations to approve the
6

7 Planning Commission's August 6, 2018 to approve the SPR, and certify the SEIR for both the

8 SPR and the amended LTASP. The certifying Resolution refers to as these two components as:

9 the "Modified Project" consisting of the "amended LTASP" and the Plaza Mexico Residences."

10 80. Again, many points of opposition were filed on behalf of Petitioner in writing in

11 advance of Respondent City Council's August 21, 2018 public hearing. Again, Petitioner
12 appeared at the public hearing and orally raised additional points in opposition to the approval of
13

14 the SPR, and to the certification of the SEIR for the SPR.

15 81. Over Petitioner's objections, Respondent adopted resolutions granting
16 discretionary approval of the SPR and certifying that the SEIR complied with CEQA both as to

17 the Amended LTASP (not challenged here) and for purposes of approving the SPR.

18 82. The allegations herein refer to information contained in numerous documents that

19 relate to the issues in this lawsuit. These documents will be filed as part of the record of

20 proceedings before the City, and are incorporated into this petition by reference.

21 |EXHAUSTION

22 83. By Petitioner's efforts to seek changes to both the proposed SPR and the proposed
23 certification of CEQA for the SPR in reliance on the SEIR in writing and orally, Petitioner has
24

25 exhausted her administrative remedies in connection with raising these issues herein.

26 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

27 (Against all Respondents for Failures to Comply with City's Requirements)
19
28 PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

2 84. Plaintiffs repeat, reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation

3 contained in Paragraphs 1 - 83, inclusive, as though fully set forth herein.

4 85. The City has abused its discretion by failing to proceed in the manner required

5 law by taking the various actions set forth above to grant Real Party in Interest the SPR

6 86. There is nothing in the record that demonstrates any compliance with Amended
7
LTASP Sections 5.4.3 and 5.5 imposing a requirement of full compliance with Sections 25-3-14
8
through 25-3-20 of Article 3 of the Lynwood Zoning Code. Nor is there anything that excuses
9
compliance with those requirements.
10
87.
11 The Project could not be approved under these requirements because the

12 conditions of approval for the SPR do not require any conformance with the many provisions of

13 the Specific Plan involving implementation of infrastructure for bike and pedestrian

14 improvements or the implementation of TDM.

15 88. Therefore based on this failure to comply with the requirement of the Amended

16 LTASP, the Project does not comply with all applicable laws set forth in the Amended LTASP

17 and it cannot be approved at the present time based on this record.

18 89. The Amended LTASP did not delete or otherwise change the requirements

19 that each property owner or developer, take the primary responsibility for implementing future

20 project development according to, and in conformance with, the design intent of the Specific
21
Plan.
22
90.
23 A partial list of implementation requirements regarding bicycle and pedestrian

24 infrastructure improvements required in relation to the development of the Subject Property at or

25 adjacent to it include, without limitation:

26 greenspace, street furniture (benches, trash and recycling receptacles), and public

27

20
28
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

art for the entire frontage of the Subject Property at The Imperial Highway;

2 reduced vehicle travel lane widths and widen the sidewalks of Imperial Highway

3 for the entire frontage of the Subject Property.
Provide a high level of pedestrian amenities for the entire frontage of the Subject
Property, including without limitation:

6 O Provide pedestrian crosswalks at all intersections;

o Install bulb-outs to improve safety;

8
91. A partial list of implementation requirements regarding TDM includes, without
9
limitation:
10 o Introductory Transportation Information Packet provided to all residents;
11

O
12 Carpool/ Vanpool/Ridematching Services to match residents to reduce

13 drive alone trips;

O
14 Subsidized Transit Pass for bus and rail for residents

15 O Work closely with key neighborhoods, business and the City to develop an

16 efficient and financially feasible TDM program;

17 O Work closely with transit service providers and the City to assure transit

18 infrastructure and service will meet the needs of people who live, work

19 and shop within the LTASP; and

20 o Utilize similar standards of urban design and architectural quality for the

21 transit infrastructure

22 92. The LTASP adopted in 2016, set forth Mitigation Measures T-1(a) through T-1(f)

23 which mitigation measures shall be incorporated into any future development project

24 proposed in the (LTASP) Plan Area to the greatest extent feasible. (Emphasis added.)
25 93. The 2016 LTASP stated:

26 the Specific Plan requires the implementation of various
27 Transportation Demand management improvement measures to roadway segment
21
28
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

infrastructure, and transit, bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure improvements
within the Plan Area. (Emphasis added.)
2

3 94. However, the SEIR for the Amendment to the 2016 LTASP terminated the

4 required implementation language of the LTASP Mitigation Measures. Specifically, the required
5 Mitigation Measures at T-1(e) and T-1(f) were simply lined out, deleting those requirements and
6 thereby substantially changing the efficacy of the 2016 LTASP in fact if not in the language of
7
the plan.
8
95. Specifically, whereas in the 2016 LTASP stated that implementation measures
9
shall be incorporated into any future development project" (emphasis added) the
10

11 elimination of these previously required Mitigation Measures T-1(a) and T-1(e), the SEIR for the

12 Amended LTASP, gutted the implementation of the LTASP. In its place, the SEIR shifted

13 responsibility to the City for the implementation of the infrastructure and TDM elements of the

14 LTASP. The change eliminated the factual nexus between project impacts and mitigation;

15 introduced uncertainty about the timing of any mitigation, if it will ever occur; shifted the cost

16 from the developer to the taxpayers; and allowed unmitigated environmental impacts to occur.

17 96. The remaining language after the deletions of the implementation requirements is

18 obviously not any form of mitigation. What was previously a mitigation measure is now

19 advisory. What once was an obligation of the devcloper based on a nexus with evcry future
20 development project became a non-binding and vague obligation of the City.

21 97. With respect to the elimination of the previous LTASP implementation

22 requirements, Mitigation Measures T-1(a) and T-1(e), regarding bike and pedestrian

23 infrastructure and TDM, there is nothing in the record that demonstrates any compliance with
24 these implementation measures will ever occur.
25
98. Nor is there anything in the record that shows that the impacts on the environment
26
of the elimination of the previous LTASP implementation requirements, Mitigation Measures T-
27

22
28
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1(a) and T-1(e) was even considered.

99. It may be presumed that LTASP implementation requirements, Mitigation

3 Measures T-1(a) and T-1(e) were written into the EIR to mitigate identified impacts. It may not

4 be presumed that their elimination does not have the potential to cause a significant impact on
5 the environment.

6 100. Nor is there anything in the record or in the Amended LTASP that excuses
7 compliance with those requirements. Therefore the Project cannot be approved at the present
8 time based on this record because it does not comply with these foundational elements of the
9
LTASP.
10
101. The elimination of the LTASP implementation requirements, Mitigation 11

12 Measures T-1(a) and T-1(e) as stated in the SEIR, materially contradicts the goals and policies of

13 the LTASP regarding mobility - a central element of the plan.

14 102. By eliminating Transportation Mitigation Measure T-1(a) through Mitigation

15 Measures T-1(f), previously requirement that must be implemented as a condition of approval

16 in each new development project, the SEIR for the Amended LTASP dramatically reduces the

17 efficacy of the specific plan measured in light of its goals and purpose. This constitutes a "major

18 change" as defined under CEQA and therefore, use of a supplemental EIR was not appropriate.

19 103. This deletion of these primary implementation mitigation measures from this
20 Project constitutes a de facto an improper exception, exemption or other form of allowance to

21 evade the substantive land use policies, plans, goals, standards and requirements of the LTASP,
22 and these same land use policies articulated in many of the City's other land use plans.
23 Therefore, the Project is not in compliance with the equivalence of the zoning requirements of
24 development within the geographically defined area of the Amended LTASP, or any of the
25 City's related land use plans. This noncompliance with the Amended LTASP constitutes an
26 abuse of discretion, failure to proceed in a manner required by law.
27

28 23

PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 104. The Project was required to re-strip in order to add a westbound right turn lane at

2 State Street and Imperial Highway. This specific requirement will decrease the area within the

3 existing traffic lanes at Imperial Highway and State Street that is designated for bicycles and

4 pedestrian safety measures. For example, this condition of the Project conflicts with the many
implementation standards including; to widen the sidewalks, creatc bulb-outs, and crcatc a

6 designated striped bike lane along the curb consistent with the standards of a Class II Bike lane,

7 all of which are proscribed for State Street at the intersection with Imperial Highway. This will
8 materially interfere with the requirement to implement the Bike Path provided in both the
9 LTASP and the Bicycle and Pedestrian Transportation Plan of the City's General Plan
10
Circulation Element.
11
105.
12 This condition elevates automobile mobility over pedestrian and bicycle mobility

13 and is materially inconsistent with the repeatedly stated purpose of the LTASP. The LTASP

14 states that under the Respondent's Circulation of its General Plan, it is the City's intention to

15 give preference to pedestrian and bicycle users. .." over private automobile transportation.

16 106. Each of the many failures to comply with applicable land use plans, policies,

17 standards, requirements, and guidelines identified above constitute a failure to comply with the

18 Zoning Laws applicable to the Subject Property and therefore constitute an abuse of discretion.

19 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

20 (Against all Respondents for Failures to Comply with CEQA)

21 107. Plaintiffs repeat, reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation

22 contained in Paragraphs 1 - 106, inclusive, as though fully set forth herein.

23 108. The California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code, Sections

24 21000, et seq., "CEQA") imposes on defendants duty to investigate and wherever feasible to

25 mitigate to a level of insignificance all of the environmental impacts of its projects before

26 approving any project. CEQA imposes many substantive duties which the City must comply with

27

24
28
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

to ensure that all projects built subject to its jurisdiction have incorporated all feasible measures

2 that can mitigate identified environmental impacts and where not feasible, that a statement of

3 overriding considerations justifying such approval.

4 109. The City has abused its discretion by failing to proceed in the manner required
5 law by taking the various actions set forth above to grant Real Party in Interest the Entitlements,
6 including the certification of EIR, adopting the Findings and Statement of Overriding
7 Considerations and adopting the Statement of Overriding Considerations; certifying compliance
8 with CEQA of the EIR, and by authorizing the issuance of the permits and development
9
authorizations relating to the Project. The City has acted contrary to CEQA and Public Resources 10
Code Sections 21000 et.
11 seq. and land use ordinances, and other statutes and stated policies that

12 the govern land use and land use decisions within the City of Los Angeles in various ways

13 involving failures to meet the substantive requirements under CEQA. The following is an effort

14 to organize these many legal failures into identified environmental impacts as discussed in the

15 EIR for the Project. CEQA defines a project as the wholc of the action which has a potential for

16 resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment, or reasonably foreseeable

17 indirect physical change in the environment.

18 110. The term project refers to the activity that is being approved and that may be

19 subject to several discretionary approvals by a government agency. Other examples of a project

20 may include amending land use plans, including a specific plan.
21
111. Here, on August 21, 2018 (see details below), Respondent adopted 2 separate
22
resolutions approving 2 different projects as defined in CEQA: a) a discretionary approval to 23

24 build the Project; and an related amendment of specific plan that relates to both the Project and

25 additionally to a much larger geographic area at the same time. The former involves only the

26 development of a single approximately 4-acre lot. The criteria for consideration of the SPR are

27

28 25

PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 set forth at Respondent's Municipal Code. The later involves an amendment to a City land use

2 plan that is applicable to specifically defined large geographic acre area consisting of

3 approximately 316 acres and involving many properties and many property owners, and the

4
criteria for consideration of the amendment to a specific plan are set forth at Respondent's

• Municipal Code.

112. For these reasons, they are different projects under CEQA.

8 113. This petition challenges the environmental compliance regarding these two

9 actions taken by Respondent based on many failures to comply with CEQA.

10 114. Section IX Land Use, subsection b) of the CEQA Guidelines Appendix G, which

11 serves as a model for making the determination when any environmental impact is typically
12 "significant" (often referred to as the Thresholds of Significance), states:
13 Would the project:
14
Conflict with any applicable land use plan, policy or regulation of an agency with
15 jurisdiction over the project (including, but not limited to the general plan,

16 specific plan, zoning ordinance) adopted for the purpose of avoiding or
mitigating an environmental effect.

17

18 115. The theoretical underpinning of the "consistency" analysis owed under the
Government-Code-is not-the same as that which underlies the statutery duties owed-under

20 CEQA. These are two entirely separate and different statutory duties. They serve independent

21 a functions. There is a material difference between the findings of project's "consistency"

22 regarding applicable land use plans on the one hand and the analytical requirements of CEQA.

23 116. a When a public agency is required to make consistency findings under the

24 Government Code, its job is to balance many, and sometimes, competing goals and policies. This

25 oftentimes leads to implementation of some goals and indifference with respect to others. To the

26 extent an examined project fails to implement policies that are not being advanced by the project,
27

26
28
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 the law only requires that the project not "obstruct their attainment." In other words there is no

2 legal significance under the Government Code regarding for a project's failure to advance certain

3 identified goals and policies unless the project interferes with or inhibits the achievement of the

4 goals and policies of the plan.

5 117. The purpose of CEQA is entirely different. Its purpose is to identify the potential
6 for significant environmental impacts. The "consistency doctrine" under the Government Code
7 has no place in discharging this duty.
8
118. Therefore, the City is simply wrong in the many instances stated within
Responses to Comments that because the general impacts of the Specific Plan have already been 10

11 certified and because the Project is "consistent" (using the legal definition of consistency under

12 the Government Code) no further environmental analysis is necessary.

119.
13 In other words, land use impacts generally must be regarded as significant if any

14 proposed project does not comply with "... any applicable land use plan, policy or regulation ...

15 avoiding or mitigating an environmental effect".

16 120. Each of the above identified failures to comply with applicable land use plans,

17 policies, standards, requirements, and guidelines constitute a failure to comply with the Zoning

18 Laws (or equivalency) applicable to the Subject Property also constitute a significant land use

19 impact under CEQA which were not adequately identified, analyzed, and mitigated.

20 121. It is beyond dispute that the relevant land use plans identified herein were adopted

21 for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating specific environmental effects including addressing

22 increased traffic, adverse air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, and the scarcity of recreation and

23 open space.

24 122. Neither the SEIR nor any other part of the record contains any discussion of the
25 conflicts/inconsistencies identified herein in this section of the petition.
26
123. This failure constitutes a material failure to comply with the law under CEQA to
27

28 27

PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 fully consider all of the relevant environmental impacts of the Project, including without

2 limitation, significant land use impacts.

3 124. Failure to identify, analyze, and mitigate each of the many examples of the failure

4 of the Project to fully comply with the requirements of the City's various land use plans

5 identified in the previous paragraphs 84-106, constitutes a conflict with any applicable land use
plan, policy or regulation, therefore, a significant land use impact that was never considered in
the SEIR. This constitutes an abuse of discretion and failure to proceed in a manner required
8
under CRQA.
9 125. Without legal justification, in the Responses to Comments City state that
10
implementation of the LTASP will not occur in connection with the implementation of the
11
Project. The Conditions of Approval for the Project do not impose the many relevant policies,
12

13 regulations, requirements, and standards directed at avoiding or mitigating specific

14 environmental effects such as increased traffic, adverse air quality, and increasing recreation and

15 open space stated in the LTASP.

16 126. City takes the position in the SEIR that impact fees and/or dedication of land will

17 not be used to implement the goals and policies of the LTASP; that implementation of the

18 LTASP will occur later by the City's own funding.

19 127. Because the Project will not be constructing or contributing funds towards the

20 implementation of the Bicycle and Pedestrian Transportation Plan, the LTASP and the LBBSP

21 bicycle and pedestrian projects implementing, it is in conflict or at least inconsistent with all of

22
these land use plans. In addition, the Project conflicts with all of the Respondent's many
23
similarly stated goals, polices, land use plans and regulations stated in, without limitation the
24

25 City of Lynwood Bicycle + Pedestrian Transportation Plan; Lynwood Connectivity Plan

26 (February 2017); Lynwood Complete Streets Policies; Safe and Healthy Communities, General

27

28 28
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 Plan Element; and the Long Beach Boulevard Specific Plan.

2 128. Each of these plans contains a similar emphasis on creating and or enhancing

3 mobility alternatives to the automobile including walking, biking, and access to transit in order to

4 decrease traffic, improve air quality including decreasing greenhouse gas impacts, and improve
5
open space/recreation opportunities.
6

129. Each of these failures to comply with each of these land use plans, policies and

8 regulations constitutes a separate significant land use impact that requires identification, analysis,

9 and consideration of mitigation.

10 130. However, the SEIR for the Amended LTASP included an extreme departure from

11 these required implementation measures by deleting them as and shifting the burden from the

12 developers to the City in the form of a nonbinding effort to (continue) to funding.

13 131. The record contains no indication when, if ever, the many requirements and

14 policies stated in City's land use plans will be implemented. CEQA requires certainty that

15 identified impacts will be mitigated. An unmitigated significant impact that may or may not be
16 mitigated is not permissible under CEQA.
17 132. In an extraordinary step, Respondents in the SEIR for the Amended LTASP
18 deleted fundamental Mitigation Measure T-1(e) and Mitigation Measure T-1(f). These mitigation
19 measures were identified in the EIR for the 2016 LTASP as necessary to mitigate the impacts of
20 development within the geographic plan area. Nothing is contained in the record to indicate a
21

22 change in circumstances to obviate their necessity.

133.
23 This profound change in the applicable land use and mitigation policies applicable

24 to the Subject Property occurred without any mention (apart from a line through the previous

25 language, analysis, supporting evidence, or conclusion.

26 134. Their elimination constitutes a material departure from the prior land use policy

27 and therefore raises the issue of a potential significant land use impact that was not

29
28 PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 properly addressed in the SEIR. This too constitutes a failure to proceed in a manner required by

2 law under CEQA.

3 135. There no longer is any linkage between project-generated impacts and the

4 implementation of the LTASP necessary to mitigate impacts caused by the project. Developers

5 were given a free pass regarding previously required TDM and Non-Motorized transportation

infrastructure mitigation measures. Other than this petition for administrative writ, the citizens

7 have no recourse to address the detrimental impacts on the environment (especially traffic and air
8 quality) the SEIR identifies that will go unmitigated.
9
136. The findings in the EIR for the 2016 LTASP regarding the significance of the
10
project after mitigation were dependent on these implementation requirements are no longer true.
11

12 There is nothing stated in the SEIR that would support the conclusion that the bicycle and

13 pedestrian infrastructure policies and programs will ever be implemented. Without

14 implementation requirements, and without direct linkage to the development that causes the

15 impacts, Mitigation Measures T-1(e) and T-1(e) are mere statements of aspiration.

16 137. Changes in the infrastructure to implement the land use plans and policies

17 intended to increase alternatives to the use of the automobile will not be implemented, or are at

18 best uncertain as to when if ever they will be implemented in connection with future
19 development within the LTASP area and the Project itself. CEQA does not allow apirational
20 statements in lieu of actual commitments to mitigation.

21 138. The SEIR admits that the traffic and transportation impacts would be "significant

22 and unavoidable, even with mitigation." CEQA requires that every feasible mitigation measure

23 be considered prior to overriding unmitigated impacts. The elimination of these Mitigation

24 Measure T-1(e) and Mitigation Measure T-1(f), which were implementation mitigation

25 requirements, cannot be excused without finding and adequate support that they are infeasible.
26 This did not occur in the SEIR or anywhere else in the record.
27

30
28
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

139. Without any analysis and evidentiary support for deleting Mitigation Measure T-

2 1(e) and Mitigation Measure T-1(f), there is no evidentiary support for the Statement of

3 Overriding Considerations. The SEIR fails as an information document regarding the

4 Amendment to the LTASP and therefore is legally inadequate to support the approval of the
5 Project.

6 140. The SEIR falsely states that the Amended LTASP does not materially change
7 from the 2016 LTASP with respect to CEQA Thresholds of Significance XV (g)
8
141. Without Mitigation Measure T-I(e) and Mitigation Measure T-1(f), the Amended
9 LTASP is in conflict with the established CEQA Thresholds of Significance XV (g) because it 10

11 eliminated the implementation requirements of the Bicycle and Pedestrian Infrastructure and

12 TDM linked to the Project.

142.
13 Indeed, the SEIR is materially misleading about the deletion of Mitigation

14 Measure T-1(e) and Mitigation Measure T-1(f) in the Amended LTASP. For example, at Table

15 7-1, the discussion about the impacts of the Project on traffic with respect to CEQA Thresholds

16 of Significance XV (g), the SEIR states that as a part of the project, specific improvements

17 implementing the bike and pedestrian infrastructure at the Imperial Highway, State Street, and
18 Beechwood Avenue will be constructed.

19 143. However, none of those improvements described in Table 7-1, as generally
20 described above is set forth in the Conditions of Approval for the Project.

21 144. Therefore, the Project in fact does conflict with adopted policies, plans or

22 programs regarding public transit, bicycle or pedestrian facilities including without limitation the

23 2016 LTASP, the City's General Plan Circulation Element (Bicycle and Pedestrian

24 Transportation Element, City's General Plan Safety and Health Element, the Long Beach
25 Boulevard Specific Plan, among others. In addition, the revocation of the requirement to
26 impose Mitigation Measures T-1(a) through T-1(f) as conditions of new development projects
27

28 31

PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

conflicts with all of the Respondent's many similarly stated goals, polices, land use plans and
regulations stated in its Long Beach Boulevard Specific Plan, General Plan - Safety and Health

3 Element, General Plan - Bicycle and Pedestrian Transportation Plan Amendment to the

4 Circulation Element, among others as set forth below. Likewise, these material changes in the

5 Amended LTASP through the SEIR constitutc significant land usc impacts.

6 145. It is stated in the EIR for the LTASP, that Mitigation Measures T-1(a) through T-

7 1(f) were an integral part of the California Emissions Estimator Model to identify reductions in

8 vehicle miles travelled. The elimination of these mitigation measures changes the variables of the
model and renders its prior conclusions no longer valid and irrelevant. There is no replacement
10
for them in the SEIR.
11
146. Furthermore, neither the EIR for the LTASP nor the SEIR examined the possible
12

13 VMT Reductions from Project Design Features regarding the Project. In fact, the SEIR is silent

14 on that subject.

15 147. Each of the many above-stated provisions of the 2016 LTASP, including
16 Mitigation Measures T-1(a)through T-1(f) as conditions of new development projects directly

17 involves the failure to fully implement, by abdication. the LTASP land use policies, regulations,

18 requirements, and standards directed at avoiding or mitigating specific environmental effects
19 such as increased traffic, adverse air quality, and increasing recreation and open space
20 specifically at those portions of streets that are immediately adjacent to the Project.

21 148. Nevertheless, the Conditions of Approval do not require compliance with any of

22 these regulations, requirements, and standards directed at avoiding or mitigating specific

23 environmental effects such as increased traffic, adverse air quality, and increasing recreation and

24 open space.
25 149. Also, the Project was required to re-strip in order to add a westbound right turn
26 lane at State Street and Imperial Highway. This specific requirement conflicts and is inconsistent
27

32
28
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 with the requirement to implement the Bike Path provided in both the LTASP and the Bicycle

2 and Pedestrian Transportation Plan of the City's General Plan Circulation Element, which was

3 not considered in the SEIR.

4 150. This requirement will decrease the opportunity within the traffic lanes at Imperial

5 Highway and State Street for bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure. This condition of the Project

6 is in direct physical conflict with the many implementation standards including; to widen the
7 sidewalks, create bulb-outs, and create a designated striped bike lane along the curb consistent
8 with the standards of a Class II Bike lane, all of which are proscribed for State Street at the
9 intersection with Imperial Highway.
10
151. This conflict and inconsistency constitutes a significant land use impact that
11

12 without identification, analysis and mitigation, does not comply with CEQA.

152.
13 This condition also elevates automobile mobility over pedestrian and bicycle

14 mobility and is materially inconsistent with the repeatedly stated purpose of the LTASP, the

15 Respondent's Circulation of its General Plan, that it is the City's intention to give ". ..

16 preference to pedestrian and bicycle users. . ." over private automobile transportation (CC p 35)

17 Nothing about this conflict was mentioned in the SEIR.

18 153. Only by fully disclosing all of "inconsistencies" and/or "conflicts" between the

19 Project and the LTASP in light of this clearly spelled out duty is the Legislature's purpose and

20 intent for CEQA to achieve the maximum feasible protection of the environment attainable.

21 154. A material discrepancy between the record and the CEQA certification as it

22 applies to the SPR involves the specific amendment that allows the transfer of density from one

23 portion of the LTASP area to the Subject Property.

24 155. Everything in the LTASP revolves around the Metro Green Line. It is the focal
25 point of the LTASP.
26 156. The western-most portion of the entire 300+ acre LTASP geographic area has an
27
33
28
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 entirely different relationship with the Metro Green Line (distance and accessibility profile) than

2 does the eastern portion of the LTASP area. This fact is based on the industry standard embodied

3 throughout the SEIR that walking distance to the Metro Green Line is ½ mile.

4 157. The muttiple references in many forms to transit access made throughout the

5 LTASP is directly related to the Town Center District, defined as" the triangular-shaped

6 quadrant generally bounded by Imperial Highway/Long Beach Boulevard, State Street, and the

7 105." (CC41) The Town Center District envisions higher densities.

8
158. In one portion of the LTASP density is stated as: "[u]p to 100 dwelling units at
9 densities of approximately 20 dwelling units per acre. . ."(CC ) whereas in another portion, it
10
is stated as: 66 densities of approximately 60 dwelling units per acre. . ."(CC 52) this conflict
11
is not resolved in the LTASP.
12
159.
13 Within the defined area of the Town Center (see paragraph above), the ½ mile

14 industry standard for walking distance to the Metro Green Line would seem to apply regarding

15 those properties located within that distance. LTASP states: "The Town Center District will also

16 provide a connection to the adjacent Metro station."

17 160. Consistent with this ½/ industry standard for walkability to transit, the LTASP has

18 designated a 13-acre area, located west of State Street, it calls the West Town Center
I9  Neighborhood which clearly exceeds the ½ mtle industry standard for the walking distance
20 between that neighborhood and the Metro Green Line.

21 161. Regarding the density standards for the West Town Center Neighborhood, the
22 LTASP provides that:

23 The West Town Center neighborhood is envisioned as an extension of the

24 Town Center district, but the density will transition from vibrant, high-density
entertainment, retail and residential uses in the Town Center district (located to
25 the east of the West Town Center Neighborhood) to a mixture of low-to medium residential dwellings and recreational facilities parallel to Fernwod Avenue and
26 Imperial Highway. Future housing types will include duplex/triplex, townhouses,

27 courtyard housing, stacked flats, and live/work units.

34
28
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1

2 Nothing is stated in the description of the West Town Center neighborhood about "a

3 connection to the adjacent Metro station."

4 162. The West Town Center neighborhood is located the same distance from the Metro

5 Green Line as the Project - both are well beyond the ½ industry standard for walking distance to

6 the Metro Green Line station.

7 163. The use of the SEIR as the first consideration of the potential environmental

8 impacts of the SPR was the use of the wrong vehicle.
9
164. As a procedural matter, City cannot rely on Public Resources Code Section 21166
10 and CEQA Guidelines Sections 15162 and 15163 to review and consider the SPR, a project for
11

12 which there has been no previous environmental document approved by the City in connection

13 with the Project.

14 165. Under the correct circumstances, an SEIR may be an acceptable vehicle under

15 CEQA to analyze significant environmental effects of a project and identify possible ways to

16 minimize the significant effects for a modified project that has already been certified under

17 CEQA as having been fully analyzed and considered.

18 166. The SPR was never previously been certified under CEQA as having been fully
19 analyzed and considered. Therefore use of a supplemental EIR is not an appropriate vehicle to
20 analyze significant environmental effects of the SPR and identify possible ways to minimize the

21 significant effects for a modified project. The SPR simply does not meet the criteria under

22 CEQA for the proper use of supplemental EIR.

23 167. Moreover, the facts relevant to a CEQA analysis for a 300+ acre geographic a

24 district differ from the facts relevant to a CEQA analysis for a Site Plan Review for a 1,500
25 person apartment building.
26 168. For one important example highly relevant to the goals and policies of the
27
35
28 PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 LTASP, the transit opportunities for the Subject Property differ entirely from very generalized

2 statements about transit opportunities for the geographic area at large. Because the Subject

3 Property is not located within the well-established industry standard for walking distance to the

4 Metro Green Line Station, then the assumptions about reductions in VMT for the geographic
area cannot be extrapolated to the Project-level analysis.

6 169. Specifically the EIR for the 2016 LTASP assumes that for the geographic area,

7 "the project site has excellent transit opportunities, and the project design would enhance
8 pedestrian and bicycle connectivity as well as improve transit accessibility." But that assumption
9
iS not true for the Subject Property.
10
170. Moreover, EIR for the 2016 LTASP contains Table 39 that shows a nearly 40%
11

12 reduction in VMT based on proximity to transit, that does not apply to the Subject Property.

13 Overall, for the geographic area, Table 39 of the EIR for the 2016 LTASP shows a nearly 50%

14 reduction in total VMT. (page 202) And as discussed more fully below, the SPR will not involve

15 any enhancement of pedestrian and bicycle connectivity assumed in the EIR for the 2016

16 LTASP and other factors described in Table 39 do not apply.

17 171. CEQA requires a clear, accurate and comprehensible environmental analysis

18 regarding each potential environmental impact for each individual project.

19 172. CEQA requires that the analysis of the SPR must take into account its unique

20 characteristics including its size, location, density, and the fact that it is one of the City's first

21 large projects since the LTASP was first enacted in 2016.

22 173. There are many statements in the SEIR regarding the ease of walking that clearly

23 are false regarding the Subject Property which is well over ½ mile walking distance to the Metro

24 Green Line.

25 174. It is this material factual difference between the Town Center District in general
26 and the Subject Property in particular - involving the distance between and therefore
27

36
28
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 accessibility to the Metro Green Line that renders the overly general statements in the SEIR

2 regarding accessibility to transit untrue, or at least materially misleading.

3 175. Indeed, the SEIR is materially misleading with respect to the primary goal of
4 "promoting transit-oriented development near the Metro Green Line Station." Simply stated, the

5 use of SEIR as it may generally apply to the primary goal of "promoting transit-oriented

6 development near the Metro Green Line Station" with respect to much of the 300+ acre
7 geographic area, does not apply at all the to Subject Property
8
176. For purposes of CEQA compliance regarding the SPR (distinguished from the
Il amendment of the LTASP), the record does not support the repeatedly made statement in the 10
SEIR that the Project is located within walking distance to the Metro Green Line. 11
177.
12 The Amendment allows the transfer of density from a hypothetical location

13 located within the ½/ mile industry standard walking distance that allows for the assumption of

14 reasonable walking access to the Metro Green Line, to the Project that is located well outside of

15 that distance. (CC 52)

16 178. Neither the 2016 EIR for the LTASP nor the SEIR for the Amended LTASP

17 examined the potential detrimental impacts of the density transfer from a property located within

18 the accepted norms for walking distance to transit to one such as the Subject Property, the site of

19 the SPR, which clearly is not located within the standard for walkability.

20 179. As the SPR creates its own specific impacts separate and apart from those created

21 by the much broader project consisting of the amendment to the LTASP, each project defined in
22 CEQA must be adequately evaluated for its own environmental impacts. There has been no
23 examination of the environmental consequences of the transfer of increased density to the
24 Subject Property that is located well beyond the ½/ industry standard for walking distance to the
25 Metro Green Line station.
26 180. In its Response to Comments, City acknowledges this analytical deficiency under
27

37 28
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 CEQA by changing its argument regarding transit accessibility to Metro Bus Line Number 760

2 from the Metro Green Line. However, there is nothing stated in the record to support the

3 contention that Metro Bus Line Number 760 is within the ½ industry standard for walking

4 distance or more importantly, the implication that residents of the Project will use the Metro Bus

5 Line Number 760 as a meaningful alternative to automobile trips.

6 181. Indeed, nowhere in the EIR or the SEIR is there any mention the Metro bus 760
7
line.

182. At a minimum, this switch between the Metro Green Line and the Metro Bus Line
9
Number 760 to support the argument that the Project is located within the ½ industry standard
10
for walking distance constitutes "significant new information" requiring recirculation of the
11
SEIR as that term is defined under CEQA.
12
183.
13 The SEIR must contain objective data to show its ridership profile to: 1) confirm

14 it provides access on a 15-minute basis during peak hours (which the undersigned could not

15 confirm and challenges); and 2) to indicate its potential to support the many conclusions about

16 reduction in the use of the automobile by the intended residents of the Project.

17 184. The SEIR, as it relates to the Project (as opposed to the amendment of the

18 LTASP), fails to include any ridership details about the Metro Bus Line 760. Nor does it

19 demonstrate that it meets the criterion of service every 15-minutes during morning and evening

20 | rush hours necessary to qualify as a major transit alternative.

21 185. Therefore, the record does not support any of the analysis or conclusions based on

22 the assumption Project residents will utilize the Metro Bus Line 760 instead of personal

23 automobiles.

24 186. The statements regarding accessibility to the Metro Green Line made repeatedly

25 throughout the SEIR and in particular support of nearly every topical examination of the
26 potential for significant environmental impacts, are untrue as it relates to the Project at the
27

38
28
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 Subject Property. Therefore, this new information is both significant as defined in CFQA and

2 material and therefore the failure to re-circulate the SEIR in light of this material change as the

3 SEIR relates to the Project (as opposed to the amendment of the LTASP), constitutes a failure to

4 comply with CEQA.

5 187. Regarding the environmental issue involving potential exposure to hazardous

6 materials at the site of the Project, there is only one environmental mitigation measure related to
7 the site itself, as opposed to the entire geographic area comprising the LTASP.
8
188. However, the record establishes that the Subject Property for the Project is an
9
established hazardous waste site in the City confirmed by a recorded deed limiting all future
10
development for the purpose of minimizing exposure to harmful 11 gases under the ground at the

12 site. Petitioner submitted a copy of that land use restriction deed.

189.
13 One of the primary functions of CEQA is full disclosure. Despite these facts,

14 there was no mention of them in the SEIR. It is not sufficient compliance with CEQA to fail to

15 note these facts.

16 190. On or about June 25, 2018, City published notice of a Proposed Amendment to

17 the Lynwood Transit Area Specific Plan under Article 6 of Title 7 of 7 the Government Code. That

18 notice does not describe the Project in any part of it. That notice only describes the proposed
19 amendment to the LTASP. Therefore, the notice is legally inadequate.

20 191. For another example of flaws in the SEIR revealed in the Responses to

21 Comments, is the misplaced reliance on the "doctrine of consistency" under the Government

22 Code (Sierra Club v. County of Napa (2004) 121 Cal, App. 4th 1490), to support tiering. In other
23 words, City takes the erroneous position that if the Project is "consistent" with the previously
24 approved LTASP, then it can dispense with much of the required analysis otherwise. Tiering
25 does not excuse the duty of performing a full, accurate and complete analysis of the unique
26 environmental impacts of any project not previously considered in the earlier environmental
27

28 39

PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 analysis.

2 192. The Responses to Comments applies the wrong legal standard by its statement

3 that the Project is not inconsistent with the City's Complete Streets Policies and will not

4 preclude the City form implementing the recommended pedestrian and bicycle improvements

5 identified in the LTASP in the future." (Emphasis added.) See page 2-26 item A-5. The accepted
6 notion in the Response to Comments that the various pedestrian and bicycle improvements
7 throughout the specific plan arca will be implemented by the City "overtime as the specific plan
8
is implemented" amplifies the analysis and conclusion that these provisions of these many plans
9
do not apply to this Project.
10
193. By way of specific rebuttal, first, the Project is large and important project
11

12 within the LTASP area. The City cannot have it both ways - either the Project is implementing

13 the LTASP (which has been offered as justification for all of the purpose for the Amendments to

14 the LTASP and the Project), in which case the failure of City to adopt pedestrian and bicycle

15 related improvements as conditions of the Project does materially hinder their achievement,

16 particularly in the LTASP area; or the Project does not implement the LTASP in which case the

17 Project is not consistent with it which raises significant environmental issues involving Air

18 Quality, Greenhouse Gas, Traffic and Land Use impacts.

194. The SEIR establishes that open space and recreational opportunities within the

20 City are scarce and there is very little available land to add to the already significant deficit in the

21 ratio between the amount of parkland available to the residents of the City and the number of

22 residents of the City.

23 195. The facts unique to this Project consisting of the combined requests to: increase

24 density, decrease minimum unit size and decrease open space coupled with the Project's distance
25 from and lack of accessibility to useful parkland services plus the application of the City's
26 normal standards regarding the addition of new parkland for the increase in population that
27

28 40

PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 generates increased demand for Public Services - Parkland were never considered in the LTASP

2 EIR, the SEIR, or at all. The City cannot find that the SEIR is legally adequate for the Project

3 based on this environmental analysis.

4 196. The City has an extreme deficit in meeting its parkland goals.

5 197. It does not require a leap in the analysis to conclude that the many failures to
6 specifically require the full compliance with articulated open space provisions of the LTASP
7 adjacent to the Project while reducing the minimum standards for open space at the Project,
8 constitutes evidence of a potential environmental impact that was never properly considered.
9
198.
10 To the extent, the Project seeks to mitigate its impacts regarding Public Services -

11 Parkland by paying the in-lieu fee, there is no evidence in the record that payment of fees will

12 ever result in the acquisition of additional parkland as required under Mitigation Measure PS-1.

13 The Project generates demand for additional parkland with no reasonable assurance that it will be

14 met --4 ever. Indeed the record contains considerable substantial evidence that it will not be met.

15 The SEIR explains the reason as follows: ...[b]ecause the city is built out, albeit with some

16 vacant parcels, it is unknown where land for new or expanded parks would be . . ." This is

17 coupled with the admission that the City already has a deficit a in parkland of 118 acres.
18 Extrapolating from that figure, the City already lacks sufficient parkland for approximately

19 39,000 of its current residents.

20 199. This is not a correct or lawful statement about the duty owing by the Project to

21 mitigation in light of the City's requirement for design review and the specific requirements

22 regarding project implementation of the LTASP project by project.

23 200. Petitioners have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy at law other than the relief
24 sought in this petition, specifically an order to set aside the approval of the Real Party's SPR
25

26 under the provisions of the applicable land use provisions, i.e., the 2 specific plans, and other

27 applicable land use policies ordinances, and applicable state law; to openly, accurately and fairly
