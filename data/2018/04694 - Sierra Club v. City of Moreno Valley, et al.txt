22 TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA:
23 PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 21167.7, that on
24 October 18, 2018, Petitioner, SIERRA CLUB, filed a Verified Petition for Peremptory Writ of
25 Mandate pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) challenging the approval
26 by the CITY OF MORENO VALLEY of the Brodiaea Commerce Center Project, which proposes
27 the construction and operation of a 261,807-square foot industrial building on 12 acres of vacant
28 1

land in the City of Moreno Valley. To permit this use, the Project requires a zone change from
2 Business Park-Mixed Use (BP-X) to Light Industrial (LI).

3 The Project will operate as a high cube/warehouse distribution facility, meaning that diesel

4 trucks traveling from locations such as the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles will bring cargo

5 to the warehouse building for storage and sorting for transport on other trucks to destinations in and

6 outside California. These operations will occur 24 hours per day, seven days per week. Existing
7 single-family residences are located to the east of the Project site immediately across Heacock
Street. Trucks servicing the Project site will travel on Heacock Street adjacent to residences and

0 schools in route to State Route (SR) 60.

10 The Petition alleges that the County failed to comply with CEQA in certifying an

11 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the Project. Among other deficiencies, the EIR ignores

12 feasible mitigation for significant air quality impacts - namely measures that would address the

13 Project's harmful diesel emissions.

14 For the reasons alleged in the Verified Petition for Peremptory Writ of Mandate (transmitted

15 herewith), the decisions approving the Project and certifying the Project's EIR must be overturned.

0A00- INTRODUCTION

1. This action challenges the approval by Respondent, City of Moreno Valley ("City"),
on or about September 18, 2018, of the Brodiaea Commerce Center project,

6 including certification of a Final Environmental Impact Report, Change of Zone, and

7 all related land use approvals (collectively, "the Brodiaca Project" or "the Project").

8 The adverse and significant impacts associated with the Project have not been

9 properly evaluated and/or mitigated in violation of the California Environmental

10 2. Quality ("CEQA") (Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.).

11 The Brodiaea Project concerns the construction and operation of a 261,807-square

12 foot industrial building on 12 acres of vacant land in the City of Moreno Valley. To

13 permit this use, the Project requires a zone change from Business Park-Mixed Use

14 (BP-X) to Light Industrial (LI). The Project will operate as a high cube/warehouse

15 distribution facility, meaning that diesel trucks traveling from locations such as the

16 Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles will bring cargo to the warehouse building for

17 storage and sorting for transport on other trucks to destinations in and outside

18 California. These operations will occur 24 hours per day, seven days per week.

19 Existing single-family residences are located to the east of the Project site

20 immediately across Heacock Street. Trucks servicing the Project will travel on

21 Heacock Street adjacent to residences and schools in route to State Route (SR) 60.

22 3. The City of Moreno Valley's certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report

23 ("EIR") for the Project must be vacated because, among other reasons, the EIR fails

24 to adequately describe or disclose relevant information; the Project results in

25 significant and unavoidable air quality impacts but mitigation is ineffective to

26 reduce impacts; and the City improperly rejected feasible air quality mitigation

27 measures and project alternatives that would lessen some of the Project's harmful
environmental effects.

28

-2-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 4. During the administrative review process, the City was notified that there was need

2 for further analysis and mitigation due to the Project's adverse environmental

3 effects. In spite of these reasoned comments in the record, the City approved the
4 Project and certified the Final EIR.

5 5. By this verified petition, Petitioner, Sierra Club, alleges the following:

6 PARTIES

7 6. Petitioner, SIERRA CLUB, is a long-standing environmental organization whose

8 goals including protecting California's lands, waters, air and wildlife. The San
9 Gorgonio Chapter of the Sierra Club has membership of over 7,000 individuals with
10 approximately 3,900 members living in Riverside County. Local members of the
11 San Gorgonio Chapter of the Sierra Club reside in the general vicinity of the Project
12 site and are concerned with the Project's impacts to the local and regional
13 environment. Sierra Club submitted comments opposing approval of the Project to
14 the City.

15 7. Respondent, CITY OF MORENO VALLEY, is political subdivision of the State
16 of California. The City a is a local governmental agency charged with the authority of
17 regulating and administering local land use and development within its territory in
18 compliance with the provisions of its general plan and zoning ordinances as well as
19 applicable provisions of State law, including CEQA. The City is the lead agency
20 for the Project and is therefore charged with the duty of ensuring compliance with
21 applicable State and local laws.
22 8. Petitioner is informed and believes that Real Party in Interest, ALERE PROPERTY
23 GROUP LLC, was the applicant for the Project, has an ownership interest in the
24 property, and/or claims an interest in the Project approvals at the subject of this
25 lawsuit.

26 9. Petitioner is informed and believes that Real Party in Interest, OLINGER
27 RIVERSIDE LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, was the applicant for the Project, has an
28 ownership interest in the property, and/or claims an interest in the Project approvals
at the subject of this lawsuit.

-3-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

10. DOES 1 through 100 are individuals or entities that may have an ownership interest
2 in the property, were project applicants, or claim an interest in the approvals at the
3 subject of this lawsuit. Petitioner is unaware of the true names or capacities of the
4 Real Parties in Interest identified herein under the fictitious names DOES 1 through
5 100 inclusive.

6 STATEMENT OF FACTS

7 The Project

8 11. The Brodiaea Project is described as a proposal for the construction and operation
9 of an industrial high cube/warehouse building, totaling 261,807-square feet, on 12
10 vacant acres in the City of Moreno Valley.
11 12. The building will have a total of 33 truck docks or bays for the shipping and
12 receiving of goods, 33 truck parking spaces, and 138 automobile parking spaces.
13 The building will be approximately 43 feet tall.
14 13. The Project site is bounded by Heacock Street on the east, Alessandro Boulevard on
15 the north, and the Brodiaea Avenue to the south.

16 14. The area to the immediate east across Heacock Street is populated with single-
17 family homes in residential zones.
18 15. Vehicular access to the Project will be provided by two driveways connecting to
19 Brodiaca Avenue. The Project's EIR assumes that trucks servicing the Project will
20 utilize Heacock Street. Heacock Street between the Project site and State Route
21 (SR) 60 to the north is adjacent to three public schools: Sunnymead Middle School,
22 Sunnymead Elementary School, and Creekside Elementary.
23 16. The Project site is currently zoned Business Park-Mixed Use (BPX) with "Mixed-
24 Use Neighborhood (MUN) overlay and "Business Park (BP)" land uses. The
25 primary purpose of the BPX district is to provide locations for limited convenience
26 commercial and business support services. The MUN overlay district provides for
27 low-rise, mixed-use development that serves the needs of residents, visitors,
28

-4-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1

2 and employees from the surrounding immediate neighborhood. The purpose of the

3 BP district is to provide for light industrial, research and development, office-based

A firms and limited supportive commercial land uses.

5 17. The Project includes the certification of Final Environmental Impact Report
(PEN17-0145) and the following land use approvals:

6 a) Change of Zone PEN17-0144, and

7 b) Plot Plan PEN17-0143.

8 CEQA Review and Project Approval
9

10 18. The City circulated a Notice of Preparation (NOP) for the Project pursuant to
CEQA on or about November 13, 2017.

11

12 19. The Project's Draft EIR pursuant to CEQA was circulated for public comment on
May 18, 2018.
13

14 20. The Project's Final EIR was made available on or about August 9, 2018.

15 21. The Final EIR finds that the Project will result in significant and unavoidable

16 impacts in terms of air quality - i.e., the Project will exceed regional air quality

17 thresholds for NOx during Project operation.

18 22. On August 23, 2018, the City of Moreno Valley's Planning Commission held a

19 public hearing on the Project and voted to recommend that the City Council

20 certify the EIR and otherwise approve the Project.

21 23. On September 18, 2018, the City of Moreno Valley City Council held a public

22 hearing on the Project. At this meeting, the City Council voted to approve the
Project including certification of the Final EIR.

23

24 24. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the City posted the

25 Notice of Determination (NOD) pursuant to CEQA on or about September 19,
2018.

26

27 25. The City's approval of the Project will cause Petitioner irreparable injury

28

-5-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 for which Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law. Petitioner and its members will

2 be irreparably harmed by the City's actions in approving the Project. Petitioner was

3 harmed by, among other things, the failure of the City in its certification of the EIR

4 to adequately evaluate the potential impacts of the Project, and the City's approval

5 of the Project without providing adequate and effective mitigation measures

6 contrary to the requirements of State law.

7 26. The maintenance of this action is for the purpose of enforcing important public

8 policies of the State of California with respect to the protection of the environment
9 under CEQA and conformance with state law and local law. The maintenance and

10 prosecution of this action will confer a substantial benefit upon the public by
11 protecting the public from environmental and other harms alleged in this Petition.
12 Petitioner is acting a as a private attorney general to enforce these public policies and
13 prevent such harm.
14 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

15 27. This Court has jurisdiction to issue writs of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure
16 Section 1094.5.

17 28. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
18 Sections 393 and 394 as the Project is located in, and the relevant events occurred
19 in, Riverside County.

20 29. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing the action by complying
21 with the requirements of Public Resources Code § 21167.5, in notifying Respondent
22 of the filing of this action (attached hereto as Exhibit "A"), and by complying with
23 the requirements of Public Resources Code § 21167.6, in notifying Respondent of
24 Petitioner's election to prepare the record of Respondent proceedings in connection
25 with this action (attached hereto as Exhibit "B").

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

2 30. During the Project's administrative review process, Petitioner commented to the
City in writing that the Project would result in potentially significant impacts
to/from including, but not limited to: air quality, energy, greenhouse gases, land use,

5 traffic and other impacts. Petitioner commented that the EIR was legally

6 inadequate; that further mitigation was required; and that project alternatives were
7 feasible.

8 31. As a result of these comments in the record, Petitioner exhausted its administrative
9 remedies within the meaning of Cal. Public Resources Code § 21177.
10 CAUSE OF ACTION
11 (Writ of Mandate)
12 (All parties did not comply with the requirements of CEQA.)

13 32. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates paragraphs : through 31 above as
14 though set forth in full herein.
15 33. The California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") (Public Resources Code §
16 21100 et seq.), enacted in 1971, requires government agencies to consider the
17 environmental consequences of their actions before approving projects subject to
18 CEQA's provisions.
19 34. The Environmental Impact Report (*EIR") is considered "the heart" of CEQA. To
20 effectuate the Legislature's goals of environmental protection, CEQA provides that
21 an adequate EIR must evaluate all potentially significant environmental impacts of a
22 proposed project including both direct and indirect impacts as well as cumulative
23 impacts. (State CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15126, 15126.2 (a), 15130)
24 35. Petitioner and others commented that the EIR failed to adequately evaluate impacts
25 to/from including, but not limited to, air quality, energy, greenhouse gas emissions,
26 land use, and traffic.
27

28

-7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

a) For instance, Petitioner commented that the EIR's analysis of the Project's
N m t00D energy impacts is inadequate in terms of the requirements of State CEQA
Guidelines, Appendix F. The City failed to require sufficient analysis of the
Project's energy consumption, transportation energy impacts, and to
demonstrate that the Project is taking steps to reduce dependency on fossil
fuels. The City also failed to evaluate or demonstrate how the Project
"increases reliance on renewable energy sources." The Project is not
8 required to use any solar energy despite the Project having an estimated
9 energy demand of 1,012,413 kWh/year, and despite solar energy being a
10 demonstrably feasible measure to reduce the Project's energy consumption.
11 b) Again for instance, the EIR does not evaluate or demonstrate Project
12 consistency with the City's Energy Efficiency and Climate Action Strategy
13 ("Climate Action Strategy"). The EIR does not evaluate how the Project - a
14 new source of Greenhouse Gas Emissions ("GHGs") - assists the City to
15 meet its emission reduction targets consistent with the Climate Action
16 Strategy or Assembly Bill (AB) 32. The Project is purported to generate
17 6,430 MTCO2e per year which is a new source of GHG emissions.
18 Furthermore, the EIR does not discuss consistency with applicable "GHG
19 reduction measures" from the Climate Action Strategy, such as Measure C46
20 which states that the City shall "adopt and implement policy to increase the
21 use of renewable energy."
22 c) Also for instance, the EIR's conclusion of less than significant with respect
23 to land use impacts is not supported by substantial evidence. The Project
24 changes the applicable zoning from BP-X to LI. The EIR dubiously asserts

25 that the Project's significant NOx (diesel) emissions are not "directly
26 attributable" to the Project's proposed change of zone and that "similar" uses
27 would be allowed under existing zoning designations. According to the Staff
28

-8-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Report, the BP zone does not allow for warehouses larger than 50,000 square
2 feet. Thus, as a result of the zone change, there are increased air quality
cO impacts as a result of a greater number of diesel truck trips. This amounts to
a significant land use impact, and the zone change does not resolve this
inconsistency. Further, the EIR omitted any analysis of the Project's
6 conformance with the City's General Plan or its specific objectives and
7 policies including, but not limited to, Conservation Element Objective 7.5
and Policy 7.5.5 (encourage the use of solar power and other renewable
9 energy systems).
10 d) Finally for instance, the EIR fails to adequately evaluate and disclose the

to 11 cumulative impacts associated with trucks using Heacock Street for access
12 SR-60. The adverse effects of countless diesel trucks traveling by homes
13 and schools on Heacock Street have not been adequately disclosed or
14 evaluated.

15 36. CEQA establishes substantive mandate on the part of the lead agency to mitigate
16 the significant environmental impacts of a project. (Public Resources Code §
17 21002, 21002.1; State CEQA Guidelines, § 15021 (a).) A lead agency may not
18 approve a project for which there are significant environmental impacts unless the
19 agency makes findings that: (a) mitigation measures have been required of the
impacts, or 20 project which avoid or substantially lessen the significant environmental
21 (b) mitigation measures are found to be infeasible based on substantial evidence.
22 (Public Resources Code §§ 21081, 21081.5; State CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15091
23 (a)(b), 15092 (b).)
24 37. Petitioner and others commented that the City failed to adequately mitigate
25 significant Project impacts including the failure to adopt feasible mitigation.
26 a) For instance, the City failed to mitigate, by enforceable measures, the
27 potentially significant traffic impacts of the Project. The EIR assumes 20%
28

-9-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

of truck traffic will travel on Heacock Street near residences and schools.
Thus, the Project should, but does not, restrict truck traffic in the manner
assumed by the EIR to ensure that the scope of impact is consistent with the
EIR's analysis. In other words, there are no enforceable measures to ensure
that the traffic assumptions of the EIR are correct.

7 b) Also for instance, Petitioner and others proposed a number of feasible air

8 quality mitigation measures for significant NOx (diesel) impacts. Mobile
emissions account for approximately 92% of the Project's total operational

5:6 NOx emissions. The City did not adopt feasible measures to lessen these
impacts, it and it did not make findings supported by substantial evidence that
the measures were infeasible. These measures include, but are not limited to,

13 the phase-in of alternatively fueled or zero emission trucks; the periodic

14 feasibility review of alternatively fueled or zero emission trucks; or requiring

15 that only model year 2010 trucks or newer are permitted to access the Project

site.

16

17 38. CEQA provides that a lead agency must evaluate alternatives to the proposed

18 project, or the location of the project, which would attain most of the basic

19 objectives of the project but would avoid or substantially lessen any of the project's

20 significant environmental effects. (State CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.6 (a).) The

21 lead agency has a duty to adopt a project alternative if it is feasible. (Public

22 Resources Code § 21002) A lead agency may not reject an alternative unless the

agency

23 makes findings supported by substantial evidence showing that the

24 alternative is infeasible. (Public Resources Code, §§ 21081, 21081.5; State CEQA
Guidelines, §§ 15091 (a)(3), 15092.)

25

26 39. Petitioner commented that there are feasible alternatives available that would

27 minimize the Project's impacts particularly to the residential areas to the east.

28 These alternatives include the "No Project Alternative-Warehouse Option." This

-10-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 alternative would reduce significant air quality impacts and it would fully meet
2 Project Objectives F, G, and I, and at least partially satisfy Project Objectives B,
3 C, E. and H. The City did not adopt the alternative, and it failed to make findings
4 supported by substantial evidence that the alternative is infeasible.

5 40. For these reasons, the City's actions in certifying the EIR constitute an abuse of
6 discretion within the meaning of CEQA and the Project approvals must be set aside.
7 (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1085, 1094.5; Public Resources Code § 21168.)

8 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

9 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays the following relief on all causes of action:
10 a) For the Court's peremptory writ of mandate requiring Respondent, City of
11 Moreno Valley, to set aside its decision certifying the EIR for the Project.
12 b) For the Court's peremptory writ of mandate requiring Respondent, City of
13 Moreno Valley, to set aside all Project approvals.
14 c) For such other and further relief, including preliminary and permanent
15 injunctive relief, in the event that a Real Parties in Interest, or their agents or
16 instrumentalities, intend to commence construction on the site while this
17 lawsuit is pending.
18 d) For such other relief as may be just and proper.
19 e) For the costs of this suit, including attorney's fees, pursuant to Code of Civil
20 Procedure § 1021.5.
