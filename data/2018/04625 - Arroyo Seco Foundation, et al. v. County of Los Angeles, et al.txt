15 INTRODUCTION

16 1.

17 This suit challenges the November 7, 2017 decision of Respondents voiding and setting

18 aside portions of the Final Environmental Impact Report ("FEIR") that was certified by the Board for

19 the Devil's Gate Reservoir Sediment Removal and Management Project in the Cities of Irwindale and

20 Pasadena ("Project") on November 12, 2014; certifying the Recirculated Portions of the FEIR

21 ("RFEIR"); adopting revisions to the Project's previously adopted Mitigation Monitoring and

22 Reporting Program (*MMRP") for the Project; adopting revisions to the Project's previously adopted

23 Environmental Finding of Fact; adopting findings that the District's actions were within the scope of the

24 previously adopted Statement of Overriding Considerations; approving modifications to the Project

25 without conducting further CEQA review; delegating authority to the Chief Engineer of the District to

26 execute an agreement with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to provide financial

27 assurances for compensatory mitigation; authorizing the District to enter into a construction contract for

28 the clearing of the reservoir, excavation, transportation, and disposal of sediment and construction of
access roads and other improvements for the Project; authorizing the District to carry out the Project;

-2-

P

2 finding that it actions were within the scope of the previously certified Final Environmental Impact

3 Report ("FEIR") and RFEIR; and issuing a Notice of Determination ("NOD") in violation of the

4 California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code ("PRC"), §§ 21000, et seq., and the

5 CEQA Guidelines, 14 California Code of Regulations ("CCR"), §§ 15000, et seq. ("CEQA").

2.

6 The Project, as approved on November 7, 2017, involves the excavation and removal of

7 1.7 million cubic yards ("mcy") of sediment from behind the Devil's Gate Dam and Reservoir ("Devil's

8 Gate Dam" or "Reservoir"), a 115-foot concrete flood control dam and adjoining reservoir built by the

9 District in 1920 to provide flood protection and water conservation for the cities of Pasadena, South
Pasadena, and Los Angeles.

10 3.

11 The Project proposes to remove sediment that has accumulated in the Reservoir in the

12 past several years, including sediment that accumulated following the 2009 Station Fire, a forest fire that

13 burned approximately 160,000 acres of the Angeles National Forest in the nearby San Gabriel

14 Mountains. In addition to removing accumulated sediment, the Project will establish a reservoir pool at
the face of the Dam, create a new reservoir configuration designed to store accumulated storm water and
15 groundwater recharge, and establish 50-acre permanent maintenance area.

16 4.

17 The Project's excavation and construction activities will take place for 9 months a year,

18 over a 4 to 5-year period, and will require the use of up to 425 on-road sediment removal dump truck
trips per day during that time.

19 5. The Project site is located within Hahamongna Watershed Park ("Park"), a popular City
20 of Pasadena park with 330 acres of open space that creates a transitional area between the City's urban

21

22 land uses, neighboring foothill communities, and the Angeles National Forest. Project-related activities

23 will permanently destroy over 60 acres of sensitive riparian habitat within the Park. Overall, the Project

24 footprint will occupy approximately 76 acres of the 330-acre Park.

6.

25 The District originally proposed and approved a 2.4 mcy version of the Project in 2014,
in reliance on its original 2014 FEIR.

26 7.

27 The 2014 FEIR concluded that the habitat loss caused by the Project would have

28 significant impacts on sensitive wildlife and plant species, but that those impacts would be reduced to
less than significant levels with the incorporation of the FEIR's eight biological mitigation measures,

-3-
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- Mitigation Measures Biology through 8.

2 8.

3 The original FEIR also concluded that the Project would generate significant air pollutant

4 emissions from nitrogen oxides ("NOx") from the use of on-road dump trucks. The FEIR concluded

5 that NOx emissions would exceed applicable thresholds of significance set forth by the South Coast Air

6 Quality Management District ("SCAQMD"), resulting in a significant air quality impact. The FEIR

7 incorporated a mitigation measure, Mitigation Measure Air 1, which purported to require use of

8 sediment removal dump trucks that meet EPA's emission standards for Model Year 2007. The FEIR

9 concluded that the Project's NOx emissions would be reduced to less than significant levels with
implementation of Mitigation Measure Air 1.

10 9.

11 Petitioners challenged the District's original 2014 Project approvals in the related lawsuit

12 of Arroyo Seco Foundation et al. V. County of Los Angeles et al., LASC Case Number BS152771 (case
filed December 11, 2014) ("ASF P').

13 10.

14 On April 19, 2017, this Court issued its judgment in ASF I ("Judgment"), which found

15 that Mitigation Measures Biology 6, 7, 8 and 8 failed to comply with CEQA because they failed to

16 provide substantial evidence supporting the FEIR's conclusion that a 1:1 mitigation ratio would reduce

17 the impacts to less than significant levels. The Judgment also found that Mitigation Measure Air

18 failed to include enforceable terms to ensure that NOx emissions would be reduced to less than

19 significant levels. The Court issued a Writ of Mandate ("Writ") on May 17, 2017, commanding the
District to rectify its CEQA violations.

20 11.

21 The District prepared a Revised Draft Environmental Impact Report ("RDEIR") in

22 response to the Writ, and released it for public comment in July 2017. Petitioners submitted extensive

23 written comments in response to the RDEIR, including expert comments, documenting significant

24 deficiencies in the RDEIR's analysis and mitigation of the Project's potentially significant impacts.

12.

25 The District released a Revised FEIR (RFEIR") in October 2017. Both the RDEIR and

26 RFEIR continued to analyze the originally approved 2.4 mcy Project, and contained only a narrow set of

27 revisions which addressed three issues: (1) providing evidentiary support for the 1:1 biological

28 mitigation ratios proposed in Mitigation Measures Biology 6, 7, and 8; (2) applying the Project's
biological mitigation measures to another cumulative Project identified in the FEIR; and (3) revising

-4-
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

P

2 Mitigation Measure Air 1 to state that the Project would use "Model Year 2010" dump trucks, rather
than "Model Year 2007" dump trucks as originally approved.

3 13.

4 The RFEIR also added new terms to Mitigation Measures Biology 6, 7, and 8 that 8

5 required deferred development of a Habitat Restoration Plan and future development of adaptive

6 management measures which the RFEIR assumed, without conducting a site-specific analysis of

7 biological impacts, would result in successful mitigation of impacts to sensitive riparian habitat and
sensitive species.

8 14.

9 On November 7, 2017, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, sitting as the

10 District's Board of Supervisors ("Board") conducted a public hearing on the Project and the RFEIR.

11 The Agenda and Staff Report for the hearing advised the public that the District would consider

12 certifying the RFEIR and issuing related approvals for the original Project (2.4 mcy).

15.

13 Petitioners submitted written comments prior to the hearing in response to the Agenda
and Staff Report.

14 16.

15 At the hearing, Supervisor Kathryn Barger presented a motion ("Barger Motion") to
reduce the Project's size to 1.7 mcy, while maintaining the same Project footprint as the original Project
16 ("Reduced-Size Project").

17 17.

18 Petitioners and other members of the public were limited to 3-minute oral comments at

19 the Board hearing. Petitioners members and others responded to the Barger Motion during their 3-

20 minute presentations by testifying that the Reduced-Size Project would have significant, unmitigated

21 impacts because it did nothing to reduce the Project's footprint or reduce air pollution or traffic from

22 Project haul trucks. Petitioners and other members of the public, including the Mayor of Pasadena,

23 reiterated their previously stated objections to the RFEIR in response to the Barger Motion.

18.

24 19. At the close of the hearing, the District voted to approve the Reduced-Size Project.

25 The District's approval of the Reduced-Size Project constituted a substantial change in

26 the Project that significantly altered the Project description. The RFEIR failed to analyze this revised

27 version of the Project, and failed to consider whether the Reduced-Size Project offered new or additional

28 mitigation measures or alternatives which would further reduce the Project's significant impacts.

20. The RFEIR also failed to analyze any new and changed circumstances surrounding the

-5-
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

P

2 Project that had occurred since its original 2014 approval, including, for example, the District's

3 subsequent recognition that the 2.4 mcy of sediment removal that was originally approved for the

4 Project, and its related impacts, "may be unnecessary." See 11/7/2017 Board of Supervisor's Hearing
Transcript, p 149, comments of Supervisor Barger.

5 21.

6 By omitting any analysis of the Reduced-Size Project, the RFEIR also failed to address

7 new information which has become available since the original 2014 FEIR certification. For example,

8 the RFEIR failed to consider new information demonstrating that the Project, as originally approved,

9 will result in significant air quality emissions and public health effects that vastly exceed the impacts
identified in the 2014 FEIR.

10 22.

11 Petitioners presented substantial evidence to the District identifying several recent air

12 quality studies which demonstrate that NOx emissions from Model Year 2010 haul trucks, which are

13 planned to be used for the Project, are 5 to 18 times greater than the District originally analyzed when it

certified the FEIR in 2014.

14 23. Petitioners also submitted substantial evidence from its air quality modeling experts
15 demonstrating that diesel emissions from the Project's proposed use of Model Year 2010 haul trucks

16

17 will result in a substantial cancer risk of 23.4 in one million, more than double the South Coast Air

18 Quality Management District's ("SCAQMD") significance threshold of 10 in one million. The RFEIR

19 failed to disclose this as a significant air quality impact. The RFEIR also failed to analyze whether the

20 Reduced-Size Project, which proposes to retain the same number of haul trucks as the original Project,

21 would result in a significant health impact from diesel emissions, and whether mitigation measures or

22 truck trip reductions were available to reduce significant air quality and health impacts posed by the
trucks to less than significant levels.

23 24.

24 As a result of these deficiencies, the RFEIR failed to adequately disclose and mitigate the

25 Project's new and potentially significant impacts on biological resources, including endangered and

26 special-status bird and plant species, and the Project's significant, unmitigated air quality impacts, which

27 far exceeded the emissions that were originally analyzed and mitigated in the FEIR.

25.

28 Petitioners and other members of the public submitted extensive public comments on the
RFEIR, supported by technical comments from highly qualified biological and air quality consultants.

-6-
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

P

2 Public comments identified these and other deficiencies in the RFEIR's impact analysis and mitigation
measures, and asked the District to recirculate the RFEIR.

3 26.

4 The District failed to make any modifications to the RFEIR in response to Petitioners'

5 comments or the comments of other members of the public, and failed to require the District to
recirculate the RFEIR to analyze the Reduced-Size Project.

6 27.

7 The Board voted to approve the Reduced-Size Project, certify the RFEIR with no

8 revisions, adopt the CEQA Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations that were

9 prepared for the original Project as part of the RFEIR, and issue related Project approvals at its
November 7, 2017 hearing.

10 28.

11 At the hearing, and without agendizing the item, Supervisor Kathryn Barger made the

12 Barger Motion for the Board to consider the Reduced-Size Project. The Barger Motion proposed that

13 the Board adopt the smaller Project, which would reduce the total volume of sediment removal for the

14 Project by 1/3 (700,000 mcy), but which failed to modify any other aspects of the original Project,

15 including failing to reduce the Project's original footprint or the number of haul trucks proposed for
sediment removal.

16 29.

17 In response to the Barger Motion, Petitioners and other members of the public raised

18 verbal concerns during oral public comments about the need for further CEQA review to consider the

19 substantial changes proposed by the Reduced-Size Project, including whether the Reduced-Size Project

20 would allow for a reduced Project footprint that would reduce the Project's significant impacts from

21 habitat removal, and whether the Reduced-Size Project could reduce significant air pollution and traffic

22 generated by the haul trucks that would be used during the Project's sediment removal phase.

30.

23 The Board failed to require any revisions to the RFEIR prior to approving the Reduced-

24 Size Project, and approved the Reduced-Size 1.7 mcy Project in reliance on the existing RFEIR.

31.

25 Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion and failed to proceed in the manner

26 required by law in modifying the Project and certifying a legally deficient RFEIR that failed to analyze

27 and adequately mitigate the Reduced-Size Project's impacts and changed circumstances surrounding its
approval.

28 32. Respondents also abused their discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by

-7-
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

P

2 law by failing to consider new information which demonstrated that the Project would have new and
more severe impacts that previously analyzed.

3 33.

4 Finally, Respondents abused their discretion or proceeded in a manner inconsistent with

5 law in adopting unsupported findings that the majority of the Project's significant impacts - including

6 biological and air quality impacts - would be reduced to less than significant levels with the original

7 Project's existing mitigation, that remaining impacts were acceptable due to overriding considerations,

8 and in determining that the MMRP was adequate, when it fails to mitigate all of the Reduced-Size

9 Project's potentially significant impacts to the greatest extent feasible.

34.

10 Because the manner in which Respondents reviewed and approved the RFEIR and

11 Project violated CEQA, the certification and Project approvals must be set aside.

17 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

Project History

18 42.

19 The Project site is located in Pasadena, California in Los Angeles County. The cities of

20 La Cañada Flintridge and Altadena border the Project site. The Project site is administrated by the

21 Flood Control District pursuant to an easement granted for flood control purposes by the City of
Pasadena to the Flood Control District in 1919 and 1965.

22 43.

23 The Dam, built in 1920 by the Flood Control District, is located in Pasadena, California

24 in Los Angeles County. The Dam, the very first flood control dam built in Los Angeles County, controls

25 flow from the Arroyo Seco, a 24.9-mile-long seasonal river that captures rainfall and storm water.

44.

26 Behind the Dam lies the Hahamongna Reservoir, a flood basin that after completion of

27 the Dam in 1920 had an original carrying capacity of approximately 7.4 million cy. Since then, the

28 Flood Control District has allowed sediment to regularly build up within the Reservoir, allowing overall
capacity to fluctuate between 3.4 to 4.9 million cy, a with a historical average of approximately 4.3

-9-
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- million cy.

2 45.

3 The Project site is located within Hahamongna Watershed Park, a popular and important

4 park used for both recreational activities and biological resources. The Park is owned by the City of

5 Pasadena. The Park encompasses 330 acres of open space, and creates a transitional area between the

6 City's urban land uses, neighboring foothill communities, and the Angeles National Forest. Portions of
the Park are located behind the Dam. Over the

7 areas of built-up sediment behind the Dam. years, critical parklands have become established on

8 46.

9 Due to its location at the foot of the San Gabriel Mountains, Hahamongna Watershed

10 Park is a rare and unique environmental resource which provides key habitat for wildlife, more than 206

11 species of birds, at least 14 amphibian and reptile species, and 12 mammal species, including numerous

12 threatened special status plant and animal species such as the Yellow Warbler, coast range newt, Coast

13 Patch-nosed Snake, and the federally-endangered Least Bell's Vireo.

47.

14 In 1998, the Flood Control District made improvements to the Dam, increasing the

15 Dam's capacity to efficiently pass water flows by allowing for earlier releases from the Reservoir during

16 stormwater events ("1998 Improvements"). The 1998 improvements installed a larger spillway on the

17 Dam to automatically allow for an early release of water after the Reservoir's water level reaching

18 1040.5 feet above sea level. The 1998 Improvements still maintains the original holding level of the

19 Dam, holding water until it reaches an elevation of 1065 feet above sea level.

48.

20 Sediment buildup in the Reservoir has varied widely over the years, ranging from

21 100,000 cy between 1992 to 1993 to 560,000 cy per year between the years of 1935 to 1938.

49.

22 Over the years, Flood Control District has conducted at least 25 sediment removal

23 operations, utilizing a mix of excavation, as is proposed for this Project, as well as sluicing, ranging in

24 size from as small as 200,000 cy in 2009, via excavation, to 1.08 million cy in 1942, primarily via
sluicing.

25 50.

26 At present, the Flood Control District is conducting interim sediment removal efforts,
removing approximately 25,000 cubic yards of sediment

27 per year from the Reservoir.

51.

28 The impetus for the Project came after the August 26, 2009 Station Fire. The fire, started
by an arsonist in the Angeles National Forest, burned nearly 252 square miles, including approximately

-10-
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

P 75% of the Reservoir's surround watershed.

2 52.

3 The 2009 Station Fire and two large rainy seasons in the two years after the Station Fire

4 caused approximately 1.1 million cy of sediment to flow into the Reservoir, lowering the capacity of the

Reservoir.

5 53.

6 As originally approved in 2014, the Project proposed to remove 2.4 mcy of sediment

7 from the Reservoir and establish a reservoir management system to maintain flood control capacity at
the Reservoir in two phases.

8 54.

9 As approved by the Board in November 2017, the Reduced-Size Project will remove 1.7
mcy of sediment from the Reservoir.

10 55.

11 As originally approved, the Project would permanently destroy over 60 acres of sensitive

12 riparian habitat within the Park to create a permanent maintenance area for the Project, including 1.1

13 acres of rare Riversidean Alluvial Fan Sage Scrub, 51.4 acres of Riparian Woodland and 11.1 acres of

Mule Fat Thickets.

14 56.

15 As originally approved, the Project would utilize approximately 425 haul trucks per day
during the Project's sediment removal phase.

16 57.

17 In approving the Reduced-Size Project, the Board failed to modify or reduce either the

18 Project's footprint or the number of haul trucks that would be required during the sediment removal

19 phase in any way, despite 1/3 reduction in the overall size of the Project.

58.

20 The Project is partially funded by a grant from the State of California created by the
Disaster Preparedness and Flood Protection Bond Act of 2006 (Proposition 1E).
21 Procedural Background and Changes to Project

22 59.

23 A Notice of Preparation and Initial Study for the Project ("NOP") was released on

24 September 28, 2011. A 45-day comment period was held and multiple public hearings were held.

60.

25 A Draft Environmental Impact Report ("DEIR") was released for the Project on October
23, 2013. The DEIR was held

26 open for public comment for 75 days from October 23, 2013 till January

27 6, 2014, where subsequently the review period was extended for an additional 90 days until January 21,

28 2014. Three public meetings were held on November 6, 14, and 16, 2013.

61. A FEIR was released on October 20, 2014.

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

H 62.

2 The DEIR and FEIR reviewed six alternatives. Alternative 1 Configuration B proposed to

3 remove approximately 2.8 million cy of sediment via excavation. Alternative 2 Configuration C

4 proposed to remove 4 million cy of sediment via excavation. Alternative 3 Configuration D, the

5 environmentally preferred alternative, proposes to remove approximately 2.4 million cy of sediment via

6 excavation. Alternative 4 proposes to remove approximately 2.9 million cy of sediment via sluicing.

7 Alternative 5 proposes to remove approximately 2.9 million cy of sediment via excavation using an

8 alternative haul route. Finally, the DEIR and FEIR also considered a No Project alternative.

63.

9 On November 12, 2014, the Board, sitting as the Governing Board of the Flood Control

10 District, certified the FEIR, adopted findings and a Statement of Overriding Considerations, and

11 approved the Project, adopting Alternative 3 Configuration D, which would have removed 2.4 million
cy of sediment via excavation.

12 64.

13 On December 11, 2014, Petitioners filed a lawsuit challenging the Flood Control

14 District's November 12, 2014 approval of the Project, ASF I.

65.

15 On February 14 and March 23, 2017, the Court conducted hearings on the case, issued

16 tentative decision and adopted a final decision granting Petitioners' Petition for Writ of Mandate in part,

17 finding that the Project's FEIR was deficient as to Mitigation Measure Air Quality 1, Mitigation

18 Measures Biological Resources 6, 7, and 8, and the FEIR's cumulative impacts analysis.

66.

19 The Court's February 14, 2017 tentative decision, which was ultimately adopted as
modified by the Reporter's Transcripts, found that the FEIR's analysis of the Project's impacts to
20 biological resources, as well as on air quality, were insufficient as the FEIR failed to provide substantial

21

22 evidence to support the FEIR's conclusion that a 1:1 habitat mitigation ratios adopted in Mitigation

23 Measures Biological Resources 6, 7, and 8 would mitigate the Project's impacts to biological resources

24 to less than significant levels. The Court also found that the FEIR failed to include enforceable terms in

25 Mitigation Measure Air Quality to ensure that the Project's significant NOx emissions would be
reduced to less than significant levels.

26 67.

27 The Court's March 23, 2017 tentative decision, which was ultimately adopted as

28 modified by the Reporter's Transcripts, found that the FEIR's analysis of cumulative impacts was
insufficient as the FEIR failed to state how cumulative impacts to biological resources such as special

-12-

P

2 status species, riparian habitat and other sensitive natural communities would be mitigated.

68.

3 On April 19 and May 17, 2017, the Court issued a judgment and writ of mandate ordering

4 the Flood Control District to 1) void and set aside the November 12, 2014 certification of the portions of

5 the FEIR for the Project, 2) take action to remedy the deficiencies identified in the Court's final

6 decision, 3) revise and re recirculate all necessary portions of the Final Environmental Impact and

7 Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program for a 45-day public a comment period, 4) place the

8 recirculated portions of the Final EIR and any amended portion of the Mitigation Monitoring and

9 Reporting Program on the publicly noticed agenda of the Board of Supervisors for hearing and public

10 comment, 5) Suspend any and all Project activities unless and until Respondents have taken the

11 necessary corrective actions to comply with CEQA, 6) ensure that the entire EIR has been completed in

12 compliance with CEQA and the CEQA and 7) comply with the provisions of CEQA and the CEQA
Guidelines in all other respects.

13 69.

14 On or about July 24, 2017, the County released RFEIR to the public for 45-day public

15 comment period expiring on September 7, 2017, and issuing a Notice of Availability / Notice of
Completion to the State's Office of Planning & Research.

71.

8 Identically to the FEIR, the RFEIR concluded that the Project would result in significant

9 impacts to riparian habitats and sensitive habitats from permanent habitat loss and alteration caused by

10 Project activities. The RFEIR included eight mitigation measures to address significant biological

impacts.

11 72.

12 The RFEIR modified previously approved Mitigation Measures Biology 6 and 8, which

13 proposed to mitigate the significant impacts from the Project's removal of alluvial fan sage scrub,

14 riparian habitat and other sensitive natural communities at a 1:1 ratio. In particular, Mitigation

15 Measures Biology 6 and 8 were 8 modified to require the development of performance standards for

16 mitigation sites, post-approval preparation of a site-specific Habitat Restoration Plan, and to require the

17 implementation of adaptive management measures, such as corrective re-grading, soil amendments,

18 replanting, trail closures, and/or barrier installation at mitigation sites if mitigation sites are

unsuccessful.

19 73.

20 The RFEIR concluded that, with implementation of modified Mitigation Measures

21 Biology 6, 7, and 8, the Project's impacts on riparian habitats and sensitive habitats would be less than

significant.

22 74.

23 The RFEIR failed to describe or analyze the Reduced-Size Project. In particular, the

24 RFEIR failed to analyze the Reduce-Size Project's impacts on biological resources, and failed to discuss
whether any additional or revised mitigation measures, or new alternatives, were available under the
25 Reduced-Size Project to further reduce the Project's significant biological impacts beyond the revised

26

27 measures identified in Mitigation Measures Biology 6, 7, and 8. For example, the RFEIR failed to

28 analyze whether adoption of the Reduced-Size Project would facilitate a decrease in the Project's
footprint, or an increase in on-site mitigation, which the RFEIR explained is the preferred mitigation

-14-
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 scenario.

2 75. Identically to the FEIR, the RFEIR concluded that the Project would result in significant

3 air pollutant emissions from NOx from the use of on-road sediment removal dump trucks. Specifically,

4 the RFEIR concluded that the Project's 425 haul trucks per day would generate significant NOx

5 emissions of 328 lbs/day, which vastly exceeds the SCAQMD's significance threshold of 100 lbs/day,

6 thereby resulting in a significant impact.

7 76. The RFEIR relied on the use of trucks that meet EPA's 2007 emissions standards to

8 reduce NOx emissions to less than significant levels. The RFEIR concluded that, with implementation

9 of the revised Mitigation Measure Air Quality 1, the Project's air quality impacts from NOx emissions

10 would be less than significant.

11 77. The RFEIR also concluded that the Project's traffic impacts resulting from its use of 425

12 truck trips per day would be significant and unavoidable.

13 78. However, the RFEIR failed to analyze the Reduced-Size Project's air pollutant emissions

14 or truck trips, and failed to describe all feasible mitigation measures that could be applied to the

15 Reduced-Size Project to reduce the Project's significant impacts in these areas. In particular, the RFEIR

16 failed to discuss whether the Reduced-Size Project was capable of using less haul trucks to haul the

17 reduced sediment volume, and whether the Reduced-Size Project's could implement additional or

18 revised mitigation measures, or new alternatives, to further reduce the Project's significant air quality

19 and traffic impacts caused by Project haul trucks.
20 79. On or about September 8, 2017, the Flood Control District extended the public comment

21 for the RDEIR for an additional 10 days until September 17, 2017.

22 80. The Flood Control District received comments from over 100 members of the public

23 regarding the RDEIR. Because the Reduced-Size Project was not described in the RDEIR, neither

24 Petitioners nor any other members of the public commented on the Reduced-Size Project in their RDEIR

25 comments.

26 81. On or about October 26, 2017, the Flood Control District released its Responses to

27 Comment for Recirculated Portions of the Final Environmental Impact Report and Mitigation

28 Monitoring and Reporting Program (*Response to Comments"), responding to the various public

-15-
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

P

2 comments received during the public comment period on the RDEIR.

82.

3 The Response to Comments failed to adequately address the issues raised by Petitioners

4 and other members of the public. In particular, the Responses failed to make any alterations to the

5 Project or modifications to its mitigation measures to address the unmitigated impacts identified by

6 Petitioners and other members of the public. The Responses to Comments also did not identify,
describe, or discuss the Reduced-Size Project.

7 83.

8 On November 7, 2017 the Board, sitting as the Governing Board of the Flood Control
District, conducted a public hearing on the RFEIR.

9 84.

10 The Agenda for the November 7, 2017 hearing identified the Project as Agenda Item No,

11 22, and stated that the Board would take the following actions:

a.

12 "Void and set aside those prior portions of the Final Environmental Impact Report

3 The Staff Report for the November 7, 2017 hearing described the Project that the Board

4 would consider at the hearing as the "Approved Project,' which the Staff Report explained "will remove

5 vegetation and 2.4 MCY of sediment from 69 acres within the reservoir over a period of 3 to 5 years."
11/7/2017 Staff Report, p. 4.

7 The Staff Report described the actions being considered by the Board as follows:

a.

8 "This action is to void and set aside those prior portions of the Final Environmental

9 Impact Report for the Devil's Gate Dam and Reservoir Sediment Removal Project

10 (Approved Project) in the Cities of Irwindale and Pasadena, certified by the Board on

Report, pp. 1-2.

3 88.

4 The Staff Report did not identify the Reduced-Size Project or explain that it would be
considered by the Board.

5 89.

6 At the November 7, 2017 Board hearing, Staff's presentation described the proposed

7 actions on the Project as the same actions identified in the Agenda and Staff Report. 11/7/2017 Board of

8 Supervisors Hearing Transcript, pp. 138-142. Staff's presentation did not discuss the Reduced-Size
Project.

9 90.

10 Following Staff's presentation, Supervisor Barger introduced the Barger Motion. The

11 Barger Motion proposed, inter alia, to "[r]educe the maximum total volume of sediment removed during

12 the Project by 700,000 cubic yards, while maintaining the proposed footprint, so that instead of

13 removing a maximum of 2.4 million cubic yards, plus any additional inflows during the Project, a

14 maximum of 1.7 million cubic yards, plus any additional inflows during the Project, will be removed,

15 and authorize the Director of Public Works, acting as the Chief Engineer of the Los Angeles County

16 Flood Control District or his designee to make any necessary modifications to the Board adopted plans

17 and specifications to accomplish this reduction in Project scope." See Barger Motion, 11/7/2017 Board
of Supervisors Hearing Transcript, pp. 147-151.

18 91.

19 During her presentation of the Barger Motion, Supervisor Barger also presented a

20 technical memorandum dated November 7, 2017 (the same date as the hearing) that had been prepared

21 by the District's environmental consultant ("ECORP Memorandum").

92.

22 The 9-page ECORP Memorandum contained a brief discussion the Reduced-Size Project,

23 stating that "the County is investigating a modified version of the Approved Project that would not

24 change the footprint but would reduce the volume of sediment removal from 2.4 mcy to 1.7 mcy."

25 ECORP Memorandum, p. 1. The ECORP Memorandum failed to address whether the reduction in
sediment could accommodate a smaller footprint in order to reduce biological impacts. The

26  memorandum also did not address whether the reduction in sediment removal could result in

27

28 correspondence reductions in the number, timing, or type of haul trucks required for the sediment
removal operations.

-19-
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

93. The ECORP Memorandum was not provided to the public prior to the Board hearing. It

2 was not included in the RFEIR, was not identified in the Agenda for the November 7, 2017 hearing, was

3 not included in the Staff Report that was made available to the public on the County's website, and was

4 not circulated for public comment.

5 94. Petitioners were not able to obtain a copy of the ECORP Memorandum until after the

6 close of the November 7, 2017 public hearing.

7 95. Petitioners submitted written comments prior to the commencement of the November 7,

8 2017 hearing, which identified numerous deficiencies in the RFEIR. Petitioners' comments asked the

9 District to recirculate the RFEIR to correct these deficiencies prior to considering re-approval of the

10 Project.

11 96. Oral public comments followed presentation of the Barger Motion, and were restricted to

12 3 minutes per person.

13 97. Petitioners and other members of the public testified at the hearing, addressing the Barger

14 Motion in addition to the RFEIR:

15 a. Petitioner Audubon member Kym Buzdygon testified that State and Federally listed

16 endangered species, including the Least Bell's vireo, utilize the Project site for habitat

17 and nesting. Ms. Buzdygon explained that these species "are not going to stay if we

18 destroy the best habitat in that park...If you bulldoze the habitat and continue to scrape it

19 bare every year, the vireos are not coming back, and neither are lot of other birds and

20 wildlife to this area." Ms. Buzdygon acknowledged the size reduction proposed by

21 Barger Motion, but implored the District that "in addition to the reduction in volume, 1

22 would also urge you to consider a reduction in the footprint." See 11/7/2017 Board of
23 Supervisors Hearing Transcript, pp. 172-173.

24 b. Mayor of Pasadena Terry Tornek, on behalf of the City of Pasadena, requested that the

25 amount of excavated sediment be reduced from 2.4 million cubic yards to 1.1 million,

26 and that the Project footprint, which he described as "shaped kind of like a guitar," be

27 reduced to a shape that was "more like a banjo," and that the area to the west of the

28 stream "might be handled somewhat differently." Mayor Tornek acknowledged that the

P

2 Barger Motion made steps towards satisfying the City's requests, but still fell short of the

W footprint reduction the City felt was necessary to reduce Project impacts. See 11/7/2017

† 4o Board of Supervisors Hearing Transcript, pp. 152-153; Pasadena RDEIR comments.
C. Other Petitioner representatives and members of the public commented that:
i. Petitioner Audubon member Carolyn Murphy: "Pasadena Audubon Society,

7 despite everything that's been said here this morning, continues to oppose the

8 current plan... we propose what the City of Pasadena originally wanted, and that's

9 the purpose of their plan is to just go slow, do less, and don't harm the habitats

10 and the environment as this current program does." See 11/7/2017 Board of

11 Supervisors Hearing Transcript, p. 161, comments of.

ii.

12 Petitioners' counsel: "We applaud Kathryn Barger's amendments. We believe

13 that's a step in the right direction but still reiterate my client's objections to the

14 project." See 11/7/2017 Board of Supervisors Hearing Transcript, p. 170.

15 iii. Tim Brick, Managing Director of Petitioner Arroyo Seco Foundation: "Supervisor

16 Barger's amendments move in the right direction, but we're still very concerned

17 about the inadequacies, the severe inadequacies of the mitigation program. And

18 we don't find this project one bit resilient. You've taken policy positions for

19 resilience. This Project is exactly the opposite of resilience. And I urge you really

20 to look into that because you need to do more...' See 11/7/2017 Board of

21 Supervisors Hearing Transcript, pp. 170-171.

22 iv. Mr. Brick attempted to continue testifying about the Barger Motion, but his
testimony was cut off by the Board:

23

24 1. Supervisor Ridley-Thomas, Chair: "Sir, may ] suggest that your time has
expired?"

25

26 2. Tim Brick: "You need to do more than take policy positions -"

27 3. Supervisor Ridley-Thomas, Chair: "All right. Thank you for your time.

28 Thank you very much. Next speaker, please. Next speaker, please?"

V. Sierra Club member Don Bremner: "The City of Pasadena's plan would remove

-21-
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- 1.1 million cubic yards, as the Mayor stated, to raise the basin's capacity to 2-1/2

2 million cubic yards, more than enough for one 50-year storm. It would cause far
W less environmental damage, air pollution, et cetera... appreciate the reduction that
† Supervisor Barger has proposed. It kind of splits the difference between the 1.1

5 and 2.4, but I wish it could be even smaller." See 11/7/2017 Board of Supervisors

6 Hearing Transcript, pp. 162-163.

7 98. At the hearing, Supervisor Barger also raised concerns about whether her Motion would

8 facilitate a reduction in the Project footprint, as requested by the City of Pasadena and others, and

9 whether the Reduced-Size Project could require the use of cleaner trucks than the Model Year 2010 haul

10 trucks planned for the Project. Staff provided incorrect or incomplete responses to her questions,

11 including incorrectly stating that the reduced-size Project footprint that had been proposed by the City of
Pasadena (which the Mayor colloquially described in oral comments as the "banjo") was no smaller than 12

13 the Project footprint proposed by the District:

14 a. Sup. Kathryn Barger: ...my one question to you is there is a discrepancy. so, the

15 construction footprint for this project is 69 acres. Is the construction footprint for the

16 Pasadena Working Group Plan different? I'm trying, because I've heard 40 acres and I've

17 heard 69 acres.

18 b. Mark Pestrella: supervisor, there is no difference between the footprint between the

19 Pasadena Plan and the County's, our proposal before you today. This is a difference in the
20 volumetric amount of material being proposed, as you're aware of.

21 c. Sup. Kathryn Barger: No, I understand, but the banjo versus the...

22 d. Mark Pestrella: No. There is no difference currently between the two plans.

23 e. Sup. Kathryn Barger: Okay, I just think that's an important clarification, because I know

24 when I met with the community groups, that was of concern. And you stated it was an

25 engineering way that this was done so the water flow.

26 f. Mark Pestrella: Correct.

27 g. Sup. Kathryn Barger: But I just want to make sure that we don't do any more than we

banjo, to quote Mayor Tornek. Also, as it relates to the trucks, clean energy trucks, or are

2 we going to a have a mandate in the RFP as it relates to what kind of trucks are going to be

3 hauling the sediment." See 11/7/2017 Board of Supervisors Hearing Transcript, pp. 176-

4 177.

5 99. At the close of the hearing, the Board voted to 1) approve the Reduced-Size Project,

6 reducing the maximum total volume of sediment removed during the Project by 700,000 cubic yards,

7 while maintaining the proposed footprint of the Project and haul trucks approved in the original FEIR, 2)

8 void portions of the Final Environmental Impact Report certified by the Board on November 12, 2014

9 that had been revised by the Recirculated Portions of the Final Environmental Impact Report, 3)

10 certified the RFEIR, 4) revise the Project's Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program, 5) adopt the

11 Statement of Overriding Considerations proposed in the RFEIR for the 2.4 mcy Project, and 6) made

12 related findings.

13 100. On or about November 8, 2017, a Notice of Determination for the Project was filed at the

14 County Clerk's Office and the State Clearinghouse.

15 101. On December 5. 2017, this Court held a hearing on Respondents' Motion to Discharge

16 the Writ in the Original Action. The Court's Ruling on the Motion held, in part, that "whether the

17 [District's] actions to reduce the Project in scope require additional CEQA analysis must be the subject

18 of a new petition." See 12/5/2017 Tentative Decision on Motion to Discharge Writ (adopted), Case No.

19 BS152771.

20 LEGAL BACKGROUND

21 CEOA

22 102. CEQA requires that an agency analyze the potential environmental impacts of its

23 proposed actions in an environmental impact report ("EIR") (except in certain limited circumstances).

24 See, e.g., § PRC § 21100.

25 103. The EIR is the very heart of CEQA. Dunn-Edwards v. BAAQMD (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th

26 644, 652. "The 'foremost principle' in interpreting CEQA is that the Legislature intended the act to be

27 read to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the

28 statutory language." a Cmtys. for a Better Env't v. Cal. Resources Agency (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98,

H 109.

2 104.

3 CEQA has two primary purposes. First, CEQA is designed to inform decision makers and

4 the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of a project. 14 CCR § 15002(a)(1). "Its

5 purpose is to inform the public and its responsible officials of the environmental consequences of their

6 decisions before they are made. Thus, the EIR 'protects not only the environment but also informed self-

7 | government.' Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564. The EIR has

8 been described as "an environmental 'alarm bell' whose purpose it is to alert the public and its

9 responsible officials to environmental changes before they have reached ecological points of no return.'

10 Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay v. Bd. of Port Comrs. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1354 ("Berkeley
Jets").

11 105.

12 Second, CEQA requires public agencies to avoid or reduce environmental damage when

13 "feasible" by requiring "environmentally superior" alternatives and all feasible mitigation measures. 14

14 CCR § 15002(a)(2) and (3); Citizens of Goleta Valley, supra, 52 Cal.3d at 564. The EIR serves to

15 provide agencies and the public with information about the environmental impacts of a proposed project

16 and to "identify ways that environmental damage can be avoided or significantly reduced." 14 CCR §

15002(a)(2).

17 106.

18 A lead agency may not approve a project if that project will have a significant effect on

19 the environment unless it has first adopted all feasible mitigation measures to eliminate or substantially

20 lessen all significant impacts of the project. PRC § 21002.1(a), (b); 21100(b)(3). In particular, CEQA

21 requires the lead agency to adopt feasible mitigation measures that will substantially lessen or avoid a

22 project's potentially significant environmental impacts (PRC §§ 21002, 21081(a)) and describe those

23 mitigation measures in the EIR. PRC § 21100(b)(3); 14 CCR § 15126.4. A public agency may not rely

24 on mitigation measures of uncertain efficacy or feasibility. Kings County Farm Bureau v. City of
Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 727.

25 107.

26 CEQA also disallows approval of a project that fails to comply with other laws. A lead

27 agency may not approve a project with significant unavoidable impacts unless it is "otherwise

28 permissible under applicable laws and regulations." PRC §21002.1(c).

108. If the a project will have a significant effect on the environment, the agency may approve

-24-
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

-

2 the project only if it finds that it has "eliminated or substantially lessened all significant effects on the

3 environment where feasible" and that any unavoidable significant effects on the environment are

4 "acceptable due to overriding concerns." PRC § 21081; 14 CCR § 15092(b)(2)(A) & (B).

109.

5 While the courts review an EIR using an "abuse of discretion" standard, "the reviewing

6 court is not to 'uncritically rely on every study or analysis presented by a project proponent in support of

7 its position. A clearly inadequate or unsupported study is entitled to no judicial deference.' Berkeley

8 Jets, supra, 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1355, quoting Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n v. Regents of

9 University of Cal. (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 391 409, fn. 12. Drawing this line and determining whether the

10 EIR complies with CEQA's information disclosure requirements presents a question of law subject to

11 independent review by the courts. Sierra Club v. Cnty. of Fresno (2014) 226 Cal. App. 4th 704, 725;

12 Madera Oversight Coalition, Inc. V. County of Madera (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 48, 102, 131.

110.

13 When challenging an agency's certification of an EIR under CEQA, abuse of discretion is

14 established if the agency: (1) has not proceeded in a manner required by law, or, (2) if the determination

15 or decision is not supported by substantial evidence. PRC § 21168.5. Substantial evidence is defined as

16 "enough relevant information and reasonable inferences from this information that a fair argument can

17 be made to support a conclusion, even though other conclusions might also be reached." 14 CCR §

18 15384(a). Substantial evidence includes facts, reasonable assumptions predicated on facts, and expert

19 opinion supported by facts; however, it does not include argument, speculation, or unsubstantiated
opinion or narrative. PRC §§ 21080(e), 21082.2(c).

20 Recirculation of EIR

21 111.

22 Recirculation of an EIR prior to certification, as here, is addressed in PRC § 21092.1, and

23 14 CCR §15088.5. "When significant new information is added to an environmental impact report after

24 notice has been given pursuant to Section 21092 ... but prior to certification, the public agency shall

25 give notice again pursuant to Section 21092, and consult again pursuant to Sections 21104 and 21153

26 before certifying the environmental impact report." PRC § 21092.1. §

112. "Significant new information" includes:

27

28 (1) A new significant environmental impact would result from the project or from a new mitigation measure proposed to be implemented.

-25-
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

(2) A substantial increase in the severity of an environmental impact would result.. (3) A feasible project alternative or mitigation measure considerably different from others
2 previously analyzed would clearly lessen the significant environmental impacts of the
project...
3 (4) The draft EIR was so fundamentally and basically inadequate and conclusory in

4 nature that meaningful public review and comment were precluded.

5 14 CCR $15088.5; Mountain Lion Coal. v. Fish and Game Comm'n (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1043

113.
6 In Laurel Heights Impr. Assn. v. Reg. of Univ. of Cal. (1993) 6 Cal. 4th 1112 ("Laurel

7 Heights IL'), the Supreme Court explained that Section 21092 favors EIR recirculation prior to
certification. The Court stated:
8 Section 21092.1 was intended to encourage meaningful public comment. (See State Bar
9 Rep., supra, at p. 28.) Therefore, new information that demonstrates that an EIR

10 commented upon by the public was so fundamentally and basically inadequate or conclusory in nature that public comment was in effect meaningless triggers recirculation

11 under section 21092.1. (See, Mountain Lion Coalition v. Fish & Game Com., supra, 214 Cal.App.3d 1043.)
12 Laurel Heights II, 6 Cal.4th at 1130 (emph. added).
13 Subsequent or Supplemental Environmental Review
14 114. A subsequent or supplemental EIR is required prior to certification and approval of a
15 Project when 1) "[s]ubstantial changes are proposed in the project,' 2) "[s]ubstantial changes occur with
16 respect to the circumstances under which the project is being undertaken" or when "[n]ew information,
17 which was not known and could not have known at the time the environmental impact report was
18 certified as complete, becomes available." PRC $ 21166.
19 115. Changes or modifications to a project, or changes to the circumstances under which the
20 project is undertaken, require a subsequent or supplemental EIR when the changes may result in "new
21 significant environmental effect or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified
22 significant effects." 14 CCR § 15162(a)(1 - 2).
23 116. CEQA Guidelines section 15162 further elucidates the situations in which a subsequent
24 or supplemental EIR must be prepared:
25 (1) Substantial changes are proposed in the project which will require major revisions of
26 the previous EIR or negative declaration due to the involvement of new significant

27 environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified
significant effects;
28 (2) Substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which the project is undertaken which will require major revisions of the previous EIR or negative declaration
-26-
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

due to the involvement of new significant environmental effects or a substantial increase a
in the severity of previously identified significant effects; or
2 (3) New information of substantial importance, which was not known and could not have

3 been known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time the previous EIR was certified as complete or the negative declaration was adopted, shows any of the

4 following: (A) The project will have one or more significant effects not discussed in the
5 previous EIR or negative declaration;
(B) Significant effects previously examined will be substantially more severe than
6 shown in the previous EIR;

7 (C) Mitigation measures alternatives previously found not to be feasible would
in fact be feasible and would substantially reduce one or more significant effects
8 of the project, but the project proponents decline to adopt the mitigation measure or alternative; or
9 (D) Mitigation measures or alternatives which are considerably different from

10 those analyzed in the previous EIR would substantially reduce one or more
significant effects on the environment, but the project proponents decline to adopt
11 the mitigation measure or alternative.

12 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15162(a).

13 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

14 117. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, §§ 526

15 (injunctive relief), 1060 (declaratory relief), 1085 (traditional mandate) and 1094.5 (administrative

16 mandate), PRC §§ 21168 and 21168.5 (judicial review under CEQA), and Government Code, § 65009 §

17 (actions challenging local government decisions). The Court has jurisdiction to issue declaratory relief

18 pursuant to CCP § 1060 and injunctive relief pursuant to CCP §§ 525 et seq.

19 118. Venue is proper in this Court in the first instance, pursuant to CCP §§ 394 (actions

20 against a city, county or local agency), and 395 (actions generally), since both the Respondents and the

21 Project site are located in the County of Los Angeles. Respondents include a local agency of the State of

22 California.

23 119. Venue is also proper in this Court because most Project activities will occur within the

24 County of Los Angeles, and the environmental impacts of the Project will be acutely felt within the

25 county. The cause alleged in this Petition, or some part of that cause, arise in this county. CCP § 393;

27 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES, INADEQUATE REMEDIES AT

28 LAW, AND JURISDICTION

-27-
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

H 120.

2 Petitioners have exhausted all available administrative remedies before Respondents in

3 objecting to the approval of the Project, as required by Public Resources Code section 21177, as set

4 forth above, by submitting timely written and oral comments to the District, including expert comments,

5 identifying significant deficiencies in the District's RDEIR and RFEIR prepared for the Project.

121.

6 Petitioners and other members of the public made written and oral comments identifying

7 deficiencies in the RDEIR and RFEIR. Their comments also addressed the District's failure to

8 adequately analyze the Reduced-Size Project, including, but not limited to the District's failure to

9 consider a reduced Project footprint, failure to consider reduced vegetation removal, and failure to

10 disclose the Project's significant cancer risk, and failure to consider reduced haul truck usage in light of

11 the significant reduction in sediment removal approved in the Reduced-Size Project.

122.

12 Petitioners adequately exhausted, or were not required to exhaust administrative
remedies, related to the Reduced-Size Project because:

13 a.

14 Petitioners and other members of the public, including public commenters, County staff

15 and Board members, exhausted administrative remedies related to the Reduced-Size

16 Project at the November 7, 2017 Board hearing by identifying each of the issues raised in

17 this amended petition prior to the close of the District's public hearing on the Project.

PRC § 21177(a).

18

19 b. There was inadequate opportunity for public comment on the Reduced-Size Project.

20 C. The available administrative remedies were inadequate.

21 d. The District failed to provide prior public notice of its intent to consider the Reduced-

22 Size Project, and inadequate opportunity for Petitioners to meaningfully object. PRC §
21177(e).

23

24 e. The District provided misleading and defective notice to the public by stating in its

25 November 7, 2017 Board Agenda and Staff Report that the District would consider the

26 Project and RFEIR as described RFEIR, and by failing to identify the Reduced-Size
Project.

27

28 f. The District's failure to notify the public of its intent to consider the Reduced-Size
Project prevented Petitioners from exhausting administrative remedies, and was the

-28-
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

H

2 equivalent of a denial of the opportunity to raise objections related to the Reduced-Size
Project.

3 123.

4 Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law, and thus seek a writ of

mandate from this Court.

5 124.

6 Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

7 21167.5 by mailing prior written notice of commencement of this action to Respondents, a copy of
which is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

8 125.

9 Petitioners will comply with the requirements of Public Resources Code section 21167.7

10 by providing notice of this action and a copy of the amended petition to the California Attorney General
within 10 days of the filing of this amended petition.

11 126.

12 Petitioners notified Respondents by a separate election that Petitioners elect to prepare

13 the record of the proceedings in compliance with Public Resources Code section 21167.6.(b)(2). A copy

14 of such notice was filed concurrently with the original Petition, and is attached hereto as Exhibit B.

127.

15 Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, as well as

16 Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.9, this Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of a

mandate.

17 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL

18 128.

19 This proceeding involves enforcement of important rights affecting the public interest.

20 Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a substantial benefit on the public, including

21 citizens, residents, businesses and taxpayers of Los Angeles County, and will result in the enforcement

22 of important public rights by requiring the County to comply with CEQA and other legal requirements

23 applicable to the proposed Project; by voiding the Project Approvals and prohibiting Respondents from

24 taking further actions with respect to the Project until it has complied with those legal requirements; and

25 by prohibiting the Respondents from undertaking any portion of the Project until the County has fully
complied with these legal requirements.

26 129.

27 Petitioner brings this action as a private attorney general pursuant to CCP $1021.5. The

28 necessity and financial burden of enforcement of these public rights entitle Petitioner to an award of
reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to that section.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (By Petitioners For Writ of Administrative Mandate Under CCP § 1094.5 and § PRC §211168 Or In The Alternative CCP § 1085 and PRC § 21168.5 Re: Violations of CEQA; RFEIR Does Not
3 Comply With CEQA. Against all Respondents, Real Parties in Interest and Defendants)

4 130. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate all of the above paragraphs as if fully set forth

5 herein.

6 131. CEQA requires the a lead agency for a project to prepare an EIR that complies with the

7 requirements of the statute. The lead agency also must provide for public review and comment on the

8 project and associated environmental documentation. An EIR must provide an adequate project

9 description and sufficient environmental analysis such that decision-makers can intelligently consider
10 environmental consequences when acting on the proposed project.
11 132. Where, as here, the lead agency conducts subsequent CEQA review of a previously
12 approved Project, CEQA requires the agency to consider whether substantial changes are proposed in
13 the project, whether substantial changes have occur with respect to the circumstances under which the
14
project is being undertake, and whether new information, which was not known and could not have
15

16 known at the time the environmental impact report was certified as complete, has becomes available

17 which demonstrates that the project may have new or more severed impacts, or require new mitigation

18 measures, than what was previously analyzed .

19 133. Respondents were at all times under a mandatory duty to comply with all requirements of

20 CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines. Respondents failed and refused to perform that duty.

21 134. Respondents modified and re-approved the Project despite the RFEIR's failure to

22 disclose that the Reduced-Size Project would have new and significant environmental impacts that were

23 not discussed in the previous FEIR or the RFEIR, that the Reduced-Size Project would result in a

24 substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant effects, and that new or additional

25 mitigation measures and alternatives to the Reduced-Size Project were available that may substantially

26 reduce the Project's significant impacts, including impacts that were found to be significant and

27 unavoidable in the RFEIR.

28

-30-
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

H 135.

2 The RFEIR fails to address new information of substantial importance which was not

3 known and could not have been known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time the previous

4 FEIR was certified; fails to consider mitigation measures and alternatives that became available due to

5 the reduced Project size which would substantially reduce one or more significant effects on the

6 environment; fails to address substantial changes made to the Project which requires major revisions of

7 the original FEIR; and fails to implement all feasible mitigation measures to reduce those significant

8 impacts to the extent feasible.

136. As the result of these deficiencies, the RFEIR fails to perform its function as an

10 informational document that is meant "to provide public agencies and the public in general with detailed

11 information about the effect which a proposed project is likely to have on the environment" and "to list

12 ways in which the significant effects of such a project might be minimized." Laurel Heights I, 47

13 Cal.3d 376 at 391.

14 137. CEQA requires the Court to establish whether an agency abused its discretion by

15

16 determining whether an agency failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and/or whether the
agency's decision is not supported by substantial evidence. PRC § 21168.

17 138.

18 Based on these legal standards, Respondents abused their discretion, exceeded their

19 jurisdiction and proceeded in a manner contrary to law without the support of substantial evidence in the

20 record by certifying a legally deficient RFEIR for the Project that failed to adequately analyze and

21 mitigate for the Project's environmental impacts, including but not limited to, in the following ways:

a.

22 Failing to adequately analyze and mitigate the Reduced-Size Project's impact on

23 air quality in light of new information which demonstrates that 2010 Model Year

24 trucks produce NOx emissions that are substantially higher than disclosed by the

25 District or analyzed in the original FEIR, and in light of substantial evidence

26 demonstrating that the Project's sediment removal operations would create a

27 significant cancer risk to sensitive receptors.

28

-31-
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

P b. Failing to adequately analyze and mitigate the new and more severe impacts

2 caused by modifications to Mitigation Measures Biological Resources 6 and 8,
3 which added adaptive management measures, including corrective regrading, soil
t 4o amendments, new plantings, closing trails and installing barriers. As approved in

the RFEIR, Mitigation Measures Biological Resources 6 and 8 will result in new

and significant, unmitigated impacts on biological and recreational resources that
7 were not addressed in the District's Return to Writ, and which may be
8
unnecessary if the Project footprint and vegetation removal plans were reduced in
9 conjunction with the Reduced-Size Project. 10 C.
11 Improperly deferring the development of mitigation measures. The RFEIR

12 improperly defers critical details regarding a number of the Project's mitigation

13 measures, including but not limited to the development of site-specific Habitat

14 Restoration Plan and performance standards related to the Reduced-Size Project.

15 d. Failing to adequately respond to public comments. The RFEIR fails to adequately

16 respond to a number of substantive issues raised by members of the public

17 regarding the Reduced-Size Project, including but not limited to, failing to

18 analyze a reduced Project footprint, failing to analyze whether vegetation removal

19 could be reduced in light of the Reduced-Size Project, failing to analyze whether

20 the Reduced-Size Project was capable of reducing the impacts from sediment

21 removal haul trucks, failing to identify and analyze new and more severe
22 environmental impacts that would be caused by (and could be further mitigated
23 by) by the Reduced Size Project's air quality and biological mitigation measures.
24 e. Failing to perform subsequent or supplemental environmental review. The Flood
25 Control District was required to perform subsequent or supplemental
26 environmental review because of substantial changes to the Project, changes in
27
circumstances, and new information related to the Reduced-Size Project that has
28

-32-
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- arisen since the original FEIR was certified in 2014, including but not limited to,

2 the following ways:
3 1. Making substantial changes to the Project, including reducing the amount
† 4o of sediment planned to be removed by 700,000 mcy, without revising the
RFEIR, and without analyzing whether the changes in the Project would
have new and significant impacts that were not previously analyzed in the
7 FEIR or RFEIR;
8
2. Making substantial changes to the Project, including reducing the amount
9 of sediment planned to be removed by 700,000 mcy, without considering 10 whether the Project revisions could facilitate the adoption of additional 11
mitigation measures to reduce the Project's significant impacts to less than 12
significant levels; 13
3. Making substantial changes to mitigation measures for the Project that will 14
likely have their own environmental impacts, including trail closures. 15

4. Failing to analyze whether the Reduced-Size Project could accommodate a 16

smaller Project footprint that would reduce the Project's significant 17

impacts on biological resources. 18

5. Failing to analyze whether sediment removal activities under the Reduced- 19

20 Size Project could be undertaken in a manner that would reduce the

21 Project's significant air quality and traffic impacts from the Project's haul

22 trucks.

23 6. Failing to address changed circumstances under which the Project is being
24 undertaken which required major revisions in the RFEIR, including, but
25 not limited to, the District's recognition a that a 2.4 mcy sized Project "may
26 not be necessary" and the Board's last-minute adoption of the Reduced-
27 Size Project at the November 7, 2017 District Board hearing.
28

-33-
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- 7. Failing to address new information demonstrating that the District

2 severely underestimated the Reduced-Size Project's dump truck emissions
3 and cancer risk from Project haul trucks, and whether additional
† 4o mitigation is available under the Reduced-Size Project to further reduce
those impacts to less than significant levels.

8. Failing to address new information related to the Reduced-Size Project in
7 the RFEIR, including new information that the Reduced-Size Project may
8
facilitate the implementation of mitigation measures and/or alternatives
9 that were previously considered infeasible, or which would substantially 10 reduce one or more significant effects of the Project, including, but not 11
limited to, reducing the number and frequency of haul trucks required to 12
remove sediment from the Project site, reducing the Project's footprint, 13
and reducing the amount of vegetation removal planned for the Project, all 14
of which the RFEIR concludes will result in significant impacts. 15

16 139. a As a result of the foregoing defects and others according to proof, Respondents

17 prejudicially abused their discretion by certifying an RFEIR that does not comply with CEQA and by

18 approving the Project in reliance thereon. Accordingly, Respondents' certification of the EIR and

19 approval of the Project must be set aside.

5 in the record, including but not limited to the following:

a.

6 The determination that the amended MMRP is adequately designed to ensure

7 compliance with the mitigation measures during implementation of the Reduced-

b.
9 The determination that the November 7, 2017 decision to approve the Reduced-

10 Size Project was within the within the scope of the FEIR, certified on November

11 12, 2014, together with the Recirculated Portions of the FEIR, and that there have

12 been no substantial changes to the Project despite Respondents' approval of the

13 Reduced-Size Project.

14 C. The determination that the November 7, 2017 decision to approve the Reduced-

15 Size Project made no substantial changes to the Project, and that the significant

19 outlined in the revisions to the previously adopted Environmental Findings of

Fact.
