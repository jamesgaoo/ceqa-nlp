- INTRODUCTION

2 1.

3 Petitioner and Plaintiff Inglewood Residents Against Takings And

4 Evictions ("Petitioner") hereby alleges violations of the Ralph M. Brown Act,

5 Government Code section 54950 et seq. and the California Environmental Quality

6 Act, by the Successor Agency to the Inglewood Redevelopment Agency ("Successor
Agency") and the Oversight Board To The Successor Agency To The Inglewood
7 Redevelopment Agency ("Oversight Board") ' (collectively, "Respondents"). These

8

9 violations benefited Real Party in Interest Murphy's Bowl LLC (the "Developer").
2. The Brown Act, also known as the California open meeting law, has a
10 clear and forcefully stated purpose: "In enacting this chapter, the Legislature finds

11

12 and declares that the public commissions, boards and councils and the other public
agencies in this State exist to aid in the conduct of the people's business. It is the
13 intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be
14 conducted openly. [1] The people of this State do not yield their sovereignty to the
15 agencies which serve them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their

16 public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is
17 not good for them to know. The people insist on remaining informed so that they may
18 retain control over the instruments they have created." (Gov. Code § 54950.)

19 3. To accomplish these vital goals, the Brown Act, inter alia, (1) requires
20 that an agenda be posted at least 72 hours before a regular meeting, (2) requires the

21

22 agenda include a brief description that is informative to the public of the action to be

23 taken, and (3) forbids action on any item not on that agenda. In this way, the Brown

24 Act serves to facilitate public participation in all phases of local government

25 decisionmaking and to curb misuse of the democratic process by secret legislation of

26

27 As explained below, as of July 1, 2018, the Successor Agency was dissolved and its powers,

28 duties, and liabilities were taken over by the Los Angeles County Second District Consolidated Oversight Board. For clarity's sake, this petition refers to the Oversight Board throughout but such reference includes the Second District Consolidated Oversight Board.

public bodies. (San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Center v. County of Merced (2013) 216

2 Cal.App.4th 1167, 1176.)
4. At its June 19, 2018 meeting, Respondent Successor Agency took action on

a matter not properly noticed putting Petitioner and the public in a position where they
could not have reasonably understood the nature of the action or the implications of the

6 same. More specifically, the Successor Agency acted to further the disposition of 13

7 parcels of property that would be used for construction of a sports arena project ("Land

8 Transfer"). However, neither the notice for the meeting, the agenda nor the available

9 meeting materials specifically identify the land or the reasons for the Land Transfer in a

10 way that would adequately inform the public of the nature of the action the Successor

11 Agency purported to take.

12 5. At its June 27, 2018 meeting, Respondent Oversight Board similarly took
13 action on a matter not properly noticed putting Petitioner and the public in a position

14 where they could not have reasonably understood the nature of the action or the

15 implications of the same: More specifically, the Oversight Board acted to facilitate the

16 Land Transfer. However, neither the notice for the meeting, the agenda, nor the available

17 meeting materials specifically identify the land or the reasons for the Land Transfer in a

18 way that would adequately inform the public of the nature of the action the Oversight

19 Board purported to take.

20 6. The Land Transfer would dispose properties that are included within an

21 Exclusive Negotiating Agreement ("ENA") among the City of Inglewood, the Successor

22 Agency, the Inglewood Parking Authority and Murphy's Bowl LLC for a sports arena for

23 the Clippers basketball team (the "Arena Project").

24 7. These meetings violated the Brown Act. The Successor Agency and

25 Oversight Board failed to inform the public that they were taking actions in furtherance

26 of the effort to dispose properties pursuant to an agreement with extensive potential

27 impacts on thousands of Inglewood residents and businesses. The agenda for each

28 meeting merely stated each agency would act to implement the Long Range Property

3
Printed on Recycled Paper VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BROWN ACT

1 Management Plan, without stating what that implementation entailed. Contrary to Brown

2 Act requirements, this description was overly vague and uninformative. It did not inform

3 the public that the property disposition actions are taken in furtherance of the ENA for

4 the Clippers Arena and involving Murphy's Bowl LLC. It failed to inform the public that

5 the parcels being transferred are specifically designated in maps in the ENA for

6 construction of the Arena Project.

7 8. This failure to adequately inform the public is consistent with and further
8 evidence of the City of Inglewood's deliberate attempts to obfuscate the true nature of

9 actions taken to facilitate the Clippers Arena Project. Such actions were the subject of

10 Karen Foshay's March 15, 2018 article entitled "Documents Show How Inglewood

11 Clippers Arena Deal Stayed Secret." This article included a complete copy of a June 9,

12 2017 email between Clippers and City of Inglewood representatives stating "the entity

13 [Murphy's a Bowl LLC] will have a generic name so it won't identify the proposed

14 project."

15 9. Respondents' actions reflect a continuing course of conduct deliberately
16 designed to obfuscate the subject of public business being conducted. These actions

17 violate the Brown Act.

18 10. Additionally, Petitioner challenges the Respondents' actions under the

19 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). Respondents have forced the filing of

20 this action by ignoring California's procedural rules and laws designed to ensure

21 environmental protection, ignoring the interests of the community, and rushing to
22 facilitate a sports arena development that could displace families and businesses, small
23 and large, for a billionaire's benefit. Respondents' actions purportedly facilitate the Land
24 Transfer pursuant to the ENA2 for the Arena Project.

25

26

27 The ENA was amended and restated on August 15, 2017 but its essential terms remained the
28 same and was approved by the Oversight Board on September 7, 2017. Therefore, this Petition refers throughout to "the ENA" and, where relevant, "the Revised ENA."

AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BROWN ACT

•

11. The ENA sets forth and specifically details the Arena Project's scope and

2 even defines it as a "Project." The level of detail the ENA and staff report contain on the

3 Arena Project was more than enough to complete environmental review. The ENA states

4 that Respondents will convey property "to the Developer for development as a premier

5 and state of the art National Basketball Association ('NBA') professional basketball

6 arena consisting of approximately 18,000 to 20,000 seats as well as related landscaping,
7 parking and various other ancillary uses related to and compatible with the operation and
8 promotion of a state-of-the-art NBA arena on the Site." (ENA, at pp. 1-2.) The staff
report for the June 15, 2017, special meeting also confirms that the ENA's purpose is to
10 "facilitate the development of a premier and state-of-the-art National Basketball
11 Association ('NBA') professional basketball arena consisting of approximately 18,000 to
12 20,000 seats." The Arena Project's size and location are all that is needed for the City to

13 conduct environmental review as they establish the parameters of the project's impacts.
14 No additional information is needed to study the Arena Project's environmental impacts,
15 yet the Respondents seem to have kicked the proverbial can down the road and decided to
16 possibly do environmental reiiew later. CEQA requires more and Respondents' decision
17 to ignore their obligations under state law cannot and should not be countenanced.

18 12. Despite specifically defining the Arena Project in the ENA, Respondents
19 have prepared no environmental review for the Arena Project before taking actions to
20 facilitate the Arena Project. The Successor Agency already agreed that for three years it
21 would "not negotiate with or consider any offers or solicitations from, any person or
22 entity, other than the Developer, regarding a Disposition and Development Agreement
23 for the sale, lease, disposition, and/or development of the Site." (ENA, at § 2(a).)
24 13. Respondents' decision to approve actions to facilitate the Land Transfer
25 prior to completing environmental review violates CEQA. CEQA prohibits a
26 government entity from taking actions that foreclose alternatives or potential mitigation
27 measures before performing the requisite environmental review. The actions to facilitate
28 the Land Transfer create significant commitments to and momentum for the Arena

5
Printed on Recycled Paper VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BROWN ACT

1 Project. As such, Respondents will undoubtedly ignore the environmental impacts that

2 any future environmental review may uncover, and potentially superior alternative

3 projects, in pursuit of the Arena Project. The Land Transfer will result in significant

4 environmental impacts that must be analyzed in an Environmental Impact Report

5 ("EIR"), disclosed to the public and considered by Respondents prior to approving

6 actions to facilitate the Land Transfer. Respondents' failure to do so violated CEQA.
14. Respondents' disregard for the community's and the City's well-being, of

8 their obligations under CEQA, for how the Land Transfer and the Arena Project will
9 significantly impact the environment, and the requirement to comply with the Brown
10 Act's agenda description requirements necessitate this challenge to Respondents'
11 respective purported approvals of the actions to facilitate the Land Transfer.

12 PARTIES TO THIS PROCEEDING

13 15. Petitioner Inglewood Residents Against Takings And Evictions is an
14 unincorporated association that opposes the ENA, the Land Transfer, and the City's,

15 Successor Agency's, Parking Authority's, and Oversight Board's approvals to facilitate

16 the development of the Arena Project by Developer in a residential area and the use of
17 eminent domain to acquire property to develop the Arena Project. Petitioner and its

18 members will be adversely impacted by the Land Transfer as it will result in significant
19 impacts to the environment including blight and urban decay, the loss of existing

20 businesses and jobs, and will facilitate development that is inconsistent with the City's
21 Zoning and General Plan. Petitioner and its members will also be adversely impacted by

22 the environmental impacts created by the Arena Project's construction and operation,

23 including impacts to air quality, traffic congestion, nighttime lighting, and noise.

24 16. Respondent and Defendant Successor Agency is responsible for overseeing
25 the winding down of redevelopment activity at the local level under the Redevelopment
26 Law, including managing existing redevelopment projects, making payments on
27 enforceable obligations, and disposing of redevelopment assets and properties. On or
28 about January 10, 2012, pursuant to the Redevelopment Law dissolution legislation (AB

6
Printed on Recycled Paper VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BROWN ACT

X1 26 as amended by AB 1484), the City elected to be the Successor Agency to the

2 Redevelopment Agency of the City of Inglewood. The Redevelopment Agency was

3 officially dissolved on or about February 1, 2012.

4 17. Respondent and Defendant Oversight Board To The Successor Agency To

5 The Inglewood Redevelopment Agency is the governing body of the entity that under the

6 Health and Safety Code must approve Successor Agency agreements with the City of
7 Inglewood prior to the Successor Agency approving those agreements. Inglewood's

8 Mayor Butts was the chair of the Oversight Board at all times relevant to this action.

0 18. Respondent and Defendant Los Angeles County Second District

10 Consolidated Oversight Board is the successor in interest to the Oversight Board.
11 Pursuant to Health and Safety Code Section 34179 subdivision (j), as of July 1, 2018, the
12 Oversight Board was dissolved and its duties, responsibilities, and liabilities were taken
13 over by the Second District Consolidated Oversight Board.

14 19. Real Party in Interest, Murphy's Bowl LLC, is a Delaware Limited

15 Liability Company. Real Party in Interest is the designated developer of the Arena
16 Project under the ENA.

17 20. Petitioner does not know the true names or capacities, whether individual,
18 corporate, associate or otherwise, of Respondent Does through 10, or of Real Parties in

19 Interest Roes 10-20, inclusive, and therefore sues said Respondents and Real Parties in
20 Interest under fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this Petition to show their true

21 names and capacities when and if the same has been ascertained.

22 JURISDICTION AND VENUE
23 21. This Court has jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to California
24 Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 and 1094.5; and Government Code sections 54960,
25 54960.1, and 54960.2; and Public Resource Code sections 21168 and 21168.5.

26 22. Venue in this Court is proper pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
27 394, in that Respondents are located within the County of Los Angeles.

1 23. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Government Code section

2 54960.1 and 54960.2 by delivering to the Oversight Board on June 29, 2018 a letter

3 demanding that the Oversight Board cure or correct and cease and desist its Brown Act

4 violations. A copy of the letter is attached hereto as Exhibit C.

5 24. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Government Code section
6 54960.1 and 54960.2 by delivering to the Successor Agency on June 29, 2018 a letter
7 demanding that the Successor Agency cure or correct and cease and desist its Brown Act

8 violations. A copy of the letter is attached hereto as Exhibit D.

9 25. Neither Respondent has responded to these letters.

10 THE RALPH M. BROWN ACT.

11 26. The Brown Act provides that "[a]t least 72 hours before a regular meeting,

12 the legislative body of the local agency, or its designee, shall post an agenda containing a
13 brief general description of each item of business to be transacted or discussed at the

14 meeting, including items to be discussed in closed session. A brief general description of

15 an item generally need not exceed 20 words. The agenda shall specify the time and
16 location of the regular meeting and shall be posted in a location that is freely accessible to
17 members of the public and on the local agency's Internet Web site, if the local agency has
18 one." (Gov. Code § 54954.2 subd. (a)(1).)

19 27. The Brown Act further provides that "[n]o action or discussion shall be

20 undertaken on any item not appearing on the posted agenda, except that members of a

21 legislative body or its staff may briefly respond to statements made or questions posed by

22 persons exercising their public testimony rights under Section 54954.3." (Gov. Code §

23 54954.2 subd. (a)(3).)

24

25 CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT

26 28. The California Environmental Quality Act, found at Public Resources Code
27 Section 21000 et seq., is based on the principle that "the maintenance of a quality

28

8
Printed on Recycled Paper VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BROWN ACT

1 environment for the people of this state now and in the future is a matter of statewide
2 concern." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21000, subd. (a).)*
29. In CEQA, the Legislature has established procedures designed to achieve
these goals, principally the EIR. These procedures provide both for the determination

5 and for full public disclosure of the potential adverse effects on the environment of

6 discretionary projects that governmental agencies propose to approve, and require a

7 description of feasible alternatives to such proposed projects and feasible mitigation

8 measures to lessen their environmental harm. (Pub. Resources Code § 21002.)
9 30. The Guidelines require "all phases of project planning, implementation, and
10 operation" to be considered in the Initial Study for a project. (Guidelines §15063, subd.
11 (a)(1).) CEQA defines a project as "the whole of an action, which has a potential for
12 resulting in either a direct physical change to the environment, or a reasonably
13 foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment." (Guidelines § 15378, subd.
14 (a).)

15 31. CEQA is not merely a procedural statute. CEQA imposes clear and
16 substantive responsibilities on agencies that propose to approve projects, requiring that
17 public agencies not approve projects that harm the environment unless and until all

18 feasible mitigation measures are employed to minimize that harm. (Pub. Resources

19 Code§§ 21002, 21002.1, subd. (b).)

20 32. The alternatives analysis is the "core of the EIR." (Citizens of Goleta Valley
21 V. Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564.) The purpose of a CEQA alternatives
22 analysis is to identify and analyze alternatives to a project that will avoid or substantially
23 lessen its significant environmental impacts. (Pub. Resources Code § 21002.) Thus,
24 "before conducting CEQA review, agencies must not 'take any action' that significantly
25 furthers a project 'in a manner that forecloses alternatives or mitigation measures that
26

27 3 CEQA authorizes and directs the State Office of Planning and Research to adopt guidelines for the implementation of CEQA by public agencies. (Pub. Resources Code § 21083.) These 28 guidelines are found at title 14, California Code of Regulations, Sectión 15000 et seq. ("Guidelines") and are binding on all state and local agencies, including Respondents.
9
Printed on Recycled Paper VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BROWN ACT

1 would ordinarily be part of CEQA review of that public project." (Save Tara V. City of

2 West Hollywood (2008) 45 Cal.4th 116, 138.)

3 33. Agencies may not undertake discretionary actions that could have a

4 significant adverse effect on the environment, or limit the choice of alternatives or

5 mitigation measures, before complying with CEQA. (Guidelines §15004, subd. (b)(2).)

6 The "lead agency," which is the public agency that has the principal responsibility for

7 carrying out the project, is responsible for conducting an initial study to determine, in

8 consultation with other relevant state agencies, whether an environmental impact report, a
9 negative declaration, or a mitigated negative declaration will be prepared for a project.

10 (Pub. Resources Code §§ 21067; 21080.1, subd. (a); 21083, subd. (a).) Accordingly,

11 public agencies may not "take any action" that furthers project "in a manner that

12 forecloses alternatives or mitigation measures that would ordinarily be part of CEQA

13 review of that public project." (Save Tara, supra, 45 Cal.4th at 138.)

14 34. Thus, CEQA does not permit the postponement of environmental review

15 "to the point where the 'bureaucratic and financial momentum*"* has built up "irresistibly
16 behind a proposed project 'thus providing a strong incentive to ignore environmental

17 concerns.'" (Save Tara, supra, 45 Cal.4th at 135.)

18 35. Failure either to comply with the substantive requirements of CEQA or to

19 carry out the full CEQA procedures so that complete information as to a project's impacts
20 is developed and publicly disclosed constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion that

21 requires invalidation of the public agency action regardless of whether full compliance
22 would have produced a different result. (Pub. Resources Code § 21005.)

23 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

24 36. On June 15, 2017, the City, the City Council, the Successor Agency, and

25 the Parking Authority each purported to hold a special meeting (the "Special Meeting")
26 pursuant to Government Code Section 54956. At the Special Meeting, Respondents
27 purported to approve the ENA among the City, the Successor Agency, the Authority and
28 the Developer "to facilitate the development of a premier and state-of-the-art National
10
Printed on Recycled Paper VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

• PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BROWN ACT

,

1 Basketball Association ('NBA') professional basketball arena consisting of
2 approximately 18,000 to 20,000 seats."

3 37. On July 20, 2017, Petitioner filed a petition alleging violation of CEQA and

4 fair meeting requirements.

5 38. The Inglewood City Council held a meeting on August 15, 2017. At the

6 August hearing, the City Council approved a "Revised ENA" which contained many of

7 the same terms as the prior ENA and a revised map of the project area purporting to

8 reduce the area of potential eminent domain use. City councilmembers stated it was not

9 the City's intention to take houses or a church by eminent domain. A map attached to the
10 Revised ENA removed many residences from the boundaries of the project area.

11 However, the Mayor and other councilmembers refused to forego the use of eminent

12 domain altogether.

13 39. On September 7, 2017, Inglewood's Oversight Board to the Successor
14 Agency to the Inglewood Redevelopment Agency, which is chaired by the Mayor of
15 Inglewood, approved the Revised ENA as consistent with a long range property
16 management plan and Redevelopment Dissolution Law.
17 40. The ENA provides for the conveyance of certain real property within a
18 defined "Site"-including property owned by the City (**City Parcels"), by the Successor
19 Agency ("Agency Parcels") and by third parties ("Potential Participating Parcels") --to
20 the Developer, for the Arena Project.
21 41. In approving the ENA, Respondents did not consider the environmental

22 impacts of either the ENA or the Arena Project. No environmental review was conducted

23 with respect to the ENA's approval. The ENA is a project under CEQA that has the
24 potential to result in significant physical changes in the environment. Respondents erred
25 by not conducting environmental review for the ENA.

3 42. On June 19, 2018, Respondent Successor Agency took steps to implement

4 the ENA by taking action to facilitate the Land Transfer. The Successor Agency's

5 agenda stated the following:

6 A. CSA-3. OFFICE OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

7 Staff report recommending approval to request that the Oversight Board for the Successor Agency of the Former Inglewood Redevelopment Agency adopt a
8 Resolution, directing the Successor Agency to implemeni the State of California Department of Finance approved Long-Range Property Management Plan, as
9 amended, with respect to the Long-Term Use and Disposition of the LAX Noise Mitigation Properties, B-1.1 through and including B-3, representing Parcels
10 through and including 13, subject to the applicable disposition requirements of the Federal Aviation Administration grant agreements and Los Angeles World Airports
11 letter agreements. (Emphasis added.)

12 43. Contrary to Brown Act requirements, the Successor Agency's agenda

13 description was overly vague and uninformative. It does not inform the public that the

14 property disposition actions are taken in furtherance of the ENA for the Clippers Arena

15 and involve Murphy's Bowl LLC. It fails to inform the public, and does not alert the

16 public to the fact, that the parcels being transferred are specifically designated in maps in

17 the ENA for construction of the arena project.

18 44. The Successor Agency also failed to make available the "Federal Aviation

19 Administration grant agreements and Los Angeles World Airports letter agreements" to

20 the public.

21 45. The Successor Agency's failure to adequately inform the public is

22 consistent with and further evidence of the City of Inglewood's deliberate attempts to

23 obfuscate the true nature of actions taken to facilitate the Clippers arena project. This

24 purposeful obfuscation by the City and Murphy's Bowl was reported by Karen Foshay in

25 a story entitled "Documents Show How Inglewood Clippers Arena Deal Stayed Secret,"

26 for KCET on March 15, 2018 and is available at https://www.kcet.org/shows/socal-

27 connected/documents-show-how-inglewood-clippers-arena-deal-stayed-secret. This

28 story reported a June 9, 2017 email between Clippers and City of Inglewood

12
Printed on Recycled Paper VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PURSUANT TO CEQÀ AND BROWN ACT

representatives stating "the entity [Murphy's Bowl LLC] will have a generic name so it

2 won't identify the proposed project." Therefore, the City and Murphy's Bowl

3 purposefully obscured the identity of the parties involved in the ENA and subsequent
transactions with a "generic name."
46. On June 19, 2018, Respondent Successor Agency approved the action to

6 facilitate the Land Transfer to dispose of 13 parcels of property that would be used for
7 construction of the Clippers sports arena project in violation of CEQA and the Brown

8 Act. The Successor Agency acted to facilitate the disposal of the following properties

9 that are included within the ENA:

10 Property Name Parcel Number on LRPMP Inventory
11 a. Prairie & 101st (B-1.1) F

12 b. Prairie & 102nd (B-1.2) 2, 3

26 47. Respondent Oversight Board on June 27, 2018 took steps to implement the
27 ENA by taking action to facilitate the Land Transfer. This action violated the Brown Act

28 and CEQA. The Oversight Board failed to inform the public that the properties are

1 proposed to be disposed of pursuant to an agreement with extensive potential impacts on

2 thousands of Inglewood residents and businesses. The brief description on the Oversight

3 Board agenda for its June 27, 2018 meeting stated:
7 00 Adoption of Resolution by the Oversight Board to the Successor Agency of the former Inglewood Redevelopment Agency Directing the City of Inglewood as the Successor Agency to ormer Inglewood Redevelopment Agency to Implement the approved Long-Range Property Management Plan, as amended, with respect to the Long-Term Use and Disposition of the LAX Noise Mitigation Properties, B-1.1 through and including B-3, representing Parcels 1 through and including 13, subject to the applicable Disposition Requirements of the Federal Aviation Administration grant
cc agreements and Los Angeles World Airports letter agreements. (Emphasis added.)
48. Contrary to Brown Act requirements, the Oversight Board's agenda

10 description was overly vague and uninformative. It does not inform the public that the

11 property disposition actions are taken in furtherance of the ENA for the Clippers Arena
and involve Murphy's Bowl LLC. It fails to inform the public, and does not alert the 12 public to the fact, that the parcels being transferred are specifically designated in maps in 13
the ENA for construction of the Arena Project.

12 51. In taking action to facilitate the Land Transfer, Respondents did not
13 evaluate the potential environmental impacts of the Land Transfer. Respondents' failure
14 to consider the Land Transfers' potential environmental impacts violated CEQA.
15 52. Petitioner on June 29, 2018, pursuant to Government Code section 54960.1,
16 demanded that the Oversight Board cure or correct its violations of the Brown Act within
17 30 days. The Oversight Board failed to do so.

18 53. Petitioner on June 29, 2018, pursuant to Government Code section 54960.1,
19 demanded that the Successor Agency cure or correct its violations of the Brown Act

20 within 30 days. The Successor Agency failed to do so.

21 54. The Land Transfer is a "project" under CEQA, as defined by Guidelines
22 section 15378. Respondents' actions to facilitate the Land Transfer is an "approval"
23 under CEQA as defined by Guidelines section 15352. The Land Transfer may cause a
24 direct and/or reasonably foreseeable indirect environmental change. Therefore, the Land
25 Transfer is subject to CEQA review.

26 55. In failing to subject the action to facilitate the Land Transfer to CEQA
27 review, Respondents ignored the impact that the Land Transfer will have on the
28 environment. Respondents are prohibited from engaging in negotiations with anyone
15
Printed on Recycled Paper VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BROWN ACT

F other than the Developer regarding the potential development of the Site. (ENA, § 2(a).)

2 Further, the ENA prohibits Respondents from selling or otherwise transferring to third

3 parties their interests in any property on the Site. (ENA, § 11.)

4 56. In failing to subject the action to facilitate the Land Transfer to CEQA

5 review, Respondents did not consider, and did not inform the public of, direct and

6 reasonably foreseeable indirect environmental impacts that will occur as a result of the

7 Land Transfer, including but not limited to land use consistency and urban decay and

8 blight.

9 57. The action to facilitate the approval of the Land Transfer is subject to

10 CEQA because it will result in significant land use impacts.

11 58. In sum, Respondents have failed to consider the Land Transfer's potential

12 and reasonably foreseeable environmental impacts, including:

13 Environmental impacts of noise, traffic, air pollution, aesthetics, and other

14 impacts;

15 Effects on land use inconsistent with the City's General Plan; and

16 Increases in urban decay and blight.

17 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

18 (Failure to Comply with CEQA: Failure to Conduct Initial Study

19 and/or Environmental Assessment)

20 59. Petitioner incorporates herein and realleges the allegations in prior

21 paragraphs, as if fully set forth herein.

22 60. CEQA applies "to discretionary projects proposed to be carried out or
23 approved by public agencies. .. ." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21080, subd. (a).)

24 61. CEQA defines a "project" as "an activity which may cause either a direct
25  physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change
26 in the environment. ..." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21065.) The Guidelines define

27 "project" as "the whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in either a direct a

28

16
Printed on Recycled Paper VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BROWN ACT

1 physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change

2 in the environment." (Guidelines, § 15371, subd. (a).)

3 62. The Guidelines define "approval" to mean "the decision by a public agency

4 which commits the agency to a definite course of action in regard a to a project intended to

5 be carried out by any person." (Guidelines § 15352, subd. (a).)
63. Respondents' approval of actions to facilitate the Land Transfer constitutes

7 a discretionary project that will cause foreseeable, adverse physical changes to the

8 environment and is, therefore, subject to CEQA review. (See City of Livermore v.

9 LAFCO (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 531 [adoption of revisions to sphere-of-influence
10 guidelines constitute a "project" subject to CEQA review because the revisions reflected

11 a major policy shift relating to where growth would occur and what the focus of urban

12 development would be].)

13 64. "Obviously it is desirable that the precise information concerning

14 environmental consequences which an EIR affords be furnished and considered at the

15 earliest possible stage. The Guidelines express this principle in a variety of ways. Thus,
16 'EIR's should be prepared as early in the planning process as possible to enable
17 environmental considerations to influence project, program or design.' [citation.]."
18 (Bozung V. Local Agency Formation Com. (1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 282.) "Decisions
19 reflecting environmental considerations could most easily be made when other basic

20 decisions were being made, that is, during the early stage of project conceptualization,

21 design and planning." (Citizens for Responsible Gov't v. City of Albany (1997) 56
22 Cal.App.4th 1199, 1221 (quotations omitted).)

23 65. Respondents failed to consider, avoid or mitigate the individual and
24 cumulative impacts of reasonably foreseeable environmental impacts resulting from the
25 actions facilitating the approval of the Land Transfer. Such impacts include noise, traffic,

26 air quality, aesthetics, land use inconsistency, urban decay and blight.
27 66. Respondents have violated CEQA and failed to proceed in the manner
28 reguired by law, committed : prejudicial abuse of discretion, and acted arbitrarily and
17
Printed on Recycled Paper VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BROWN ACT

capriciously in their approval of the Land Transfer because, without limitation,

2 Respondents failed to subject the Land Transfer to an Initial Study or other

3 environmental assessment as required by CEQA.

4 67. Petitioner has served the California Attorney General with a copy a of this

5 amended verified petition, along with a notice of its filing, in compliance with Public

6 Resources Code section 21167.7. A true and correct copy of that notice and proof of

7 service is attached as Exhibit A hereto.

8 68. Petitioner has provided written notice of the commencement of this action

9 to Respondents, in compliance with Public Resources Code section 21167.5. A true and
10 correct copy of that notice and proof of service is attached as Exhibit B hereto.

11 69. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing a CEQA
12 action against Respondents, and has exhausted any and all available administrative
13 remedies to the extent required by law.

14 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (Failure to Comply with CEQA: Improper Deferral

16 of Environmental Analysis)

17 70. Petitioner incorporates herein and realleges the allegations in prior
18 paragraphs, as if fully set forth herein.

19 71. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that Respondents
20 | have deferred analysis under CEQA for the Arena Project.

21 72. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that the actions to
22 facilitate the Land Transfer commit Respondents to a definite course of action with

23 respect to the Arena Project by, for example, defining now, before any CEQA studies

24 occur, which parts of the City should be considered for the proposed Arena Project and

25 the acceptable size of the proposed Arena Project.

26 73. The actions to facilitate the Land Transfer commits Respondents to a
27 definite course of action that will cause numerous adverse environmental effects that
28 should have been studied in an EIR before the Land Transfer was approved.
18
Printed on Recycled Paper VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BROWN ACT

1 74. By taking the actions to facilitate the Land Transfer, Respondents have
2 displayed a level of commitment to the Arena Project that is more than sufficient to

3 constitute a "project approval."
75. By taking the actions to facilitate the Land Transfer, Respondents have
circumscribed or limited their discretion with respect to future environmental review,

6 mitigation measures, project alternatives and alternative locations.

7 76. The Guidelines are clear that Respondents are barred from taking actions

8 "that would have a significant adverse effect or limit the choice of alternatives or

9 mitigation measures, before completion of CEQA compliance." (Guidelines § 15004,
10 subd. (b)(2)(emphasis added).)

11 77. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that Respondents'
12 taking the actions to facilitate the Land Transfer constitutes such an unauthorized action

13 because it limits Respondents' choices of methods to eliminate and/or mitigate adverse
14 environmental impacts generated by the Land Transfer.

15 78. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that the Land
16 Transfer constitutes a prejudgment by Respondents on the proposed Arena Project and
17 the proposed Site.

18 79. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that the Land

19 Transfer commits Respondents to a definite course of action and SO constrains
20 Respondents' exercise of police power such that the future CEQA review envisioned by

21 the Land Transfer is rendered an unlawful post hoc rationalization for decisions and

22 commitments already made.

23 80. Any later-performed environmental analysis will be influenced in its
24 discussion of impacts, mitigation and alternatives by the significant funds already given
25 to the City by the Developer.

26 81. Respondents have violated CEQA and failed to proceed in the manner
27 required by law, committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion, and acted arbitrarily and
28 capriciously in their approval of the Land Transfer because Respondents committed
19
Printed on Recycled Paper VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BROWN ÄCT

1 themselves to a definite course of action, i.e. the Arena Project, before complying with
2 CEQA, and improperly deferred CEQA analysis of the Arena Project to a later time.

3 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

4 (Violation of Ralph M. Brown Act, Gov. Code § 54954.1 and 54954.2).
82. Petitioner incorporates herein and realleges the allegations in prior
6 paragraphs, as if fully set forth herein.

7 83. The purpose of the Ralph M. Brown Act is to "aid in the conduct of the
8 people's business" by encouraging public participation in government decision making.
9 (Government Code §54950.)

10 84. In furtherance of its goal of public participation, the Brown Act requires

11 that at least 72 hours before a regular meeting, a legislative body must post an agenda
12 containing a "brief description" of each item of business to be acted upon at the meeting.

13 (Government Code § 54954.2(a)(1).)

14 85. The legislative body may not take any action on an item not appearing on
15 the posted agenda, except in certain situations not applicable here. (Government Code §§
16 54952(a)(3), 54954.2(b).)

17 86. The Successor Agency violated the Brown Act by failing to properly list in
18 the agenda for the June 19, 2018 Successor Agency meeting the actions to be taken at
19 that meeting. Specifically, the posted agenda listed no item of business describing that

20 the Successor Agency would consider disposition of properties included within an

21 Exclusive Negotiating Agreement between the City of Inglewood, the Successor Agency,

22 the Parking Authority, and Murphy's Bowl, LLC for construction of a sports arena.

23 87. The Successor Agency agenda for the meeting disclosed only that the

24 Successor Agency would "request that the Oversight Board for the Successor Agency of
25 the Former Inglewood Redevelopment Agency adopt a Resolution, directing the

26 Successor Agency to implement the State of California Department of Finance approved
27 Long-Range Property Management Plan, as amended, with respect to the Long-Term Use
28 and Disposition of the LAX Noise Mitigation Properties, B-1.1 through and including B-
20
Printed on Recycled Paper VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PURSUANT TO CEOA AND BROWN ÁCT

1 3, representing Parcels through and including 13, subject to the applicable disposition
2 requirements of the Federal Aviation Administration grant agreements and Los Angeles

3 World Airports letter agreements."

4 88. The Successor Agency failed to inform the public that it was proposing to

5 dispose of properties pursuant to an agreement with extensive potential impacts on

6 hundreds of Inglewood residents and businesses. The Successor Agency failed to inform
the public of any connection between the listed agenda item and the construction of the
8 Arena Project.

9 89. The Successor Agency failed to make available to the public the "Federal
10 Aviation Administration grant agreements and Los Angeles World Airports letter
11 agreements."

12 90. Thus, the agenda's description was overly vague, and the Successor
13 Agency's action was not adequately or accurately described on the agenda, in violation of
14 the Brown Act.

15 91. The Successor Agency further violated the Brown Act by not making
16 available the Federal Aviation Administration grant agreements and Los Angeles World
17 Airports letter agreements to the public.

18 92. Petitioner IRATE was prejudiced by this violation because it was denied
19 the opportunity to prepare and provide meaningful comments to the Successor Agency on
20 the implementation of the amended Long-Range Property Management Plan, the
21 applicable disposition requiremenits of the "Federal Aviation Administration grant
22 agreements and Los Angeles World Airports letter agreements," the disposition of
23 Parcels 1 through 13, and the interaction between the disposition of the properties and the
24 Arena Project or to ascertain the extent to which the implementation of the Long-Range
25 Property Management Plan or requirements of the "Federal Aviation Administration
26 grant agreements and Los Angeles World Airports letter agreements" would affect the
27 interests of IRATE's members.

28

21
Printed on Recycled Paper VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BROWN ACT

93. On June 29, 2018, pursuant to Government Code section 54960.1(b),

2 IRATE timely submitted a demand to the Successor Agency to cure or correct the action

3 taken on June 19, 2018 in violation of the Brown Act. The Successor Agency did not

4 respond.

5 94. The Oversight Board violated the Brown Act by failing to properly list in

6 the agenda for the June 27, 2018 Oversight Board meeting the actions to be taken at that

7 meeting. Specifically, the posted agenda listed no item of business describing that the

8 Oversight Board would consider disposition of properties included within an Exclusive

9 Negotiating Agreement between the City of Inglewood, the Successor Agency, the
10 Parking Authority, and Murphy's Bowl, LLC for construction of a sports arena.

11 95. The Oversight Board agenda for its June 27, 2018 meeting disclosed the
12 Board would consider: "Adoption of Resolution by the Oversight Board to the Successor

13 Agency of the former Inglewood Redevelopment Agency Directing the City of

14 Inglewood as the Successor Agency to former Inglewood Redevelopment Agency to

15 Implement the approved Long-Range Property Management Plan, as amended, with

16 respect to the Long-Term Use and Disposition of the LAX Noise Mitigation Properties,

17 B-1.1 through and including B-3, representing Parcels 1 through and including 13,

18 subject to the applicable Disposition Requirements of the Federal Aviation
19 Administration grant agreements and Los Angeles World Airports letter agreements."
20 The Oversight Board failed to inform the public that it was proposing to dispose of

21 properties pursuant to an agreement with extensive potential impacts on thousands of
22 Inglewood residents and businesses. The Oversight Board failed to inform the public of

23 any connection between the listed agenda item and the construction of a sports arena.

24 96. Thus, the agenda's description was overly vague, and the Oversight
25 Board's action was not adequately or accurately described on the agenda, in violation of

26 the Brown Act.

27

28

22
Printed on Recycled Paper VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BROWN ACT

1 97. The Oversight Board Agency further violated the Brown Act by not making

2 available the Federal Aviation Administration grant agreements and Los Angeles World

3 Airports letter agreements to the public.

4 98. Petitioner IRATE was prejudiced by this violation because it was denied
the opportunity to prepare and provide meaningful comments to the Oversight Board on

6 the implementation of the amended Long-Range Property Management Plan, the
7 applicable disposition requirements of the "Federal Aviation Administration grant

8 agreements and Los Angeles World Airports letter agreements," the disposition of

9 1 Parcels 1 through 13, and the interaction between the disposition of the properties and the
10 Arena Project or to ascertain the extent to which the implementation of thé Long-Range
11 Property Management Plan or requirements of the "Federal Aviation Administration

12 grant agreements and Los Angeles World Airports letter agreements" would affect the

13 interests of IRATE's members. For these reasons, the Oversight Board's action at its
14 June 27, 2018, including adoption of a resolution directing implementation of the
15 approved Long-Range Property Management Plan, as amended, with respect to the
16 disposition of Parcels through 13, must be declared null and void, pursuant to
17  Government Code section 54960.1(a).

18 99. On June 29, 2018, pursuant to Government Code section 54960.1(b),
19 IRATE timely submitted a demand to the Oversight Board to cure or correct the action
20 taken on June 27, 2018 in violation of the Brown Act. The Oversight Board did not
21 respond.

22 100. For the reasons stated above, the Successor Agency' action taken on June
23 19, 2018 and the Oversight Board's action taken on June 27, 2018 with respect to
24 LRPMP 1-13 must be declared null and void, pursuant to Government Code section
25 54960.1(a).

26 101. Without a writ of mandate and declaratory and injunctive relieve provided
27 for by the Brown Act, IRATE is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that it
28 and other interested persons, citizens, and taxpayers will be irreparably harmed because
23
Printed on Recycled Paper VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF E PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BROWN ACT

1 they will be denied notice of and the opportunity to participate in the Successor Agency's

2 and Oversight Board's meetings, a right guaranteed by law." Government Code Section

3 54960(a) provides that any interested person, such as IRATE, may commence an action

4 by mandamus, injunction, or declaratory relief for the purpose of stopping or preventing

5 violations or threatened violations of the Brown Act.

6 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

7 (Injunction Against Further Pursuit of the Land Transfer

8 Until Respondents Comply with CEQA and the Brown Act)

9 102. Petitioner incorporates herein and realleges the allegations in prior
10 paragraphs, as if fully set forth herein.
11 103. Respondents failed to comply with CEQA and the Brown Act prior to
12 taking actions to facilitate the Arena Project and the Land Transfer. Petitioner therefore
13 prays for a preliminary and permanent injunction against Respondents and any of their
14 agents from taking any further action to advance the Land Transfer and/or Arena Project

15 unless and until such time as Respondents comply with their mandatory duties under
16 CEQA, the Brown Act, and all other applicable environmental rules, regulations and
17 procedures.

18 104. Petitioner has no adequate remedy other than that prayed for herein in that
19 the subject matter is unique and monetary damages would therefore be inadequate to
20 fully compensate Petitioner for the consequences of Respondents' actions in their

21 continued failure to comply with CEQA and the Brown Act with respect to the Project

22 and the Land Transfer. Petitioner therefore seeks, and is entitled to, injunctive relief

23 under Code of Civil Procedure section 526 et seq., and to a stay, preliminary and/or
24 permanent injunction.

25 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

26 WHEREFORE, Petitioner and Plaintiff prays for relief as follows:

27 1. For a peremptory writ of mandate:

16 under CEQA and all other applicable environmental rules, regulations and procedures.
17 3. For a declaration that the Successor Agency actions of June 19, 2018,

21 including the adoption of a resolution directing the Successor Agency to implement the
22 long range property management plan are null and void due to the Board's violations of

24 5. For an award of its costs of suit and litigation expenses, including, without

Re: Challenge to June 27, 2018 Approval to Facilitate Land Transfer for

Re: Demand to Cure and Correct Brown Act Violation in Disposition of Properties by Oversight Board Resolution Adopted June 27, 2018
Dear Oversight Board Members:
These comments are provided on behalf of the Inglewood Residents Against Takings and Evictions (*IRATE") regarding the June 27, 2018 City of Inglewood Former Redevelopment Agency Oversight Board agenda. This action approved the disposition of 13 parcels of property that would be used for construction of the Clippers sports arena project.
We demand that you cease and desist in your continuing efforts to defeat the
public transparency purposes of the Brown Act, and that you rescind the disposition of property that the Oversight Board approved on June 27, 2018.

I. THE OVERSIGHT BOARD VIOLATED THE BROWN ACT.
The Oversight Board on June 27, 2018 acted to dispose properties that are included within an Exclusive Negotiating Agreement between the City of Inglewood, the Successor Agency, the Parking Authority and Murphy's Bowl LLC for a sports arena (the "Arena Project"). This meeting violated the Brown Act.
The Oversight Board failed to inform the public that it was proposing to dispose properties pursuant to an agreement with extensive potential impacts on hundreds of Inglewood residents and businesses. The brief description on the Oversight Board agenda for its June 27, 2018 meeting stated:

Inglewood Successor Agency Oversight Board
June 29, 2018
Page 2

Adoption of Resolution by the Oversight Board to the Successor Agency of the former Inglewood Redevelopment Agency Directing the City of Inglewood as the Successor Agency to former Inglewood Redevelopment Agency to Implement the approved Long-Range Property Management Plan, as amended, with respect to the Long-Term Use and Disposition of the LAX Noise Mitigation Properties, B. 1.1 through and including B-3, representing Parcels 1 through and including 13, subject to the applicable Disposition Requirements of the Federal Aviation Administration grant agreements and Los Angeles World Airports letter agreements. (Emphasis added.)
Contrary to Brown Act requirements, this description is overly vague and uninformative. It does not bother to inform the public that the property disposition actions are taken in furtherance of an Exclusive Negotiating Agreement (ENA) for the Clippers Arena and involving Murphy's Bowl LLC. It fails to inform the public that the parcels being transferred are specifically designated in maps in the ENA for construction of the arena project. This failure to adequately inform the public is consistent with and further evidence of the City of Inglewood's deliberate attempts to obfuscate the true nature of actions taken to facilitate the Clippers arena project. (See enclosure 1, Karen Foshay, "Documents Show How Inglewood Clippers Arena Deal Stayed Secret," KCET (Mar. 15, 2018), available at https://www.kcet.org/shows/socal-connected/documents- show-how-intlewood-clippers-arena-deal-stayed-secret; and enclosure 2, June 9, 2017 email between Clippers and City of Inglewood representatives stating "the entity [Murphy's Bowl LLC] will have a generic name so it won't identify the proposed project.")
The Oversight Board has clearly violated the letter and spirit of the Brown Act. The Arena Project is a big deal. The ENA is a big deal. The ENA and Arena Project will severely impact homes, small businesses and a church.
Once again, pursuant to Government Code section 54960.1, we hereby demand that the Oversight Board cure or correct its violations of the Brown Act within 30 days or we will consider all available options, including seeking judicial determination that the action taken violated the Brown Act and will seek reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in bringing such an action.

Il. CONCLUSION.

Public property dispositions cannot be approved without adequate notice and compliance with Brown Act requirements. The Oversight Board is again violating the Brown Act and has not complied with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), as explained in our letter to the Oversight Board dated June 27, 2018.

Manch 15,2018

Inglewood City
Inglewood city officials were secretly negotlating an agreement to buld an arena for the Clippers basketball team for months befote giving a carefully guarded e to the public, accolding to neny released documents.
Now there is a requieist for the Los Angeles Districi Attorney's Office to investigate.
Residents learned about the project on June 15, 2017 at a special meeting of the city counci. The documents suggest that backers of the arena may have purposely used a special meeting because it required fust 24 bowrs public notice, while a regular mecting requirés /2 hours notice. The meeting agenda didn't mentioh the arena or the Clippers, but géve an obscure fiame of a related company negotiating the deal.
Ajudge ordered the docuiments be made public carlier this month as part of ongoing litigation involving the city and a community group. The Inglewood Residents Againat Taking and Eviction, or IRATE, is suing Inglewood, claiming the city aid not tollow the California Environmnental Quality Act, or CEQA, before it approved the excusive negotiating agreement to build the prena.
On.Thureday, Doug Carstens, an environmental attorney representing IRATE sent a letter to the Los Angeles District Attorhey lackde Lacey askdng het office to investigate the city for intentional Brown Act violatione. The Brown Act is a state law guaranteeing the public'e right to attend meetings held by local legislative bodies.
"These actions are exactly contrary to the government openness and transparency purposes of the Brown Act and the California Environmental Quality Act," said Carstens.
The state's oldest environmental law, CEQA, requires local and state agencies to do environmental reviews before approving certain projects. An environmental impact report evaluating the arena is currently underway, according to city officials, Should the project be approved, some local business owners and residents have voiced concern the city may use eminent domain to acquire property to develop the arena.
Carstens sought documents, including emails, related to the agreement. The city had argued the emails were protected by attorney client privilege. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Amy Hogue partially disagreed and ordered attorneys defending Inglewood to release over 200 pages of draft agreements and emails Monday.
In an April 2017 email from Royce Jones, an attorney for Inglewood, to Chris Hunter, the attorney negotiating for the project, Jones confirms a draft of the agreement was prepared based on discussions earlier in the month with Mayor 3 James Butts and "certain other City and Clipper representatives."
IRATE contends that the documents show the secrecy was maintained Wegally.

In a June 9 email, Hunter asked Jones if the agreement must be part of the city council's public agenda or could be dowploaded "shortly before the meeting" because his client wanted to reach out to "various players." Jones responded that the agreement must be part of the agenda and "that is why we elected to just post 24 hours versus the normal 72 hours."

June 9 email between lawyens for Inglewood and the Clippers.
Hunter added that the entity he is representing "will have a generic name so it won't identify the proposed project." Regidents would see only that the meeting involved Murphy's Bowl LLC, an entity formed in January 2017 in Delaware. It has one member, Steven Ballmer, the owner of the Clippers, accoiding to court records.
The Inglewood City Council's regular meetings are held on alternate Tuesdays, but there wasn't one on Tuesday, June 13. Instead, there was a special meeting on Thursday, which only required the agenda to be posted 24 bours in advance.
The timing is more than suspect, Carstens believes.
"Each of these actions individually and collectively shows an ongoing and illegal pattern of gaming the system, depriving the public of notice, and hiding the ball,' said Carstens.
In the Mayor'a newsletters, Butts acknowledged negotiations with the Clippers began in January 2017.
Butte and City Attorney Ken Campos did not respond to1 request for comment.
The negotiations are characterized as "secret meetinge" in a lawsuit filed March 5 by the Madison Square Garden Co., which owns the Forum, MSG is suing the city of Inglewood including Butts, the city council and the parking authority, claiming they violated a contractual agreement involving a 15-acre parking lot. Inglewood leased the lot to MSG for seven years starting in 2014 to use for overflow parking.
MSG says in the laweuit that it invested $100 million into the Forum property based on agreements with the city, induding the parking lot lease. The lawsult also claims that in January 2017 the city pressured MSG to back out of the parking lease agreement and that the mayor claimed the city needed the land to create a "technology park."
Butts is at the center of what MSG calls a "fraudulent scheme" to let the Clippers use the land to build a facility that would compete with the Forum. The mayor told MSG officials use his personal email and not his official city account to communicate, according the complaint.
The Forum was acquired by MSG in 2012 and has been a venue for concerts and sporting events.
By early April MSG terminated the parking lease agreement. At the time, MSG did not know Inglewood officials were already well underway in drafting an agreement with the owners of the Clippers to sell them the parking lot in order to build an arena for the basketball team. MSG claims it would not have broken the lease had it known of the city's "true intentiobs.* The company learned about the plan on June 14 when Butts broke the news in a telephone call to an MSG executive, the same day the public agenda was posted.
