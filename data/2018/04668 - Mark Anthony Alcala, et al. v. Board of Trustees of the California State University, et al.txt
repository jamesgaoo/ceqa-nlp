1 INTRODUCTION

2 1.

3 By this Verified Petition (*Petition"), Petitioners Mark Anthony Alcala, Walter

A Rivers, and Northridge for the Environment and Equitable Development ("NEED") (collectively

5 "Petitioners") challenge the approval by the Board of Trustees of the California State University

6 ("CSU Board") and its member campus California State University Northridge ("CSUN")

7 (collectively "Respondents") in approving the hotel/restaurant project believed to be developed as

8 a public-private-partnership with Jupiter Realty Corporation ("Developer" or "Real Party").

9 Specifically, on July 24, 2018, the CSU Board approved a revision to the CSUN Campus Master

10 Plan and adopted a mitigated negative declaration ("MND") (collectively "Approvals") in

11 furtherance of the demolishion of an existing restaurant and the construction/maintenance of a

12 new resturant, 150-room hotel, 135-vehicle surface parking lot, and other related improvements

13 totaling approximatly 183,000 square feet ("sf.") of development ("Project") on a 2.75-acre site
on the CSUN campus located in the City of Los Angeles ("Site").

14 2.

15 Petitioners allege that the Approvals for the Project violated the California

16 Environmental Quality Act, Pub. Res. Code 21000 et seq., ("CEQA"). Specifically, as set forth

17 in the First Cause of Action herein, Respondents used an MND in lieu of a more comprehensive

18 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"), despite expert comments establishing a fair argument that

19 the Project poses various significant environmental impacts including but not limited to air

20 quality and greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions. As set forth in the Second Cause of Action,

21 Respondents failed to analyze all potentially significant environmental impacts. Finally, as set

22 forth in the Third Cause of Action, Respondents failed to consider adoption of additional feasible

23 mitigation measures that would further reduce potential environmental impacts.

JURISDICTION

24 3.

25 This Court has jurisdiction under Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168 or 21168.5 and Code

26 Civ. Proc §§ 1085 or 1094.5. The parties and the Project Site are located in Los Angeles County.

27 The within action has been timely brought within 90 days of the Project Approval per Gov. Code

28 65009, and timely brought within 30 days of the July 25, 2018 posting of the CEQA Notice of

(:) (

Determination for the Project per Pub. Res. Code § 21167. Petitioners served a Notice of Intent

2 to file this Petition on Respondents pursuant to Pub. Res. Code § 21167.5 by mail on August 22,

3 2018 as reflected in Exhibit A attached hereto. Concurrent with the filing of this action,

4 Petitioners have notified the Attorney General of the State of California of the filing of this

5 Petition in .accordance with Pub. Res. Code § 21167.7.

6 4. As alleged herein, the violations by Respondents have affected the beneficial

7 interests of Petitioners and/or their supporting members, as well as enforcement of important

8 rights affecting the public interest. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a

9 substantial benefit on the public, including citizens, residents, businesses and taxpayers affected

10 by CSUN, and will result in the enforcement of important public rights by requiring Respondents

11 and Real Party to comply with CEQA and other legal requirements applicable to the proposed

12 Project.

13 5. Petitioners have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy under ordinary law unless

14 this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside the Project

15 Approvals and prohibiting Respondents and Real Party from taking further actions concerning the

16 Project until it has complied with those legal requirements. In the absence of such remedies,

17 Respondents' decisions will remain in effect in violation of state law and injurious to Petitioners.

18 The relief sought by way of this Petition will redress the likelihood of future injury and

19 interference with Petitioners' beneficial interests, their supporting members, and the public's

20 interest in having the law duly followed.

21 PARTIES

22 6. Petitioners Walter Rivers and Mark Anthony Alcala are individuals and residents

23 of the City of Los Angeles and have a beneficial interest and will be impacted by the matters set

24 forth in this Petition. Their interests, and the public interest, will be directly affected by the

25 Project and Respondents' failure to comply with the requirements of CEQA in connection with

26 the Project. Mr. Rivers and Mr. Alcala live nearby and frequent the vicinity of the Site and will

27

1 be affected by negative Project impacts including but not limited to air quality, GHG, and other

2 CEQA deficiencies.

3 7. Petitioner NEED is an unincorporated association operating under a designated
4 name by which it is known whose members include affected individuals including Petitioners
Rivers and Alcala who have a beneficial interest in the matters set forth in this Petition including

6 being affected by the negative impacts of the Project. Petitioner's mission is to ensure

7 responsible development in Los Angeles, particularly the Northridge area, and informed

8 decisionmaking by public officials and state agencies with regard to projects that may cause
significant impacts to the environment in the City of Los Angeles. NEED was formed after the

10 date of Project Approval pursuant to Pub. Res. Code § 21167(c).

11 8. Petitioners, individually and through their members, objected to the Project

12 Approvals orally and/or in writing before the close of the public hearing on the Project.

13 Petitioners have exhausted all administrative remedies in that the determinations by the

14 Respondents are final and no further administrative appeal procedures are provided by State or

15 local law. All issues submitted for judicial review in this Petition were sufficiently raised and

16 disputed with Respondents before the final approval of the Project. Respondents were given

17 notice and the opportunity to act in compliance with CEQA but failed to do so. It is well-

18 established that any party who participates in the administrative process can assert all factual and

19 legal issues raised by any commenting party, official or agency. Citizens for Open Government v.

20 City of Lodi (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 865, 875.

21 9. Respondent Board of Trustees of the California State University ("CSU Board") is

22 the governing body of the California State University ("CSU") system, a public institution of

23 higher education established by the California Legislature in 1960 to offer undergraduate,

24 graduate and professional instruction at its member campuses. Ed. Code § 66010.4(b); City of

- 10. Respondent California State-University Northridge ("CSUN") is a member of the

2 CSU system and served as the lead agency during the Project's CEQA review, including the

3 preparation and circulation of the Project's initial study, MND, response to comments received,

4 as well as the initial determinations regarding the Project's impact on the environment.
5 11. Real Party in Interest Jupiter Realty Corporation ("Developer" or "Real Party") is
1O believed to be an Illinois corporation selected by CSUN to develop the Project via a public-
private-partnership and, therefore, Real Party will be the ultimate recipient of the Project
Approval.

9 12. The true names, capacities, corporate, associate or otherwise of Respondents and

10 Real Parties named herein as DOES 1 through 10, inclusive, are unknown to Petitioners who,

11 therefore, sue said Respondents and Real Parties by fictitious names. Petitioners will amend this

12 Petition to show the true names and capacities when they have been ascertained.

13 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

14 13. THE SITE: The Project Site lies within an eight-acre, square-lot known as the

15 "Orange Grove" located at the southeast corner of the CSUN campus that fronts the northern side

16 of Nordhoff Street between Lindley Avenue and Matador Drive. The Orange Grove is a remnant

17 of the San Fernando Valley's agricultural heritage that includes a duck/turtle pond, observatory,

18 and numerous Sycamore, Citrus, and other trees. Under the CSUN Master Plan, the vast majority

19 of the Orange Grove is designated as "Character-Defining Open Space" to be maintained,

20 revitalized, and integrate into the daily life of students, faculty, staff and campus visitors. At the

21 northeastern corner of the Orange Grove fronting the southern side of Dearborn Street, an

22 approximate one-acre square-lot is designated for "Auxiliary Campus Services". The southern

23 section of this one-acre lot is currently occupied with a single-story, 6,500 sf. restaurant known as

24 the "University Club" and/or "Orange Grove Bistro". The 2.75 Project Site captures the entire

25 one-acre Auxiliary Campus Service area and extends south into the Orange Grove nearly to

26 Nordhoff Street.

1 14. THE PROJECT: The Project entails a revision to the CSUN Master Plan to allow

2 the demolition of the University Club and construction of a new restaurant and hotel to be

3 developed as a public-private-partnership. Construction will take approximately two years to

4 complete and chiefly include:

5 On the northern portion of the Project Site currently occupied by the Orange Grove

6 trees, a 135-vehicle, 60,000 sf. surface parking lot;

7 Immediately south of the parking lot and replacing the University Club, a single-

8 story (30-foot tall), 13,000 sf. restaurant including a bar and private dining area;
9 and

10 - Immediately south of the new restaurant and extending towards Nordhoff Street, a

11 six-story (70-foot tall), 150-room hotel with 110,000 sf. of floor area including a

12 conference room, fitness center, pool, and other hotel amenities.

13 15. ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW & PROJECT APPROVAL: In May 2017, CSUN signed

14 a Letter of Intent ("LOI') with Real Party to develop the Project pursuant to a public-private-

15 partnership with the expectation that construction would commence in early-2018 and be

16 completed in late-2019.

17 16. Between March and April 2018, CSUN raised serious concerns regarding

18 Developer's compliance with the LOI as to Real Party's ability to secure viable equity partners

19 and timely construct the Project.

20 17. On April 26, 2018, CSUN released a Notice of Intent to adopt the Project's MND.

21 18. On May 25, 2018, Mr. Rivers submitted a joint letter commenting on the MND's

22 analysis that included concerns regarding the impacts to the Orange Grove, delays in

23 construction, and potential GHG impacts; which CSUN responded to on Or around July 12, 2018.

24 19. On July 23, 2018, Mr. Rivers submitted a joint letter containing supplemental

25 comments, including expert analysis from environmental consultants regarding air quality and

26 GHG impacts, as well as other CEQA considerations such as the development on character

27 defining open space; which CSUN responded to the following day,

20. On July 24, 2018, Mr. Alcala and others spoke during the CSU Board meeting
where concerns were raised regarding Real Party's ability to deliver the Project without missing
further deadlines, as well as mitigating any risks associated with the Project. Nevertheless, the
4 CSU Board adopted the MND and approved the Project with Respondents filing with the State

5 Clearinghouse a CEQA Notice of Determination for the Project the following day,

6 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

7 FAILURE TO PREPARE AN EIR

8 (WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS - CODE CIV. PRO. $ 1094.5 - CEQA VIOLATIONS)
9 21. Petitioners restate and reallege Paragraphs 1-20, as if fully set forth herein,

10 22. CEQA has a strong presumption in favor of requiring preparation of an EIR. This

11 presumption is reflected in what is known as the "fair argument" standard, under which an agency
12 must prepare an EIR whenever substantial evidence in the record supports a fair argument that a

13 project may have a significant effect on the environment. Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n v.
14 Regents of the Univ. of Cal. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 1112, 1123; No Oil. Inc, v. City of Los Angeles

15 (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75. A lead agency must prepare an EIR if a project may cause significant

16 effects on the environment, even if the project is beneficial. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21100, 21151 and

17 14 Cal. Code Regs. ("CEQA Guidelines") § 15063(b)(1).

18 23. The fair argument test is a "low threshold" where a project "may" have a

19 significant effect on the is environment if there is a "reasonable probability" that it will result in a

20 significant impact. No Oil, Inc, 13 Cal.3d at 83-84 n. 16. Substantial evidence is enough relevant

21 information and reasonable inference that a fair argument can be made to support a conclusion,

22 even though other conclusions. CEQA Guidelines § 15384(a). Substantial evidence includes

23 facts, reasonable assumptions predicated on facts, and expert opinions supported by facts. Pub.

24 Res. Code §§ 21080(e), 21082.2(c); CEQA Guidelines § § 15064(f)(5), 15384.

25 24. An agency must prepare an EIR whenever it can be fairly argued by substantial

26 evidence that a project may have a significant environmental impact. If there is substantial

27 evidence both for and against preparing an EIR, then the agency must prepare the EIR. Here, as

28 -7-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

( (O

P fully set forth in the comments submitted by Petitioners and other commenting agencies and/or

2 parties, Respondents were presented with substantial evidence - including expert opinion

3 testimony - • demonstrating that the Project's MND was flawed and failed to fully disclose and

4 analyze potential impacts on air quality, GHG emissions, impacts to character defining open
space, and an unrealistic construction timeline that avoids more demanding GHG reduction
mitigation measures to reduce the Project's mobile/operational emissions. Multiple commenters
informed Respondents that there was a fair argument contrary to the MND's CEQA findings, and
requested a more thorough Project-specific EIR.
25. Here, Respondents failed to acknowledge that there was a fair argument of
10 potentially significant impacts despite being confronted with credible opinions on all of these

11 issues. Respondents should have prepared an EIR. Any one of the impacts listed above would
lead to the requirement that an EIR was to be prepared. The Respondents' refusal to prepare an 12

13 EIR was not based on substantial evidence and was a failure to proceed according to the law.

14 Accordingly, Respondents should have circulated an EIR for the Project.

15 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

16 FAILURE TO ANALYZE ALL POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS: FINDINGS NOT BASED ON

17 SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE (CEQA, PUB. RES. CODE $ 21000 ET SEQ.)

18 26. Petitioners restate and reallege Paragraphs 1-25, as if fully set forth herein.

19 27. CEQA requires that a lead agency identify all potentially significant impacts of a

20 project. It further requires that the lead agency's findings must be based on substantial evidence.

21 Pub. Res. Code § 21082.2.

22 28. Respondents failed to identify a number of potentially significant impacts as to air

23 quality, GHG emissions, character defining open space, and relied upon unrealistic construction

24 timelines. Its findings that these impacts were not significant, and that they were mitigated to a

25 less than significant level, were not based on substantial evidence.

N 60 7 10 10 FAILURE TO MITIGATE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS; FINDINGS NOT BASED ON SUBSTANTIAL
EVIDENCE (CEQA, PUB. RES. CODE $ 21000 ET SEO.)

29. Petitioners restate and reallege Paragraphs 1-28, as if fully set forth herein.
30. CEQA requires an agency to adopt feasible mitigation measures that will
substantially lessen or avoid the project's potentially significant impacts and to describe those
A mitigation measures in the CEQA review document. Pub. Res. Code § 21081.6(b), This

upon a 8 obligation is particularly important in the case of an MND as it depends for its it existence

9 finding of no significant impacts.

10 31. A lead agency must impose all feasible mitigation measures to reduce impacts to

11 less than significant levels.

12 32. The MND failed to identify potential significant impacts discussed above and,

13 therefore, waived any consideration to adopt additional feasible mitigation measures that would

14 further reduce potential impacts. For example, Respondents failed to prepare a health risk

15 assessment to identify air quality impacts and feasible mitigation measures. Similarly, the

16 Respondents failed to incorporate GHG mitigation measures advanced under the California Air

17 Resources Board's 2017 Scoping Plan or CSUN's Climate Action Plan. Respondents' failure to

18 consider and adopt these measures represented : failure to proceed by law in violation of CEQA.

21 1. That the Court enters a peremptory writ of mandate ordering Respondents to set

22 aside and void the Project Approvals, pending its full compliance with CEQA including

2. For a judgement enforcing the duty imposed upon Respondents by CEQA to prepare an EIR adequately addressing potential individual and cumulative impacts to the environment in any subsequent action taken regarding the Project.
3. For a judgement enforcing the duty imposed upon Respondents by CEQA to adequately consider mitigation to reduce significant impacts in any subsequent action taken regarding the Project.
4. That the Court issue a temporary stay, stay, temporary restraining order, and/or an injunction ordering the Respondents, Real Party, their agents and successors to refrain from proceeding with the Project and issuing further permits while this Petition is pending.
