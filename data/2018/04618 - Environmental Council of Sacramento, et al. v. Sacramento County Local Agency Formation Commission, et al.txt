- g (Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)
50. 13 Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference Paragraphs 1 through 49, inclusive,
of this Petition, as if fully set forth below. 14
51. Respondents committed : prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in a 15 manner required by law by relying on an EIR that fails to meet the requirements of CEQA for 16 disclosure, analysis, and/or mitigation of significant project impacts. 17
52. Respondents' Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations violate 18 the requirements of the CEQA Guidelines. The Findings fail to identify the changes or 19 alterations that are required to avoid or substantially lessen the project's significant 20 environmental effects (Guidelines § 15091(a)(1); the Findings and Statement of Overriding 21 Considerations are not supported by substantial evidence (Guidelines, § 15091(b)).
22
53. The EIR fails to comply with the requirements of CEQA in that it fails to 23 adequately disclose, analyze and/or mitigate the Project's environmental impacts and cumulative 24 impacts as required by law, and its conclusions regarding the Project's environmental impacts 25
are not supported by substantial evidence.
26
a. EIR fails to adequately address, analyze and discuss the uncertainty of the 27 water supply or analyze alternative plans for water. (See Vineyard Area Citizens for 28 Responsible Growth, Inc. v. City of Rancho Cordova (2007) 40 Cal.4th 412, 432 ("Vineyard")
12 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 ("where ...it is impossible to confidently determine that anticipated future water sources will
2 be available, CEQA requires some discussion of possible replacement sources").)
O  p W b. The EIR failed to adequately discuss, analyze and mitigate the Project's
impacts to the Sandhill Crane, which is listed as threatened under the California Endangered
Species Act and is a California Fully Protected Species. For example, the Final EIR incorrectly
calculates the amount of unflooded foraging habitat available to Sandhill Crane. Additionally,
n Mitigation Measure 3.4-4 fails to adequately mitigate the impact to very rare upland forage
g habitat for Sandhill Cranes near their population stronghold.

9 C. The EIR failed to adequately discuss, analyze and mitigate the Project's
10 impacts to the Swainson's Hawk. For example, Mitigation Measure 3.4-2c mandates a

11 fragmented, project by project mitigation of lost foraging habitat in the SOLA Area, allowing
12 unknown, multiple conservation operators, locations to be determined, uncertain number of

13 mitigation acres, and lack of performance criteria.

14 d. The EIR failed to adequately discuss, analyze and mitigate the Project's
15 impacts to the Giant Garter Snake.

16 e. The EIR failed to adequately discuss, analyze and mitigate the Project's
17 impacts to biological resources, including implementation of the South Sacramento Habitat

18 Conservation Plan ("SSHCP"). The Project will interfere with a conflict with the

19 implementation of SSHCP.

20 f. The EIR fails to mitigate for loss of farmland of local importance. Impact
21 3.2.1 fails to recognize the loss of locally important farmland as an impact and fails to

22 acknowledge the Sacramento County General Plan's policies for agricultural preservation. The

23 EIR also fails to disclose and discuss prime ag land as defined by Cortese-Knox-Hertzberger.

24 (See Gov't Code, § 56064.)

25 h. The EIR fails to adequately address, analyze and mitigate the Project's

26 cumulative impacts biological resources, particularly to Sandhill Crane and Swainson's Hawk.

27 54. The Final EIR improperly relies upon deferred mitigation measures without

28 adequate performance standards. CBQA Guidelines, section 15126.4(a) requires that "mitigation

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE , 13

F measures must be fully enforceable through permit conditions, agreements, or other legally-
2 binding instruments." CEQA "permits a lead agency to defer specifically detailing mitigation
0 710 0 measures as along as the lead agency commits itself to mitigation and to specific performance
standards." (Gray v. County of Madera (2008) 167 Cal.App.4h 1099, 1118; see also
Communities for a Better Environment v. City of Richmond (2010) 184 Cal.App.4t 70, 94;
Sacramento Old City Association v. City Council (1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 1011, 1028-1029.) For
7 example, the Final EIR lacks performance standard for mitigation of impacts on wildlife (see
8 MM 3.4-2c) and agriculture (see MM 3.2.2).

9 55. The EIR fails to comply with the requirements of CEQA in that it fails to

10 adequately disclose, analyze and/or mitigate the Project's environmental impacts as required by

11 law. and its conclusions regarding the Project's environmental impacts are not supported by
12 substantial evidence.

13 56. Based upon each of the foregoing reasons, the EIR is legally defective under
14 CEQA. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion in violation of CEQA in approving

15 the Project. As such, the Court should issue a writ of mandate directing Respondents to set

16 aside the certification of the EIR and approval of the Project.

17 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
(Violation of the Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Local Government 18 Reorganization Act of 2000, Government Code, section 56000)
19 57. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference Paragraphs 1 through 58,
20 inclusive, of this Petition, as if fully set forth below.
21 58. LAFCO's approval of the Kammerer/99 SOIA application is inconsistent with
22 LAFCO's obligation under LAFCO's governing legislation.
23 59. In enacting LAFCO's governing legislation, the Legislature recognized the
24 importance of promoting orderly development and in balancing development with the
25 sometimes competing state interests of discouraging sprawl, preserving open space and prime
26 agricultural lands; and efficiently extending government services. (Gov't Code $56001.)
27 LAFCO's goal is to encourage the formation and related extension of governmental agencies
28 and to prevent duplication of services. (See San Bernardino Water Valley Conservation
14 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

District Vv. Local Agency Formation Commission (2009) 173 CA4th 190, 194; Friends of Mt.

2 Diablo v. County of Contra Costa (1977) 72 CA3d 1006, 1011; Del Paso Recreation & Park
au A 0) District v. Board of Supervisors (1973) 33 CA3d 483,490; City of Ceres v. City of Modesto
(1969) 274 CA2d 545,554.) "Among the purposes of a commission are discouraging urban
sprawl, preserving open-space and prime agricultural lands, encouraging the efficient provision
of government services, and encouraging the orderly formation and development of local
0 c agencies based upon local conditions and circumstances." (Gov't Code, § 56301.)
60. The Project is inconsistent with LAFCO General Policy H-1, Policy V (Specific

9 Standards) I-5 and I-9; Policy III (General Standards) 7. Respondents' determination that the

10 Project is consistent with the foregoing policies is speculative and unsupported by substantial

11 evidence.

12 61. In reviewing applications that could reasonably be expected to induce, facilitate, or
13 lead to the conversion of existing open-space lands to uses other than open-space uses, LAFCO

14 must consider all of the following policies and priorities:

15 (a) Development or use of land for other than open-space uses shall be guided

16 away from existing prime agricultural lands in open-space use toward areas containing

17 nonprime agricultural lands, unless that action would not promote the planned, orderly, efficient
18 development of an area.

19 (b) Development of existing vacant or nonprime agricultural lands for urban uses

20 within the existing jurisdiction of a local agency or within the sphere of influence of a local

21 agency should be encouraged before any proposal is approved which would allow for or lead to

22 the development of existing open-space lands for non-open-space uses which are outside of the

23 existing jurisdiction of the local agency or outside of the existing sphere of influence of the

24 local agency. (Gov't Code, § 56377.)

25 62. The record demonstrates that ample empty/vacant land exists within Elk Grove and

26 the County's Urban Service Boundary. This empty/vacant will serve any development needs in

27 the area for many years. LAFCO's governing legislation states that LAFCO should guide

28 development away from the land that is the subject of the application. (Gov't Code, § 56377.)

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 15

RN 0 tON :0 Additionally, the legislation provides that LAFCO should not approve an application for
boundary changes when there is vacant or nonprime agricultural lands available for urban uses
within the existing jurisdiction. (Id.) Thus, Respondents failed to demonstrate the need for SOI
expansion as thousands of acres of undeveloped vacant land exists within the City of Elk
Grove's limits available for new construction.

63. The Project conflicts with the regional infrastructure planning that has taken place.

a. By letter dated March 6, 2017, the Sacramento County Water Agency
("SCWA") informed Respondents that additional surface water and groundwater supplies

9 would have to be obtained and that service from SCWA would require additional infrastructure

10 that includes groundwater treatment plant, groundwater storage, water wells, and transmission

11 and distribution mains.

12 b. By letter dated March 20, 2017, the County of Sacramento informed the
13 Respondents that the Project requires an amendment to the County's Urban Service Boundary if

14 the land is not annexed into the City of Elk Grove. Amendment of the Urban Service Boundary

15 would require an amendment to the County's General Plan. If the property is annexed to the

16 City, then the City's General Plan would have to be amended.

17 C. By letter dated August 25, 2017, the Sacramento Area Council of

18 Governments stated that the Project is inconsistent with SACOG's Metropolitan Transportation

19 Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy (MTP/SCS) and Blueprint. The MTP/SCS is based

20 upon the most likely land use pattern over a 20 plus year planning period. This forecast is based

21 upon general plans, specific plans, local policies and regulations. The MTP/SCS is based on

22 principles of smart growth and governs regional infrastructure investment, including federal

23 transportation funds.

24 64. Respondents fails to use the Cortese-Knox-Hertzberger definition of prime

25 agricultural land in its analysis and findings about impacts of the Project on prime agricultural

26 lands. (See Gov't Code, § 56064.) Under Cortese-Knox-Hertzberger, "Prime agricultural land

27 means an area of land, whether a single parcel or contiguous parcels, that has not been

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 16

M developed for a use other than an agricultural use and that meets any of the following
2 qualifications:
oNauAu (a) Land that qualifies, if irrigated, for rating as class I or class II in the use capability USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service land
classification, whether or not land is actually irrigated, provided that irrigation is feasible.

(b) Land that qualifies for rating 80 through 100 Storie Index Rating.
(c) Land that supports livestock used for the production of food and fiber and that has an annual carrying capacity equivalent to at least one animal unit per acre as defined by the United States Department of Agriculture in
025999 the National Range and Pasture Handbook, Revision 1, December 2003.
(d) Land planted with fruit or nut-bearing trees, vines, bushes, or crops that have a nonbearing period of less than five years and that will return during the commercial bearing period on an annual basis from the production of unprocessed agricultural plant production not less than four hundred dollars ($400) per acre.
(e) Land that has returned from the production of unprocessed agricultural 14 plant products an annual gross value of not less than four hundred dollars
15 ($400) per acre for three of the previous five calendar years.
65. The Cortese Knox definition of prime ag land refers to soil types and specifically 16

17 does not include irrigation as a component in determining whether land is classified as prime

18 agricultural land

66. Respondents' Final EIR's assessment of the agricultural lands relies upon the 19

20 California Department of Conservation mapping and makes no reference to the Cortese-Knox-
21 Hertzberger definition of prime agricultural land. The Final EIR states:
22 According to the Sacramento County Important Farmland map, published 18 EG by the California Division of Land Resource Protection (DOC 2014c), approximately 105 acres of land within the SOIA Area is designated as Prime Farmland, 405 acres of land within the SOIA Area is designated as Farmland of Statewide Importance, and approximately 627 acres of land is
designated as Farmland of Local Importance (Exhibit 3.2-1). In addition, active agricultural fields are located surrounding the project site are 26 designated as Prime Farmland, Farmland of Statewide Importance, and Farmland of Local Importance." (Final EIR at p. 3.2-3 (Agricultural 27 Resources).)

28

17 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

67.

üPWN Respondents approval of the Project did not properly rely upon the Cortese-Knox-
Hertzberger definition for prime ag land.

68. Based upon each of the foregoing reasons, the EIR is legally defective under
CEQA. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion in violation of CEQA in approving
the Project. As such, the Court should issue a writ of mandate directing Respondents to set
aside the certification of the EIR and approval of the Project.

7 69. Based upon each of the foregoing

8 sons, Respondents approval of the Project is

9 legally defective under Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg. Respondents prejudicially abused their

10 discretion in violation of Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg in approving the Project. As such, the Court

11 should issue a writ of mandate directing Respondents to set aside approval of the Project.

THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

12 (Violation of the Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Local Government

13 Reorganization Act of 2000, Government Code, section 56000)

70.
14 Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference Paragraphs 1 through 69,

15 inclusive, of this Petition, as if fully set forth below.

71.
16 LAFCo lacks the statutorily required policies to review SOI Applications.

17 Government Code Section 56300 states that "(a) It is the intent or the Legislature that each

18 commission, not later than January 1, 2002, shall establish written policies and procedures and

19 exercise its powers pursuant to this part in a manner consistent with those policies and

20 procedures and that encourages and provides planned well-ordered, efficient urban development

21 patterns with appropriate consideration of preserving open-space and agricultural lands within
those patterns."
22 72.
23 Sacramento County LAFCo has never adopted policies and procedures to address

24 how it will consider Sphere or Influence applications consistent with the statutory charges

25 described above. (Gov't Code §§56301 and $56377).

73.
26 The Draft EIR acknowledges that LAFCo has the statutorily required polices and

27 procedures for annexations but fails to acknowledge that the Sphere or Influence application is

28 being considered in the absence of statutorily required policies to implement the statute re
standards and policies for SOI approvals.

procedures for SOI consideration (Government Code sections 56301,56377), Respondents are in

would involve planning city's future boundary to encompass what is now unincorporated open
