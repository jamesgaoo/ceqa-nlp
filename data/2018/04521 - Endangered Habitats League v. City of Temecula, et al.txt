PETITIONER'S NOTICE TO ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CEQA PETITION

Specific Plan project ("the Project"). The Petition For Writ of Mandate is transmitted

2 herewith.

3 The Project concerns the development of a primarily residential project involving
4 up to 1,750 residential units in the City of Temecula. The Final Environmental Impact
5 Report ("EIR") fails to comply with CEQA in a number of meaningful ways including

6 that there is insufficient support and mitigation for significant biological impacts to
7 sensitive and protected species, habitats and wildlife corridors. In particular, the

8 Project's "South Parcel" adversely affects designated wildlife corridors that are essential
9 for maintaining a regional wildlife movement network in southern California.
10 For these and the other reasons alleged in the attached Verified Petition for
11 Peremptory Writ of Mandate, the decision approving the Project must be overturned.

22 CASE DESIGNATION: CEQA

23 INTRODUCTION

24

25 1. This action challenges the approval by Respondent, City of Temecula ("City"),
On or about December 12, 2017, of the Altair

26 certification of a Final Specific Plan project, including
Environmental Impact Report (SCH No. 2014111029), approval of a General Plan Amendment, and all related land use and t

27

28 development approvals (collectively, "the Project"). 8084

-|- VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

2. The Altair Specific Plan Project concerns the development of 270 acres of land

2 in the City of Temecula. The Project will construct up to 1,750 residential units
3 of varying types as well as limited commercial and civic uses. The Project
4 includes development of the so-called "South Parcel". The South Parcel

5 contains high value biological resources and habitat, including a critical corridor

6 for wildlife movement. By developing the South Parcel, the Project adversely
7 impacts these resources by reducing the size of the wildlife corridor and by
8 introducing human activity into natural wildlife habitat. Additionally, the
9 Project conflicts with the Western Riverside Multiple Species Habitat
10 Conservation Plan ("MSHCP") because the Project fails to meet MSHCP
11 conservation goals; but, the Project fails to resolve those conflicts by way of a
12 "Criteria Refinement" as required by the MSHCP. For these and other reasons,
13 the City's approval of the Project violates the California Environmental Quality
14 ("CEQA") (Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.).
15 3. During the Project's administrative review process, numerous interested parties
16 notified the City that there was need for further analysis and mitigation due to
17 the Project's adverse environmental effects in particular with respect to the
18 controversial "South Parcel" site. In spite of these reasoned comments in the
19 record, the City approved the Project and certified the Final EIR.

20 4. By this verified petition, Petitioner alleges the following:
21 PARTIES

22 S. Petitioner, ENDANGERED HABITATS LEAGUE, is a 501(c)3 non-profit
23 corporation dedicated to ecosystem protection in southern California. Members
24 of EHL submitted comments opposing approval of the Project.
25 6. Respondent, CITY OF TEMECULA, is a political subdivision of the State of
26 California. The City is a local governmental agency charged with the authority
27 of regulating and administering local land use and development within its
28

-2-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 territory in compliance with the provisions of its general plan and zoning

3 ordinances as well as applicable provisions of State law, including CEQA. The

4 City is the lead agency for the Project and is therefore charged with the duty of

5 ensuring compliance with applicable State and local laws.

6 7. Real Party in Interest, AMBIENT COMMUNITIES, LLC, was the applicant for

7 the Project, has an ownership interest in the property, and/or claims an interest in

8 the Project approvals at the subject of this lawsuit.

9 8. DOES 1 through 100 are individuals or entities that may have an ownership

10 interest in the property, were project applicants, or claim an interest in the

11 approvals at the subject of this lawsuit. Petitioner is unaware of the true names

12 or capacities of the Real Parties in Interest identified herein under the fictitious
names DOES through 100 inclusive.
13 STATEMENT OF FACTS

14 The Project

15

16 9. The Altair Specific Plan project is a proposal for the development of 270 acres

17 west and adjacent to Old Town and Murrieta Creek in the City of Temecula.

18 The Project entails development of primarily residential uses with some mixed

19 use as well as civic uses and open space. A total of 1,750 new, multi-family and

20 detached housing units will be constructed as part of the Project. Densities range

21 from 4 to 33 dwelling units per net acre. The Project will be constructed in four

22 phases and divided into neighborhoods or "villages."

23 10. The Project site is comprised of two portions: a main site consisting of 215 acres

24 a and a non-contiguous, 55-acre site to the south (the so-called "South Parcel").

25 11. Under the Specific Plan's land use/zoning map, the South Parcel is designated as

26 "Civic" (C). According to the Draft EIR, this land use designation can include a

27 variety of civic or institutional uses such as an educational facility for up to

28 5,000 students, an "office/research" campus, a convention center, a hospital

-3-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 and/or a cultural center. According to the Draft EIR, a maximum of 450,000

2 square feet of development is permitted in the South Parcel area with buildings
3 up to five stories. The Draft EIR states that Project design features would
4 "buffer" the Project from "possible wildlife features" in the environmentally

5 sensitive South Parcel area.

6 12. The Final EIR describes and analyzes purported revisions to the land uses of the
7 South Parcel. The Final EIR states that the Specific Plan land use plan was

8 revised based on comments to propose a "Nature/Cultural/Sustainability" (NCS)
9 use on the South Parcel, thereby replacing the more intense Civic/institutional
10 uses. The Final EIR states that the new land use includes a "Nature Center," two

11 parking lots, trails, bicycle paths, and park and recreational facilities on the

12 South Parcel.

13 13. In addition to certification of the Final EIR, the Project includes the following
14 approvals:

15 a) General Plan Amendment (PA14-0158) to change the land use
16 designations on the Project site from Industrial Park (IP), Open Space
17 (OS), Medium Density Residential (M), High Density Residential (H),
18 and Hillside Residential (HR) to Specific Plan Implementation (SPI) as
19 well as to revise the alignment of the Western Bypass Corridor.
20 b) Specific Plan (PA14-0159) setting forth the standards and regulations that
21 will govern the development of the entire Project area.
22 c) Tentative Tract Map (PAI4-0160) and,
23 d) Development Agreement (PA14-0161).
24 14. The Project also includes off-site improvements including construction of a
25 Western Bypass bridge over Murrieta Creek. The "Western Bypass" will
26 connect with larger transportation improvements underway namely a freeway
27 interchange at Highway 79/Temecula Parkway and Interstate 15.
28

-4-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 15. The Project site is subject to the Western Riverside Multiple Species
2 Conservation Plan ("MSHCP"). The MSHCP is a comprehensive habitat species
3 protection plan of which the City is a signatory. The MSHCP aims to protect
4 146 native species of plants and animals through the reserve and assembly of

5 500,000 acres of native habitat including "criteria" and "linkage" areas. The

6 MSHCP is administered by the Western Riverside County Regional

7 Conservation Authority ("RCA").

8 16. The Project site lies within the MSHCP's Linkage 10, Constrained Linkage 13,
9 and is adjacent to Constrained Linkage 4. These important linkages connect the
10 Santa Rosa Plateau Ecological Reserve to the east with the Santa Margarita
11 Ecological Reserve and the greater Santa Ana-Palomar Linkages to the west.
12 The Santa Ana-Palomar Linkage is critical for sustaining a regional wildlife
13 network.

14 CEQA Review and Project Approval
15 17. Pursuant to CEQA, the City published a Notice of Preparation (NOP) of Draft
16 Environmental Impact Report for the Project on November 5, 2014.

17 18. The Draft EIR was circulated for public comment on May 2, 2016.
18 19. The Final EIR was completed on or about October 17, 2017. The Final EIR
19 includes Appendix A, which contains changes to the description and analysis of
20 the Project's South Parcel. Appendix A purports to describe that the land use
21 designation and/or intended land uses of the South Parcel has been revised from

22 "Civic" to "Nature Center" or "NCS".

23 20. On November 15, 2017, the City of Temecula Planning Commission held a
24 public hearing on the Project and voted to recommend certification of the Final
25 EIR and approval of the Project to the City of Temecula City Council.
26 21. On December 12, 2017, the City of Temecula City Council voted to approve the
27 Project including certification of the Final EIR.
28

-5-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 22. On December 13, 2017, the City filed and posted the Notice of Determination
2 pursuant to CEQA.

3 23. The City's approval of the Project will cause Petitioner irreparable injury
4 for which Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law. Petitioner and its members

5 will be irreparably harmed by the City's actions in approving the Project.

6 Petitioner was harmed by, among other things, the failure of the City in its
7 certification of the EIR to adequately evaluate the potential impacts of the

8 Project, and the City's approval of the Project without providing adequate and
9 effective mitigation measures contrary to the requirements of State law.
10 24. The maintenance of this action is for the purpose of enforcing important public
11 policies of the State of California with respect to the protection of the
12 environment under CEQA and conformance with state law and local law. The
13 maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a substantial benefit upon
14 the public by protecting the public from environmental and other harms alleged
15 in this Petition. Petitioner is acting as a private attorney general to enforce these
16 public policies and prevent such harm.

17 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

18 25. This Court has jurisdiction to issue writs of mandate under Code of Civil
19 Procedure Section 1094.5.

20 26. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
21 Sections 393 and 394 as the Project is located in, and the relevant events
22 occurred in Riverside County.
23 27. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing the action by
24 complying with the requirements of Public Resources Code § 21167.5, in
25 notifying Respondent of the filing of this action (attached hereto as Exhibit "A"),
26 and by complying with the requirements of Public Resources Code § 21167.6, in

27 notifying Respondent of Petitioner's election to prepare the record of
28

-6-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Respondent proceedings (attached hereto as Exhibit "B").

2 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

3 28. Petitioner EHL commented to the City during the Project's administrative
4 review process that the EIR was legally inadequate including with respect to

5 biological resources, and that further mitigation for significant environmental

6 impacts was required.

7 29. As a result of these comments in the record, Petitioner exhausted its

8 administrative remedies pursuant to Cal. Public Resources Code, § 21177.
9 CAUSE OF ACTION
10 (Writ of Mandate)
11 (All parties did not comply with the requirements of CEQA.)

12 30. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates paragraphs through 29 above as 13 though set forth in full herein.
14 31. The California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") (Public Resources Code cop
15 21100 et seq.), enacted in 1971, requires government agencies to consider the
16 environmental consequences of their actions before approving projects subject to 17 CEQA's provisions. The Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") is considered
18 "the heart" of CEQA.
19 32. An EIR must accurately describe the Project it analyzes. (State CEQA
20 Guidelines, § 15124.) "An accurate, stable, and finite project description is the 21 sine qua non of an informative and legally sufficient EIR." (County of Inyo v. 22 City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 192-93.)
23 33. Petitioner and others commented that the EIR's project description is inadequate 24 in that the description of the South Parcel is unstable and uncertain. The EIR
25 contains conflicting information as to whether a "nature center" or "civic" or
26 some other "institutional" land use will be implemented on the South Parcel.
27 Moreover, there are a variety of uses that are conditionally permitted under the 28

-7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 purported "Nature Center" designation, to include "museum and galleries",
2 "restaurant", and "office". Yet the Final EIR does not adequately disclose and
3 evaluate these potential uses for the South Parcel. In fact, the Final EIR's

4 Appendix A is limited to purported analysis of the "nature center" use, and it

5 does not analyze these more intense uses that are conditionally permitted.

6 Additionally, the record indicates that the South Parcel may serve as a storage
7 site for soil during and after Project construction. Dirt stockpiling has not been

8 evaluated in the EIR as a potential use of the South Parcel, including an analysis
9 of how the storage of dirt and associated human activity will affect sensitive
10 species and habitats. Finally, the purported Nature Center/NCS land use
11 designation under the Specific Plan is apparently not a requirement, or a
12 condition of the Project's approval, and/or the record otherwise lacks certainty
13 that the Project will, in fact, develop a "Nature Center" as described in the Final
14 EIR.

15 34. To effectuate the Legislature's goals of environmental protection, CEQA

16 provides that an adequate EIR must evaluate all potentially significant
17 environmental impacts of a proposed project including both direct and indirect
18 impacts as well as cumulative impacts. (State CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15126,
19 15126.2 (a), 15130.)

20 35. CEQA creates a substantive mandate that lead agencies must mitigate the
21 significant environmental impacts of a proposed project. (Public Resources
22 Code, § 21002, 21002.1; State CEQA Guidelines, § 15021 (a).) In fact, a lead
23 agency may not approve a project for which there are significant environmental
24 impacts unless the agency makes findings that: (a) mitigation measures have
25 been required of the project which avoid or substantially lessen the significant
26 environmental impacts, or (b) mitigation measures are found to be infeasible
27

28

-8-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 based on substantial evidence. (Public Resources Code 8§ 21081, 21081.5; State
CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15091 (a)(b), 15092 (b).)

3

4 36. Also, mitigation measures must be certain and enforceable. (Public Resources

5 Code, § 21081.6(b); State CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.6(a)(2).) The lead agency

6 must ensure that mitigation measures are required by or incorporated into the

7 project to ensure that the measures are actually carried out. (Public Resources
Code § 21081.6 (a), (b).)

8

9 37. Petitioner and others commented that the EIR failed to adequately evaluate, and

10 that mitigation is inadequate, with respect to a number of significant impacts,

11 including aesthetic, air quality, biological, energy, greenhouse gas emissions,
land use, noise, traffic and cumulative impacts.

12

13 a) By way of example, EHL commented that there are significant,

14 unmitigated biological impacts due to development of the South Parcel.

15 The Project's South Parcel contains valuable wildlife habitat and provides

a

16 corridor for wildlife movement. Development of the South Parcel,

17 including the introduction of human intrusion and activity, would thus

18 adversely impact wildlife movement and habitats. Moreover, the

19 development of the South Parcel would reduce the width of the MSHCP's

20 Proposed Linkage 10 to 980 feet and Proposed Constrained Linkage to

21 255 to 450 fcet. Thus, the Project has adverse biological impacts as it

22 severely diminishes the functionality of the MSHCP linkages. The City

23 failed to adopt adequate mitigation to address these significant impacts.

24 b) By way of further example, the Project fails to adequate evaluate and

25 mitigate biological and land use impacts due to Project conflicts with the

26 MSHCP. The Project does not meet MSHCP conservation goals.

27 Because of this conflict with the MSHCP, EHL commented that a
"Criteria Refinement"

28 pursuant to the MSHCP (Section 6.5) was

-9-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

2 necessary before the Project could be validly approved. The City

3 declined to require that a Criteria Refinement be performed in conflict

4 with the MSHCP. As a result, the Project has significant and unmitigated

Un biological and land use impacts.

6 38. Petitioner and others also commented that the City failed to adopt all feasible

7 mitigation, and Petitioner and others proposed feasible mitigation that has not

8 been shown to be infeasible based on substantial evidence in the record.

9 a) By way of example, Petitioner proposed mitigation by way of letter on

10 December 12, 2017 to reduce impacts with respect to construction and

11 operation of the "Nature Center" to include: limiting the hours of

12 operation of the visitor center and trails to dusk; extensive fencing for

13 wildlife protection; enforcement of trail access; and coordination with

14 the wildlife agencies and RCA to determine if recontouring can benefit

15 the pond turtle (foraging habitat) and other Murrieta Creek species.

16 b) By way of further example, Petitioner and others suggested mitigation

17 with respect to biological and land use impacts, in particularly EHL

18 commented that the Project must complete the Criteria Refinement

19 process (MSHCP Section 6.5) prior to Project approval.

20 39. CEQA finally provides that a lead agency must evaluate alternatives to the

21 proposed project which would attain most of the basic objectives of the project

22 but would avoid or substantially lessen any of the project's significant

23 environmental effects. (State CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.6 (a).) The lead

24 agency has a duty to adopt a project alternative if it is feasible. (Public

25 Resources Code § 21002) As with feasible mitigation measures, a lead agency

26 may not reject an alternative unless the agency makes findings supported by
//

27 //

28 //

-10-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

substantial evidence showing that the alternative is infeasible. (Public Resources
Code, §§ 21081, 21081.5; State CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15091 (a)(3), 15092.) m t . 40. The City received comments that the EIR failed to adequately consider
alternatives to the proposed Project including alternatives with a smaller
footprint or an alternative with greater habitat and conservation features. In

6 addition, the City failed to support the rejection of alternatives with substantial

7 evidence in the record as required.

8 41. For these reasons, the City violated CEQA and the Project approvals must be set
9 aside. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1085, 1094.5; Public Resources Code § 21168.)
10 PRAYER FOR RELIEF
11 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays the following relief on all causes of action:
12 a) For the Court's peremptory writ of mandate requiring Respondent, City of
13 Temecula, to set aside its decision certifying the Final EIR for the Project.
14 b) For the Court's peremptory writ of mandate requiring Respondent, City of
15 Temecula, to set aside all Project approvals.
16 c) For such other and further relief, including preliminary and permanent
17 injunctive relief, in the event that a Real Parties in Interest, or their agents
18 or instrumentalities, intend to commence construction on the site while

19 this lawsuit is pending.

20 d) For such other relief as may be just and proper.
21 e) For the costs of this suit, including attorney's fees, pursuant to Code of
