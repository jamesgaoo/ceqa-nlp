25 PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of

26 Civil Procedure section 388, that on January 11,2018, Petitioners We Advocate Through

27 Environmental Review ("WATER") and Winnemem Wintu Tribe (*Tribe") (collectively

28 "Petitioners") filed a Petition for Writ of Mandate against Respondents County of Siskiyou and

- Petitioners We Advocate Through Environmental Review and Winnemem Wintu Tribe
N 0 to N (collectively "Petitioners") petition this Court for a Writ of Mandate, directed to Respondents
Siskiyou County and the Siskiyou County Board of Supervisors ("Respondents"). Petitioner
challenges Respondents' December 12,2017, approval of the use permit for a caretaker's
residence at 210 Ski Village Drive, Mt. Shasta, California (APN 037-140-090), Permit UP-16-
03 ("Permit"); and certification of the Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the Permit
(SCH# 2016062056). The Permit allows the Real Party in Interest, Crystal Geyser Water
co Company (*Crystal Geyser") to construct caretaker's residence adjacent to a water and a

9 beverage bottling plant Crystal Geyser intends to operate in the County near the City of Mount

10 Shasta ("City"). The County asserts that it has no authority over the operation of the bottling

11 plant, but can issue the Permit to allow the caretaker's residence on the bottling plant site. The

12 EIR, despite being prepared to support the County's approval of the Permit, describes the

13 "Project" as the entire bottling facility and operation. In this Petition for Writ of Mandate, the

14 caretaker's residence in addition to the bottling facility and operation is referred to as the

15 "Project" while the permit for the caretaker's residence (the discretionary approval actually

16 granted by the County) is referred to as the "Permit." The discretionary approval given by the

I7 County on December 12, 2017 was for the caretaker's residence Permit only. The EIR

18 describes the Project as follows: "The Proposed Project consists of the operation of spring

19 water bottling facility and ancillary uses within an approximately 118-acre site formerly

20 developed and operated as a water bottling plant. The Proposed Project consists of operational

21 and physical changes to the former bottling plant facilities for the production of sparkling water,

22 flavored water, juice beverages, and teas. This Environmental Impact Report (EIR) analyzes all

23 modifications undertaken and proposed by CGWC [Crystal Geyser] to operate the proposed

24 bottling plant facilities." Petitioners contend that Respondents' approvals for the Project violate

25 the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), Public Resources Code section 21000 et

26 seq. Additionally, the Project is inconsistent with the Siskiyou County General Plan and the

27 City of Mount Shasta General Plan contrary to the State Planning Laws. (Gov't Code § 65300

28 et seq.) Petitioners allege as follows:
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 2

M PARTIES

N m v l. Petitioner We Advocate Through Environmental Review ("WATER") is a
California non-profit corporation. WATER is a grass-roots organization established to
promote quality local and regional planning, land use and development, as well as to preserve a
healthy homan and natural environment in the Siskiyou County area. WATER and its
members have a direct and substantial beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondents comply

7 with the laws relating to zoning and environmental protection. Members of WATER live,

8 work and recreate in Siskiyou County and throughout the areas that will be impacted by the

9 Project. The interests of WATER will be harmed by the Project unless court action is taken

10 and Petitioners' requested relief is granted.

11 2. The Winnemern Wintu Tribe ("Tribe") is a Recognized California Historic Native

12 American Tribe, indigenous to northern California formally recognized by the California Native

13 American Heritage Commission, an agency of the State of California with responsibility for

14 preserving and protecting Native American sites and cultural resources in California.

15 Winnêmnem Wintu translates to Middie Water People as the McCloud River is bounded by the

16 Upper Sacramento to the West and the Pit River to the East. The interests and rights of the Tribe

17 and its members will be harmed by the Project unless court action is taken and Petitioners'

18 requested relief is granted. The Tribe has thousands of years of history with the land on which

19 the Project site is located. The Tribe derives its identity from its relationship with its historic

20 physical/cultural landscape through continuing ceremony and prayer. The Tribe's rights as a

21 Recognized California Historic Native American Tribe will be severely injured and the Tribe's

22 cultural values will not be considered when determining impacts and mitigation, if the adoption

23 of the Project is not set aside pending full compliance with CEQA and all other laws.

24 3. Both WATER and the Tribe, and their members, have long-standing interests in

25 the area adjacent to the Project site, as well as in the surrounding community and County as a

26 whole. The Petitioners' environmental, aesthetic, cultural and property interests will be

27 severely injured if the adoption of the Project is not set aside pending full compliance with

28 CEQA and all other laws. Petitioners enjoy the County's and State's natural resources.
VERIFIED PERITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

P Petitioners bring this petition on behalf of all others similarly situated who are too numerous to
petitioners. Petitioners are within the class of 2 be named and brought before this Court as
t persons and entities beneficially interested in, and aggrieved by, the acts of Respondents as
alleged below. Petitioners participated in the administrative processes herein, with many
to the Project. Petitioners have exhausted uE O members submitting comment letters and objecting

political subdivision of the State of California and their remedies. Accordingly, Petitioners have standing to sue.
A c Respondent Siskiyou County is
body corporate and politic exercising local government power. Siskiyou County is the CEQA 4.

9 "lead agency" for the Project. As lead agency for the Project, Siskiyou County is responsible for

10 preparation of an environmental document that describes the Project and its impacts, and, if

11 necessary evaluates mitigation measures and/or alternatives to lessen or avoid any significant

12 environmental impacts. The County also has principal responsibility for determining whether

13 projects within its jurisdiction are consistent with applicable land use ordinances and other

14 applicable laws.

15 5, Respondent Siskiyou County Board of Supervisors is legislative body duly

16 authorized under the California Constitution and the laws of the State of California to act on

17 behalf of the County of Siskiyou: Respondent Siskiyou County Board of Supervisors is

18 responsible for regulating and controlling land use within the County including, but not limited

19 to, implementing and complying with the provisions of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, [4

20 California Code of Regulations, title 14, section 15000 et seq. (the "Guidelines'), applicable

21 land use ordinances and other laws. As the elected representatives of the people of the County,

22 the Board of Supervisors establishes overall County priorities and sets policy. The Board of

23 Supervisors is the governing body of the County and is ultimately responsible for reviewing

24 and approving or denying the Permit.

25 6. Real Party in Interest Crystal Geyser Water Company ("Crystal Geyser") is a

for the Permit for a caretaker's residence that is being challenged by this Petition. Crystal
Geyser's corporate offices are located at 501 Washington Street, Calistoga, California in Napa
m tnon County. Crystal Geyser operates as a subsidiary of Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.
7. Petitioners are unaware of the true names and identities of DOES 1 through 20
aud 21 through 40, inclusive, and sue such unnamed Respondents and Real Parties in Iuterest
respectively, by their fictitious names. Petitioners are informed and believe, and based thereon
allege, that fictitiously named Respondents and Real Parties in Interest also are responsible for

8 all acts and omissions described above. When the true identities and capacities of Respondents

9 and Real Parties in Interest have been determined, Petitioners will, with leave of Court if

10 necessary, amend this Petition to include such identities and capacities.

11 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

12 8, This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to

13 Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, and Public Resources Code section 21168.5. In the

14 alternative, this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and

15 Public Resources Code section 21168,

16 9. Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the State of California

17 in and for the County of Siskiyou pursuant to sections 393, 394 and 395 of the Code of Civil

18 Procedure.

19 BACKGROUND FACTS

20 10. The Project site is located in Siskiyou County directly adjacent to the City of Mt.

21 Shasta city limits, on Ski Village Drive approximately 1,200 feet from the intersection with

22 Mt. Shasta Boulevard. The project site is comprised of fourteen parcels, Siskiyou County

23 ("County") Assessor's Parcel Numbers (APNs) 037- 060-030, -040, -050, -060; 037-070-060, -

24 070, -080, -090, -210; 037-140-020, -090; and, 037-160-010, - 020, -030, and is located in

25 Township 11 North, Range 4 West, Section 9 City of Mt. Shasta United States Geological

26 Survey (USGS) quadrangle. Regional access to the project site is provided by Interstate 5.

27 11. The Project site was used previously as a water bottling facility. Dannon Waters of
North American (prior to Dannon becoming Coca-Cola Dannon [CCDA WatersD acquired the 28
5 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

property and a draft Initial Study was prepared in March 1998 to address potential environmental

2 impacts and proposed mitigation measures for what is now the existing water bottling facility

3 (*Plant"). A Mitigation Agreement was entered into in November 1998 between the County and

4 the then applicant which incorporated the mitigation measures identified in the 1998 draft Initial

5 Study ("1998 Agreement"). The Plant was subsequently constructed between 1998 through

6 2000 by CCDA Waters and began operation in January 2001. The Plant facilities consisted of

7 the plant building and ancillary structures.

8 12. In 2001, CCDA Waters sought and received approval from the Central Valley

9 Regional Water Quality Control Board for an on-site leach field for industrial waste process

10 rinse water. The leach field as constructed could accommodate 72,000 gallons per day.

11 13, CCDA Waters operated the Plant from approximately 2000 to 2010 and it has

12 been reported (without specific documentation) that the facility used monthly average of

13 approximately 160 gallons per minute. It has also been reported by Plant neighbors that Plant

14 operations negatively impacted domestic wells in the area.

15 14. In 2010, CCDA Waters' Plant was closed and the majority of equipment used for

16 the bottling operation was removed. Crystal Geyser purchased the project site in 2013.

17 15. The Project site is bound immediately to the north by residential housing and

18 industrial businesses, to the east by low density residential (LDR) housing, to the south by the

19 Mt. Shasta KOA campground along with a railroad line and single family housing, and to the

20 west by single family housing, as well as industrial and commercial businesses. Residential

21 land uses in the project vicinity consists of varying lot sizes, generally at a greater density

22 inside the City limits, and range from suburban to rural. Jehovah's Witnesses Kingdom Hall is

23 northwest of the site, approximately 375 feet from the automobile entrance to the Plant.

24 Commercial and industrial land uses in the vicinity generally occupy larger lots to support

25 automotive and trucking based businesses. Beyond the immediate project vicinity,

26 surrounding uses include residential and commercial uses in the City, rural residences in the

27 unincorporated county, and both public and private forestland.

28
VERIFIED PETTTION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 6

1 16. The County's General Plan designates the Project site as Woodland Productivity

2 and Building Foundation Limitations: Severe Pressure Limitations Soils. The central project

3 site that contains the Plant and leach field is zoned M-H (Heavy Industrial), the northern

4 project site that contains the production well is zoned AG-2 (Non-Prime Agricultural), and the
eastern project site is zoned R-R-B-1 (Rural Residential Agricultural District).
6 17. On January 12,2017, Respondent County issued a Draft EIR for the Project.

7 Petitioners and many others submitted extensive comments on the Draft EIR. Respoudent

8 County issued a Final EIR for the Project and scheduled a Planning Commission hearing for

9 September 20,2017. The Planning Commission hearing occurred on that date and was then

10 continued to September 27, 2017. Petitioners and many others submitted extensive comments on

11 the Final BIR and during the Planning Commission hearing.

12 18. On September 27, 2017, the Planning Commission approved-the Project and

13 certified the BIR. Petitioners appealed the decision to the Board of Supervisors.

14 19. On November 16, 2017, the Board of Supervisors held a public hearing on the

15 appeal, heard presentations from Petitioners, Crystal Geyser and County staff, and heard public

16 testimony. The Board closed the hearing on November 16, 2017, and continued the item to

I7 December 12,2017, with a request to County staff to provide clarifications and answers to

18 questions raised at the public hearing.

19 20. On December 12, 2017, the Board or Supervisors received the report from staff,

20 denied the appeal, approved the Project and certified the EIR.

21 21. The Project description is at odds with the approval given by the County to

22 Crystal Geyser. The County repeatedly and emphatically throughout the EIR process asserted

23 that it has no authority over the operation of the bottling facility, and that the only discretionary

24 approval within the County's authority was the Permit for the caretaker's residence. Yet, the

25 EIR for the "Project" includes analysis of the entire bottling facility and operation, The EIR

26 makes unsupported assumptions regarding the level of production anticipated as well as

27 making predictions and conducting analysis regarding every other aspect of the bottling facility

28 operations, all the while the County claimed that it had no ability whatsoever to place any type
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 7

of restriction on the bottling facility operations. Further, the County does have the authority

2 and the duty to regulate the operations at the Plant because the Project includes the production

3 of flavored water, juice beverages, and teas.

4 22, By including the bottling facility operations as part of the "Project" being

5 reviewed by the County, and by certifying the EIR, it appears the County was attempting to

6 provide a basis for various responsible agencies to take action on future permits from agencies
D such as the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the City of Mount Shasta, the Regional

8 Water Quality Control Board and the United States Army Corps of Engineers.

9 23. The BIR largely defers analysis and mitigation of impacts to the future, relying

10 upon the notion that the responsible agencies will figure out what impacts the bottling facility

11 will have on the environment, and presumably require mitigation for such impacts.

12 24. During Project review by the County, Petitioners and others submitted extensive

13 comments and objections regarding the Project and its associated EIR to the County Board of

14 Supervisors. Petitioners counsel also presented significant concerns during the appeal hearing

15 before the Board of Supervisors that the EIR improperly stated that the "Project" under review

16 Was the bottling facility and all of its associated operations, and failed to disclose that the only

17 action being considered by the County was the "Permit" for the caretaker's residence. It is

18 misleading to the public and the decision makers, and the entire EIR implies that the County

19 has some authority to require mitigation or even a stable project description for the bottling

20 operations, when the opposite is true: the County emphatically denies having any power to

21 control or regulate those operations.

22 25, On December 12,2017, over Petitioners' myriad objections, the Siskiyou County

23 Board of Supervisors approved the Project and Certified the EIR.

24 26. On December 13, 2016, Respondents filed a Notice of Determination with the

25 County Clerk of Siskiyou County as provided for in Public Resources Code, section 21152.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 8

NaUAW N- EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES
AND INADEQUACX OF REMEDY

27. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant
action and have exhausted any and all avallable administrative remedies to the extent required

by law.

28. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code,

8 section 21167.5 by mailing written notice of this action to the Respondents. A copy of this
written notice and proof of service are attached as Exhibit A to this Petition for Writ of

9 Mandate.

10 29. Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.6 by

11 concurrently filing request concerning preparation of the record of administrative

12 proceedings relating to this action,

13 30.

14 Petitioners have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary

15 law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside

16 their approval of the Project and certification of the EIR. In the absence of such remedies,
Respondents' approval will remain in effect in violation of State law.

17 31, This action has been brought within 30 days of the filing of the Notice of
18 Determination as required by Public Resources Code section 21167(c).

19 STANDING

20 32. Petitioners have standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because

21

22 Petitioners' aesthetic, environmental and property interests are directly and adversely affected
by Respondents' certification of the EIR and approval of the Project. The Tribe also has

23 standing because the Tribe's rights and cultural interests as acknowledged and defined by

24 A.B52 are directly and adversely affected by

25 approval of the Project. Respondents' certification of the EIR and

26 ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS ACTIONS

27 33, Petitioners bring this action on the basis, among others, of Government Code

28 section 800, and other applicable laws, which award Petitioners' attorneys* fees in actions to
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 9.

overturn agency decisions that are arbitrary and capricious, such as the decisions here in

2 question.

m v 1 . PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE

34. Petitioners bring this action as private attorneys general pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important rights
affecting the public interest. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a
7 significant benefit on a large class of persons by ensuring that Respondent County does not

8 approve the Project in the absence of lawful environmental review and compliance with

9 applicable local and state zoning law.
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 2 - Abuse of Discretion 11
12 Violation of CEQA, Public Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.

13 35. Petitioners reallege and incorporate herein, as if set forth in full, each and every

14 allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 34.

15 36. In approving the Project as described herein, Respondent County prejudicially

16 abused its discretion in violation of CBQA pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21168

17 and Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, because the County certified an EIR that fails to

18 include information necessary for informed decision making and informed public participation,

19 including information necessary to reach informed conclusions regarding the significance of

20 the Project's environmental impacts, the effectiveness of mitigation measures to avoid the

21 Project's significant environmental impacts, or feasibility of mitigation measures to reduce the

22 Project's significant environmental impacts; because the EIR fails to lawfully assess the

23 Project's cumulative effects; because the BIR fails to use the best available information and/or

24 accepted methodology for analyzing information; because the Final EIR fails to provide good

25 faith responses to comments on the Draft EIR; because the County failed and refused to

26 provide a stable, finite Project description by obscuring the fact that the only authority the

27 County has over any aspect of Crystal Geyser's activities relates to the caretaker's residence
Permit only; because, with respect to the findings required by CBQA, the County failed to
10 28
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OP MANDATE

make required findings, failed to support the findings with substantial evidence, and failed to

2 disclose the analytic route showing how the evidence supports the findings.
m 71n vo 37. Petitioners allege that the County violated CEQA as detailed in a number of
comment letters submitted by Petitioners and others during the administrative review process,
including, without limitation, the appeal submittals to the County by counsel for Petitioners.
Petitioners allege that the County violated CEQA in a manner summarized in comments and

7 appeal submittals addressed in staff reports prepared for the November 16, 2017 and December

8 12, 2017, Board of Supervisors hearings on the Project, including all of the attachments to

9 those staff reports. Petitioners intend to prosecute all of the alleged violations of CEQA

10 described herein and in the documents submitted by Petitioners during the administrative

11 review process. By way of illustration, and without limitation, Petitioners allege the following

12 violations of CEQA by the County:

13 38, Respondents have abused their discretion and failed to act in the manner required

14 under CEQA with respect to the Project because they have failed to provide an adequate, stable

15 project description, failed to adequately analyze the Project's environmental impacts, failed to

16 identify necessary and feasible mitigation measures, fatled to complete consultation with the

17 Tribe under AB 52, and impermissibly deferred analysis of impacts and development of

18 mitigation measures to the future.

19 I. Mitigation Measures are not enforceable as required by CEQA

20 39. The EIR, despite being prepared to support the County's approval of the Permit,

21 describes the "Project" as the entire bottling facility and operation. The discretionary approval

22 given by the County on December 12, 2017 was for the caretaker's residence Permit. The BIR

23 describes the Project as follows: "The Proposed Project consists of the operation of a spring

24 water bottling facility and ancillary uses within an approximately 118-acre site formerly

25 developed and operated as a water bottling plant. The Proposed Project consists of operational

26 and physical changes to the former bottling plant facilities for the production of sparkling

27 water, flavored water, juice beverages, and teas. This Environmental Impact Report (EIR)

28 analyzes all modifications undertaken and proposed by CGWC to operate the proposed
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 11

1 bottling plant facilities." (Draft FIR, p. 3-1, emphasis added.) The record is clear that the

2 County has no intention of defining, regulating or otherwise exercising any authority over the

3 bottling facility operation, and insists that it has authority only it over the caretaker's residence

4 Permit issued to Crystal Geyser. The Project description is not just misleading, it appears to be
un for another project entirely. In fact, in the introduction to the Project Description Chapter of
6 the EIR, the caretaker's residence is not even mentioned.
•N 40. County asserted in response to these concerns that the conditions pertaining to the

8 operation of the bottling facility would be included in the Permit for the caretaker's residence.

9 The record reveals that the caretaker's residence has limited usefulness because the Health

10 Risk Assessment in the BIR indicates that living in the home full-time would result in an

11 unacceptable risk of developing cancer or other healtli problems. There is no substantial

12 evidence in the record to support the conclusion that Crystal Geyser wants or needs a

13 caretaker's residence, and certainly no evidence to support the assumption that Crystal Geyser

14 will even go ahead with construction of the residence in light of the fact that it will be

15 dangerous to live there. There is no sound basis is for a conclusion that all of the conditions on

16 the bottling facility operations will be enforceable through the caretaker's residence Permit.

17 41. Despite the County's claim that it has no authority over the bottling operation, the

18 operation proposed by Crystal Geyser, including the production and bottling of juice and tea

19 beverages, is subject to County permitting authority.

20 42. The bottling plant operation is also subject to the permitting authority of various

21 other agencies, and so an environmental document will be necessary with respect to the

22 discretionary actions of the responsible agencies, and it must cover all of the plant operations

23 in order for the responsible agencies to issue their permits. It is unclear why, among the

24 potential lead agencies for the bottling facility Project, that the agency with the least authority

25 ended up as the lead agency. The County took on the task as the lead agency but failed to

26 consider its lack of ability to enforce conditions if the only aspect of the Project over which the

27 County claims to have authority is the caretaker's residence.

u -•N 0 t II. The County failed to complete AB52 consultation with the Winnemem Wintu Tribe

43. The staff reports for the November 16, 2017 and December 12, 2017 hearings
state that the consultation process required upon request under AB 52 had been completed.
This is incorrect, and the County unilaterally terminated the consultation process on September

6 6,2017. The County suggested that the consultation process had been lengthy, but this does
not satisfy the termination requirements of the statute. The County did not find in "good faith"

8 that after "reasonable effort" agreement cannot be reached. (Public Resources Code §

9 21080.3.2 (b)(2).) The County's unilateral termination was based upon an assertion that the

10 Tribe had not produced substantial evidence to support its assertion that the Project would have

11 potentially significant impacts to Tribal Cultural Resources and that the County's timeline

12 precluded further consultation. This does not meet the standard of AB 52 and improperly

13 characterizes the obligations of the respective parties during consultation. The County was

14 required by AB 52 to consult with the Tribe regarding the significance of Project impacts, and

15 it did not do sO. There is no substantial evidence to support the claim that the County is in
compliance with AB 52.

16 44.

17 In addition to improper termination of the consultation, the deficiencies of the

18 Project description did not allow meaningful and comprehensive AB 52 consultation because

19 there is no upper limit on the volume of water that will be extracted by Crystal Geyser, and the
County asserts that it has 110

20 authority to limit the extraction amounts. Only after the Project

21 description is corrected will the Tribe and the County be able to consult on the significance of
adverse effects, mitigation measures and/or Project alternatives.

22 45.

23 Further, the CEQA Findings state that no known tribal cultural resources were

24 identified in the Study Area. (CEQA Findings, p. 21.) This is simply inaccurate, as such

25 resources were identified and acknowledged by the County, There is no substantial evidence

26 to support this statement, the consultation with the Tribe was abruptly and improperly

27 terminated by the County, and the "fact" contained in the CEQA Findings is incorrect.

F III. The EIR for the Project contains an inaccurate Project Description

46. As set forth above, the BIR contains a project description that is almost unrelated 2

cn to the discretionary Permit that was issued by the County in conjunction with certification of
the BIR. The Project description is so inaccurate that the public and decision makers were

that it has it v 1 completely confused about what was being considered and approved by the County,
47. The County asserted through the entire administrative review process
n no authority to issue a permit for the bottling operation, Because the Project includes the

8 production of flavored water, juice beverages, and teas, the Couuty not only has the authority

9 to issue a permit, it must issue a discretionary permit for Crystal Geyser to produce these

10 value-added products. Thus, the County does have the authority to regulate the entire

limits for the extraction of ground water and therefore any residence that includes any upper

15 analysis of impacts to the hydrology of the area and to the Tribal Cultural Resources will
if the inherent limits of production line capacities, waste 16 necessarily be inadequate. Even

17 stream disposal, etc. were never exceeded, the Project operator could easily, and without
18 environmental review, transport extracted ground water by truck in unlimited quantities to an

19 off-site facility for processing and bottling.
if Thus, even if one assumes that the CEQA "project" approved by the County 20 49,

21 included the bottling facility operations the Project description is inaccurate.

50, CEQA requires that the full level of development and use being authorized by an

23 approval must be analyzed and its effects mitigated. The EIR for the project fails to meet this 22

24 standard. Appellants raised this issue in comments on the Draft EIR.
25 51. The EIR describes the production levels as 90% of what would be "possible" with
26 the equipment at the Plant, but also states that the County has no authority to place any upper
limit on production levels. The Draft EIR Project description includes a host of speculative
"scenarios," and leaves the public and the decision makers wondering what the Project will

actual entail. The volume of wastewater varies, depending upon "market demand." Bither one

2 O1 two bottling lines will operate, depending on "market conditions," and the plant may operate

3 "up to 24 hours per day (depending on demand)." (Draft EIR, p. 3-9.)

4 52, The Project is not described in the BIR. The County did not even approve of the
bottling operations, and yet the BIR goes through hundreds of pages of analysis of various

6 scenarios with unsupported assumptions regarding bottling facility operations, as though the

7 County was approving "project" that included operation of the Plant.

8 53. Under CEQA, the inclusion in the BIR of a clear and comprehensive description

9 of the proposed project is critical to accurate analysis of impacts and meaningful public review.

IO The BIR in this case failed to meet this requirement,

11 IV. The EIR includes impermissibly narrow project objectives

12 54. Many of the presumptions throughout the EIR are based upon the notion that there

13 is some urgency in "meeting market demand," although it is never disclosed in the BIR what

14 factual basis there may be for the urgent need for Project approval in order to meet this

15 purported demand. The way that the objectives of a project are drafted impact the CEQA

16 analysis, particularly consideration of alternatives and mitigation measures.

17 55. The Draft BIR states that it "considered" an alternative of delaying operation of

18 the Project until the Lassen Substation power project is completed, This alternative would

19 avoid the use of propane generators and reduce GHG and CAP emissions. (Draft BIR, p. 6-5.)

20 The alternative was dismissed from full consideration becanse it would "not accomplish any of

21 the project objectives in the short term." (Ibid.) The objective identified was that of initiating

22 plant operation "as soon as possible to meet increasing demand for Crystal Geyser beverage

23 products." All of the Project objectives are driven by the purported "need" for Crystal Geyser

24 to meet immediate demand for its products, (Draft BIR, p. 3-8.)

25 56. Various statements and information were submitted by Crystal Geyser during the

26 administrative process regarding the purported "need" to meet market demands, thereby

27 precluding consideration of alternatives that would avoid environmental impacts, but none

28 meets the standard for substantial evidence under CEQA,
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 15

- V. The EIR's impacts analysis is insufficient

57. Allegations in this Petition regarding the failure of the EIR to adequately analyze
impacts necessarily include the assumption that the County was analyzing the impacts of a
CEQA "project" that included the bottling facility operations, despite the fact that the County
insists that it has no authority over the bottling facility operations and was providing a
discretionary Permit for the caretaker's residence only. The question of what the CEQA
0 0 "project" was in this case is a threshold issue. Many of the allegations here are based upon the
EIR's Project Description Chapter and analyses throughout, and are not based upon the

9 County's assertion that it has no authority over the Project as described in the BIR.

10 A. Impacts to aesthetics

11 58. The error in the Draft BIR analysis of the Project's aesthetic impacts begins with

12 an unsupported assumption that the plant is not a "dominant" visual feature, County's

13 response to this assertion was that the plant may be visible from long-range, but this does not

14 mean it is a dominant visual feature, while going on to acknowledge that it is also one of the

15 most prominent non-natural features.

16 59. According to the County, the existing visibility of the plant will not be addressed

17 because it is an existing condition, despite the fact that the "existing" situation is in violation of

18 the 1998 Mitigation Agreement; the same Mitigation Agreement the County claims will be

I9 incorporated into the mitigation measures for the Project.

20 60. The Final EIR continued the error of the Draft EIR by simply giving credit to the
discussed in 21 applicant for all of the mitigation measures identified in the 1998 Agreement and

22 the Project Description chapter. And yet, the Draft EIR goes on to accept that "[tJhe existing

23 warehouse is a reflective white surface that cal produce-local glare during daytime hours."
24 (DEIR, p. 4.1-6.) In Response to comments, the County indicated that it will not be enforcing

25 the mitigation measures required in the 1998 Agreement for "existing" structures on the site.

26 There is no explanation as to why this is the case, except for the statement that enforcement of

27 the 1998 Agreement is "beyond the scope of the project." (Final EIR, p. 3-8.)

I6 28
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- 61. The 1998 Agreement is a separate, ongoing, enforceable agreement, and the

2 County's choice to forego enforcement is just that, a choice. The failure to enforce is not an

3 existing "baseline condition."
v B. Air quality impacts

62. Beginning with the Draft EIR, the entire air quality analysis, including analysis of
1o greenhouse gas cmissions, was so deeply flawed that it was difficult to present discussion in

7 comments on the Draft EIR. Autumn Wind Associates provided an expert analysis of the air

8 quality sections in the Draft EIR, and found that the basic inputs and assumptions had been

9 heavily manipulated to "reduce" the apparent level of impact.

10 63 . In response to comments on the Draft EIR, the County prepared a revised

11 emissions analysis, The revised analysis did not remedy the errors.

12 64. In the Draft EIR, the Project appeared to have a minimal impact on air quality, as

13 the Executive Summary in the Draft BIR concludes that all air quality impacts are less than

14 significant, except for the increased cancer risk for the people living in the caretaker's

15 residence. (Draft EIR, p. 2-5.) This seemed surprising in light of the tremendous number of

16 truck trips that will result from operation of the Project.

17 65. Rather than use the methodology and inputs that are the standard of the industry

18 for air quality analysis, and rather than including all of the truck traffic that the Project will

19 generate, the County modified the inputs, misstating the types of truck traffic as well as

20 modifying the standard assumptions for General Heavy Industrial analyses in such a way that

21 the conclusions falf below thresholds of significance.

22 66. The County acknowledged that the Project use is General Heavy Industrial.

23 (Draft BIR, Appendix M, pp. 8-11.) Appendix M to the Draft EIR identified a trip rate applied

24 to the General Industrial land use type, but at numerous locations, the "General Light Industry"

25 land use had been substituted without explanation. Further, standard trip rate values had been

26 overridden for the DEIR analysis, also without explanation. The arbitrary deviation from

27 standard, industry-accepted methodology was not supported by substantial evidence, and the

28 Draft E1R sited to none.
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 17

67. The Autumn Winds comment letter pointed out to the County that the Project will

2 generate many more trips than those considered in the Draft EIR and that the standard fleet mix

3 had been so heavily modified, leaving out the heaviest vehicles, it rendered the conclusions

4 invalid.

5 68. In response to comments, the Final EIR included substantial emissions input-
6 related chauges, but the changes did not remedy the errors of the Draft BIR. Emissions remain

7 underestimated for CAP and GHG pollutants, and the screening-level Health Risk Assessment

8 ("HRA") conducted for the DEIR and carried through unrevised to the Final EIR now reflects

9 substantially underestimated health risks.

10 69. In the Final EIR, the County also has abandoned any threshold of significance for

11 CAP emissions from mobile sources. The County admits that the revised modeling reveals

12 significantly increased emissions from mobile sources, but declines to use the threshold of

13 significance that was applied to these emissions in the Draft EIR, claiming "Siskiyou County is

14 in attainment for all CAP's, [and] numerical thresholds have not been established for mobile

15 emissions." (Final BIR, p. 3-24.) In other words, the County applied the Rule 6.1 threshold to

16 all Project CAP emissions in the Draft EIR, but when the revised modeling revealed that the

17 mobile emissions would exceed this threshold, the County abandoned it and now claims that

18 there is no applicable threshold. A lead agency may not analyze an impact without using a

19 threshold of significance, and the fact that another agency has not established a threshold does

20 not excuse the County from this requirement,

21 70. The revised modeling included in the Final EIR is as deeply flawed as the original

22 effort prepared for the Draft EIR. The County continued to modify the carefully developed

23 fleet mix, and provides little in the way of explanation. No substantial evidence is cited by the

24 County to explain the changes in the fleet mix, particularly the decision to remove heavy-

25 heavy-duty trucks from the General Light Industry category under which the Project is

26 covered. The Project's mobile source emissions continue to be underestimated.

27 71. The Health Risk Assessment ("HRA") fails to meet CEQA's standards as well.

28 The revised modeling in the Final EIR shows increased truck trips and an increased proportion
VERIFIED PRTITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE I8

of heavy-heavy trucks (that, relatively, emit the most diesel particulate matter in the fleet mix),

2 with increasing mobile source emissions (excopt for CO, which decreased slightly). While the

0 Final EIR recognizes the increase in criteria air pollutants that will result, it does not include a
correlative increase in diesel particulate matter, relevant to health risks, into the original
w HRA's findings. Those findings were based on 100 "heavy duty" trucks. The Final EIR
PM2.5 emissions 6 analysis shows 103, but with a higher fraction of the heavy-heavy's, and

7 have increased,

8 72. The County failed to run the screening level HRA with the new mobile source

9 information, and as a result, the HRA is inaccurate. Emissions estimated in the Final EIR's
the Draft BIR 10 revised Air Quality element have increased substantially over what was used in

11 to model the project's health risks.

12 73. With the Final BIR emissions data, modeling was been conducted by Dr. Andrew

13 Gray of Gray Sky Solutions, and the increase in DPM-containing PM2.5 will cause the
maximum cancer risk for the most at-risk residents to exceed the 10/million increased 14 project's
cancer risk threshold of significance, rendering the Final BIR's determination of a 15

16 less-than-significant risk invalid. The County refutes these conclusions, but the process of

17 running a new HRA with the new emissions data was required.

18 74. The Final EIR also failed to remedy other problems with the air quality analysis.

19 For example, the use of "urban" trip lengths in the CalEEMod modeling remains inappropriate.

20 Also, the abandonment of any threshold of significance for mobile sources of CAP emissions

21 is not consistent with the law.

22 C. Greenhouse Gas Emissions

23 75. The greenhouse gas and climate change impacts sections of the EIR rely upon

24 Appendix M, discussed in detail above, as well as the revised emissions data included in the

25 Final BIR, and that analysis is so inaccurate that it is of very little use in terms of providing

26 support for any conclusions regarding GHG emissions.

27 76. Also omitted from the emissions analysis is any consideration of CO, emissions

28 that will occur as a direct result of the Project's consumption of materials used for making
19 VBRIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

bottles. The Project will produce single-use polyethylene terephthalate ("PET") bottles for its

2 products. (Draft BIR, p. 3-9.) The bottles will be molded on site using "preforms." (Id.)
is There is no discussion of how many bottles will be produced, nor any consideration of the
GHG emissions associated with making the preforms. The manufacture of one ton of PET
produces 3 tons of CO2. This contribution to total GHG emissions must be included.
77. The GHG analysis also includes HVAC use in such a way that is not supported by

7 any evidence. (Draft EIR, p. 4.6-13.) "The HVAC system was assumed to run two hours a

8 day, 160 days annually, with four heating units." There is no discussion of why the heating

9 units would be used for only two hours per day, particularly in light of local cold winter

10 conditions. There is also no mention of how much the air conditioning units will be used.

11 Since teas will be brewed and boilers will be used, it is likely some cooling of the building will

12 be required in the summer. GHG emissions from the AC system must be evaluated.

13 78. The Draft EIR properly determined that the Project's GHG emissions would be

14 significant and unavoidable impact. (Draft BIR, p. 4.6-17.) Under CEQA, this determination

15 gives rise to a legal obligation to impose all feasible measures to mitigate. the impact. (CEQA

16 Guidelines § 15126.4.) The DEIR fails to provide an adequate discussion of potential

17 mitigation measures.

18 79. THE GHG emission analysis is also flawed by the fact that the EIR uses various

19 "scenarios" to discuss potential emissions, and none of the scenarios take into account the fact

20 that the County asserts that it has no authority to impose any limits on the production levels of

21 the bottling facility. Thus, the GHG emissions resulting from the Project will not be 25,486

22 metric tons ("MT") of CO, per year, but could be something far greater. (See Draft EIR, p.

23 4.6-16, Table 4,6-2.)

24 80. The Draft EIR lísts a menu of mitigation measures that could be used "to achieve

25 a net reduction of 25,486 MT of CO, annually." (Draft EIR, p. 4.6-18.) Possibly some solar

26 arrays, encourage employees to carpool, and then buy some offset credits from the carbon

27 registry. (Ibid.) This menu of items is also proposed in the context of the fact that there is no

28 upper limit on production at the Plant, the faulty air emissions study contained in Appendix M,
VERIFIED PETITION POR WRIT OF MANDATE 20

1 not to mention the fact that it assumes a credit for the Project recycling a percentage of its

2 waste stream, without a clear explanation of how that will occur.
c v 81. Finally, the Draft EIR errs in jumping to the conclusion that the Project's impacts
related to climate change are significant and unavoidable, without conducting the analysis of
5 why this is the case. (Keep Berkeley Jets Over the Bay Com. V. Board of Port Commissioners
6 (2001) 91 Cal.App.4" 1344, 1371.) The Draft EIR states that the Project is necessary to allow

7 Crystal Geyser to meet the vaguely described "increasing market demand."

8 82. In response to comments, the County continued on the path of simply making the

9 finding that it is a significant and unavoidable impact, and does not consider additional

10 mitigation measures. (Final EIR, p. 3-24.) "As shown in Table 4.6-2 of the Final EIR, the

11 estimates of GHG emissions with the changes to the revised project assumptions increased

12 from 35,486 metric tons (MT) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) per year to 61,281 MT of

13 CO2e per year. As a result, Mitigation Measure 4,6-1 within the Final EIR has been re vised to

14 require an equal increase in the amount of off-set mitigation required; thus after mitigation, the

15 severity of the environmental effect does not change between the Draft EIR and the Final

16 EIR." (Id.) Thus, the revised analysis in the Final EIR shows that the Project will have nearly

17 twice the level of GHG emissions as stated in the Draft BIR, and yet the County continues to

18 avoid the consideration and adoption of additional mitigation measures. (See Final EIR, pp. 3-

19 12 and 3-17.) This violates CEQA's requirements.

20 D. Noise impacts

21 83. The EIR fails to analyze noise impacts, and also fails to disclose information

22 regarding noise impacts to the public and the decision makers. The Final EIR analysis picks and

23 chooses from data in the Draft EIR and from the revised noise study presented with the Final

24 EIR. The EIR uses noise thresholds that have been superseded and are not the standard for the

25 industry. The County intentionally used a residence 80 feet from the railroad track to develop a
"baseline" and compounded the errors in the noise analysis for leaving out sensitive receptor. 26

27 //1

28
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 21

84. The residence at 333 Raspberry Way was left out of the study, despite the fact that
the HVAC N mtON∞ it is directly across the street from the project and the nearest sensitive receptor to
equipment and boiler vents in the front of the bottling plant.

85. Rather than correcting the errors contained in the Draft EIR's analysis, the Final
EIR includes additional errors in methodology as well as considerable misinformation. The
County's conclusions regarding the noise impacts of the Project are not supported by

substantial evidence.

86. The thresholds used in the EIR to determine incremental significance for all

9 project noise sources are out-of-date and inappropriate for industrial noise sources. Comments

10 submitted to the County be noise experts and others pointed out this flaw in the methodology.

11 Further, in the revised study for the Final EIR, the County chose to use a residence located

12 approximately 80 feet from the railroad tracks to develop a "ney" noise baseline. (See Final

13 EIR, p. 3-44.) Site 4 is used by the County to justify an increase in the baseline noise level in

14 order to mask the noise impacts of the Project.

15 87. The responses to comments dismiss concerns about exceedance of noise

16 standards, claiming that a 1-4 dB exceedance is minor. Even a 1 dB increase in 24-hour levels

17 represents a potentially significant impact to local sensitive receptors that may require

18 mitigation, The evidence in the record does not support the Final EIR's conclusions regarding

19 noise impacts.

20 88. With respect to noise mitigation, the EIR allows for a choice between requiring

21 quieter equipment or shielding. The use of both measures would provide the greatest

22 mitigation, and unless there is substantial evidence to support the conclusion that employing

23 both measures would be infeasible, then both must be required of the applicant.

24 E. Hazards and hazardous matorials

25 89. The County falled to require an adequate level of analysis of potential

26 contamination at the Project site. The Final EIR states as follows: "A Phase I BSA is

27 generally considered the first step in the process of environmental due diligence and does not

28 include the actual sampling of soil, air, groundwater, and/or building materiais. If the Phase
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 22

P ESA determines that a site may be contaminated, a Phase II ESA may be conducted." (Final

2 BIR, p, 4,7-2.) In response to comments, the County acknowledges that some of the

3 contaminated portions of the Project site required soil removal and there is some question

4 about the records supporting the conclusion that the removal actually occurred. (Final EIR, p.

5 3-196.) The fact that there are not conclusive records regarding the removal of the

6 contaminants indicates that a Phase II ESA is required, at the very least. The vague support for

7 the County's conclusion that the material was removed does not constitute substantial

8 evidence.

9 F. Impacts to hydrology

10 90. The Project's impacts to groundwater have not been adequately disclosed and

11 analyzed in the EIR. The EIR fails to adequately address potential impacts to nearby wells.
as well as 12 The analysis falls short with respect to analyzing impacts to groundwater levels

13 groundwater quality.

14 91. The EIR fails to disclose with sufficient detail the chemicals that will be used at

15 the bottling plant as well as the impacts that will result to groundwater.

16 92, Many comments from local residents were submitted to the County regarding the

17 impacts to domestic wells during the time the Plant was operating between approximately 2000

18 and 2010. In response to comments, the County claimns that the evidence submitted by

19 commenters is "anecdotal." (Final EIR, p. 3-35, 3-107, 3-204 and 3-251.) Personal

20 observations may qualify as substantial evidence, and in this case, the observations are based

21 upon facts and the County may not dismiss the commenters' concerns on the ground that some

22 of the evidence submitted is based upon non-expert observations.
23 93, The fact is that operation of the Plant impacts neighborhood wells, and the County

24 and its experts have done everything possible to ignore this evidence, including making

25. assumptions about future pumping levels without substantial evidence to support the

26 assumption and in conjunction with the claim that the County has no authority to limit

27 pumping levels. The personal observations of Project neighbors are substantial evidence, and

28 the County's disregard of this information was an abuse of discretion.
VBRIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 23

I 94. In addition to the failure to take into account substantial evidence of potentially

2 to significant impacts to groundwater, the County also failed to conduct an adequate investigation

3 into potential impacts. The Final BIR gives no adequate response to the suggestion that water

4 flow patterns may well be far more complicated than the simple model relied upon and that

5 direct testing needs to be done. (See Final EIR, pp. 3-362 to 3-364.) Furthermore, there is no

6 proposed mitigation concerning what to do if neighboring wells are impacted by the Project.

7 95. The Final EIR claims that Crystal Geyser's pumping with two production lines

8 would amount to only 28% of the flow rate in the aquifer below the extraction well for the

9 Project (known as DEX-6). That flow rate (and its direction) is, in fact, not well known. Its

10 calculation is not based on known data and some important data was disregarded by the

11 County. Based on the evidence in the record, the actual flow rate could be much less than

I2 assumed. Moreover, even assuming the unsupported conclusion that the Project will cause 28%

13 depletion of the groundwater, that level of depletion could cause significant impacts to

14 neighboring wells.

15 96. With respect to potential water quality impacts, the Planning Commission failed

16 to discuss which wastewater treatment option it was approving when it approved the Project.

17 The Findings contain no mention of which option was approved. The Final EIR and Response

18 to Comments (Number 16, page 3-17; Comment P25-3, page 3-116; Comment P35-14, page 3-

19 143; Comment P36-66, page 3-160, Comment P36-235, page 202; Comment P139-2, page 3-

20 376) state: "The initial wastewater treatment option will be selected prior to project approval."

21 The Planning Commission failed to deliver on this commitment relied upon by the County in

22 its responses to comments. Similarly, the Board of Supervisors ignored this commitment and

23 failed to identify a wastewater treatment option,

24. 97. According to City comments, the only wastewater treatment option that is

25 acceptable to the City is Option 1, with all flows going the City Wastewater Treatment Plan

26 ("WWTP"). The City, as a responsible agency, will now be faced with a Project approval that

27 fails to identify which wastewater treatment option has been approved, despite the fact that the

28 City is the agency that will be providing wastewater treatment services.
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 24

-

- 98.

2 In addition to the City's request that Option be included in Project approval, the

3 California Regional Water Quality Control Board submitted a letter to the County regarding

4 the Project on September 18,2017, stating that it strongly encouraged the County to

5 recommend that Crystal Geyser's wastewater be sent to the City's WWTP to the extent

6 is capacity is available, rather than to the onsite leachfield. The Planning Commission ignored

7 this issue and failed to select the wastewater treatment option before project approval as was

8 promised in the County's response to comments, and So did the Board of Supervisors.

99.

9 In addition to the failure to identify the wastewater treatment option, the County

10 ignored many comments submitted by members of the public and experts regarding wastewater

11 constituents that were completely ignored in the analysis. Many substances that will be

12 contained in Project wastewater and several of these substances were ignored in the EIR, or not

13 sufficiently analyzed. Some examples of such constituents are: refrigerant (tetraflouroethane);
halogenated organic compounds; and cleaning agents.

14 G. Lighting Impaets

15

16 100. Lighting of loading areas on the East side of the plant is never described in the

17 EIR. The entire outdoor lighting plan must be supplied in order to ascertain the significance of

18 nighttime lighting. The lighting plan described in Appendix F or in Section 3,5.5 is totally
inadequate, showing nothing of lighting locations and light distribution.

19

20 101, Comments were submitted stating that the nighttime illumination of all eight

21 loading docks in itself constitutes a significant lighting increase over current conditions, but the

22 report mentions the improvements of the amount of light cast off site would be minimized and

23 not substantially increased over 2013 conditions (security lighting only). The EIR failed to
quantify this or disclose the methods used to determine this assertion.

24

25 102. In response to these comments, the County acknowledged that a complete lighting

26 plan has not been provided, but then goes 011 to conclude that it is a less than significant impact

27 "based on the design and specifications of the proposed lighting plau and lighting

28 improvements." (FEIR, p. 3-8.) Such a conclusion is not possible without obtaining and

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 25

analyzing all of the relevant information, and the conclusion is not based upon substantial

2 evidence,

c H. Impacts to Tribal Cultural Resources

103. During the initial stages of the AB 52 consultation process, the County
acknowledged the Tribal Cultural Resources identified by the Tribe, but the County failed to

6 consult with the Tribe regarding the significance of any adverse effects to these resources

7 because the County prematurely terminated the consultation process.

8 VI. The Findings are not based upon substantial evidence

9 104. The findings for the Statement of Overriding Considerations ("SOC") are not

10 supported by substantial evidence. The findings of fact and the CEQA findings are similarly

11 flawed, without substantial evidence to support the conclusions.

12 105. In each of the areas discussed in this Petition, and in areas identified in various

13 comments submitted to the County on the EIR, is there is not substantial evidence to support the

14 conclusions in the document. Further, below are examples of flaws in the findings:

• 15 For impact areas where the EIR did not identify mitigation measures, the County

16 simply did not make any findings. (See Findings and Facts in Support of

17 Findings ['Findings"], p. 4 for Aesthetics; p. 28 for Hydrology and Water
18 Quality; and p. 29 for Land Use.)
19 The Air Quality Findings include all of the errors in the calculations, the improper

20 abandonment of the threshold of significance, and the outdated HRA, and so are
21 faulty. (Findings, pp. 4-6.) Further, Appellants' expert, Dr. Gray, used the
22 updated emissions data from the FEIR and ran a new HRA, providing clear
& evidence that the health risk impacts of the Project are significant.
24 The GHG analysis and findings are flawed for the same reasons. (Findings, pp.

25 24-27.)

.26 The Findings conclude that no contaminated soils exist on the project site, and as

27 noted above, the is evidence is uncertain and does not support this conclusion. "-n•
28 (Findings, p. 28.)
26 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Particularly alarming, substantial evidence does not support the finding that there
4 m tn0p is sufficient water supply for the project. In fact, there is no finding at all on the
question of water supply. (Findings, p. 28 ["None."I)
The Findings regarding noise impacts carry through the errors in the noise studies,
the failure to include the nearest sensitive receptor and other flaws discussed
above, and so they are not based upon substantial evidence. (Findings, pp. 29-
35.)

8 The Findings conclude that the No Project Alternative would not meet any of the
discuss whether or not Crystal Geyser could be 0 9 = 9 m project objectives, but fails to
competitive and meet market demand with the expansion of another of its
facilities or with an off-site option. (Findings, p. 48.)
will have overriding economic The SOC inaccurately finds that the project
benefits simply because the project may create up to 60 jobs over a period of
14 several ycars at the bottling plant. (Findings, p. 51.) There is no evidence cited,

15 and the economic studies prepared for Crystal Geyser fail to take into account the

16 context (whether 60 jobs is significant), and it also fails to take into account the

17 large volume of groundwater that will strain the sewer treatment capacity and
18 impact the public, the groundwater impacts associated with past plant operation,

19 and the reduction in property values as a result of the noise, traffic, and aesthetic
bones conclusion without citation or discussion 20 impacts. The Findings are a bare

21 of any substantial evidence.

22 Finally, the SOC includes a statement that the project's impacts are mitigated and

23 that is an overriding consideration. (Findings, p. 51.) This is not an overriding
consideration, it is a requirement of CEQA. But for the proposed project, the 24

25 mitigation measures would not be necessary. This SOC makes no sense.

26 VII. Other CEQA violations:

27 106. Because tlie County improperly described the CHQA "project" as something other

27 28 than the caretaker's residence Permit being considered the public and decision makers were
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

mislead by the EIR, the County improperly acted as the lead agency for the "project", the
N mitigation measures included in the EIR are unenforceable, and every impact analysis based

0  AI upon an assumption of a particular level of production at the Plant is unreliable because the
County claims to have no authority to limit production in any way.
107. Respondents inappropriately deferred the performance of necessary
investigations, studies or inquiry with respect to the development of mitigation measures and
provided no performance standards, criteria or specific guidance with respect to future studies

8 used to develop mitigation measures. Much of the deferral resulted from a reliance on the

9 notion that responsible agencies would conduct necessary analysis in the future, and hopefully

10 develop mitigation measures. This deferral violates CBQA.

11 108. CEQA requires that the County take into consideration this inconsistency with

12 applicable general plans, and this is a significant impact under CEQA and must be mitigated,

13 and alternatives to the Project as proposed must be considered in order to reduce the impacts.

[4 In the preparation of the EIR for the Project, the County failed to consider the conflicts with

15 the applicable General Plans as potentially significant impacts.

16 109. As a result of Respondents' failure to comply with the procedures required by

17 CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, a preemptory writ of mandate must issue ordering

18 Respondents to set aside its environmental findings and the related decision, and directing

I9 Respondents to comply with the procedures mandated by CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines

20 before acting on any development proposal under the Project.

21 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

22 Violation of General Flan Laws - Government Code $8 65300 et seq.;

23 Code of Civil Procedure 1085

24 110. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 109.

25 111: Respondent County of Siskiyou must ensure that the Project approval is

26 consistent with the statement of policies in the County General Plan and any other applicable

27 planning document.

28
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 28

1 112. As discussed in detail above and in letters submitted by commenters during the
N mvro administrative review process, the Project will not be consistent with the surrounding land uses

and will be harmful to the citizens of both the County and the City, in violation of their
respective General Plans.
113. CEQA requires that the County take into consideration this inconsistency with
applicable general plans, and this is a significant impact under CEQA and must be mitigated,
[ and alternatives to the Project as proposed must be considered in order to reduce the impacts.
00 114. The Final BIR also found that the Project will result in noise impacts to at least

9 one residence that conflicts with the General Plan noise standards and that mitigation of this

are 10 impact is "infcasible" and so it would remain significant and unavoidable. There

11 mitigation measures that could be considered, including a reduction in the size of the plant in

12 order to reduce traffic and its associated noise. Failing to disclose this land use conflict is a

13 violation of CBQA on its own, and it is also a violation of the State a Planning Laws. The

14 County may not approve a project that violates general plan policy that is fundamental;
mandatory, and clear. The Project violates a clear, mandatory noise standard. 15

16 115. The County may not simply note the "unavoidable" impact and move on. The

17 Project is inconsistent with the surrounding community and this must be disclosed and

18 modification of the Project proposal must be undertaken in order to become consistent with the

19 applicable General Plans.

20 116. In response to comments regarding General Plan consistency, the County

21 provided a Master Response so vague that it does not address any of the concerns raised.

22 (Final EIR, p. 3-42.) The Project will not be consistent with the surrounding land uses and will

23 be harmful to the citizens of both the County and the City, in violation of their respective

24 General Plans.

25 117. The Final EIR did not even attempt to remedy the shortcomings of the Draft EIR

26 with respect to General Plan consistency. For example, at page 2 of the proposed Findings, it

27 is noted that Policy 41.3(c) applies, providing that "[ajll heavy commercial and heavy

28 industrial uses should be located away from areas clearly committed to residential uses." The
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 29

Findings do not even address this Policy, but merely conclude that there is no woodland

2 potential where the proposed caretaker's residence will be located. (Findings, p. 2.)
0 7n 118. Employing the continued fiction regarding the Project merely consisting of a
caretaker's residence, the proposed Findings go on to apply Policy 41.3(e), concluding that the
caretaker's residence is compatible with surrounding residential uses, ignoring the remainder of

6 the Project and its industrial activities. (Findings, p. 2.) Policy 41.6 is applied in a similar

7 manner. (Findings, p. 3.) The Findings contain a series of unsupported conclusions regarding

8 consistency with General Plan Policies. The Project is inconsistent with the Siskiyou County
Q General Plan and approval would violate the State Planning and Zoning Law

10 119. Approval of the Project in violation of applicable General Plans and without the

11 necessary mitigation measures was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion and a failure to

12 proceed by law.

13 120. Because the Project is inconsistent with the Siskiyou County General Plan and the
City of Mount Shasta General Plan, Respondents' approval of the Project violated State 14

15 Planning and Zoning Law and must be set aside.
PRAYER 16

17 Wherefore, Petitioners respectfully request the following relief and entry of judgment as

18 follows:

19 1. For alternative and peremptory writs of mnandate directing Respondents to vacate

20 and set aside the certification of the EIR and approval of the Project and to withdraw the

21 Notice of Determination for the Project;

22 2. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing the County to comply

23 with CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, and the State Planning and Zoning Law, and to take any
