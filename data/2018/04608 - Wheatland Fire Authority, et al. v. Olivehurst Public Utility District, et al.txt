1 Petitioners and Plaintiffs Wheatland Fire Authority and Plumas-Brophy Fire Protection

2 District (collectively "Petitioners") petition this Court to issue a Writ of Mandate pursuant to

3 Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5 and submit this complaint for declaratory and

4 injunctive relief against Respondent and Defendant Olivehurst Public Utility District, its Board of
Directors (collectively "OPUD") and Does 1 through 20.

6 INTRODUCTION

7 1. OPUD provides various public services within its service area, including water,

8 wastewater and parks and recreation. OPUD also provides fire and emergency medical services

9 within a portion of its service area.

10 2. The Wheatland Fire Authority provides fire and emergency medical services

11 within the jurisdiction of its member agencies, the City of Wheatland and the Plumas-Brophy Fire

12 Protection District.

13 3. On or about April 19, 2018, OPUD approved a memorandum of understanding

14 ("MOU") with the Estom Yumeka Maidu Tribe of the Enterprise Rancheria ("Tribe") to provide

15 fire and emergency medical services to property ("Property") held by the United States of

16 America in trust for the Tribe on which the Tribe intends to construct and operate a gaming

17 facility and hotel.

18 4. The Property is located within the exclusive service area of the Plumas-Brophy

19 Fire Protection District (and therefore the Wheatland Fire Authority).

20 5. OPUD has exceeded its legal authority under California law by entering into the

21 MOU as OPUD has no authority to provide fire and emergency medical services outside of its
22 service area and within the exclusive service area of Plumas-Brophy Fire Protection District (and

23 therefore the Wheatland Fire Authority). Moreover, OPUD failed to obtain the consent of

24 Plumas-Brophy Fire Protection District and approval from the Yuba County Local Agency

25 Formation Commission ("LAFCO") prior to entering into the MOU as required by Government
26 Code section 56133, applicable LAFCO regulations and Public Utilities Code section 16463.5(b).

27 Finally, OPUD failed to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"),

28 Public Resources Code, §§ 21000 et seq., when approving the MOU.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE / COMPLAINT

1 this suit to OPUD (attached hereto as Exhibit A), and concurrently filing a request concerning

2 preparation of the record of administrative proceedings; and have exhausted any and all available

3 administrative remedies to the extent required by law and to the extent feasible,

4 14. This lawsuit has been commenced within the time limits imposed for this action

5 under the Code of Civil Procedure and the Public Resources Code.

6 15. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary

7 law unless this Court grants the requested relief. In the absence of such remedies, the MOU shall

10 FACTUAL BACKGROUND
11 16. On or about December 17, 2002, the Tribe and the County of Yuba ("County")
12 entered into a Memorandum of Understanding ("County MOU") regarding the Tribe's acquisition
13 of the Property and desires to construct a gaming facility and hotel. Section 5 of the County
14 MOU states:

15 5. Fire and Emergency Medical Services
16 The Tribe agrees that prior to the opening to the public of any
17 facility located on the Property, it will enter into a binding agreement with the Plumas-Brophy Fire Protection District or
18 another fire protection district located within the County of Yuba, or will make other private arrangements in lieu of an agreement
19 with an existing fire protection district, for the provision of fire and emergency medical services arising out of the operation of the
20 Tribe's business operations on the Property. This fire district agreement or other private arrangement will insure that there is an
21 adequate level of fire protection and emergency service available in accordance with any and all federal, state and/or local standards
22 applicable. The fire district agreement or other private arrangement described herein shall be subject to the approval of
23 the County, which approval shall be required prior to opening of any facility located on the Property to the public. The County's
24 approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

25 A true and correct copy of the County MOU is attached as Exhibit B and incorporated by this
26 reference.

27 17. The Plumas-Brophy Fire Protection District through the Wheatland Fire Authority

28 has had discussions with the Tribe regarding providing fire and emergency medical service to the

_ 82627.00003131105378.4 . 4.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE / COMPLAINT

Property, and the Plumas-Brophy Fire Protection District through the Wheatland Fire Authority

2 remains willing and able to provide fire and emergency medical service to the Property.

3 However, no agreement has been executed with the Tribe.

4 18. On information and belief, the Tribe has not made any private arrangement for fire
and emergency medical service to the Property.

19. Rather, on or about April 19, 2018, OPUD approved the MOU to provide fire and

7 emergency medical service to the Property. On information and belief, OPUD did not and does
not intend to obtain LAFCO approval of the MOU. A true and correct copy of the MOU

9 considered and approved by OPUD is attached as Exhibit C and incorporated by this reference.
10 20. OPUD's approval of the MOU was a project under CEQA because it was a

I1 discretionary approval of an activity that may cause a direct physical change in the environment,
12 including, but not limited to potentially significant effects 011 air quality, greenhouse gases, land

13 use, noise, public services, and traffic/transportation.

14 21, OPUD did not conduct any CEQA review before approving the MOU, provide

15 notice that a CEQA exemption or other CEQA determination would be made at the April 19,

16 2018 meeting, or file a Notice of Exemption or Notice of Determination after approving the

17 MOU.

18 22. On or about May 8, 2018, the Yuba County Board of Supervisors approved the

19 MOU pursuant to the provisions of Section 5 of the County MOU.

20 23, On or about May 17, 2018, OPUD approved receiving initial mitigation impact

21 fees for fire and emergency medical service from the Tribe in the amount of $36,000.
22 24. On information and belief, OPUD has begun to or will begin providing fire and
23 emergency medical services to the Property once requested by the Tribe.

24 25. LAFCO is charged with periodically reviewing each municipality and special

25 district within Yuba County, and determining the sphere of influence of that municipality and

26 district, which includes setting its boundaries and establishing which services the municipality or
27 district may provide within its boundaries.

28 ///

82627.00003131105378.4 5 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE / COMPLAINT

26. LAFCO has established spheres of influence and service areas for the Plumas-
2 Brophy Fire Protection District and OPUD.

27. The Property is located within the exclusive service area of the Plumas-Brophy
Fire Protection District (and therefore the Wheatland Fire Authority), and the Plumas-Brophy Fire
Protection District (and therefore the Wheatland Fire Authority) is the exclusive service provider
6 for fire and emergency medical services within its service area.
7 28. OPUD has no authority to provide fire and emergency medical services to the
8 Property or any other Property outside of its. service area, except as permitted by Government
9 Code section 56133 or other applicable law. Subject to inapplicable exceptions, Government
10 Code section 56133 requires LAFCO approval prior to approving any agreement to provide fire
11 and emergency medical services outside of an agency's service area.
12 29. OPUD failed to obtain LAFCO approval prior to approving the MOU. On
13 information and belief, OPUD has not and does not intend to obtain LAFCO approval to provide
14 services to the Property,
15 30. On information and belief, OPUD has not and does not intend to request that
16 LAFCO modify the service areas of OPUD and the Plumas-Brophy Fire Protection District (and
17 therefore the Wheatland Fire Authority) to exclude the Property from Plumas-Brophy Fire
18 Protection District's service area and include the Property in OPUD's service area.
19 31. Petitioners notified OPUD of its inability to provide fire and emergency medical
20 services to the Property. Plumas-Brophy Fire Protection District has not consented to allowing
21 OPUD to provide fire protection services to the Property.
22 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

23 (Petition for Writ of Mandate [Code Civ. Proc., § 1085] - Violation of Government Code,
24 §§ 56133, 56378, 56425; Pub. Util. Code, § 16463.5 - Proceeding Without or in Excess of
25 Jurisdiction)

26 32. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate the allegations contained in Paragraphs
27 through 31, inclusive.

28 ///

82627.00003\31105378.4 - 6 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE /COMPLAINT

I 33. OPUD has also acted without, or in excess of, its jurisdiction because OPUD has

2 no legal authority to provide fire and emergency medical services outside of its service area.
LAFCO, as the California Legislature's "watchdog" over municipality and special district
organization, determines which services a special district may provide in order to ensure that
there is no "wasteful duplication of services." (Bookout v. Local Agency Formation Com. (1975)
49 Cal.App.3d. 383, 388; Gov. Code, §§ 56378, 56425.) Morcover, any agency wishing to
7 provide services outside of its service area by contract or agreement must obtain LAFCO'S

8 authority to do so. (Gov. Code, § 56133.) Section IV.E of LAFCO's Policies, Standards and
9 Procedures implement section 56133, and this section requires LAFCO approval of any
10 agreement subject to section 56133. It further provides that any agreement executed in violation
11 of section 56133 is "null and void." (LAFCO Policies, Standards and Procedures, § IV.E.1.b(4).)
12 34. In addition, Public Utility Code section 16463.5(b) provides, "[i]f the district
13 includes any part of a local agency which provides fire protection service to any territory in the
14 district, the district shall have no authority regarding the prevention and suppression of fires in
15 that territory, unless the district has obtained the consent of the local agency."
16 35. LAFCO has authorized Plumas-Brophy Fire Protection District (and therefore the
17 Wheatland Fire Authority) to provide fire and emergency medical services within its service area.
18 This area includes the Property. Subject to inapplicable exceptions, Plumas-Brophy Fire
19 Protection District (and therefore the Wheatland Fire Authority) has the exclusive authority to
20 provide fire and medical emergency services within its service area. (See Health & Saf. Code,
21 con 13862; Home Gardens Sanitary Dist. v. City of Corona (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 88.)
22 36. LAFCO has authorized OPUD to provide fire and emergency medical services to a
23 portion of its service area. This area does not include the Property.
24 37. LAFCO has not authorized OPUD to provide fire and emergency medical services
25 to the Property.

26 38. Plumas-Brophy Fire Protection District has not consented to allowing OPUD to

27 provide fire protection services to the Property, property within Plumas-Brophy Fire Protection
28 District's fire protection service area, as required by Public Utilities Code section 16463.5(b).

82627.00003131 105378.4 - 7-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE /COMPLAINT

39. By committing itself to provide fire and emergency medical services to the

2 Property in the MOU, OPUD has acted outside of, or without, jurisdiction granted by LAFCO
3 and in violation of Public Utility Code section 16463.5(b) and other applicable law. For this
† nn reason, this Court should issue a preemptory writ of mandate, directing OPUD to either obtain the
consent of Plumas-Brophy Fire Protection District and necessary LAFCO approval or cease

6 providing service to the Property.
00 N SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

(Petition for Writ of Mandate [Code Civ. Proc., § 1085| - Violation of Government Code,
§ 61333; Pub. Util. Code, § 16463.5 - Failure to Perform Ministerial Duty

10 40. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate the allegations contained in Paragraphs
11 through 39, inclusive.

12 41. Government Code section 56133 and other applicable law requires OPUD to
13 obtain LAFCO approval prior to executing any agreement to provide fire and emergency medical

14 services outside of its service area.

15 42. In addition, Public Utility Code section 16463.5(b) provides, "[i]f the district

16 includes any part of a local agency which provides fire protection service to any territory in the
17 district, the district shall have no authority regarding the prevention and suppression of fires in

18 that territory, unless the district has obtained the consent of the local agency."

19 43. The Property is located outside of OPUD's service area.

20 44. OPUD has not obtained LAFCO approval for the MOU or for otherwise providing

21 fire and emergency medical services to the Property.

22 45. Plumas-Brophy Fire Protection District (and therefore the Wheatland Fire

Ar 23 Authority) provides fire and emergency medical services within its service area. This area

24 includes the Property.

25 46. OPUD has not obtained the consent of the Plumas-Brophy Fire Protection District

26 to provide fire protection services to the Property, property within Plumas-Brophy Fire Protection
27 District's fire protection service area, as required by Public Utility Code section 16463.5(b).

28 47. In order to provide fire and emergency medical services to the Property, OPUD

82627.00003 31105378.4 - 8 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE /COMPLAINT

must obtain the approval of LAFCO and consent of the Plumas-Brophy Fire Protection District.

2 OPUD's failure to do so is a failure to execute a clear, present and mandatory duty. OPUD has

3 therefore failed to perform a ministerial duty. For this reason, this Court should issue a

4 preemptory writ of mandate, directing OPUD to either obtain the consent of Plumas-Brophy Fire

5 Protection District and necessary LAFCO approval or cease providing service to the Property.

6 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

7 (Violation of CEQA-Illegal CEQA Action [Public Resources Code, § 21168.5]
8 48. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate the allegations contained in Paragraphs

9 through 47, inclusive.

10 49. The primary goal of CEQA is to "[e]nsure that the long-term protection of the
11 environment shall be the guiding criterion in public decisions." (Public Resources Code,
12 § 21001(d).)

13 50. OPUD's approval of the MOU, which extends fire and emergency medical
14 services outside OPUD's service area, was discretionary action and constituted a project that
15 was subject to CEQA. (Public Resources Code, § 21065; 14 Cal. Code of Regs., § 15378.)
16 51. OPUD's failure to conduct any CEQA review before approving the MOU to
17 provide fire and emergency medical services outside OPUD's service area constituted a
18 prejudicial abuse of discretion for failure to proceed in a manner required by law. (Public
19 Resources Code, 21168.5.)

20 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

21 (Declaratory Relief)
22 52. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate the allegations contained in Paragraphs
23 1 through 51, inclusive.

24 53. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between OPUD and the

25 Petitioners, in that the Petitioners contend, and OPUD disputes, that OPUD lacks the ability to
26 provide fire and emergency medical services to the Property without the approval of LAFCO and
27 consent of Plumas-Brophy Fire Protection District.

28 54. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between OPUD and the

82627.000031\31105378.4 - 9-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE / COMPLAINT

-

2 Petitioners, in that the Petitioners contend, and OPUD disputes, that the MOU is illegal, void, and

3 ultra vires because the City is informed and believes and thereon alleges that OPUD is not, and

4 was not, authorized to execute the MOU and provide fire and emergency medical services to the
Property,

5 55.

6 The Petitioners seek a declaration of the rights and duties of the respective parties

7 regarding the actual and existing controversies described in paragraphs 53 through 54 above.

56.

8 A judicial determination of the rights and obligations of the parties hereto is

9 necessary and appropriate so that the parties may ascertain those rights and act accordingly.
FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

10 (Injunctive Relief)

11 57.

12 Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate the allegations contained in Paragraphs |
through 56, inclusive.

13 58.

14 Petitioners bring this action because the Petitioners, their residents and staff, and

15 the general public will suffer irreparable injury if OPUD's actions are not immediately set aside.

16 OPUD has approved the MOU and committed to providing fire and emergency medical services

17 to the Property. If OPUD is not immediately enjoined and stayed from taking further actions to

18 carry out the MOU, pending resolution of this lawsuit on its merits, Petitioners, their residents

19 and staff, and the general public will be irreparably harmed and forced to incur considerable

20 environmental and other damage. The public interest warrants the issuance of a writ of mandate,

21 a temporary restraining order and the preliminary and permanent injunctions requested by

Petitioners.

22 59.

23 Petitioners have no adequate remedy at law for the injuries alleged herein in that

24 the Petitioners have exhausted all administrative remedies, and damages cannot compensate for

25 the threat that the MOU poses to Petitioners, their residents and staff, and the general public.
ATTORNEYS' FEES

26 60.

27 Petitioners have had to employ attorneys to bring this litigation. Furthermore, the

28 Petitioners have incurred and will incur substantial attorneys' fees and litigation costs because of
OPUD's unlawful acts. This litigation, if successful, will result in enforcement of important

82627.00003\31105378.4 - 10 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE / COMPLAINT

-

2 rights affecting the public interest. Such enforcement will confer a significant benefit on a large

3 class of persons. Petitioners are entitled to be reimbursed for its attorneys' fees and costs because

4 it is functioning as private attorneys pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.

5 Petitioners are also entitled to attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to Government Code
section 800.

7 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as follows:

8 ON THE FIRST AND SECOND CAUSES OF ACTION

9 1.

Re: Enterprise Rancheria Trust Application

Dear Secretary Norton:

On (insert date of Board action) the County of Yuba, through its Board of Supervisors, entered into a formal binding Memorandum of Understanding with Enterprise Rancheria, a federally recognized Indian tribe, regarding the Tribe's application for trust acquisition of a 40-acre parcel of land within the County, Enterprise Rancheria seeks to have the land taken into trust for gaming purposes consistent with the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C. § 2701, et seq. The County has found that the Tribe's proposed uses of the property which is the subject of the trust application are consistent and compatible with the County's general plan and the zoning of the property.
The County and the Tribe negotiated in good faith over a period of months to arrive at the Memorandum of Understanding, and have arrived at an agreement which more than adequately mitigates all anticipated impacts of the proposed development. The Memorandum of Understanding will compensate the County for the loss of tax revenues resulting from the anticipated trust acquisition and provide revenue to support public services to the property, In addition, the agreement creates a framework for government- to-govemment cooperation, ensuring the public health, safety and welfare of the public ES well as of the Tribe's employees.
The Board of Supervisors of Yuba County has determined that a resort hotel and gaming establishment on the subject property would be in the best interest of, and not detrimental to, the surrounding community and Yuba County as a whole. We therefore respectfully request that you approve the application of Enterprise Rancheria to have the subject parcel taken into trust status for the benefit of the Tribe, for gaming purposes.
Very truly yours,

COUNTY OF YUBA

OAK #4831-8103-5107 v2 9

consumables.

iv, Operations Period Adjustments.

On an annual basis, the parties shall adjust the estimated numbers of Fire Services Calls and Emergency Medical Services Calls and the estimated Per-Fire Services Call Amount and Per-Emergency Medical Services Call Amount for the upcoming calendar year period based on actual Project operations and experience, together with the anticipated increase, if any, of patronage to the Project, The estimated Per-Fire Services Call Amount and Per-Emergency Medical Services Call Amount shall increase each year by at least the corresponding increase to the Consumer Price Index for Sacramento, California, as issued by US Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics, or successor index.

performing any fire or emergency medical services for the Tribe.
(d) Impact Fees.

Based on the currently antipated Project as a 50,000 square foot Light Load Commercial building constructed with sprinklers, and OPUD's current FMF rates of $0.72 per sq. foot, the Tribe's current FMF obligation is Thirty Six Thousand ($36,000.00) Dollars. The Tribe will pay this amount in four in quarterly payments of Nine Thousand ($9,000.00) with the first payment due ninety days after commencement of casino operations at the Project. The Tribe will pay all other FMF's within 30 days of commencement of applicable construction or, if applicable, at the time of building permit
issuance.

5, Special Events and Additional District Standby Costs.

(a) General. As proper planning for Special Events may require the District to maintain additional standby personnel and equipment, and the costs of such additional resources may not be taken into account in determining Per-Emergency
Medical Services Call Amour and Per-Fire Services Call Amounts, this Section contains the parties' additional rights and obligations regarding Special Events at

OAK #4831-B103-5107 v2 10

the Yuba Site. Nothing in this Section will alter or adjust the actual amounts payable for an Emergency Medical Services Call Amount and Per-Fire Services Call Amount, including in connection with Special Event.

(b) Procedures. The Tribe (or designee) will give reasonable advance notice (generally at least five calendar days, but more if reasonably available) to an OPUD email address or facsimile number designated by OPUD's Fire Chief from time to time of (i) any Special Event, and (ii) the anticipated additional number of attendees or participants. As promptly as reasonably possible thereafter (generally within 48 hours), OPUD will respond (to the sending email address or facsimile number, or as otherwise identified in the Tribe's notice) with (x) an identification of OPUD's recommended additional standby personnel, equipment
and other resources for the Special Event, and (y) the itemized costs thereof. As promptly as reasonably possible thereafter (generally within 24 hours), the Tribe (or designee) will respond (in the same manner as its original notice to OPUD, unless otherwise requested in the OPUD proposal) with an approval or rejection of the recommendation. Alternatively, the parties may negotiate the terms of any
proposal until mutually approved,

(c) Payment for Approved Special Event Standby Resources. The Tribe will pay the
amounts identified on an approved Special Events proposal within 10-days of the Tribe's approval. To avoid double payments, OPUD's additional standby costs in connection with approved Special Events proposals will not be taken into account in determining Per-Emergency Medical Services Call Amounts and Per-Fire Services Call Amounts (although OPUD's regular standby costs, and costs for any actual Special Event Emergency Medical Services Call or Fire Services Call, will be included).
(d) OPUD's Use of Standby Resources. OPUD will use good faith efforts to reserve any additional approved Special Events standby resources for the Special Event, and will use them for other Emergency Medical Services Calls or Fire Services Calls only if otherwise required by California law including, without limitation, availability, first-come first served, non-discrimination, and Mutual Aid.

6. Funding Mechanism.
This MOU only creates a funding mechanism for the provision of fire and emergency medical services and related plan check and inspection services for the Facility. The District acknowledges and agrees that the District does not exercise jurisdiction over the Yuba Site or have legal authority to deliberate on, approve, deny, or otherwise exercise judgment over any aspect of the Facility, including without limitation the Tribe's gaming operations. The Tribe represents that this MOU is not a "management contract" as defined in IGRA, Further, nothing in this MOU contemplates or commits the District to any project which may result in a potentially significant physical impact on the environment.
