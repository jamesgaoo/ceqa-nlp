4 Declaration ("MND").

5 2. The City violated the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA"), Pub. Res. Code ยง

6 21000, et seq., in several respects. Among other things, the City failed to adequately consider the
7 environmental impacts associated with the Project, failed to prepare and circulate required

9 violates and is inconsistent with the City's General Plan and Municipal Code and with the State

10 Subdivision Map Act.

11 3. Petitioner seeks alternative and peremptory writs of mandate declaring the City's approvals

12 invalid, and enjoining the City from taking steps to implement the approvals.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND HISTORY

10 9. The 8.74 net-acre Project site is comprised of two parcels, located at the southeast corner of

11 Stetson and Sanderson Avenues in the City of Hemet. The site currently includes the existing

12 McCrometer industrial facility and associated parking is located to the west of the site, while the

13 casterly portion is currently vacant but was previously used as a single family residence.

19 located to the west of the site.

20 12. The Project includes Tentative Parcel Map 37421 to subdivide the site into four lots. Parcel

Concerned Citizens of Hemet v. City of Hemet Page 3
Writ Petition

1 14. The City prepared the MND regarding the Project. The MND was circulated for public

2 comment between March 26 and April 14, 2018. The MND concluded that there would not be any

3 significant impact associated with approval and implementation of the Project. Comment letters were

4 submitted objecting to the MND.

5 15. During the course of consideration of the Project and MND, numerous comments were

6 received by the City, including from area residents and Petitioner's members.

7 16. Comments noted several problems with the City's analysis and its failure to prepare an

8 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"), including, but not limited to, that the Project would lead to

9 aesthetic and land use impacts, that the Project is inconsistent with the General Plan and Municipal

10 Code, that the Project would lead to significant cumulative impacts, that the Project would lead to

11 significant air quality impacts, that the Project would lead to significant impacts to soils and geology,

12 that the Project would lead to significant impacts to greenhouse gas emissions, that the Project would

13 lead to significant noise impacts, that the Project will lead to significant impacts to public services, that

14 the Project will lead to significant water supply impacts, that the traffic analysis did not account for all
15 likely traffic, that the analysis failed to consider significant impacts associated with construction traffic,

16 that there are failing roadways and intersections but the Project will not be providing mitigation to address

17 these impacts, that the traffic analysis did not realistically consider existing poor circulation conditions,

18 that the Project will lead to significant traffic impacts, that the Project would lead to significant

19 impacts to traffic, pedestrian and bicycle safety, that the Project would lead to significant socio-

20 economic impacts and blight, that the Project did not propose to mitigate all of its impacts, that the
21 Project would exacerbate existing bad conditions, and that the Project is inconsistent with community

22 character.

23 17. Comments also noted ways in which the Project violated the General Plan and Municipal

24 Code, including failing to provide transitional uses between commercial uses and single family uses,

25 failing to buffer different land uses through buffers, setbacks, edge treatments, site design, landscaping

26 and building scale and orientation, entailing incompatible uses and adversely affecting safety and

27 residential character, failing to promote reuse and infill development "consistent with surrounding uses

28 and the needs of the community," failing to maintain and enhance property values, failing to provide high-

Concerned Citizens of Hemet v. City of Hemet Page 4
Writ Petition

1 quality goods and services, failing to appropriately control the location, concentration and number of

2 alcohol sales and tobacco products to prevent adverse impacts to residences, schools and parks, failing to

3 provide for siting and building design to minimize noise, failing to protect noise-sensitive nearby

4 residential uses, being unsuitable for the type of development, will be detrimental to the public health,

5 safety and welfare, will be materially injurious to properties and improvements in the vicinity, is not

6 consistent with General Plan elements, goals and policies, is not an appropriate type or intensity of uses

7 that will be compatible with existing land uses and the character of established neighborhoods, is likely to

8 cause public health problems, would put alcohol sales will be immediately adjacent to residential uses,

9 will be detrimental to surrounding properties and neighborhoods, including contributing to loitering,

10 public drunkenness, noise, parking, crime, and defacement and damage to structures, will adversely

11 impact the suitability of adjacent commercial zoned properties, will directly adjoin residential uses where

12 homes front on the street and substantial buffering and setbacks is not provided, will result in effects of

13 nuisance activity, light, glare, noise and emissions that will impact adjacent residences, and will fail to be
14 adequately integrated or otherwise compliant with applicable design standards, and does not meet setback
15 requirements.

16 18. Comments also noted that in a comparable situation, in approving Resolution Bill No. 14-

17 019, the City's Planning Commission denied a conditional use permit to upgrade from a Type 20 to a a

18 Type 21 license, claiming, among other things, it had the "potential to increase nuisance and criminal

19 behavior" and citing a "concentration of alcohol uses and sales."

20 19. Comments also noted the Community Development Director had failed to make a

21 determination that the use would meet the objectives of the zone and that the use and its operation are
22 compatible with uses permitted in the zone in the manner required by the Municipal Code.

23 20. Comments also noted that City staff had misrepresented the Municipal Code and the City's

24 obligations.

25 21. Comments also noted that the City had failed to provide for adequate public involvement

26 and public information.

27 22. Comments also noted that the proposed resolutions failed to produce adequate findings

28 supported by evidence and that the proposed findings were inadequately supported.

Concerned Citizens of Hemet v. City of Hemet Writ Petition Page 5

1 23. On April 17 and May 15, 2018, the City's Planning Commission held hearings regarding

2 the Project and MND. Numerous comments were received, orally and in writing, in opposition to the

3 Project and MND, including comments from Petitioner's representatives. After receiving public

4 testimony, the Planning Commission voted to approve the Project and MND. Approvals included

5 adoption of Resolutions Nos. 18-012, 18-013, and 18-014.

6 24. On May 24, 2018, Petitioner filed a timely appeal of the Planning Commission's approvals.

7 25. On May 30, 2018, Petitioner made a request to City Community Development Director

8 Deanna Elliano and City Senior Planner Carole Kendrick for access to all records related to the Project

9 and associated MND. Petitioner's request specifically referenced the Public Records Act and

10 identified the categories of documents Petitioner sought.

11 26. In a June 11, 2018 response, the City Clerk's Office responded to Petitioner's request and

12 claimed that several records would be assembled and made available but that that for certain categories of

13 requested records, only such records identified as non-exempt would be produced. Additionally, City

14 claimed that it had identified over two-thousand (2,000) pages from City's e-mail servers as possibly

15 responsive to Petitioner's request and that City would "cxamine these records and determine which are in

16 fact responsive to your request and if any exemptions apply." The letter from the City Clerk stated: "The

17 City will provide you with a determination by June 25, 2018."

18 27. In a June 15, 2018 letter, Petitioner responded noting that, amongst other things, the Public

19 Records Act requires the City to "justify withholding any record by demonstrating that the record in

20 question is exempt." Petitioner accordingly requested City provide an adequate showing for any assertion
21 of exemption and specific description of any withheld document and the specific basis for such

22 withholding.

23 28. On June 21, 2018, City provided copies of certain records requested by Petitioner.

24 However, the City did not produce any of the e-mails it stated it would be reviewing, nor did it provide

25 any determination of whether any exemptions apply.

26 29. On June 26, 2018, Ms. Elliano informed Petitioner that due to the volume of materials for

27 the matter, the City Attorney and staff would be recommending the hearing be scheduled for the July

28

Concerned Citizens of Hemet v. City of Hemet Page 6
Writ Petition

1 24, 2018 City Council meeting. Additionally, the City requested that all materials for the July 24,

2 2018 meeting be submitted no later than July 17, 2018.

3 30. In a series of e-mails between Petitioner and Ms. Elliano dated June 28, 2018, Petitioner

4 requested that the City provide "all records responsive to our request no later than July 3rd3s to provide

5 time to consider such records and the extent the record may be relevant to any comments Petitioner

6 would submit by City's deadline of Tuesday, July 17, 2018. Ms. Elliano responded that due to the

7 volume of e-mails identified by City, City anticipated transmitting any responsive e-mail records by

8 Friday, July 13, 2018 or carlier to the extent possible.

9 31. In a June 29, 2018 e-mail, Petitioner informed Ms. Elliano that, in addition to the e-mail

10 records not yet received, the City had failed to provide Petitioner with adequate showing for any

11 assertion of exemption.

12 32. Having not received any responsive emails, Petitioner was forced to a case under the Public

13 Records Act. Despite the filing of the litigation, the City withheld and refused to produce numerous

14 records prior to the City Council hearing.

15 33. In July 17, 2018 letter to the City Council, Petitioner informed the City that its failure to

16 produce relevant records was hampering Petitioner's ability to participate in the process and present its

17 concerns to the City.

18 34. On July 24, 2018, the City Council met to consider the Project and MND. Numerous

19 comments were received, orally and in writing, in opposition to the Project and MND, including

20 comments from Petitioner's representatives. After receiving public testimony, the City Council voted
21 to approve the Project and MND. Approvals included adoption of Resolution No. 18-046 upholding

22 the Planning Commission approvals and denying the appeal of the Project and MND.

23 35. A Notice of Determination was filed by the City on July 25, 2018.

24 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

25 AND INADEQUATE REMEDIES AT LAW

26 36. Petitioner has exhausted all available administrative remedies, and objections to the Project

27 have been presented orally and in writing to the City, as required by Public Resources Code Section

13 mandate requiring the City to set aside its approval of the Project and the FEIR. In the absence of such

14 remedy, the City's approvals will remain in effect in violation of State law, and Petitioner will suffer
