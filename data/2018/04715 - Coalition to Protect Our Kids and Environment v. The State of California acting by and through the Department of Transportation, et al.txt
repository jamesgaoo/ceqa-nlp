19 INTRODUCTION

20 Petitioner COALITION TO PROTECT OUR KIDS AND ENVIRONMENT
21 ("Petitioner") alleges as follows:

22 1. Petitioner brings this action against the State of California, acting by and through
23 the Department of Transportation ("Caltrans") for its approval of the State Route 133
24 Improvement Project ("Project") and its adoption of a Mitigated Negative Declaration for the
25 Project. As discussed in the Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Project, Caltrans' Project is
26 proposed to piece together sub-projects Caltrans previously isolated from each other, including
27 what Caltrans referred to as the State Route 133 Safety Project ("Safety Project"). Despite the
28 fact that the Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Project discussed that the Project included

2547982.2

the Safety Project piece, after the filing of this Petition, Petitioner learned that Caltrans now
2 contends that the so-called Safety Project is a separate piece. Petitioner is informed and
3 believes, and based thereon alleges, that in addition to the approval of the Project and adoption
4 of a Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Project, Caltrans separately (and improperly)
5 adopted addenda to a previously adopted Mitigated Negative Declaration ("Addenda") for the
6 Safety Project that Caltrans did not circulate for public review. Hereafter, the term "Project"
7 includes the Safety Project.

8 2. Petitioner contends that Caltrans erred in approving the Project, adopting the
9 Mitigated Negative Declaration, and adopting the Addenda and violated provisions of the
10 California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code §§ 21000, et seq., "CEQA") and
11 the Guidelines for Implementation of CEQA (Tit. 14, Cal. Code Regs., §§ 15000 et seq.: the
12 "Guidelines").

13 3. Caltrans' approval of the Project, the Mitigated Negative Declaration, and
14 Addenda are being challenged because (among other things) it is a project that results in
15 significant impacts on the environment that have not been adequately assessed or mitigated in
16 accordance with CEQA and the Guidelines. Caltrans ignored substantial evidence that
17 significant unmitigated impacts would result from the Project. Despite the magnitude of the
18 impacts as a result of the Project, Caltrans failed to analyze and mitigate the Project's
19 environmental impacts. In violation of CEQA, the Mitigated Negative Declaration and
20 Addenda prepared by Caltrans do not adequately consider project alternatives. Additionally,
21 the Project would have various significant impacts to noise, water quality, drainage, traffic, air
22 quality, greenhouse gas emissions, geology/soils, biological resources, aesthetics, land use,
23 among others. Caltrans further violated CEQA by failing to adequately analyze and mitigate
24 these significant impacts in its Mitigated Negative Declaration and Addenda. Rather than
25 objectively enforceable mitigation measures, Caltrans listed further conduct it may undertake
26 in its future discretion.

27 4. In failing and refusing to prepare and certify a legally adequate EIR that fairly,
28 fully and honestly disclosed and analyzed the potential impacts that will result from the

Palmiori, Tyler, Wiener -2-
Wilhelm & Waldron LLP
Altorneys at Law FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
2547982.2

1 Project, refusing to consider and adopt entirely feasible and environmentally superior

2 alternatives to the Project, failing to require adequate mitigation measures, those mitigation
3 measures that were included Caltrans failed to make fully enforceable, Caltrans has
4 disregarded the specific and substantive requirements of CEQA and the Guidelines and abused
5 its discretion and failed to comply with applicable law.

6 5. Petitioner therefore requests a writ of mandate directing Caltrans to withdraw its
7 approval of the Project and its component pieces including, but not limited to the Safety
8 Project, void the inadequate Mitigated Negative Declaration and Addenda, and prepare an

9 environmental impact report ("EIR") so that the Project's full impacts can be disclosed,
10 analyzed and addressed. These claims are based on the following allegations.
11 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

12 6. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to sections 1085, 1094.5 and
13 187 of the Code of Civil Procedure and sections 21168 and/or 21168.5 of the Public Resources
14 Code.

15 7. Venue for this action properly lies in the Orange County Superior Court. The
16 Project is located in Orange County.
17 PARTIES AND BENEFICIAL INTEREST

18 8. Petitioner is an unincorporated association composed of and supported by
19 individuals and groups devoted to the preservation of the environment. Petitioner is a
20 grassroots community group that (among other things) was organized for the purpose of
21 representing the interests of the public in assuring Caltrans' compliance with the State's
22 environmental and land use laws. Members of Petitioner reside, work or recreate within the
23 City of Laguna Beach and/or neighboring cities. On behalf of these and other residents and
24 community stakeholders, Petitioner challenges Caltrans' approval of the Project.
25 9. Petitioner has standing and is a party beneficially interested in the issuance of the
26 requested writ of mandate and injunctive and declaratory relief (i) because in accordance with
27 subdivision (c) of Public Resources Code section 21177, Petitioner is an organization formed
28 after Caltrans' approval of the Project to maintain this action against Caltrans, and (ii) because

Palmiori, Tyler, Wienor -3-
Wilhelm & Waldron |
Attorneys at Law FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
2547982.2

1 certain members of Petitioner complied with subdivisions (a) and (b) of Public Resources Code
2 section 21177 and exhausted their administrative remedies by commenting on and objecting to
3 the Project and the contents and adequacy of the Mitigated Negative Declaration and Addenda.

4 Moreover, unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate, the impacts resulting from
5 the Caltrans decision will extend to areas in which Petitioner's members, supporters and

6 numerous citizens represented by Petitioner live, own property, recreate, own businesses and
7 this Project will affect their living environment.

8 10. Petitioner brings this public interest litigation as a citizen's action, and no matter

9 how any portion of this Petition's allegations or prayer is construed, in no way does Petitioner
10 intend to assert a claim or seek relief herein that is inconsistent with the following parameters:
11 A. Petitioner does not seek any relief greater than or different from the relief
12 sought for the general public or for a class of which Petitioner's members and supporters
13 residing within the geographical jurisdiction of the Project are themselves members.
14 B. By bringing this action, Petitioner secks to enforce important rights
15 affecting the public interest and to confer a significant benefit, whether pecuniary or
16 nonpecuniary, on the general public or a large class of persons.
17 C. Private enforcement is necessary and places a disproportionate financial
18 burden on Petitioner in relating to its stake in this matter.

19 11. Petitioner is informed and believes and based thereon alleges that Caltrans is a
20 state agency under the laws of the State of California and the "lead" agency under CEQA.
21 Caltrans is responsible for managing California's highway system.
22 12. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of the respondents named
23 herein as DOES 1 through 10, inclusive, and therefore sues those respondents by such fictitious
24 names. Petitioner will amend this petition to allege the true names and capacities of those Doe
25 parties when ascertained. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that
26 each of the parties designated herein as a Doe is responsible in some manner for the events and
27 actions referred to herein.

28

Palmiori, Tyler, Wioner -4-
Wilhelm & Waldron LLP
Attorneys at Law FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
2547982.2

1 13. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that at all relevant
2 times Caltrans and the Doe respondents were and are the agents of each other, authorized to do
3 the acts herein alleged, each of which was ratified by the others.

4 14. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, or otherwise of
5 Does through 10 are unknown to Petitioner who therefore sues Does 1 through 10 by such

6 fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this petition to allege the true names and capacities of
7 the Doe respondents when the same becomes known to it. Reference to "Caltrans" or
8 "Respondent" shall mean the named respondents and Does 1 through 10.
15. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that Caltrans and
10 each of the Does proximately caused the acts, omissions to act, and/or injuries herein alleged.
11 16. Caltrans is, and at all times relevant herein has been, charged by law with the
12 performance of all duties arising under CEQA and the Guidelines, including (but not limited
13 to) the preparation and certification of a legally adequate environmental document for the
14 Project.

15 17. Petitioner has exhausted available administrative remedies against the Caltrans'
16 approval of the Project, the Mitigated Negative Declaration and Addenda as being in
17 compliance with CEQA and the Guidelines. The decision of Caltrans to approve the Mitigated
18 Negative Declaration, Addenda and Project is a final determination. If the Court does not
19 grant the relief prayed for herein, Petitioner will suffer irreparable injury for which it has no
20 adequate remedy at law, there will be a waste, and the failure to enjoin further conduct may
21 tend to render the judgment in this action ineffectual.
22 18. Petitioner has previously complied with the requirements of Public Resources
23 Code section 21167.5 by sending, via United States Postal Service First Class Mail, written
24 notice of this action to Caltrans. A copy of the written notice provided to Caltrans with proof
25 of service of same is attached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated herein by this reference.
26 Petitioner has previously complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

1 amended action to Caltrans. A copy of the written notice provided to Caltrans with proof of
2 service of same is attached hereto as Exhibit C and incorporated herein by this reference.
3 19. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
4 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 by furnishing a copy of this Verified Petition
5 for Writ of Mandate to the Attorney General of California. Petitioner will comply with the
6 requirements of Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section
7 388 by furnishing a copy of this First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate to the
8 Attorney General of California.
9 20. Petitioner has timely filed this Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and
10 Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate in accordance with Public Resources Code
11 section 21167 and CEQA Guidelines section 15112.

12 LEGAL BACKGROUND

13 21. The California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code Section
14 I21000 et seq. requires public agencies such as Caltrans to document and thoroughly consider
15 the environmental impacts of their actions. CEQA is intended to fully inform the public and
16 agency decision makers about potential environmental consequences of proposed projects and
17 to ensure informed decision-making by public agencies and officials. CEQA contains
18 procedural, informational, and substantive mandates.

19 22. CEQA applies to discretionary projects carried out or approved by public
20 agencies. (Pub. Resources Code 21080, subd. (a).) CEQA defines "project" as "an activity
21 which may cause either a direct physical change in the environment or a reasonably
22 foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment" including "an activity that involves
23 the issuance of a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement for use by one or more
24 public agencies." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21065.)
25 23. With a limited number of exceptions, it is the responsibility of the lead agency to
26 prepare an EIR for all projects that may havc a significant effect on the environment.
27 Significant effect on the environment means a substantial or potentially substantial adverse
28 change in the environment. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21068.) An EIR is a detailed statement

Palmieri, Tyler, Wiener -6-
Withelm : & Waldron LLP
Altorneys FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
| 2547982.2

1 describing all of the project's significant environmental effects, mitigation measures to
2 minimize these significant effects, and alternatives to the project. (Pub. Resources Code,
3 §§ 21061, 21100.)

4 24. CEQA requires a mandatory finding of significance where (1) the project has the
5 potential to reduce the number or restrict the range of endangered, rare, or threatened species;
6 (2) the project has the potential to achieve short-term environmental goals to the disadvantage
7 of long-term environmental goals; (3) the project impacts may be cumulatively considerable;
8 and/or (4) the environmental effects of the project will cause substantial adverse effects on

o human beings, either directly or indirectly. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15065, subd. (a).)
10 25. The lead agency typically prepares a preliminary report called an "Initial Study"
11 to identify a project's potential environmental effects and to determine whether an EIR must be
12 prepared. (See CEQA Guidelines, § 15365.)
13 26. If the agency determines that the project will not have a significant effect on the
14 environment, it may prepare a "Negative Declaration." A Negative Declaration is a brief
15 written statement that describes the reasons why the proposed project will not have a
16 significant effect on the environment and therefore why an EIR is not required. (Pub.
17 Resources Code, § 21080, subd. (c); CEQA Guidelines, § 15371.) Additionally, a Negative
18 Declaration must contain a description of the proposed project. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15071.)
19 27. The determination that the project will not have a significant impact on the
20 environment can only be made if there is no substantial evidence that the project may have a
21 significant impact in light of the whole record before the lead agency. (Pub. Resources Code,
22 21080, subd. (c)(1).) Whenever substantial evidence in the record supports a "fair argument"
23 that significant effects on the environment may occur, an EIR must be prepared.
24 28. If the Initial Study indicates that a project may have significant environmental
25 effects, a Negative Declaration may be prepared if (1) revisions in the project are made by or
26 agreed to by the applicant before the Initial Study and Negative Declaration are released for
27  public review that would avoid or mitigate these effects to a point where clearly no significant
28 effects on the environment would occur and (2) there is no substantial evidence, in light of the

Palmieri, Tyler, Wioner -7-
Wilholm 4 : Waidron LLP
Altorneys al Law FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
| 2547982.2

1 whole record before the lead agency, that the project as revised may have a significant effect
2 on the environment. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21080, subd. (c)(2).) A Negative Declaration
3 that incorporates mitigation measures to avoid an identified potentially significant
4 environmental effect is known as 1 "Mitigated Negative Declaration." (CEQA Guidelines,
5 § 15369.5.)

6 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

7 The Project's Significant Impacts
8 29. According to Caltrans, the Project proposes to make improvements to State
9 Route 133 in both directions from just south of El Toro Road to SR-73 within a portion of
10 unincorporated Orange County and the City of Laguna Beach. The project will make drainage
11 improvements, widen the shoulders, add a Class a II bike lane and underground overhead
12 utilities. According to Caltrans, the Project also purports to include "safety improvements."
13 30. The Project will induce an increase in overall vehicle travel, leading to
14 greenhouse gas and air quality impacts, among other impacts. A 2015 policy brief on induced
15 travel--linked by Caltrans on its website--and a 2014 California Air Resources Board policy
16 brief explain that increased capacity results in increased travel and emissions.| Specifically,
17 expanded capacity via additional lanes "decreases travel time, in effect lowering the 'price' of
18 driving; and when prices go down, the quantity of driving goes up."2 Meaning, increased
19 capacity on a particular route incentivizes travel, leading to more vehicles on the road. This is
20 particularly the case for State Route 133 which leads to Laguna Beach. Therefore, the Project

1 would induce increased traffic by expanding State Route 133's capacity through additional

2 lanes.

3 31. The Mitigated Negative Declaration, however, contains no analysis of the
4 impacts from induced travel. Caltrans has been criticized in the past for failing to analyze and
5 disclose impacts of induced travel. The parent agency of Caltrans, the California State
6 Transportation Agency, conducted a third party assessment of Caltrans. The review contained

7 a strong critique of Caltrans' "failure to come to grips with the reality of induced traffic and the
8 relationship between transportation and land use."3

0 32. The induced travel from the Project would lead to environmental impacts noise,
10 water quality, drainage, traffic, air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, geology/soils, biological
11 resources, aesthetics, land use, etc. The area around the Project is particularly vulnerable to
12 environmental impacts from additional traffic.

13 Procedural History
14 33. Despite the aforementioned issues with the Project, Caltrans approved the Project
15 and its Mitigated Negative Declaration. Prior to these approvals, Caltrans prepared and
16 circulated a draft of the environmental document containing the Mitigated Negative
17 Declaration.

18 34. The circulated draft, known as the Initial Study with (Proposed) Mitigated
19 Negative Declaration/Environmental Assessment, was circulated for public comment between
20 June 11, 2018 and July 10, 2018. Petitioner's members commented concerning this document.
21 Petitioner's members' comments identified potentially significant environmental effects that
22 had not been mitigated and failures to adequately disclose and analyze environmental effects.
23 The comments included requests that Caltrans prepare an EIR for the Project.
24 35. Despite the comments identifying significant environmental impacts and the
25 need for an EIR, Caltrans approved the Project and its Initial Study with Mitigated Negative

1 Declaration/Environmental Assessment with Finding of No Significant Impact on October 1,
2 2018 and issued a Notice of Determination on October 5, 2018. Attached hereto as Exhibit B
3 and incorporated herein by this reference is a true and correct copy of the Notice of
4 Determination.

5 36. Petitioner is informed and believes and based thereon alleges that on or about
6 June 12, 2018 and September 28, 2018, Caltrans also approved the Addenda. The Addenda
7 was not circulated for public review or otherwise made available for public review and
8 comment prior to the approval by Caltrans. Caltrans' piecemeal approach and piecemeal

9 reaction to this Petition is contrary to the requirements of CEQA, the Guidelines and the
10 underlying policy of public transparency regarding the environmental review. Despite
11| Caltrans' sccret approvals of the Addenda, Petitioner's members commented concerning the
12 Project, which Caltrans represented to the public includes the Safety Project, in response to the
13 Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Project. Petitioner's members' comments identified
14 potentially significant environmental effects that had not been mitigated and failures to
15 adequately disclose and analyze environmental effects. The comments included requests that
16 Caltrans prepare an EIR for the Project. Caltrans did not issue and file a Notice of
17 Determination concerning its approvals of the Addenda.

18 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

19 (Against all Respondents)
20 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

21 37. Petitioner realleges and incorporates, as though fully set forth herein, paragraphs
22 through 36 of this Petition.

23 38. In carrying out its review and approval activities with respect to the Project,
24 Caltrans was, and is at all times mentioned herein, under a mandatory duty to comply with the
25 provisions of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines.

26 39. Caltrans' approval of the Project, the Mitigated Negative Declaration and
27 Addenda constitutes an abuse of discretion in that Respondent failed to proceed in the manner

28

Palmieri, Tylor, Wioner -10-
Wilholm & Waldron LLP Allorneys al Law FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
2547982.2

1 required by law and its decision is not supported by substantial evidence, including (but not
2 limited to) the following:
Failure to Prepare Environmental Impact Report

4 40. An EIR must be prepared if substantial evidence in the record supports a fair
5 argument that a project may have a significant effect on the environment.

6 41. Substantial evidence in the record supports a fair argument that the Project may
7 have a significant effect on the environment. In particular, an EIR is necessary to evaluate the
8 Project's impacts to noise, water quality, drainage, traffic, air quality, greenhouse gas
9 emissions, geology/soils, biological resources, aesthetics, land use, etc.
10 42. The Project has the potential to reduce the number and/or restrict the range of
11 endangered and threatened species, achieve short-term goals to the disadvantage of long-term
12 goals, result in a cumulatively considerable environmental effect, and directly or indirectly
13 cause substantial adverse effects on human beings. Due to these impacts, CEQA demands a
14 mandatory finding of significance and preparation of an EIR.
15 43. A "significant effect on the environment" means a substantial, or potentially
16 substantial, adverse change in any of the physical conditions within the area affected by the
17 project including land, air, water, minerals, flora, fauna, ambient noise, and objects of historic
18 or aesthetic significance. The Project's potential impact to the community required preparation
19 of the EIR.

20 44. CEQA and the Guidelines require that Respondent analyze the Project's
21 potentially significant environmental impacts on land use. Caltrans failed to prepare an EIR by
22 not honestly analyzing the Projects potential to cause adverse environmental impacts.
23 45. Caltrans' failure to prepare an EIR is not supported by substantial evidence and
24 represents a failure to proceed in the manner required by law.

25 Inadequate Analysis of Project's Environmental Effects

26 46. CEQA requires that the Mitigated Negative Declaration provide sufficient
27 analysis to support a finding that the Project would not have a significant effect on the
28 environment. However, the Mitigated Negative Declaration provides inadequate analysis of

Palmiori, Tylor, Wienor -11-
Wilholm & Waldron I
Atlorneys al Law FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
2547982.2

1 the Project's potential environmental effects including impacts to noise, water quality,
2 drainage, traffic, air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, geology/soils, biological resources,
3 aesthetics, land use, etc. Furthermore, in failing to discuss the Project's cumulative impacts,

4 Caltrans' improperly segmented the Project by avoiding analysis of actions connected to the
5 Project.

6 47. Caltrans' inadequate evaluation of the Project's environmental effects is not
7 supported by substantial evidence and represents a failure to proceed in the manner required by
8 law.

9 48. CEQA further requires that all supporting technical materials supporting an
10 environmental document must be available to the reviewing public and responsible agencies.
11 (Pub. Resources Code, § 21103.1 [information relevant to significant effects must be available
12 as soon as possible to general public and other public agencies]; CEQA Guidelines, § 15072,
13 subd. (g)(4).) Petitioner is informed and believes and based thereon alleges that Caltrans either
14 did not have technical reports to support its environmental document, or it did not make such
15 supporting technical information readily available to the public on its website for the Project.
16 Such failure represents a failure to proceed in the manner required by law.
17 Inadequate Mitigation of Significant Environmental Effects

18 49. CEQA and the Guidelines requires that the Mitigated Negative Declaration must
19 include mitigation measures that reduce the Project's identified significant environmental
20 effects to the point where "clearly no significant effects on the environment would occur."
21 Caltrans must adopt feasible mitigation measures to avoid significant environmental impacts.
22 50. The Mitigated Negative Declaration and Addenda, however, do not include
23 mitigation measures sufficient to reduce the Project's significant impacts to noise, water
24 quality, drainage, traffic, air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, geology/soils, biological
25 resources, aesthetics, land use, etc. to less than significant levels. Caltrans failed to examine
26 and discuss potential mitigation measures that would substantially lessen the Project's
27 potentially significant adverse impacts.

28

Palmiori, Tyler, Wioner -12-
Wilholm & Waldron LLP
Allorneys at Law FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
| 2547982.2

1 51. The effectiveness of the proposed mitigation measures is not supported by
2 substantial evidence. Caltrans failed to identify and impose adequate and fully enforceable
3 mitigation requirements. Undeveloped "mitigation" acts that may or may not be taken later at

4 Caltrans' discretion are inadequate.

5 52. Caltrans' failure to include mitigation measures, failure to examine and discuss

6 adequate mitigation measures, failure to adopt adequate mitigation measures, and failure to
adopt mitigation measures that are fully enforceable represents failures to proceed in the
8 manner required by law.
Inadequate Project Description and Environmental Setting and Improper
10 Piecemealed Environmental Review

11 53. Under CEQA, a Mitigated Negative Declaration must include a complete
12 description of the proposed project and environmental setting. A project description must
13 include the entirety of the project. The lead agency may not "piecemeal" or "segment" a
14 project by splitting it into two or more segments for analysis in separate environmental
15 documents. Here, the Mitigated Negative Declaration fails to consider the Project as a whole a
16 in a single environmental review document. The Mitigated Declaration also omits necessary
17 components of the Project and affected environment including the equipment that will be used,
18 construction activities and duration of construction. Additionally, the Mitigated Negative
19 Declaration fails to sufficiently demonstrate how construction of the Project would achieve its
20 stated goals. The Mitigated Negative Declaration does not adequately show why the Project is
21 necessary to achieve its goals, especially when compared to less expensive and less harmful
22 alternatives that were not considered or analyzed by Caltrans. Caltrans failed to consider and
23 analyze a reasonable range of alternatives to the proposed Project, thereby eliminating a
24 meaningful basis for comparing the adverse environmental impacts of the proposed Project to
25 environmentally superior alternatives. The Mitigated Negative Declaration also fails to
26 disclose and analyze the environmental context in both the immediate and regional setting.

| 2547982.2

1 54. Caltrans' inadequate project description and piecemealed environmental review
2 represents a failure to proceed in the manner required by law. Caltrans' failure to do so
3 represents a failure to proceed in the manner required by law.
4 Failure to Consult and Provide Notice to School

5 55. CEQA requires Caltrans to "consult" with and provide "written notification of
6 the project" to a school where the project involves the "construction or alteration of a facility
7 within one-fourth of a mile of a school that might reasonably be anticipated to emit hazardous
8 air emissions, or that would handle an extremely hazardous substance or a mixture containing
9 extremely hazardous substances . . . that may pose a health or safety hazard to persons who
10 would attend or would be employed at the school." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21151.4;
11 Guidelines, § 15186.)
12 56. The Willowbrook Campus of Anneliese Schools ("Anneliese Schools"), a private
13 school that provides education from nursery through sixth grade, is directly adjacent to the
14| Project. Yet, Caltrans failed to "consult" with and provide the requisite "written notification of
15 the project" the Anneliese Schools.

16 Failure to Address/Respond to Comments and Failure to Recirculate

17 57. CEQA and the Guidelines require Caltrans to address comments and suggestions
18 raised during the review process and to prepare a good faith, reasoned analysis in response to
19 all significant issues raised. Caltrans did not proceed in the manner required by law in that it
20 failed to adequately and accurately provide good faith, reasoned responses to comments made
21 during the CEQA public review process, including (but not limited to) inadequate responses to

22 comments raised concerning the Project's environmental impacts and feasible mitigation
23 measures and alternatives.

24 58. CEQA and the Guidelines also require that a Negative Declaration or Mitigated
25 Negative Declaration must be recirculated when it has been "substantially revised" after initial
26 public revicw. "Substantial revision" means either that (1) a new, avoidable significant effect
27 has been added, and mitigation measures or project revisions must be added to render the
28 impact less than significant; or (2) the initially proposed mitigation measures or project

Palmiori, Tyler, Wiener -14-

Attorneys at Law FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
2547982.2

1 revisions will not reduce significant impacts to less than significant levels, sO that new
2 mitigation measures or alternatives are needed. (See Guidelines, § 15073.5, subds. (a), (b).)
3 CEQA and the Guidelines further provide that the public must have an opportunity to review
4 the Mitigated Negative Declaration after modifications are identified--any necessary mitigation
5 measures must be specifically set forth in the Mitigated Negative Declaration in advance of
6 Lead Agency adoption of the Mitigated Negative Declaration. (See Pub. Resources Code,
7 § 21064.5; Guidelines, § 15070, subd. (b)(1).) Caltrans did not proceed in the manner required
8 by law. For example, the Initial Study with (Proposed) Mitigated Negative
9 Declaration/Environmental Assessment did not adequately analyze or consider the significant
10 impacts to Anneliese Schools, in particular the noise impacts. The Initial Study with
11 (Proposed) Mitigated Negative Declaration/Environmental Assessment did not include any
12 mitigation measures to mitigate the significant noise impacts to Anneliese Schools. During the
13 public review period, Caltrans was provided with numerous comments regarding its failure to
14 consider, analyze and mitigate the noise impacts. Caltrans' adoption of the final Initial Study
15 with Mitigated Negative Declaration/Environmental Assessment with Finding of No
16 Significant Impact purported to include a new (albeit inadequate) mitigation measure
17 purporting to address the significant noise impact to Anneliese Schools. Caltrans did so
18 without recirculating the Mitigated Negative Declaration and without providing the public with
19 an opportunity to review and comment on the new (albeit inadequate) mitigation measure.
20 59. In addition to the above, Caltrans' use of the Addenda regarding the Safety
21 Project does not comply with CEQA and the Guidelines. Caltrans side-stepped the
22 requirements of CEQA and the Guidelines through the improper preparation of the inadequate
23 Addenda and kept it from public review and scrutiny while, at the same time, it was asserting
24 that the Safety Project was a component part of the Project being analyzed and reviewed in the
25 Mitigated Negative Declaration. Caltrans' environmental shell-game violates CEQA and the
26 Guidelines.

3 60. Caltrans has the legal duty in making its determinations to comply with the
4 applicable law governing such acts. In particular, Caltrans has the legal and nondiscretionary
duty to act in accordance with the requirements of CEQA and the Guidelines.
61. As it relates to CEQA compliance, Caltrans acted arbitrarily, capriciously,
7 unreasonably, and without an adequate evidentiary basis in failing or refusing to comply with
8 the requirements of CEQA and the Guidelines. At all times material hereto, Caltrans had, and
9 continues to have, the ability to comply with its legal duties. Notwithstanding the efforts of
10 Petitioner and others to inform Caltrans of its legal duties, and to induce Caltrans to comply
11 with its legal duties, Caltrans has failed and refused to perform these duties as described
12 herein.

13 62. Petitioner availed itself of administrative remedies. There is no provision known
14 to Petitioner for any further administrative remedial action from the decision of Caltrans to
15 approve the Project.
16 63. Caltrans has abused its discretion by approving the Project and permitting the
17 acts and omissions described herein to occur.

18 64. In acting and failing to act in the manner described above, Caltrans has acted in
19 an arbitrary, capricious, and irrational manner lacking any reasonable basis, in violation of
20 Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1085, et seq.
21 65. Petitioner is beneficially interested in issuance of the peremptory writ of mandate
22 as prayed for hereafter. Petitioner will be harmed if Caltrans allows the Project to proceed
23 without first complying with applicable laws and regulations.
24 66. At all times material hereto, Caltrans has been able to perform its duties and
25 obligations as demanded by Petitioner. Caltrans has, however, failed and refused to undertake
26 its obligations. Caltrans has failed and refused to require or to perform any of the above,
27 notwithstanding the substantial evidence presented by Petitioner and others that such failures
28 and refusals are contrary to law and will have adverse consequences on Petitioner.

The litigation will challenge (among other things) Caltrans' preparation and approval of the Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Project instead of an environmental impact report ("EIR) and will allege (among other things) Caltrans' violation of the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub.

Re: Notice of Commencement of Amended Action - Public Resources Code
Section 21167.5
Regarding Caltrans' SR-133 Improvement Project and its component pieces including the SR-133 Safety Project

Dear Mr. Dolan:

Please take notice that Coalition to Protect Our Kids and Environment intends to
commence an amended action against Caltrans to set aside its approval of the SR-133 Improvement Project ("Project") and the Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Project. The Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Project provides that the Caltrans Project pieces together sub-projects Caltrans previously isolated from each other including, what Caltrans referred to as the State Route 133 Safety Project ("Safety Project"). Even so, after the filing of the original action challenging Caltrans' Project, Caltrans has taken the contrary position that its Safety Project is a separate piece subject to separate Addenda secretly processed without circulation for public review.

The litigation will challenge (among other things) Caltrans' approval of the Project, its preparation and approval of the Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Project and the separate Addenda instead of an environmental impact report ("EIR) and will allege (among other things) Caltrans' violation of the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code §§ 21000 et seq.) and the State Guidelines for Implementing CEQA (Tit. 14, Cal. Code Regs., §§ 15000, et
seq.).

Dear Mr. Becerra:

On November 13, 2018, we transmitted a conformed copy of the Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate in the above-captioned matter. On November 30th, Petitioner filed a First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate. Enclosed please find a conformed copy of the a First Amended Petition. This copy is provided to you in compliance with Public Resources Code section 21167.7, and Code of Civil Procedure section 388.
The litigation challenges Caltrans' approval of the State Route 133 Improvement Project and its adoption of a Mitigated Negative Declaration for that project. The Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Project provides that the Caltrans Project pieces together sub-projects Caltrans previously isolated from each other including, what Caltrans referred to as the State Route 133 Safety Project ("Safety Project"). Even so, after the filing of the original action challenging Caltrans' Project, Caltrans has taken the contrary position that its Safety Project is a separate piece subject to separate Addenda processed without circulation for public review. The First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate alleges that, Caltrans violated the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code §§ 21000 et seq.) and the State Guidelines for Implementing CEQA (Tit. 14, Cal. Code of Regs, §§ 15000, et seq.).
Please acknowledge receipt of the enclosed document. Unless you request otherwise, we will not serve on your office any documents other than the initial pleading (previously provided) this amended pleading (enclosed) and any further amended or supplemental pleadings.
