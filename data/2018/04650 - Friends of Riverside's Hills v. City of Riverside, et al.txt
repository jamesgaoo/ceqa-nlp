21 PETITIONER presents itself before this Court requesting relief afforded to it pursuant to Code

22 of Civil Procedure Sections 1085 and 1094.5 and alleges as follows:

23 Introduction

24 1. This is a challenge to actions by the CITY OF RIVERSIDE ("the City") in approving a

25 "high cube" Industrial Warehouse Building directly adjacent to the Box Springs Mountain Reserve and

26 the Gage Canal Trail, under Planning Cases P17-0506, P17-0507, P17-0748 and P17-0749. The

27 warehouse will have substantial unmitigatable impacts on the habitat within the Reserve as well as the
recreational opportunities on the Reserve and the Gage Canal Trail. The warehouse will operate 24 hours

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE -1-

1 a day, seven days a week, and will create nighttime noise and lighting that will impact the fauna on the

2 Reserve. It will create traffic impacts on the local intersections, intersections that are already

3 overwhelmed with traffic. It will create air quality and Greenhouse Gas emissions that have not been

4 mitigated to a level of insignificance, especially in light of the already-terrible air quality in this area.

5 2. On June 26, 2018, this substantial facility (hereinafter referred to as the "Project") was

6 approved on a Mitigated Negative Declaration under the California Environmental Quality Act

7 ("CEQA," Public Resources Code §§21000 et seq) despite public input that an environmental impact
report (or "EIR") was required by CEQA. In reviewing a Mitigated Negative Declaration, the trial court 8
must order preparation of an EIR whenever it can be "fairly argued on the basis of substantial evidence"
O that the project may have significant environmental impact, even if there is substantial evidence to the
10 contrary. Under this standard, deference to the agency's determination is not appropriate and its decision
11 not to require an EIR can be upheld only is when there is no credible evidence to the contrary (Sierra Club
12 V. County of Sonoma (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1307, 1316-1318).

13 3. The Box Springs Mountain Reserve (hereinafter "Reserve") is a reserve within the

14 Riverside County Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan, MSHCP. The City of Riverside is a

15 signatory to the MSHCP, and bound by its provisions, including provisions that direct the City to consider

16 the Reserve a protected habitat. The Reserve is also part of Riverside County's Box Springs Mountain

17 Park. The Reserve and its trails and open space provide significant recreational opportunities for the

18 residents of the City and County of Riverside, including Petitioner's members.

19 Parties

4.
20 Petitioner FRIENDS OF RIVERSIDE'S HILLS (hereinafter "FRH") is a California non-
profit corporation. Members of FRH live in the City of Riverside, hike on the trails within the Reserve 21
and on the Gage Canal Trail, and will directly affected by the adverse environmental impacts of the 22 proposed Project.
23 5. Respondent CITY OF RIVERSIDE (hereinafter referred to as the "City") is a political
24 subdivision of the state of California, having plenary authority over land within the unincorporated area
25 within its jurisdiction, and charged with the authority to regulate and administer land use and
26 development within its territory in compliance with the duly-adopted provisions of its zoning ordinances,
27 general plan, and in compliance with all applicable provisions of state law, including CEQA. The City

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE -2-

1 has the duty to consider and rationally balance the land use needs of Riverside with the needs and welfare

2 of its own citizens and all citizens in the surrounding jurisdictions. The City is governed by its City

3 Council (hereinafter referred to as the "Council") which had the power to approve the Project. Acting

4 on behalf of the City, the Council had the duty under CEQA to follow a statutorily-defined process to

5 involve the public in its decision-making.

6.
6 Does 1 through 20, inclusive, are persons presently unknown to Petitioner, which are

7 subdivisions or officers of the City who are responsible for the actions described herein or for carrying
out the functions of the City and who may be affected by this litigation. Petitioner will amend this 8
Petition to specifically identify each such Respondent as required and as the capacity and identity of each
9 such Respondent becomes known.
10 7. JIM GUTHRIE is an individual, who is listed by the City as the Project proponent, along
11 with GUTHRIE PROPERTIES which is also listed on City documents as GUTHRIE COMPANIES,
12 business entity of unknown form (collectively, Jim. Guthrie, Guthrie Companies and Guthrie Properties
13 shall be referred to herein as "Guthrie"). Guthrie's principal place of business is in Riverside, California.

14 8. ROES 1 through 50, inclusive, are persons presently unknown to Petitioner, and who have

15 a legal interest in the project being challenged herein, or are the property owners, developers, or others

16 with a legal or equitable interest in the real property at issue herein. Petitioners will amend this Petition

17 to specifically identify each such Respondent as required and as the capacity and identity of each such

18 Respondent becomes known.

19 Jurisdiction and Venue

9.
20 This court has jurisdiction under §§ 1085 and 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
10.
21 The Riverside District of the Riverside County Superior Court a is a proper venue for this
Petition because the acts performed by the Respondents, including the violations of law and statute, took
22 place in the City of Riverside, in Riverside County, and the impacts of the decision will have adverse
23 impacts upon the City and County of Riverside, its resources, traffic congestion, air quality, and the safety
24 of its citizens, as further detailed herein. The approval of the Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND")
25 for the Project without proper compliance with CEQA has exposed Petitioner and members of the public
26 to adverse and unstudied environmental impacts and will impose adverse impacts on the public resources
27 of the City and County of Riverside.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE -3-

1 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (For Violation of CEQA)

3 11. The California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code §§ 21000 et seq.,

4 ("CEQA") is one of California's pre-eminent laws for environmental protection. CEQA has both

5 procedural, informational, and substantive mandates. The procedural and informational mandates assure

6 that the public and decision makers are fully informed as to the environmental consequences of actions
that may affect the environment. CEQA'S substantive mandates include a prohibition on the approval
of projects with significant adverse environmental impacts when feasible alternatives can reduce, 8
eliminate, or lessen such impacts. It is crucial to follow the procedural and informational mandates of
9 CEQA to the letter, because these are the mechanisms by which CEQA's substantive mandates for
10 environmental protection are accomplished.
11 12. In this case, the City decided to analyze the Project (including approval of Design Review,
12 Grading Exceptions, and a Variance) utilizing an MND. However, use of an MND is appropriate only
13 if all adverse environmental impacts from the project can clearly and indisputably be mitigated to a level
14 of insignificance. If opponents of the project can raise a "fair argument" that adverse environmental

15 impacts may occur in spite of mitigation, then the lead agency must proceed utilizing an environmental

16 impact report. The City heard from numerous commentors concerning potentially significant adverse

17 impacts from the Project, including comments from Petitioner. The potentially significant impacts

18 described by the commentors included, inter alia:

19 (A) Traffic Analysis: There were multiple inconsistencies and failures in the traffic

20 analysis, including but not limited to the use of the wrong traffic impacts numbers; failure to acknowledge
the impacts of the traffic on already-degraded intersections; failure to consider the impact of recent 21
Council changes that would bar trucks with more than three axles on certain City streets; and other
22 problems with the traffic analysis that will be proven at time of trial.
23 (B) Air Quality Analysis: The impacts from operation of the Project will be felt through
24 the area, due to the traffic emissions, but the impacts will disproportionately affect the flora and fauna
25 of the Reserve. The Reserve is listed by the MSHCP as a sensitive receptor, but was not treated as one
26 in the analysis of the MND. Further, the South Coast Air Quality Management District (*AQMD")
27 recommendations for analysis of air quality impacts due to warehouse facilities were not followed.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE -4~

1 Additional and further unmitigated air quality impacts will be proven at time of trial.

2 (C) Aesthetic Impacts: The warehouse will block scenic views of and from the Reserve

3 and the Gage Trails. These impacts were not, and cannot be, mitigated to a level of insignificance.

4 (D) Noise: Noise impacts from the Project will be significant, especially from trucks

5 (back up alarms, acceleration) and the impacts will be disproportionately high on the Reserve. Nighttime|

6 noise impacts are especially problematic for the Reserve's fauna. Certain of these impacts cannot be

7 mitigated to a level of insignificance.

8 (E) Lighting: Lighting impacts from the Project will be significant, especially from
nighttime lighting. Certain of these impacts cannot be mitigated to a level of insignificance.
o
(F) Biological Impacts: Due to noise and lighting impacts, as well as air quality
10 degradation, the impacts on the flora and fauna of the Reserve cannot be mitigated to a level of
11 insignificance.
12 (G) Other Issues: There are additional unmitigatable impacts that will be discussed at
13 time of trial.

14 As a result of the impacts listed herein, which impacts cannot or will not be mitigated to a level of
15 insignificance, the MND failed as informational document, and the approval of the MND, as well as all

16 related approvals, must be voided.

17 13. Based upon all the testimony and comments from Petitioner and other commentors, a "fair

18 argument" has been made that unmitigated adverse impacts will result from the Project. For this reason,

19 an EIR must be prepared. A fair argument determination poses a question of law that does not

20 contemplate a weighing of evidence and a discretion to determine a fact: if there is substantial evidence

21 to support a fair argument, that is the end of the matter even if there is substantial evidence in opposition.
14.
22 The City's decision not to require an EIR is not justified by the facts or the law. Thus, the

23 City failed to comply with CEQA's substantive mandates. If an EIR is prepared, CEQA will require an
alternatives analysis. Petitioner is informed and believes and based thereon 24 alleges that there are other
locations that would be appropriate for the Project, locations that would allow the Project to operate 25 without the significant, unmitigable adverse impacts on the Reserve.
26
15. To the extent permitted by the City, Petitioner, its members and attorneys, as well as
27 members of the public, appeared before the Council, and/or other subdivisions of the City and timely|

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE -5-

1 objected to the approval of the Project on each of the grounds stated herein, as well as others not specified

2 herein but which may be raised at time of trial.

3 16. Petitioner has exhausted all administrative remedies available to it, has no other plain,

4 speedy or adequate remedy at law, and will suffer irreparable harm if the relief requested herein is not

5 granted and if the Project is implemented in the absence of a full and adequate environmental impact

6 report and compliance with all other applicable provisions of CEQA.
17.
7 Pursuant to the requirements of CEQA, the City was charged with the responsibility of

8 following the CEQA process to allow the public access to, and participation in, decisions concerning the
environment in and around the City of Riverside. The City failed in its responsibility by failing to comply
9 with the requirements of CEQA; by failing to provide an adequate environmental review of the Project
10 at issue and by failing in other and further ways to be proven at time of trial.
11 18. Petitioner therefore asks this Court for an order voiding the MND, and all approvals based
12 upon the MND.

13 19. Petitioner is entitled to recover its attorneys fees expended in pursuing this matter under

14 Code of Civil Procedure §1021.5, and asks for an award of fees and costs incurred.

15 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

16 (For Issuance of a Variance In Violation of City Ordinances)

17 20. Petitioner realleges the allegations set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 18, inclusive, as if set

18 forth in full herein.

19 21. Under Riverside City Ordinances, a project applicant must meet all the building]

20 requirements set forth in that Code. However, if the City can make certain findings under $19.720.040,

21 then a project can obtain a variance from the requirements. Those findings are:
(A) That the strict application of the provisions of the Zoning Code would result in
22
practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships inconsistent with the general purpose and
23 intent of the Zoning Code;
24 (B) There are special circumstances or conditions applicable to the property involved
25 or to the intended use or development of the property that do not apply generally
26 to other property in the vicinity and under the identical zoning classification;

27 (C) The granting of such variance will not be materially detrimental to the public

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE -6-

1 welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the zone or neighborhood in

2. which the property is located; and

3 (D) The granting of the variance will not be contrary to the objectives of any part of

4 the General Plan.

5 Failure to make all of the required findings shall require denial of the variance.
22.
6 In approval of the Project in this matter, the Council's findings on the variance were
arbitrary and capricious. There were no "practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships" in this case; the
Project proponent merely wanted to keep the building at its planned size and shift it a few feet closer to 8
the Marlborough cul-de-sac and Gage Canal trail. There were no "special circumstances or conditions
q applicable to the property involved or to the intended use or development of the property that do not apply
10 generally to other property in the vicinity." The Variance was therefore granted without substantial
11 evidence in support.

12 23. Petitioner therefore asks this Court for an order voiding the approval of the Variance, until
13 such time as the Council prepares and approves findings consistent with the Riverside Municipal Code
14 supported by substantial evidence in the record.

15 24. Petitioner is entitled to recover its attorneys fees expended in pursuing this matter under

16 Code of Civil Procedure §1021.5, and asks for an award of fees and costs incurred.

17 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

18 (For Violation of The Brown Act)

19 25. Petitioner realleges the allegations set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 23, inclusive, as if set

20 forth in full herein.

21 26. California's open meeting law (colloquially, the "Brown Act") is found at Government

22 Code §§54950 et seq, and requires that all meetings that will result in a decision on a project, such as the

23 Project as issue herein, be held in an open forum to allow public input and public observation of the

24 decision-making process.

25 27. The Brown Act applies to local agencies, such as the City (Govt. Code §54951), and

26 applies to any advisory board created by a city, whether permanent or temporary (Govt. Code §54952(b)).

27 28. In the case before this Court, before the Project was heard by the City Council, it was first

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE -7-

1 approved the City's Development Review Committee ("DRC") on May 2, 2018. Per City Ordinances,

2 the DRC is comprised of representatives from various City Departments having Approval Authority for

3 certain development projects. The DRC includes the City Planner, Building Official, and City Engineer

4 or designee(s), as well as representatives from Public Utilities, Parks and Recreation, Police and Fire

5 Departments. According to City Code, the DRC also serves as a "recommending body" to the Planning

6 Commission on applications for discretionary land use entitlements. The Project at issue needed

7 discretionary land use entitlements.

8 29. The DRC is not merely a "recommending body," but rather the final decision-maker on

O projects that need approval from the City. The City's zoning ordinance, Table 19.650.020 "Approval

10 Authority," lists the DRC as "final approval authority" (subject to appeal) for several types of decisions, |

11 including design review.

12 30. Unless a member of the City Council personally requests referral of a DRC decision to the

13 full Council, members of the public such as the members of FRH must appeal and pay the $2,529.00

14 appeal fee - to have public review and public comment on a project. This interferes with the public

15 process, and is anathema to public participation, as required by CEQA. Further, the regularly-scheduled

16 DRC members appear to be meetings covered by the Brown Act and preclusion of the public would
therefore be a violation of the Brown Act.
17
31.
18 Petitioner asks this Court for an Order finding that use of a "closed door" decision-making
process such as that utilized in this case for the DRC is a violation of the Brown Act; that all acts taken 19
by the DRC in the "closed door" session in review of the Project were null and void; and, that all future 20 meetings of the DRC must be open to the public as required by law. 21
32. Govt. Code §54960.5 authorizes the award of attorneys' fees and costs to a 22 successful plaintiff in a civil action to void an action taken in violation of the Brown Act or to
23 restrain further violations of the Act. Therefore, Petitioner seeks an award of attorneys fees for the
24 prosecution of this matter.
25 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays judgment as follows:
26 FOR THE FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION:
27 (1) Petitioner prays that the Court issue a peremptory writ of mandate, commanding the City

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE -8-

1 to vacate and set aside its approval of the Mitigated Negative Declaration, and all related

2 permits, variances, and approvals for the Project;

3 (2) Petitioner prays that the Court issue a Writ of Mandate suspending the authority of the

4 City, and its officers, employees, and boards, commissions and other subdivisions, to issue
any type of grading or development permits or other entitlements for use for the Project,

6 until the CEQA process is legally and adequately completed;
(3)
7 Petitioner prays for an order awarding Petitioners costs, and for an order of attorneys' fees
pursuant to C.C.P. §1021.5, in this proceeding;
8
FOR THE SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION:
9 (4) Petitioner prays for an order voiding the approval of the Variance, until such time as the
10 City Council prepares and approves findings consistent with the Riverside Municipal |
11 Code supported by substantial evidence in the record;
12 (5) Petitioner prays for an award of attorneys fees and costs under Code of Civil Procedure

13 §1021.5;

14 FOR THE THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION:

15 (6) Petitioner prays for an Order finding that use of a "closed door" decision-making process

16 such as that utilized in this case for the DRC is a violation of the Brown Act, that all acts

17 taken by the DRC during "closed door" sessions in respect to the project at issue in this

18 case are null and void, and, that all future meetings of the DRC must be open to the public

19 as required by law;

20 (7) Petitioner prays for an order awarding Petitioners costs, and for an order of attorneys' fees
pursuant to Government Code §54960.5; 21
FOR ALL CAUSES OF ACTION:
22
(8) For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper. 23
