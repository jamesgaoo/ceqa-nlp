25 INTRODUCTION

26 1. Petitioners RICHARD G. WILBUR Trustee of the Richard G. Wilbur Revocable

27 Trust, dated November 2, 1994 and RICHARD G. WILBUR, an individual ("Petitioners") seek a

28 declaration by this Court that the THREE RIVERS LEVEE IMPROVEMENT AUTHORITY and

00026937.1 1

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

THREE RIVERS LEVEE IMPROVEMENT AUTHORITY BOARD OF DIRECTORS

2 ("TRLIA" or "Respondents") must fully comply with the requirements of the California

3 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") (Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et al.) in connection with
4 their approval of the levee project Respondents refer to as "Modified Alternative 4." and TRLIA

5 must complete : CEQA-compliant, public environmental review process before attempting to

6 implement its modified project alignment.

7 2. Petitioners seek a peremptory writ of mandate pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure

8 section 1085 and/or section 1094.5 setting aside TRLIA's approval of the Modified Alternative 4

9 levee alignment and ordering TRLIA to prepare a CEQA-compliant supplemental environmental

10 impact report ("EIR") that fully analyzes all significant impacts, evaluates reasonable alternatives,
11 and identifies feasible mitigation measures before implementing the modified project alignment.
12 TRLIA purports to be studying the impacts of Modified Alternative 4 in a Supplemental EIR, but
13 an inaccurate and misleading project description, misleading and impermissibly narrow project

14 objectives, flawed assumptions, wholly absent or inadequate evidence to support feasibility
15 determinations, legally impermissible predetermination with respect to alternatives, failure to

16 consider alternatives other than those that give preferential treatment to the Real Party in Interest
17 and TRLIA's aggressive pursuit of only one option render TRLIA's belated Supplemental EIR
18 process an unlawful post hoc rationalization for a decision already made. By committing to

19 Modified Alternative 4, Respondents preapproved the project in direct violation of CEQA,
20 reducing it to a process whose result will be largely to generate paper, to produce an EIR that
21 describes a journey whose destination is already predetermined and contractually committed to,
22 before the public has any chance to see either the road map or the full price tag. TRLIA thus
23 thwarted the fundamental purposes of CEQA.

24 3. Petitioner seeks injunctive relief from this Court enjoining TRLIA from
25 implementing Modified Alternative 4, which TRLIA approved in violation of CEQA.
26 II. PARTIES

27 4. Petitioner RICHARD G. WILBUR, Trustee of the Richard G. Wilbur Revocable

28 Trust, dated November 2, 1994 ("Petitioner"), is the owner of record of that certain real property
00026937.1 2

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

-

2 located at 7062 Brophy Road in Yuba County, and currently bearing Yuba County Assessor's
Parcel Numbers 018-150-012, 018-180-080, and 018-180-082 (the "Property").
5.

4 Petitioner RICHARD G. WILBUR is an individual whose family, at all relevant

5 times since the 1800s, has resided and farmed in the Yuba-Sutter area. Petitioner and Petitioner's

6 family have farmed in the Yuba-Sutter region for decades and are stewards of the agricultural,

7 natural, and scenic resources in the area where TRLIA's project would be located. Petitioner is a

8 resident and taxpayer of Yuba County who would be negatively affected by the project's adverse

9 environmental impacts, procedural violations, and improper approvals. Petitioner and Petitioner's

10 a family have a direct and beneficial interest in TRLIA's compliance with state law, including

11 CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines. Petitioners' interests would be directly and adversely affected

12 by TRLIA's actions, which violate provisions of law as set forth in this Petition and which would

13 cause substantial and irreversible harm to the environment. The maintenance and prosecution of

14 this action will confer a substantial benefit on the public by protecting the public from the

15 environmental and other harms and procedural violations alleged herein. Petitioners submitted

16 comments to TRLIA objecting to and commenting on the project and TRLIA's failure to comply
with CEQA.

17 6.

18 Petitioner WILBUR PACKING COMPANY is an independent grower and packer

19 of the highest quality California prunes and walnuts a and has been a vital contributor to the Yuba-

20 Sutter community and economy for decades. Petitioner employs over 200 people year-round in
the Yuba-Sutter community. Petitioner's beneficial interest with

21 respect to its growing and

22 packing operations is adversely affected by the project, which would result in significant

23 environmental effects that will unnecessarily convert unique and irreplaceable agricultural land to

24 non-agricultural use and adversely affect Petitioner's agricultural operations. The project would

25 result in construction of a levee and borrow pits that will substantially and adversely affect

26 Petitioner's ability to conduct its vertically integrated farming operations.
7.

27 Respondent THREE RIVERS LEVEE IMPROVEMENT AUTHORITY is a joint

28 powers authority, organized and existing under the laws of the State of California, Respondent is
the "lead agency" for the project for purposes of Public Resources Code section 21067 and has
00026937.1 3

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

principal responsibility for conducting environmental review for the project and taking other

2 actions necessary to comply with CEQA. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege

3 that TRLIA is a single-purpose agency charged with the duty to responsibly and equitably plan a

4 flood control system for the benefit of the public. Petitioners are informed and believe and

5 thereon allege that TRLIA is not vested with land use authority or the discretion to elevate in its

6 review processes the inherent value of mining resources over agricultural, aesthetic, cultural,

7 biological, or any other environmental resource values, or to prejudge or presume the economic,

8 social, cultural or other value of such resources for expediency or any other purpose.

9 8. Respondent THREE RIVERS LEVEE IMPROVEMENT AUTHORITY BOARD

10 OF DIRECTORS is the governing body of TRLIA and is charged with the duty to review the

11 project in compliance with CEQA. The Board and its members are sued here in their official

12 capacities.

13 9. Petitioners do not know the true names and capacities, whether individual
14 corporate, associate, or otherwise, of Respondents DOE 1 through DOE 20, inclusive, and

15 therefore sue said Respondents under fictional names. Petitioners allege, upon information and
16 belief, that each fictionally named Respondent is responsible in some manner for committing the
17 acts upon which this action is based. Petitioners will amend this Petition to show their true names

18 and capacities if and when the same have been ascertained.

19 10. Real Party in Interest A. TEICHERT & SON, INC., is a California corporation
20 organized and existing under the laws of the State of California. Real Party in Interest is the
21 recipient and beneficiary of TRLIA's approval of Modified Alternative 4.

22 11. Petitioners do not know the true names and capacities, whether individual

23 corporate, associate, or otherwise, of Respondents DOE 21 through DOE 40, inclusive, and
24 therefore sue said Real Parties in Interest under fictional names. Petitioners allege, upon
25 information and belief, that each fictionally named Real Party in Interest is responsible in some
26 manner for committing the acts upon which this action is based or has material interests affected

27 by the project or TRLIA's actions in connection with the project. Petitioners will amend this

28 Petition to show their true names and capacities if and when the same have been ascertained.
00026937.1 4

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2 12. This court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure

3 sections 525 et seq., 1060, 1085 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21168 and

4 21168.5.

5 13. Venue is proper in this Court because the causes of action alleged in this Petition

6 arose in Yuba County where the project is located.

7 14. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

8 21167.5 by serving a written notice of Petitioners' intention to commence this action on May 16,

9 2018: A copy of the written notice and proof of service is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

10 15. Petitioners will comply with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

11 21167.6 by concurrently filing a notice of its election to prepare the record of administrative

12 proceedings relating to this action.

13 16. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

14 21167.7 by sending a copy of this Petition to the California Attorney General on May 17, 2018.

15 A copy of the letter transmitting this Petition is attached hereto as Exhibit B.

16 17. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this action

17 and have exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.
18 18. Petitioners filed the claims alleged in this Petition prior to expiration of any

19 applicable statute of limitations, in compliance with Public Resources Code section 21167.

20 19. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of
21 law for the improper actions of Respondents unless this Court grants the requested writ of

22 mandate to require Respondents to set aside their approval of the project. In the absence of such
23 remedies, Respondents' approval will remain in effect in violation of state law.

24 20. In seeking to compel TRLIA to lawfully discharge its public duties, Petitioners are

25 acting in their capacity as private attorneys general in the interest and for the benefit of the public

26 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to

27 enforce important rights affecting the public interest. Issuance of the relief requested in this

28 Petition will confer a significant benefit on the public by requiring TRLIA to carry out its duties
00026937.1 5

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

-

2 under CEQA and by compelling TRLIA to identify project objectives and a reasonable range of
alternatives that complies with CEQA and reflects a legitimate public purpose; to engage in a

3

4 legally adequate good faith analysis of the project; and to ensure that the public has a meaningful

5 opportunity to review and comment on the impacts, mitigation measures, and potentially feasible
alternatives for the project.

6 IV. ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS ACTIONS

7 21.

8 Petitioners bring this action on the basis, among others, that TRLIA's actions in
connection with the project were and continue to be arbitrary and capricious.

9 22.

10 Pursuant to Government Code section 800 and other applicable laws, Petitioners

11 are entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees for bringing this Petition to redress TRLIA's arbitrary
and capricious actions in connection with the project.

12 V. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

13 23.

14 Petitioners are duty-bound to seek this Court's assistance to compel Respondents

15 to comply with CEQA - meaningfully and in good faith - and to meet their obligations to

16 objectively evaluate and consider the environmental impacts of their decisions before those

17 decisions are made. This case is about TRLIA's disregard for the public's rightful role in the

18 review and decision-making process guaranteed by CEQA, which mandates public

19 accountability. CEQA also requires that TRLIA engage a as a partner with the public in evaluating

20 shared expertise, disclosing agency analyses, checking for accuracy, detecting omissions,

21 discovering public concerns, and soliciting alternative proposals. Instead, TRLIA has

22 predetermined the outcome of its belated "supplemental" CEQA process, which at this point

23 represents nothing more than the sort of "grudging compliance" with CEQA that the Courts of
Appeal have long cautioned against.

24 24.

25 In February 2017, Respondents and Real Party in Interest entered a closed-session

26 settlement agreement that stated TRLIA's new and foremost project objective would be to avoid

27 any affect on Real Party's property, and which also stated that TRLIA would comply with state

28 law by conducting CEQA review of the modified project in a supplemental EIR. Before news of
TRLIA's deal with Real Party in Interest even hit the newsstand, TRLIA had redesigned its levee
00026937.1 6

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

per Real Party's instructions through the middle of Wilbur Ranch.

2 25. Once a public agency has determined that an EIR is required, CEQA compels the
3 agency to promptly issue a Notice of Preparation and engage other reviewing agencies and the

4 public in an open review process. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21080.4; CEQA Guidelines, §

5 15082.) The role of the EIR and the importance of public participation in its preparation cannot

6 be overstated. "CEQA compels process. It is a meticulous process designed to ensure that the

7 environment is protected ... the EIR is the heart and soul of CEQA." (Planning and Conservation

8 League v. Department of Water Resources (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 892, 911.) The EIR "protects

9 not only the environment but also informed self-government." (Citizens of Goleta Valley v.
10 Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564 [italics added].)

11 26. Since at least April 2017, TRLIA has claimed that its environmental disclosures

12 and opportunities for public involvement soon would be forthcoming, but Petitioners and the

13 public have seen no such thing while the project marches on. TRLIA's strategy has been to delay
14 the required public process and work behind the scenes to advance Real Party in Interest's

15 preferred alignment. TRLIA thus would generate a false sense of "crunch time" for a flood a

16 protection project and deprive Petitioners and the public of the time and information reasonably

17 necessary to make decisions regarding the most rational, feasible levee alignment.

18 27. Since it entered the closed-session settlement agreement with Real Party in Interest

19 to ensure that Real Party's private interests would be paramount in all subsequent project
20 evaluations, TRLIA has assiduously avoided CEQA's procedural requirements and its public
21 CEQA duties. TRLIA opted instead to work behind the scenes to cobble together various

22 documents and "studies" in an effort to build a record for a decision already made, a without
23 providing any opportunity for the pubic to review and comment on the purported new analyses
24 these documents contain. Not only do these analyses fail to comply with CEQA's substantive
25 requirements, this type of disordered and informal process of environmental review simply is not
26 allowed. Only after an EIR is publicly reviewed and certified are an agency's conclusions and
27 findings regarding significant impacts, feasible alternatives and mitigation measures, and
28 overriding considerations subject to review for supportive substantial evidence. This makes
00026937.1 7

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

sense. Our elected officials and appointed regulators have discretion to make decisions within

2 their purview, but only after being informed by an objective environmental document compliant

3 with CEQA's salutary directives. Whether deferral of environmental review occurred or was
unlawful is a matter of CEQA process: an issue of law to be reviewed without deference to the

5 assertions or opinions of TRLIA. (Save Tara v. City of West Hollywood (2008) 45 Cal.4th 116,

6 139 [meaningful, good faith CEQA review must be timely]; Vineyard Area Citizens for
7 Responsible Growth, Inc. v. City of Rancho Cordova (2007) 40 Cal.4th 412, 441 [same].)

8 28. Respondents issued the Notice of Preparation for Modified Alternative 4 on or

9 about May 10, 2018, over a year late pursuant to the procedural requirements of CEQA,

10 notwithstanding TRLIA's repeated representations that the environmental review process soon

11 would commence. "[T]he later the environmental review process begins, the more bureaucratic

12 and financial momentum there is behind a proposed project, thus providing a strong incentive to
13 ignore environmental concerns." (Laurel Heights Improvement Association V. Regents of the

14 University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 395.)

15 29. TRLIA has irrevocably committed to the Modified Alternative 4 alignment before

16 any environmental review occurred. Its public statements, financial commitments, and other
17 actions have made it clear that TRLIA is committed to the Modified Alternative 4 alignment no
18 matter what. TRLIA now belatedly seeks to justify the significant unavoidable environmental

19 impacts of Modified Alternative 4 for a single purpose - a purpose established by a private party
20 unaccountable to the public - to avoid any encroachment onto Real Party in Interest's property.
21 TRLIA's NOP violates CEQA because it fails to identify the singular, non-public, and
22 fundamentally biased objective of the modified project.

23 30. Through disregard of their legal obligations and mischaracterization of the

24 proposal's true objective, Respondents attempt to hustle Modified Alternative 4 to completion

25 without meaningfully studying the proposal's potentially severe and permanent environmental

26 consequences or justifying the proposal's purpose or need. Premature approval of any project,
27 including one with lofty aims, violates CEQA. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15124(b); POET, LLC v.

28 State Air Resources Board (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 681, 722-726; Habitat and Watershed
00026937.1 8

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

Caretakers v. City of Santa Cruz (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 1277.) CEQA does not curtail the
2 public agency's ability to exercise its lawful authority for the advancement of such aims. Rather,

3 the law requires the agency to consider when it can properly use that power such that it does not
4 purposefully or inadvertently sidestep the mandatory provisions of CEQA. To allow TRLIA to

5 ignore the impacts of important policy decisions - such as where to build a levee or to allow

6 one private entity to dictate such decisions in its favor to the potential detriment of the

7 environment, the public, and other beneficially interested individuals, directly contradicts the

8 Supreme Court's guidance in Save Tara, supra, 45 Cal.4th 116.

9 31. Respondents cannot avoid a full and fair CEQA review process by simply refusing
10 to call an approval an approval, when the totality of circumstances surrounding its conduct and
11 actions indicates otherwise. In determining whether an agency has approved a project for CEQA
12 purposes, the California Supreme Court has made clear that reviewing courts should look not only
13 to the terms of an agreement - such as TRLIA's settlement agreement with Real Party in Interest
14 - but also to the surrounding circumstances to determine whether, as a practical matter, the
15 agency has committed itself to the project as a whole or to any particular features, so as to
16 effectively preclude any alternatives or mitigation measures that CEQA would otherwise require
17 to be considered. (Save Tara, supra, 45 Cal.4th at p. 139, citing CEQA Guidelines, §
18 15126.6(e).)

19 32. Whether or not an agency has approved a project, or a particular component of a
20 project, is a question of law on which the court affords no deference to the acting agency. (Save
21 Tara, supra, 45 Cal.4th at pp. 131-132, 139; see CEQA Guidelines, 15004(b), 15352(a); City of
22 Irvine v. County of Orange (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 846, 859 [Save Tara principles "apply
23 equally to public projects"].) An approval under CEQA is the decision by a public agency that
24 commits the agency to a definite course of action in regard to a project or component of a project.
25 (CEQA Guidelines, 15352(a).) "Generally speaking, an agency acts to approve a proposed
26 course of action when it makes its earliest firm commitment to it, not when the final or last
27 discretionary approval is made." (North Coast Rivers Alliance v. Westlands Water Dist. (2014)
28 227 Cal.App.4th 832, 859 [italics omitted].) "Approvals under CEQA, therefore, are not
00026937.1 9

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

dependent on 'final' action by the lead agency, but by conduct detrimental to further fair

2 environmental analysis." (John R. Lawson Rock & Oil, Inc v. State Air Resources Board (2018)

3 20 Cal.App.5th 77.)

4 33. The totality of the circumstances surrounding TRLIA's implementation of the

5 project shows, as a matter of law, that Respondents' conduct and actions in implementing

6 Modified Alternative 4 have reached the point of detriment to further fair environmental analysis.

7 Respondents have approved Modified Alternative 4 by significantly furthering the proposal in a

8 manner that forecloses other alternatives and puts substantial bureaucratic and financial

9 momentum behind the proposal without first complying with CEQA.

10 VI. FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION (Violations of CEQA)

11 34. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth

12 above in their entirety, as if set forth fully herein.

13 35. CEQA requires an agency to analyze the potential environmental impacts of its

14 proposed actions in an EIR, except in certain limited circumstances. The EIR is the very heart of

15 CEQA, and "the 'foremost principle' in interpreting CEQA is that the Legislature intended the act

16 to be read so as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable

17 scope of the statutory language." (Communities for a Better Environment v. California Resources

18 Agency (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98, 109.) The purpose of an EIR is to provide public agencies

19 and the public in general with detailed information about the likely effects of a proposed project
20 on the environment. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21061.) An EIR must fully analyze and disclose

21 all of the project's potentially significant environmental effects. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21100,

22 subd. (b)(1).) To be considered adequate, an a EIR must, at a minimum, provide a sufficient degree

23 of analysis and information to enable decision-makers to take action that intelligently accounts for

24 environmental consequences. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15151.)

25 36. CEQA requires the lead agency to adequately evaluate potentially feasible

26 mitigation measures and alternatives to the proposed action, to adopt all feasible mitigation

27 measures and/or alternatives, to determine whether the proposed mitigation measures are, in fact,

28 feasible and whether they will or will not be effective in avoiding or substantially lessening the
00026937.1 10

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

project's significant environmental impacts, to make conclusions regarding impact significance

2 based on adequate analysis and substantial evidence, and only then to make an adequate and
m supported statement of overriding considerations for those significant environmental impacts
v deemed unavoidable. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21002.1, subd. (b), 21100, subd. (b)(3); CEQA
5 Guidelines, §§ 15092 and 15093.)

6 37. The purpose of CEQA is to inform the public and agency decision makers of
7 environmental consequence before decisions are made. (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of

8 Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.App.3d 553, 564.) EIRs "should be prepared as early as feasible in the

9 planning process to enable environmental considerations to influence project program and design
10 and yet late enough to provide meaningful information for environmental assessment." (CEQA

11 Guidelines, § 15004.)

12 38. The question of whether environmental review must be conducted before
13 something less than a binding project commitment occurs has received much judicial scrutiny
14 over CEQA's forty-year history, but pre-2008 cases are no longer relevant since the California

15 Supreme Court provided definitive direction in Save Tara, supra, 45 Cal.4th 116. In Save Tara,

16 the Supreme Court explained that the timing of environmental review must not be "so late that
such review loses its power to influence key public decisions." (Save Tara, supra, 45 Cal.4th at 17

18 p. 131.) Significant agency action in furtherance of a project with potentially significant

19 environmental impacts, such as TRLIA's Modified Alternative 4, equates to commitment to a
20 project "as a practical matter." (Save Tara, supra, 45 Cal.4th at p. 132.)
21 39. CEQA contemplates an interactive process of assessment and responsive
22 modification that must be genuine. Use of the environmental review process to advocate for and
23 justify project approval violates CEQA. TRLIA's back room efforts to manipulate the timing and
24 scope of its evaluation of the project fails to minimally satisfy the basic informational purposes of
25 CEQA.

26 40. CEQA requires Respondents to prepare a complete and legally adequate EIR prior
27 to approving any proposal a that may have a significant adverse effect on the environment. The EIR
28 must fully disclose and adequately analyze the proposal's significant environmental effects.
11 00026937.1

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

CEQA also requires lead agencies, such as Respondents, to identify effective and enforceable

2 mitigation measures to lessen or avoid the proposal's adverse impacts, to consider a range of

3 alternatives and to implement them where feasible, to make adequate findings, including a

4 statement of overriding considerations for those significant environmental impacts that cannot be

5 avoided, and to do all of these things meaningfully and in good faith, in a public forum, before the

6 agency's decision is made. TRLIA violated CEQA by failing to comply with these requirements.

7 TRLIA prejudicially abused its discretion, acted in excess of its jurisdiction, and failed to proceed

8 in the manner required by law in its review and approval of Modified Alternative 4. (Pub.

9 Resources Code, §§ 21168, 21168.5.) Among other things, Respondents:

10 a. Impermissibly pre-committed to Modified Alternative 4 prior to commencing
11 environmental review. As highlighted in TRLIA's summary memorandum of February 2018,

12 Respondents by then committed themselves to a definite course of action that foreclosed any

13 option other than to proceed with Modified Alternative 4. The subsequent EIR process therefore
14 amounts to no more than impermissible post hoc rationalization. This violates CEQA. The
15 environmental document must be undertaken objectively and in good faith, not as an exercise of
16 form over substance. (County of Amador v. El Dorado County Water Agency (1999) 76

17 Cal.App.4th 931, 954.)

18 b. Failed to accurately describe the project and identify project objectives that
19 comply with the requirements and purposes of CEQA. (CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15124, 15378(c).)
20 C. Failed to analyze and mitigate direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts on
21 agricultural resources, biological resources, water supply and water quality, visual and aesthetic
22 resources, and cultural resources, including failure to comply with AB 52.

23 d. Failed to adequately identify and analyze alternatives and to mitigate impacts,
24 including but not limited to the significant loss of agricultural resources, by selecting a less
25 impactful, feasible alternative.

26 e, Approved Modified Alignment 4 based on assumptions and conclusions not
27 supported by evidence, including but not limited to TRLIA's assertions that certain impacts
28 would be less than significant and that alternatives to the project and mitigation measures that
00026937.1 12
Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

- would avoid or lessen the significant impacts of the project are infeasible.

2 f.

3 Failed to comply with CEQA's procedural and substantive mandates, improperly

4 delegated their planning, policy, and CEQA decision-making authority to engineering consultants

5 and other entities unqualified to make the environmentally-informed and publicly accountable

6 decisions CEQA requires and failed to exercise their independent judgment in making CEQA

7 findings. (Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish and Game Commission (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 134;
Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21002, 21081; CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15021, 15091.)

41. CEQA does not authorize an

9 agency to proceed with a project that will have
significant, unmitigated effects on the environment based simply

10 on a weighing of those effects

11 against the project's benefits, unless the alternatives or measures necessary to mitigate those

12 effects are truly infeasible. TRLIA has not accurately disclosed project impacts and has

13 mischaracterized project benefits. TRLIA's finding that mitigation measures and alternatives to

14 Modified Alignment 4 are infeasible is arbitrary, capricious, and unsupported by substantial

15 evidence in the record. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21002, 21081; CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15021,
15091.)

16 42.

17 Under CEQA, TRLIA owes the public a full and accurate accounting of the

18 project's elements, its environmental impacts, mitigation measures, and potential alternatives, for

19 review on a. timeline that makes such disclosure meaningful. Respondents have failed to meet
these basic standards.

20 VII. SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION (Pattern and

21 Procedural and Substantive Mandates) Practice of Failure to Apply CEQA's

22 43.

23 Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth
above in their entirety, as if set forth fully herein.

24 44.

25 Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that Respondents have

26 engaged in a pattern and practice of ignoring the environmental consequences of its actions by,

27 among other things, failing to incorporate environmental considerations into project planning and

28 design, understating environmental impacts, failing to identify and adopt feasible alternatives and
mitigation measures, and issuing unsupported blanket overrides that dismiss the significant
00026937.1 13

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

unavoidable environmental impacts of flood control activities in a manner that contravenes

2 CEQA's mandates. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that Respondents

3 a have engaged in a pattern and practice of disregarding CEQA's substantive mandate requiring

4 lead agencies to consider potentially feasible mitigation measures and alternatives to their

5 activities, to adopt such measures and alternatives whenever feasible, and to support findings of

6 infeasibility with substantial evidence. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21002, 21081; CEQA

7 supra, 16 Cal.4th at p. 134; see also Guidelines, §§ 15021, 15091; Mountain Lion Foundation,

8 Preservation Action Council v. City of San Jose (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1336, 1456; County of

9 San Diego V. Grossmont-Cuyamaca Community College District (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 86;

10 Association of Irritated Residents v. County of Madera (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 1383.)
11 Respondents routinely ignore CEQA's substantive mandate in making unsupported findings of

12 economic infeasibility, which can only be justified if additional costs or lost profitability are

13 sufficiently severe as to render it impractical to proceed with the project. Under CEQA, "[t]he

14 fact that an alternative may be more expensive or less profitable is not sufficient to show that the

15 alternative is financially infeasible." (Center for Biological Diversity v. County of San

16 Bernardino (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 866,.883; Uphold Our Heritage v. Town of Woodside (2007)
17 147 Cal.App.4th 587, 600.) Respondents' pattern and practice of "cheapest is always best"
18 planning and decision-making violates CEQA.

19 45. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that TRLIA repeatedly and
20 systematically evades its legal obligations under CEQA to engage the public and to evaluate the
21 cumulative impacts of its multiple project approvals, in favor of consistently relying on addenda
22 and other shortcuts and deferring this analysis to prior environmental assessments that did not
23 adequately address the direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts of agricultural land conversion
24 and other significant adverse environmental effects. Respondents thereby have avoided
25 disclosure of information and documentation that is necessary to assess and mitigate
26 environmental impacts of the project. These practices circumvent Respondents' mandatory duties
27 under CEQA and mislead the public. CEQA is a protection for the public and establishes
28 procedural and substantive mandates intended to preserve the integrity of environmental
00026937.1 14
Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

resources, including but not limited to agricultural lands, which otherwise may be threatened by

2 expedient and uninformed decision-making.

3 46. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that Respondents have

4 repeatedly and systematically delegated their planning, policy, and CEQA decision-making

5 authority to engineering consultants and other entities unqualified to make the environmentally-

6 informed and publicly accountable decisions CEQA requires and have engaged in a pattern and

7 practice of failure to exercise their independent judgment in making CEQA findings. (Pub.
Resources Code, § 21081; CEQA Guidelines, § 15091; City of Marina v. Board of Trustees of the

9 California State University (2006) 39 Cal.4th 341, 366.)

10 47. Petitioners contend that Respondents have acted in an arbitrary and capricious
11 manner, have failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and have prejudicially abused their
12 discretion in repeatedly and systematically failing to comply with CEQA's substantive mandate
13 by engaging in a pattern and practice of improperly relying on blanket statements of overriding
14 considerations, addenda, and findings of infeasibility that arbitrarily reject mitigation measures
15 and alternatives, brush aside environmental considerations, violate the procedural requirements of
16 CEQA, and are unsupported by substantial evidence.
17 VIII. THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION (Declaratory Relief)

18 48. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth
19 above in their entirety, as if set forth fully herein.

20 49. Petitioners seek a judicial declaration that Respondents must fully comply with the
21 requirements of CEQA in connection with their approval of the levee project Respondents refer to
22 as "Modified Alternative 4," and must complete a CEQA-compliant, public environmental review
23 process before attempting to implement its modified project alignment.
24 50. Respondents have mandatory duties to comply with CEQA and other legal
25 requirements applicable to the project before making a commitment to a course of action to
26 implement the project.

27 51, Petitioners have the right to enforce these mandatory duties.
28 52. Petitioners have no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy at law, and will
00026937.1 15
Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

-

2 suffer irreparable injury unless they receive the relief requested in this Petition.
53.

3 An actual controversy exists between Petitioners and Respondents as to whether

4 the actions and conduct of Respondents alleged in this Petition, and the pattern and practice of

5 same, have violated CEQA as identified herein. This controversy implicates the legality of

6 Respondents' implementation of CEQA including but not limited to their implementation of the

7 settlement agreement with Real Party in Interest, their conduct and actions in reviewing flood

8 control projects and proposed modifications, and in approving Modified Alternative 4 prior to

9 complying with CEQA. This controversy therefore implicates the validity of Respondents'
actions with

10 respect to the project and, consequently, the legal ability of Respondents to take

11 further actions to implement Modified Alternative 4. Petitioners contend that each and all such

12 actions and conduct, and Respondents' pattern and practice of same, have violated and will

13 continue to violate CEQA. Petitioners are informed and believe, and based thereon allege, that

14 Respondents dispute these contentions. A judicial resolution of that controversy is now required
pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 1060.

15 54.

16 Petitioners request a judicial declaration that Respondents' actions and conduct

17 alleged in this Petition have violated and will violate CEQA. Such declaration is necessary and

18 appropriate at this time under the circumstances in order that Petitioners and Respondents may
ascertain their rights and duties.

19 55.

20 Petitioners have no plain, speed, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.

21 No money damages or other legal remedy could adequately compensate Petitioners for the harms
described in the preceding paragraphs.

22 IX. FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION (Injunctive Relief)

23 56.

24 Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth
above in their entirety, as if set forth fully herein.

25 57.

26 Respondents are threatening to proceed with implementation of Modified

27 Alternative 4 notwithstanding their failure to complete a CEQA-compliant, public environmental

28 review process. This action will bring irreparable harm to Petitioners and all others who reside,
work, or own property within proximity of the project and will cause significant environmental
00026937.1 16
Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

harm that will not be avoided or fully mitigated to the extent feasible. Petitioners seek injunctive
2 relief to redress Respondents' pre-commitment to the project so that Respondents' approval of the
3 project and the circumstances surrounding that approval no longer can prejudice Respondents'
4 compliance with CEQA during the EIR review process and during Respondents' consideration of
5 the project on its merits or lack thereof. (See, e.g., San Bernardino Valley Audubon Society v.

6 Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 1097, citing San
Joaquin Raptor/Wildlife Rescue Center v. County of Stanislaus (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 713, 742,

8 32 [injunction justified in view of grudging and pro forma compliance with CEQA]; City of

9 Santee v. County of San Diego, supra, 214 Cal.App.3d 1438, 1456 ["The Board must begin anew
10 the analytical process required under CEQA and must not attempt to give post hoc
11 rationalizations for actions already taken in violation of CEQA, even if done in good faith"].)

12 58. A temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent
13 injunctions should issue restraining Respondents and their representative agents, servants, and
14 employees, and all others acting in concert with Respondents on their behalf, from taking any
15 further action to implement the project pending full compliance with the requirements of CEQA.

16 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

17 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as follows:

18 1. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate commanding Respondents to
19 vacate and set aside their approval of Modified Alternative 4;

20 2. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate commanding Respondents to
21 fully comply with CEQA and take all other action required by Public Resource Code section
22 21168.9;

23 3. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate commanding the Respondents to
24 comply with the California Eminent Domain Law and take all other action required by law;
25 4. For a declaratory judgment that Respondents' actions and conduct alleged in this
26 Petition have violated and will violate CEQA and other laws identified herein;

27 5. For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent
28 injunctions should issue restraining Respondents and their representative agents, servants, and
00026937.1 17
Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

~4 employees, and all others acting in concert with Respondents on their behalf, from taking any

2 further action to implement the project pending full compliance with the requirements of CEQA

3 and other laws identified in this Petition;

4 6. For costs of suit;

5 7. For Petitioners' reasonable attorney fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure

6 section 1021.5 and other provisions of law; and

7 8. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Dear Mr. Brunner:

This letter is to notify you that Richard G. Wilbur, Trustee of the Richard G. Wilbur Revocable Trust, dated November 2, 1994, Richard G. Wilbur, and Wilbur Packing Company (collectively "Wilbur") will file suit against Three Rivers Levee Improvement Authority and Three Rivers Levee Improvement Authority Board of Directors (collectively "TRLIA") for failure to observe the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq. and the CEQA Guidelines, California Code of Regulations section 15000 et seq. This notice is given pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.5.

Please note that, pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6, the record of proceedings for TRLIA's actions includes, among other items, all "internal agency communications, including staff notes and memoranda related to the project or to compliance with [CEQA]."
