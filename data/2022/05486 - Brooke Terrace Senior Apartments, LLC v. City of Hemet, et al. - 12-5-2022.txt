INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO COMPLETE THE COVER SHEET CM-010
To Plaintiffs and Others Filing First Papers. If you are filing a first paper (for example, a complaint) in a civil case, you must complete and file, along with your first paper, the Civil Case Cover Sheet contained on page 1. This information will be used to compile statistics about the types and numbers of cases filed. You must complete items 1 through 6 on the sheet. In item 1, you must check one box for the case type that best describes the case. If the case fits both a general and more specific type of case listed in item 1, check the more specific one. If the case has multiple causes of action, check the box that best indicates the primary cause of action. To assist you in completing the sheet, examples of the cases that belong under each case type in item 1 are provided below. A cover sheet must be filed only with your initial paper. Failure to file a cover sheet with the first paper filed in a civil case may subject a party, its counsel, or both to sanctions under rules 2.30 and 3.220 of the California Rules of Court.
To Parties in Rule 3.740 Collections Cases. A "collections case" under rule 3.740 is defined as an action for recovery of money owed in a sum stated to be certain that is not more than $25,000, exclusive of interest and attorney's fees, arising from a transaction in which property, services, or money was acquired on credit. A collections case does not include an action seeking the following: (1) tort damages, (2) punitive damages, (3) recovery of real property, (4) recovery of personal property, or (5) a prejudgment writ of a attachment. The identification of a case as a rule 3.740 collections case on this form means that it will be exempt from the general time-for-service requirements and case management rules, unless a defendant files a responsive pleading. A rule 3.740 collections case will be subject to the requirements for service and obtaining a judgment in rule 3.740. To Parties in Complex Cases. In complex cases only, parties must also use the Civil Case Cover Sheet to designate whether the case is complex. If a plaintiff believes the case is complex under rule 3.400 of the California Rules of Court, this must be indicated by completing the appropriate boxes in items 1 and 2. If a plaintiff designates a case as complex, the cover sheet must be served with the complaint on all parties to the action. A defendant may file and serve no later than the time of its first appearance a joinder in the plaintiff's designation, a counter-designation that the case is not complex, or, if the plaintiff has made no designation, a designation that the case is complex.

18 adjudicatory body in the City. The City and the Council are referred to herein collectively as
19 "Respondents."

20 5. The City and the Council are obligated to carry out and comply with the
21 requirements of law in the review and processing of land use, zoning and development
22 applications, permits and approvals for property located within the City, including ensuring
23 compliance with all applicable provisions of the Hemet Municipal Code.

4 operating under the laws of the State of California.

5 8. Real Party constitutes the proponent of a proposed 96-unit, three-story multi-family

25 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

26 12. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding
27 paragraphs.

GONZALES
LAW GROUP APC 3
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 13. This court has jurisdiction under Public Resources Code sections 21168 and
2 21168.5 and under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5. Venue is proper in
3 Riverside County because the parties are located there. Venue for this action also properly lies in
4 this Court because the cause of action alleged in this Petition arose in Riverside County. The
5 Project is proposed for development in Riverside County, and the impacts of the Project will occur
6 in Riverside County.

7 14. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant
8 action and has exhausted available administrative remedies to the extent possible and required by
9 law.

10 15. Respondents have taken final agency actions with respect to approving the Project
11 and exempting the Project from the requirements of CEQA. Respondents have a duty to comply
12 with applicable state laws, including but not limited to CEQA, prior to undertaking the
13 discretionary approvals at issue in this lawsuit. Petitioner possesses no effective remedy to
14 challenge the approvals at issue in this action other than by means of this lawsuit.

15 16. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by mailing to
16 Respondents a letter stating that Petitioner planned to file a lawsuit seeking to invalidate
17 Respondents' exemption of the Project from CEQA. Attached hereto as Exhibit A is the true and
18 correct copy of that letter with proof of service.

19 17. Petitioner will comply with Public Resources Code section 21167 .7 and Code of
20 Civil Procedure section 388 in a timely manner by furnishing the Attorney General of the State of
21 California with a copy of the Petition within 10 days of the filing of the instant action.

22 18. Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6(a), Petitioner shall file a
23 request that the City prepare the record of proceedings relating to the subject of this action. This
24 request, together with the complaint or petition, will be served personally upon the public agency
25 no later than 10 business days from the date that the action was filed with the Superior Court.

26 19. Petitioner has a beneficial right and interest in Respondents' fulfillment of all
27 of their legal duties, including, but not limited to, their duties pursuant to CEQA and the CEQA
28

GONZALES
LAW GROUP APC
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Guidelines, as alleged in this pleading.

2 20. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
3 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside their
4 CEQA Notice of Exemption for the Project. In the absence of such a remedy, Respondents'
5 approval of the Project, and its exemption of the Project from CEQA, will remain in effect in
6 violation of State law, and Petitioner and the residents of the Brooke Terrace Senior Apartments
7 will be irreparably harmed. No money damages or legal remedy could adequately compensate

8 Petitioner and the residents of the Brooke Terrace Senior Apartments for that harm.

9 BACKGROUND FACTS

10 21. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding
11 paragraphs.
12 The Brookes Terrace Senior Apartments

13 22. Petitioner has continually owned and operated the Brooke Terrace Senior
14 Apartments as a senior living facility at Brooke Terrace Property for period of years. The operation
15 of the Brooke Terrace Senior Apartments predated Project application submitted by Real Party to
16 the City by many years, and its existence as an adjacent senior living facility was known (or should
17 have been known) to both Respondents and Real Party prior to and during the Project application
18 and entitlement phases.

19 23. Brooke Terrace Senior Apartments constitutes a sensitive a receptor for the purposes
20 of CEQA impact analyses, and, due to its close proximity to the Project, is especially vulnerable to
21 Project construction-related impacts such as noise.

22 The City's Project Approval

23 24. On October 18, 2022, Applicant requested, and the City Planning Commission
24 ("Planning Commission") approved the design and construction of the Project, which includes 24
25 (795 square-foot) one-bedroom units and 72 (1,050 square-foot) two-bedroom units totaling 96
26 units, a recreational center, a leasing office, pool and spa area, recreational amenities, parking, and
27 wrought iron fencing.

GONZALES
LAW GROUP APC 5
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 25. Encompassed within the City's approval of the Project was Side Development
2 Review pursuant to Hemet Municipal Code Section 90-48.1; an Administrative Adjustment
3 pursuant to Hemet Municipal Code Section 90-45.3; and adoption of a Class 32 urban infill
4 exemption under CEQA (the "Exemption")

5 The Exemption

6 26. CEQA mandates that the long-term protection of the environment shall
7 be the guiding criterion in public decisions throughout California. See Public Resources Code PRC
8 Â§ 21001(d). To achieve its objectives of environmental protection, CEQA imposes on public
9 agencies the obligation to assess the environmental impacts of most proposed projects. Only if a
10 project falls into an exempt category, or it can be seen with certainty that the activity in question
11 will not have a significant effect on the environment, can the public agency avoid its otherwise
12 applicable duty to assess fully a project's environmental impacts. Significant environmental effect
13 is defined very broadly as a substantial or potentially substantial adverse change in the environment.
14 An effect on the environment need not be "momentous" to meet the CEQA test for significance; it
15 is enough that the impacts are not trivial.

16 27. The CEQA Guidelines identifies certain classes of projects which are exempt from
17 the provisions of CEQA. These are known as categorical exemptions. Exemptions to CEQA are

18 narrowly construed and categorical exemption categories are permissibly expanded beyond the
19 reasonable scope of their express statutory or regulatory language.

20 28. In order to properly apply a Class 32 urban infill exemption to the Project, pursuant

21 to CEQA Guidelines Section 15332, the City needed to make the following findings: (a) The
22 project is consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable general plan
23 policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and regulations; (b) The proposed
24 development occurs within city limits on a project site of no more than five acres substantially
25 surrounded by urban uses; (c) The project site has no value as habitat for endangered, rare, or
26 threatened species; (d) Approval of the project would not result in any significant effects relating
27 to traffic, noise, air quality or water quality; and (e) The site can be adequately served by all
28

GONZALES
LAW GROUP APC 6
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 required utilities and public services.

2 29. Additionally, even if the Project was determined to be fit within the Class 32
3 categorical exemption, the City was required to consider whether the exemption was negated by

4 an exception prescribed in CEQA Guidelines Section 15300.2 and Public Resources Code Section

5 21084.

6 30. In the instant action, the City failed to undertake its legal obligations to properly
7 evaluate whether a Class 32 exemption applied, and, further, to determine whether an exception to
8 the exemption applied.

31. The record before the City Planning Commission contained no evidence to support
10 a determination that the Project qualified for the Exemption.

11 32. Further, the City failed completely to analyze whether an exception to the
12 Exemption applies. In particular, the City should have assessed whether the Project and successive
13 projects of the same type in the same area of the City would result in cumulative impacts; and also
14 whether unusual circumstances created the possibility of significant effects.

15 33. The entirety of the CEQA record relied on by the City Planning Commission
16 consists of less than one page of written text. The entirety of the City justification for adopting the
17 Exemption is contained within the Staff Report presented to the City Planning Commission at its
18 October 18, 2022 public hearing, and reads as follows:

19 The is project is exempt from provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act
20 (CEQA) under CEQA Guidelines Section 15332 (In-Fill Development Projects) Class 32 in that information contained in the project file and documents incorporated herein by
21 reference demonstrates that: Site Development Review No. 22-009 and Administrative

22 Adjustment No. 22-002 is consistent with the Very High Density Residential (VHDR) General Plan designation (18.1-30 dwelling units per acre) and all applicable General Plan
23 policies as well as the applicable zoning designation; the proposed project site is located within the boundaries of the City of Hemet on a project site of no more than five acres
24 substantially surrounded by urban uses. Site Development Review No. 22-009 and

25 Administrative Adjustment No. 22-02 has no value as habitat for endangered, rare or is threatened species; there is no substantial evidence in the record that Site Development
26 Review No. 22-009 and Administrative Adjustment No. 22-02 will result in significant effects related to traffic, noise, air quality or water quality in that the proposed design
27 incorporates and otherwise is subject to air and water quality resource agency design

1 required utilities and public services. As such, the project meets the criteria for application of a Class 32 (In-Fill Development Projects) Categorical Exemption under the CEQA
2 Guidelines. Additionally, none of the exceptions provided in CEQA Guidelines Section
15300.2 apply to this project.
3

4 34. The City's record supporting its adoption of the Exemption is devoid of reports,
5 field data, expert opinions or other documentation to bolster its conclusory findings. Additionally,

6 the City misapplied the standard for utilizing the Exemption, which required an affirmative
7 showing by the City that approval of a project "would not" result in any significant effects relating
8 to traffic, noise and air and water quality. Instead, the City merely asserted in conclusory fashion
9 that the record did not contain "substantial evidence" that the Project would result in harmful
10 effects.

11 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

12 (Writ of Administrative Mandate Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section

13 1094.5- Against All Respondents)

14 35. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding
15 paragraphs.

16 36. The City adopted a Class 32 urban infill exemption for the Project, pursuant to
17 CEQA Guidelines Section 15332. Section 15332 requires that the City make the following
18 findings in order to properly apply a Class 32 exemption to the Project: (a) The project is

19 consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable general plan policies as
20 well as with applicable zoning designation and regulations; (b) The proposed development occurs

21 within city limits on a project site of no more than five acres substantially surrounded by urban
22 uses; (c) The project site has no value as habitat for endangered, rare, or threatened species; (d)
23 Approval of the project would not result in any significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air
24 quality or water quality; and (e) The site can be adequately served by all required utilities and
25 public services.

26 37. Here, the City chose to determine that the Project qualified for the Exemption

27 without adequately analyzing the criteria necessary to establish that the Project, in fact, qualified

28

GONZALES
LAW GROUP APC 8
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 for the Exemption. The record before the City Planning Commission contained no evidence to
2 support a conclusion that the Project qualified for the Exemption. Thus, the City's decision to
3 apply the Exemption to the Project was arbitrary and capricious and constituted prejudicial abuse
4 of discretion.

5 38. Additionally, the City failed to analyze whether an exception to the Exemption
6 applied. In particular, given the abundance of vacant parcels of similar size within close proximity
7 to the Project Property, the City should have evaluated whether the Project and successive projects
8 of the same type in the same place would result in cumulative impacts. Further, the fact of the
9 existence of a sensitive noise receptor immediately adjacent to the Project - i.e., the senior living
10 facility located at the Brooke Terrace Property - should have led the City to evaluate whether
11 unusual circumstances created the possibility of significant effects from the Project.
12 39. The entirety of the CEQA record relied on by the City Planning Commission
13 consists of less than one page of written text (see Paragraph 33, above). CEQA demands more
14 from the City if it wanted to avail itself of the benefit of the Exemption to clear the Project.
15 Specifically, the City was required to provide some evidence, at a minimum, that (a) the Project
16 site had no value as habitat for endangered, rare, or threatened species, (b) the Project would not
17 have significant effects on traffic, noise, air quality or water quality and (c) the Project could be
18 adequately served by all required utilities and public services. Other than conclusory statements,
19 the record before the City Planning Commission contained no evidence in support of the
20 Exemption. Accordingly, the City clearly failed to comply with CEQA.
21 40. The City did not perform any analysis whatsoever on the Project's potential
22 impacts relating to noise, traffic, air quality, or water quality, and cannot validly adopt the
23 exemption without requisite analysis of these potential impacts. Additionally, the City misapplied
24 the standard for utilizing the Exemption, which requires an affirmative showing that approval of a
25 project "would not" result in any significant effects relating to traffic, noise and air and water
26 quality. CEQA Guidelines Section 15332(d). Instead, the City merely asserted in conclusory
27 fashion that the record did not contain "substantial evidence" that the Project would result in
28

GONZALES
LAW GROUP APC 9
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 harmful effects. Thus, the City did not proceed in a manner required by law, which constitutes
2 prejudicial abuse of discretion as defined by California Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5(b)

41. As noted immediately above, the City was obligated to make an affirmative
4 showing that the Project would not create significant impacts relating to noise, traffic and water
5 and air quality. Thus, the language of CEQA Guidelines Section 15332(d) expressly required the
6 City to determine that the Project would not result in significant effects to, among other things, air
7 quality and noise. In other words, use of the Class 32 exemption required the City to make a
8 definitive finding, at the preliminary review stage, as to whether or not there would be a significant
environmental effect. The City's failure to make definitive findings on these subjects means that
10 the findings were not supported by the evidence, thereby constituting prejudicial abuse of
11 discretion.

12 42. The City did not make sufficient findings to justify its adoption of the Exemption.
13| In the record, there is only one page of CEQA analysis prepared by the City. The Planning
14 Commission's Resolution for the Project - along with identical language in the October 18, 2022
15 Staff report - is the only mention of CEQA findings in the entire record for the Project. The
16 CEQA findings for the Class 32 Exemption are contained entirely in pages 6 5 and 6 of the

17 / Resolution. Page of the Resolution states "there is no substantial evidence in the record that Site
18 Development Review No. 22-009 and 39 Administrative Adjustment No. 22-02 will result in
19 significant effects related to traffic, noise, air quality or water quality in that the proposed design
20 incorporates and otherwise is subject to air and water quality resource agency design requirements

21 to avoid any harmful effects." Therefore, it is beyond dispute that no substantial evidence exists in
22 the record to establish that the Project would not result in significant noise effect for purposes of
23 CEQA.

24 43. Additionally, the Project is located a considerable distance from any major
25 employment center, while also building nearly 100 units of entirely new housing on undeveloped
26 land without any nearby access to regional public transportation. This represents a significant a
27 increase in housing density in the City. Given the Project's considerable distance to major

28

GONZALES
LAW GROUP APC 10
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 employment centers, such as Riverside or San Bernardino, the Project may result in the generation
2 of a significant number of new commuter vehicles traveling daily throughout the region. These

3 vehicle miles traveled (VMT) impacts were not analyzed at all by the City, nor were these VMT
4 impacts mitigated, as required. These blatant failures constitute a failure by the City to comply
5 with CEQA, and, therefore, the use of the Exemption to benefit the Project constitutes prejudicial
6 abuse of discretion.

7 44. As noted above, if a project is determined to be categorically exempt, the agency
8 must also consider whether an exemption is negated by an exception pursuant to CEQA

9 Guidelines, Section 15300.2, and Public Resources Code, Section 21084. The City failed to make
10 any such consideration. In particular, the City should have considered whether the Project and
11 successive projects of the same type in the same place would result in cumulative impacts. It is
12 readily apparent to even a casual observer that the Project Property is surrounded by a number of
13 empty lots ripe for the same type of automobile-oriented housing as the Project. Just immediately
14 across the street from the Project there are currently two undeveloped lots that could serve as
15 locations of successive projects of the same type. The potential for such cumulative impacts grows
16 significantly when looking even a block or two north of the Project. For example, a full city block
17 currently sits empty between Fruitvale Avenues and Menlo Avenue, just one block to the north of
18 the Project along Sanderson Avenue. Given the availability of such a large amount of
19 undeveloped land ripe for development of successive projects of the same type within close
20 proximity to the Project, the City should have analyzed potential cumulative impacts from
21 successive projects of the same type in the same place.

22 45. Additionally, the City should have assessed whether there existed "unusual
23 circumstances" creating the reasonable possibility of significant effects. In particular, the City
24 should have considered whether the Project creates the reasonable possibility of significant effects,
25 especially due to the adjacent sensitive receptor use - namely, the Brooke Terrace Senior
26 Apartments. Here, it was known to both the City and Real Party that the Brooke Terrace Senior
27 Apartments - a senior living facility had existed for years immediately adjacent to the Project

28

GONZALES
LAW GROUP APC 11
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Property. Despite that actual or constructive knowledge, there was no evidence submitted or
2 relied upon by the City in analyzing the effects of Project construction and operational noise on
3 this adjacent sensitive receptor. In fact, approximately one third of the senior living facility
4 directly borders the Project, while even the furthest portion of the facility is only 400 feet away

5 from where construction will take place. This unique set of circumstances means that the Brooke
6 Terrace Senior Apartments is especially vulnerable to construction-related impacts such as noise.
7 The City failed to analyze whether this level of noise would be significant in light of the unusual
8 circumstance that the Property is adjacent to such a facility. This constituted a failure by the City

9 to comply with the requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines.

10 46. Individually, and collectively, these failures by the City in complying with the
11 requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines in properly applying the Class 32 Categorical
12 Exemption constitute prejudicial abuse of discretion within the meaning of California Code of

13 Civil Procedure section 1094.5(b).

24 3. For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent
25 injunctions restraining Respondents, Real Parties in Interest, and their agents, servants, and
