JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2

3 1. This is an action for injunctive and declaratory relief pursuant to 28

4 U.S.C. § 23(b)(2) and 42 U.S.C. 1983 for violations of Plaintiffs' rights under the
First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, as well

6 as the Federal Fair Housing Act, the Rehabilitation Act and analogous California

7 Constitution and statutory law. Jurisdiction exists pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and

8 1343 and under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201(a) and 2202.

9 Jurisdiction for the supplemental state claims is based on 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a).

10 2. Venue is proper in the Southern Division of the Central District in that

11 the events and conduct complained of herein all occurred in Orange County.

12 PRELIMINARY STATEMENT AND STATEMENT OF FACTS

13 3. For more than two decades, Mary's Kitchen has had exclusive use and

14 possession of, and maintained and improved the property provided by, the City to

15 operate a day shelter for unhoused and housing insecure individuals. The City
16 renewed this arrangement multiple times during that time period, with strong praise
17 for the services at Mary's Kitchen. For most, if not all, of that time, Mary's Kitchen

18 has been the only service provider in the City of Orange ("City") for unhoused adults
19 without children. While Mary's Kitchen received a benefit from use of the space,
20 the City also received a major benefit. Additionally, the people who rely upon
21 Mary's Kitchen received significant benefit.
22 4. Most significantly, the City advanced Mary's Kitchen as a critical
23 resource to evince the City's compliance with state housing element mandates and
24 federal funding requirements. According to the California Housing and Community

25 Development Agency ("HCD"), the City is currently out of compliance with state
26 mandates requiring the City to demonstrate how it will meet the needs of seniors,

27 FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT OBCLASS ACTION F.R.CIV.P. 23(B)(2) - 2

Case 8:21-cv-01483-DOC-JDE Document 44 Filed 01/03/22 Page 3 of 48 Page ID #:880

disabled persons, low-income and extremely low-income persons, and unhoused
2 persons. The forced closure of Mary's Kitchen will expand the City's non-

3 compliance with the state-mandated Housing Element.

4 5. Mary's Kitchen provides wrap-around services to about 330 individuals
weekly, the majority of whom have one or more disabilities. The annual number is

6 significantly higher as people become housed or unhoused throughout the year. This

7 is not surprising given the high incidence of disabilities among unhoused persons,

8 seniors and housing insecure persons. In addition, the North Service Planning Area

9 ("North SPA") shelters brought people to Mary's Kitchen daily to access critical
10 services offered by Plaintiff. Following the City's termination notice, only The

11 Salvation Army partners with Mary's Kitchen'.
12 6. Mary's Kitchen partners with groups such as Wound Walk, Project
13 Kinship, CalOptima, nursing schools, churches, and more. They also provide meals
14 to many religious groups around the County that, in turn, share with their members.
15 The closure of Mary's Kitchen will mean the loss of access to regular medical
16 services; a reliable source of nutritious meals; mail receipt for work and government
17 benefits; hygiene facilities, including showers, bathrooms and laundry; electricity

18 for charging phones and other devices, clean clothes and laundry services. Critically,
19 it is the only place in Orange with a safe place to rest each day for a highly vulnerable
20 population.

21 7. Because of Mary's Kitchen, women, veterans, and seniors are
22 connected with service providers to help find employment, access medical services

and information, register for benefits, and more. For decades Mary's Kitchen has

2 also reconnected people with family and assisted many to enroll in programs to

3 transition to some degree of economic security.

4 8. On June 18, 2021, in the midst of a deadly global pandemic, and
motivated by the increase in the number of persons helped by Mary's Kitchen as

6 result of the impact of the pandemic, the City Manager acted without authority to
7 issue a notice of closure of Mary's Kitchen by September 18, 2021. The existing and

8 most current written land use agreement between the parties allows operations
9 through June 30, 2024. The Notice was issued after the City expressed concern over
10 the increased number of homeless disabled persons with mental illness visiting

11 Mary's Kitchen and after Mary's Kitchen requested to open a small navigation

12 center at its location to provide greater services.
13 9. At about the same time, and in response to the demands of the City,
14 Mary's Kitchen hired a security company and consented to police entering their
15 facility to question anyone about their criminal status, without reasonable suspicion
16 or probable cause. In addition, the police increased enforcement of the City's
17 patently unconstitutional anti-loitering law in a manner repeatedly ruled
18 unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court. The City then bootstrapped its

19 discriminatory and unlawful acts of its officers to claim a spike in criminal activity
20 in the area somewhat near to Mary's Kitchen.

21 10. In 2018 litigation? the City suspended all criminal enforcement of anti-
22 camping laws and committed to a healthcare first approach to homelessness while

F building capacity for solutions. Nearly three years later, the City has taken no steps

2 to increase services or outreach to unhoused adults without children.3

3 11. Forced to put together a plan to replace the services now provided at

4 Mary's Kitchen, the City has been unable to do so. There are no service providers in

5 the City of Orange to replace a even a small portion of what Mary's Kitchen offers.

6 The City makes no pretense about its goal to exclude unhoused persons from the
7 City by removing all available services in the City. The City's proposals are grossly

8 inadequate and reflect a determination to ensure that the economically marginalized
9 communities assisted by Mary's Kitchen inevitably be forced to leave the City to
10 obtain basic survival resources, making them another city's "problem."

11 12. Moreover, the City's plan will have a disparate impact on those with
12 various disabilities, who lack the physical, mental, or economic ability to access the

13 disparate locations the City proposes replace the essential services they now have
14 available at Mary's Kitchen. For example, the City proposed people obtain their mail
15 at Micah's Way in Santa Ana. It took two able-bodied law students approximately
16 four hours to complete the journey from Orange to Micah's Way and back.4
Orange has proposed Mary's Kitchen's guests can get medical 17 13.

21 3 The City hosts a County-wide shelter for families with minor children
22 and a medical facility for those with health insurance referred by police for mental-

23 health crisis services. The City has no significant access to shelters in other North SPA cities. Mary's Kitchen may not refer guests to any shelter on its behalf.
24 4 Additionally, in December 2021, the Mayor of Santa Ana announced

25 to a community meeting that he intended to make sure Micah's Way could no longer operate there. Shortly after a code violation notice was issued. The future of Micah's
26 Way is uncertain today.

mobile medical units that currently serve Mary's Kitchen. This would require about

2 one hour of travel each way, plus the cost of a bus pass. In the midst of a pandemic

3 that is now beginning its third year, requiring the clients of Mary's Kitchen to travel

4 much of each day to replace basic services available at the Kitchen only increases
the risks to a population that already experiences a high percentage of disabilities

6 because of their economic situation, their senior status, their medical and physical

7 challenges and other cognitive and developmental challenges.

8 14. Orange has no plans to offer any of the services of Mary's Kitchen at

9 one-stop center in the City, where people may access those services without
10 spending hours per day traveling to and from different locations during a pandemic.

11 The City suggests people get meals at different locations each day with no option
12 for most meals. The City suggests that mail be picked up in Santa Ana. It has no plan
13 for access to laundry, showers, mobile medical support, clothes, phone charging and
14 the many other services offered at Mary's Kitchen.
15 15. The loss of Mary's Kitchen means that many of its clients will likely
16 decline in health or die if the City's only homeless service provider closes. When
17 the Kitchen was closed early in the pandemic, the number of persons in the City who

18 died without a fixed abode increased markedly. From January through mid-
19 December 2021, 372 people without a fixed address died in the County. The
20 numbers increased to record rates in the pandemic,' disproportionately in the City,
21 In months without full-service at Mary's Kitchen, more people died, reaching record

rates in July and September 2020. When the Kitchen restored full-service, the rate

2 dropped to zero or one death in most months.

3 HISTORY OF MARY'S KITCHEN

4 16. It is the mission of Mary's Kitchen to provide food, clothing, and basic
services that enhance the quality of life for the hungry and homeless in their area.
6 This mission is reported to the IRS and publicized. While Mary's Kitchen cannot
7 end homelessness without the assistance of the City, it does its best to help people
8 to access shelter and housing, employment and education, and in the interim to
9 enhance their quality of life with critical services. It is the unmistakable mission of
10 Mary's Kitchen to feed the hungry, serve the poor, and treat all people with dignity
11 and respect. The City of Orange is and has been aware of this mission.
12 17. In 1984, 82-year-old Mary McAnena found her religious calling
13 helping others. In 1986, the City recognized her program then providing service five
14 days per week in Heart Park. In 1992, the City passed an ordinance banning sharing
15 food in public parks. In 1993, the City agreed to allow Mary's Kitchen to relocate to
16 its current location, a city-owned property at the end of a cul-de-sac in an industrial
17 area, near the police department. In light of the new law, the City's only option was
18 to arrest the women who served its most vulnerable families for violating the new
19 law. In 2000, Ms. McAnena and the City entered into a formal four-year agreement a
20 to rent the property at no cost and to pay utility costs. Just three years later, at the
21 age of 100, Mary received the Albert Schweitzer Award of Excellence.
22 18. In 2004, soon after Mary McAnena passed away and Gloria Suess
23 stepped in, the City renewed the lease and expanded the site to allow for additional
24 services. At the time, Mary's Kitchen served about 65 people each day. The lease
25 was renewed again in 2010, and again in 2014, each time recognizing the critical
26 services provided at no cost to the City and the growing need for this resource.

Case 8:21-cv-01483-DOC-JDE Document 44 Filed 01/03/22 Page 8 of 48 Page ID #:885

19. Gloria Suess, now in her 80s, has been involved with Mary's Kitchen

2 for approximately three decades. She has seen how a reliable local mailing address

3 is critical for guests to receive benefits like Social Security, payroll from employers,

4 medication from the Veteran's Administration, notice of court dates, and more.
5 20. In 2019, the City Council considered the renewal in public proceedings,

6 as it had done in the past. The City expressly noted that the site was "well organized
7 and efficiently run" and referenced the volunteers as "very dedicated to the program'

8 putting these comments in the staff recommendation to renew. The discussion at the
9 City Council noted that, despite an influx in use due to the closure of the Santa Ana

10 Riverbed encampment, the patrons were "behaved and orderly" and that the need

11 had increased to about 200 people per day. As the City requested more security at
12 the facility, Mary's Kitchen complied, even though some of the requests were
13 I unconstitutional. These included directing people not to wait on the public sidewalk,
14 or near the gates of the Kitchen, and not to sleep in the area overnight. In addition,
15 Mary's Kitchen installed a security camera system as requested by police. Each time
16 the City police asked Mary's Kitchen to support criminal charges of lodging or
17 trespassing after hours, they complied and signed the requested documents.
18 21. The process of a public meeting, City Council approval, followed by
19 the mayor signing the agreement with Mary's Kitchen for exclusive use of the
20 property happened for each renewal as that type of land use decision required City
21 Council approval. When the City Council approved renewal of the agreement in

25 The City of Orange is a California general law city, and the powers and duties of the City Manager of the City of Orange are enumerated by municipal
26 ordinance pursuant to Gov. Code § 34852. Under California law, a general law city

27 may empower its city manager with general contract authority; that authority FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT OBCLASS ACTION F.R.CIV.P. 23(B)(2) - 8

Case 8:21-cv-01483-DOC-JDE Document 44 Filed 01/03/22 Page 9 of 48 Page ID #:886

2019, however, it delegated to the City Manager the limited and specific advance

2 authority to renew the agreement for an additional five years, without further city

3 council approval. the City Manager otherwise had no independent authority over the

4 agreement. The City did not give the City Manager authority to terminate the

5 agreement early or to use the land for any other purpose.

6 22. Mary's Kitchen never had an attorney review the agreement since all
7 discussions with the City led them to believe that, even as issues arose, the City

8 relied upon their services and planned to work with them on solutions at their present

9 location. This was reinforced when the City asked Mary's Kitchen to invest in the
10 infrastructure, including enhanced security, and partner with the new neighbor for a

11 security plan, which involved Plaintiff purchasing and arranging shipping containers
12 as a fence along the nearby property where housing was expected to be built. Plaintiff
13 made these infrastructure investments in reliance on the City's request.
14 23. Plaintiff Mary's Kitchen estimates that, since the 2019 renewal, it spent
15 approximately $160,000 in infrastructure and equipment investments in reliance on
16 the continuation of the agreement with the City for use of the property. Some of
17 these improvements responded to City demands for increased security.
18 24. In early 2020, as the pandemic tore through the country and everyone

19 struggled to adjust, Mary's Kitchen was partially closed, offering limited food and
20 mail pick-up, use of bathrooms, and emergency needs. With more limited services,

21 and under Covid-19 protocols, guests of Mary's Kitchen were forced to disperse

22 around the City in search of basic subsistence needs.

25 otherwise lies with the mayor. (Gov. Code §40602.) The enumerated powers

Case 8:21-cv-01483-DOC-JDE Document 44 Filed 01/03/22 Page 10 of 48 Page ID #:887

25. During that time, the City made increasing demands of Mary's Kitchen,

2 including that it monitor the actions of all unhoused people in the area, even if they

3 were not at Mary's Kitchen. Simultaneously, the Orange Police began escalating

4 citations and arrests for quality-of-life offenses and warrants for missed court dates

5 a in an effort build a false narrative of an increase in crime and blame Mary's Kitchen

6 based mostly on people unlawfully detained and cited under unconstitutional

7 "loitering" policies and police enforcement plan.

8 In September 2020, even before operations were fully reopened, the
9 City informed Mary's Kitchen it was concerned about activities outside the gates
10 and wanted the day shelter to hire a private professional security company.7 The City

11 asked that Mary's Kitchen stop providing services to those who "loitered" near
12 Mary's Kitchen, a population with significant mental health conditions, trauma, and

13 other disabilities. Plaintiffs allege, on information and belief, that the City's demands

14 were based on a provision of the Municipal Code, prohibiting "loitering" near a
15 shelter and imposing on shelter operators the obligation to enforce this unlawful
16 provision. Orange Municipal Code §17.04.027 JJ (4) (c) (i).
17 26. Despite the unconstitutionality of this provision, Mary's Kitchen
18 addressed all of these issues and hired a professional security company to handle the

intake area of the daytime shelter,& with some financial help from the County and

2 the Girl Scouts, but none from the City and still at great cost to Plaintiff. 9
3 27. In or around December 2020, Mary's Kitchen reopened when a state-

4 wide mandated COVID shutdown was lifted and slowly restored services with new
restrictions to meet COVID protocols. Many of the prior volunteers at the Kitchen

6 did not return because of concerns about their health based on age and co-morbidities.
7 Mary's Kitchen enlisted some of the guests to volunteer to perform some functions,

8 such as cleaning the facilities. When the City learned this, its demands escalated as
9 it challenged why guests were permitted to volunteer, making clear the City's goal
10 was to prevent people it perceived as having psychological disabilities, or without
11 housing, from serving as volunteers.
12 28. People who are unhoused in Orange County can call 211 to learn about
13 services since the City of Orange does not have any municipal outreach services.
14 The only resource for adults without minor children in the City is Mary's Kitchen.

15 When people call 211 in Orange, they are most often referred to Mary's Kitchen. In
16 2020, Orange 211 reported that it referred over 1,100 people to Mary's Kitchen,
17 There was no other resource in the City of Orange to refer callers to for the range of
18 services provided by Mary's Kitchen. There is still no other resource.

29. At the City's suggestion, Mary's Kitchen leadership visited the

2 Navigation Centers in nearby cities of Buena Park and Placentia. Both are 24-hour

3 operations that have similar wrap around services to Mary's Kitchen plus overnight

4 beds and the ability to get people into the County Coordinated Entry System for
potential housing opportunities. In April 2021, Mary's Kitchen asked to become

6 smaller navigation center. Despite repeated attempts by Mary's Kitchen to initiate :

7 discussion on this issue, the City declined even to respond to the requests to become

8 a navigation center. Approval as a navigation center would permit Mary's Kitchen
9 to refer clients to assistance available by the County for unhoused persons. While
10 becoming a navigation center would increase resources Mary's Kitchen could offer

11 in its regular operations and as the primary referral by 211 Orange, it would not
12 duplicate any current or planned services by the City since it has none.

13 30. The most reasonable inference is that the City unilaterally and
14 precipitously ended the agreement with Mary's Kitchen based on the concern that

15 Mary's Kitchen would assert its right to open a shelter pursuant to state law. To
16 avoid creation of any overnight shelter for single adults (many of whom have
17 disabilities) in its borders, the City ended its agreement with Mary's Kitchen. If true,

18 that decision is unlawful on several bases. Even with a "no-cause" clause for

19 termination of the agreement, the law is a clear such a provision is unconscionable if

20 exercised for an unconstitutional reason. The "no-cause" provision cannot be used

21 to shield unconstitutional discrimination.

22 31. The City's opposition to Mary's Kitchen expanding or becoming
23 navigation center, together with the City's statements about the increased number of
24 guests, disabled persons volunteering at the Kitchen, guests "loitering" in public

25 spaces near a shelter, and the demand for a more "professional" management to
26 control activity outside Mary's Kitchen's gates, all constitute unlawful conditions to

deny services to people with mental and other disabilities. The City's actions evince

2 both discriminatory intent and impact are clear.

3 32. The City's June 2021 notice to Mary's Kitchen, ending the agreement

4 for use of the property, was issued just weeks after Mary's Kitchen requested to
expand its services. The stated reason on the notice was that Mary's Kitchen enables

6 homelessness and so cannot be supported by the City. The express reason announced
7 by the City is unconstitutional. The Notice specifically pointed to the "change in

8 clientele over the past few years," referencing increased number of persons with
9 trauma, mental health conditions, and substance-use disorders all protected
10 disabilities. The City notice also referenced a purported increase in crime resulting

11 substantially from unlawful police enforcement of unlawful code provisions.
12 33. The City's reason for termination was and is the increased number of
13 guests with significant disabilities, including mental health diagnoses. Under the
14 fundamental doctrine of unconstitutional conditions, even if the agreement contained
15 a "no-cause" provision, while the City may act for no reason or any reason, it may
16 not end the government benefit that the agreement represents for an unlawful reason,

17 34. In August 2021, after issuing the termination notice, the City brought

25 residents are forced to travel to Santa Ana to receive critical mail, including benefits,
DMV, VA medication, and job-related documents, it will impact the entire region's
26 programs, shifting people by forcing them from the North SPA to the Central SPA

27 and adding to Santa Ana's already significant unhoused population.

3 QUALITY-OF-LIFE CITATIONS AND WARRANTS

4 35. People living without homes in Orange County often compile
misdemeanor charges for quality-of-life violations, including eating and sleeping
6 outside. Some are charged with loitering, blocking sidewalks, or illegal lodging,
7 Others are charged with crimes related to mental illness, lack of access to restrooms,
8 or substance use disorders. In many cases, charges are not filed by the date on the
9 ticket, so even if someone does make it to court, they are simply told that charges
10 may be filed at a future date and notice may be mailed to them. It is very common
11 for people without homes, transportation, and property storage to miss court dates
12 and have warrants issued for failure to appear, usually because they could not get to
13 court, or did not know about the court date due to not having a mailing address,
14 Many people receive court notices at Mary's Kitchen.
15 36. The police vigorously monitor the day-shelter. From January to June
16 2021, 80 arrests occurred near Mary's Kitchen. One was for a shopping cart violation,
17 three for public drinking, 12 for violations of the municipal code, 12 12 for trespass
18 or lodging on other properties, 35 for outstanding warrants not involving ongoing
19 crime, 15 were drug-related including use of cannabis, one was a parole violation
20 and one a failure to register under PC 290 as a transient in the city.

37. Notably, the City has no outreach programs, no healthcare staff and no

2 contract agency such as City Net to respond to the needs of unhoused single adults

3 in the City-only law enforcement. As it was when the OCCW litigation was filed

4 in 2019, naming the City as a defendant, the City's law enforcement mission has

5 been to make unhoused person's someone else's problem by pushing people to

6 neighboring jurisdictions. Indeed, the City boldly put its intentions in writing.

7 Captain Dan Adams distributed instructions to the police telling them that "[the
8 homeless] will keep coming back if we aren't consistent.»13
9 38. In the 2019 Point in Time Count the City of Orange had 341 homeless
10 people. The number of unsheltered individuals has likely grown significantly

11 because of the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic. Among other reasons for

12 this expected dramatic increase in people experiencing homelessness, the federal
13 Consumer Price Index ("CPI'*) reports the cost of renting in Los Angeles and Orange
14 counties rose at a 5.6% annual rate in March, almost a full percentage point above
15 the 4.8% increase a year earlier. This is the largest increase in housing costs in 12
16 years. Approximately one-third of unsheltered individuals in Orange County report
17 that they cannot afford housing, even though they are employed. At the same time.

18 Orange County in general and the City of Orange, in particular, cannot absorb the
19 increased number of unhoused persons. 14

39. Since litigation in 2018,15 cities including Orange have limited criminal

2 enforcement actions against those sleeping outside. While the City of Orange has

3 not arrested people from sleeping in public, without any shelter alternative to offer.

4 the Orange Police Department deliberately disrupts the sleep of homeless individuals

5 and directs them to move along.

6 40. Compared to the general population of Orange, Mary's Kitchen guests
7 are disproportionately people of color, seniors, and people with physical or mental

8 disabilities. The City's actions impact these protected classes, if not deliberately

9 target them. The City focused on the "changing" population as more adults with
10 disabilities became unhoused as a result of the pandemic, or were left unhoused in
11 Orange due to the lack of available services.
12 AVAILABLE SERVICE IN NORTH ORANGE COUNTY

13 41. The County is split into three planning areas for homeless services. The
14 City of Orange is in the North Service Planning Area ("SPA"). In addition to County-
15 provided services, many cities in the SPA provide some services for those they
16 identify as "residents" of their city. As a result, many people with disabilities are
17 barred from accessing local services because their status as chronically homeless

18 does not meet City-imposed "residency" requirements.
19 42. With the closure of The Courtyard in Santa Ana, there are no "no-
20 barrier" shelters in the County. The North SPA pocket guide lists three shelters. First
21 is the County shelter, Bridges. It is usually at capacity and requires referral from
22 County agency to access, which generally precludes access. Second, is the Anaheim

shelter. It is unclear which of the two Anaheim shelters this refers to but, for either,

2 a person must have both a City Net referral and approval by Anaheim Police

3 Department as an Anaheim resident. Orange residents are not accepted. Finally, the

4 Buena Park Navigation Center rarely has beds and they are prioritized for residents

5 of Buena Park, Placentia, and Stanton based on the earlier litigation. While other

6 cities may make referrals, they are rarely able to access beds.

7 43. The North SPA guide also references the County wide shelters limited

8 to domestic violence survivors. While their locations are not public, they also are
9 typically full and not able to accommodate guests of Mary's Kitchen. Finally, the
10 Guide lists three shelters around the County for families with minor children, all of

11 which also require referral through the County coordinated entry system. There is
12 often a waitlist for these as well.

13 44. The City of Orange is the location of one county shelter for families
14 with minor children from any city in Orange County by Coordinated Entry referral
15 only. No beds are reserved for residents of the City of Orange and no single adults
16 are allowed. There is no no-barrier or low-barrier shelter for adults without children,

17 seniors, or people with disabilities waiting for a placement in the City other than the
18 Kitchen's day-shelter.

19 45. The City suggests people can use the resource in the pocket guide
20 created by the County. The pocket guide lists benefits and services in Anaheim and
21 Santa Ana and Brea, clinics in Fullerton and Anaheim, and employment services in
22 Buena Park and Anaheim. It has almost no suggestions for services within the City
23 of Orange. This supports an inference that Orange wants unhoused persons,
24 particularly those with disabilities, to relocate to other cities.
25 46. Because Orange does not contract with any approved referral agency,
26 such as City Net, and will not approve Mary's Kitchen to make referrals, only

Orange police officers may make shelter referrals to a facility such as Bridges,

2 Compounding the fact that there are very limited beds available to begin with, this

3 makes it very difficult for a resident of Orange to get into any shelter.

4 47. During the pandemic, Bridges and Buena Park converted to "high-

5 barrier" shelters, limiting residents' daytime movement and refusing to

6 accommodate the needs of individuals with trauma or mental health conditions who

7 require the ability to leave during the day to reduce the trauma in the shelter

8 environment. Such restrictions are untenable for many survivors of domestid
9 violence or sexual assault. Placentia is the only "low-barrier" shelter, but it
10 prioritizes residents of Placentia. It is almost always full because of an arrangement

11 with Stanton during the OCCW litigation, contrary to the written settlement
12 agreement signed by Plaintiffs in OCCW.
13 48. The effort to close Mary's Kitchen is a final step in a decades-long
14 crusade against those living in poverty in Orange. It started with outlawing food
15 distribution in Heart Park, continued with the forced movement from the City into
16 the Santa Ana Riverbed, escalated during the pandemic with threats of arrest for

17 groups congregating in the park with food for distribution or meetings, and
18 culminating now with the attempted closure of the Kitchen to force residents out of
19 Orange into any other city. The City's targets are is significantly composed of people
20 of color, seniors, and people with disabilities. The City's motives are made clear by
21 its repeated comments about the undesirability of those with perceived mental illness
22 and concurrent campaign demagoguing them as criminals.
23 HOUSING ELEMENT COMPLIANCE IN THE CITY OF ORANGE

24 49. In 1982, California passed the California Housing Accountability Act.
25 California Government Code § 65589.5. Formerly known as the Anti-NIMBY law.
26 the statute bans discrimination against housing for lower-income households. The
27 FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT OBCLASS ACTION F.R.CIV.P. 23(B)(2) - 18

Case 8:21-cv-01483-DOC-JDE Document 44 Filed 01/03/22 Page 19 of 48 Page ID #:896

legislature declared that the provision of housing for all Californians is a "priority of

2 the highest order." §65580. This created a mandatory duty to provide for seniors,

3 people with disabilities, and low-income or unhoused individuals and families.

4 50. Under this provision, every city and county is required to adopt
General Plan governing land use and development projects in its jurisdiction. The

6 General Plan includes a "Housing Element," a one of seven mandatory General Plan
7 components that must be addressed and approved by the State of California's

8 Housing and Community Development Department ("HCD"). The Housing Element
9 is typically prepared every 8 years. Submission and approval of the Housing Element
10 by HCD is a necessary prerequisite for local governments to qualify for public

11 funding for various development programs.

12 51. The Orange City Council is the governing entity for the City. It is
13 responsible for developing and implementing the General Plan, including addressing
14 the need for housing and shelter for low-income and homeless individuals. Similarly,
15 it is responsible for ensuring that all city land use decisions comply with it's most
16 recently approved General Plan including the Housing Element. The City has
17 history of engaging in exclusionary zoning to limits the access of housing, services,
18 and shelters for its most vulnerable residents 16.

19 52. Each local entity must act consistently with its General Plan and
20 Housing Element. All land use decisions, zoning codes, the General Plan and all

21 other ordinances and policies affecting land use must be consistent with the housing

22

23

24

25 16 From 2014 2019 the City of Orange only permitted the development of 9 very low income units (11% of its expected regional need). While
26 it significantly outperformed its needed housing for moderate and above moderate

27 incomes permitting over 1,800 units for those higher income families.

element. §65580.5, §65860. All local land-use decisions, including site specific

2 plans, must be consistent with the adopted General Plan. §65454.

3 53. In 2007, Senate Bill 2 (SB2) extended the protections of the Housing

4 Accountability Act to emergency shelters and clarifying that it also covers
transitional and supportive housing. It imposed increased requirements on cities and

6 counties for low-income housing, emergency shelters and transitional/supportive
7 housing. Each city and county must evaluate its need for shelters and provide
8 comparison to available facilities to address the identified need. The emergency

9 shelter need must be assessed annually and seasonally. $65583(a)(7).
10 54. Each entity must also designate at least one location where a year-round

11 shelter may be operated without further approval by the local government. The
12 designated location(s) must have sufficient capacity to meet the entity's entire local
13 need for emergency shelter. The Housing Element details what restrictions may be
14 placed on operations within the SB2 zone. The designated location may then be used
15 by right, subject only to limited enumerated zoning restrictions. Mary's Kitchen sat
16 in the City's SB2-designated zone until the City modified its Housing Element.
17 Despite repeated requests by Mary's Kitchen to be a navigation center, the City has

18 not permitted inclusion of overnight services or expanded daytime services.

19 55. The express intent of SB2 was to expand the Housing Accountability
20 Act to prevent local entities from denying a proposal to create an eligible facility if
21 it is needed and otherwise consistent with local zoning and development standards,
22 The Legislature explicitly cabined a local entity's ability to impose hurdles such as
23 "a conditional use permit or any discretionary" approval. §65583(a)(4)(A).
24 56. Recognizing the "NIMBY" bias against unhoused persons, the statute
25 enumerates factors that may be imposed on a proposed facility, including the number

26 of beds or persons served, off-street parking restrictions, outside lighting, etc.
27 FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT OBCLASS ACTION F.R.CIV.P. 23(B)(2) - 20

Case 8:21-cv-01483-DOC-JDE Document 44 Filed 01/03/22 Page 21 of 48 Page ID #:898

§65583(a)(4)(A)(i)-(viii). The local entity has the burden to show that any

2 restrictions imposed on a proposed facility, and any permit processing standards
3 applied, are objective and directly advance the creation of emergency shelters. If the

4 local entity has an existing shelter that satisfies the statute's intent, a conditional use a

5 permit or similar prerequisite may be required to open a new shelter in the same

6 community. Otherwise, failure to allow a shelter when the statutory prerequisites are

7 met, without the required justification, is a violation of the law.

8 57. The Housing Accountability Act provides that an entity shall not

9 "disapprove" a proposed emergency shelter unless it makes written findings, based
10 on substantial evidence, that one of five exceptions are met. §65589.5(d): (I) the

11 jurisdiction has met or exceeded the need for emergency shelter identified in its
12 housing element; (2) the project would adversely impact the public health or safety
13 in a significant, quantifiable, direct and unavoidable way that cannot be mitigated;
14 (3) denial is required to comply with specified state or federal law and there is no

15 way to comply without rendering the shelter project infeasible; (4) the shelter is
16 proposed on land zoned for agriculture or resource preservation; and, (5) the shelter
17 is inconsistent with both the zoning ordinance and general plan land use designation
18 (but this basis is not allowed if the city failed to identify the mandated "by right"

19 zones, or that its zones have sufficient capacity to meet the need and failed to show
20 that the zones can accommodate at least one emergency shelter). §65589.5(d)(1)-(5).
21 58. Local entities may satisfy the mandate of SB2 in several ways.
22 Jurisdictions that are successfully implementing a supportive housing program

23 model under the entity's 10-year plan to End Chronic Homelessness are credited for
24 supportive housing units created under the 10-year plan if the entity can demonstrate
25 that the units are identified in the 10-year plan and are either currently vacant or have
26 all funding needed to construct the units during the planning period.

Case 8:21-cv-01483-DOC-JDE Document 44 Filed 01/03/22 Page 22 of 48 Page ID #:899

59. Local entities may also meet the requirements of SB2 by entering into

2 a multi-jurisdiction agreement provided that any emergency shelter will be opened

3 within two years of the start of the planning period. Gov. Code §65583(d)(1).

4 Entities involved in a joint project must adopt an agreement which, among other
conditions, assigns a portion of the new shelter to each jurisdiction. Specifically, the

6 agreement "shall allocate a portion of the new shelter capacity to each jurisdiction
7 as credit toward its emergency shelter need §65583(d)(1)(2). Also, the housing

8 element for each participating local government must set out the following: the
9 method for allocating bed capacity for the shelter; how the jurisdiction's emergency
10 shelter need is met by the proposed facility; the amount of the financial contribution

11 each entity will make for the development, operation and ongoing management of
12 the shelter; the amount and source of money to be contributed to the shelter; and,
13 finally, that the aggregate total capacity claimed by each participating entity in its
14 housing element is not greater than the total beds available at the shelter.
15 1$65583(d)(1)(3)(A)-(C). In other words, if several cities enter into a multi-
16 jurisdiction agreement for a 200-bed shelter, they may not each claim all 200 beds
17 as evidence that they have complied with the mandate to provide shelter resources.

18 60. The City submitted and was approved for its 5th Cycle Housing Element
19 relying upon Mary's Kitchen as its provider. In that housing element, the SB2 zone
20 was M1, M2, and P, including the site where Mary's Kitchen is located. That housing

21 element expired on October 15, 2021. Although the City submitted a draft 6th Cycle
22 Housing Element in July, Plaintiffs allege that the HCD informed the City by letter
23 that it was deficient, so there is no currently approved Housing Element. According

to HCD, the state agency that oversees compliance, the City of Orange is currently
2 out of compliance with the housing element law 17

3 61. Defendant City of Orange completely failed to meet its statutory burden

4 while denying Mary's Kitchen's requests to expand services and now acts to shut

5 down even the day shelter. The City has no emergency shelter and no exclusive use

6 of beds for a homeless adult anywhere in the County. Beds that are not for the

7 exclusive use of Orange may not be counted for Gov. Code § 65583(d)(1)(2) and

8 (3)(A)-(C). Finally, the City's municipal code limits the daytime services at

9 overnight shelters in ways that are not enumerated under SB2.

10 62. The shelter resources listed in the City's Housing Element are in other

11 cities or restrict services on a variety of bases. The State approved 5th Cycle Housing
12 Element lists services that a shelter may provide. The list is nearly identical to
13 services at Mary's Kitchen and not currently available elsewhere in the City. On

14 page H-59 the City specifically lists Mary's Kitchen as its provider. The day-shelter
15 cannot offer overnight beds since the City does not permit it and, even if there were
16 an overnight shelter, it could not offer the services at Mary's Kitchen as the City
17 code requires overnight shelters to close from 9:00AM to 5:00PM daily.18 The
18 Housing Element states that "the city shall provide support for nonprofit entities
19 to provide a range of services and housing opportunities for homeless persons in
20 Orange."l° All City actions must be in compliance with this approved plan.

63. Mary's Kitchen is in an area designated as an appropriate place for

2 shelter and identified as a site in the last approved General Plan as mandated by

3 Government Code §65583. Furthermore, without the ability to accommodate any

4 shelter for adults without children in zones M1 and M2, the SB2 prohibits the City
from denying a shelter based on zoning. Mary's Kitchen has offered to purchase this

6 site and surrounding land from the City to increase services and have greater wrap-
7 around capacity. A draft plan was submitted for the City to review the expansion,

8 Again, there is no lawful basis for the City to violate Government Code §65583.
9 64. California Government Code con 815.6 provides that: Where a public
10 entity is under a mandatory duty imposed by an enactment that is designed to protect

11 against the risk of a particular kind of injury, the public entity is liable for an injury
12 of that kind proximately caused by its failure to discharge the duty unless the public
13 entity establishes that it exercised reasonable diligence to discharge the duty.
14 65. The requirement to provide for the basic needs of low-income and
15 homeless individuals in the General Plan and to adhere to the government code is an
16 J"obligatory duty which a governmental entity is required to perform," not
17 permissive one. Failure to meet this duty gives rise to liability whether the
18 underlying enactment allows a private a right of action or is self-executing. The term
19 "enactment" includes "a constitutional provision, statute, charter provision,
20 ordinance or regulation." Cal. Govt. Code §810.6.

21 66. The City of Orange municipal code, 17.13.040 requires clients of

22 traditional overnight shelters vacate the facility each day and limits services to 45
23 days. The average time to access services in the Orange County Coordinated Entry
24 system is significantly more than 45 days. The failure of the City to meet its

25 obligations under the Housing Accountability Act falls particularly hard on disabled
26 individuals. They face the additional burden of being required to travel considerable

distances to obtain the most basic of social services because there are no such

2 services in their communities. They must carry all their possessions with them, more

3 often making them a target of local law enforcement as they attempt to navigate the

4 route to obtain services in the few areas of the County that offer it.
67. Not only would forcing the Plaintiff class to travel to other cities for

6 services currently available in one location at Mary's Kitchen constitute an unlawful

7 burden on persons with disabilities, it would also create potentially significant direct

8 and indirect physical impacts on the environment that must be considered..

9 CLASS ALLEGATIONS

10 68. The claims set forth in this action are brought by Plaintiffs on their own

11 behalf and those similarly situated persons pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P 23(b)(2).

12 69. The Class is defined as:

13 a. All persons experiencing homelessness in the City of Orange.

14 b. All disabled persons experiencing homelessness, including those

15 diagnosed with severe and persistent mental illness ("SPMI') and qualified for Full

16 Service Partnership ("FSP") placements, who have not received reasonable

17 accommodations for their disability.

18 70. The members of the class are so numerous that joinder of all members

19 is impracticable, if not impossible. On information and belief, Plaintiffs allege that

20 members of the primary class will exceed 330 in number. On the same basis.

21 Plaintiffs allege that the sub-class will exceed 110 individuals, or 30 percent of the

22 total persons experiencing homelessness in the City and served by Mary's Kitchen.l

23 71. There are common questions of law and fact that predominate over any

24 questions affecting only individual class members in this instance.

25 72. Among the common questions of law and fact are the following:

Case 8:21-cv-01483-DOC-JDE Document 44 Filed 01/03/22 Page 26 of 48 Page ID #:903

73. Whether Defendant met its statutory duty to provide low-income

2 housing and a range of shelter services required by Government Code §65589.5;

3 74. Whether Defendant's failure to provide programs or services to assess

4 the need and make reasonable accommodations for unhoused people with disabilities

5 violates and continues to violate Plaintiffs' state and federal statutory rights;

6 75. Whether Defendant's planned actions will create a danger to the lives

7 of unhoused people in the City;

8 76. Whether injunctive relief restraining further unlawful acts by

9 Defendant should be ordered by the Court and, if so, the nature of such relief;

10 77. The Class Representatives will fairly and adequately protect the

11 interests of the Class. They have retained counsel who are experienced and
12 competent in class-action and civil rights litigation. The Class Representatives have

13 no interests that are adverse or antagonistic to those of other Class members.
14 78. A class action is superior to any other method to secure a fair and
15 efficient adjudication of this controversy. As the relief sought for the class is
16 injunctive in nature, the burden and expense make it impractical for class members
17 to seek redress individually for the wrongs done to them. No class damages are
18 sought. Individual litigation by each class member would necessarily burden the
19 judicial system and run the risk of inconsistent judgments.
20 79. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and on that basis allege that the City
21 acted on grounds generally applicable to the class, making injunctive or declaratory
22 relief appropriate for the class as a whole.

23 PLAINTIFFS

24 80. Plaintiff MARY'S KITCHEN (Mary's") is a nonprofit 501(c)(3)
25 organization. Its mission is to provide basic services to support and enhance the
26 quality of life for the economically marginalized and unhoused people in Orange,
27 FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT OBCLASS ACTION F.R.CIV.P. 23(B)(2) - 26

Case 8:21-cv-01483-DOC-JDE Document 44 Filed 01/03/22 Page 27 of 48 Page ID #:904

The organization operates through donations and is a low-barrier provider open for

2 daytime services six days per week. Mary's is predominately staffed by volunteers,
3 including some whose lived experience and current housing status inform their

4 compassion. Volunteers are called to provide services and assist guests to overcome

5 barriers to returning to a stable means of support.

6 81. Gloria Suess is the CEO of Mary's Kitchen. Now in her 80's, Ms. Suess

7 has led the organization almost every day since the founder, Mary's passing in 2003.

8 She engages with each person she meets and helps them connect with available

9 resources. She observes an estimated 300-400 people in any month of 2021 who rely
10 upon Mary's Kitchen for life-sustaining services not available elsewhere in the City,
11 Some people visit daily, others only a few days per week.

12 82. For many years, Ms. Suess observed actions taken by the cities and
13 county to exclude those experiencing homelessness from their jurisdictions,
14 including removal of benches that the individuals could lawfully sit on, restricting
15 parking hours in the area to deter people living in their vehicles, increasing police
16 and private security presence, and other tactics to pressure people to leave the City
17 and surrounding area. She is acutely familiar with available local social services and
18 knows of no place in and around the City where people with marginalized income,

19 or housing insecurity can obtain the services offered at Mary's Kitchen.
20 83. Based on nearly two decades of experience and countless hours, she is

21 aware that a significant portion of the guests at Mary's Kitchen have a variety of
22 disabilities - physical, cognitive, medical, mental - some compounded by thein
23 status as seniors. She has formed the belief that, as the result of the Defendant's
24 policies, practices and customs, and those of the Defendant's agents and employees,

F hygiene needs, and addresses their food insecurities. The community members

2 without a fixed residence would be without adequate food, water, and a whole host

3 of other critical social essentials if they did not have access to Mary's Kitchen.

4 84. Plaintiff RICHARD HANCOX has lived in the City of Orange on and
5 off for over seven years and has been coming to Mary's Kitchen during that time!

6 He suffers from multiple disabilities including a type of skin cancer that substantially

on many of the 7 limits his vision, as well as a mental health condition. He relies

8 services at Mary's including food, laundry, donated clothes and cell phone charging

9 to ensure he does not miss lifesaving medical appointments, showers and hygiene,
10 mail, and connections to medical providers. Beyond that, Mary's Kitchen provides

11 him with respite from the unyielding stress of life on the streets. Mr. Hancox has no
12 alternative for the vital, life-sustaining services provided by Mary's Kitchen. To date

13 shelters in other cities have been unable to accommodate his mental health needs.

14 No City or County service provider offered him any housing opportunities. The
15 support at Mary's Kitchen allows him to get the medical care he needs.

16 85. He is diagnosed with major depressive order. When he has stayed in
17 shelters, his condition is severely exacerbated by the environment, causing

18 substantial anxiety and mistrust. Despite multiple requests for long-term housing, he

19 has not been offered any appropriate placements, let alone any opportunities. He is
20 concerned that if he is forced back into a shelter, his disabilities will be increased.

21 86. On many occasions, Orange Police officers have directed Mr. Hancox
22 to leave or avoid public spaces. Sometimes he was waiting to enter in front of Mary's

23 Kitchen. Other times he was woken up while sleeping in a public space and
24 instructed to move along. Yet other times he was simply sitting on a bench in a public

25 space and directed to leave because police felt he was loitering. To avoid harassment

26 for waiting in front of Mary's Kitchen, Mr. Hancox began waiting at a bus stop about

two blocks away. The City then removed the bench and shade cover, putting him at

2 greater risk in his ongoing battle with skin cancer.

3 87. Plaintiff LEASA POLLARD became homeless while fleeing domestic

4 violence. She later experienced sexual assault in a shelter. She has considerable
trauma from those events. Having a safe place during the day is critical. She has at

6 times had employment while homeless but struggled to maintain employment.
7 Instead, she is now a volunteer at Mary's Kitchen. In a safe place that understands

8 her trauma she is able to gain experience and work toward stability.
9 88. Ms. Pollard relies upon Mary's Kitchen for services including mail to
10 receive her benefits, showers, nutritious meals, and safety from the dangers faced by

11 a single woman without housing. She is certain that she and other unhoused women
12 will be in immediate and life-threatening danger if they lose access to Mary's
13 Kitchen, where they find a safe environment free from sexual harassment.
14 89. Plaintiff HORACIO AGUILAR does not have any hope that he will
15 be given any options other than Mary's Kitchen because he does not qualify for most
16 housing programs. Mr. Aguilar is disabled and does not meet the requirements
17 necessary for stable employment. His disability is aggravated by the noise and
18 crowding in congregate shelters.
19 90. He relies on Mary's Kitchen for food, water, showers, respite, and more.

20 He is certain that without Mary's, his primary source of income of recycling would
21 not be enough to even replace the food he gets, let alone all of the other services. Mr.
22 Aguilar has limited mobility and cannot physically travel great distances to get
23 different services or see a doctor. He waits at Mary's Kitchen for assistance when
24 doctors visit and believes his life would be in substantial danger and his health would
25 be far worse if Mary's Kitchen was not available to him.

91. Plaintiff STARLA ACOSTA has been in Orange for three years. While

2 she has tried many times to get into different shelter programs in other cities, the
3 congregate setting has exacerbated her disabilities. They also put her at higher risk

4 for complications related to her chronic medical condition. Ms. Acosta relies on
nutritious food support from Mary's Kitchen to meet her basic needs. She visits

6 Mary's Kitchen daily. The respite Mary's Kitchen provides is critical to her mental
7 health. She also relies on the doctors that visit Mary's to supplement her
8 comprehensive care needs.

9 92. Ms. Acosta uses almost all the services available at Mary's Kitchen.
10 The City has not offered her any housing solutions or assistance. While she does

11 have the safety of her vehicle overnight, she struggles to find safe places to rest or
12 access bathrooms, showers, and more. This is especially important given her many

13 medical needs. Without Mary's Kitchen, she believes her life would be in danger.
14 93. Plaintiff TODD CHRISTOPHER is a Navy veteran with an honorable

15 discharge. He served for 16 years from 1976 until 1992 and obtained Veterans
16 Affairs Supportive Housing seven years ago. Despite VASH, Mr. Christopher's
17 housing has been unstable. His first placement ended when compensation for a rent

18 increase was denied by the government agency, next due to a conflict with neighbors,

19 and last when he did not have sufficient income to pay his portion of the rent. When
20 he falls back into homelessness, he turns to Mary's Kitchen for critical support. He

21 knows many other veterans who similarly rely on the services.
22 94. Mr. Christopher relies on Mary's for food, showers, mail, phone

23 charging, access to visiting doctors, and other services. He suffers from a medical
24 condition but lost his medication when he was evicted from the Veterans housing
25 placement. No City programs have offered to help him replace his medicines So he
26 turns to Mary's Kitchen to assist him with his basic needs. Because of his limited

resources, he travels to Costa Mesa to get food on Sundays when Mary's is closed.

2 The trip is a difficult one for him and would be even more difficult to make on

3 daily basis if Mary's closed. He does not know any way he could meet his needs

4 without Mary's Kitchen other than to leave the city.

5 95. Plaintiff DON TERRY is a Vietnam veteran with an honorable

6 discharge. Mr. Terry has been without housing since the 1990s. He has a Substance
7 Use Disorder. He does not have a case manager and mainly relies on Mary's Kitchen

8 for support to manage the SUD. Despite his condition, he successfully complies with
9 the strict rules at Mary's Kitchen and helps to ensure others do the same. That
10 includes ensuring that no drugs or alcohol come through the gates onto the property,

11 The availability of support without judgment at Mary's helps him with his SUD.
12 96. Due to the repercussions and trauma from his time in Vietnam, he

13 cannot stay in a congregate shelter. He does not fit well with other available support
14 options, and no other provider offers or provides the same level of nutrition and
15 support without judgement as Mary's. He is motivated to keep going by the help he
16 gets from the good hearts of the Christians who volunteer at Mary's. He and others
17 like him who do not fit into any other existing programs rely on Mary's Kitchen for
18 mail, nutrition, support, clothes, and more.

19 97. Defendant CITY OF ORANGE ("CITY") is a government entity with
20 the capacity to sue and be sued. The departments of ORANGE include the Orange

21 Police Department. Employees of ORANGE engaged in the acts complained of
22 herein pursuant to the policies, practices and customs of the CITY.

12 complained of herein was the product of a policy and practice of the City, and was

13 not the product of accident or inadvertence, or random. In so doing, Defendant were

104. The individual plaintiffs and the Plaintiff class are without housing, and,

2 consequently, have no place to be that is not a public place. As a matter of black
3 letter law, and based on their status as unhoused persons, Plaintiffs presence in

4 public places, including near shelters, is not and may not be made unlawful conduct.

5 B. Procedural and Substantive Benefit Interest

6 105. The City's actions in relation to Mary's Kitchen, including designating

7 space and relying upon them for government direction to people in need, conferred

8 a government benefit upon Mary's Kitchen and those who rely on the Kitchen.
9 106. The Plaintiffs have a property interest in these government benefits and
10 programs and were entitled to a fair and equitable process for providing and denying
11 access to such benefits and programs. The City did not provide any process by which
12 Plaintiffs could dispute the termination.
13 107. Plaintiff Mary's Kitchen was denied due process of law repeatedly,
14 inter alia, when the City refused to consider its request for shelter operations in the
15 City in a zone approved for such facilities "by right," as well as when the City
16 recently issued a termination notice without following state-mandated requirements
17 for written documentation of the specific items required to be address by the state
18 before a shelter permit may be denied or revoked, and when the City's termination

19 was based on unconstitutional conditions to restrict, exclude or otherwise control
20 persons with disabilities, specifically mental disabilities without lawful justification.
21 108. Plaintiff Mary's Kitchen had no adequate notice since the City did not
22 file the required statutory notice and thus no opportunity to a fair hearing, before the
23 City unilaterally cancelled the contract for the decades-long use of the property as
24 shelter. On information and belief, Plaintiff alleges that the reason why Defendant

25 City has taken this adverse action is because of the services provided by Mary's

26 Kitchen to a class of persons marginalized by society.

Case 8:21-cv-01483-DOC-JDE Document 44 Filed 01/03/22 Page 34 of 48 Page ID #:911

109. The Orange Municipal Code 3.08.095 provides an explicit process for

2 making the decision to end a City contract. The termination notice issued to Mary's

3 Kitchen was issued and signed by the City Manager without following the express

4 process set forth in the Code and without authority as required by the Code.

5 110. There was no public meeting or action to delegate authority to terminate

6 the contract the City Manager. Orange County municipal code requires that contracts

7 not specifically covered by the Code be approved by the City Council and signed by

8 the Mayor. The only authority vested in the City Manager with respect to the contract
9 with Mary's Kitchen was to renew it in 2024, not terminate it in 2021.

10 111. The majority of City land use decisions must be made in a public

11 meeting by the City Counsel. All past agreements with Mary's Kitchen were
12 properly signed by the Mayor after a vote by the City Council. With no authority to
13 act, no public meeting, and therefore no valid notice, the City's action to seize the
14 land was without authority.

15 112. Whether the land use agreement is a lease or license under the law is
16 not determinative. No matter what it is called, the agreement does not exempt a city
17 from compliance with the Constitution, including due process.
18 113. The reasons given by the City to justify the termination are

19 discriminatory and target individuals with mental health conditions. They also target
20 community that is overwhelmingly people with other disabilities. These reasons

21 may not be a lawful basis for termination.

22 114. Due process is required when the government seeks to terminate
23 public benefit conferred by a government entity. Plaintiffs were denied procedural
24 due process before the City terminated the use agreement based on its own alleged
25 property interest with disregard for the benefit it conferred on Mary's Kitchen and
26 its guests. Plaintiffs have a constitutionally protected property interest. After

granting even a simple permit, less than a lease or license, a City cannot revoke it

2 for improper reasons, or without appropriate procedural safeguards. Based on the

3 long history here, Mary's Kitchen continued to invest in the property in 2021,
4 bolstering their property interest and right to pre-deprivation hearing.

5 115. Unless the Defendant is enjoined from continuing its course of conduct

6 for engagement with the Plaintiff class, Plaintiffs will suffer ongoing and irreparable

7 injury to their rights. Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief to prevent these injuries.

8 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

9 Right To Be Free of Unconstitutional Conditions; 42 U.S.C. § 1983
10 Due Process and Equal Protection
11 116. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate the allegations set forth in the
12 preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth hereat.
13 117. For more than a century, the Supreme Court has instructed that, even
14

15 though a person may have no right to a valuable government benefit, and even
though the benefit may be denied for many reasons, it may not be denied for a reason
16 that is unconstitutional. Donald v. Phila. & Reading Coal & Iron Co., 241 U.S. 329.
17 332 (1916) (business license). This principle applies with particular force when the
18 benefit at issue involves individual liberties, property rights, land-use and equal
19 protection. Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 597 (1972) (employment); Nolan v.
20 Cal. Coastal Comm'n, 483 U.S. 825, 837 (1987) (building permit unlawfully
21 conditioned on compelled public right-of-access across property); Koontz v. St.
22 Johns River Water Mgmt. Dist., 570 U.S. 595, 604 (2013) (land-use permits).
23 118. The City sought to impose unconstitutional conditions on Mary's
24 Kitchen as a condition to the two-decades old agreement with the City for the use of
25 the property. The government may not impose a choice between a government
26 benefit and constitutionally protected rights.

Case 8:21-cv-01483-DOC-JDE Document 44 Filed 01/03/22 Page 36 of 48 Page ID #:913

119. No matter how denominated, the use agreement between Orange and

2 Mary's Kitchen is a government benefit within the doctrine of unconstitutional

3 conditions.

4 120. The City's demands that Mary's Kitchen interfere with lawful conduct

5 by its guests and others in public places and restrict disabled persons as

6 requirement to maintain operations are unconstitutional conditions.

7 121. The City's termination of the benefits provided to Mary's Kitchen and

8 its guests for more than two decades based on the alleged failure to implement
9 unconstitutional conditions and laws violates the rights of each Plaintiff and the
10 doctrine of unconstitutional conditions.

11 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

13 Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment (42 U.S.C.g1983)

14 122. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate the allegations set forth in the
15 preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth hereat.
16 123. The City is aware that Mary's Kitchen is the only provider for adults
17 without minor children in Orange. The City manager issued a notice of termination
18 demanding the property be vacated by September 18, 2021. The City has no other
19 facility that offers the same minimum wrap-around services.
20 124. Without access to nutrition, water, restrooms, mail, clothes, medical
21 support, hygiene and more, Plaintiffs lives will be in immediate danger during the
22 ongoing pandemic, winter rain and summer heat. Without access to mail, Plaintiffs
23 will be unable to received expected items from the Social Security Administration,
24 DMV, state benefits, employers, VA medication, and others necessary for survival,
25 Many persons receive their benefits and medications via mail at Mary's Kitchen and
26 have no alternative.

125. The City is well aware of the danger that will result for a very

2 vulnerable population by the closure of Mary's Kitchen. Specifically, the City is

3 aware of the increased deaths among unhoused persons in the City during the time

4 that Mary's Kitchen was closed or provided limited services because of pandemic
protocols and restrictions. Yet the City has been deliberately indifferent to these

6 likely consequences of its actions.

7 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

8 California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)
9

10 126. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate the allegations set forth in the

11 preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.

12 127. Every discretionary action approved or carried out by the City,

13 including by the City Manager, requires consideration of whether the California

14 Environmental Quality Act applies. For any CEQA determination made by a non-

15 elected decision-maker, including that CEQA does not apply, the City is obligated

16 to provide for an appeal of the environmental determination to the City's elected

17 decision-making body.

18 128. The City did not adequately assess its discretionary decision to

19 terminate the lease of Mary's Kitchen. The City did not certify a negative declaration,

20 mitigated declaration, environmental impact report, or provide notice to the public

21 that it considered termination of Mary's Kitchen's land use agreement to be exempt

22 from CEQA so that the determination could be appealed to the City's elected

23 decision-making body.

24 129. After the termination notice issued, the City Council held a closed

25 session meeting without any agendized notice that it would discuss the Mary's

Kitchen situation, in violation of the Brown Act. On information and belief, the City

2 Council ratified the unauthorized action by the City Manager.
3 130. The premature termination of Mary's Kitchen's 2019 land-use

4 agreement is a discretionary action to which CEQA applies and for which no

5 categorical or statutory exemption applies. The City's action required evaluation of

6 potentially significant environmental impacts and a transparent public process to

7 allow participation of interested community members in the decision-making

8 process.

9 131. Here, the City failed to evaluate the potential direct and indirect

10 environmental impacts of an action that would displace hundreds of people, remove

11 | necessary services including bathrooms and showers, allow repurposing of the
12 property that has served as the City's Day shelter for decades, and which will likely
13 require development of similar homeless services facilities in presently unidentified
14 locations. The City failed to provide any opportunity for public comment or appeal
15 of its environmental determination that the project is not subject to CEQA to its

16 elected decisionmaker.

17 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

18 First, Fourth. Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments; 42 U.S.C. 1983

19 132. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate the allegations set forth in the

20 /preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth hereat.

21 133. When Mary's Kitchen is not open, Plaintiffs have nowhere to go. They

22 often wait in public space in the city of Orange, sometimes outside of Mary's

23 Kitchen. They associate with other people with disabilities and unhoused persons,

24 make appointments to meet case workers, or wait for shuttles to County services.

25 134. Prior to the initiation of this action, the Orange Police Department,

26 subdivision of the Defendant City, repeatedly and deliberately enforced a policy to

stop, detain, interrogate and order members of the Plaintiff class to move along from
2 public places, where they have a First and Fourteenth Amendment right to be, or

3 face criminal citation and prosecution. These practices constitute unlawful seizures

4 as they were done without reasonable suspicion or probable cause to believe that the

5 individual had or was about to commit a crime other than a purported violation of

6 an unconstitutional Municipal Code provision prohibiting "loitering" near a shelter. a
7 135. Plaintiffs, as everyone else, have a First Amendment a right to be present

8 in a public space, to "loiter" in a public space for no reason and to be free from threat,

9 intimidation or coercion because they are homeless. Since Papachristou
10 Jacksonville, 405 U.S. 156 (1972), the First Amendment right of "vagrants" and

11 other purported "undesirables" to "loiter" in public places has been affirmed.
12 136. The Orange Police Department policy and practice of threatening
13 persons who appear to be homeless and are in public places, especially outside
14 |Mary's Kitchen, to leave or face criminal process is a policy, practice or custom
15 attributable to the Defendant City. Monell v. Dep't of Soc. Svcs., 436 U.S 658 (1978).
16 137. There is an actual controversy between Plaintiffs and Defendant
17 concerning the lawfulness of this policy, practice or custom. Plaintiffs desire
18 ljudicial determination of their rights and duties and Defendant's obligations.
19 138. As a direct consequence of Defendant's past and threatened future

20 actions, Plaintiffs suffered and will continue to suffer a violation of their

21 constitutional rights and damages in the form of pain and suffering.

23 Equal protection

Case 8:21-cv-01483-DOC-JDE Document 44 Filed 01/03/22 Page 40 of 48 Page ID #:917

140. Defendant's conduct, as described herein, constitutes a denial of equal

2 protection to the Plaintiff class based on their status as homeless persons perceived

3 to be disabled and present in public spaces. The equal protection clause prohibits

4 Defendant from basing access to its programs on perceived attributes of the class.

5 141. As individuals with disabilities who are unhoused or housing insecure,

6 they have been subjected to selective and discriminatory application of the laws and
7 programs, with both a discriminatory intent and purpose. The Plaintiffs have been

8 targeted for selective and discriminatory application of the laws and programs as
9 result of bias, negative attitudes, animosity and fear because of the high percentage
10 of disabilities, including psychological diagnoses, among the unsheltered and
11 shelter-insecure community, all done with the intent to harm a politically unpopular
12 group. Plaintiffs and the class that they represent have been intentionally treated
13 differently from others similarly situated and with no rational basis for the difference
14 in treatment as a result of Defendant's willful, malicious and unlawful acts.

15 142. As a direct and proximate consequence of Defendant's actions,
16 Plaintiffs suffered and continue to suffer a loss of constitutional and statutory rights
17 and pain and suffering. The individual Plaintiffs are entitled to compensatory

18 damages and the Plaintiff class is entitled to injunctive and declaratory relief.

government entity knows or should know that its conduct is substantially likely to

2 result in harm to a protected right and, nonetheless, continues its unlawful action.

3 145. Plaintiffs in the disabled class are qualified individuals with disabilities

4 within the meaning of the ADA. Despite knowing this, the City has not provided any

5 reasonable accommodation to meet their needs.

6 146. The City engaged in intentional discrimination against the class based

7 on their disabilities by intentionally and arbitrarily denying them access to benefits
8 and programs for which they were otherwise eligible. The City is targeting those
9 with severe mental health conditions without taking any steps to provide for their
10 needs. In at least one case, a person with such a condition was sent to Mary's Kitchen

11 from BeWell, a County provider, when BeWell was unable to provide services
12 beyond a limited program and had no other exit plan. Families from the County
13 shelter for families with minor children also frequented Mary's Kitchen for services.
14 People with disabilities like Plaintiff Hancox were directed to move along from
15 public space despite visible disability related need for reasonable accommodations.
16 147. In doing the acts complained of herein, Defendant has acted knowingly
17 and with deliberate indifference to Plaintiffs' disabilities and the harm substantially

18 likely to occur to them as the result of Defendant's unlawful policies and practices.

19 Defendant has accomplished these unlawful acts by using federal and state funds in
20 ways that discriminate against qualified disabled persons.

149. The Defendant's conduct, as described herein, interferes by threats,

2 intimidation, or coercion, or attempts to interfere by threats, intimidation, or

3 coercion, with the exercise and enjoyment of Plaintiffs' rights as secured by the

4 United States Constitution, laws of the United States, and rights secured by the

5 Constitution and laws of the State of California.

6 150. Defendant engaged in concerted and repeated conduct to cite and arrest

7 Plaintiffs under unconstitutional ordinances, on their face and as applied, and

8 threatened to cite and arrest them repeatedly. Defendant engaged in coercive and
9 intimidating tactics by conducting unwarranted stops and collecting information on
10 Plaintiffs to justify termination of the agreement between the City and Mary's

11 Kitchen and force the Plaintiff class out of the City jurisdiction. Defendant also
12 engaged in coercive conduct to force Mary's Kitchen to accept and institute
13 unconstitutional restrictions to maintain the benefit afforded by the use of the
14 property.

15 151. Defendant's actions are the proximate cause of the harm suffered by the
16 Plaintiffs, who are entitled to compensation for their pain and suffering.
17 152. Defendant's continued use of threats, intimidation, coercion against

18 Plaintiffs and the class they represent is ongoing and will continue unless and until
19 the Court enjoins this unlawful conduct.
20 NINTH CAUSE OF ACTION

21 Violation of Ca. Gov Code §65580 et. seq.; § 815.6; 14th Amendment,
22 Failure to Comply with Mandatory Duty: Compliance with Housing Element
23

24 153. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate the allegations set forth in the

25 proceeding paragraphs as though fully set forth hereat.

27 FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT OBCLASS ACTION F.R.CIV.P. 23(B)(2) - 42

Case 8:21-cv-01483-DOC-JDE Document 44 Filed 01/03/22 Page 43 of 48 Page ID #:920

154. A city cannot make land use decisions, including termination of a land

2 use agreement, that are not consistent with the City's General Plan. According to

3 HCD, the City's Housing Element is out of compliance with the requirements of

4 SB2, Gov. Code §65582. The City's 5th Cycle Housing Element and General Plan,

5 submitted to the California HCD as required by law, expressly relied upon the

6 operation of Mary's Kitchen to satisfy statutory requirements. Any decision to
7 terminate or interrupt those services is not consistent with the General Plan and

8 results in the City being "out of compliance" with the Housing Element mandate.
9 155. This renders the General Plan inadequate. Local Governments with
10 invalid General Plans may not issue development permits or make decisions for any

11 project in the City and the Court may terminate local governments' residential and
12 non-residential permitting authority unless and until a General Plan and Housing
13 Element are found to be in substantial compliance with state law. If an entity fails to
14 come into compliance, Courts may multiply damages by a factor of six, appoint
15 receiver to remedy Housing Element deficiencies, and force compliance.
16 156. Without an adequate Housing Element, the City is without the power
17 to make the required findings of consistency.
18 157. Government Code §65860 requires all City action related to land use to

19 be consistent with its General Plan. The General Plan has been aptly described as
20 the "constitution for all future developments" within the city. The consistency

21 doctrine is "the linchpin of California's land use and development laws; it is the
22 principle which infuse[s] the concept of planned growth with the force of law."
23 158. A city therefore must take action consistent with its Housing Element,
24 a part of its General Plan. The Defendant City's last approved Housing Element
25 expressly relied upon Mary's Kitchen to meet the mandate. In fact, Mary's Kitchen
26 was the only listed service provider. The City's Housing Element lists the wrap

Case 8:21-cv-01483-DOC-JDE Document 44 Filed 01/03/22 Page 44 of 48 Page ID #:921

around services permitted at a shelter. Within the city, they are only provided only

2 by Mary's Kitchen. While the day-shelter does not have traditional "beds"20 it does
3 provide all the shelter services to those forced to move during the night and rest

4 during the day due to the lack of shelter in the city. The same document submitted

5 by the City and approved by the State details that "the city shall provide support for

6 nonprofit entities ... to provide a range of services and housing opportunities for the

7 homeless persons in Orange." The City's obligation is not only to meet the minimum

8 standard under SB2, but also to ensure all actions are consistent with its plan.

9 159. Despite the obligation to take all actions in compliance with the
10 Housing Element and General Plan, the Defendant's planned actions would

11 adversely impact the nonprofit and remove the range of services at the day shelter
12 rather than meet the mandate to support and supplement these services. It would go
13 directly against its last approved Housing Element. The harm of this action is

14 compounded by the lack of compliance with the minimum requirements of SB2.
15 160. The City's plan to replace services offered at Mary's Kitchen fails the
16 consistency doctrine. If the action will frustrate the General Plan's goals, as here, it

17 is inconsistent with the General Plan. The City makes no affirmative promise to

18 mitigate adverse effects on the Housing Element as a result of the closure of Mary's a

19 Kitchen.

20 161. Since the filing of this litigation, Mary's Kitchen and its realtor have
21 searched all properties for sale in the City within the SB2-designated zone. They
22 have further contacted, through their realtor, all viable and properly zoned properties
23 not for sale to offer a cash purchase. As of today, no properties in the SB2 zone are

willing to sell their land for any use as a shelter. To comply with SB2, the City must

2 expand the zoned area to include properties that are viable for purchase and

3 development of a shelter and exempt all SB2 property from the restrictions of
4 Municipal Code 17.13.040 §JJ.

5 162. Absent a plan that meets all requirements and is approved by HCD, or

6 otherwise demonstrated to be in substantial compliance with the Housing Element

7 a and a valid General Plan approved by HCD, the City remains out of compliance.

8 163. Civil Code co. 815.6 provides for liability against a public entity when;

9 (1) the entity violates an enactment; (2) the plaintiffs are in the class of persons
10 protected by the enactment; (3) the enactment is intended to protect the type of injury

11 complained of by the plaintiffs; (4) the violation of the enactment is the proximate
12 cause of the injury; and, (5) the public entity did not exercise reasonable diligence
13 in discharging its duty established by the enactment.
14 164. An enactment includes a federal or state constitutional provision,
15 statute, charter provision, ordinance or properly adopted regulation.
16 165. Government Code § 65583 et seq. is a statutory enactment within the
17 meaning of Civil Code § 815.6, imposing mandatory duties designed to protect
18 against the injuries alleged herein. Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class are persons

19 protected by these enactments.
20 166. As a direct and proximate cause of the aforementioned acts of

21 Defendant, Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class suffered injuries in that they were denied
22 access to existing facilities on grounds that were arbitrary, capricious and

23 discriminatory, were unable to obtain appropriate housing or shelter and were
24 threatened, cited and, in some instances arrested, for living in public places when
25 there was no available shelter or housing.

4 TENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

5 ULTRA VIRES ACTS

6 168. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate the allegations set forth in the
7 proceeding paragraphs as though fully set forth hereat.

8 169. The conduct engaged in by Defendant in terminating the benefit
9 provided to Plaintiff Mary's Kitchen for more than two decades is the result of an
10 ultra vires act by the City Manager of the City of Orange. The City Manager
11 unilaterally issued a notice to Mary's Kitchen prematurely terminating its lease with
12 the City nearly three years before expiration of its five-year term despite having no
13 delegated authority to terminate the contract, and with no involvement of the City
14 Council or Mayor, who hold all legislative and executive powers of the City of
15 Orange not delegated to the City Manager or other city officers.
16 170. Ultra vires actions related to contracts with public agencies are
17 generally void.

18 171. Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class seek injunctive and declaratory relief
19 that the City Manager's action prematurely terminating Mary's Kitchen's lease is
20 ultra vires and void.

21 ELEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

22 Violation of California Code of Regulations §12060

23 172. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate the allegations set forth in the

24 proceeding paragraphs as though fully set forth hereat.

25 173. The City has discriminated on the basis of disabilities of the guests of

26 Mary's Kitchen by terminating use of the facility for the benefit of unhoused persons.

174. California Code of Regulations §12060, "Practices with

2 Discriminatory Effect," makes unlawful a practice that actually or predictably results

3 in a disparate impact on a group of individuals, or creates, increases, reinforces, 0r
4 perpetuates segregated housing patterns, based on membership in a protected class.

5 175. Here, the City attempts to push unhoused people with disabilities out

6 of its borders by shuttering the only provider for no-income/low-income single

7 adults, creating a disparate impact on a protected class.

8 176. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's actions, and those of its

9 agents, Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class did and continue to experience direct injury,
10 including pain and suffering.

11 WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray as follows:
12 1. For a declaratory judgment that the policies, practices and conduct
13 alleged herein violate Plaintiffs' rights under the federal and state constitutions and
14 statutory laws;
15 2. For an order enjoining the Defendant City from early termination of the
16 contract with Mary's Kitchen until Defendant provides a hearing on the alleged
17 reasons for termination and demonstrates a full and complete alternative to replace
18 the resources offered at Mary's Kitchen or provides an alternative location for
19 Mary's Kitchen;
20 3. For a declaratory judgment that Defendant failed to meet its mandatory
21 duty to provide for homeless and low-income residents of the City, as codified in
22 Government Code §§65580 et seq.;
23 4. For an order enjoining Defendant City from engaging in any residential
24 or non-residential permitting, including prohibiting the City from issuing any
25 building permits, development permits, zoning exemptions, or other entitlements in
26 commercial areas until its housing policies, including the ordinance and zoning for
