BAY CONSERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION, a State 2 Agency.

3 Respondent and Defendant,

OAKLAND ATHLETICS INVESTMENT
5 GROUP, LLC,

6 Real Party in Interest.

7

8 Petitioners East Oakland Stadium Alliance, et al. bring this petition for writ of mandate
and complaint for declaratory relief against Respondent and Defendant, the San Francisco Bay

10 Conservation and Development Commission (the "Commission" or "BCDC"), and Real Party in

11 Interest the Oakland Athletics Investment Group, LLC ("AIG"), and for their petition and

12 complaint allege as follows:

13 INTRODUCTION

14 1. On June 30, 2022, the Commission adopted Resolution No. 2022-02, approving

15 Bay Plan Amendment No. 2-19 ("BPA 2-19" or the "Amendment"), amending the San Francisco

16 Bay Plan ("Bay Plan") and Seaport Plan to remove the Port Priority Use ("PPU") designation for

17 56 acres at the Howard Terminal in the Port of Oakland, in order to accommodate AIG's

18 proposed baseball stadium and mixed-use development project at Howard Terminal (the "HT

19 Project" or "Project"). The instant action challenges and seeks to set aside Respondent's adoption

20 of BPA 2-19 and the Final Environmental Assessment ("Final EA") approved by the Commission

21 on numerous grounds, including violation of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA")

22 (Pub. Res. Code § 21000, et seq.) and the Commission's certified regulatory program under

23 CEQA, as well as the McAteer-Petris Act (Gov. Code §§ 66600 et seq.) and common law

24 conflict-of-interest principles.

25 2. In early 2019, AIG applied to the Commission to initiate BPA 2-19 for the HT

26 Project. BPA 2-19 is one of many governmental agency approvals that are needed for the HT

27

28 BCDC's planning activities have been certified by the Secretary for Natural Resources as a CEQA-equivalent regulatory program. See 14 Cal. Code Regs. 15251(h).
2.
VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 Project. BCDC, and the City of Oakland ("City") serving in the role of the Lead Agency under

2 CEQA for the Project, have recognized that BPA 2-19 is a "project-driven" Bay Plan amendment,

3 and an essential "first step" for the HT Project to go forward.

4 3. The purpose of BPA 2-19 is to remove the PPU restrictions at Howard Terminal2

5 in order to allow a massive re-development project with a ballpark, condominiums, hotels and

6 other development. Yet, the Commission mis-defined "the Project" before it and misconstrued the
7 Commission's role under CEQA, resulting in the Commission's reliance on a truncated and a

8 inadequate Final EA that failed to adequately disclose and consider all reasonably foreseeable

9 significant adverse environmental impacts of the HT Project taken as a whole, not only within the

10 Port and the City, but the Bay Area region at large. These actions were taken in violation of
11 CEQA, the State CEQA Guidelines (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15000, et seq.) ("CEQA Guidelines"),

12 and the Commission's certified regulatory program (14 Cal. Code Regs. §§ 11000 - 11008, 11500

13 -11561).

14 4. In approving BPA 2-19, the Commission also violated the McAteer-Petris Act and
15 the Commission's own regulations governing Bay Plan amendments by failing to conduct an

16 adequate assessment of the compatibility of BPA 2-19 with numerous Bay Plan and Seaport Plan

17 policies prioritizing protection and preservation of water-based industrial and port uses. Among

18 other things, the Commission abused its discretion in finding that AIG had demonstrated that

19 removal of the PPU designation from Howard Terminal would "not detract from the regional

20 capability to meet the projected growth in cargo," a necessary and critical finding required under
21 General Policy 4 of the Seaport Plan. In making this finding, the Commission overrode the

22 recommendation of the Seaport Planning Advisory Committee ("SPAC") in March 2022 that the

23 Commission should disapprove BPA 2-19 because AIG had failed to make the required showing

24 under Policy 4. Instead, the Commission proceeded to approve BPA 2-19 on the basis of "new
25 information" provided at the eleventh hour by AIG, which purported to show additional cargo

26
2
27 BPA 2-19 makes changes to certain Bay Plan maps and Seaport Plan figures and tables by removing the PPU designation from Howard Terminal, and makes certain changes to
28 Commission Resolution No. 16 establishing PPU boundaries within the Commission's jurisdiction at the Port of Oakland. See Resolution No. 2022-02, attached hereto as Exhibit A.
3 -
VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 capacity in the Bay Area region sufficient to meet future cargo growth demands without Howard

2 Terminal. This information was not brought before the SPAC for re-evaluation, as required by

3 Seaport Policy 4, and was also contradicted and undermined by BCDC's own analysis.

4 5. BCDC's removal of the protection of the PPU designation from Howard Terminal

5 undermined fundamental goals of the McAteer-Petris Act, the Bay Plan and the Seaport Plan

6 related to preservation of port priority areas for water-related industry. The Commission failed to

7 carry out its duties and abused its discretion in approving BPA 2-19 based on a legally

8 insufficient, and arbitrary and capricious, resolution of these issues.
9 6. Furthermore, the Commission's approval of BPA 2-19 should be set aside due to

10 the participation of the Commission Chair in the decision-making process. The public record

11 a shows that AIG was a client of the Commission Chair and his firm in connection with a similar

12 potential baseball stadium and mixed-use development project at the Oakland Coliseum, a matter

13 that is closely related to the HT Project. For over two years and several public hearings of the

14 Commission, the Chair was recused from participation with regard to BPA 2-19 due to conflict-

15 of-interest. However, once the SPAC recommended against BPA 2-19 in March 2022, the Chair
16 reversed course and led the Commission proceedings for approval of BPA 2-19, thereby violating

17 common-law conflict of interest principles and requiring that Resolution No. 2022-02 be set

18 aside.

19 7. Accordingly, this Petition and Complaint seeks a declaration that the approval of

20 BPA 2-19 and the Final EA was arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law, and of no legal force or

21 effect, and a writ of mandate commanding Respondent to set aside and vacate its actions.

22 THE PARTIES

23 8. Petitioner East Oakland Stadium Alliance ("EOSA") is comprised of a large and

24 diverse group of organizations and members with significant interests in ensuring the continued

25 success and vitality of maritime-related industrial uses, including transportation and union-related

26 interests, in and near the Port of Oakland. Many of the EOSA members, in connection with their

27 work and facilities at the Port, contribute significantly to the economy and institutions in the City
28 of Oakland and the region at large. The EOSA members include the majority of the transportation
- 4 -
VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 providers necessary to facilitate the movement of goods, and play a vital role in preserving the

2 local, regional and State-wide economic importance of the Port's industrial and transportation-

3 related operations. EOSA and its member organizations have a significant and direct interest in

4 preserving and expanding the maritime-related role of Howard Terminal at the Port that would be

5 eliminated by BPA 2-19 and the HT Project. EOSA seeks to protect these interests through

6 careful and balanced planning and permitting in the Port and the City, as well as protecting the

7 physical environment and historical uses in West Oakland from adverse development impacts.

8 Together with the broader West Oakland community, EOSA members seek to protect the
9 environmental and historical uses in West Oakland from the many significant and unavoidable

10 impacts that BPA 2-19 and the HT Project would cause. EOSA exhausted any administrative

11 remedies in this matter by presenting substantial comments to BCDC in opposition to BPA 2-19.

12 9. Petitioner Pacific Merchant Shipping Association ("PMSA") is a nonprofit mutual

13 benefit corporation trade association headquartered in the City of Oakland. Among other things,

14 the PMSA represents maritime interests on the U.S. West Coast and its members include ocean

15 carriers, marine terminal operators, and other maritime-related interests doing significant business
16 at and with California seaports, including the Port of Oakland. During BCDC's proceedings on

17 BPA 2-19, the PMSA submitted written and oral comments on the draft EA and accompanying

18 staff materials, individually and/or as a member of the EOSA, in opposition to BPA 2-19.

19 10. Petitioner Harbor Trucking Association ("HTA") is a trucking industry trade

20 association headquartered in Long Beach, California, focused on port and intermodal transport

21 and representing carriers doing business at West Coast ports. The HTA's members include

22 intermodal carriers and trucking service providers doing significant business at and with

23 California seaports, including the Port of Oakland. During the Commission's proceedings on

24 BPA 2-19, the HTA submitted written and oral comments, individually and/or as a member of the

25 EOSA, in opposition to BPA 2-19.

26 11. Petitioner California Trucking Association ("CTA") is headquartered in

27 Sacramento, California, and is the largest trucking association in California. The CTA includes
28 members doing significant business at and with California seaports, including the Port. During the
- 5 -
VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 Commission's proceedings on BPA 2-19, the CTA submitted written and oral comments,

2 individually and/or as a member of the EOSA, in opposition to BPA 2-19.

3 12. Petitioner Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. ("SSI'), headquartered in Portland,

4 Oregon, a is a scrap metal recycling company and a manufacturer of steel from recycled metal. For

5 over 50 years, SSI has owned and operated a scrap metals recycling facility and export terminal

6 on its private property at the Port of Oakland, located adjacent to the Howard Terminal, that

7 serves California, the western United States, and foreign markets. During the Commission's

8 proceedings on BPA 2-19, SSI submitted written and oral comments, individually and/or as a
9 member of the EOSA, in opposition to BPA 2-19.

10 13. Petitioner International Longshore and Warehouse Union ("ILWU") is a labor

11 organization with more than 29,000 members working in a variety of industries. Its members

12 include longshore workers and marine clerks at the twenty-nine ports on the West Coast of the

13 United States, including the Port of Oakland. During the Commission's proceedings on BPA 2-
14 19, the ILWU, through its members and local affiliates, submitted written and oral comments,

15 individually and/or as a member of the a EOSA, in opposition to BPA 2-19.
16 14. Respondent Commission is a California State government agency with a board of

17 27 Commissioners, and several advisory bodies. The Commission was created by the McAteer-

18 Petris Act to prevent "uncoordinated, haphazard filling of San Francisco Bay" and to ensure the

19 Bay and its shoreline are developed responsibly. Gov. Code § 66601. The Commission's §

20 jurisdiction includes San Francisco Bay, as well as a shoreline band of land extending inland for

21 100 feet. Id., § 66610. The HT Project proposed by AIG is located on lands partially within

22 BCDC's jurisdiction.

23 15. Real Party in Interest AIG is the applicant to BCDC for BPA 2-19, and is also the
24 applicant to the City for other approvals necessary for the proposed HT Project. Petitioners are

25 informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that AIG is a limited liability company with its
26 principal place of business in Oakland, doing business as the Oakland Athletics, a Major League

27 Baseball team.

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2 16. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under Code of Civil Procedure

3 (*CCP") § 1085 and CEQA §§ 21080.5(g) and 21168.5.

4 17. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to CCP § 393(b), in that the causes of

5 action alleged herein arose in Alameda County, where the PPU designation will be removed from

6 Howard Terminal as a result of Respondent's actions challenged herein.

7 18. Petitioners have performed all conditions precedent necessary to filing this action,

8 including exhaustion of administrative remedies to the extent required by law, and complying
9 with the notice provisions of CEQA §§ 21167.5 (Exhibit B hereto) and 21167.7 (Exhibit C

10 hereto).

11 19. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of CEQA § 21167.6 by

12 concurrently filing a request with Respondent for preparation of the record of proceedings

13 relating to this action.

14 20. Petitioners, and each of them, are parties beneficially interested in the proper

15 application of CEQA and the McAteer-Petris Act to the consideration of BPA 2-19 and the HT

16 Project. Among other things, BPA 2-19 and the HT Project will cause significant adverse
17 environmental impacts in the City, the Port, and the region, as well as business interference and
18 disruption that will adversely affect operations and services at the Port provided by Petitioners

19 and/or their members.

20 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

21 A. The HT Project, City of Oakland Environmental Review, and AIG's Application to
22 Initiate BPA 2-19.

23 21. On or about November 11, 2018, AIG applied to the City of Oakland for

24 environmental review and numerous governmental approvals for the HT Project. The Project is

25 proposed to be constructed in the Port on approximately 55 acres comprised of the Charles P.

26 Howard Terminal and adjacent parcels at the Port of Oakland. For over 100 years, Howard

27 Terminal has been devoted to serving the maritime and transportation industries associated with

28 incoming goods and materials to the United States and outgoing shipments of large volumes of

- 7-
VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 goods and materials for foreign markets. These activities at the Port, including the Howard

2 Terminal, reflect an intensive integration of land-based transportation systems, including railways

3 and roadways for heavy trucking, with large marine-based vessels berthing and lading/unloading

4 a on a constant basis.

5 22. The HT Project proposes significant disruption in this highly industrialized area. It

6 would displace all current activities at the Howard Terminal and other nearby properties in order

7 to a make way for a massive redevelopment project within the Port with significant environmental

8 impacts. Among other things, the HT Project would consist of a 35,000 seat baseball stadium; up
9 to 3,000 new residential units in up to 600-foot-tall high rise buildings (higher than any building

10 in Oakland today); up to 1.5 million square feet of office/commercial uses; a 3,500-seat indoor
11 performance venue; up to 280,000 square feet of hotel space; a network of approximately 18.3

12 acres of publicly-accessible open spaces; a maximum of approximately 8,900 total parking spaces

13 at full buildout; and a single vehicle grade separated overcrossing of the railroad tracks accessing
14 the Project site.

15 23. The development of the HT Project requires the granting of numerous approvals
16 by the City, serving as Lead Agency under CEQA for the Project, as well as numerous approvals
17 and permits from many other agencies serving as Responsible Agencies under CEQA. As alleged

18 herein, those project-related approvals include, and depend on, an action by the Commission to

19 remove the PPU designation from Howard Terminal to allow non-maritime development. As the

20 City has stated in materials submitted to BCDC, BPA 2-19 and the HT Project are "inextricably

21 linked," and "the A's express purpose in bringing forth BPA 2-19 is to 'allow the Oakland

22 Athletics to develop and operate on the Howard Terminal site a world-class waterfront ballpark
23 with related mixed-uses."3

24 24. On or about January 3, 2019, while the City of Oakland was conducting

25 environmental review for the HT Project in its capacity as Lead Agency, AIG applied to the

26

27 3 City of Oakland, "Supplemental Information on BCDC Environmental Justice and Social
28 Equity" (March 24, 2022), at 4, available at: https://www.portofoakland.com/wp- content/uploads/2022-04-07-Applicant-Supplemental-Info-re-BPA-2-19.pdf. 8
VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 Commission for an amendment to the Bay Plan and Seaport Plan to remove the PPU designation

2 from Howard Terminal for the HT Project. As alleged more fully below, following AIG's

3 application, the Commission held a series of meetings on BPA 2-19, but deferred any action until

4 the City completed its environmental impact report for the Project.

5 25. On February 17, 2022, the City certified an Environmental Impact Report for the

6 "Oakland Waterfront Ballpark District Project" (ER18-016, State Clearinghouse No.

7 2018112070) (the "EIR") and adopted findings and a Statement of Overriding Considerations.4

8 Throughout the City's environmental review process, the Commission was identified as and
9 participated as a Responsible Agency, including in submitting comments on the City's Draft EIR.
10 B. The Commission, Bay Plan and Seaport Plan.

11 26. The McAteer-Petris Act declares that "certain water-oriented land uses along the

12 bay shoreline are essential to the public welfare of the bay area," and that these uses include

13 ports and "water-related industries." Gov. Code § 66602 (emphasis added). The Act requires

14 that the "San Francisco Bay Plan should make provision for adequate and suitable locations for

15 all these uses, thereby minimizing the necessity for future bay fill to create new sites for these

16 uses. Id.

17 27. Pursuant to the McAteer-Petris Act, the Commission adopted the San Francisco
18 Bay Plan (*Bay Plan") and the San Francisco Bay Area Seaport Plan ("Seaport Plan"), 5 and is
19 charged with implementing the policies in those plans. The Bay Plan and Seaport Plan include

20 numerous policies to ensure the protection and preservation of water-based industrial uses,

21 consistent with the findings in the McAteer-Petris Act. For example, the Bay Plan recognizes that

22 "[t]he navigable, deep water sites around the Bay are a unique and limited resource and should
23 be protected for uses requiring deep draft ship terminals, such as water-related industries and

24 ports." See Bay Plan, Water Related Industry, Finding (b.) (emphasis added). The Bay Plan also

25 4 The City's EIR is under legal challenge in several related actions pending in Alameda County
26 Superior Court, see Capitol Corridor Joint Powers Authority v. City of Oakland (Case No.

27 22CV009309); East Oakland Stadium Alliance v. City of Oakland (Case No. 22CV009325); Union Pacific Railroad Company v. City of Oakland (Case No. 22CV009330).
28 The Seaport Plan is an extension of the Bay Plan that contains more specific findings and policies governing port planning and development.
- 9 -
VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 provides that "[s]ites designated for both water-related industry and port uses in the Bay Plan

2 should be reserved for those industries and port uses that require navigable, deep water for

3 receiving materials or shipping products by water in order to gain a significant transportation cost

4 advantage…" Bay Plan Water Related Industry, Policy 1 (emphasis added). Bay Plan Water-

5 Related Industry Policy 3 provides that "other uses" may be allowed on land reserved for water-

6 related industry and port use if such uses "would not preempt future use of the site for water-

7 related industry or port use."

8 28. Consistent with these policies and findings, the Seaport Plan designates certain
9 areas determined to be necessary for future port development as "port priority use areas." These

10 areas are "reserved for port-related and other uses that will not impede development of the sites

11 for port purposes." Seaport Plan at 1 (see: https://bcdc.ca.gov/seaport/seaport.pdf.). Port priority
12 use areas include "marine terminals and directly related ancillary activities, ship repair,

13 supporting ground transportation facilities, and directly related marine service facilities." Seaport
14 Plan at 8. Furthermore:

15 "Port priority use areas should be protected for marine terminals and directly-

16 related ancillary activities such as container freight stations, transit sheds and other temporary storage, ship repairing, support transportation uses including
17 trucking and railroad yards, freight forwarders, government offices related to the
port activity, chandlers, and marine services. Other uses, especially public access
18 and public and commercial recreational development, should also be permissible
uses provided they do not significantly impair the efficient utilization of the port
19 area." Bay Area Plan, Port Policy No. 3 (emphasis added).

20 29. Importantly, General Policy No. 4 of the Seaport Plan provides that removal of a

21 PPU designation should not occur absent sufficient justification:

22 "Deletions of the port priority use and marine terminal designations from this plan
should not occur unless the person or organization requesting the deletion can
23 demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Seaport Planning Advisory Committee that

24 the deletion does not detract from the regional capability to meet the projected growth in cargo. Requests for deletions of port priority or marine terminal
25 designations should include a justification for the proposed deletion and should demonstrate that the cargo forecast can be met with existing terminals." (Emphasis
26 added.)

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

30. The entire Port of Oakland, including the Howard Terminal site, is designated as a

2 PPU area. Future development proposed in PPUs within the Commission's jurisdiction must be

3 consistent with policies in the Bay Plan and Seaport Plan related to those areas.

4 C. Bay Plan and Seaport Plan Amendment Process.

6 are "consistent with the findings and declarations of policy" in the McAteer-Petris Act. Gov.

7 Code § 66652. Such amendments must be made by resolution of the Commission adopted after

8 public hearing. If the proposed change pertains to a policy a or standard contained in the Bay Plan,

10 Commission members. Id.

11 32. The Commission's regulations specify further procedures for Bay Plan
12 amendments. See 14 Cal. Code Regs. §§ 11000-11008. Among other things, the Commission

13 must prepare a "descriptive notice" (id. § 11001, 11002) and staff planning report containing,
14 among other things, an environmental assessment which "shall either (i) state that the proposed

15 amendment will have no significant adverse environmental impacts or (ii) shall describe any

16 possible significant adverse effects that the proposed amendment would have on the environment

17 and shall describe any public benefits of the proposed amendment, any feasible mitigation

18 measures that would lessen the significant adverse environmental impact(s) and shall evaluate

19 any feasible alternatives to the change." Id. § 11003 (emphasis added).

20 33. After the final public hearing on the proposed amendment, Commission staff must
21 prepare a final staff planning recommendation that must contain, among other things, any

22 necessary revisions to the environmental assessment and a final recommendation for Commission
23 action. Id. § 11005. If the Commission passes a resolution of approval of the Bay Plan

24 amendment, the Executive Director must file a notice of the adoption of the proposed plan

3 D. BCDC's Initiation of BPA 2-19, Initial Public Meetings, and Recusals.

4 34. On January 17, 2019, shortly after AIG submitted its application to the

5 Commission to remove the PPU designation from Howard Terminal, the Commission held a

6 public hearing to consider issuing a "Brief Descriptive Notice" to initiate the BPA 2-19 process.

7 The Commission Chair was recused from consideration of this matter due to his representation of

8 AIG in connection with the redevelopment of the Oakland Coliseum. 6 The Commission voted
9 15-4 to issue the Descriptive Notice for BPA 2-19, and set an initial public hearing date for

10 December 5, 2019.7 On April 5, 2019, the Commission mailed the Descriptive Notice for BPA 2-
11 19 to agencies, organizations and other interested parties. The Commission thereafter mailed

12 notices of revised dates for the public hearing for June 18, 2020, March 18, 2021, October 21,

13 2021, February 17, 2022, May 5, 2022 and June 2, 2022.

14 35. On June 6, 2019, BCDC met to consider and take positions on legislation,

15 including AB 1191 (Bonta), the "Oakland Waterfront Sports and Mixed-Use Project, Waterfront

16 Access, Environmental Justice, and Revitalization Act." AB 1191 was signed by the Governor on

17 October 11, 2019, and allows the State Lands Commission and BCDC to take certain actions

18 related to the potential re-development of the Howard Terminal property for the HT Project.

19 Section 8(a) of AB 1191 provides:
20 "BCDC shall determine by February 28, 2020, or 140 days after the certification by the
21 City of a project-level environmental impact report for the Oakland Sports and Mixed-
Use Project, whichever is later, whether the Howard Terminal property and adjacent areas
22 designated for port priority use, or portions of them, are no longer required for port

23 priority use and shall be deemed free of the port priority use area designation for purposes of the Oakland Sports and Mixed-Use Project, or whether these areas are needed for port
24 priority use and should continue in port priority use designation." (Emphasis added.)

25

26 6 The Chair stated: "I am going to recuse myself on the next two items because my firm represents the Oakland A's, not on the Howard Terminal but on the Coliseum." See:

27 , https://bcdc.ca.gov/minutes/2019/0117Minutes.html At the same hearing, the Commission voted a to initiate a general update to the Seaport Plan
28 (BPA 1-19), which update remains pending. See: https://bcdc.ca.gov/BPA/BPASeaportPlan.html.

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

36. Additionally, Section 8(b) of AB 1191 specifies that if the Commission approves

2 BPA 2-19, and the Port and AIG have not entered into a binding agreement by January 1, 2025,

3 that allows for the construction of the Project, the PPU designation "shall be automatically

4 reinstated on the Howard Terminal property as if it had not been deleted' (emphasis added). In

5 other words, BPA 2-19 was adopted for the sole purpose of allowing the HT Project.

6 37. The Commission Chair recused himself from the discussion of AB 1191, stating:

7 "The next item is Item 10 and am recusing myself on that item because my firm does represent

8 the A's."8

9 38. A Commission advisory body, the Design Review Board, conducted two public
10 meetings on October 7, 2020 and April 5, 2021 to review the design aspects of the HT Project

11 such as transportation, public access, recreation, and open space.

12 39. On February 3, 2022, the Commission received a briefing from Commission staff
13 on the status of BPA 2-19. As with past hearings, the Commission Chair recused himself from

14 consideration regarding BPA 2-19, stating: "T want to inform the Commission that will be

15 recusing myself from the Howard Terminal discussion and that Commissioner Randolph will take

16 over in my place."9
17 E. The 2050 Cargo Forecast and March 2022 SPAC Recommendation.

18 40. Both the Bay Plan and Seaport Plan require BCDC to provide an up-to-date cargo

19 forecast to guide the Commission's planning and policy development. Beginning in 2019, BCDC
20 staff initiated the process of developing a new cargo forecast to inform the consideration of BPA

21 1-19 and 2-19 (*2050 Cargo Forecast").10 The 2050 Cargo Forecast provides forecasts to 2050
22 for the three major types of cargo moving through Bay Area seaports containerized cargo, roll

23 on/roll-off ("ro-ro") cargo, and dry bulk cargoand provides a high-level review of marine

24 terminal capacity and expansion potential to meet future needs.

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

41. The 2050 Cargo Forecast was developed under the guidance of the SPAC over the

2 course of three public meetings and following a rigorous peer-review process. The SPAC

3 approved the final Forecast in May 2020. The Forecast concluded that the Bay Area region lacks

4 sufficient capacity to accommodate all three major cargo types through 2050 under the "Moderate

5 Growth" scenario (identified as the "baseline" or "most likely" scenario) without Howard

6 Terminal. Specifically, the Cargo Forecast found that under the Moderate Growth scenario, the

7 Bay Area would need to activate 308 additional acres of capacity to handle the expected increase

8 in cargo, and that removing Howard Terminal from port priority use would result in an
9 approximately 25-acre deficit. That deficiency would be significantly worse (a shortfall of more

10 than 200 acres) under the "Strong Growth" scenario.

11 42. On March 16, 2022, the SPAC held a meeting to consider BPA 2-19 and provide a

12 recommendation to the Commission. After public comment, the SPAC voted 5-4 (with one

13 abstention) to recommend that the Commission deny BPA 2-19. The SPAC found that AIG had

14 not met its burden under Seaport Plan General Policy 4 to show that the deletion of the PPU

15 designation for the Howard Terminal site would not detract from regional capability to meet
16 projected cargo growth in the Bay Area:

17 The SPAC opposes the approval of the Bay Plan Amendment to remove the Port

18 PUA designation for Howard Terminal because the Oakland Athletic have not
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the SPAC that the deletion of the Port
19 Priority Use Area designation for Howard Terminal would not detract from the
regional capability to meet the projected growth in cargo, the request does not
20 include an adequate justification for the proposed deletion and does not demonstrate that the cargo forecast can be met with existing terminals. (Emphasis
21 added.)'1

22 F. BCDC Preliminary Staff Recommendation and Initial Environmental Assessment.

23 43. Shortly after the March 16, 2022 SPAC meeting, AIG, the Port and the City met

24 with BCDC staff and provided a large volume of "new information" in support of BPA 2-19,

25 including information relating to purported additional capacity for seaport operations at the Port

1 of Benicia. This late-submitted information had not been made available to the public, the SPAC

2 or the Commission prior to the March 16 SPAC meeting.

3 44. On May 2, 2022, the Commission issued a Staff Report/Preliminary Staff

4 Recommendation and an initial Environmental Assessment ("EA") for BPA 2-19. Based on the

5 purported "additional information" provided by AIG and the Port after the SPAC meeting, staff

6 now identified an additional 47 acres of ro-ro capacity available at the Port of Benicia than was

7 originally assumed under the 2050 Cargo Forecast, and found that Bay Area seaports would only

8 need to activate 261 acres of capacity across all cargo typesor 47 acres less than the 308 acres
9 originally assumed under the Forecast. Staff Report, at 7. Based on this "new information," staff

10 found that under a "Moderate Growth" scenario, there would be a 22-acre surplus for all cargo
11 types in 2050 without Howard Terminal. Id. The Staff Report concluded that AIG had

12 demonstrated that the region would be able to meet the projected growth in cargo for all cargo

13 types under a "Moderate Growth" scenario without Howard Terminal-but cautioned that "this

14 would leave little room for regional growth beyond 2050." ld.12
15 45. Despite the SPAC's required role under Seaport Plan General Policy 4, the
16 Commission did not direct that this "new information" be brought back before the SPAC for
17 consideration, although there was adequate time and opportunity to do so.
18 46. The initial EA proposed by BCDC staff was deficient in numerous respects. It

19 concluded, inexplicably, that approving BPA 2-19 would not result in any direct or reasonably
20 foresecable indirect significant adverse environmental impacts. While acknowledging that BPA

21 2-19 was "project-driven" Bay Plan amendment, the EA mistakenly concluded that the HT

22 Project is a "distinct and independent" project from BPA 2-19, and that the physical changes

23 resulting from the HT Project were merely "speculative" and did not constitute "reasonably

24 foreseeable" indirect impacts of BPA 2-19 because no permit application had yet been submitted

25 to BCDC for the HT Project. EA, at. 7. The EA went on to provide an abbreviated and

26
12
27 BCDC staff also found that under a "Moderate Growth" scenario, the Bay Area region will be

28 at 98-100 percent capacity for container cargo, "with site or rorroomuiog adiztional grewethmin beyond 2050,' and that if the Bay Area experiences "strong growth" through be major capacity shortage across cargo types." Staff Report, at 94-95.

2 they were an "indirect" effect of BPA 2-19, but "at a high level and for informational purposes"

3 only. Id. at 31 (emphasis added). The EA asserted that the Commission was serving as the

4 CEQA "Lead Agency" for purposes of BPA 2-19, but would act as a "Responsible Agency" only

5 in approving any future permit applications for the HT Project. Id. at 5. In sum, the EA failed to

6 accurately and properly advise the Commission and the public of the Commission's role and

7 duties as a Responsible Agency under CEQA to fully consider all impacts of the HT Project that

8 could reasonably flow from a decision by the Commission granting a critical approval that opens
9 the gate for replacement of the protected port-priority uses at Howard Terminal with the private

10 mixed-use development project proposed by the AIG, or to make CEQA-required findings in

11 relation thereto.

12 G. The June 2, 2022 Commission Hearing.

13 47. On June 2, 2022, the Commission held a public hearing to consider a vote on BPA

14 2-19. At or before the hearing, Petitioners and other commenters submitted numerous oral and

15 written comments to the Commission identifying serious deficiencies in staff's initial EA and
16 Preliminary Staff Recommendation, including that the EA improperly segmented BPA 2-19 from

17 the overall HT Project and its impacts, failed to adequately analyze significant environmental

18 impacts of the HT Project as a reasonably foreseeable indirect effect of BPA 2-19, failed to
19 analyze any environmental impacts resulting from the shift in truck and vessel traffic from

20 Howard Terminal to the Port of Benicia and other Bay Area ports, and failed to analyze impacts
21 associated with increased Bay fill as a result of BPA 2-19 and the HT Project.

22 48. In addition to these and other CEQA deficiencies, Petitioners raised other

23 concerns, including that AIG had failed to make the required showing for removal of the PPU

24 designation from Howard Terminal, that BCDC's Staff Report contradicted the findings of the

25 SPAC based on information submitted belatedly by AIG and the Port, that BCDC failed to
26 provide the "new information" to the SPAC for consideration as required by Seaport Plan General

27 Policy 4, that the Commission failed to conduct an analysis of the consistency of BPA 19-2 with
28 critical Bay Plan and Seaport Plan policies for protection of water-based industry, and that the

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 Commission Chair's participation in the BPA 2-19 decision-making process raised conflict-of-

2 interest and appearance of impropriety issues requiring recusal from those proceedings.

3 49. After hearing public comment, the Chair closed the public hearing, but extended

4 the deadline for written public comments to June 3, 2022.

5 H. BCDC Final Staff Recommendation and Revised Environmental Assessment.

6 50. On June 17, 2022, BCDC staff issued a Final Staff Recommendation, Responses

7 to Comments and Revised Environmental Assessment ("Revised EA") for BPA 2-19. Staff

8 concluded that based on the revised ro-ro capacity at the Port of Benicia (discussed in Section F.,
9 above), AIG had demonstrated that removing the PPU designation from Howard Terminal would

10 not detract from the regional capability to meet the projected growth in cargo under the

11 "Moderate Growth" scenario. See Final Staff Recommendation at 7, 25.

12 51. The Revised EA did not correct the errors of the initial EA. The Revised EA

13 concluded that BPA 2-19 would not result in any direct or indirect effects on the environment,

14 and that the HT Project does not constitute a reasonably foreseeable indirect effect of BPA 2-19

15 and was instead "wholly speculative." In response to public comment, the Revised EA did
16 purport to include some "additional analysis" of the environmental impacts of the HT Project and

17 potential mitigation measures to lessen those impacts, "assuming" BPA 2-19 to be a reasonably

18 foreseeable indirect effect of BPA 2-19. However, this "additional analysis" merely relied on

19 selected summaries of some analysis in the City's EIR for the HT Project. The Commission also
20 identified "[n]o feasible mitigation measures or project alternatives. to lessen the potentially

21 significant adverse environmental impacts of the Ballpark Project that can be adopted and

22 implemented by the Commission as part of its action on BPA No. 2-19." Revised EA, at 44.
23 I. BCDC's Adoption of Resolution No. 2022-02 and Approval of BPA 2-19.

24 52. On June 30, 2022, the Commission held a public meeting to vote on BPA 2-19.

25 Both prior to and during the meeting, numerous commenters, including members of the EOSA,

26 commented that the Revised EA was inadequate in numerous respects, and noted other

27 deficiencies with BCDC's process for adopting BPA 2-19. On June 29, 2022, Petitioners

28 submitted additional written comments to the Commission, noting that the Final Staff

4 Commission, including the Chair, voted to adopt Resolution No. 2022-02 approving BPA 2-19

5 and the Revised EA (i.e., the "Final EA"). 13

6 53. On July 1, 2022, BCDC filed a Notice of Decision for BPA 2-19 with the Natural

7 Resources Agency, as required by BCDC's certified regulatory program (14 Cal. Code Regs. con

14 55. Petitioners incorporate by reference the allegations of paragraphs 1-54 above.
15 56. CEQA was enacted to inform the public and government agencies about a

16 proposed project's potential environmental impacts and to disclose to the public the rationale for

18 CEQA is "the whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in either a direct physical

19 change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the

20 environment." CEQA Guidelines § 15378(a) (emphasis added). The term "project" refers to the

21 underlying real-world "activity which is being approved and which may be subject to several

22 approvals by governmental agencies," and does not mean "each separate governmental
23 approval." Id., § 15378(c) (emphasis added). "CEQA forbids 'piecemeal' review of the

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 57. Under CEQA, 3CDC was required to consider the consequences of the entire HT

2 Project- and not just a Bay Plan amendment as if standing alone and apart from the HT Project-

3 and to make the determinations and findings in that regard as required of a Responsible Agency

4 under CEQA (CEQA § 21081; CEQA Guidelines § 15091), both of which the Commission failed

5 to do.

6 58. In taking the actions challenged herein, the Commission failed to carry out these

7 duties and prejudicially abused its discretion by violating CEQA in numerous respects, including

8 but not limited to the following:
9 (i) The Final EA mistakenly treats BPA 2-19 as a "separate and independent"
10 project for CEQA purposes and thus improperly "segments" environmental
11 review of BPA 2-19 from review of the HT Project, failing to adequately

12 study and advise the Commission of the significant direct and indirect
13 environmental impacts of the HT Project as a whole, including impacts to
14 biological resources, water quality, and air quality, among others.

15 (ii) The Final EA improperly identifies BCDC as the "Lead Agency" despite
16 the fact that the City of Oakland is the "Lead Agency" for the HT Project,
17 and the Commission's proper role under CEQA is as a Responsible
18 Agency with duties to consider the EIR and all project-related impacts and

19 feasible mitigation measures and alternatives within its jurisdiction, and
20 make necessary findings required by CEQA related thereto. See Save San
21 Francisco Bay Ass 'n. v. San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development
22 Comm. (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 908, 921-922.
23 (iii) Even if the Final EA's analysis could be separated from the HT Project, the

24 Final EA, even taken on its own, fails to adequately evaluate and disclose
25 all reasonably foreseeable direct and indirect environmental impacts of

26 BPA 2-19, including but not limited to effects associated with (i) the

27 reasonably foreseeable shift in vessel and truck traffic from Howard

28 Terminal to the Port of Benicia and/or other Bay Area ports (including
- 19 -
VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

2 impacts to air quality, navigational safety, biological resources,

3 transportation and others); (ii) the potential relocation of existing ancillary

g u p uses at Howard Terminal, including heavy truck parking, to other locations
in the Seaport, including potential air quality and transportation impacts;
and (iii) conflicts with BCDC policies and regulations governing PPU

7 designated areas, including transportation and other impacts associated

8 with transportation congestion and a decrease in available dock operations.

(iv) The Final EA fails to adequately analyze reasonably foreseeable

10 environmental impacts resulting from future increased Bay fill associated

11 with BPA 2-19 and the HT Project, including adverse impacts to fish and

12 wildlife habitat, increased risk of water pollution, and increased air
pollution, among others.

13 (v)

14 Rather than conduct an adequate evaluation of these and other impacts, the

15 Final EA improperly defers the Commission's full environmental review of

16 BPA 2-19 and the HT Project to a future time when the Commission

17 considers a permit application for the HT Project, and relies only on

18 summaries and portions of the EIR certified by the City of Oakland.

(vi)

19 The Final EA also fails to undertake any analysis of potential cumulative

20 impacts of the Turning Basin Widening Project together with BPA 2-19
and the HT Project.
21 (vii)

22 In approving Resolution No. 2022-02, BCDC failed to adopt adequate

23 findings as required by CEQA § 21081, CEQA Guidelines §§ 15091(a) and

24 15093(b), and 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 11524(c)-(d).

25 (viii) In addition, the Commission failed in its duties under CEQA to provide

26 adequate responses to public comments, including comments made by

27 EOSA and other Petitioners raising significant environmental issues.

3 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

4 (Writ of Mandate - Violation of the McAteer-Petris Act and Bay Plan Policies)

5 60. Petitioners incorporate by reference the allegations of paragraphs 1-59 above.

6 61. An agency abuses its discretion if it "did not apply or properly interpret the
7 governing law or consider all relevant factors, or if there was no rational connection between the

8 relevant factors, the choice made, and the purposes of the enabling statute or regulation."
9 Manderson-Saleh v. Regents of University of California (2021) 60 Cal.App.5th 674, 693 (citation

10 omitted).

11 62. The McAteer-Petris Act requires that amendments to the Bay Plan "shall be

12 consistent with the findings and declarations of policy" therein. Gov. Code § 66652. As §
13 described herein, the Bay Plan and the Seaport Plan provide numerous policies prioritizing

14 protection and preservation of water-related industry and port uses, including ancillary port uses.

15 See, e.g., Gov. Code § 66602; Bay Plan, Water Related Industry, Finding (b.); Water Related
16 Industry, Policy 1; Port Policy No. 3; Seaport Plan, at 1. The Commission's regulations also

17 require BCDC, before approving a Bay Plan amendment, to assess "the effect the proposed
18 change would have on any existing finding, policy or map designation" in the Bay Plan or

19 Seaport Plan, as well as "the consistency of the proposed change with the findings and

20 declarations of policy in the [McAteer-Petris Act]." 14 Cal. Code Regs § 11003(b)(3)-(4).

21 63. Additionally, Seaport Plan General Policy 4 provides that deletions of the PPU

22 designation "should not occur" unless the applicant "can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the

23 [SPAC] that the deletion does not detract from the regional capability to meet the projected

24 growth in cargo," and such requests must "include a justification for the proposed deletion and

25 should demonstrate that the cargo forecast can be met with existing terminals."

26 64. In approving BPA 2-19, Respondent acted arbitrarily and capriciously, and abused

27 its discretion in numerous respects, including but not limited to (i) relying on incomplete and
28 inaccurate information, including inaccurate cargo capacity analyses and other information
. 21 -

3 and the HT Project with critical policies and findings in the McAteer-Petris Act, Bay Plan and

4 Seaport Plan regarding port priority use areas; and (iii) failing to provide for the SPAC to

5 evaluate the "new information" submitted belatedly by AIG and the Port following the March

6 2022 SPAC meeting, contrary to the intent of Seaport Plan General Policy 4.

7 65. In taking these and other actions as alleged herein, Respondent acted arbitrarily

8 and capriciously, and committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion.
9 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

10 (Common Law Conflict of Interest/Bias)

11 66. Petitioners incorporate by reference the allegations of paragraphs 1-65 above.

12 67. "A public officer is impliedly bound to exercise the powers conferred on him with

13 disinterested skill, zeal, and diligence and primarily for the benefit of the public." Clark v. City of

14 Hermosa Beach (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1152, 1170-71 (internal citation omitted). Accordingly,

15 public decisionmakers must be "neutral and unbiased," and "allowing a biased decision maker to

16 participate in [a] decision is enough to invalidate the decision." Woody's Group, Inc. V. City of

17 Newport Beach (2015) 233 Cal.App.4th 1012, 1022.

18 68. The Commission Chair participated in the hearings and vote on BPA 2-19, and
19 signed Resolution No. 2022-02 approving BPA 2-19. At the same time, the public record shows

20 that the Commission Chair is an attorney and partner in an Oakland law firm15 that served AIG as
21 a client for many years with all attendant ethical duties of confidentiality and loyalty to AIG. 16

22 69. The redevelopment of the Coliseum, where the A's have a one-half interest, and

23 the HT Project are interrelated. For example, AIG has stated that the development of the

24 15 See Fair Political Practices Commission ("FPCC"), letter to Michael Ng (May 9, 2022), File
25 No. A-22-035, available at: https://www.fppc.ca.gov/content/dam/fppc/documents/advice- letters/2022/22035.pdf. While the FPCC concluded there was not a financial conflict of interest
26 under the Political Reform Act, the letter did not address common law conflict of interest.
16 For example, an attorney bio on the firm's website states that the Commission Chair "is
27 currently representing the Oakland A's in negotiations with the City of Oakland and County of

28 Alameda acquisition of the Coliseum for a large mixed use development." See:
https://www.wendel.com/attorney/wasserman-rzachary/.

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 Coliseum site is essential to financing the HT Project. 17 The Coliseum site is also Alternative 2

2 to the HT site in the City's EIR for the HT Project, and if selected instead of the HT site, would

3 lessen or avoid many of the significant impacts of the HT Project.

4 70. Because the Commission Chair and his firm recently represented AIG in the

5 Coliseum and possibly other matters, there are ethical and legal duties to AIG as a client and/or

6 former client that preclude disclosure of information that could be pertinent to the decision before

7 the Commission, but are not available to the public, and that could cause bias or the appearance of

8 basis in favor of AIG.

9 71. As alleged herein, prior to the June 2, 2022 hearing, the Commission Chair had

10 been recused from all proceedings or actions regarding BPA No. 2-19 a over a three-year period,

11 including the initial consideration of BPA No. 2-19 in 2019 (which required an official vote by

12 the Commission for initiation), up to and including the February 3, 2022 Commission meeting

13 regarding the status of BPA 2-19. However, following the SPAC recommendation against BPA

14 2-19, the Chair changed direction and served not only as a member of the Commission, but led

15 the Commission in the role of Chair in its determination to approve AIG's application for BPA 2-

16 19. These facts and events and raise an "unacceptable probability of actual bias" (BreakZone

17 Billiards v. City of Torrance (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1236), requiring Resolution No. 2022-

18 02 and BPA 2-19 to be set aside.

19 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

20 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for relief as follows:
21 1. a For a declaration and judgment that Respondent committed a prejudicial abuse of

22 discretion in failing to comply with CEQA, the McAteer-Petris Act, and common law conflict-of-
23 interest principles, as alleged herein;

Resolution No. 2022-02

Adoption of Bay Plan Amendment 2-19
Removing the Port Priority Use Area Designation
from Howard Terminal in the City of Oakland

Whereas, in 1965, the McAteer-Petris Act established the San Francisco Bay Conservation and
Development Commission ("BCDC" or "the Commission") as a temporary State agency,
designated the San Francisco Bay as a State-protected resource, and charged the Commission
with preparing a plan for the long-term of the Bay and regulating development in and around
the Bay while the plan was being prepared;
Whereas, the initial San Francisco Bay Plan (Bay Plan) was approved in 1968, BCDC was made
permanent one year later, and BCDC updates the Bay Plan regularly to ensure that the Bay and
its shoreline are developed and conserved responsibly and to address new issues as the Bay
Area changes;
Whereas, the Commission, in collaboration with the five Bay Area ports, adopted the Seaport
Plan in 1982 as a more specific application of the San Francisco Bay Plan, to minimize the risk of
uncoordinated, haphazard Bay fill and to encourage the ports to coordinate their planning and
development;
Whereas, Government Code Section 66652 states that "the Commission at any time may
amend, or repeal and adopt a new form of, all or any part of the San Francisco Bay Plan but
such changes shall be consistent with the findings and declaration of policy" contained in the
McAteer-Petris Act;
Whereas, the Legislature directed the Commission to keep the Bay Plan up to date so that it
reflects the latest scientific research on the Bay and addresses emerging issues that could
impact the Bay in the future. To accomplish this, the Legislature empowered the Commission to amend the Bay Plan a if it pertains to a policy or standard contained in the Bay Plan or defines a
water oriented use referred in Government Code Sections 66602 or 66605 upon two-thirds (18)
of the 27 members of the Commission voting for the amendment, after providing an
opportunity for public review of the proposed amendment and after holding a public hearing on the amendment. Over its history, the Commission has made numerous amendments to the Bay Plan, ranging from changing a boundary of a Bay Plan map designation to addressing policy
issues, such as climate change and environmental justice;
Whereas, the Commission received and filed an application from the Oakland Athletics
(Applicant) to modify the Bay Plan Maps 4 and 5 as well as Table 5, Table 10, Table 11, and
Figure 4 of the Seaport Plan by removing the Port Priority Use Area designation from 56 acres
of Port Priority Use Area at Howard Terminal at the Port of Oakland;

Resolution No. 2022-02 Bay Plan Amendment No. 2-19 Removing Howard Terminal from Port Priority Use Page 2
June 17, 2022

Whereas, the Commission: (1) on January 17, 2019, approved a Descriptive Notice on the
proposed Bay Plan Amendment and set a public hearing date for December 5, 2019; (2) on April
5, 2019, mailed the Descriptive Notice to all agencies, organizations and individuals interested
in the proposed amendment; (3) On November 22, 2019, mailed a Notice of Revised Date of
Public Hearing and set a new public hearing date for June 18, 2020, and subsequently mailed
additional notices of Revised Date of Public Hearings for March 18, 2021, October 21, 2021,
February 17, 2022, May 5, 2022, and June 2, 2022; (4) on May 2, 2022, mailed by first class
postal service the Staff Report, Preliminary Recommendation and Environmental Assessment to all agencies, organizations and individuals interested in the proposed amendment; (5) on June
2, 2022, held a public hearing to receive public comments on the proposed amendment,
preliminary recommendation and environmental assessment; (6) on June 17, 2022, mailed the final staff recommendation and revised environmental assessment to all agencies,
organizations, and individuals who received the staff planning report and who are known to be
interested in the proposed amendment; (7) on June 30, 2022, voted on the staff's final
recommendation, all in accord with the requirements and procedures set out in Government
Code Section 66652 and the California Code of Regulations, Sections 11000, 11001, 11002,
11103, 11004, 11005, and 11006;
Whereas, the Commission has considered all oral comments presented at the June 2, 2022,
public hearing, as well as all written comments received, and staff has responded to those
comments;
Whereas, the Oakland Athletics, as Applicant for BPA 2-19, have demonstrated that the
removal of Howard Terminal from Port Priority Use Area designation does not detract from the
regional capability to meet the projected growth in cargo; and that the Applicant included a
justification for the proposed deletion and demonstrated that the Cargo Forecast can be met
with existing terminals;
Whereas, the Commission has prepared a Revised Environmental Assessment, incorporating
the errata corrections presented by staff on slide 23 of staff's presentation at the June 30, 2022
meeting, for the proposed Bay Plan amendment in accordance with the Commission's
regulations implementing CEQA. The Revised Environmental Assessment concludes that BPA No. 2-19, as a change to a planning-level designation, would not result in any direct or indirect
significant adverse environmental impacts.
Whereas, assuming the a Ballpark Project to be a reasonably foreseeable indirect effect or
consequence of BPA No. 2-19 which, as identified in the Revised EA and which incorporates by
reference the City's certified EIR, would result in significant and unavoidable impacts with
respect to wind, construction emissions, operation emissions, cumulative air quality, historic
resources, cumulative historic resources, construction noise, vibration, cumulative noise, at-
grade crossings, and degradation of MTS or CMP roadway segments.
Whereas, it is not feasible for the Commission to impose development-level mitigation for a
project that is not before it as a condition of its action on a BPA to remove a PUA designation and that responsibility for mitigating significant impacts of the Ballpark Project will in some
instances be the responsibility of other agencies when issuing their entitlements for the
Ballpark Project.

Resolution No. 2022-02 Bay Plan Amendment No. 2-19 Removing Howard Terminal from Port Priority Use Page ?
June 17, 2022

Whereas, the Commission is acting as CEQA lead agency for purposes of BPA No. 2-19, the
purpose of which is different than the Ballpark Project, and the Commission will act as CEQA
responsible agency for purposes of the Ballpark Project if and when a major permit application
is submitted for that Project, at which time the Commission will be able to meaningfully
evaluate the environmental impacts of the Ballpark Project and require mitigation measures to
lessen those impacts consistent with and pursuant to the Commission's laws and policies.
Now, Therefore, Be It Resolved That, the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development
Commission hereby adopts the following Bay Plan Amendment:
Bay Plan Amendment No. 2-19, a request by the Oakland Athletics to amend the San
Francisco Bay Plan (Bay Plan) and Seaport Plan to remove the Port Priority Use Area (PUA)
designation at Howard Terminal at the Port of Oakland.
Be it further resolved that, the above Bay Plan Amendment makes changes to the San
Francisco Bay Plan Map 4 and Map 5 as well as Table 5, Table 10, Table 11, and Figure 4 of the Seaport Plan, by removing the Port Priority Use Area designation from 56 acres of Port Priority
Use Area at Howard Terminal at the Port of Oakland, as described in Exhibit A.
Be it further resolved that, the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission
hereby adopts Bay Plan Amendment No. 2-19 which amends Resolution 16 with the underlined
language added and the language struck through as deleted, as follows:
52. Oakland (Port) (Amended by Bay Plan Amendment Nos. 5-82 and 4-00 and 2-19)
(A) West Boundary: A line parallel to Wake Avenue from its intersection with Grand Avenue
extended east to Wood Avenue.

(B) East Boundary: Clay Street, Oakland, extended-te shereline. East line of parcel number 18-
395-1.
Be it further resolved that, the above Bay Plan Amendment conforms to all relevant policies of
Government Code sections 66000 through 66661 as more fully discussed in the Preliminary
Staff Planning Report and the Final Staff Planning Recommendation, which are hereby
incorporated by reference.
Be it further resolved that, the Commission finds that, based on the Revised Environmental
Assessment which is hereby incorporated by reference, there will be no substantial adverse
impacts on the environment directly or indirectly created by or resulting from amending the
San Francisco Bay Plan by modifying Map 4 and Map 5 as well as Table 5, Table 10, Table 11, and Figure 4 of the Seaport Plan, by removing the Port Priority Use Area designation from
Howard Terminal as requested by the Applicant.
Be it further resolved that, assuming the Ballpark Project to be a reasonably foreseeable
indirect effect or consequence of BPA No. 2-19, that the Ballpark Project would result in
significant and unavoidable impacts with respect to wind, construction emissions, operation
emissions, cumulative air quality, historic resources, cumulative historic resources, construction
noise, vibration, cumulative noise, at-grade crossings, and degradation of MTS or CMP roadway
segments.

Resolution No. 2022-02 Bay Plan Amendment No. 2-19 Page 4
Removing Howard Terminal from Port Priority Use June 17, 2022

Be it further resolved that, it is not feasible for the Commission to impose development-level
mitigation for a project that is not before it as a condition of its action on a BPA to remove a
PUA designation and that responsibility for mitigating significant impacts of the Ballpark Project
will in some instances be the responsibility of other agencies when issuing their entitlements
for the Ballpark Project.
Be It further resolved that, the Commission finds that the Applicant is required to apply for and
obtain a permit from the Commission to authorize those portions of its proposed Ballpark
Project that are in the Commission's Bay and shoreline band jurisdiction. The Commission
further finds that in considering any permit application submitted by the Applicant, the
Commission, as CEQA responsible agency for purposes of the Ballpark Project, will evaluate the
consistency of the proposed Ballpark Project with the Commission's laws and policies in place at that time, as well as any feasible alternatives and mitigation measures within the scope of the
Commission's authority and jurisdiction;
Be it further resolved that, the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission
authorizes the Executive Director to make minor, non-substantive editorial changes to this
Resolution, in particular to comply with the determinations of the Office of Administrative Law
in its review of the Resolution under the California Administrative Procedures Act.

We certify that this resolution was adopted by a vote of "yes" votes, "no" votes
and abstentions at the Commission meeting held June 30, 2022, in San Francisco,
California.
