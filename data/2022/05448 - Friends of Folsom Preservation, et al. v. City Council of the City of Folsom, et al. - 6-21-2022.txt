24 Petitioners FRIENDS OF FOLSOM PRESERVATION, DEBORAH GRASSL, TERRY
25 SORENSEN, and STEPHEN WALSH (hereinafter "Petitioners") petition this Court on their own
26 behalf, on behalf of their members, on behalf of the general public and in the public interest pursuant to
27 Code of Civil Procedure § 1094.5 and Public Res. Code $ 21168, or, in the alternative, pursuant to

28 Code of Civil Procedure $1085 and Publie Res. Code § 21168.5, for a writ of mandate, and for

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 declaratory and injunctive relief directed to Respondents CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF

2 FOLSOM and CITY OF FOLSOM (hereinafter "Respondents" or *City"), and by this verified petition

3 and complaint (*Petition"), allege as follows:

4 INTRODUCTION

5 l. This action challenges the approvals by the City of the Lakeside Memorial Lawn

6 Crematorium project (PN 19-182) ("Project"), including the conditional use permit ("CUP") for the

7 installation and operation of a crematorium at the Lakeside Memorial Lawn Cemetery (*Cemetery")

8 and the accompanying Initial Swudy and Mitigated Negative Declaration ("IS/MND") prepared for the

9 Project.

10 2. The City's approval of the IS/MND for the Project violates the California Environmental

11 Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Res. Code section 21000 et seq., and the CEQA Guidelines, California

12 Code of Regulations, Title 14, section 15000 et seq. Undisputed expert opinion from knowledgeable

13 historic groups and the City's own Historic District Commission, as well as the Project's

14 inconsistencies with the City's ordinances and design guidelines intended to protect the Historic

15 District, provided substantial evidence of a fair argument that the Project may have potentially

16 significant adverse impacts on the historic resources of the Folsom Historic District, and that the

17 significance of these impacts may not be reduced to insignificance by the Project's proposed mitigation

18 measures. Because the record includes substantial evidence of a fair argument that the Project may have

19 significant impacts on historic resources, the City could not rely on an IS/MND but instead had to

20 prepare an Environmental Impact Report (*EIR") for the Project.

21 3. In addition, the description of the Project included in the IS/MND inaccurately and
22 inconsistently depicts the Project. One illustration created by the Real Party in Interest depicts a short

23 exhaust stack extending only a few feet above the roofline of the maintenance building where the

24 Project is proposed to be löcated. In contrust, the manufacturer's drawings of the crematorium show an

25 exhaust stack with a height of 29.5 feet, which will extend (9.5 feet above the roof. The air modeling

26 for the Project assumed a third and different height of 19.5 feet from the ground for the exhaust stack.

..
27 Because of this unstable and fluctuating description of the Project, the is IS/MND is insufficient as a

28 matter of law.

2
Verified Petition for W.rit of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

4. The Project proposal to site a crematorium in the City's Open Space zoning district is

2 inconsistent with the uses authorized for that zoning district. No incinerators, in particular a

3 crematorium, are authorized as either permitted or accessory use in the Open Space zoning district.

4 The only accessory uses contemplated by the Historic District open space zoning is "[r]esidential uses

5 accessory to a public use." (Folsom Muni. Code, § 17.52.550(A)(7).)

6 5. The Historic District Zoning Code provides for a nonconforming use, if the use was

7 "legally in place as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter[,]" i.e. October 1998.

8 (Code §17.52.680.) As a result, no new nonconforming use, such as a crematory, can be approved by
9 the City.

10 6. The Project is proposed to be installed within a Nonconforming Structure at the

11 Cemetery, as defined by the Folsom Historic District Design and Development Guidelines

12 ("Guidelines"), §4.16.02. The City's Code and the Guidelines make the continuation of a
13 nonconforming structure, like the maintenance building where the Project will be located, contingent

14 on several conditions, including that "[t]he nonconformity is not increased....*" (Code

15 §17.52.690(B)(2); Guidelines § 4.16.02.) The Project will expand the nonconformity of the structure by

16 adding an exhaust stack that, according to the manufacturer's drawings, will extend about 19.5 feet

17 above the nonconforming maintenance building. In addition, the Project will add two large propane

18 tanks adjacent to the structure, which also expand the nonconformity.

19 7. Folsom prejudicially abused its discretion by failing to proceed in a manner required by

20 law, and these violations of law precluded informed public participation and informed decision making.
21 8. This is also an action for appropriate injunctive relief in the event that Respondents

22 and/or Real Parties proceed to implement the Project prior to the final resolution of this action.

23 9. The City's violations of CEQA and the City's Municipal Code and Guidelines, and

24 approval of the Project based thereon, will harm Petitioners, their members and the public because

25 environmental values will be degraded without the required level of environmental review and the

26 protections adopted to protect the integrity of the Historic District will be contravened if the Project
27 proceeds.

16 20. Petitioners have a direct and beneficial interest in Folsom's compliance with CEQA, the

17 CEQA Guidelines, and thè City's ordinances and design guidelines adopted to protect, preserve and

18 restore the City's Historic District. Petitioner and its' members are interested in ensuring that the Project

19 iS approved in a way that protects the environment and its historic resources. That interest has been and

20 will continue to be directly and adversely affected by Folsom's actions challenged herein, which

21 actions violate provisions of law set forth in this Petition, preclude informed public participation, and

22 will cause or threaten to cause substantial harm to the environment. Petitioners will suffer concrete,

23 actual and imminent injury from Folsom's prejudicial abuse of discretion as well as from

24 implementation of the proposed Project without full compliance with® CEQA and the City's applicable

25 ordinances and guidelines.

26 21. Respondent and defendant CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF FOLSOM is the

10 Real Parties in Interest and Defendants IGOR SEMENYUK and CARING SERVICE

11 GROUP are the applicants for the Project. The Notice of Determination filed by the City of Folsom
identifies "Igor Semenyuk (Caring Service Group)" as the "Project Applicant." Public Res. Code §
12 21167.6.5(a) requires that a petitioner "shall name, as a real party in interest, the person or persons

13

14 identified by the public agency in its notice. . . ."(Public Res. Code § 21167.5.) For this reason,

15 Petitioner names lgor Semenyuk and Caring Service Group as real parties in interest and defendants.

16 24. ST'ATEMENT OF FACTS

17

18 The Folsom Historic District is localed on the western border of Folsom adjacent to the
American River. The District is the' location where Folsom began in the 1850s and is intended to

19 preserve the first 100 years of Folsom's history from 1850 through 1950. The District includes the

20 Lakeside Lawn Memorial Cemetery ("Lakeside Cemetery"). In operation since the 19th century, the

21 L'akeside Cemetery encompasses several historic cemeteries, including the Masonic, Odd Fellows,

22 Jewish, Citizen's and Cook's cemeteries. The Lakeside Cemetery is adjacent to the Chung Wah

23 Cemetery. The Chung Wah Cemetery is listed on the' National Register of Historic Places. On its

24

25 southern side, the Historic District and Lakeside Cemetery are bordered by historic mine tailing piles.
The Lakeside Cemetery, the Chung Wa Cemetery and the mine tailings are all included on the City's

26 Cultural Resources Inventory List. The Sacramento County Board of Supervisors and the Sacramento

27 County Cemetery Advisory Commission (**Cemetery Advisory Commission") have designated

28 Lakeside Cemetery and the Chung Wa Cemctery as historic.

25. In 2002, an application was submitted for a CUP authorizing the installation and

Verified Petition for. Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

-,

operation of a crematorium at the Lakeside Cemnetory. The proposal was to site the crematorium in the

2 same grounds maintenance building as proposed by the current Project. That same year, a draft

3 IS/MND was prepared for that proposed crematorium and released for public comment. The Cemetery

4 Advisory Commission submitted comments on the IS/MND indicating that the proposed crematorium

5 would have an adverse impact on the historical cemetery and the historical use of the area. The

6 Cemetery Advisory Commission stated that "[f]urther degradation of the historic value of the cemetery

7 by the addition of a crematorium would only serve to lessen its cultural importance to the City of

8 Folsom and Sacramento County." In 2003, the staff for the City's Historic District Commission
9 prepared a staff report for the proposed crematorium recommending that the Historic District

10 Commission deny the project based on the Cemetery Advisory Commission's comments and the

11 negative impact on the historical character of the existing cemetery and historical use of the area that

12 would result from the crematorium. Among other conclusions, the 2003 staff report found that

13 "[a]pproval of a Conditional Use Permit for a contemporary land use (i.e., the crematorium) may
14 jeopardize the eligibility status of the site and might work to discourage rather than to encourage

15 National Register nomination." 2003 Staff Report, p. 3. "Based on the information provided to staff by

16 the Sacramento County Historic Cemetery Commission, a crematorium is not a consistent, or authentic,

17 use with a historic cemetery." Id. The staff report identified a number of goals and policies which the

18 City had established in the Historic District Design and Development Guidelines. As a result of its

19 analysis, staff recommended that the Historic District Commission deny the 2002 application for the

20 crematorium.

21 26. Prior to being considered by the Hisloric District Commission, the applicant for the 2002

22 crematorium proposal withdrew the application.

23 27. On May 16.2019, Real Party in Interest Igor Semenyuk submitted development

24 application seeking the issuance of a CUP for a crematorium to be located at the Miller Funeral Home

25 on Scott Street in Folsom. Subsequently, it was determined that this location would not be feasible to

26 locate a crematorium. At that point, Real Party proposed instead to locate the crematorium at the

;. 4 27 Lakeside Cemetery at the same location as previously proposed in 2002.

28 28. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that, on or about December

7
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

17. 2020, Real Parties submitted a scope of work for the Project and an application for the CUP.

2 29. The Project proposes to install a crematory within the existing 1,071 square foot

3 maintenance building. The shed was constructed sometime between 1993 and August 1998. The shed

4 predates the City's historic district zoning ordinance which was enacted in October 1998. Thus, the

5 shed was constructed at the time without consideration of the criteria established in the Municipal Code

6 and the October 1998 Design Guidelines. On information and belief, Petitioners allege that the shed

7 was not designed to comply with any historic design criteria or guidelines. Rather than reflect any

8 historic character of the District between 1850 and 1950. the shed is a metal shed constructed in the late

9 1990s. Based on information and belief, Petitioners allege that the shed has a flat roof that slopes from

10 about 15 feet at the front of the structure to 10 feet at the rear of the structure. The crematory is

11 proposed to be located along the rear wall of the structure.

12 30. The roof of the building would be cut open to accommodate the exhaust stack of the

13 crematory. Drawings provided by the manufacturer of the crematory depict an exhaust stack extending

14 354.11 inches, i.e., 29.5 feet, from ground level. An exhaust stack with that height will extend about

15 19.5 feet above the roof of the existing maintenance building. A rendering of the exhaust stack attached

16 to' the IS/MND and prepared by the Real Party in Interest depicts a stack extending a few feet above the

17 rear roof of the shed. In preparing air pollution modcling for the Project, the City's consultant Helix

18 "commented that the analysis done for the IS/MND assumed a height of 19.5 feet from finished grade

19 based on specifications provided to them by the applicant."

20 31. The Project would require the installation of two 250-gallon propane tanks on a concrete

21 pad along the northern side of the maintenance building. This would be the source of fuel for the

22 crematorium.

23 32. Real Parties propose to incinerate up to four bodies per day. Each cremation takes an

24 average of 90 minutes. Up to 500 cremations per year would be conducted by the Project.

25 33. The maintenance building and its roof are visible to Petitioners and other people walking
26 through and adjacent to the cemetery, as well as nearby residents. Petitioners and other people will

27 observe the crematory's exhaust stäck and its operation while they are using and enjoying the historic

28 cemetery and surroundings. The intrusion of the exhaust stack, incinerator emissions, and fuel tanks

8
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

into Petitioners' and other's use of the Historic District will diminish their experience of that unique

2 historic resource.

34. The Cemetery Advisory Commission communicated to staff that the Commission met

4 regarding the proposed Project and that the comments they made in 2002 still stand. In its decision

5 denying the CUP for the Project, the Historic District Commission determined that the Project would

6 have significant impacts on the adjacent historic resources. Other knowledgeable commentors with

7 local expertise on the historic significance of the Cemetery and the Historic District, including for

8 example the Chinese Historical Society of America and the Heritage Preservation League of Folsom,

9 submitted comments identifying its potential impacts to the Historic District and its use.

10 LEGAL BACKGROUND

11 The California Environmental Quality Act

12 35. The F.IR is the very heart of CEQA. (Bakersfield Citizens for Local Control v. City of

13 Bakersfield (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1214; Pocket Protectors v. City of Sacramento (2004) 124 Cal.

14 App. 4th 903, 927.) The EIR is an "environmental 'alarm bell' whose purpose is to alert the public and
15 its responsible officials to environmental changes before they have reached the ecological points of no

16 return." (Bakersfield•Citizens, 124 Cal.App.4th at 1220.) The EIR also functions as a "document of

17 accountability," intended to "demonstrate to ani apprehensive citizenry that the agency has, in fact,

18 analyzed and considered the ecological implications of its action." (Laurel Heights Improvements Assn.

19 Regents of University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392.) The EIR process "protects not only
a.
20 the environment but also informed self-government." (Pocket Protectors, 124 Cal.App.4th 927.)

21 36. "The purpose of an (EIR] is to provide public agencies and the public in general with

22 detailed information about the effect which a proposed project is likely to have on the environment; to

23 list ways in which the significant effects of such a projèct might be minimized; and to indicate
24 alternatives to such a project." (Public Res. Code § 21061; see also § 21002.1.) An EIR "serves not

25 only to protect the environment but also to demonstrate to the public that it is being protected." (14

26 CCR 4op 15003(b).) "The requirement of detailed statement helps insure the integrity of the process of

27 decision by precluding stubborn problems or serious criticisms from being swept under the rug."

28 (Sutter Sensible Planning, Inc. v. Board of Supervisors (1981) 122 Cal.App.3d 813, 820.) "The EIR

9
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

- process protects not only the environment but also informed self-government." (Laurel Heights
2 Improvement Ass n, supra, 47 Cal.3d at 392.)

3 37.

4 "[CEQA] requires the preparation of an EIR whenever it can be fairly argued on the

5 basis of substantial evidence that the project may have a significant environmental impact." (No Oil,

6 Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75; sec Friends of "B" Street v. City of Hayward
(1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 988, 1002; Public Res. Code § 21080(c)-(d).)

7 38.

8 The fair argument standard creates a "low threshold" for further environmental review

9 and "reflects a preference for resolving doubls in favor of environmental review when the question is

10 whether any such review is warranted." (Sierra Club v. Sonoma (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1307, 1316-17.)

11 Under the "fair argument" test, an EIR is required if any substantial evidence indicates that a project

12 may have an adverse environmental effect, even if contrary evidence exists to support the agency's

13 decision. (Dunn-Edwards, 9 Cal.App.4th at 655; Pocket Protectors, supra, 124 Cal.App.4th at 931.)

14 "[l]f the court perceives there was substantia! evidence that the project might have an adverse impact,

15 but the agency failed to secure preparation of an EIR, the agency's action must be set aside because the

16 agency abused its discretion by failing to follow the law." (Id.) The "fair argument" standard is

17 virtually the opposite of the typical deferential standard accorded to agencies.

39.

18 "Significant environmental effect" is defined very broadly as "a substantial or

19 potentially substantial adverse change in the environment." (Public Res: Code cc 21068; see also

20 Guidelines 15382.) An effect on the environment need not be "momentous" to meet the CEQA test for

21 significance; it is enough that the impacts are "not trivial." (No•Oil, Inc., supra, 13 Cal.3d 68, 83.)

40.

22 "Where an agency fails to provide an accurate project description, or fails to gather
information and undertake an

23 adequate environmental analysis in its initial study, a negative
declaration is inappropriate. An accurate and complete project description is necessary to fully evaluate
24 the project's potential environmental effects."(Nelson v. Cnty. of Kern (2010) 190 Cal.App.4th 252,

25 267.)

26

27 City of Folsom Municipal Code and Historie District Design and•Development Guidelines

41.

28 The City's Zoning Code establishes t comprehensive program not only to preserve the
historic character of the Historic District but also to enhance it. Thus, core purposes of the zoning for

10
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

8

the historic district include "[tlo proserve and enhance the historic, small-town atmosphere of the

2 historic district as it developed between the years 1850 and 1950; ... [t]o ensure that new

3 commercial development is consistent with the historical character of the historic district as it

4 developed between the years 1850 and 1950; ... and "[t]o preserve and enhance open space areas."

5 (Folsom Muni. Code § 17.52.010(B)(1), (5) & (7).)

6 42. On October 1, 1998, the City adopted the Historic District Design and Development

7 Guidelines ("Guidelines") "to provide a comprehensive policy manual to assist with the

8 implementation of the regulations contained in Chapter 17.52 of the Folsom Municipal Code."

9 43. The open space areas of the historic district permit a "cemeteries" use. (Code
10 §17.52.550(A)(4).) Cemetery is defined as "a burial ground." The New Oxford American Dictionary, p.

11 275 (Oxford University Press (2d ed. 2005). On the other hand, a "crematorium" or "crematory" is "a

12 place where a dead person's body is cremated." (Id.. p. 398.)

.13 44. :**Accessory use means a use or building incidental or subordinate to the principal use
:14 of building located upon the same lot." (Code, $17.012.030.) The only accessory uses identified in the

15 Historic District open space zoning are "[r]esidential uses accessory a to a public use." (Id.,
•16 §17.52.550(A)(7).) There is no general authority at all for accessory uses in the zoning code for the

17 Historic District, with the exception of accessory uses associated with accessory structures for

18 residences. (See Code §17.52.540.)

19 45. The Historic District Zoning Code provides for a' nonconforming use, if the use was

20 "legally in place as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter[]" i.e., October 1998.

21 (Code $17.52.680.) As a result, no new nonconforming use can be approved by the City. This

22 prohibition is not contingent on whether the use is a principle use or án accessory use. The Guidelines

23 recognize that mechanical equipment is generally' incompatible "with the design time frames of much

24 of the Historic District and [have] inherent aesthetic drawbacks...."* (Guidelines, $4.03.)

25 46. "A structure Or part thereof is detcrmined to be legally nonconforming if it was legally

26 in place on the effectiveness date of Ordinance No. 890 but by reason of style, construction or

27 placement it does not meet the standards or intent of the Primary Area or Subarea cause a structure or

28 part thereof to be deemed nonconforming." (Guidelines, $4.16.02.) The Code and the Guidelines make

11
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

the continuation of a nonconformning structure, like the shed, contingent on several conditions,

2 including that "[t]he nonconformity is not increased...." (Code §17.52.690(B)(2); Guidelines {

3 4.16.02.)

4 PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

5 47. Ön or about January 7, 2022, the City released the IS/MND. The City provided a public

6 comment period from January 7, 2022 through February 7, 2022. Petitioners Deborah Grassl and Terry
Sorensen each submitted written comments during the public comment period.

8 48. On February 16, 2022, the Historic District Commission held a public hearing on the

9 Project's proposed CUP and the IS/MND. Petitioners Grassl and Stephen Walsh each appeared at the

10 hearing and made oral comments objecting to the Project and the IS/MND. At the conclusion of the

11 hearing, the Historic District Commission voted to deny the Project by a vote of 6-1.

12 49. On February 22, 2022, Real Party in Interest Igor Semenyuk appealed the Historic

13 District Commission's denial of the Project to the City Council.

14 50.. The City it issued a notice that it would hold a hearing on April 26, 2022 to hear the

15 .appeal. Petitioners Grasst, Sorensen, and Walsh cach filed additional written comments in advance of

16 the City Council hearing.

17 51. On April 26, 2022, the City Council held a hearing to-consider the appeal. Petitioners

18 Grassl, Sorensen, and Walsh appeared at the City Council meeting and objected to the Project. The City

19 Council continued the hearing without making a decision.

20 52. On May 10, 2022, the City Council reconvened the hearing. At the conclusion of the

21 hearing, the City Council voted 3-2 to grant the appeal, overturn the Historic District Commission's

22 decision, and approve the Project and its accompanying IS/MND.

23 53. On May 13, 2022, the Sacramento County Clerk's Office filed a Notice of
24 Determination ("NOD") submitted by the City for the Project.

25 54. During the' review process for this Project, Petitioners or other commenters timely raised

26 each and every significant substantive and procedural issuc alleged in this Petition in compliance with
27 Public Res. Code § 21 1 77. Petitioners and others requested that Respondents refrain from approving

28 this Project and the IS/MND until Respondents fully comply with CEQA and the City's Ordinances,

12
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandatc and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

including requiring preparation of an EIR to analyze and mitigate the Project's environmental impacts.

2 Any further exhaustion would be futile.

3 55. Petitioners have no plain, specdy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law

4 unless this Court enjoins and mandates that Respondents comply, with their duties and set aside the

5 approval of thie Project. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' approvals will remain in effect

6 in violation of CEQA.

7 56. If Respondents and Real Parties and their agents are not enjoined from implementing the

8 Project, and from undertaking acts in furtherance thereof, Petitioners will suffer irreparable harm from

9 which there is no adequate remedy at law in that the Project area and surrounding areas would be

10 irrevocably altered and significant unmitigated adverse environmental impacts would occur.

11 Petitioners and the general public have also been harmed'by Respondents' failure to prepare an EIR for
12 this Project.

13 57. In pursuing this action, which involves enforcement of important rights affecting the
14 public interest, Petitioners will confer a substantial benefit on the general public and citizens of the City

15 of Folsom, Sacramento Courity, and the State of California, and therefore will be entitled to attorney's

16 fees and costs pursuant to, inter alia, Code of Civil Procedure § 1021.5.

17 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
18 (Violation of CEQA - Need to Prepare an EIR)

19 58. Respondents failed to comply with CEQA by failing to prepare an EIR for the Project

20 despite substantial evidence in the record of a lair argument that the Project may have one or more

21 significant environmental impacts, including but not limited to the following:

22 a. There is substantial evidence supporting : fair argument that the Project will have

23 significant historic impacts. There is substantial evidence that the operation of the

24 Project may have significant impacts on the cultural resources of the Historic

25 District. Substantial evidence also demonstrates that the Project's external
components including an exhaust stack extending up to 29.5 feet in height as well as 26
propane tanks will have significant impact on the Folsom Historic District by
27 adding a nonconforming use within the District which adversely affects the historic
28

13
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 and cultural integrity of the District and detracts from its potential to be listed on the

2 Nationa! Register of Historic.Piaces.

3 b. There is substantial evidence supporting a fair argument that the Project will have

4 significant impacts on land usc and planning. The Project conflicts with the land use

5 planning, policies and regulations adopted by the City to avoid adverse impacts on

6 the Historic District.

7 59. By failing to prepare an EIR, in light of the substantial evidence of these potentially

8 significant adverse impacts which will not be reduced by proposed mitigations, Respondents failed to

9 proceed in a manner required by law, failed to comply with CEQA and prejudicially abused their

10 discretion.

11 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
(Violation of CEQA -
12 IS/MND is deficient as a matter of law and not supported by substantial evidence)
13 60. Petitioner incorporates by reference hcrein the preceding paragraphs, as if fully set forth.

14 61. * The description of the Project included in the IS/MND inaccurately and inconsistently
* 15 depicts the Project. The IS/MND fails to provide an accurate description of the Project providing no

16 less than three different versions of the height and prominence of the exhaust stack. The presence of an

17 exhaust stack is a nonconforming structure and use within the Historic District. The absence of an

18 accurate description of this key element of the Project prevented the City from fully evaluating the

19 Project's potential impacts to air quality, historic resources, aesthetics, and land uses.
20 62. The IS/MND's discussion of the Project's potential impacts to historic resources is not

21 based on substantial evidence. In preparing the IS/MND, the City failed to adequately investigate the

22 Project's potential impacts on historic resources, in particular the integrity of the Historic District as a

23 whole. Rather than investigate the impacts on the Historic District as a whole, the IS/MND assessment

24 of historic resource impacts is unreasonably limited to whether particular artifacts would be disturbed

25 by the Project. Given the designation by the City of the entire Historic District as a historic resource

26 and the stated goals of maintaining the District's historic integrity as a whole, the IS/MND's analysis is

27 incomplete.

28 63. Because the IS/MND fails to provide an accurate project description and improperly

14
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief :

-*

2 truncated the investigation and discussion of the Project's impacts on the Historic District,

3 Respondents' approval of the IS/MND failed to proceed in a manner required by law, failed to comply
with CEQA and prejudicially abused their discretion.

THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

5 (Abuse of Discretion - Section 1085 or alternatively 1094.5 -

6 Inconsistency with Historic District zoning)
64.

7 65. Petitioner incorporates by reference herein the preceding paragraphs, as if fully set forth.

8 The City abused its discretion in issuing the CUP for a crematory use that is a prohibited
nonconforming use within the Historic District and otherwise not authorized by the City's zoning for
9 the Historic District.
10 66.

11 The City erred as a matter of law in issuing the CUP because no incinerators, in

12 particular a crematorium, are authorized as either permitted or accessory use in the Open Space

13 zoning district. The only accessory uses contemplated by the Historic District open space zoning is

* 14 *[r]esidential uses accessory to a public use." (Folsom Muni. Code, § 17.52.550(A)(7).)

67.

15 The City erred as a matter of law by a authorizing a new nonconforming use within the

16 Historic District. The Historic District Zoning Code provides for a nonconforming use, if the use was

17 "legally in place as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter[,J" i.e., October 1998.

18 (Code §17.52.680.) As a result, no new nonconforming use, such as a crematory, can be approved by
the City.
19 68.

20 The City further erred as a matter of law and abused its discretion by issuing a CUP that

21 would unlawfully expand an existing nonconforming structure. The Project is proposed to be installed

22 within a Nonconforming Structure at the Cemetery, as defined by the Guidelines. §4.16.02. The City's

23 Code and the Guidelines make the continuation of a nonconforming structure, like the maintenance

24 building where the Project will be located, contingent on several conditions, including that "[t]he

25 nonconformity is not increased...." (Code §17.52.690(B)(2); Guidelines § 4.16.02.) The Project will
expand the nonconformity of the structure by adding an exhaust stack that, according to the
26 manufacturer's drawings, will extend about 19.5 feet above the roof of the nonconforming maintenance
27

28 building. The Project also would expand the nonconförming use by authorizing the installation of two

15
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

L

propane tanks.

2 69. For these reasons, by approving the CUP for the Project, the City failed to proceed in a
3 manner required by law and prejudicially abused its discretion.
PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for relief as follows:

6 1. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents to set aside the approval of the

7 Mitigated Negative Deciaration, the CUP, and any and all approvals given for the Project in reliance

8 thereon;

9 2. For a peremptory writ of mandate declaring that the City's approval of the Project is

10 inconsistent with the City's Historic District Zoning Code and the Folsom Historic District Design and

11 Development Guidclines.

12 3. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents to fully comply with CEQA

13 prior to any Project approval, and take any öther action required pursuant to Public Resources Code

14 section 21168.9;

15 4. For • a stay, temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and a permanent
16 injunction restraining all Respondents and Real Parties and their agents, servants and employees, and

17 all others acting in concert with them or in their behalf, from undertaking any action to implement in

18 any way the Project, pending full compliance with CEQA, Historic District Zoning Code, and all other
19  requirements of law;

20 5. For costs of the suit incurred hercin;

21 6. For attorneys' fees pursuant to section 1021.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the

22 common law private attorncy general doctrine, and any other applicable provision of law; and

23 7. For such other and further relicf as the Court deems just and proper.
