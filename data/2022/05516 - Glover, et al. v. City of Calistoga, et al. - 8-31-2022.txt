Re: Notice of Commencement of Legal Action Pursuant to CCP § 388

Dear Sir/Madam:

This is to advise you that Michael P. Glover and Curtis J. Wilhelm (collectively
"Petitioner") have filed a writ of mandate to set aside the decision of City of Calistoga ("Respondent") to adopt Resolution 2022-042 denying Petitioner's appeal and effectively approving a project for a winery use permit and design review application, and upholding application of a Class 3 Categorical Exemption regarding Respondent's CEQA review. Petitioner submits this notice pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 388.
The action was filed on August 2, 2022 and is based on Respondents' failure to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act, its own General Plan and Zoning Ordinance, and the SRA/VHFHSZ Fire Regulations. The action alleges that Respondent violated law by applying the Class 3 Categorical Exemption, took several actions inconsistent with its own General Plan, unreasonably interpreted its own Zoning Code, and violated the SRA/VHFHSZ
Fire Regulations.

Sincerely,

DICKENSON, PEATMAN & FOGARTY

22 INTRODUCTION

23 1. This action seeks to halt the illegal expansion of a hotel in a residential

24 neighborhood. In its zeal to increase tax revenues to the City of Calistoga, its City Council and

25 Planning Commission (collectively, "*City" or "Respondent"), ignored or violated numerous State

26 and local legal requirements.

27 2. As set forth below, the City failed to follow its own zoning code by mislabeling

28 the hotel as a "Bed a and Breakfast" ("B&B"), disregarded or manipulated the zoning requirements

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 for B&Bs, failed to analyze the impacts of the hotel on the environment and neighbors, and

2 ignored unambiguous State requirements for projects in the Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone

3 (*VHFHSZ").

4 3. The City's actions are an abuse of discretion as it has not proceeded in the mannerl

5 provided by law, the decision is not supported by the findings, and the findings are not supported

6 by the evidence.

7 4. Michael P. Glover and Curtis J. Wilhelm (collectively "Petitioner") reside

8 immediately adjacent to the hotel. They hereby seek review and reversal of the decision of the

9 City's approval of the expansion of the Aurora Park Cottages hotel.

10 5. The expansion was initially approved on February 26, 2020, but that approval

11 expired. The plans called for expansion of an existing nominal B&B to (1) construct four
ALaVDOA A NVNIVEd 'NOSNINDICI 12 additional one-bedroom cottages; (2) construct six additional parking spaces and reconfigure one
DP&F uoyvaod4og avl pouopssaford y 13 existing space; (3) convert an existing two-bedroom guest cottage to a front office reception area

14 manager's unit; and (4) new landscaping at and around the cottages. The parcel is 1.44 acres and is

15 located at 1807 Foothill Boulevard, Calistoga, California, 94515 (APN 011-290-051-000) (the

16 "Parcel").

17 6. The Project was never implemented before its expiration. Following the 20201

18 wildfires, and the updates to the State Responsibility Area ("SRA/VHFHSZ") Fire Safel

19 Regulations, the Project was revived on February 9. 2022 without any meaningful analysis, and

20 the City's Planning Commission ("Planning Commission") approved Renewal of Use Permit

21 2022-1 and Design Review 2022-1 (the "Project").

22 7. As discussed in detail below, Petitioner repeatedly opposed the Project. The

23 Planning Commission approved Applicant David Patel and 1807 Foothill, LLC d/b/a Aurora Park

24 Cottages' renewal of the Project over Petitioner's objection, which Petitioner timely appealed to

25 the City of Calistoga City Council ("City Council"'). On appeal, the City Council remanded the
26 Project for further consideration to the Planning Commission. The Project was again approved by

27 the Planning Commission on April 27, 2022.

28 8. Petitioner timely appealed this decision on remand to the City Council, which

2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

thereafter voted to deny the appeal and effectively uphold the Planning Commission's approval

2 on June 7, 2022, adopting Resolution No. 2022-042 (the "Resolution").

9. On June 28, 2022, Respondent filed a Notice of Exemption with the State Officel

4 of Planning and Research finding the Project categorically exempt from the requirements of the

5 California Environmental Quality Act (*CEQA"). This action is timely filed within 35 days of that

6 notice.

7 10. In approving the Project, Respondent failed to comply with CEQA, the
8 SRA/VHFHSZ Fire Safe Regulations, and several elements and sections of the City's General

9 Plan and Municipal Code, respectively.

10 11. Respondent approved the Project in violation of law by inappropriately relying on

11 CEQA Guidelines § 15303 - New Construction or Conversion of Small Structures (Class 3)

DP&F ALaVDOJ A NVNlVad'NOSNIXDICI 12 effectively bypassing review of the Project's potentially significant environmental impacts.
uonvaod102 Mv1 puoissafoad V 13 Respondent relied on this categorical exemption despite the Project failing to meet the plain text of

14 the Guidelines' requirements under §§ 15303 et. seq. It also erroneously concluded the

15 §§ 15300.2(b) and (c) exceptions to the categorical exemption for cumulative impacts and unusual

16 circumstances did not otherwise apply, despite there being a reasonable possibility that the Project

17 will have a significant impact on the environment given the Project's residential location in a Very

18 High Fire Hazard Severity Zone ("VHFHSZ").

19 12. Further, Respondent approved the Project in violation of its own General Plan and
20 numerous provisions of the City of Calistoga Municipal Code (*CMC"). Respondent's

21 interpretation of the City's General Plan is clearly inconsistent with its interpretation of its Zoning

22 Code, and its interpretation of several of its Zoning Code provisions is unreasonable and

23 unsupported by the evidence.

24 13. Respondent also approved the Project in violation of SRA/VHFHSZ Fire Safe

25 Regulations, Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 1270 et seq., including Sections 1270.03(a) and (c). Given

26 these failures, Respondent approved the Project in violation of law.

27 14. The Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court vacate and set aside the denial

28 of the appeal and approval of the Project and order Respondent to comply with CEQA, its own

3

AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

General Plan and Municipal Code, and the SRA/VHFHSZ Fire Safe Regulations.

28 et. seq.

4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

21. Venue for this action properly lies in the Napa County Superior Court because the

2 proposed site of the Project is located in the City of Calistoga within this County. Further, any

3 significant environmental impacts of the Project that are the subject of this lawsuit would occur
within Napa County, and the Project would impact the interests of residents within Napa County.

22. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code § 21167.5

6 by serving a written notice of Petitioner's intention to commence this action on Respondent by

7 electronic mail on July 29, 2022 and again by mail on August 1, 2022. A copy of the written notice

8 was filed concurrently with this Petition and is attached hereto as Exhibit A. Per Public Resources
Code § 21167.6(b)(2), an Election to Prepare the Record has been served on Respondent and wasl

10 filed concurrently with this Petition, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit B.

11 23. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code § 21167.7
AIXVOOH 29 NVWIVId 'NOSNIXDICI 12 by sending a copy of this Petition to the California Attorney General on August 2, 2022. A copy of
DP&F 101pa0d100 Mgj jouopssafond y 13 the letter transmitting this Petition is attached hereto as Exhibit C. Verifications are attached as

14 Exhibit D.

15 24. The Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing this instant action

16 and has exhausted all administrative remedies to the extent required by law, including, but not

17 limited to, timely submitting appeals to approval of the Project by the Planning Commission and

18 presenting to Respondents the flaws in its reasoning in two hearings before each of the Planningl
19 Commission and City Council.

20 25. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

21 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondent to set aside approval

22 of the Project. In the absence of such remedies, Respondent's approval will remain in effect in

23 violation of state law.

24 BACKGROUND

25 Existing Conditions.

26 26. Applicant owns and operates on Parcel a commercial lodging facility known as the

a 27 Aurora Park Cottages (the "Cottages"). Applicant describes the Cottages on its own website as

28 "hotel." (See Aurora Park Cottages Website, available at www.aurorapark.com/explore).

5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 27. There are seven cottages available as guest accommodations, housed in separate
and 2 structures. The seven units are made up of six, 363 square-foot ("sf') one-bedroom cottages

3 one 871 sf two-bedroom cottage with a kitchen. Because the Cottages has more than six units, it

4 meets the City's definition of a "hotel". (CMC § 17.04.360.)

5 28. The Cottages are located at 1807 Foothill Boulevard (State Highway 128),

6 approximately one-half mile north of the intersection of State Highways 128 & 29 and Lincoln

7 Avenue in Calistoga, on the west side of the street.

8 29. The Parcel and Petitioner's property are located within the Brannan Ridge Estates

9 Subdivision ("Subdivision"). The Subdivision was approved in a recorded 1998 Parcel Map

10 (*Parcel Map"), and is further subject to Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions ("CC&Rs")

11 which were recorded with Napa County that same year.

ALXVDO  2 NVNIVEd 'NOSNINDICI 12 30. Guest and manager access to the cottages is only via a private drive a located off of
DP&F MOJWA0d409 MD7 (DHOjSS2JO4d V 13 Foothill Boulevard. The private drive serves the entire Subdivision, which includes several single-

14 family residences and the Cottages. Per the CC&Rs and Parcel Map, access via the private drive is

15 governed by a "private" driveway, drainage and utility easement for the benefit of all parcels in the

16 Subdivision. The Subdivision is also subject to an open space easement, which restricts

17 development of a substantial amount of acreage across the Subdivision's parcels.

18 31. The Cottages have already established eight parking spaces along the private drive.

19 Per the above, Petitioner shares an access easement over this private drive with the Applicant, and
20 all access and parking to the Project is off of this shared driveway.

21 32. The common area and space directly surrounding the cottages is wholly occupied

22 by walkways and landscaping which is purely designed to serve B&B guests. Below is a picture a

11 33. Guest reception is currently operated from a building located across the privatel
12 drive from the guest cottages at 1815 Foothill Boulevard, which is a separate legal parcel. As such,
residence nor other residence is DPEF uoppaod109 MD1 jpuojssafoid k A1XVDO  A NVNIVEd 'NOSNENDICI 13 there is no existing residential use on the Parcel-no manager

14 currently maintained on Parcel, which is a requirement for operating a Bed and Breakfast.

15 Proposed Project.

16 34. The Project proposes (1) construction of four additional 600-sf one-bedroom

17 cottages; (2) construction of six additional parking spaces and reconfiguration of one existing;

18 (3) conversion of the existing two-bedroom guest cottage to a front office reception area and

19 manager's unit, including 661-sf addition for a new total of 1,532 sf; and (4) new landscaping at

20 and around the cottages.
to a mixed-use 21 35. Given the existing two-bedroom guest cottage will be converted
guest reception, office, and manager residence, the Project will result in a total of ten guest units, 22

23 as well as fourteen parking spaces.

24 General Plan Designation and Zoning Regulations.

25 36. The Parcel is designated Low-Density Residential under the City's General Plan

26 and is zoned R-1-10: One-Family Zoning District (*R-1-10"). The purpose of this Designation and

27 Zoning is to allow the development of single-family and special needs residential uses that are

28 consistent with the Calistoga General Plan and State law, in a manner that provides generous

7

private space and setbacks.

2 37. General Plan. Together with compatible accessory uses, the Low-Density

3 Residential Designation permits "schools, bed-and-breakfast inns; home occupations; and religious

4 facilities". "if they conform to all relevant General Plan policies[.]" (Land Use Element ("LU"),
LU-11.) In addition to the above, the following General Plan objectives, policies, and actions from

6 the Land Use Element are relevant.
a. Hotels are permitted for development in the Community Commercial Land Usel
Designation, not Low-Density Residential. (LU-11-12.)
O b. Objective LU 1.2: "[p]romote a balance between visitor-oriented and local-
10 serving commercial development." Policies: (1) P1.2-2: "[n]ew visitor

16 the predominantly residential character of established neighborhoods."

17 c. Objective LU 1.3: "[e]nsure that commercial and industrial development is

AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

a. "[A] wildfire behavior model is required to specify building setbacks and fire
resistive ratings…nearly all of the 370 acres south of Foothill Boulevard, which is
characterized by steep, wooded slopes is located within the Very High Fire Hazard
Severity Zone....'" (Public Safety Element, p. SAF-17.)

b. Goal SAF-3: "[p]rotect lives and property from wildland fire hazard." Objective
O SAF-3.1: "[p]lan new developments with wildland fire hazards in mind." Policy 1:

7 "[p]lans for development in the Very High Fire Hazard Area shall be reviewed for

8 their incorporation of design measures to reduce wildland fire risk."

39. The Circulation Element states:

10 a. Objective CIR-1.4: "[t]he City shall create and maintain a comprehensive and
11 integrated transportation network that provides safe, comfortable and convenient

AlHVDOH A NYNIVEd 'NOSNINDICI 12 travel, serving all types of users.3
DP&F voymaod109 M1 ppuojssaford V 13 40. Zoning.

14 a. Given its R-1-10 zoning, Foothill Boulevard consists of primarily single-family

15 residences. There is an existing B&B, the Chanric Inn. located directly south of the

16 Cottages at 1805 Foothill Boulevard. The Chanric Inn was formerly a single-

17 family dwelling that was converted to a B&B, with all units contained in one

18 residential structure. Other B&Bs in the zoning district are similarly single-family

19 dwellings with bedrooms converted to B&B units, unlike the Project which is

20 proposed to be ten stand-alone units, more similar to a hotel resort.

21 b. The Project meets the City's definition of a hotel under the CMC § 17.04.360 (*a

22 facility of six or more units located in a single structure or individual structures,

23 which may be connected by corridors or outdoor pedestrian walkways. The facility

24 shall have the primary purpose of providing transient lodging accommodations, as

25 contemplated by Chapter 3.16 CMC, to the general public.").

26 c. CMC § 17.04.023 states ''[a]ccessory use' shall mean a use that is incidental and

27 subordinate to a principal use on a site and is customarily found on the same

28 site." (Emphasis added.)

9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

2 d. Further, the City regulates B&Bs under CMC Chapter 17.35 (the "B&B Code").
The B&B Code regulates, inter alia, (1) primary & accessory use restrictions in R-

3 1-10 districts, (2) spacing requirements, and (3) maximum number of units.

4 e. B&Bs are defined as "the rental of rooms or space for the purpose of providing

5 overnight accommodations for paying guests for a period not to exceed 30 days

6 per individual rental, with not more than one meal to be provided daily, and with

7

8 the entire service offered to be included in one stated price." (CMC § 17.04.085.)

f. The B&B Code requires B&B uses to be accessory to a primary residential use on
parcels in R-1-10 districts. CMC § 17.35.010(D) states:
10
11 "It is further the purpose of these regulations to provide for bed and breakfast facilities which are accessory to and secondary to the primary residential use of land in residentially zoned areas. The

uonDIOd109 M71 ppuojssafoad V DICKENSON, PEATMAN & FOGARTY 12 terms "accessory" and "secondary" mean that the establishment of
DP&F 13 bed and breakfast facilities in residential zones shall not exceed 49

14 percent of the use of the land and/or building area on and in which
the facilities are to be located."

15 (Emphasis added.)

16 g. The B&B Code's requirements regarding maximum units are set out in CMC §S

17 17.35.040(C) et. seq.

18 i. In R-1-10 zones, a maximum of two units are allowed. (CMC c0

19 17.35.040(C)(2)(a).)

20 ii. The maximum number of B&B units may be increased to six, subject to a

21 major use permit, if the following special circumstances exist: (a)

22 proximity to a state highway; (b) historical character and/or significance of

23 structures; (c) character of proposed site relative to its surroundings; (d)

24 nature of ingress and egress; (e) adequacy of number and location of off-

25 street parking spaces and maneuvering areas; and (f) provision of roomsl

26 accessible to developmentally disabled. (CMC §§ 17.35.040(C)(3)(a)-(f).)

27 iii. Further, a limited exception allowing an increase to ten units (but no more)

28 can be met if in addition to the above special circumstances, the following

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 10

AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

are also met: (a) a B&B was authorized on

2 property before January 1,
2010; (b) the property is in an R-1-10 zone; (c) the property has

4 maximum of 10 units; and (d) there is a minimum lot size of 10,000 sf.
(CMC §§ 17.35.040(C)(4)(a)-(d).)

5 h. CMC §17.35.020(H) states that "[a]ll facilities shall be inspected on an annual

6 basis by the Planning and Building Department for conformance with use permit

7 conditions and the regulations established in this title. Inspection reports shall be

8 forwarded to the Planning Commission for informational purposes, as
necessary." (Emphasis added).

10 i

11 Further, all B&Bs require a use permit. (CMC § 17.35.030.) In conditionally

DP&F AIXVDOH AU NVNIVIJ NOSNINDICI 12 approving a use permit application, the CMC requires the local agency to find that

A Professional Law Corporation 13 the Project is, among others, (1) "in accord with the General Plan and any

14 applicable planned development"; (2) "[i]s in accord with all applicable provisions

15 of this title"; and (3) "[w]ill not substantially impair or interfere with the

16 development, use or enjoyment of other property in the vicinity." (CMC §

17.40.030(D)(1)-(3).)

17

18 Project area is designated Very High Fire Hazard Severity by CAL FIRE.

41.
19 The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection ("CAL FIRE")

20 classifies the severity of fire hazards in areas of California. Lands are either ranked Moderate,

21 High, or Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones. (CAL FIRE Website, available at

22 https://osfm.fire.ca.gov/divisions/community-wildfire-preparedness-and-mitigation/wildfire-

23 preparedness/fire-hazard-severity-zones/.) These classifications are determined by a science-based

24 and field-tested model which assigns a fire hazard score based on factors such as fire history,

25 existing and potential fuel, predicted flame length, blowing embers, terrain, and typical fire

weather for the area.
26 42.
27 The Parcel is located in the highest fire hazard category, Very High Fire Hazard

28 Severity Zone, at an urban-wildland interface between residential neighborhoods and the City. The

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 11

AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

2 adjacent hillsides are heavily wooded, and the Subdivision is covered in part by an open space
easement that preserves large swaths of the woodlands in the Subdivision.
43. In response to severe wildfire dangers and risks to the urban-wildland interface

4 from recent wildfires throughout the State, CAL FIRE amended, through rulemaking effective July

6 1, 2021, the State Responsibility Area Fire Safe Regulations to apply to the Very High Fire Hazard
Severity Zone, and renominated the SRA/VHFHSZ Fire Safe Regulations, Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14
§§ 1270.00 et seq. This rule change occurred between the City's approval of the Project prior to its
expiration and the subsequent renewal of the Project, and was applicable to the City's
consideration of the Project applied for in 2022.

10 44.

11 Sections 1270.03(a)-(c) of the SRA/VHFHSZ Fire Safe Regulations provide:

"(a)
AIAVDO  2g NVNIVEd NOSNINDIC 12 local jurisdictions shall provide the Director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection or their

DP&F A Professional Law Corporation 13 designee with notice of applications for building permits,

14 tentative parcel maps, tentative maps, and installation or use permits for construction or development within the SRA or,

(b) after July 1, 2021, the VHFHSZ;
15 the Director or their designee may review and make fire

16 protection recommendations on applicable construction or

(c) development permits or maps provided by the local jurisdiction;

17 the local jurisdiction shall ensure that the applicable sections of

18 this subchapter become a condition of approval of any
applicable construction or development permit or map."

19 (Emphasis added.)

20 45. The City was obligated to comply with the SRA/VHFHSZ Fire Safe Regulations

21 in consideration of the project, including Sections 1270.03(a) and (c) thereof, but based on the

22 record did not do so.

23 CEQA Categorical Exemption.

24 46. The Project is a "project" for the purposes of CEQA. Respondent determined that

25 the Project is Categorically Exempt from CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines § 15303 - New

26 Construction or Conversion of Small Structures (Class 3). This purpose of this exemption is to

27 exempt from CEQA's provisions the construction of limited, small facilities:

5 (b) A duplex or similar multi-family residential structure totaling no more than four dwelling units. In urbanized areas, this exemption applies to

6 apartments, duplexes, and similar structures designed for not more than six
dwelling units.

7 (c) A store, motel, office, restaurant or similar structure not involving the use of significant amounts of hazardous substances, and not exceeding 2,500 square feet in floor area. In urbanized areas, the

o exemption also applies to up to four such commercial buildings not exceeding 10,000 square feet in floor area on sites zoned for such use if

10 not involving the use of significant amounts of hazardous substances where all necessary public services and facilities are available and the

11 surrounding area is not environmentally sensitive..."

DICKENSON, PEATMAN & FOGARTY 12 (Emphasis added.)
47.
DP&F 101a0dI03 MD] ¡uoissaford y 13 Per the plain language of the above Guidelines, this exemption only allows for use

14 on a legal parcel of up to a four dwelling units in a non-urban area and not more than six dwelling|

15 units in an urban area. Further, the 2,500 square foot limitation is applicable to a single

16 commercial structure. (The Cottages are not in an urbanized area, and the 10,000-sf limit for four

17 structures is inapplicable.)

48.
18 City erroneously relied on this exemption by considering only the four additionall

19 structures to be built as part of the Project. However, the Project actually consists of five structures

20 four new cottages and significant construction to and expansion of a fifth and ignores that ten

21 total structures would exist on the Parcel after construction.

49.
22 City also mistakenly considered the four new structures together to be below the

23 2,500-sf limitation when Subsection C, by its own terms, only applies to one structure. Thus City

24 relied on this exemption in violation of the plain language of §§ 15303(b)-(c).

50.
25 Further, even if the Project qualified 3 for the Class 3 exemption (which it does not),

26 Respondent must confirm no categorical exceptions apply, including, inter alia, whether

27 cumulative impacts of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time, are

28 significant (CEQA Guidelines § 15300.2(b)), and whether unusual circumstances exist that could

AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

result in a significant impact on the environment. (CEQA Guidelines § 15300.2(c).)

2 51. As stated above, the Parcel is located in a Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone,

3 and upon completion will reach the B&B's absolute maximum of ten units in a low-density

4 residential neighborhood. Such a large commercial lodging facility--hotel or B&Bin a heavily

5 wooded urban-wildland interface covered in part by open space easements, and with the highest

6 fire risk designated by CAL FIRE. implicates unusual circumstances distinguishing the Project

7 from other categorically exempt projects.

8 52. Given very high fire risk generally in recent years, including nearby the project,

9 and subsequent updating of the SRA/VHFHSZ Fire Safe Regulations due to this increasing risk,

10 City should have at the very least prepared an initial study to determine potential environmental

11 impacts. Yet City claims that there is "no evidence" in the record that there is any reasonable
AIQVOO! A NVNIVAd NOSNINDIC 12 possibility that the Project will have a significant effect on the environment.
DP&F H0jDAOd409 MDT pu0jss2{04d V 13 53. Further, although the Chanric Inn B&B is located within 500 feet of the Parcel,

14 Respondent did not consider the significant expansion resulting from the Project may result in

15 significant cumulative impacts on the environment, traffic, and public safety despite the adjacent

16 proximity of these B&Bs.

17 PROCEDURAL HISTORY

18 Initial Project Approval and Expiration.

19 54. In 2018, Real Party in Interest initially applied for approval of the expansion of the

20 Cottages (Use Permit application 2018-12 and Design Review application 2018-9). The Planning

21 Commission approved those applications on February 26, 2020 - before the 2020 LNU Complex

22 and Glass Fires.

23 55. Condition of Approval 3 provided that the approval "shall be null and void if not

24 used within a one-year period," and that the Planning & Building Director may extend that time by

25 up to 12 months. The Project was approved on the grounds that it is allegedly consistent with the

26 General Plan designation for the property as low-density residential and the R-1-10 zoning district,

27 and that it was exempt categorically exempt from CEQA under Class 3 (discussed above).

28 56. Development on the Project was delayed. Thus, in December 2020, City Staff

14
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

granted a one-year

2 extension of the use permit and design review applications. However, with the
entitlements due to expire in March 2022, and Applicant aware that the Project could not be

4 undertaken within the extension period, Applicant requested renewal of its applications in early

2022.

57.

6 Applicant's renewal of the Project resulted in four hearings: (1) the February 9,

7 2022 Planning Commission hearing approving the Project; (2) the March 15, 2022 City Council

8 hearing on Petitioner's appeal of the February 9 approval, which remanded the Project to the

9 Planning Commission; (3) the April 27, 2022 Planning Commission remand hearing which again

10 approved the Project; and (4) the June 7. 2022 City Council hearing of Petitioner/Appellant's

11 further appeal following the remand, which upheld the Planning Commission's second approval.
February 9, 2022 Planning Commission Hearing.

12 58.

DP&F uoypiodiog mvy puotssafead y DICKENSON, PEATMAN & FOGARTY 13 In advance of the hearing, City Staff prepared a report recommending approval of

14 the Project to the Planning Commission. The report relied almost entirely on the previous Project

15 approval from nearly two-years prior, despite Staff's acknowledgment that "[i]f the [] draft
resolution is approved, this would effectively be a brand-new use permit and design review project
16 entitlement." City Staff expressly relied in its report on the resolution approved two-years prior to

17 "reduce repetition."

18 59. The Planning Commission relied almost entirely on Staff's
19 recommendations, which report and

20 per the above was based almost entirely on the February 26, 2020

21 approval. Virtually no new analysis was undertaken in the hearing despite receiving four public

22 letters of concern, including from Petitioner's lawyer; comments at the hearing from Petitioner's

23 lawyer expressing concern regarding the Project; heightened fire risk in light of major wildfires in

24 northern Napa County since the 2020 approval; the amendment of the SRA/VHFHSZ Fire

25 Regulations to apply to all VHFHSZs, including those in local responsibility areas; and the

26 Planning Commission consisting of two new members since the initial approval.

60.

27 Petitioner's comments focused on the fact that the private drive granting access to

28 the Cottages and Petitioner's property was governed by a private easement for residential
purposes, which does not include commercial access, and particularly not at the intensity proposed

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 15

AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

2 by the Project. Yet the Planning Commissioners and City Staff were dismissive of this issue,

4 expressly declining to even hear arguments related to the easement on the unsubstantiated grounds
that the scope of the easement and CC&Rs is a civil matter "between property owners" and not an

6 issue for the Planning Commission to "deal with". The thrust of Petitioner's arguments was/
therefore largely ignored, and on the remaining issues raised relating to the City's interpretation of
the B&B Code, the Planning Commission simply deferred to Staff's interpretation and largely
declined to engage on the merits.

9 approve the Project.

10 At conclusion of the February 9 hearing, the Planning Commission voted to

First Appeal.

11 62.

DP&F DICKENSON, PEATMAN & FOGARTY 12

A Professional Law Corporation 13 63. On February 20, 2022, Petitioner timely appealed that decision to the City Council.
Petitioner asserted several grounds for appeal.

14

15 Ground #1: The B&B use is not accessory/secondary to a primary residential use,
in violation of the City Zoning Ordinance.

16

17 a. The CMC clearly requires B&B use to be accessory to a primary residential use in
R-1-10 districts. CMC § 17.35.010(D) states:

18

19 "It is further the purpose of these regulations to provide for

20 bed and breakfast facilities which are accessory to and secondary to the primary residential use of land in

21 residentially zoned areas. The terms "accessory" and "*secondary" mean that the establishment of bed and breakfast

22 facilities in residential zones shall not exceed 49 percent of the use of the land and/or building area on and in which the
facilities are to be located."

23

24 (Emphasis added). In short, a B&B must be the owner/operator's residence, and

25 less than half of it may be used to serve guests. The plain language of the Code requires comparing land to land, or building area to building area to determine the

land) ratio.

26 ratio of uses. The 49% limitation does not limit the lot coverage (building-area to

27

28 b. Further, CMC § 17.04.023 defines "accessory use" as "a use that is incidental
and subordinate to a principal use on a
same site." (Emphasis added.) site and is customarily found on the

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 16

c. The Project has no existing residential use and proposes only a de minimis mixed-
use building as a guest reception and manager office/residence, the floor area of
w which comprises merely 2% of the total Parcel size. Thus, Petitioner alleged (and
maintains for the purposes of this writ) a violation of the CMC because
§ 17.35.010(D) requires the B&B use to be less than 49% of the use.

6 d. Further, the B&B use must be incidental and subordinate to a principal residentiall

7 use. Clearly, the primary use here is a commercial hotel use in violation of the
B&B Code, considering >90% of the structures on the property and essentially
all of the developed exterior access, parking, and open space serve to

10 accommodate and benefit paying guests and are intended primarily for commerciall

11 use.

AIHVDO4 A9 NVWIVEd 'NOSNIDICI 12 64. Ground #2: City violated B&B Code requirements of § 17.35.040(C) regarding
DP&F uOIDAOd109 MPT pouopssafosd V 13 maximum units.

14 a. Per the requirements discussed above, CMC § 17.35.040(C)(2) provides for a

15 maximum of two units or rooms for B&Bs in R-1-10 zones. Subsection (3) allows

16 for an increase to six units if six special circumstances can be met. Subsection (4)

17 allows for a maximum increase to 10 units if an additional four special

18 circumstances can be met.

19 b. City had previously only analyzed the exception under § 17.35.040(C)(4), and did

20 not analyze the exception under Subsection (C)(3) as required by law. See

21 Paragraph 40(g) above for the list of special circumstances. Although Respondent

22 performed this analysis in subsequent staff reports, their analysis is ultimately

23 flawed for several reasons. For example, CMC § 17.35.040(C)(3)(c) requires City

24 to consider the character of the proposed site relative to its surroundings. City's

25 rationale focuses largely on design elements of the Project instead of the morel

26 important issue that the Project, which will result in construction of essentially a

27 10-unit hotel, currently with no residential use - is blatantly out-of-character

28 compared to its surroundings. Further, Subsection D requires City to consider the

17
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- nature of ingress and egress, yet the City did not prepare any traffic study or

2 analysis, and similarly prepared no analysis of turning movements of cars backing

3 out of parking spaces into the shared private drive, nor an analysis of commerciall
4 vehicle deliveries and access, despite the intersection of the private drive and

5 Foothill Boulevard (State Highway 128) being heavily trafficked. City also

6 expressly declined to consider the scope of the private driveway easement and its

7 restrictions/limitations on commercial access, use, and intensity, the consideration

8 of which is crucial to and required by this special circumstance. It is also
o noteworthy and cause for concern, given increased fire risks and commercial
10 intensification of this residentially zoned property with no primary residential use,

11 that the Parcel proposes the maximum allowable B&B units under the Code.
12 65. Ground #3: Inappropriate Reliance on the CEQA Categorical Exemption.
DP&F uoppaod1og avj ppuopssaford y AIXVD0- A NVNIVEd DICKENSON, 13 a. See discussion above.

14 66. Ground #4: Failure to Inspect Facilities per CMC § 17.35.020(H).

15 a. CMC §17.35.020(H) states that all facilities shall be inspected on an annual basis

16 by the Planning and Building Department for conformance with use permit

17 conditions and the regulations established in this title, and inspection reports shall

18 be forwarded to the Planning Commission for informational purposes, as

19 necessary. Petitioner alleged (and still does) that such inspection prior to

20 approving was "necessary", and such inspection would determine the existing and

21 proposed uses do not comply with the B&B Code and the City's use permit

22 regulations.

23 67. Ultimately, the appeal requested that the City Council overturn the Planning

24 Commission's approval of the Project, or in the alternative, to remand the Project to the Planning

25 Commission for "full consideration and analysis of the issues raised as part of [the] appeal."

26 March 15, 2022 City Council Hearing and Remand.

27 68. An appeal hearing was held before the City Council on March 15, 2022. The

28 issues discussed above were raised during presentation by Petitioner, including an analysis of the

18
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- General Plan's inconsistencies with Project approval.

2 69. The City Council focused largely on CMC § 17.35.010(D)'s requirement that the

3 B&B use cannot be more than 49% of building area or land. In particular, Councilmember Donald

4 Williams noted his opposition to the Project, and expressed uncertainty surrounding whether the

5 B&B use on the Parcel is accessory to and secondary to a primary residential use on the property,

6 including questioning the City's methodology for calculating the B&B use as a ratio of lot size.

7 City Staff and the Planning Commission's position was to add the floor area of the 10 units

8 (totaling 6,110 sf) and divide that by the Parcel size (62,727 sf) for a B&B use of 9.74%. Yet the

9 City Council rightly raised concerns over this methodology, as City Staff's methodology entirely

10 from its calculation of B&B use, and in excluded access, parking, common areas, and open space

11 any event erroneously failed to compare residential to B&B use in violation of the plain text of the
AL8V9O4 A NVNIVAd 'NOSNIADICI 12 Code.

DP&F uoypaod.00 au1 ppuorssaford V 13 70. Thus, the City Council voted to remand the Project to the Planning Commission

14 for analysis of precedential decisions to determine the appropriate methodology, including

15 explaining why the City would exclude access, parking, common areas, and open space from its

16 calculation of B&B use, which serve almost entirely to accommodate paying guests.

17 April 27, 2022 Planning Commission Remand Hearing and Second Appeal.

18 71. On April 27, 2022, the remand hearing was held before the Planning Commission.

19 Regarding the CMC's accessory use requirements, City Staff offered two methodologies for
20 calculating use.

21 72. The first methodology ("Methodology 1") strictly measures the facility floor area

22 as a ratio of lot size. Under this interpretation, Respondent determined that while the residential

23 use was only 2% of land, the B&B use would be only 7%, because common areas, access, and

24 parking were entirely excluded from consideration as a B&B use:

uonvaod40 mp1 ppuoissafoad y 13 the commercial use, and the commercial use to be no more than 49% of the residential use.

74. The second methodology (*Methodology 2") measures secondary use by

26 Petitioner argued and maintains in this writ that both of these methodologies are so

27 unreasonable as to constitute an abuse of discretion, and that they are reverse-engineered
explanations of a plainly non-compliant project.

28 76. The B&B use of the Parcel is patently greater than 49% of the residential use. The

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 20

AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

-

2 City's attempts to rig the calculations to reach the desired result clearly illustrate that the primary

3 use of the Parcel is a commercial B&B use in violation of the B&B Code. The only arguable

4 proposed residential use on the a Parcel is a portion of a mixed-use commercial/residential manager
cottage - the remainder of the use is almost entirely commercial. The suggestion that guest access

6 and parking is not a commercial B&B use is unsupported by the evidence and belies common

7 sense; the treatment of the proposed mixed-use manager residence and guest reception area and its
surroundings as entirely Residential use is plainly wrong and indefensible.

77. Under Methodology 1, City arbitrarily excludes from its calculation common area

10 and circulation, access, parking, and open space, despite the fact these features exist almost

11 entirely to benefit paying guests. And even then, only 2% of the Parcel is admittedly residential,

DICKENSON PEaTman & FOGARTY 12 despite zoning ordinance requirements for the residential use to be the primary use.

78.

DP&F HOpDIOd100 M91 puoyssafosd V 13 Under Methodology 2, City includes the area directly surrounding the B&Bs, as it

14 should, but again excludes access, parking and open space. It also counts the entire manager

15 office/guest reception unit as residential despite being mixed residential and commercial use. Even

16 still, this methodology admittedly only considers 11% of the property to be a residential use under

17 this inflated calculation. And if access and parking were considered as a B&B use in this

18 methodology, as they should, the B&B use would be 58% of the Parcel, in clear violation of CMC
§ 17.35.010(D).

19 79.

20 In any event, comparing residential to B&B use under any methodology, as

21 required by the Code, would result in a blatant violation of law, as a comparison of residential to

22 commercial use clearly illustrates the commercial B&B use exceeds 49% and that the residential
use is relatively de minimis.

23

24 80. Petitioner/Appellant also noted in its presentation that the Project meets the

25 definition of a hotel under CMC § 17.04.360, pointing out Applicant's repeated blatant advertising

26 of the Cottages as a "hotel", and showing the Planning Commission pictures of four B&Bs in the
R-1-10 district which are all single-family, single-structure dwellings that repurposed somel
27 bedrooms to B&B uses:

11 81. By contrast, the proposed expanded Cottages is comprised of ten separate

DP&F AIQV9O4 A NVNIVEd 'NOSNEDICI 12 with no existing residential use. Proposing merely one mixed-use manager "residence" is a
uoupaod10) avj puossafold V 13 superficial attempt to satisfy the Code's provisions and would at most allow a residential use of

14 only 50% of that one structure.

15 82. Yet despite the requirement that the B&B use be "secondary" to a primary
16 residential use, and that admittedly the residential use of property constituted a maximum of 11%

17 use of the land under the City's most favorable methodology (Methodology 2), the Planning|

18 Commission voted to approve the Project 4-0. That approval was an abuse of discretion.

19 83. Therefore, Petitioner timely appealed the Planning Commission's approval on

20 remand to the City Council. Grounds for the appeal were (1) the hotel (or B&B) use was clearly

21 the primary use on the property and was not secondary to a residential use: (2) the City's
22 calculation of secondary use under the 49% rule was arbitrary and capricious; (3) the Project

23 would authorize construction of a hotel in a residential neighborhood; (4) the Project violates the

24 B&B Code's spacing requirements; and (5) the Parcel's proximity to the Chanric Inn implicates

25 CEQA's cumulative impacts categorical exception. (CEQA Guidelines § 15300.2(b).)

26 June 7, 2022 City Council Remand Appeal Hearing.

27 84. On June 7, 2022, City Council held a final hearing regarding Petitioner's appeal of

28 the Planning Commission's April 27 decision. The Staff Report and analysis largely carried over

23
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

from the Planning Commission remand hearing, but two new issues were discussed.

2 85. First, City Staff added a third methodology ("Methodology 3") to calculate B&B

3 a use as a percentage of land. This methodology arbitrarily excluded access and open space from its

4 calculation. This methodology was again engineered to achieve the desired result.

14

15 86. Through erroneously excluding access and open space, and counting only half of

16 the guest-used common and parking area, this methodology conveniently yielded a 47% B&B use

17 of the property, as well as a 13% residential use entirely based on the manager unit (despite, as

18 discussed above, a major use of this unit being commercial). Had it included even a portion of

19 access or properly allocated the mixed-use structure, Methodology 3 would have eclipsed the 49%
use limitation. In any event, that limitation was itself manufactured again, the code requires a 20

21 comparison of the residential to commercial use, not an absolute limit.

22 87. Second, Petitioner/Appellant argued that City violated the B&B Code's spacingl

23 § requirements. CMC § 17.35.040(c)(1) states that in R-1-10 zones, spacing requirements of B&B's

24 are "not more than one bed and breakfast facility per each side of a City block or one facility per

25 each 500 feet where conventional blocks are not present."

26 88. As discussed above, the Chanric Inn is located next door at 1805 Foothilll

27 Boulevard, adjacent to Applicant's Parcel.

28 89. City Staff's response was that the Cottages was legally nonconforming but made

24
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

-

2 legal via a prior use permit approval in 2015. The expansion was therefore allegedly permitted

3 under the City Code. However, City clearly misreads its own Code. The Rule is that "[a] structure

4 conforming as to use but nonconforming with respect to height, setback or coverage may bel

5 altered or extended if the alteration or extension does not further deviate from the standards of this

6 title." (CMC con 17.44.015(B) (Emphasis added).) By its terms, this Code section does not permit

7 expansion when spacing regulations are violated. "Spacing" requirements are distinct concepts

8 from height, setback or coverage requirements under the City's Code. Therefore, City Staff's
analysis is incorrect and the expansion is in violation of law due to the Cottages' proximity to the

10 Chanric Inn. The spacing requirement is not a "setback" per the CMC, and approval of the Project

11 despite this requirement is in violation of law.

DICKENSON, PEATMAN & FOGARTY 12

DP&F uonpaod1og Mvy ppuoissafosd V 90. Additionally, Petitioner raised the issue on appeal that CEQA categorical

13 exception Section 15300.2(b) - Cumulative Impacts - is implicated by the close proximity of the

14 Project and the Chanric Inn. That exception states: "[a]ll exemptions for these classes are

15 inapplicable when the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place,

16 over time is significant." In its analysis of this exception, City simply stated that the Project would

17 not implicate this exception because "the Site is already disturbed from previous development

18 activities and neighboring parcels are developed." Yet as discussed above, the Project has potential

19 to impact the environment due to is location in the VHFHSZ. Further, during the hearing,|

20 Councilmember Donald Williams noted that the intersection of Foothill Boulevard and the private

21 drive is heavily trafficked, and this expansion may result in additional unsafe traffic flow to an
already dangerous intersection, as well as unsafe conditions for pedestrians attempting to walk to
22 downtown. Yet the City did not address in its analysis of this exception Petitioner's arguments that

23

24 expanding this B&B in the VHFHSZ and in a heavily-trafficked location in close proximity to an

25 existing B&B, may result in significant cumulative impacts, and did not perform any traffic study
analyzing these impacts.

26

27 91. Despite the above, on Staff's recommendation, the City Council voted 4-0 to reject

28 Petitioner's appeal and approve the Project, and adopted the Resolution approving the Project on
June 7, 2022.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 25

1 92. On June 28, Respondent filed a Notice of Exemption with the State Clearinghouse

2 Office of Planning & Research finding that the Project was exempt from CEQA under the Class

3 Categorical Exemption.

4 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

5 (VIOLATION OF CEQA)

6 93. The Petitioner incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in the paragraphs

7 above.

8 94. CEQA requires the lead agency for a project with the potential to cause significant
9 environmental impacts to prepare an EIR that complies with the requirements of the statute,
10 including, but not limited to, the requirement to analyze the project's potentially significant
11 environmental impacts. The EIR must provide sufficient environmental analysis such that the
decision makers can intelligently consider environmental consequences when acting on the
DP&F 40140d109 MDT ppuOjssaforJ V AIHVDO  2 NVNIVId NOSNINDICI 12

13 proposed project.

14 95. In some instances, the lead agency need not prepare an EIR. One such instance

15 includes if the lead agency determines a categorical exemption to CEQA applies such that the

16 Project is exempt from CEQA analysis.

17 96. Whether a Project qualifies for a Categorical Exemption based on the language of

18 the CEQA Guidelines is question of law which is reviewed by Courts de novo. (Holden V. City of

19 San Diego (4th Dist. 2019) 43 Cal. App. 5th 404, 410.) Exemption categories are not to be

20 expanded or broadened beyond the reasonable scope of their statutory language. (Mountain Lion

21 Foundation v. Fish & Game Com. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 125.)

22 97. Further, lead agencies applying categorical exemptions to CEQA must confirm no

23 exceptions to those exemptions exist. One exception is unusual circumstances: "[a] categorical

24 exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity

25 will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances." (CEQA

26 Guidelines § 15300.2(c).) Courts use a two-prong test to determine if this exception applies: (1) is

27 there any substantial evidence that "unusual circumstances" apply to the Project; and (2) is there

28 fair argument "there is a reasonable possibility of a significant effect on the environment due to

26
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 unusual circumstances"? (Berkeley Hillside Pres. V. City of Berkeley (2015) 60 Cal. 4th 1086,

2 1114-15.)

3 98. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law and violated CEQA

4 by:

5 a. Finding the Class 3 Categorical Exemption applies in the first instance. As

6 discussed above, City erroneously expanded the plain language of the Guidelines

7 by reading the exemption to cover a parcel with ten structures, and considered

8 multiple structures regarding the 2,500 square foot limitation in § 15303(c).
.o Reading the categorical exemption to directly contradict the plain language of the
10 CEQA Guidelines is an impermissible broadening of this language in violation of
11 law.

AIXVOO, A9 NVNIVad NOSNIDICI 12 b. Finding that the cumulative impacts exception does not apply. CEQA Guidelines
DP&F uojwaodiog av puojssafoad v 13 15300.2(b) states that "[a]ll exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the
14 cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over

15 time is significant." As discussed above, the Chanric Inn is a B&B directly

16 adjacent to the Parcel. Respondent has failed to respond in the record to

17 Petitioner's claim that the significant expansion of a second B&B within 500 feet

18 of the Parcel implicates this exception, and claims simply that because the Parcell

19 has already been disturbed from previous development and because neighboring

20 parcels are developed, this exception does not apply. Yet as discussed above, the

21 Parcel is in located in a VHFSHZ and is located in heavily-trafficked residential

22 area of the City. Cumulative impacts from this expansion on the environment and

23 traffic will be significant.

24 C. Finding that the unusual circumstances exception does not apply. The Project is

25 located in a Very High Fire Severity Hazard Zone per CAL FIRE modeling and is

26 located at an urban-wildland interface in a residential community, with adjacent

27 heavily-wooded hillsides subject in part to an open space easement. In lieu of

28 increasing wildfire risk in recent years, there is a fair argument of a reasonable

27
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

0 N possibility that construction of four additional units on this parcel may

4 significantly impact the environment by increasing the property's already very

5 high fire risk. Indeed, two similar facilities in the County were severely damaged

6 99. or destroyed by wildfires between the Project's original 2020 consideration and the
2022 approval of the Project.

7

8 Respondents' failure to proceed as required by law and in the absence of
substantial evidence to support

9 their decision is an abuse of discretion.

10 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

11 (VIOLATION OF LOCAL LAW, THE CITY OF CALISTOGA GENERAL PLAN

100.

DICKENSON, PEATMAN & FOGARTY 12 AND MUNICIPAL CODE)

above.

DP&F A Professional Law Corporation 13 101. The Petitioner incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in the paragraphs

14

15 The general plan is the "constitution for all future developments" within a City and

16 "the propriety of virtually any local decision affecting land use and development depends upon

17 consistency with the applicable general plan and its elements." (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of

18 Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal. 3d 553, 570.) Further, (1) City's zoning code and its interpretations of

19 the code must be consistent with its General Plan and be reasonable (Families Unafraid to Uphold

20 Rural El Dorado County v. Bd. of Supervisors (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1336); and (2) City's
decision to approve

21 this project must be supported by substantial evidence based on the entire
record. (Id. at 1338.) Further, a City may not interpret their local laws in whatever manner they
desire where General Plan or Code provisions at issue are "fundamental, mandatory and
22 unambiguous." (Id. at 1332.)

23 102.

24

25 City has violated the consistency doctrine, taking actions inconsistent with its own
General Plan in the following ways:

a.

26

27 Applying the CEQA categorical exemption to evade analysis of environmental

28 impacts. This is inconsistent with the City's Land Use, Public Safety, and Circulation Elements.

i. Land Use Element. Objective LU 1.2 requires the City to promote a

balance between visitor-oriented

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE and

AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 28 local-serving commercial

2 development. P1.2-2 requires that new visitor accommodations proposed]

t "shall be required to mitigate all environmental impacts." (Emphasis

† added.) Objective LU 3.2 requires the City to ensure new development
complements Calistoga's small town character and "minimizes impacts on

6 the environment". (Emphasis added.) Despite these mandates, City
applied a categorical exemption to this Projectinvolving new visitor
accommodations-bypassing thorough consideration of potential
environmental impacts despite the Project's location in the VHFHSZ
within a residential zoning district.
10
11 ii. Public Safety Element. The Public Safety Element notes that Foothill

12 Boulevard is characterized by "steep, wooded slopes…within the Very|

DP&F DICKENSON PEatman & FOGARTY uONDIOd1Og MD] ¡puopssafo4d V 13 High Fire Hazard Severity Zone..." (SAF-17.) Further, Goal SAF-3 of that

14 Element is to "[p]rotect lives and property from wildland fire hazard."

15 Implementing this Goal in relevant part is Objective SAF-3.1: "[p]lan new

16 developments with wildland fire hazards in mind." Policy 1 further states

17 "[p]lans for development in the Very High Fire Hazard Area shall bel

18 reviewed for their incorporation of design measures to reduce wildland fire

19 risk." Thus, despite clear General Plan requirements to consider wildfire

20 hazards, particularly in the VHFHSZ, City simply deferred to the Fire

21 Department to ensure compliance with certain state and local fire

22 regulations in construction of the Project. City acted inconsistently with the

23 General Plan by applying the categorical exemption and by not following

24 the SRA/VHFHSZ Fire Safe Regulations which were recently updated in
response to heightened wildfire risk.

25

26 iii. Circulation Element. Objective 1.4 of the Circulation Element states:

27 "[t]he City shall create and maintain a comprehensive and integrated

28 transportation network that provides safe, comfortable and convenient
travel, serving all types of users." City acted inconsistently with this

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 29

AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

an aggressive expansion of visitor - requirement by approving

2 accommodations in an already busy and unsafe intersection, withoutl

3 preparing a thorough traffic analysis of the Project's impacts, particularly

4 given its close proximity to another B&B and without consideration of

5 potential cumulative impacts.

6 b. Approval of : hotel in a Low-Density residential district in violation of the City's

7 General Plan - Land Use Element. (LU-12.)

8 C. Further, several objectives, policies, and actions of the City's Land Use Element
require the City to ensure commercial development is consistent with adjacent uses

10 (in particular lower-intensity uses), to promote a balance between visitor-oriented

11 and local-serving development, and to ensure commercial development does not

12 disturb Calistoga's quality of life and small-town character, including specifically
DP&F uopwaodi0g avl pouojssaoad V Al8VOOA 2 NVNLVAd'NOSNIXDICI 13 with respect to B&Bs. (See Objective LU 1.2 ("[p]romote a balance between

14 visitor-oriented and local-serving commercial development"), Policy P1.2-2

15 ("[n]ew visitor accommodations proposed in Calistoga shall be required to

16 environmental impacts"); Policy P1.2-4 ("[n]ew visitor mitigate all

17 accommodations development shall be designed, constructed and operated sO

18 as to be compatible with adjacent uses, particularly residences"), Action A1.2-

19 - ("[c]ontinue to regulate the expansion of bed-and-breakfast units to ensure an

20 appropriate mix of land uses and to retain the predominantly residential

21 character of established neighborhoods"); Objective LU 1.3 ("[e]nsure that

22 commercial and industrial development is designed, located and operated so as to

23 not disturb Calistoga's quality of life, and approved at a rate and scale that

24 retains Calistoga's small-town character"); Objective LU 3.1 ("[p]revent

25 development from occurring where the location or the physical or biological

26 characteristics of the site would make the land use inappropriate"); Policy 3.1-2

27 (*[n]ew development shall be designed so as to not adversely impact adjacent uses,

28 [in] particular those of lower intensities"); Policy 3.2-1 ("[n]ew development

30
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1

2 shall be designed to respect and enhance Calistoga's small-town rural characterl
and the natural environment") (Emphasis added).)

3 103. Approval of this hotel, or in the alternative B&B with maximum units allowable

4 by law and no pre-existing residential use, is clearly prioritizing over-intensification of

5 commercial visitor-oriented development project over the residential character of the surrounding

6 neighborhood, with minimal regard to adjacent lower-intensity residential uses or Calistoga's

7 small-town character.

8 104. In addition to inconsistencies with the General Plan, City's interpretation of its

9 zoning code is unreasonable and clearly in violation of law in the following ways:

10 a. Approval of a Project with an "accessory" B&B use in a residential zoning district

11

12 with no primary residential use in violation of CMC §§ 17.35.010(D) and
ALAVDO  A NVNLVEd 'NOSNINDICI A Professional Law Corporation 17.04.023, for the reasons discussed above;
DP&F 13
14 b. Adoption of a percentage use methodology contrary to the plain language of CMC

15 § 17.35.010(D) requiring comparison of the residential use to the commercial use,

16 not comparison of the commercial use to the property as a whole;

C.

17 Unreasonable and arbitrary calculation of B&B use under CMC § 17.35.010(D),

18 per the three methodologies offered by City Staff, for the reasons discussed above;

19 d. Violation of B&B spacing requirements under CMC § 17.35.040(c)(1). For the

20 reasons discussed above, Respondent's argument that Cottages can be expanded

21 despite violating spacing requirements is unreasonable because spacingl

22 requirements are distinct from height, setback, and coverage, which are distinct
concepts under the CMC;

23 e.

24 Violation of B&B requirements for findings required to approve maximum units
per CMC §§ 17.35.040(C) et. seq.;

25

26 f. Violation of requirements for use permit approvals per CMC §§ 17.40.030(D)(1)-
(3); and

27 g.

28 Failure to inspect facilities and forward reports to the Planning Commission before
approval in violation of CMC § 17.35.020(H).

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 31

AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 105. City also violated law when it failed to consider as part of the renewal hearings

2 issues related to the scope of the private driveway easement and CC&Rs. City failed to consider

3

4 whether undertaking the proposed project could be accomplished legally. Further the Project
implicates issues of commercial and emergency access, traffic, public safety, and commercial use

5 of the easement, which is relevant to, among other issues, the special circumstances required to

6 approve the maximum of ten units under the B&B Code.

7 106.

8 Respondents' failure to proceed as required by law and in the absence of
substantial evidence to support their decision is an abuse of discretion.

9 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

10 (VIOLATION OF SRA/VHFHSZ FIRE SAFE REGULATIONS)

11 107.

above. The Petitioner incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in the paragraphs

DP&F DICKENSON, PEATMAN & FOGARTY 12

noppaod40g AvT jouojss3[o4d V 13 108.

14 City violated the SRA/VHFHSZ Fire Safe Regulations by failing to notify the

15 Director of CAL FIRE of the Project which is located within the VHFHSZ, and by failing to

16 incorporate the applicable section of the SRA/VHFHSZ Fire Safe Regulations into the conditions|

17 of approval of the Project, as required by Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 §§ 1270.03(a) and (c)
respectively.

18 109.

19 City was advised of and had actual knowledge of the property's location in the
VHFHSZ prior to approval, but failed to abide by the applicable regulations.

INTRODUCTION
22
1. 23 This action seeks to halt the illegal expansion of a hotel in a residentiall

24 neighborhood. In its zeal to increase tax revenues to the City of Calistoga, its City Council and

25 Planning Commission (collectively, "City" or "Respondent"), ignored or violated numerous State

26 and local legal requirements.

2. 27 As set forth below, the City failed to follow its own zoning code by mislabeling

28 the hotel as a "Bed and Breakfast" ("B&B"), disregarded or manipulated the zoning requirements

-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 for B&Bs, failed to analyze the impacts of the hotel on the environment and neighbors, and

2 ignored unambiguous State requirements for projects in the Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone

3 (*VHFHSZ").

4 3. The City's actions are an abuse of discretion as it has not proceeded in the mannerl

5 provided by law, the decision is not supported by the findings, and the findings are not supported

6 by the evidence.

7 4. Michael P. Glover and Curtis J. Wilhelm (collectively "Petitioner") reside

8 immediately adjacent to the hotel. They hereby seek review and reversal of the decision of the

9 City's approval of the expansion of the Aurora Park Cottages hotel.

10 5. The expansion was initially approved on February 26, 2020, but that approval

11 expired. The plans called for expansion of an existing nominal B&B to (1) construct four
ALaVDOA A NVNIVEd 'NOSNINDICI 12 additional one-bedroom cottages; (2) construct six additional parking spaces and reconfigure one

14 manager's unit; and (4) new landscaping at and around the cottages. The parcel is 1.44 acres and is

15 located at 1807 Foothill Boulevard, Calistoga, California, 94515 (APN 011-290-051-000) (the

16 "Parcel").

17 6. The Project was never implemented before its expiration. Following the 20201

18 wildfires, and the updates to the State Responsibility Area ("SRA/VHFHSZ") Fire Safel

19 Regulations, the Project was revived on February 9. 2022 without any meaningful analysis, and

20 the City's Planning Commission ("Planning Commission") approved Renewal of Use Permit

21 2022-1 and Design Review 2022-1 (the "Project").

22 7. As discussed in detail below, Petitioner repeatedly opposed the Project. The

23 Planning Commission approved Applicant David Patel and 1807 Foothill, LLC d/b/a Aurora Park

24 Cottages' renewal of the Project over Petitioner's objection, which Petitioner timely appealed to

25 the City of Calistoga City Council ("City Council"'). On appeal, the City Council remanded the
26 Project for further consideration to the Planning Commission. The Project was again approved by

27 the Planning Commission on April 27, 2022.

28 8. Petitioner timely appealed this decision on remand to the City Council, which

2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

thereafter voted to deny the appeal and effectively uphold the Planning Commission's approval

2 on June 7, 2022, adopting Resolution No. 2022-042 (the "Resolution").

9. On June 28, 2022, Respondent filed a Notice of Exemption with the State Officel

4 of Planning and Research finding the Project categorically exempt from the requirements of the

5 California Environmental Quality Act (*CEQA"). This action is timely filed within 35 days of that

6 notice.

7 10. In approving the Project, Respondent failed to comply with CEQA, the
8 SRA/VHFHSZ Fire Safe Regulations, and several elements and sections of the City's General

9 Plan and Municipal Code, respectively.

10 11. Respondent approved the Project in violation of law by inappropriately relying on

11 CEQA Guidelines § 15303 - New Construction or Conversion of Small Structures (Class 3)

DP&F ALaVDOJ A NVNlVad'NOSNIXDICI 12 effectively bypassing review of the Project's potentially significant environmental impacts.
uonvaod102 Mv1 puoissafoad V 13 Respondent relied on this categorical exemption despite the Project failing to meet the plain text of

14 the Guidelines' requirements under §§ 15303 et. seq. It also erroneously concluded the

15 §§ 15300.2(b) and (c) exceptions to the categorical exemption for cumulative impacts and unusual

16 circumstances did not otherwise apply, despite there being a reasonable possibility that the Project

17 will have a significant impact on the environment given the Project's residential location in a Very

18 High Fire Hazard Severity Zone ("VHFHSZ").

19 12. Further, Respondent approved the Project in violation of its own General Plan and
20 numerous provisions of the City of Calistoga Municipal Code (*CMC"). Respondent's

21 interpretation of the City's General Plan is clearly inconsistent with its interpretation of its Zoning

22 Code, and its interpretation of several of its Zoning Code provisions is unreasonable and

23 unsupported by the evidence.

24 13. Respondent also approved the Project in violation of SRA/VHFHSZ Fire Safe

25 Regulations, Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 1270 et seq., including Sections 1270.03(a) and (c). Given

26 these failures, Respondent approved the Project in violation of law.

27 14. The Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court vacate and set aside the denial

28 of the appeal and approval of the Project and order Respondent to comply with CEQA, its own

20 25. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

21 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondent to set aside approval

22 of the Project. In the absence of such remedies, Respondent's approval will remain in effect in

23 violation of state law.

24 BACKGROUND

25 Existing Conditions.

26 26. Applicant owns and operates on Parcel a commercial lodging facility known as the

a 27 Aurora Park Cottages (the "Cottages"). Applicant describes the Cottages on its own website as

28 "hotel." (See Aurora Park Cottages Website, available at www.aurorapark.com/explore).

5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 27. There are seven cottages available as guest accommodations, housed in separate
and 2 structures. The seven units are made up of six, 363 square-foot ("sf') one-bedroom cottages

3 one 871 sf two-bedroom cottage with a kitchen. Because the Cottages has more than six units, it

4 meets the City's definition of a "hotel". (CMC § 17.04.360.)

5 28. The Cottages are located at 1807 Foothill Boulevard (State Highway 128),

6 approximately one-half mile north of the intersection of State Highways 128 & 29 and Lincoln

7 Avenue in Calistoga, on the west side of the street.

8 29. The Parcel and Petitioner's property are located within the Brannan Ridge Estates

9 Subdivision ("Subdivision"). The Subdivision was approved in a recorded 1998 Parcel Map

10 (*Parcel Map"), and is further subject to Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions ("CC&Rs")

11 which were recorded with Napa County that same year.

ALXVDO  2 NVNIVEd 'NOSNINDICI 12 30. Guest and manager access to the cottages is only via a private drive a located off of
DP&F MOJWA0d409 MD7 (DHOjSS2JO4d V 13 Foothill Boulevard. The private drive serves the entire Subdivision, which includes several single-

14 family residences and the Cottages. Per the CC&Rs and Parcel Map, access via the private drive is

15 governed by a "private" driveway, drainage and utility easement for the benefit of all parcels in the

16 Subdivision. The Subdivision is also subject to an open space easement, which restricts

17 development of a substantial amount of acreage across the Subdivision's parcels.

18 31. The Cottages have already established eight parking spaces along the private drive.

19 Per the above, Petitioner shares an access easement over this private drive with the Applicant, and
20 all access and parking to the Project is off of this shared driveway.

21 32. The common area and space directly surrounding the cottages is wholly occupied

22 by walkways and landscaping which is purely designed to serve B&B guests. Below is a picture a

15 Proposed Project.

16 34. The Project proposes (1) construction of four additional 600-sf one-bedroom

17 cottages; (2) construction of six additional parking spaces and reconfiguration of one existing;

18 (3) conversion of the existing two-bedroom guest cottage to a front office reception area and

19 manager's unit, including 661-sf addition for a new total of 1,532 sf; and (4) new landscaping at

20 and around the cottages.
to a mixed-use 21 35. Given the existing two-bedroom guest cottage will be converted
guest reception, office, and manager residence, the Project will result in a total of ten guest units, 22

23 as well as fourteen parking spaces.

24 General Plan Designation and Zoning Regulations.

25 36. The Parcel is designated Low-Density Residential under the City's General Plan

26 and is zoned R-1-10: One-Family Zoning District (*R-1-10"). The purpose of this Designation and

27 Zoning is to allow the development of single-family and special needs residential uses that are

28 consistent with the Calistoga General Plan and State law, in a manner that provides generous

2 37. General Plan. Together with compatible accessory uses, the Low-Density

3 Residential Designation permits "schools, bed-and-breakfast inns; home occupations; and religious

4 facilities". "if they conform to all relevant General Plan policies[.]" (Land Use Element ("LU"),
LU-11.) In addition to the above, the following General Plan objectives, policies, and actions from

6 the Land Use Element are relevant.
a. Hotels are permitted for development in the Community Commercial Land Usel
Designation, not Low-Density Residential. (LU-11-12.)
O b. Objective LU 1.2: "[p]romote a balance between visitor-oriented and local-

39. The Circulation Element states:

10 a. Objective CIR-1.4: "[t]he City shall create and maintain a comprehensive and
11 integrated transportation network that provides safe, comfortable and convenient

AlHVDOH A NYNIVEd 'NOSNINDICI 12 travel, serving all types of users.3
DP&F voymaod109 M1 ppuojssaford V 13 40. Zoning.

14 a. Given its R-1-10 zoning, Foothill Boulevard consists of primarily single-family

15 residences. There is an existing B&B, the Chanric Inn. located directly south of the

16 Cottages at 1805 Foothill Boulevard. The Chanric Inn was formerly a single-

17 family dwelling that was converted to a B&B, with all units contained in one

18 residential structure. Other B&Bs in the zoning district are similarly single-family

19 dwellings with bedrooms converted to B&B units, unlike the Project which is

20 proposed to be ten stand-alone units, more similar to a hotel resort.

21 b. The Project meets the City's definition of a hotel under the CMC § 17.04.360 (*a

22 facility of six or more units located in a single structure or individual structures,

23 which may be connected by corridors or outdoor pedestrian walkways. The facility

24 shall have the primary purpose of providing transient lodging accommodations, as

25 contemplated by Chapter 3.16 CMC, to the general public.").

26 c. CMC § 17.04.023 states ''[a]ccessory use' shall mean a use that is incidental and

27 subordinate to a principal use on a site and is customarily found on the same

28 site." (Emphasis added.)

9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

2 d. Further, the City regulates B&Bs under CMC Chapter 17.35 (the "B&B Code").
The B&B Code regulates, inter alia, (1) primary & accessory use restrictions in R-

3 1-10 districts, (2) spacing requirements, and (3) maximum number of units.

4 e. B&Bs are defined as "the rental of rooms or space for the purpose of providing

5 overnight accommodations for paying guests for a period not to exceed 30 days

6 per individual rental, with not more than one meal to be provided daily, and with

7

8 the entire service offered to be included in one stated price." (CMC § 17.04.085.)

f. The B&B Code requires B&B uses to be accessory to a primary residential use on
parcels in R-1-10 districts. CMC § 17.35.010(D) states:
10
11 "It is further the purpose of these regulations to provide for bed and breakfast facilities which are accessory to and secondary to the primary residential use of land in residentially zoned areas. The

uonDIOd109 M71 ppuojssafoad V DICKENSON, PEATMAN & FOGARTY 12 terms "accessory" and "secondary" mean that the establishment of
DP&F 13 bed and breakfast facilities in residential zones shall not exceed 49

14 percent of the use of the land and/or building area on and in which
the facilities are to be located."

15 (Emphasis added.)

16 g. The B&B Code's requirements regarding maximum units are set out in CMC §S

17 17.35.040(C) et. seq.

18 i. In R-1-10 zones, a maximum of two units are allowed. (CMC c0

19 17.35.040(C)(2)(a).)

20 ii. The maximum number of B&B units may be increased to six, subject to a

21 major use permit, if the following special circumstances exist: (a)

22 proximity to a state highway; (b) historical character and/or significance of

23 structures; (c) character of proposed site relative to its surroundings; (d)

24 nature of ingress and egress; (e) adequacy of number and location of off-

25 street parking spaces and maneuvering areas; and (f) provision of roomsl

26 accessible to developmentally disabled. (CMC §§ 17.35.040(C)(3)(a)-(f).)

27 iii. Further, a limited exception allowing an increase to ten units (but no more)

28 can be met if in addition to the above special circumstances, the following

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 10

AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

are also met: (a) a B&B was authorized on

2 property before January 1,
2010; (b) the property is in an R-1-10 zone; (c) the property has

4 maximum of 10 units; and (d) there is a minimum lot size of 10,000 sf.
(CMC §§ 17.35.040(C)(4)(a)-(d).)

5 h. CMC §17.35.020(H) states that "[a]ll facilities shall be inspected on an annual

6 basis by the Planning and Building Department for conformance with use permit

7 conditions and the regulations established in this title. Inspection reports shall be

8 forwarded to the Planning Commission for informational purposes, as
necessary." (Emphasis added).

10 i

11 Further, all B&Bs require a use permit. (CMC § 17.35.030.) In conditionally

DP&F AIXVDOH AU NVNIVIJ NOSNINDICI 12 approving a use permit application, the CMC requires the local agency to find that

A Professional Law Corporation 13 the Project is, among others, (1) "in accord with the General Plan and any

14 applicable planned development"; (2) "[i]s in accord with all applicable provisions

15 of this title"; and (3) "[w]ill not substantially impair or interfere with the

16 development, use or enjoyment of other property in the vicinity." (CMC §

17.40.030(D)(1)-(3).)

17

18 Project area is designated Very High Fire Hazard Severity by CAL FIRE.

41.
19 The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection ("CAL FIRE")

20 classifies the severity of fire hazards in areas of California. Lands are either ranked Moderate,

21 High, or Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones. (CAL FIRE Website, available at

22 https://osfm.fire.ca.gov/divisions/community-wildfire-preparedness-and-mitigation/wildfire-

23 preparedness/fire-hazard-severity-zones/.) These classifications are determined by a science-based

24 and field-tested model which assigns a fire hazard score based on factors such as fire history,

25 existing and potential fuel, predicted flame length, blowing embers, terrain, and typical fire

weather for the area.
26 42.
27 The Parcel is located in the highest fire hazard category, Very High Fire Hazard

28 Severity Zone, at an urban-wildland interface between residential neighborhoods and the City. The

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 11

AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

2 adjacent hillsides are heavily wooded, and the Subdivision is covered in part by an open space
easement that preserves large swaths of the woodlands in the Subdivision.
43. In response to severe wildfire dangers and risks to the urban-wildland interface

4 from recent wildfires throughout the State, CAL FIRE amended, through rulemaking effective July

6 1, 2021, the State Responsibility Area Fire Safe Regulations to apply to the Very High Fire Hazard
Severity Zone, and renominated the SRA/VHFHSZ Fire Safe Regulations, Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14
§§ 1270.00 et seq. This rule change occurred between the City's approval of the Project prior to its
expiration and the subsequent renewal of the Project, and was applicable to the City's
consideration of the Project applied for in 2022.

10 44.

11 Sections 1270.03(a)-(c) of the SRA/VHFHSZ Fire Safe Regulations provide:

"(a)
AIAVDO  2g NVNIVEd NOSNINDIC 12 local jurisdictions shall provide the Director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection or their

DP&F A Professional Law Corporation 13 designee with notice of applications for building permits,

14 tentative parcel maps, tentative maps, and installation or use permits for construction or development within the SRA or,

(b) after July 1, 2021, the VHFHSZ;
15 the Director or their designee may review and make fire

16 protection recommendations on applicable construction or

(c) development permits or maps provided by the local jurisdiction;

17 the local jurisdiction shall ensure that the applicable sections of

18 this subchapter become a condition of approval of any
applicable construction or development permit or map."

19 (Emphasis added.)

20 45. The City was obligated to comply with the SRA/VHFHSZ Fire Safe Regulations

21 in consideration of the project, including Sections 1270.03(a) and (c) thereof, but based on the

22 record did not do so.

23 CEQA Categorical Exemption.

24 46. The Project is a "project" for the purposes of CEQA. Respondent determined that

25 the Project is Categorically Exempt from CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines § 15303 - New

26 Construction or Conversion of Small Structures (Class 3). This purpose of this exemption is to

27 exempt from CEQA's provisions the construction of limited, small facilities:

28 "Class 3 consists of construction and location of limited numbers of new, small

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 12

AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- facilities or structures; installation of small new equipment and facilities in small

2 structures; and the conversion of existing small structures from one use to another where only minor modifications are made in the exterior of the structure. The numbers of structures described in this Section are the maximum allowable
on any legal parcel. Examples of this exemption include but are not limited to:...

4

5 (b) A duplex or similar multi-family residential structure totaling no more than four dwelling units. In urbanized areas, this exemption applies to

6 apartments, duplexes, and similar structures designed for not more than six
dwelling units.

7 (c) A store, motel, office, restaurant or similar structure not involving the use of significant amounts of hazardous substances, and not exceeding 2,500 square feet in floor area. In urbanized areas, the

o exemption also applies to up to four such commercial buildings not exceeding 10,000 square feet in floor area on sites zoned for such use if

10 not involving the use of significant amounts of hazardous substances where all necessary public services and facilities are available and the

11 surrounding area is not environmentally sensitive..."

DICKENSON, PEATMAN & FOGARTY 12 (Emphasis added.)
47.
DP&F 101a0dI03 MD] ¡uoissaford y 13 Per the plain language of the above Guidelines, this exemption only allows for use

14 on a legal parcel of up to a four dwelling units in a non-urban area and not more than six dwelling|

15 units in an urban area. Further, the 2,500 square foot limitation is applicable to a single

16 commercial structure. (The Cottages are not in an urbanized area, and the 10,000-sf limit for four

17 structures is inapplicable.)

48.
18 City erroneously relied on this exemption by considering only the four additionall

19 structures to be built as part of the Project. However, the Project actually consists of five structures

20 four new cottages and significant construction to and expansion of a fifth and ignores that ten

21 total structures would exist on the Parcel after construction.

49.
22 City also mistakenly considered the four new structures together to be below the

23 2,500-sf limitation when Subsection C, by its own terms, only applies to one structure. Thus City

24 relied on this exemption in violation of the plain language of §§ 15303(b)-(c).

50.
25 Further, even if the Project qualified 3 for the Class 3 exemption (which it does not),

26 Respondent must confirm no categorical exceptions apply, including, inter alia, whether

27 cumulative impacts of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time, are

28 significant (CEQA Guidelines § 15300.2(b)), and whether unusual circumstances exist that could

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 13

AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

result in a significant impact on the environment. (CEQA Guidelines § 15300.2(c).)

2 51. As stated above, the Parcel is located in a Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone,

3 and upon completion will reach the B&B's absolute maximum of ten units in a low-density

4 residential neighborhood. Such a large commercial lodging facility--hotel or B&Bin a heavily

5 wooded urban-wildland interface covered in part by open space easements, and with the highest

6 fire risk designated by CAL FIRE. implicates unusual circumstances distinguishing the Project

7 from other categorically exempt projects.

8 52. Given very high fire risk generally in recent years, including nearby the project,

9 and subsequent updating of the SRA/VHFHSZ Fire Safe Regulations due to this increasing risk,

10 City should have at the very least prepared an initial study to determine potential environmental

11 impacts. Yet City claims that there is "no evidence" in the record that there is any reasonable
AIQVOO! A NVNIVAd NOSNINDIC 12 possibility that the Project will have a significant effect on the environment.
DP&F H0jDAOd409 MDT pu0jss2{04d V 13 53. Further, although the Chanric Inn B&B is located within 500 feet of the Parcel,

14 Respondent did not consider the significant expansion resulting from the Project may result in

15 significant cumulative impacts on the environment, traffic, and public safety despite the adjacent

16 proximity of these B&Bs.

17 PROCEDURAL HISTORY

18 Initial Project Approval and Expiration.

19 54. In 2018, Real Party in Interest initially applied for approval of the expansion of the

20 Cottages (Use Permit application 2018-12 and Design Review application 2018-9). The Planning

21 Commission approved those applications on February 26, 2020 - before the 2020 LNU Complex

22 and Glass Fires.

23 55. Condition of Approval 3 provided that the approval "shall be null and void if not

24 used within a one-year period," and that the Planning & Building Director may extend that time by

25 up to 12 months. The Project was approved on the grounds that it is allegedly consistent with the

28 56. Development on the Project was delayed. Thus, in December 2020, City Staff

AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

granted a one-year

2 extension of the use permit and design review applications. However, with the
entitlements due to expire in March 2022, and Applicant aware that the Project could not be

4 undertaken within the extension period, Applicant requested renewal of its applications in early

2022.

57.

6 Applicant's renewal of the Project resulted in four hearings: (1) the February 9,

7 2022 Planning Commission hearing approving the Project; (2) the March 15, 2022 City Council

8 hearing on Petitioner's appeal of the February 9 approval, which remanded the Project to the

9 Planning Commission; (3) the April 27, 2022 Planning Commission remand hearing which again

10 approved the Project; and (4) the June 7. 2022 City Council hearing of Petitioner/Appellant's

11 further appeal following the remand, which upheld the Planning Commission's second approval.
February 9, 2022 Planning Commission Hearing.

12 58.

DP&F uoypiodiog mvy puotssafead y DICKENSON, PEATMAN & FOGARTY 13 In advance of the hearing, City Staff prepared a report recommending approval of

14 the Project to the Planning Commission. The report relied almost entirely on the previous Project

15 approval from nearly two-years prior, despite Staff's acknowledgment that "[i]f the [] draft
resolution is approved, this would effectively be a brand-new use permit and design review project
16 entitlement." City Staff expressly relied in its report on the resolution approved two-years prior to

17 "reduce repetition."

18 59. The Planning Commission relied almost entirely on Staff's
19 recommendations, which report and

20 per the above was based almost entirely on the February 26, 2020

21 approval. Virtually no new analysis was undertaken in the hearing despite receiving four public

22 letters of concern, including from Petitioner's lawyer; comments at the hearing from Petitioner's

23 lawyer expressing concern regarding the Project; heightened fire risk in light of major wildfires in

24 northern Napa County since the 2020 approval; the amendment of the SRA/VHFHSZ Fire

25 Regulations to apply to all VHFHSZs, including those in local responsibility areas; and the

26 Planning Commission consisting of two new members since the initial approval.

60.

27 Petitioner's comments focused on the fact that the private drive granting access to

28 the Cottages and Petitioner's property was governed by a private easement for residential
purposes, which does not include commercial access, and particularly not at the intensity proposed

AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

2 by the Project. Yet the Planning Commissioners and City Staff were dismissive of this issue,

4 expressly declining to even hear arguments related to the easement on the unsubstantiated grounds
that the scope of the easement and CC&Rs is a civil matter "between property owners" and not an

6 issue for the Planning Commission to "deal with". The thrust of Petitioner's arguments was/
therefore largely ignored, and on the remaining issues raised relating to the City's interpretation of
the B&B Code, the Planning Commission simply deferred to Staff's interpretation and largely
declined to engage on the merits.

10 At conclusion of the February 9 hearing, the Planning Commission voted to

First Appeal.

11 62.

DP&F DICKENSON, PEATMAN & FOGARTY 12

A Professional Law Corporation 13 63. On February 20, 2022, Petitioner timely appealed that decision to the City Council.
Petitioner asserted several grounds for appeal.

14

15 Ground #1: The B&B use is not accessory/secondary to a primary residential use,
in violation of the City Zoning Ordinance.

16

17 a. The CMC clearly requires B&B use to be accessory to a primary residential use in
R-1-10 districts. CMC § 17.35.010(D) states:

18

19 "It is further the purpose of these regulations to provide for

20 bed and breakfast facilities which are accessory to and secondary to the primary residential use of land in

21 residentially zoned areas. The terms "accessory" and "*secondary" mean that the establishment of bed and breakfast

22 facilities in residential zones shall not exceed 49 percent of the use of the land and/or building area on and in which the
facilities are to be located."

23

24 (Emphasis added). In short, a B&B must be the owner/operator's residence, and

25 less than half of it may be used to serve guests. The plain language of the Code requires comparing land to land, or building area to building area to determine the

land) ratio.

26 ratio of uses. The 49% limitation does not limit the lot coverage (building-area to

28 b. Further, CMC § 17.04.023 defines "accessory use" as "a use that is incidental
and subordinate to a principal use on a
same site." (Emphasis added.) site and is customarily found on the

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 16

c. The Project has no existing residential use and proposes only a de minimis mixed-
use building as a guest reception and manager office/residence, the floor area of
w which comprises merely 2% of the total Parcel size. Thus, Petitioner alleged (and
maintains for the purposes of this writ) a violation of the CMC because
§ 17.35.010(D) requires the B&B use to be less than 49% of the use.

6 d. Further, the B&B use must be incidental and subordinate to a principal residentiall

7 use. Clearly, the primary use here is a commercial hotel use in violation of the
B&B Code, considering >90% of the structures on the property and essentially
all of the developed exterior access, parking, and open space serve to

10 accommodate and benefit paying guests and are intended primarily for commerciall

11 use.

AIHVDO4 A9 NVWIVEd 'NOSNIDICI 12 64. Ground #2: City violated B&B Code requirements of § 17.35.040(C) regarding
DP&F uOIDAOd109 MPT pouopssafosd V 13 maximum units.

14 a. Per the requirements discussed above, CMC § 17.35.040(C)(2) provides for a

15 maximum of two units or rooms for B&Bs in R-1-10 zones. Subsection (3) allows

16 for an increase to six units if six special circumstances can be met. Subsection (4)

17 allows for a maximum increase to 10 units if an additional four special

18 circumstances can be met.

19 b. City had previously only analyzed the exception under § 17.35.040(C)(4), and did

20 not analyze the exception under Subsection (C)(3) as required by law. See

21 Paragraph 40(g) above for the list of special circumstances. Although Respondent

22 performed this analysis in subsequent staff reports, their analysis is ultimately

23 flawed for several reasons. For example, CMC § 17.35.040(C)(3)(c) requires City

24 to consider the character of the proposed site relative to its surroundings. City's

25 rationale focuses largely on design elements of the Project instead of the morel

26 important issue that the Project, which will result in construction of essentially a

27 10-unit hotel, currently with no residential use - is blatantly out-of-character

28 compared to its surroundings. Further, Subsection D requires City to consider the

17
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- nature of ingress and egress, yet the City did not prepare any traffic study or

2 analysis, and similarly prepared no analysis of turning movements of cars backing

3 out of parking spaces into the shared private drive, nor an analysis of commerciall
4 vehicle deliveries and access, despite the intersection of the private drive and

5 Foothill Boulevard (State Highway 128) being heavily trafficked. City also

6 expressly declined to consider the scope of the private driveway easement and its

7 restrictions/limitations on commercial access, use, and intensity, the consideration

8 of which is crucial to and required by this special circumstance. It is also
o noteworthy and cause for concern, given increased fire risks and commercial
10 intensification of this residentially zoned property with no primary residential use,

11 that the Parcel proposes the maximum allowable B&B units under the Code.
12 65. Ground #3: Inappropriate Reliance on the CEQA Categorical Exemption.
DP&F uoppaod1og avj ppuopssaford y AIXVD0- A NVNIVEd DICKENSON, 13 a. See discussion above.

14 66. Ground #4: Failure to Inspect Facilities per CMC § 17.35.020(H).

15 a. CMC §17.35.020(H) states that all facilities shall be inspected on an annual basis

16 by the Planning and Building Department for conformance with use permit

17 conditions and the regulations established in this title, and inspection reports shall

18 be forwarded to the Planning Commission for informational purposes, as

19 necessary. Petitioner alleged (and still does) that such inspection prior to

20 approving was "necessary", and such inspection would determine the existing and

21 proposed uses do not comply with the B&B Code and the City's use permit

22 regulations.

23 67. Ultimately, the appeal requested that the City Council overturn the Planning

24 Commission's approval of the Project, or in the alternative, to remand the Project to the Planning

25 Commission for "full consideration and analysis of the issues raised as part of [the] appeal."

26 March 15, 2022 City Council Hearing and Remand.

27 68. An appeal hearing was held before the City Council on March 15, 2022. The

28 issues discussed above were raised during presentation by Petitioner, including an analysis of the

18
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- General Plan's inconsistencies with Project approval.

2 69. The City Council focused largely on CMC § 17.35.010(D)'s requirement that the

3 B&B use cannot be more than 49% of building area or land. In particular, Councilmember Donald

4 Williams noted his opposition to the Project, and expressed uncertainty surrounding whether the

5 B&B use on the Parcel is accessory to and secondary to a primary residential use on the property,

6 including questioning the City's methodology for calculating the B&B use as a ratio of lot size.

7 City Staff and the Planning Commission's position was to add the floor area of the 10 units

8 (totaling 6,110 sf) and divide that by the Parcel size (62,727 sf) for a B&B use of 9.74%. Yet the

9 City Council rightly raised concerns over this methodology, as City Staff's methodology entirely

10 from its calculation of B&B use, and in excluded access, parking, common areas, and open space

11 any event erroneously failed to compare residential to B&B use in violation of the plain text of the
AL8V9O4 A NVNIVAd 'NOSNIADICI 12 Code.

DP&F uoypaod.00 au1 ppuorssaford V 13 70. Thus, the City Council voted to remand the Project to the Planning Commission

14 for analysis of precedential decisions to determine the appropriate methodology, including

15 explaining why the City would exclude access, parking, common areas, and open space from its

16 calculation of B&B use, which serve almost entirely to accommodate paying guests.

17 April 27, 2022 Planning Commission Remand Hearing and Second Appeal.

18 71. On April 27, 2022, the remand hearing was held before the Planning Commission.

19 Regarding the CMC's accessory use requirements, City Staff offered two methodologies for
20 calculating use.

21 72. The first methodology ("Methodology 1") strictly measures the facility floor area

22 as a ratio of lot size. Under this interpretation, Respondent determined that while the residential

23 use was only 2% of land, the B&B use would be only 7%, because common areas, access, and

24 parking were entirely excluded from consideration as a B&B use:

uonvaod40 mp1 ppuoissafoad y 13 the commercial use, and the commercial use to be no more than 49% of the residential use.

74. The second methodology (*Methodology 2") measures secondary use by

26 Petitioner argued and maintains in this writ that both of these methodologies are so

27 unreasonable as to constitute an abuse of discretion, and that they are reverse-engineered
explanations of a plainly non-compliant project.

28 76. The B&B use of the Parcel is patently greater than 49% of the residential use. The

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 20

AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

-

2 City's attempts to rig the calculations to reach the desired result clearly illustrate that the primary

3 use of the Parcel is a commercial B&B use in violation of the B&B Code. The only arguable

4 proposed residential use on the a Parcel is a portion of a mixed-use commercial/residential manager
cottage - the remainder of the use is almost entirely commercial. The suggestion that guest access

6 and parking is not a commercial B&B use is unsupported by the evidence and belies common

7 sense; the treatment of the proposed mixed-use manager residence and guest reception area and its
surroundings as entirely Residential use is plainly wrong and indefensible.

77. Under Methodology 1, City arbitrarily excludes from its calculation common area

10 and circulation, access, parking, and open space, despite the fact these features exist almost

11 entirely to benefit paying guests. And even then, only 2% of the Parcel is admittedly residential,

DICKENSON PEaTman & FOGARTY 12 despite zoning ordinance requirements for the residential use to be the primary use.

78.

DP&F HOpDIOd100 M91 puoyssafosd V 13 Under Methodology 2, City includes the area directly surrounding the B&Bs, as it

14 should, but again excludes access, parking and open space. It also counts the entire manager

15 office/guest reception unit as residential despite being mixed residential and commercial use. Even

16 still, this methodology admittedly only considers 11% of the property to be a residential use under

17 this inflated calculation. And if access and parking were considered as a B&B use in this

18 methodology, as they should, the B&B use would be 58% of the Parcel, in clear violation of CMC
§ 17.35.010(D).

19 79.

20 In any event, comparing residential to B&B use under any methodology, as

21 required by the Code, would result in a blatant violation of law, as a comparison of residential to

22 commercial use clearly illustrates the commercial B&B use exceeds 49% and that the residential
use is relatively de minimis.

23

24 80. Petitioner/Appellant also noted in its presentation that the Project meets the

25 definition of a hotel under CMC § 17.04.360, pointing out Applicant's repeated blatant advertising

26 of the Cottages as a "hotel", and showing the Planning Commission pictures of four B&Bs in the
R-1-10 district which are all single-family, single-structure dwellings that repurposed somel
27 bedrooms to B&B uses:

11 81. By contrast, the proposed expanded Cottages is comprised of ten separate

DP&F AIQV9O4 A NVNIVEd 'NOSNEDICI 12 with no existing residential use. Proposing merely one mixed-use manager "residence" is a
uoupaod10) avj puossafold V 13 superficial attempt to satisfy the Code's provisions and would at most allow a residential use of

14 only 50% of that one structure.

15 82. Yet despite the requirement that the B&B use be "secondary" to a primary
16 residential use, and that admittedly the residential use of property constituted a maximum of 11%

17 use of the land under the City's most favorable methodology (Methodology 2), the Planning|

18 Commission voted to approve the Project 4-0. That approval was an abuse of discretion.

19 83. Therefore, Petitioner timely appealed the Planning Commission's approval on

20 remand to the City Council. Grounds for the appeal were (1) the hotel (or B&B) use was clearly

21 the primary use on the property and was not secondary to a residential use: (2) the City's
22 calculation of secondary use under the 49% rule was arbitrary and capricious; (3) the Project

23 would authorize construction of a hotel in a residential neighborhood; (4) the Project violates the

24 B&B Code's spacing requirements; and (5) the Parcel's proximity to the Chanric Inn implicates

25 CEQA's cumulative impacts categorical exception. (CEQA Guidelines § 15300.2(b).)

26 June 7, 2022 City Council Remand Appeal Hearing.

27 84. On June 7, 2022, City Council held a final hearing regarding Petitioner's appeal of

28 the Planning Commission's April 27 decision. The Staff Report and analysis largely carried over

23
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

from the Planning Commission remand hearing, but two new issues were discussed.

2 85. First, City Staff added a third methodology ("Methodology 3") to calculate B&B

3 a use as a percentage of land. This methodology arbitrarily excluded access and open space from its

4 calculation. This methodology was again engineered to achieve the desired result.

14

15 86. Through erroneously excluding access and open space, and counting only half of

16 the guest-used common and parking area, this methodology conveniently yielded a 47% B&B use

17 of the property, as well as a 13% residential use entirely based on the manager unit (despite, as

18 discussed above, a major use of this unit being commercial). Had it included even a portion of

19 access or properly allocated the mixed-use structure, Methodology 3 would have eclipsed the 49%
use limitation. In any event, that limitation was itself manufactured again, the code requires a 20

21 comparison of the residential to commercial use, not an absolute limit.

22 87. Second, Petitioner/Appellant argued that City violated the B&B Code's spacingl

23 § requirements. CMC § 17.35.040(c)(1) states that in R-1-10 zones, spacing requirements of B&B's

24 are "not more than one bed and breakfast facility per each side of a City block or one facility per

25 each 500 feet where conventional blocks are not present."

26 88. As discussed above, the Chanric Inn is located next door at 1805 Foothilll

27 Boulevard, adjacent to Applicant's Parcel.

28 89. City Staff's response was that the Cottages was legally nonconforming but made

24
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

-

2 legal via a prior use permit approval in 2015. The expansion was therefore allegedly permitted

3 under the City Code. However, City clearly misreads its own Code. The Rule is that "[a] structure

4 conforming as to use but nonconforming with respect to height, setback or coverage may bel

5 altered or extended if the alteration or extension does not further deviate from the standards of this

6 title." (CMC con 17.44.015(B) (Emphasis added).) By its terms, this Code section does not permit

7 expansion when spacing regulations are violated. "Spacing" requirements are distinct concepts

8 from height, setback or coverage requirements under the City's Code. Therefore, City Staff's
analysis is incorrect and the expansion is in violation of law due to the Cottages' proximity to the

10 Chanric Inn. The spacing requirement is not a "setback" per the CMC, and approval of the Project

11 despite this requirement is in violation of law.

DICKENSON, PEATMAN & FOGARTY 12

DP&F uonpaod1og Mvy ppuoissafosd V 90. Additionally, Petitioner raised the issue on appeal that CEQA categorical

13 exception Section 15300.2(b) - Cumulative Impacts - is implicated by the close proximity of the

14 Project and the Chanric Inn. That exception states: "[a]ll exemptions for these classes are

15 inapplicable when the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place,

16 over time is significant." In its analysis of this exception, City simply stated that the Project would

17 not implicate this exception because "the Site is already disturbed from previous development

18 activities and neighboring parcels are developed." Yet as discussed above, the Project has potential

19 to impact the environment due to is location in the VHFHSZ. Further, during the hearing,|

20 Councilmember Donald Williams noted that the intersection of Foothill Boulevard and the private

21 drive is heavily trafficked, and this expansion may result in additional unsafe traffic flow to an
already dangerous intersection, as well as unsafe conditions for pedestrians attempting to walk to
22 downtown. Yet the City did not address in its analysis of this exception Petitioner's arguments that

23

24 expanding this B&B in the VHFHSZ and in a heavily-trafficked location in close proximity to an

25 existing B&B, may result in significant cumulative impacts, and did not perform any traffic study
analyzing these impacts.

26

27 91. Despite the above, on Staff's recommendation, the City Council voted 4-0 to reject

28 Petitioner's appeal and approve the Project, and adopted the Resolution approving the Project on
June 7, 2022.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 25

1 92. On June 28, Respondent filed a Notice of Exemption with the State Clearinghouse

2 Office of Planning & Research finding that the Project was exempt from CEQA under the Class

3 Categorical Exemption.

4 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

5 (VIOLATION OF CEQA)

6 93. The Petitioner incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in the paragraphs

7 above.

8 94. CEQA requires the lead agency for a project with the potential to cause significant
9 environmental impacts to prepare an EIR that complies with the requirements of the statute,
10 including, but not limited to, the requirement to analyze the project's potentially significant
11 environmental impacts. The EIR must provide sufficient environmental analysis such that the
decision makers can intelligently consider environmental consequences when acting on the
DP&F 40140d109 MDT ppuOjssaforJ V AIHVDO  2 NVNIVId NOSNINDICI 12

13 proposed project.

14 95. In some instances, the lead agency need not prepare an EIR. One such instance

15 includes if the lead agency determines a categorical exemption to CEQA applies such that the

16 Project is exempt from CEQA analysis.

17 96. Whether a Project qualifies for a Categorical Exemption based on the language of

18 the CEQA Guidelines is question of law which is reviewed by Courts de novo. (Holden V. City of

19 San Diego (4th Dist. 2019) 43 Cal. App. 5th 404, 410.) Exemption categories are not to be

20 expanded or broadened beyond the reasonable scope of their statutory language. (Mountain Lion

21 Foundation v. Fish & Game Com. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 125.)

22 97. Further, lead agencies applying categorical exemptions to CEQA must confirm no

23 exceptions to those exemptions exist. One exception is unusual circumstances: "[a] categorical

24 exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity

25 will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances." (CEQA

26 Guidelines § 15300.2(c).) Courts use a two-prong test to determine if this exception applies: (1) is

27 there any substantial evidence that "unusual circumstances" apply to the Project; and (2) is there

28 fair argument "there is a reasonable possibility of a significant effect on the environment due to

26
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 unusual circumstances"? (Berkeley Hillside Pres. V. City of Berkeley (2015) 60 Cal. 4th 1086,

2 1114-15.)

3 98. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law and violated CEQA

4 by:

5 a. Finding the Class 3 Categorical Exemption applies in the first instance. As

6 discussed above, City erroneously expanded the plain language of the Guidelines

7 by reading the exemption to cover a parcel with ten structures, and considered

8 multiple structures regarding the 2,500 square foot limitation in § 15303(c).
.o Reading the categorical exemption to directly contradict the plain language of the
10 CEQA Guidelines is an impermissible broadening of this language in violation of
11 law.

AIXVOO, A9 NVNIVad NOSNIDICI 12 b. Finding that the cumulative impacts exception does not apply. CEQA Guidelines
DP&F uojwaodiog av puojssafoad v 13 15300.2(b) states that "[a]ll exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the
14 cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over

15 time is significant." As discussed above, the Chanric Inn is a B&B directly

16 adjacent to the Parcel. Respondent has failed to respond in the record to

17 Petitioner's claim that the significant expansion of a second B&B within 500 feet

18 of the Parcel implicates this exception, and claims simply that because the Parcell

19 has already been disturbed from previous development and because neighboring

20 parcels are developed, this exception does not apply. Yet as discussed above, the

21 Parcel is in located in a VHFSHZ and is located in heavily-trafficked residential

22 area of the City. Cumulative impacts from this expansion on the environment and

23 traffic will be significant.

24 C. Finding that the unusual circumstances exception does not apply. The Project is

25 located in a Very High Fire Severity Hazard Zone per CAL FIRE modeling and is

26 located at an urban-wildland interface in a residential community, with adjacent

27 heavily-wooded hillsides subject in part to an open space easement. In lieu of

28 increasing wildfire risk in recent years, there is a fair argument of a reasonable

0 N possibility that construction of four additional units on this parcel may

4 significantly impact the environment by increasing the property's already very

5 high fire risk. Indeed, two similar facilities in the County were severely damaged

6 99. or destroyed by wildfires between the Project's original 2020 consideration and the
2022 approval of the Project.

8 Respondents' failure to proceed as required by law and in the absence of
substantial evidence to support

10 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

11 (VIOLATION OF LOCAL LAW, THE CITY OF CALISTOGA GENERAL PLAN

100.

DICKENSON, PEATMAN & FOGARTY 12 AND MUNICIPAL CODE)

above.

DP&F A Professional Law Corporation 13 101. The Petitioner incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in the paragraphs

14

15 The general plan is the "constitution for all future developments" within a City and

16 "the propriety of virtually any local decision affecting land use and development depends upon

17 consistency with the applicable general plan and its elements." (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of

18 Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal. 3d 553, 570.) Further, (1) City's zoning code and its interpretations of

19 the code must be consistent with its General Plan and be reasonable (Families Unafraid to Uphold

20 Rural El Dorado County v. Bd. of Supervisors (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1336); and (2) City's
decision to approve

21 this project must be supported by substantial evidence based on the entire
record. (Id. at 1338.) Further, a City may not interpret their local laws in whatever manner they
desire where General Plan or Code provisions at issue are "fundamental, mandatory and
22 unambiguous." (Id. at 1332.)

23 102.

24

25 City has violated the consistency doctrine, taking actions inconsistent with its own
General Plan in the following ways:

a.

26

27 Applying the CEQA categorical exemption to evade analysis of environmental

28 impacts. This is inconsistent with the City's Land Use, Public Safety, and Circulation Elements.

i. Land Use Element. Objective LU 1.2 requires the City to promote a

balance between visitor-oriented

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE and

AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 28 local-serving commercial

2 development. P1.2-2 requires that new visitor accommodations proposed]

t "shall be required to mitigate all environmental impacts." (Emphasis

† added.) Objective LU 3.2 requires the City to ensure new development
complements Calistoga's small town character and "minimizes impacts on

6 the environment". (Emphasis added.) Despite these mandates, City
applied a categorical exemption to this Projectinvolving new visitor
accommodations-bypassing thorough consideration of potential
environmental impacts despite the Project's location in the VHFHSZ
within a residential zoning district.
10
11 ii. Public Safety Element. The Public Safety Element notes that Foothill

12 Boulevard is characterized by "steep, wooded slopes…within the Very|

DP&F DICKENSON PEatman & FOGARTY uONDIOd1Og MD] ¡puopssafo4d V 13 High Fire Hazard Severity Zone..." (SAF-17.) Further, Goal SAF-3 of that

14 Element is to "[p]rotect lives and property from wildland fire hazard."

15 Implementing this Goal in relevant part is Objective SAF-3.1: "[p]lan new

16 developments with wildland fire hazards in mind." Policy 1 further states

17 "[p]lans for development in the Very High Fire Hazard Area shall bel

18 reviewed for their incorporation of design measures to reduce wildland fire

19 risk." Thus, despite clear General Plan requirements to consider wildfire

20 hazards, particularly in the VHFHSZ, City simply deferred to the Fire

21 Department to ensure compliance with certain state and local fire

22 regulations in construction of the Project. City acted inconsistently with the

23 General Plan by applying the categorical exemption and by not following

24 the SRA/VHFHSZ Fire Safe Regulations which were recently updated in
response to heightened wildfire risk.

25

26 iii. Circulation Element. Objective 1.4 of the Circulation Element states:

27 "[t]he City shall create and maintain a comprehensive and integrated

28 transportation network that provides safe, comfortable and convenient
travel, serving all types of users." City acted inconsistently with this

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 29

AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

an aggressive expansion of visitor - requirement by approving

2 accommodations in an already busy and unsafe intersection, withoutl

3 preparing a thorough traffic analysis of the Project's impacts, particularly

4 given its close proximity to another B&B and without consideration of

5 potential cumulative impacts.

6 b. Approval of : hotel in a Low-Density residential district in violation of the City's

7 General Plan - Land Use Element. (LU-12.)

8 C. Further, several objectives, policies, and actions of the City's Land Use Element
require the City to ensure commercial development is consistent with adjacent uses

10 (in particular lower-intensity uses), to promote a balance between visitor-oriented

11 and local-serving development, and to ensure commercial development does not

12 disturb Calistoga's quality of life and small-town character, including specifically
DP&F uopwaodi0g avl pouojssaoad V Al8VOOA 2 NVNLVAd'NOSNIXDICI 13 with respect to B&Bs. (See Objective LU 1.2 ("[p]romote a balance between

14 visitor-oriented and local-serving commercial development"), Policy P1.2-2

15 ("[n]ew visitor accommodations proposed in Calistoga shall be required to

16 environmental impacts"); Policy P1.2-4 ("[n]ew visitor mitigate all

17 accommodations development shall be designed, constructed and operated sO

18 as to be compatible with adjacent uses, particularly residences"), Action A1.2-

19 - ("[c]ontinue to regulate the expansion of bed-and-breakfast units to ensure an

20 appropriate mix of land uses and to retain the predominantly residential

21 character of established neighborhoods"); Objective LU 1.3 ("[e]nsure that

22 commercial and industrial development is designed, located and operated so as to

23 not disturb Calistoga's quality of life, and approved at a rate and scale that

24 retains Calistoga's small-town character"); Objective LU 3.1 ("[p]revent

25 development from occurring where the location or the physical or biological

26 characteristics of the site would make the land use inappropriate"); Policy 3.1-2

27 (*[n]ew development shall be designed so as to not adversely impact adjacent uses,

28 [in] particular those of lower intensities"); Policy 3.2-1 ("[n]ew development

30
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1

2 shall be designed to respect and enhance Calistoga's small-town rural characterl
and the natural environment") (Emphasis added).)

3 103. Approval of this hotel, or in the alternative B&B with maximum units allowable

4 by law and no pre-existing residential use, is clearly prioritizing over-intensification of

5 commercial visitor-oriented development project over the residential character of the surrounding

6 neighborhood, with minimal regard to adjacent lower-intensity residential uses or Calistoga's

7 small-town character.

8 104. In addition to inconsistencies with the General Plan, City's interpretation of its

9 zoning code is unreasonable and clearly in violation of law in the following ways:

10 a. Approval of a Project with an "accessory" B&B use in a residential zoning district

11

12 with no primary residential use in violation of CMC §§ 17.35.010(D) and
ALAVDO  A NVNLVEd 'NOSNINDICI A Professional Law Corporation 17.04.023, for the reasons discussed above;
DP&F 13
14 b. Adoption of a percentage use methodology contrary to the plain language of CMC

15 § 17.35.010(D) requiring comparison of the residential use to the commercial use,

16 not comparison of the commercial use to the property as a whole;

C.

17 Unreasonable and arbitrary calculation of B&B use under CMC § 17.35.010(D),

18 per the three methodologies offered by City Staff, for the reasons discussed above;

19 d. Violation of B&B spacing requirements under CMC § 17.35.040(c)(1). For the

20 reasons discussed above, Respondent's argument that Cottages can be expanded

21 despite violating spacing requirements is unreasonable because spacingl

22 requirements are distinct from height, setback, and coverage, which are distinct
concepts under the CMC;

23 e.

24 Violation of B&B requirements for findings required to approve maximum units
per CMC §§ 17.35.040(C) et. seq.;

25

26 f. Violation of requirements for use permit approvals per CMC §§ 17.40.030(D)(1)-
(3); and

27 g.

28 Failure to inspect facilities and forward reports to the Planning Commission before
approval in violation of CMC § 17.35.020(H).

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 31

AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 105. City also violated law when it failed to consider as part of the renewal hearings

2 issues related to the scope of the private driveway easement and CC&Rs. City failed to consider

3

4 whether undertaking the proposed project could be accomplished legally. Further the Project
implicates issues of commercial and emergency access, traffic, public safety, and commercial use

5 of the easement, which is relevant to, among other issues, the special circumstances required to

6 approve the maximum of ten units under the B&B Code.

7 106.

8 Respondents' failure to proceed as required by law and in the absence of
substantial evidence to support their decision is an abuse of discretion.

9 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

above. The Petitioner incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in the paragraphs

DP&F DICKENSON, PEATMAN & FOGARTY 12

noppaod40g AvT jouojss3[o4d V 13 108.

14 City violated the SRA/VHFHSZ Fire Safe Regulations by failing to notify the

15 Director of CAL FIRE of the Project which is located within the VHFHSZ, and by failing to

16 incorporate the applicable section of the SRA/VHFHSZ Fire Safe Regulations into the conditions|

17 of approval of the Project, as required by Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 §§ 1270.03(a) and (c)
respectively.

18 109.

19 City was advised of and had actual knowledge of the property's location in the
VHFHSZ prior to approval, but failed to abide by the applicable regulations.

20 110.

21 City's failure to proceed as required by law is an abuse of discretion. Petitioner

therefore seeks relief in the form set forth below.

22 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

23 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as follows:

25 For a Peremptory Writ of Mandate ordering Respondent City to withdraw

26 approval of the challenged Project and to follow CEQA, the City of Calistoga General Plan and

27 Municipal Code, and the SRA/VHFHSZ Fire Safe Regulations in reviewing the Project;

22 INTRODUCTION

23 1. This action seeks to halt the illegal expansion of a hotel in a residential

24 neighborhood. In its zeal to increase tax revenues to the City of Calistoga, its City Council and

25 Planning Commission (collectively, "*City" or "Respondent"), ignored or violated numerous State

26 and local legal requirements.

27 2. As set forth below, the City failed to follow its own zoning code by mislabeling

28 the hotel as a "Bed a and Breakfast" ("B&B"), disregarded or manipulated the zoning requirements

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 for B&Bs, failed to analyze the impacts of the hotel on the environment and neighbors, and

2 ignored unambiguous State requirements for projects in the Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone

3 (*VHFHSZ").

4 3. The City's actions are an abuse of discretion as it has not proceeded in the mannerl

5 provided by law, the decision is not supported by the findings, and the findings are not supported

6 by the evidence.

7 4. Michael P. Glover and Curtis J. Wilhelm (collectively "Petitioner") reside

8 immediately adjacent to the hotel. They hereby seek review and reversal of the decision of the

9 City's approval of the expansion of the Aurora Park Cottages hotel.

10 5. The expansion was initially approved on February 26, 2020, but that approval

11 expired. The plans called for expansion of an existing nominal B&B to (1) construct four
ALaVDOA A NVNIVEd 'NOSNINDICI 12 additional one-bedroom cottages; (2) construct six additional parking spaces and reconfigure one
DP&F uoyvaod4og avl pouopssaford y 13 existing space; (3) convert an existing two-bedroom guest cottage to a front office reception area

14 manager's unit; and (4) new landscaping at and around the cottages. The parcel is 1.44 acres and is

15 located at 1807 Foothill Boulevard, Calistoga, California, 94515 (APN 011-290-051-000) (the

16 "Parcel").

17 6. The Project was never implemented before its expiration. Following the 20201

18 wildfires, and the updates to the State Responsibility Area ("SRA/VHFHSZ") Fire Safel

19 Regulations, the Project was revived on February 9. 2022 without any meaningful analysis, and

20 the City's Planning Commission ("Planning Commission") approved Renewal of Use Permit

21 2022-1 and Design Review 2022-1 (the "Project").

22 7. As discussed in detail below, Petitioner repeatedly opposed the Project. The

23 Planning Commission approved Applicant David Patel and 1807 Foothill, LLC d/b/a Aurora Park

24 Cottages' renewal of the Project over Petitioner's objection, which Petitioner timely appealed to

25 the City of Calistoga City Council ("City Council"'). On appeal, the City Council remanded the
26 Project for further consideration to the Planning Commission. The Project was again approved by

27 the Planning Commission on April 27, 2022.

28 8. Petitioner timely appealed this decision on remand to the City Council, which

2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

thereafter voted to deny the appeal and effectively uphold the Planning Commission's approval

2 on June 7, 2022, adopting Resolution No. 2022-042 (the "Resolution").

9. On June 28, 2022, Respondent filed a Notice of Exemption with the State Officel

4 of Planning and Research finding the Project categorically exempt from the requirements of the

5 California Environmental Quality Act (*CEQA"). This action is timely filed within 35 days of that

6 notice.

7 10. In approving the Project, Respondent failed to comply with CEQA, the
8 SRA/VHFHSZ Fire Safe Regulations, and several elements and sections of the City's General

9 Plan and Municipal Code, respectively.

10 11. Respondent approved the Project in violation of law by inappropriately relying on

11 CEQA Guidelines § 15303 - New Construction or Conversion of Small Structures (Class 3)

DP&F ALaVDOJ A NVNlVad'NOSNIXDICI 12 effectively bypassing review of the Project's potentially significant environmental impacts.
uonvaod102 Mv1 puoissafoad V 13 Respondent relied on this categorical exemption despite the Project failing to meet the plain text of

14 the Guidelines' requirements under §§ 15303 et. seq. It also erroneously concluded the

15 §§ 15300.2(b) and (c) exceptions to the categorical exemption for cumulative impacts and unusual

16 circumstances did not otherwise apply, despite there being a reasonable possibility that the Project

17 will have a significant impact on the environment given the Project's residential location in a Very

18 High Fire Hazard Severity Zone ("VHFHSZ").

19 12. Further, Respondent approved the Project in violation of its own General Plan and
20 numerous provisions of the City of Calistoga Municipal Code (*CMC"). Respondent's

21 interpretation of the City's General Plan is clearly inconsistent with its interpretation of its Zoning

22 Code, and its interpretation of several of its Zoning Code provisions is unreasonable and

23 unsupported by the evidence.

24 13. Respondent also approved the Project in violation of SRA/VHFHSZ Fire Safe

25 Regulations, Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 1270 et seq., including Sections 1270.03(a) and (c). Given

26 these failures, Respondent approved the Project in violation of law.

27 14. The Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court vacate and set aside the denial

28 of the appeal and approval of the Project and order Respondent to comply with CEQA, its own

22 of the Project. In the absence of such remedies, Respondent's approval will remain in effect in

23 violation of state law.

24 BACKGROUND

25 Existing Conditions.

26 26. Applicant owns and operates on Parcel a commercial lodging facility known as the

a 27 Aurora Park Cottages (the "Cottages"). Applicant describes the Cottages on its own website as

28 "hotel." (See Aurora Park Cottages Website, available at www.aurorapark.com/explore).

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 27. There are seven cottages available as guest accommodations, housed in separate
and 2 structures. The seven units are made up of six, 363 square-foot ("sf') one-bedroom cottages

3 one 871 sf two-bedroom cottage with a kitchen. Because the Cottages has more than six units, it

4 meets the City's definition of a "hotel". (CMC § 17.04.360.)

5 28. The Cottages are located at 1807 Foothill Boulevard (State Highway 128),

6 approximately one-half mile north of the intersection of State Highways 128 & 29 and Lincoln

7 Avenue in Calistoga, on the west side of the street.

8 29. The Parcel and Petitioner's property are located within the Brannan Ridge Estates

9 Subdivision ("Subdivision"). The Subdivision was approved in a recorded 1998 Parcel Map

10 (*Parcel Map"), and is further subject to Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions ("CC&Rs")

11 which were recorded with Napa County that same year.

ALXVDO  2 NVNIVEd 'NOSNINDICI 12 30. Guest and manager access to the cottages is only via a private drive a located off of
DP&F MOJWA0d409 MD7 (DHOjSS2JO4d V 13 Foothill Boulevard. The private drive serves the entire Subdivision, which includes several single-

14 family residences and the Cottages. Per the CC&Rs and Parcel Map, access via the private drive is

15 governed by a "private" driveway, drainage and utility easement for the benefit of all parcels in the

16 Subdivision. The Subdivision is also subject to an open space easement, which restricts

17 development of a substantial amount of acreage across the Subdivision's parcels.

18 31. The Cottages have already established eight parking spaces along the private drive.

19 Per the above, Petitioner shares an access easement over this private drive with the Applicant, and
20 all access and parking to the Project is off of this shared driveway.

21 32. The common area and space directly surrounding the cottages is wholly occupied

22 by walkways and landscaping which is purely designed to serve B&B guests. Below is a picture a

15 Proposed Project.

16 34. The Project proposes (1) construction of four additional 600-sf one-bedroom

17 cottages; (2) construction of six additional parking spaces and reconfiguration of one existing;

18 (3) conversion of the existing two-bedroom guest cottage to a front office reception area and

19 manager's unit, including 661-sf addition for a new total of 1,532 sf; and (4) new landscaping at

20 and around the cottages.
to a mixed-use 21 35. Given the existing two-bedroom guest cottage will be converted
guest reception, office, and manager residence, the Project will result in a total of ten guest units, 22

23 as well as fourteen parking spaces.

24 General Plan Designation and Zoning Regulations.

25 36. The Parcel is designated Low-Density Residential under the City's General Plan

26 and is zoned R-1-10: One-Family Zoning District (*R-1-10"). The purpose of this Designation and

27 Zoning is to allow the development of single-family and special needs residential uses that are

28 consistent with the Calistoga General Plan and State law, in a manner that provides generous

2 37. General Plan. Together with compatible accessory uses, the Low-Density

3 Residential Designation permits "schools, bed-and-breakfast inns; home occupations; and religious

4 facilities". "if they conform to all relevant General Plan policies[.]" (Land Use Element ("LU"),
LU-11.) In addition to the above, the following General Plan objectives, policies, and actions from

6 the Land Use Element are relevant.
a. Hotels are permitted for development in the Community Commercial Land Usel
Designation, not Low-Density Residential. (LU-11-12.)
O b. Objective LU 1.2: "[p]romote a balance between visitor-oriented and local-

39. The Circulation Element states:

10 a. Objective CIR-1.4: "[t]he City shall create and maintain a comprehensive and
11 integrated transportation network that provides safe, comfortable and convenient

AlHVDOH A NYNIVEd 'NOSNINDICI 12 travel, serving all types of users.3
DP&F voymaod109 M1 ppuojssaford V 13 40. Zoning.

14 a. Given its R-1-10 zoning, Foothill Boulevard consists of primarily single-family

15 residences. There is an existing B&B, the Chanric Inn. located directly south of the

16 Cottages at 1805 Foothill Boulevard. The Chanric Inn was formerly a single-

17 family dwelling that was converted to a B&B, with all units contained in one

18 residential structure. Other B&Bs in the zoning district are similarly single-family

19 dwellings with bedrooms converted to B&B units, unlike the Project which is

20 proposed to be ten stand-alone units, more similar to a hotel resort.

21 b. The Project meets the City's definition of a hotel under the CMC § 17.04.360 (*a

22 facility of six or more units located in a single structure or individual structures,

23 which may be connected by corridors or outdoor pedestrian walkways. The facility

24 shall have the primary purpose of providing transient lodging accommodations, as

25 contemplated by Chapter 3.16 CMC, to the general public.").

26 c. CMC § 17.04.023 states ''[a]ccessory use' shall mean a use that is incidental and

27 subordinate to a principal use on a site and is customarily found on the same

28 site." (Emphasis added.)

9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

2 d. Further, the City regulates B&Bs under CMC Chapter 17.35 (the "B&B Code").
The B&B Code regulates, inter alia, (1) primary & accessory use restrictions in R-

3 1-10 districts, (2) spacing requirements, and (3) maximum number of units.

4 e. B&Bs are defined as "the rental of rooms or space for the purpose of providing

5 overnight accommodations for paying guests for a period not to exceed 30 days

6 per individual rental, with not more than one meal to be provided daily, and with

7

8 the entire service offered to be included in one stated price." (CMC § 17.04.085.)

f. The B&B Code requires B&B uses to be accessory to a primary residential use on
parcels in R-1-10 districts. CMC § 17.35.010(D) states:
10
11 "It is further the purpose of these regulations to provide for bed and breakfast facilities which are accessory to and secondary to the primary residential use of land in residentially zoned areas. The

uonDIOd109 M71 ppuojssafoad V DICKENSON, PEATMAN & FOGARTY 12 terms "accessory" and "secondary" mean that the establishment of
DP&F 13 bed and breakfast facilities in residential zones shall not exceed 49

14 percent of the use of the land and/or building area on and in which
the facilities are to be located."

15 (Emphasis added.)

16 g. The B&B Code's requirements regarding maximum units are set out in CMC §S

17 17.35.040(C) et. seq.

18 i. In R-1-10 zones, a maximum of two units are allowed. (CMC c0

19 17.35.040(C)(2)(a).)

20 ii. The maximum number of B&B units may be increased to six, subject to a

21 major use permit, if the following special circumstances exist: (a)

22 proximity to a state highway; (b) historical character and/or significance of

23 structures; (c) character of proposed site relative to its surroundings; (d)

24 nature of ingress and egress; (e) adequacy of number and location of off-

25 street parking spaces and maneuvering areas; and (f) provision of roomsl

26 accessible to developmentally disabled. (CMC §§ 17.35.040(C)(3)(a)-(f).)

27 iii. Further, a limited exception allowing an increase to ten units (but no more)

28 can be met if in addition to the above special circumstances, the following

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 10

AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

are also met: (a) a B&B was authorized on

2 property before January 1,
2010; (b) the property is in an R-1-10 zone; (c) the property has

4 maximum of 10 units; and (d) there is a minimum lot size of 10,000 sf.
(CMC §§ 17.35.040(C)(4)(a)-(d).)

5 h. CMC §17.35.020(H) states that "[a]ll facilities shall be inspected on an annual

6 basis by the Planning and Building Department for conformance with use permit

7 conditions and the regulations established in this title. Inspection reports shall be

8 forwarded to the Planning Commission for informational purposes, as
necessary." (Emphasis added).

10 i

11 Further, all B&Bs require a use permit. (CMC § 17.35.030.) In conditionally

DP&F AIXVDOH AU NVNIVIJ NOSNINDICI 12 approving a use permit application, the CMC requires the local agency to find that

A Professional Law Corporation 13 the Project is, among others, (1) "in accord with the General Plan and any

14 applicable planned development"; (2) "[i]s in accord with all applicable provisions

15 of this title"; and (3) "[w]ill not substantially impair or interfere with the

16 development, use or enjoyment of other property in the vicinity." (CMC §

17.40.030(D)(1)-(3).)

17

18 Project area is designated Very High Fire Hazard Severity by CAL FIRE.

41.
19 The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection ("CAL FIRE")

20 classifies the severity of fire hazards in areas of California. Lands are either ranked Moderate,

21 High, or Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones. (CAL FIRE Website, available at

22 https://osfm.fire.ca.gov/divisions/community-wildfire-preparedness-and-mitigation/wildfire-

23 preparedness/fire-hazard-severity-zones/.) These classifications are determined by a science-based

24 and field-tested model which assigns a fire hazard score based on factors such as fire history,

25 existing and potential fuel, predicted flame length, blowing embers, terrain, and typical fire

weather for the area.
26 42.
27 The Parcel is located in the highest fire hazard category, Very High Fire Hazard

28 Severity Zone, at an urban-wildland interface between residential neighborhoods and the City. The

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 11

AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

2 adjacent hillsides are heavily wooded, and the Subdivision is covered in part by an open space
easement that preserves large swaths of the woodlands in the Subdivision.
43. In response to severe wildfire dangers and risks to the urban-wildland interface

4 from recent wildfires throughout the State, CAL FIRE amended, through rulemaking effective July

6 1, 2021, the State Responsibility Area Fire Safe Regulations to apply to the Very High Fire Hazard
Severity Zone, and renominated the SRA/VHFHSZ Fire Safe Regulations, Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14
§§ 1270.00 et seq. This rule change occurred between the City's approval of the Project prior to its
expiration and the subsequent renewal of the Project, and was applicable to the City's
consideration of the Project applied for in 2022.

10 44.

11 Sections 1270.03(a)-(c) of the SRA/VHFHSZ Fire Safe Regulations provide:

"(a)
AIAVDO  2g NVNIVEd NOSNINDIC 12 local jurisdictions shall provide the Director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection or their

DP&F A Professional Law Corporation 13 designee with notice of applications for building permits,

14 tentative parcel maps, tentative maps, and installation or use permits for construction or development within the SRA or,

(b) after July 1, 2021, the VHFHSZ;
15 the Director or their designee may review and make fire

16 protection recommendations on applicable construction or

(c) development permits or maps provided by the local jurisdiction;

17 the local jurisdiction shall ensure that the applicable sections of

18 this subchapter become a condition of approval of any
applicable construction or development permit or map."

19 (Emphasis added.)

20 45. The City was obligated to comply with the SRA/VHFHSZ Fire Safe Regulations

21 in consideration of the project, including Sections 1270.03(a) and (c) thereof, but based on the

22 record did not do so.

23 CEQA Categorical Exemption.

24 46. The Project is a "project" for the purposes of CEQA. Respondent determined that

25 the Project is Categorically Exempt from CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines § 15303 - New

26 Construction or Conversion of Small Structures (Class 3). This purpose of this exemption is to

27 exempt from CEQA's provisions the construction of limited, small facilities:

28 "Class 3 consists of construction and location of limited numbers of new, small

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 12

AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- facilities or structures; installation of small new equipment and facilities in small

2 structures; and the conversion of existing small structures from one use to another where only minor modifications are made in the exterior of the structure. The numbers of structures described in this Section are the maximum allowable
on any legal parcel. Examples of this exemption include but are not limited to:...

4

5 (b) A duplex or similar multi-family residential structure totaling no more than four dwelling units. In urbanized areas, this exemption applies to

6 apartments, duplexes, and similar structures designed for not more than six
dwelling units.

7 (c) A store, motel, office, restaurant or similar structure not involving the use of significant amounts of hazardous substances, and not exceeding 2,500 square feet in floor area. In urbanized areas, the

o exemption also applies to up to four such commercial buildings not exceeding 10,000 square feet in floor area on sites zoned for such use if

10 not involving the use of significant amounts of hazardous substances where all necessary public services and facilities are available and the

11 surrounding area is not environmentally sensitive..."

DICKENSON, PEATMAN & FOGARTY 12 (Emphasis added.)
47.
DP&F 101a0dI03 MD] ¡uoissaford y 13 Per the plain language of the above Guidelines, this exemption only allows for use

14 on a legal parcel of up to a four dwelling units in a non-urban area and not more than six dwelling|

15 units in an urban area. Further, the 2,500 square foot limitation is applicable to a single

16 commercial structure. (The Cottages are not in an urbanized area, and the 10,000-sf limit for four

17 structures is inapplicable.)

48.
18 City erroneously relied on this exemption by considering only the four additionall

19 structures to be built as part of the Project. However, the Project actually consists of five structures

20 four new cottages and significant construction to and expansion of a fifth and ignores that ten

21 total structures would exist on the Parcel after construction.

49.
22 City also mistakenly considered the four new structures together to be below the

23 2,500-sf limitation when Subsection C, by its own terms, only applies to one structure. Thus City

24 relied on this exemption in violation of the plain language of §§ 15303(b)-(c).

50.
25 Further, even if the Project qualified 3 for the Class 3 exemption (which it does not),

26 Respondent must confirm no categorical exceptions apply, including, inter alia, whether

27 cumulative impacts of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time, are

28 significant (CEQA Guidelines § 15300.2(b)), and whether unusual circumstances exist that could

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 13

AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

result in a significant impact on the environment. (CEQA Guidelines § 15300.2(c).)

2 51. As stated above, the Parcel is located in a Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone,

3 and upon completion will reach the B&B's absolute maximum of ten units in a low-density

4 residential neighborhood. Such a large commercial lodging facility--hotel or B&Bin a heavily

5 wooded urban-wildland interface covered in part by open space easements, and with the highest

6 fire risk designated by CAL FIRE. implicates unusual circumstances distinguishing the Project

7 from other categorically exempt projects.

8 52. Given very high fire risk generally in recent years, including nearby the project,

9 and subsequent updating of the SRA/VHFHSZ Fire Safe Regulations due to this increasing risk,

10 City should have at the very least prepared an initial study to determine potential environmental

11 impacts. Yet City claims that there is "no evidence" in the record that there is any reasonable
AIQVOO! A NVNIVAd NOSNINDIC 12 possibility that the Project will have a significant effect on the environment.
DP&F H0jDAOd409 MDT pu0jss2{04d V 13 53. Further, although the Chanric Inn B&B is located within 500 feet of the Parcel,

14 Respondent did not consider the significant expansion resulting from the Project may result in

15 significant cumulative impacts on the environment, traffic, and public safety despite the adjacent

16 proximity of these B&Bs.

17 PROCEDURAL HISTORY

18 Initial Project Approval and Expiration.

19 54. In 2018, Real Party in Interest initially applied for approval of the expansion of the

20 Cottages (Use Permit application 2018-12 and Design Review application 2018-9). The Planning

21 Commission approved those applications on February 26, 2020 - before the 2020 LNU Complex

22 and Glass Fires.

23 55. Condition of Approval 3 provided that the approval "shall be null and void if not

24 used within a one-year period," and that the Planning & Building Director may extend that time by

25 up to 12 months. The Project was approved on the grounds that it is allegedly consistent with the

26 General Plan designation for the property as low-density residential and the R-1-10 zoning district,

27 and that it was exempt categorically exempt from CEQA under Class 3 (discussed above).

28 56. Development on the Project was delayed. Thus, in December 2020, City Staff

14
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

granted a one-year

2 extension of the use permit and design review applications. However, with the
entitlements due to expire in March 2022, and Applicant aware that the Project could not be

4 undertaken within the extension period, Applicant requested renewal of its applications in early

2022.

57.

6 Applicant's renewal of the Project resulted in four hearings: (1) the February 9,

7 2022 Planning Commission hearing approving the Project; (2) the March 15, 2022 City Council

8 hearing on Petitioner's appeal of the February 9 approval, which remanded the Project to the

9 Planning Commission; (3) the April 27, 2022 Planning Commission remand hearing which again

10 approved the Project; and (4) the June 7. 2022 City Council hearing of Petitioner/Appellant's

11 further appeal following the remand, which upheld the Planning Commission's second approval.
February 9, 2022 Planning Commission Hearing.

12 58.

DP&F uoypiodiog mvy puotssafead y DICKENSON, PEATMAN & FOGARTY 13 In advance of the hearing, City Staff prepared a report recommending approval of

14 the Project to the Planning Commission. The report relied almost entirely on the previous Project

15 approval from nearly two-years prior, despite Staff's acknowledgment that "[i]f the [] draft
resolution is approved, this would effectively be a brand-new use permit and design review project
16 entitlement." City Staff expressly relied in its report on the resolution approved two-years prior to

17 "reduce repetition."

18 59. The Planning Commission relied almost entirely on Staff's
19 recommendations, which report and

20 per the above was based almost entirely on the February 26, 2020

21 approval. Virtually no new analysis was undertaken in the hearing despite receiving four public

22 letters of concern, including from Petitioner's lawyer; comments at the hearing from Petitioner's

23 lawyer expressing concern regarding the Project; heightened fire risk in light of major wildfires in

24 northern Napa County since the 2020 approval; the amendment of the SRA/VHFHSZ Fire

25 Regulations to apply to all VHFHSZs, including those in local responsibility areas; and the

26 Planning Commission consisting of two new members since the initial approval.

60.

27 Petitioner's comments focused on the fact that the private drive granting access to

28 the Cottages and Petitioner's property was governed by a private easement for residential
purposes, which does not include commercial access, and particularly not at the intensity proposed

AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

2 by the Project. Yet the Planning Commissioners and City Staff were dismissive of this issue,

4 expressly declining to even hear arguments related to the easement on the unsubstantiated grounds
that the scope of the easement and CC&Rs is a civil matter "between property owners" and not an

6 issue for the Planning Commission to "deal with". The thrust of Petitioner's arguments was/
therefore largely ignored, and on the remaining issues raised relating to the City's interpretation of
the B&B Code, the Planning Commission simply deferred to Staff's interpretation and largely
declined to engage on the merits.

10 At conclusion of the February 9 hearing, the Planning Commission voted to

First Appeal.

11 62.

DP&F DICKENSON, PEATMAN & FOGARTY 12

A Professional Law Corporation 13 63. On February 20, 2022, Petitioner timely appealed that decision to the City Council.
Petitioner asserted several grounds for appeal.

14

15 Ground #1: The B&B use is not accessory/secondary to a primary residential use,
in violation of the City Zoning Ordinance.

16

17 a. The CMC clearly requires B&B use to be accessory to a primary residential use in
R-1-10 districts. CMC § 17.35.010(D) states:

18

19 "It is further the purpose of these regulations to provide for

20 bed and breakfast facilities which are accessory to and secondary to the primary residential use of land in

21 residentially zoned areas. The terms "accessory" and "*secondary" mean that the establishment of bed and breakfast

22 facilities in residential zones shall not exceed 49 percent of the use of the land and/or building area on and in which the
facilities are to be located."

23

24 (Emphasis added). In short, a B&B must be the owner/operator's residence, and

25 less than half of it may be used to serve guests. The plain language of the Code requires comparing land to land, or building area to building area to determine the

land) ratio.

26 ratio of uses. The 49% limitation does not limit the lot coverage (building-area to

28 b. Further, CMC § 17.04.023 defines "accessory use" as "a use that is incidental
and subordinate to a principal use on a
same site." (Emphasis added.) site and is customarily found on the

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 16

c. The Project has no existing residential use and proposes only a de minimis mixed-
use building as a guest reception and manager office/residence, the floor area of
w which comprises merely 2% of the total Parcel size. Thus, Petitioner alleged (and
maintains for the purposes of this writ) a violation of the CMC because
§ 17.35.010(D) requires the B&B use to be less than 49% of the use.

6 d. Further, the B&B use must be incidental and subordinate to a principal residentiall

7 use. Clearly, the primary use here is a commercial hotel use in violation of the
B&B Code, considering >90% of the structures on the property and essentially
all of the developed exterior access, parking, and open space serve to

10 accommodate and benefit paying guests and are intended primarily for commerciall

11 use.

AIHVDO4 A9 NVWIVEd 'NOSNIDICI 12 64. Ground #2: City violated B&B Code requirements of § 17.35.040(C) regarding
DP&F uOIDAOd109 MPT pouopssafosd V 13 maximum units.

14 a. Per the requirements discussed above, CMC § 17.35.040(C)(2) provides for a

15 maximum of two units or rooms for B&Bs in R-1-10 zones. Subsection (3) allows

16 for an increase to six units if six special circumstances can be met. Subsection (4)

17 allows for a maximum increase to 10 units if an additional four special

18 circumstances can be met.

19 b. City had previously only analyzed the exception under § 17.35.040(C)(4), and did

20 not analyze the exception under Subsection (C)(3) as required by law. See

21 Paragraph 40(g) above for the list of special circumstances. Although Respondent

22 performed this analysis in subsequent staff reports, their analysis is ultimately

23 flawed for several reasons. For example, CMC § 17.35.040(C)(3)(c) requires City

24 to consider the character of the proposed site relative to its surroundings. City's

25 rationale focuses largely on design elements of the Project instead of the morel

26 important issue that the Project, which will result in construction of essentially a

27 10-unit hotel, currently with no residential use - is blatantly out-of-character

28 compared to its surroundings. Further, Subsection D requires City to consider the

17
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- nature of ingress and egress, yet the City did not prepare any traffic study or

2 analysis, and similarly prepared no analysis of turning movements of cars backing

3 out of parking spaces into the shared private drive, nor an analysis of commerciall
4 vehicle deliveries and access, despite the intersection of the private drive and

5 Foothill Boulevard (State Highway 128) being heavily trafficked. City also

6 expressly declined to consider the scope of the private driveway easement and its

7 restrictions/limitations on commercial access, use, and intensity, the consideration

8 of which is crucial to and required by this special circumstance. It is also
o noteworthy and cause for concern, given increased fire risks and commercial
10 intensification of this residentially zoned property with no primary residential use,

11 that the Parcel proposes the maximum allowable B&B units under the Code.
12 65. Ground #3: Inappropriate Reliance on the CEQA Categorical Exemption.
DP&F uoppaod1og avj ppuopssaford y AIXVD0- A NVNIVEd DICKENSON, 13 a. See discussion above.

14 66. Ground #4: Failure to Inspect Facilities per CMC § 17.35.020(H).

15 a. CMC §17.35.020(H) states that all facilities shall be inspected on an annual basis

16 by the Planning and Building Department for conformance with use permit

17 conditions and the regulations established in this title, and inspection reports shall

18 be forwarded to the Planning Commission for informational purposes, as

19 necessary. Petitioner alleged (and still does) that such inspection prior to

20 approving was "necessary", and such inspection would determine the existing and

21 proposed uses do not comply with the B&B Code and the City's use permit

22 regulations.

23 67. Ultimately, the appeal requested that the City Council overturn the Planning

24 Commission's approval of the Project, or in the alternative, to remand the Project to the Planning

25 Commission for "full consideration and analysis of the issues raised as part of [the] appeal."

26 March 15, 2022 City Council Hearing and Remand.

27 68. An appeal hearing was held before the City Council on March 15, 2022. The

28 issues discussed above were raised during presentation by Petitioner, including an analysis of the

18
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- General Plan's inconsistencies with Project approval.

2 69. The City Council focused largely on CMC § 17.35.010(D)'s requirement that the

3 B&B use cannot be more than 49% of building area or land. In particular, Councilmember Donald

4 Williams noted his opposition to the Project, and expressed uncertainty surrounding whether the

5 B&B use on the Parcel is accessory to and secondary to a primary residential use on the property,

6 including questioning the City's methodology for calculating the B&B use as a ratio of lot size.

7 City Staff and the Planning Commission's position was to add the floor area of the 10 units

8 (totaling 6,110 sf) and divide that by the Parcel size (62,727 sf) for a B&B use of 9.74%. Yet the

9 City Council rightly raised concerns over this methodology, as City Staff's methodology entirely

10 from its calculation of B&B use, and in excluded access, parking, common areas, and open space

11 any event erroneously failed to compare residential to B&B use in violation of the plain text of the
AL8V9O4 A NVNIVAd 'NOSNIADICI 12 Code.

DP&F uoypaod.00 au1 ppuorssaford V 13 70. Thus, the City Council voted to remand the Project to the Planning Commission

14 for analysis of precedential decisions to determine the appropriate methodology, including

15 explaining why the City would exclude access, parking, common areas, and open space from its

16 calculation of B&B use, which serve almost entirely to accommodate paying guests.

17 April 27, 2022 Planning Commission Remand Hearing and Second Appeal.

18 71. On April 27, 2022, the remand hearing was held before the Planning Commission.

19 Regarding the CMC's accessory use requirements, City Staff offered two methodologies for
20 calculating use.

21 72. The first methodology ("Methodology 1") strictly measures the facility floor area

22 as a ratio of lot size. Under this interpretation, Respondent determined that while the residential

23 use was only 2% of land, the B&B use would be only 7%, because common areas, access, and

24 parking were entirely excluded from consideration as a B&B use:

uonvaod40 mp1 ppuoissafoad y 13 the commercial use, and the commercial use to be no more than 49% of the residential use.

74. The second methodology (*Methodology 2") measures secondary use by

26 Petitioner argued and maintains in this writ that both of these methodologies are so

27 unreasonable as to constitute an abuse of discretion, and that they are reverse-engineered
explanations of a plainly non-compliant project.

28 76. The B&B use of the Parcel is patently greater than 49% of the residential use. The

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 20

AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

-

2 City's attempts to rig the calculations to reach the desired result clearly illustrate that the primary

3 use of the Parcel is a commercial B&B use in violation of the B&B Code. The only arguable

4 proposed residential use on the a Parcel is a portion of a mixed-use commercial/residential manager
cottage - the remainder of the use is almost entirely commercial. The suggestion that guest access

6 and parking is not a commercial B&B use is unsupported by the evidence and belies common

7 sense; the treatment of the proposed mixed-use manager residence and guest reception area and its
surroundings as entirely Residential use is plainly wrong and indefensible.

77. Under Methodology 1, City arbitrarily excludes from its calculation common area

10 and circulation, access, parking, and open space, despite the fact these features exist almost

11 entirely to benefit paying guests. And even then, only 2% of the Parcel is admittedly residential,

DICKENSON PEaTman & FOGARTY 12 despite zoning ordinance requirements for the residential use to be the primary use.

78.

DP&F HOpDIOd100 M91 puoyssafosd V 13 Under Methodology 2, City includes the area directly surrounding the B&Bs, as it

14 should, but again excludes access, parking and open space. It also counts the entire manager

15 office/guest reception unit as residential despite being mixed residential and commercial use. Even

16 still, this methodology admittedly only considers 11% of the property to be a residential use under

17 this inflated calculation. And if access and parking were considered as a B&B use in this

18 methodology, as they should, the B&B use would be 58% of the Parcel, in clear violation of CMC
§ 17.35.010(D).

19 79.

20 In any event, comparing residential to B&B use under any methodology, as

21 required by the Code, would result in a blatant violation of law, as a comparison of residential to

22 commercial use clearly illustrates the commercial B&B use exceeds 49% and that the residential
use is relatively de minimis.

23

24 80. Petitioner/Appellant also noted in its presentation that the Project meets the

25 definition of a hotel under CMC § 17.04.360, pointing out Applicant's repeated blatant advertising

26 of the Cottages as a "hotel", and showing the Planning Commission pictures of four B&Bs in the
R-1-10 district which are all single-family, single-structure dwellings that repurposed somel
27 bedrooms to B&B uses:

11 81. By contrast, the proposed expanded Cottages is comprised of ten separate

DP&F AIQV9O4 A NVNIVEd 'NOSNEDICI 12 with no existing residential use. Proposing merely one mixed-use manager "residence" is a
uoupaod10) avj puossafold V 13 superficial attempt to satisfy the Code's provisions and would at most allow a residential use of

14 only 50% of that one structure.

15 82. Yet despite the requirement that the B&B use be "secondary" to a primary
16 residential use, and that admittedly the residential use of property constituted a maximum of 11%

17 use of the land under the City's most favorable methodology (Methodology 2), the Planning|

18 Commission voted to approve the Project 4-0. That approval was an abuse of discretion.

19 83. Therefore, Petitioner timely appealed the Planning Commission's approval on

20 remand to the City Council. Grounds for the appeal were (1) the hotel (or B&B) use was clearly

21 the primary use on the property and was not secondary to a residential use: (2) the City's
22 calculation of secondary use under the 49% rule was arbitrary and capricious; (3) the Project

23 would authorize construction of a hotel in a residential neighborhood; (4) the Project violates the

24 B&B Code's spacing requirements; and (5) the Parcel's proximity to the Chanric Inn implicates

25 CEQA's cumulative impacts categorical exception. (CEQA Guidelines § 15300.2(b).)

26 June 7, 2022 City Council Remand Appeal Hearing.

27 84. On June 7, 2022, City Council held a final hearing regarding Petitioner's appeal of

28 the Planning Commission's April 27 decision. The Staff Report and analysis largely carried over

23
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

from the Planning Commission remand hearing, but two new issues were discussed.

2 85. First, City Staff added a third methodology ("Methodology 3") to calculate B&B

3 a use as a percentage of land. This methodology arbitrarily excluded access and open space from its

4 calculation. This methodology was again engineered to achieve the desired result.

14

15 86. Through erroneously excluding access and open space, and counting only half of

16 the guest-used common and parking area, this methodology conveniently yielded a 47% B&B use

17 of the property, as well as a 13% residential use entirely based on the manager unit (despite, as

18 discussed above, a major use of this unit being commercial). Had it included even a portion of

19 access or properly allocated the mixed-use structure, Methodology 3 would have eclipsed the 49%
use limitation. In any event, that limitation was itself manufactured again, the code requires a 20

21 comparison of the residential to commercial use, not an absolute limit.

22 87. Second, Petitioner/Appellant argued that City violated the B&B Code's spacingl

23 § requirements. CMC § 17.35.040(c)(1) states that in R-1-10 zones, spacing requirements of B&B's

24 are "not more than one bed and breakfast facility per each side of a City block or one facility per

25 each 500 feet where conventional blocks are not present."

26 88. As discussed above, the Chanric Inn is located next door at 1805 Foothilll

27 Boulevard, adjacent to Applicant's Parcel.

28 89. City Staff's response was that the Cottages was legally nonconforming but made

24
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

-

2 legal via a prior use permit approval in 2015. The expansion was therefore allegedly permitted

3 under the City Code. However, City clearly misreads its own Code. The Rule is that "[a] structure

4 conforming as to use but nonconforming with respect to height, setback or coverage may bel

5 altered or extended if the alteration or extension does not further deviate from the standards of this

6 title." (CMC con 17.44.015(B) (Emphasis added).) By its terms, this Code section does not permit

7 expansion when spacing regulations are violated. "Spacing" requirements are distinct concepts

8 from height, setback or coverage requirements under the City's Code. Therefore, City Staff's
analysis is incorrect and the expansion is in violation of law due to the Cottages' proximity to the

10 Chanric Inn. The spacing requirement is not a "setback" per the CMC, and approval of the Project

11 despite this requirement is in violation of law.

DICKENSON, PEATMAN & FOGARTY 12

DP&F uonpaod1og Mvy ppuoissafosd V 90. Additionally, Petitioner raised the issue on appeal that CEQA categorical

13 exception Section 15300.2(b) - Cumulative Impacts - is implicated by the close proximity of the

14 Project and the Chanric Inn. That exception states: "[a]ll exemptions for these classes are

15 inapplicable when the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place,

16 over time is significant." In its analysis of this exception, City simply stated that the Project would

17 not implicate this exception because "the Site is already disturbed from previous development

18 activities and neighboring parcels are developed." Yet as discussed above, the Project has potential

19 to impact the environment due to is location in the VHFHSZ. Further, during the hearing,|

20 Councilmember Donald Williams noted that the intersection of Foothill Boulevard and the private

21 drive is heavily trafficked, and this expansion may result in additional unsafe traffic flow to an
already dangerous intersection, as well as unsafe conditions for pedestrians attempting to walk to
22 downtown. Yet the City did not address in its analysis of this exception Petitioner's arguments that

23

24 expanding this B&B in the VHFHSZ and in a heavily-trafficked location in close proximity to an

25 existing B&B, may result in significant cumulative impacts, and did not perform any traffic study
analyzing these impacts.

26

27 91. Despite the above, on Staff's recommendation, the City Council voted 4-0 to reject

28 Petitioner's appeal and approve the Project, and adopted the Resolution approving the Project on
June 7, 2022.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 25

1 92. On June 28, Respondent filed a Notice of Exemption with the State Clearinghouse

2 Office of Planning & Research finding that the Project was exempt from CEQA under the Class

3 Categorical Exemption.

4 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

5 (VIOLATION OF CEQA)

6 93. The Petitioner incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in the paragraphs

7 above.

8 94. CEQA requires the lead agency for a project with the potential to cause significant
9 environmental impacts to prepare an EIR that complies with the requirements of the statute,
10 including, but not limited to, the requirement to analyze the project's potentially significant
11 environmental impacts. The EIR must provide sufficient environmental analysis such that the
decision makers can intelligently consider environmental consequences when acting on the
DP&F 40140d109 MDT ppuOjssaforJ V AIHVDO  2 NVNIVId NOSNINDICI 12

13 proposed project.

14 95. In some instances, the lead agency need not prepare an EIR. One such instance

15 includes if the lead agency determines a categorical exemption to CEQA applies such that the

16 Project is exempt from CEQA analysis.

17 96. Whether a Project qualifies for a Categorical Exemption based on the language of

18 the CEQA Guidelines is question of law which is reviewed by Courts de novo. (Holden V. City of

19 San Diego (4th Dist. 2019) 43 Cal. App. 5th 404, 410.) Exemption categories are not to be

20 expanded or broadened beyond the reasonable scope of their statutory language. (Mountain Lion

21 Foundation v. Fish & Game Com. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 125.)

22 97. Further, lead agencies applying categorical exemptions to CEQA must confirm no

23 exceptions to those exemptions exist. One exception is unusual circumstances: "[a] categorical

24 exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity

25 will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances." (CEQA

26 Guidelines § 15300.2(c).) Courts use a two-prong test to determine if this exception applies: (1) is

27 there any substantial evidence that "unusual circumstances" apply to the Project; and (2) is there

28 fair argument "there is a reasonable possibility of a significant effect on the environment due to

26
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 unusual circumstances"? (Berkeley Hillside Pres. V. City of Berkeley (2015) 60 Cal. 4th 1086,

2 1114-15.)

3 98. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law and violated CEQA

4 by:

5 a. Finding the Class 3 Categorical Exemption applies in the first instance. As

6 discussed above, City erroneously expanded the plain language of the Guidelines

7 by reading the exemption to cover a parcel with ten structures, and considered

8 multiple structures regarding the 2,500 square foot limitation in § 15303(c).
.o Reading the categorical exemption to directly contradict the plain language of the
10 CEQA Guidelines is an impermissible broadening of this language in violation of
11 law.

AIXVOO, A9 NVNIVad NOSNIDICI 12 b. Finding that the cumulative impacts exception does not apply. CEQA Guidelines
DP&F uojwaodiog av puojssafoad v 13 15300.2(b) states that "[a]ll exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the
14 cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over

15 time is significant." As discussed above, the Chanric Inn is a B&B directly

16 adjacent to the Parcel. Respondent has failed to respond in the record to

17 Petitioner's claim that the significant expansion of a second B&B within 500 feet

18 of the Parcel implicates this exception, and claims simply that because the Parcell

19 has already been disturbed from previous development and because neighboring

20 parcels are developed, this exception does not apply. Yet as discussed above, the

21 Parcel is in located in a VHFSHZ and is located in heavily-trafficked residential

22 area of the City. Cumulative impacts from this expansion on the environment and

23 traffic will be significant.

24 C. Finding that the unusual circumstances exception does not apply. The Project is

25 located in a Very High Fire Severity Hazard Zone per CAL FIRE modeling and is

26 located at an urban-wildland interface in a residential community, with adjacent

27 heavily-wooded hillsides subject in part to an open space easement. In lieu of

28 increasing wildfire risk in recent years, there is a fair argument of a reasonable

27
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

0 N possibility that construction of four additional units on this parcel may

4 significantly impact the environment by increasing the property's already very

5 high fire risk. Indeed, two similar facilities in the County were severely damaged

6 99. or destroyed by wildfires between the Project's original 2020 consideration and the
2022 approval of the Project.

7

8 Respondents' failure to proceed as required by law and in the absence of
substantial evidence to support

9 their decision is an abuse of discretion.

10 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

11 (VIOLATION OF LOCAL LAW, THE CITY OF CALISTOGA GENERAL PLAN

100.

DICKENSON, PEATMAN & FOGARTY 12 AND MUNICIPAL CODE)

above.

DP&F A Professional Law Corporation 13 101. The Petitioner incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in the paragraphs

14

15 The general plan is the "constitution for all future developments" within a City and

16 "the propriety of virtually any local decision affecting land use and development depends upon

17 consistency with the applicable general plan and its elements." (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of

18 Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal. 3d 553, 570.) Further, (1) City's zoning code and its interpretations of

19 the code must be consistent with its General Plan and be reasonable (Families Unafraid to Uphold

20 Rural El Dorado County v. Bd. of Supervisors (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1336); and (2) City's
decision to approve

21 this project must be supported by substantial evidence based on the entire
record. (Id. at 1338.) Further, a City may not interpret their local laws in whatever manner they
desire where General Plan or Code provisions at issue are "fundamental, mandatory and
22 unambiguous." (Id. at 1332.)

23 102.

24

25 City has violated the consistency doctrine, taking actions inconsistent with its own
General Plan in the following ways:

a.

26

27 Applying the CEQA categorical exemption to evade analysis of environmental

28 impacts. This is inconsistent with the City's Land Use, Public Safety, and Circulation Elements.

i. Land Use Element. Objective LU 1.2 requires the City to promote a

balance between visitor-oriented

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE and

AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 28 local-serving commercial

2 development. P1.2-2 requires that new visitor accommodations proposed]

t "shall be required to mitigate all environmental impacts." (Emphasis

† added.) Objective LU 3.2 requires the City to ensure new development
complements Calistoga's small town character and "minimizes impacts on

6 the environment". (Emphasis added.) Despite these mandates, City
applied a categorical exemption to this Projectinvolving new visitor
accommodations-bypassing thorough consideration of potential
environmental impacts despite the Project's location in the VHFHSZ
within a residential zoning district.
10
11 ii. Public Safety Element. The Public Safety Element notes that Foothill

12 Boulevard is characterized by "steep, wooded slopes…within the Very|

DP&F DICKENSON PEatman & FOGARTY uONDIOd1Og MD] ¡puopssafo4d V 13 High Fire Hazard Severity Zone..." (SAF-17.) Further, Goal SAF-3 of that

14 Element is to "[p]rotect lives and property from wildland fire hazard."

15 Implementing this Goal in relevant part is Objective SAF-3.1: "[p]lan new

16 developments with wildland fire hazards in mind." Policy 1 further states

17 "[p]lans for development in the Very High Fire Hazard Area shall bel

18 reviewed for their incorporation of design measures to reduce wildland fire

19 risk." Thus, despite clear General Plan requirements to consider wildfire

20 hazards, particularly in the VHFHSZ, City simply deferred to the Fire

21 Department to ensure compliance with certain state and local fire

22 regulations in construction of the Project. City acted inconsistently with the

23 General Plan by applying the categorical exemption and by not following

24 the SRA/VHFHSZ Fire Safe Regulations which were recently updated in
response to heightened wildfire risk.

25

26 iii. Circulation Element. Objective 1.4 of the Circulation Element states:

27 "[t]he City shall create and maintain a comprehensive and integrated

28 transportation network that provides safe, comfortable and convenient
travel, serving all types of users." City acted inconsistently with this

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 29

AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

an aggressive expansion of visitor - requirement by approving

2 accommodations in an already busy and unsafe intersection, withoutl

3 preparing a thorough traffic analysis of the Project's impacts, particularly

4 given its close proximity to another B&B and without consideration of

5 potential cumulative impacts.

6 b. Approval of : hotel in a Low-Density residential district in violation of the City's

7 General Plan - Land Use Element. (LU-12.)

8 C. Further, several objectives, policies, and actions of the City's Land Use Element
require the City to ensure commercial development is consistent with adjacent uses

10 (in particular lower-intensity uses), to promote a balance between visitor-oriented

11 and local-serving development, and to ensure commercial development does not

12 disturb Calistoga's quality of life and small-town character, including specifically
DP&F uopwaodi0g avl pouojssaoad V Al8VOOA 2 NVNLVAd'NOSNIXDICI 13 with respect to B&Bs. (See Objective LU 1.2 ("[p]romote a balance between

14 visitor-oriented and local-serving commercial development"), Policy P1.2-2

15 ("[n]ew visitor accommodations proposed in Calistoga shall be required to

16 environmental impacts"); Policy P1.2-4 ("[n]ew visitor mitigate all

17 accommodations development shall be designed, constructed and operated sO

18 as to be compatible with adjacent uses, particularly residences"), Action A1.2-

19 - ("[c]ontinue to regulate the expansion of bed-and-breakfast units to ensure an

20 appropriate mix of land uses and to retain the predominantly residential

21 character of established neighborhoods"); Objective LU 1.3 ("[e]nsure that

22 commercial and industrial development is designed, located and operated so as to

23 not disturb Calistoga's quality of life, and approved at a rate and scale that

24 retains Calistoga's small-town character"); Objective LU 3.1 ("[p]revent

25 development from occurring where the location or the physical or biological

26 characteristics of the site would make the land use inappropriate"); Policy 3.1-2

27 (*[n]ew development shall be designed so as to not adversely impact adjacent uses,

28 [in] particular those of lower intensities"); Policy 3.2-1 ("[n]ew development

30
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1

2 shall be designed to respect and enhance Calistoga's small-town rural characterl
and the natural environment") (Emphasis added).)

3 103. Approval of this hotel, or in the alternative B&B with maximum units allowable

4 by law and no pre-existing residential use, is clearly prioritizing over-intensification of

5 commercial visitor-oriented development project over the residential character of the surrounding

6 neighborhood, with minimal regard to adjacent lower-intensity residential uses or Calistoga's

7 small-town character.

8 104. In addition to inconsistencies with the General Plan, City's interpretation of its

9 zoning code is unreasonable and clearly in violation of law in the following ways:

10 a. Approval of a Project with an "accessory" B&B use in a residential zoning district

11

12 with no primary residential use in violation of CMC §§ 17.35.010(D) and
ALAVDO  A NVNLVEd 'NOSNINDICI A Professional Law Corporation 17.04.023, for the reasons discussed above;
DP&F 13
14 b. Adoption of a percentage use methodology contrary to the plain language of CMC

15 § 17.35.010(D) requiring comparison of the residential use to the commercial use,

16 not comparison of the commercial use to the property as a whole;

C.

17 Unreasonable and arbitrary calculation of B&B use under CMC § 17.35.010(D),

18 per the three methodologies offered by City Staff, for the reasons discussed above;

19 d. Violation of B&B spacing requirements under CMC § 17.35.040(c)(1). For the

20 reasons discussed above, Respondent's argument that Cottages can be expanded

21 despite violating spacing requirements is unreasonable because spacingl

22 requirements are distinct from height, setback, and coverage, which are distinct
concepts under the CMC;

23 e.

24 Violation of B&B requirements for findings required to approve maximum units
per CMC §§ 17.35.040(C) et. seq.;

25

26 f. Violation of requirements for use permit approvals per CMC §§ 17.40.030(D)(1)-
(3); and

27 g.

28 Failure to inspect facilities and forward reports to the Planning Commission before
approval in violation of CMC § 17.35.020(H).

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 31

AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 105. City also violated law when it failed to consider as part of the renewal hearings

2 issues related to the scope of the private driveway easement and CC&Rs. City failed to consider

3

4 whether undertaking the proposed project could be accomplished legally. Further the Project
implicates issues of commercial and emergency access, traffic, public safety, and commercial use

5 of the easement, which is relevant to, among other issues, the special circumstances required to

6 approve the maximum of ten units under the B&B Code.

7 106.

8 Respondents' failure to proceed as required by law and in the absence of
substantial evidence to support their decision is an abuse of discretion.

9 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

above. The Petitioner incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in the paragraphs

DP&F DICKENSON, PEATMAN & FOGARTY 12

noppaod40g AvT jouojss3[o4d V 13 108.

14 City violated the SRA/VHFHSZ Fire Safe Regulations by failing to notify the

15 Director of CAL FIRE of the Project which is located within the VHFHSZ, and by failing to

16 incorporate the applicable section of the SRA/VHFHSZ Fire Safe Regulations into the conditions|

17 of approval of the Project, as required by Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 §§ 1270.03(a) and (c)
respectively.

18 109.

19 City was advised of and had actual knowledge of the property's location in the
VHFHSZ prior to approval, but failed to abide by the applicable regulations.

20 110.

21 City's failure to proceed as required by law is an abuse of discretion. Petitioner

therefore seeks relief in the form set forth below.

22 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

23 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as follows:

27 Municipal Code, and the SRA/VHFHSZ Fire Safe Regulations in reviewing the Project;
