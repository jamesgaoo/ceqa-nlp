26 and Eddie Armando Torres (*Petitioners") petition this Court for a writ of mandate and declaratory
27 and injunctive relief directed to Respondents and Defendants City of Visalia, the Site Plan Review

28 Committee for the City of Visalia, City of Visalia Planning Commission and Paul Bernal

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 (collectively "Respondents" or "City") and Real Party in Interest 4 Creeks, Inc. ("Real Party" or

2 *Applicant"), and by this verified petition and complaint, allege as follows:

3 1. This action alleges violations of the California Environmental Quality Act, Public
Resources Code sections 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"), by the City regarding a project proposed and

5 being carried out by Real Party in Interest to construct the Shirk and Riggin Industrial Park, an

6 approximately 280 acre industrial park containing: (1) 3,422,950 square feet ("SF") of heavy

7 industrial uses; (2) 210,000 SF of light industrial uses; (3) a 6,900 SF convenience store; (4) two

8 drive-thru restaurants totaling 4,800 SF; and (5) a 4,500 SF car wash ("Project").

9 2. On May 4, 2022, the City's Site Plan Review Committee approved the Project,
10 establishing conditions and allowing it to proceed to apply for building permits and other approvals

11 without conducting any environmental review of the Project pursuant to CEQA, despite the likely
12 environmental impacts associated with the construction and operation of the 4,393,073 SF of
13 development proposed by the Project.

14 3. When Petitioners attempted to appeal the Site Plan Review Committee's decision to

15 the City's Planning Commission based on inconsistencies with CEQA, the City's General Plan and a

16 related mitigation measure, and the City's transportation impact assessment policy, the City rejected

17 their appeal, claiming that the Site Plan Review Committee's review of the Project was ministerial

18 and, therefore, not subject to CEQA. The City's rejection of Petitioners' appeal also claimed that the

19 project would "be subject to CEQA review in connection with future discretionary permits, approvals

20 and/or entitlements."

21 4. This action alleges that Respondents abused their discretion by rejecting Petitioners'

22 appeal of the Site Plan Review Committee's approval of the Project, thereby denying Petitioners the

23 opportunity to prepare and provide meaningful written and oral comments to the Planning
24 Commission on the Project regarding the Project's potential significant impacts on Petitioners and the
25 environment and inconsistencies with the City's requirements.

26 5. This action alleges that, independent of the Site Plan Review Committee's

27 discretionary authority over the Project, Respondents have violated CEQA by delaying
28 environmental review of the Project until after the Committee's approval of the Project even though

2

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 Respondents admit the Project will be subject to" future discretionary permits, approvals and/or

2 entitlements."

3 6. This action alleges in the alternative that Respondents have violated CEQA by

4 claiming that the Site Plan Review Committee's authority over the Project is ministerial despite the

5 Site Plan Review Committee's discretionary authority over the Project granted by the City's

6 municipal code, including the authority to "[a]pply requirements to a site to protect the public health,

7 safety and general welfare." (Visalia Muni. Code (*VMC**), § 17.28.020(B)(2).)

8 PARTIES

9 7. Petitioner and Plaintiff EDDIE ARMANDO TORRES is a resident of Visalia,

10 California. Mr. Torres frequently visits or passes through the area of the Project site. Mr. Torres is

11 interested in ensuring that the City and Real Party fully comply with CEQA to ensure that all

12 environmental impacts are mitigated to the maximum extent feasible. Mr. Torres is a member of

13 Laborers International Union of North America, Local Union 294.

14 8. Petitioner and Plaintiff LABORERS INTERNATIONAL UNION OF NORTH

15 AMERICA, LOCAL UNION 294 ("Local 294") is a labor organization that has more than 1,500

16 members residing in Tulare, Fresno, Madera and Kings County. Local 294 has more than 220

17 members who live in the City of Visalia. Local 294's purposes include advocating on behalf of its

18 members to ensure safe workplace environments; working to protect recreational opportunities for its

19 members to improve its members' quality of life when off the job; advocating to assure its members'

20 access to safe, healthful, productive, and aesthetically and culturally pleasing surroundings on and off

21 the job; promoting environmentally sustainable businesses and development projects on behalf of its

22 members, including providing comments raising environmental concerns and benefits on proposed

23 development projects; advocating for changes to proposed development projects that will help to

24 a achieve a balance between employment, the human population, and resource use to permit high

25 standards of living and a wide sharing of life's amenities by its members as well as the general

26 public; advocating for steps to preserve important historic, cultural, and natural aspects of our

27 national heritage, and maintain, wherever possible, an environment that supports diversity and variety

28 of individual choice; advocating on behalf of its members for programs, policies, and development

3

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 projects that promote not only good jobs but also healthy natural environment and working

2 environment, including advocating for changes to proposed projects and policies that, if adopted,

3 would reduce air, soil, and water pollution, minimize harm to wildlife, conserve wild places, reduce

4 traffic congestion, reduce global warming impacts, and assure compliance with applicable land use

5 ordinances; and working to attain the widest range of beneficial uses of the environment without

6 degradation, risk to health or safety, or other undesirable or unintended consequences.

7 9. Local 294, its members, and Mr. Torres have direct and beneficial interests in

8 Respondents' compliance with laws bearing upon approval of the Project. These interests will be

9 directly and adversely affected by the Project, which violates the law as set forth in this Petition. The

10 maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a substantial benefit on Petitioners and the

11 public by protecting Petitioners and the public from the environmental and other harms alleged below

12 and others that may exist but are unknown due to the lack of a full environmental analysis of the

13 Project.

14 10. Respondent and Defendant CITY OF VISALIA is the "lead agency" for the Project

15 for purposes of Public Resources Code section 21067, and has principal responsibility for conducting

16 environmental review for the Project and taking other actions necessary to comply CEQA.

17 11. Respondent and Defendant SITE PLAN REVIEW COMMITTEE FOR THE CITY

18 OF VISALIA is a committee established by the City of Visalia's Municipal Code §§ 17.28.010 -

19 17.28.120 and is ultimately responsible for reviewing and approving or denying Site Plan Review

20 permits for development projects within the City. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon

21 allege, that on or about May 4, 2022, the Site Plan Review Committee approved a site plan review

22 permit or otherwise authorized the Project to proceed.

23 12. Respondent and Defendant CITY OF VISALIA PLANNING COMMISSION is a

24 commission established by the City of Visalia Municipal Code Chapter 2.16 which is vested with all
25 of the powers and duties imposed upon planning commissions by general law of the State of

26 California. The Planning Commission is vested with a duty to hear appeals by any interested person

27 of decisions of the Site Plan Review § Committee. (VMC § 17.28.050.) The Planning Commission

28

4

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

failed to place on its agenda and hear Petitioners' appeal of the Site Plan Review Committee's

2 decision for the Project.

3 13. Respondent and Defendant PAUL BERNAL is the Interim Director/City Planner of

4 the City's Community Development Department. Mr. Bernal is responsible for facilitating the Site
Plan Review Committee. Mr. Bernal also manages the City's environmental review of Project's

6 under CEQA. On May 16, 2022, Mr. Bernal issued a decision to reject Petitioners' appeal of the

7 Committee's May 4, 2022 approval of the Project.

8 14. Real Party in Interest 4 CREEKS, INC. is a California corporation. 4 Creeks, Inc. is

9 the applicant for the Project.

10 15. Petitioners and Plaintiffs do not know the true names or capacities of the persons or

11 entities sued as Respondents DOES I through X, inclusive, nor of Real Parties in Interest ROES I

12 through X, inclusive, and therefore sue these respondents and real parties by their fictitious names.

13 Petitioners and plaintiffs will amend the Petition and Complaint to set forth the names and capacities

14 of the Doe defendants along with appropriate charging allegations when such information has been

15 ascertained.

16 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

17 16. Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 (alternatively section

18 1094.5) and Public Resources Code sections 21168.5 (alternatively section 21168) and 21168.9, this

19 Court has jurisdiction to issue writ of mandate to set aside Respondents' failure to process

20 Petitioners' appeal of the Site Plan Review Committee's approval and the City's decision to approve

21 the Site Plan Review Permit for the Project without first conducting a proper CEQA review. The

22 Court has jurisdiction to issue declaratory relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 1060 and

23 injunctive relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § § 525, et seq.

24 17. Venue is proper in this Court because this action challenges acts done by a public

25 agency, and the causes of action alleged in this Petition and Complaint arose in Tulare County.

26 Venue also is proper in this Court because the City is located in Tulare County.
27 18. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

28 21167.5 by serving on May 25, 2022 a written notice of Petitioners' intention to commence this

5

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

action against Respondents pursuant to CEQA. A copy of the written notice is attached hereto as

2 Exhibit A.

19. This action is timely filed within all applicable statutes of limitations, including those
set forth in Public Resources Code section 21167.

5 20. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

6 21167.6 by filing a notice of their election to prepare the record of administrative proceedings
relating to this action. A copy of the notice is attached hereto as Exhibit B.

8 21. Petitioners will comply with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

9 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 by sending a copy of this Petition and Complaint to

10 the California Attorney General within the required time period.

11 22. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this instant action

12 and have exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

13 23. Petitioners have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

14 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents set aside the City's

15 actions taken in violation of CEQA, to require Respondents to prepare an EIR or other legally

16 adequate CEQA document for the Project and to enjoin the City from approving the Project pending

17 completion of legally adequate CEQA review. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents'

18 decision will remain in violation of state law.

19 LEGAL BACKGROUND

20 City of Visalia Municipal Code

21 24. The Project's parcel is zoned Industrial ("I*). Warehousing is a permitted use in the a

22 Industrial zone. (VMC § 17.25.030, Table 17.25.030.) Combined office/warehouse-type buildings

23 (M45) is one of the uses "permitted by right" in the Industrial zone. (Id.; see VMC § 17.25.030(B)

24 l"A "P" means that the use is permitted by right in that zone"].) However, all of the permitted

25 industrial uses are qualified by the City's Site Plan Review permit process. "A site plan review permit

26 must be obtained for all development in an I-L or I zone, subject to the requirements and procedures

27 11 Chapter 17.28." (VMC § 17.22.040(C).)

28

6

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

25. Chapter 17.28 of the City's Municipal Code establishes the Site Plan Review
Committee and the requirements for the issuance of Site Plan Review Permits. "The purpose of the

3 site plan review permit iS to assure that developments, new and remodeled buildings and structures,

4 and improvements to land are reviewed to ensure substantial compliance with the general plan,

5 municipal code, policies, and improvement standards of the city." (VMC § 17.28.010.)

6 26. The Site Plan Review Permit provisions apply to, inter alia, "[n]ew commercial,

7 industrial and other non-residential structures or additions to existing commercial, industrial or other

8 non-residential structures." (VMC § 17.28.015(A)(2).)

9 27. The Site Plan Review Committee consists of "staff representatives of the engineering,
10 building, and planning divisions of the community development as well as the fire department...."

11 (VMC § 17.28.020.) The Site Plan Review Committee meets regularly each Wednesday at 9:00 a.m.
12 (VMC § 17.28.030(C).)

13 28. The VMC grants the following powers to the Site Plan Review Committee: "(1)

14 Review site plan review permit applications for consistency with the general plan, municipal code,

15 policies, regulations, and improvement standards of the city; (2) Apply requirements to a site to

16 protect the public health, safety and general welfare; (3) Require revisions to the site plan to bring it

17 into consistency with the General Plan and local ordinances; (4) Identify the city permits necessary to

18 construct the proposed project; (5) Require that the site plan be revised, and/or provide direction to

19 the project applicant be permitted to proceed to submit for the necessary city permits; or (6) Require

20 that the site plan be resubmitted with required revisions." (VMC § 17.28.020(B).)
21 29. The VMC also grants the Site Plan Review Committee the authority to determine

22 whether or not to request various right-of-way dedications, street improvements and grading based on
23 a Project's addition of traffic to the local street. Section 17.28.080 provides that "[b]ecause of

24 changes that may occur in a local neighborhood due to increased vehicular traffic generated by
25 facilities requiring a site plan review permit, and upon the principle that such development should be
26 required to provide street dedications and improvements proportionate to such increased vehicular

27 traffic, the following dedications and improvements may be deemed necessary by the site plan review
28 committee and may be required as a revision to any site plan." (VMC § 17.28.080.)

7

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 30. The VMC requires any applicant to submit a site a plan and a site plan review

2 application form. (VMC § 17.28.030.) When a site plan review application and twenty copies of the

3 proposed site plan are submitted to the Committee by Thursday at 4:00 p.m., the application is heard

4 by the Committee at the following Wednesday morning meeting, unless otherwise extended by the

5 Committee. (VMC § 17.28.030(C).)

6 31. The VMC provides that "[w]ithin thirty (30) working days after submission, the site

7 plan review committee shall provide, in writing to the applicant, either to proceed with applying for

8 necessary city permits, either with or without required revisions, or require resubmittal of the site

9 plan review and identify required revisions." (VMC § 17.28.040(B).) "The site plan review

10 committee shall consider each project's consistency with current city ordinances and whether it will

11 affect the public health, safety and general welfare." (Id.)

12 32. The VMC provides a broad right to appeal any action or determinations of the Site

13 Plan Review Committee to the City's Planning Commission. "The applicant or any interested person
14 may appeal a decision of the site plan review committee to the planning commission, setting forth the

15 reason for such appeal to the commission." (VMC § 17.28.050.) "Such appeal shall be filed with the
16 city planner in writing with applicable fees, within ten (10) days after notification of such decision."

17 (Id.) The current fee for filing an appeal of a Site Plan Review decision is $552.00. Once filed, "[t]he
18 appeal shall be placed on the agenda of the commission's next regular meeting[,]" unless the appeal

19 was filed within five days of the next Planning Commission, in which case "the appeal shall be

20 placed on the agenda of the commission's second regular meeting following the filing of the appeal."
21 (Id.) In furtherance of the appeal, the Planning Commission " shall review the site plan and shall

22 uphold or revise the decision of the site plan review, based on the findings set forth in

23 Section 17.28.040[,]" including whether the project "will affect the public health, safety, and general

24 welfare." (Id.; VMC § 17.28.040(B).) An appellant may then appeal the Planning Commission's
25 decision to the City Council. (VMC § 17.28.050.)

26 33. The VMC does not provide any definition of the term "interested party." The VMC
27 contains no prerequisite that an interested person must make comments to the Site Plan Review

28 Committee or otherwise appear before the Committee before filing an appeal pursuant to VMC

8

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

17.28.050. The VMC does not provide any administrative appeal procedure of any action by the

2 Planning Director to unilaterally reject a timely filed appeal by a person claiming to be interested in a
decision of the Site Plan Review Committee.

34. The VMC does not provide any administrative appeal process for a determination by
the City's environmental planner that a proposed project is ministerial and not subject to CEQA

6 either to the Planning Commission, the City Council or any other city official or department.

7 The California Environmental Quality Act

8 35. CEQA mandates that "the long-term protection of the environment….shall be the

9 guiding criterion in public decisions" throughout California. (Pub. Res. Code 21001(d).) The

10 foremost principle under CEQA is that it is to be "interpreted in such a manner as to afford the fullest

11 possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language."

12 (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal. 3d 553, 563-64.) An agency's action
13 violates CEQA if it "thwarts the statutory goals" of "informed decisionmaking" and "informed public

14 participation." (Kings Co. Farm Bur. v. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 712.)

15 36. To achieve its objectives of environmental protection, CEQA has a three-tiered

16 structure. (14 CCR § 15002(k; Comm. to Save Hollywoodland v. City of Los Angeles (2008) 161

17 Cal.App.4th 1168, 1185-86) First, if a project falls into an exempt category, no further agency
18 evaluation is required. (Id.) Second, if there is a possibility the project will have a significant effect
19 on the environment, the agency must perform a threshold initial study. (Id.; 14 CCR § 15063(a).) If
20 the study indicates that there is no substantial evidence that the project may cause a significant effect
21 on the environment the agency may issue a negative declaration. (Id., 14 CCR § § 15063(b)(2),
22 15070) Finally, if the project will have a significant effect on the environment, an environmental
23 impact report ("EIR") is required. (Id.)

24 37. Exemptions to CEQA are narrowly construed and "[e]xemption categories are not to
25 be expanded beyond the reasonable scope of their statutory language." (Mountain Lion Found. v.

26 Fish & Game Com. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 125)

27

28

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 38. CEQA applies only to "discretionary projects proposed to be carried out or approved

2 by public agencies." (Pub. Res. Code § 21080(a).) Section 15357 of the CEQA Guidelines defines

3 "discretionary projects" as:

4 [A] project which requires the exercise of judgment or deliberation when the public

5 agency or body decides to approve or disapprove : particular activity, as distinguished from situations where the public agency or body merely has to determine whether there
6 has been conformity with applicable statutes, ordinances, or regulations.

7 (14 CCR §15357.) Section 15369 of the CEQA Guidelines defines "ministerial" as:

8 [D]escrib[ing] a governmental decision involving little or no personal judgment by the
9 public official as to the wisdom or manner of carrying out the project. The public official merely applies the law to the facts as presented but uses no special discretion
10 or judgment in reaching a decision. A ministerial decision involves only the use of fixed

11 standards or objective measurements, and the public official cannot use personal, subjective judgment in deciding whether or how the project should be carried out.
12 (14 CCR § 15369.) Common examples of ministerial permits include automobile registration, dog
13 licenses, and marriage licenses. (Id.) A building permit iS ministerial if it "limits the public official to
14
determining whether the zoning allows the structure the structure would meet the strength
15
requirements ... and applicant has paid his fee." (Id.)
16
39. If a project's approval involves both discretionary and ministerial acts, the project is
17
subject to CEQA review. (14 CCR § 15258(d).)
18
40. The CEQA Guidelines further explain that "[w]hether an agency has discretionary or
19 ministerial controls over a project depends on the authority granted by the law providing the controls 20
over the activity. Similar projects may be subject to discretionary controls in one city or county and
21 only ministerial controls in another." (14 CCR § 15002(i)(2).) "The statutory distinction between
22 discretionary and purely ministerial projects implicitly recognizes that unless a public agency can
23
a shape the project in a way that would respond to concerns raised in an EIR, or its functional
24 equivalent, environmental review would be a meaningless exercise." (Mountain a Lion Found., supra,
25
16 Cal.4th at 117.)
26
41. The Courts apply a "functional" test for distinguishing ministerial from discretionary
27
decisions. (Friends of Westwood, Inc. V. City of Los Angeles (1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 259, 272.) That
28

10

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 test examines whether the agency has the power to shape the project in ways that are responsive to

2 environmental concerns. (Id. at 267; Mountain Lion Found., supra, 16 Cal.4th at 117.) Under this

3 functional test, a project qualifies as ministerial "when a private party can legally compel approval

4 without any changes in the design of its project which might alleviate adverse environmental
5 consequences."(Friends of Westwood, supra, 191 Cal.App.3d at 267; accord, Miller v. City of

6 Hermosa Beach (1993) 13 Cal. App. 4th 1118, 1141-42.) Discretion exists where the approving

7 agency can impose "reasonable conditions" based on "professional judgment." (Natural Res. Def.

8 Council v. Arcata (1976) 59 Cal.App.3d 959, 971);

9 42. It is sufficient that an agency possess discretionary authority, even if it chooses not to

10 exercise that authority. "[W]here the agency possesses enough authority (that is, discretion) to deny

11 or modify the proposed project on the basis of environment consequences the EIR might conceivably

12 uncover, the permit process is discretionary' within the meaning of CEQA." (Friends of Westwood,

13 supra, 191 Cal.App.3d at 272.)

14 43. To determine whether the City has discretionary authority, the Court must look to the

15 plain language of the City's municipal code. "Whether an agency has discretionary or ministerial

16 controls over a project depends on the authority granted by the law providing the controls over the

17 activity. Similar projects may be subject to discretionary controls in one city or county and only

18 ministerial controls in another." (CEQA Guidelines § 15002(i)(2).) In construing a statute or an

19 ordinance, the courts look first to the language of the provision itself. (Friends of Juana Briones

20 House v. City of Palo Alto (2010) 190 Cal.App.4th 286, 304.) If the language "is clear and

21 unambiguous our inquiry ends. There is no need for judicial construction and a court may not indulge

22 in it." (Id.)

23 44. Where, as here, no public hearing was held for the CEQA determination, legal

24 challenges are made pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure 1085 (traditional mandamus) and Public

25 Resources Code section 21168.5. (San Lorenzo Valley Com. Advocates v. San Lorenzo Valley Unif.

26 Sch. Dist. (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 1356, 1381.) The court must determine if there was a "prejudicial a

27 abuse of discretion" by the agency including a failure to proceed "in a manner required by law."

28 (Western States Petroleum Assn. V. Super. Ct. (1995) 9 Cal.4th 559, 568.) Courts owe no deference to

11

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 agencies where the law has been misapplied and "an agency's use of an erroneous legal standard

2 constitutes a failure to proceed a in a manner required by law. The interpretation and applicability of a

3 statute is a question of law requiring an independent determination by the reviewing court." (East
Pen. Educ. Coun. v. Palos Verde Unif. Sch. Dist. (1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 155, 165.) "The legal
5 determination of whether an approval is exempt from CEQA review as a ministerial action is subject

6 to our de novo review." (Friends of Juana Briones, supra, 190 Cal.App.4th at 303.)

7 45. Environmental review of a project must occur "[b]efore granting any approval of a

8 project subject to CEQA[,]" including both ministerial and discretionary approvals. (14 CCR §

9 15004(c); PRC § 21003(a); see also Orinda Assn. v. Bd. of Supervisors (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 1145,

10 1171 [holding that unconditional "demolition permit could not be issued until the entire CEQA

11 process was completed and the overall Project lawfully approved"].) Prior to completing its review of

12 a project pursuant to CEQA, "agencies must not 'take any action' that significantly furthers a project

13 a "in a manner that forecloses alternatives or mitigation measures that would ordinarily be part of
14 CEQA review of that public project.' (Save Tara v. City of West Hollywood (2008) 45 Cal.4th 116,

15 138 [quoting 14 CCR § 15004(b)(2)(B)].)

16 STATEMENT OF FACTS

17 46. On or about April 23, 2021, the City posted the Site Plan Review Agenda for the April

18 28, 2021 meeting of the Site Plan Review Committee ("SPR Committee") at which the SPR

19 Committee would consider the Project.

20 47. On April 27, 2021, Petitioners submitted a written comment to the SPR Committee.

21 ("April 27 Comment').

22 48. The April 27 Comment noted that the Project should be subject to CEQA because the
23 City's Municipal Code grants the SPR Committee discretion over the Project, including the authority
24 to "[a]pply requirements to a site to protect the public health, safety and general welfare." (VMC §
25 17.28.020(B)(2).)

26 49. The April 27 Comment noted that any reliance on the City's 2014 EIR for its General

27 Plan Update (*2014 General Plan EIR") was misplaced because the 2014 General Plan EIR explicitly

28 stated that it should not be used for the approval of individual projects undertaken subsequent to the
12

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 Plan's adoption and required site-specific environmental review of the Project's air quality, noise and

2 wildlife impacts.

3 50. The April 27 Comment noted that the City failed to prepare a Local Transportation

4 Analysis ("LTA") or CEQA Transportation Impact Analysis (*VMT Analysis") for the Project as

5 required by the City's "Procedures For Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) (Updated March 2021)."

6 51. On April 28, 2021, the SPR Committee directed the Project's applicant to resubmit its

7 application.

8 52. On or about September 10, 2021, the City posted the Site Plan Review Agenda for the

9 September 15, 2021 meeting of the SPR Committee at which the SPR Committee would again

10 consider the Project.

11 53. On September 14, 2021, Petitioners submitted a written comment to the SPR

12 Committee ("September 14 Comment").

13 54. The September 14 Comment noted that new mitigation measures have become

14 available and/or feasible since certification of the 2014 General Plan EIR to address air quality

15 impacts from warehouse projects, including but not limited to mitigation measures identified by the

16 California Attorney General in California Department of Justice's "Warehouse Projects: Best

17 Practices and Mitigation Measures to Comply with the California Environmental Quality Act." The

18 September 14 Comment noted that the availability of these new mitigation measures requires that the

19 City update the 2014 General Plan EIR as required under CEQA Guidelines section 15162, prior to

20 the SPR Committee approving the Project's Site Plan Review permit.

21 55. On September 15, 2021, the SPR Committee again directed the Project's applicant to
22 resubmit the application.

23 56. On or about April 29, 2022, the City posted the Site Plan Review Agenda for the May

24 4, 2022 meeting of the SPR Committee at which the SPR Committee would again consider the

25 Project.

26 57. On May 3, 2022, Petitioners submitted a written comment to the SPR Committee

27 ("May 3 Comment").

28

13

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 58. The May 3 Comment included an analysis of the Project by expert wildlife biologist

2 Dr. Shawn Smallwood, Ph.D. Based on a site visit and available wildlife databases, Dr. Smallwood

3 concluded that at least 76 special-status species either were present or likely to be present on the

4 Project site. Dr. Smallwood concluded that the Project posed potential significant impacts to these

5 species due to the direct destruction of existing habitat, impacts on wildlife movement, and collisions

6 between wildlife and vehicles.

7 59. On May 4, 2022, the SPR Committee directed the Project's applicant to Revise and

8 Proceed.

9 60. On May 12, 2022, Petitioners submitted an appeal ("Petitioners' Appeal") to the City

10 to appeal the SPR Committee's May 4, 2022 decision approving the Project to the City's Planning

11 Commission for the reasons stated in Petitioner's written comments on April 27, 2021, September 14,

12 2021, and May 3, 2022. Petitioners submitted the required appeal fee with their appeal.

13 61. Petitioners' Appeal included an analysis of the Project by air quality experts Paul

14 Rosenfeld, Ph.D., and Matt Hagemann, P.G., C.Hg., of the Soil/Water/Air Protection Enterprise

15 ("SWAPE"). SWAPE concluded that construction of the Project would result in significant ROG

16 emissions exceeding CEQA significance thresholds established by the San Joaquin Valley Air

17 Pollution Control District ("SJVAPCD"), indicating a potentially significant air quality impact.

18 SWAPE also concluded that operation of the Project would result in significant ROG, NOx, and

19 PM10 emissions exceeding SJVAPCD's CEQA thresholds. SWAPE also noted that a health risk

20 I assessment should be conducted for the Project in accordance with guidance from the California

21 Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment. SWAPE also concluded that the Project's

22 amortized construction-related greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions in combination with the Project's

23 operational GHG emissions need to be reduced by 29% in order to comply with thresholds

24 established by SJVAPCD.

25 62. On May 16, 2022, Respondent Paul Bernal issued a letter to Petitioners rejecting

26 Petitioners' Appeal ("City's Appeal Rejection"). The City's Appeal Rejection stated that Petitioners'

27 appeal was rejected "on the grounds that it [did] a not describe a City standard, policy, or ordinance

28 that was misapplied by City staff in making a determination of the Site Plan Review Permit." The

14

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

City's Appeal Rejection claimed that the SPR Committee's decision was not discretionary. The
City's Appeal Rejection also claimed that "all impacts associated with [the Project] will be subject to

3 CEQA review in connection with future discretionary permits, approvals and/or entitlements as noted

4 in the Planning Division's comments for this project." The City's Appeal Rejection indicated that the
City would be returning Petitioners' appeal fee.

6 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

7 (Code of Civil Procedure § 1085 Writ of Mandate; abuse of discretion in rejecting
administrative appeal of Site Plan Review Permit)

63. All of the above paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference as if set forth again in
full.

10 64. Respondent Bernal, in his capacity as Director of the City's Community Development
11 Department, and Respondent Planning Commission violated their ministerial duty to accept
12 Petitioners' appeal of the Site Plan Review Permit for the Project and to place the appeal on the
13 Planning Commission agenda as specified by VMC § 17.28.050 and for Respondent Planning
14 Commission to hear the appeal.
15 65. Respondent Bernal, in his capacity as Director of the City's Community Development
16 Department, further committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion when, via correspondence dated May
17 16, 2022, he rejected Petitioners' appeal of the Site Plan Review Committee's actions regarding the
18 Project. Respondent Bernal erred as a matter of law by incorrectly inferring that, in order to be
19 accepted, an appeal pursuant to VMC § 17.28.050 was required to "describe a City standard, policy,
20 or ordinance that was misapplied by City staff in making a determination of the Site Plan Review
21 Permit." Even assuming there was such a requirement, Respondent Bernal further erred in
22 determining that Petitioners did not cite any City standard, policy, or ordinance that had been violated
23 despite the alleged inconsistencies with the SPR Committee's ordinance, the TIA Procedures,
24 General Plan Policy AQ-P-9, and the 2014 General Plan EIR.
25 66. Petitioners are prejudiced by Respondent Bernal's arbitrary refusal to allow Petitioners /
26 to present their appeal to the City's Planning Commission and Respondent Planning Commission's
27 failure to place the appeal on its agenda and hear the appeal. Petitioners met each of the prerequisites
28

15

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

for filing an appeal of the decision of the SPR Committee set forth at VMC § 17.28.050. Petitioners

2 were denied the opportunity to prepare and provide meaningful written and oral comments to the

3 Planning Commission on the Project regarding the Project's potential significant impacts on

4 Petitioners and the environment and its consistency with the City's traffic analysis requirements.
67. For these reasons, the Court a should issue a writ of mandate pursuant to Code of Civil

6 Procedure § 1085 mandating that Respondents process Petitioners' appeal by placing it on the
Planning Commission's agenda and conduct the necessary review of the appeal and staying the City's
approvals of the Project pending the completion of the City's administrative appeal proceedings.
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

10 (Code of Civil Procedure § 1085 Writ of Mandate; CEQA § PRC §§ 21168.5 - abuse of discretion in improper delay of environmental review)
11
68.
12 All of the above paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference as if set forth again in
full.
13
69.
14 Respondents abused their discretion by failing to conduct environmental review of the

15 Project prior to the SPR Committee's approval of the Project.

70. The City's May 16, 2022 Appeal Rejection claimed that "all impacts associated with
16

17 [the Project] will be subject to CEQA review in connection with future discretionary permits,

18 approvals and/or entitlements as noted in the Planning Division's comments for this project."

71.
19 As the City's May 16, 2022 Appeal Rejection admitted, approval of the Project

20 involves discretionary permits, approvals and/or entitlements. As such, the Project is subject to
CEQA review. (14 CCR § 15258(d).)
21
72.
22 Because the Project involves discretionary permits, approvals and/or entitlements and

23 is thereby subject to CEQA, Respondents were prohibited from taking any action on the Project "in a

24 manner that forecloses alternatives or mitigation measures that would ordinarily be part of CEQA

25 review of that public project." (Save Tara V. City of West Hollywood (2008) 45 Cal.4th 116, 138
[quoting 14 CCR § 15004(b)(2)(B)].) The City's environmental review of the Project had to occur
26

27 "[b]efore granting any approval of a project subject to CEQA[,]" including both ministerial and

28 discretionary approvals.

16

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 73. The SPR Committee's approval of the Project, which approved the Project's site plans

2 and allowed the applicant to proceed to apply for building permits and other necessary permits, was

3 an approval of the Project and/or it foreclosed Respondents' ability to consider alternatives or

4 mitigation measures.

5 74. Due to the fact that approval of the Project involves discretionary permits, approvals

6 and/or entitlements and is thereby subject to CEQA, this Court should issue a writ of mandate a
directing Respondents to vacate the SPR Committee's approval of the Project and to conduct CEQA
review of the Project prior to any future consideration of the Project by the Committee.
THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

10 (Code of Civil Procedure § 1085 Writ of Mandate; CEQA § PRC §§ 21168.5 - in the alternative, abuse of discretion in claiming ministerial exemption to CEQA)
11
75.
12 All of the above paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference as if set forth again in
full.
13
76.
14 Respondents violated CEQA by failing to conduct any environmental review of the

15 I construction and operation of Real Parties in Interest's proposed industrial park prior to issuing a Site

16 Plan Review Permit and allowing the Project to proceed to apply for building permits on May 4,
2022.
17
77.
18 Real Parties in Interest's proposed industrial park is a project as that term is defined by
CEQA.
19
78. Petitioners allege that the Respondents abused their discretion and failed to act in the 20
manner required by law in violation of CEQA and Code Civ. Proc. § 1085 by claiming that the Site 21

22 Plan Review Committee's authority over the project is ministerial and exempt from CEQA.

23 Respondents' failure to conduct environmental review of the Project violated CEQA, inter alia,

24 because (1) the Project is not ministerial and therefore the exemption was improper and (2) the City

25 erroneously completed no initial study and made no effort pursuant to CEQA to characterize any

26 potentially significant environmental impacts, including traffic, air pollution, hazardous materials,

27 wildlife impacts, cumulative impacts, growth inducing impacts, or land use impacts of the Project.

28

17

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 79. Respondents abused their discretion and failed to act in the manner required by law by

2 failing to conduct any environmental review under CEQA in conjunction with the Project. For these

3 reasons, the Court should issue writ of mandate vacating the approvals of the Project and directing

4 the City to comply with CEQA.

5 PRAYER

6 WHEREFORE, Petitioners and Plaintiffs pray that the Court:
1. Issue a declaratory judgment declaring that:

8 a. Respondents' failed their ministerial duty to place Petitioners' appeal of the Site
Plan Review Committee's decision on the Planning Commission's agenda and for
10 the Planning Commission to hear the appeal;
11 b. Respondents' approval of the Project is null and void and contrary to law;
12
C. Respondents violated CEQA by failing to conduct CEQA review of the Project
13 prior to the Site Plan Review Committee's May 4. 2022 approval of the Project; 14
d. The Site Plan Review Committee's approval of the Project is a discretionary action 15
subject to the requirements of CEQA; 16

e. Respondents violated CEQA by failing to prepare an initial study and an 17
appropriate environmental review document for the Project.; 18
2. 19 Issue a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents and Real Party in Interest to

20 suspend all activity in furtherance of the Project and to refrain from taking or

21 authorizing any activities in furtherance of the Project, including the issuance of any
22 building or grading permits, unless and until Respondents comply fully with the City's
88008 appeal procedures and CEQA;

3. Issue a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents to set aside any and all
approvals of the Project, including but not limited to the Site Plan Review Permit and
any other decision to proceed, unless and until Respondents have prepared, circulated,
and considered a legally adequate CEQA document prior to any subsequent approval
28 action.

18

4. Issue a preliminary and permanent injunction staying the effect of Respondents'
approval of the Project;

6. Award attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §1021.5 and any other
applicable provisions of law; and

7. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Re: Notice of Intent to File Suit Under the California Environmental Quality Act
Regarding the Shirk & Riggin Industrial Park (Site Plan No. SPR21074)
Dear Mayor Nelson, Mr. Bernal, Ms. Caviglia, Mr. Richardson and Ms. Baumeister:
am writing on behalf of Laborers International Union of North America, Local Union
294 and Eddie Armando Torres (*Petitioners") regarding the Revise and Proceed decision issued by the Site Plan Review Committee ("SPR Committee") on May 12, 2022 for the Shirk & Riggin Industrial Park (Site Plan No. SPR21074) ("Project") and the City's subsequent May 16, 2022 rejection of Petitioners' appeal of the SPR Committee decision to the Planning Commission.

The May 16, 2022 rejection letter from Mr. Bernal asserts that Petitioners' appeal "fails to identify any City standard, policy or ordinance that was misapplied by City staff in making the Site Plan Review Determinations." On the contrary, the appeal identifies the City's Code provisions granting discretionary authority to the Site Plan Review Committee to condition the Project in order to protect the public health, safety and general welfare. See VMC § 17.28.020(B); VMC 17.28.040(B). The appeal submits expert comments identifying the air

quality and wildlife impacts from the Project which will adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. Because the City has discretion to mitigate the Project's effects on the public health, safety and general welfare, it is a project under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). By failing to prepare any document reviewing the Project pursuant to CEQA, the City is violating that important environmental statute.
Nor was the appeal confined to this CEQA violation. The appeal also identifies General Plan Policy AQ-P-9 as mitigation of the significant and unavoidable impacts the City identified in the City's 2014 General Plan Environmental Impact Report (*2014 General Plan EIR") from the construction and operation of development projects within the City. 2014 General Plan EIR, pp. 3.3-24, 3.3-26. General Plan Policy AQ-P-9 requires that the City:
Continue to mitigate short-term construction impacts and long-term stationary source impacts on air quality on a case-by-case basis and continue to assess air
quality impacts through environmental review. Require developers to implement Best Management Practices (BMPs) to reduce air pollutant emissions associated with the construction and operation of development projects.
2014 General Plan EIR, p. 3.3-26. See also id., p. 3.3-28. The environmental review of each project may or may not be pursuant to CEQA but, in either case, "would evaluate project-specific impacts." Id., p. 3.3-24. In processing the current Project, the City has failed to conduct the necessary environmental review of the Project's air quality impacts prior to approving the Project in violation of General Plan Policy AQ-P-9 and the 2014 General Plan EIR mitigation.
The appeal also sought review of the City's failure to require, prior to approving the Project, the preparation of a Local Transportation Analysis ("LTA") as well as a CEQA Transportation Impact Analysis (*TIA"), both of which are required by the City's "Procedures For Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) (Updated March 2021)." Contrary to your rejection letter, the LTA is required regardless of whether there is review under CEQA. However, because CEQA is triggered, a TIA is required as well. The SPR Committee, and thus the City, have arbitrarily ignored the City's Procedures while proceeding to approve the Project.
Lastly, the appeal cites to the 2014 General Plan EIR's admitted lack of mitigation measures to address unavoidable air quality impacts at the time and the subsequent development and feasibility of a long list of mitigation measures now available to be applied to warehouses and distribution centers, most of which measures
are aimed at mitigating air quality impacts from such projects. Rather than require these many available mitigation measures, the City continues to rely on the 2014 General Plan EIR's now outdated assertion that there are no additional mitigation measures to address
construction and operation emissions of ozone precursors, particulate matter, and other pollutants. The California Attorney General has compiled the many, more recent mitigation measures that are now available. The SPR Committee's failure to act on incorporating these mitigation measures into the Project, and your rejection of the appeal,

Notice of Intent to File CEQA Suit Shirk & Riggin Industrial Park (Site Plan No. SPR21074)
May 25, 2022
Page 3 of 4

is new significant information that requires the City to reopen its 2014 General Plan EIR
and prepare a supplemental EIR that reviews and incorporates these many new feasible mitigation measures for distribution Projects.
In addition, Mr. Bernal's rejection letter claimed that "all impacts associated with SRP No. 21-074 will be subject to CEQA review in connection with future discretionary permits, approvals and/or entitlements." CEQA is clear that if a project's approval involves both discretionary and ministerial acts, the project is subject to CEQA review. (14 CCR § 15258(d).) When a project is subject to CEQA review, "agencies must not 'take any action' that significantly furthers a project 'in a manner that forecloses alternatives or mitigation measures that would ordinarily be part of CEQA review of that public project."* (Save Tara v. City of West Hollywood (2008) 45 Cal.4th 116, 138 [citing 14 CCR § 15004(b)(2)(B)].) Here, because the Project involves future discretionary decisions, the City was required to conduct CEQA review before committing the City to a course of action by approving the Project's Site Review Permit.
Please take notice, pursuant to Public Resources Code ("PRC") section 21167.5 and Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, that Petitioners intend to file a Verified Petition for
Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (*Petition"), under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), PRC §21000 et seq., against Respondents and Defendants City of Visalia, the Site Plan Review Committee for the City of Visalia, and, in his official capacity, Paul Bernal ("Respondents") in the Superior Court for the County of Tulare, challenging the SPR Committee's May 12, 2022 decision for Respondents' failure to conduct any environmental review pursuant to CEQA as well as its failure to abide by the City's prior mitigation measures, environmental review policy, and transportation review
requirements.

The Petition being filed will request, inter alia, that the Court grant the following relief:

1. Issue declaratory judgment declaring that Respondents violated the Visalia Municipal Code by summarily rejecting Petitioners' appeal of the SPR Committee's May 12, 2022 decision to the Planning Commission;
2. Issue a declaratory judgment declaring that Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law by failing to conduct a project-specific environmental review of the Project's construction and operational air quality impacts as
required by the 2014 General Plan EIR and General Plan Policy AQ-P-9;
3. Issue a declaratory judgment declaring that Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law by approving the Project's Site Review Permit prior to conducting environmental review under CEQA;
4. Issue declaratory judgment declaring that Respondents violated the Visalia Municipal Code by failing to apply the City's Procedures For Traffic Impact

5. Analysis ("TIA Procedures") to the Project prior to its approval; Issue declaratory judgment declaring that Respondents retained discretionary authority over the Project and thereby failed to proceed in the manner required by law by failing to subject the Project to environmental review under CEQA;
6. Issue declaratory judgment declaring that any reliance by Respondents on the

environmental impact report certified for the City's General Plan in 2014 (*2014
General Plan EIR") is improper under CEQA due to the availability of mitigation measures that are now feasible and/or different from the mitigation measures
identified in the 2014 General Plan EIR;
7. Issue a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents to set aside any and all
approvals of the Project, including but not limited to the Site Plan Review and any other decision to proceed, unless and until Respondents have complied with the TIA Procedures prior to any subsequent approval action;
8. Issue a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents to set aside any and all approvals of the Project, including but not limited to the Site Plan Review and any other decision to proceed, unless and until Respondents have prepared, circulated,
and considered a legally adequate CEQA document prior to any subsequent
approval action;
9. Issue a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents and Real Party in Interest to suspend all activity in furtherance of the Project and to refrain from taking or authorizing any activities in furtherance of the Project, including the issuance of any building or grading permits, unless and until Petitioners' appeal to the Planning Commission is completed;
10. Issue a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents and Real Party in Interest to suspend all activity in furtherance of the Project and to refrain from taking or authorizing any activities in furtherance of the Project, including the issuance of any building or grading permits, unless and until Respondents comply
fully with CEQA;
11. Issue a preliminary and permanent injunction staying the effect of Respondents' approval of the Project;
12. Award costs of suit;
13. Award attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §1021.5 and any other applicable provisions of law; and
14. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
