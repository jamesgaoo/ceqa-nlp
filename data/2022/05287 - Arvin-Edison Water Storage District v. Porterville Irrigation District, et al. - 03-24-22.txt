PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1. By this action, Petitioner and Plaintiff Arvin-Edison Water Storage District ("Petitioner"

2 or "AEWSD") challenges approval by the Porterville Irrigation District ("PID") of the Jones

3 Corner/Burns/Los Robles Water Banks Project ("Project"), including PID's reliance on an inadequate

4 and incomplete Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration ("IS/MND") and PID's failure to prepare

5 an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the Project.

6 2. PID's approval of the Project was contrary to the California Environmental Quality Act
7 ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq., the CEQA Guidelines, Title 14, California
8 Code of Regulations section 15000, et seq., and plain common sense. Among other things, PID has

9 violated CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines by failing to (a) provide an accurate, stable, and finite
10 description of the Project, (b) properly evaluate potential water quality and subsidence impacts, (c)
11 develop adequate mitigation and monitoring measures, (d) recirculate its analyses to allow affected
KAPLAN KIRSCH & ROCKWELL LLP 12
+OI+6 VO 'OOSIONVAJ NVS 0167 ALINS 'IAIALS HWOSNVS ENO parties to review and comment on significant new information and substantial revisions, and (e) prepare
13 an EIR. The PID Board of Directors has compounded these failures through its procedural mistakes and
14 its failure to make required findings supported by substantial evidence.
15 3. Accordingly, this Court should find and determine that the IS/MND prepared for the
16 Project fails to satisfy the requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines and PID's purported
17 approval of the Project is invalid and void, and direct PID to fully comply with applicable law before
18
taking any further steps to implement or re-approve the Project.
19
PARTIES
20
4. Plaintiff and Petitioner AEWSD is a public entity formed and existing pursuant to the 21

22 California Water Storage District Law, Water Code § 39000 et § seq. AEWSD is authorized to - and

23 hereby does - bring this action on behalf of itself and the landowners and water users within its

24 boundaries, which include approximately 132,000 acres of mostly prime agricultural farmland in Kern

25 County. AEWSD was organized in 1942 for the express purpose of contracting with the United States

26 for water service from the Central Valley Project ("CVP"), among other things. AEWSD is a Friant

27 Division CVP contractor with a permanent contract for 40,000 acre-feet ("AF") of Class 1 water and

28 311,675 2 AF of Class 2 water. It receives that water from Millerton Lake via the Friant-Kern Canal

2

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

(*FKC"). The FKC's conveyance capacity and water quality conditions are thus of critical importance

2 to AEWSD.

3 5. Respondent and Defendant PID served as lead agency for the Project pursuant to CEQA.

4 AEWSD is informed and believes that PID is a public entity formed and existing pursuant to the

5 California Irrigation District Law, Water Code § 20500 et seq., which may sue and be sued.

6 6. Respondent and Defendant PORTERVILLE IRRIGATION DISTRICT BOARD OF
7 DIRECTORS (the "Board") serves as the governing body of PID. The Board purported to approve the
8 Project at its February 15, 2022, meeting.
9 7. Defendants and Respondents, and each of them, have authority to respond to any order of
10 this Court regarding the Project, the IS/MND, and/or PID's obligations under CEQA.
11 8. AEWSD does not know the true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate,
KAPLAN KIRSCH & ROCKWELL LLP 12
+O1P6 VO 'OOSIONVA  NVS 0167 ALINS 'IAIALS HWOSNVS ENO associate or otherwise, of Defendant and Respondent DOEs through 50, inclusive, and therefore sues
13 said parties under fictitious names.
14 9. AEWSD is informed and believes that Real Party in Interest HOMER, LLC applied to
15 PID for approval of the Project and seeks to develop and operate the Project. PID's Notice of
16 Determination for the Project (the "NOD") identifies Homer, LLC as the "Project Applicant."
17 10. AEWSD is informed and believes that Homer, LLC has authority to respond to any order
18
of this Court regarding the Project, including orders for preliminary or interim relief.
19
11.
20 AEWSD does not know the true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate,

21 associate or otherwise, of Defendant and Respondent DOEs 51 through 100, inclusive, and therefore

22 sues said parties under fictitious names.

23 STANDING
24 12. AEWSD has a direct and beneficial interest in the Project and in PID's compliance with
25 CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines because the Project directly and adversely affects AEWSD's
26 environmental and organizational interests. Those interests have been and will continue to be affected
27

28

3

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

by the actions challenged herein, which have precluded informed public participation and would cause

2 substantial harm to the environment.

3

4 EXHAUSTION AND INADEQUACY OF REMEDIES

5 13. AEWSD timely commented on the IS/MND and the Project. It has performed all
and all administrative remedies to the 6 conditions precedent to filing this action and has exhausted any

7 extent required by law.

8 14. AEWSD has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section 21167.5

9 by sending written notice of intent to commence this action. A copy of the written notice and proof of

10 service is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

11 15. AEWSD has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law unless

KAPLAN KIRSCH & ROCKWELL LLP 12 this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Defendants and Respondents to set aside their
+OI+6 VO 'OOSIONVAI NVS 0167 ALINS 'IAIALS HWOSNVS ENO 13 approval of the Project and the IS/MND.

14
JURISDICTION AND VENUE 15
16. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Article VI, Section 10 of the California 16

17 Constitution; Code of Civil Procedure sections 410.10, 526, 526a, and 1060; and Code of Civil

18 Procedure section 1094.5 and Public Resources Code section 21168 or, in the alternative, Code of Civil

19 Procedure section 1085 and Public Resources Code section 21168.5.

20 17. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 393 because

21 the impacts of the Project will be felt by AEWSD - and this cause arises - within the County of Kern. -

22
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
23
18. The FKC extends from Friant Dam (which impounds Millerton Lake, north of Fresno)
24

25 southward along the eastern edge of the San Joaquin Valley to the Kern River (near Bakersfield) - a

26 distance of more than 150 miles. Maintained and operated by the Friant Water Authority ("FWA"), the

27 canal is designed to convey CVP water using gravity flow.

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

19. AEWSD, like other San Joaquin Valley irrigation districts downstream (south) of the

2 Project, relies on the FKC for delivery of San Joaquin River water from and through Millerton Lake.

3 Indeed, AEWSD's contract for CVP water expressly provides for water "stored in and flowing through

4 Millerton Lake." Millerton water is of exceptionally high quality, which is important because crops

5 grown in AEWSD - including citrus, almond, and vineyards - are particularly sensitive to boron,

6 sodium chloride, bicarbonate, total dissolved solids, pH, and other water quality constituents of concern. l
7 Groundwater in and around PID is of much lower quality, and its introduction into the FKC can directly

8 harm irrigated crops and cause constituents of concern to accumulate in AEWSD's groundwater. In a

9 2012 study, of which PID has been aware at all relevant times, FWA described in detail some of the
10 harms to downstream CVP contractors caused by "recirculated" (i.e., not pure Millerton) water.
11 20. Groundwater extraction near the FKC - even if it does not involve discharge into the
KAPLAN KIRSCH & ROCKWELL LLP 12
POIP6 VO 'OOSIONVAJ NVS 0167 ALINS 'IAIALS HWOSNVS ENO canal - also creates and exacerbates significant subsidence problems. Because of the FKC's gravity-
13 flow design, subsidence impacts the canal's capacity to convey water to downstream users like AEWSD.
14 FWA studies, of which PID has been aware at all relevant times, show that subsidence along the FKC
15 has impacted conveyance capacity by approximately 60%. Indeed, subsidence has prevented delivery of
16 over 300,000 AF and resulted in a projected reduction in long-term deliveries of Class 2 water of nearly
17 100,000 AF per year. AEWSD has already lost access to a significant volume of its surface water
18
supply, which, in turn, risks exacerbating groundwater issues (and Sustainable Groundwater
19
Management Act compliance) in the underlying Kern County Subbasin. Further subsidence will result 20

21 In additional restrictions on water conveyance, worsening these impacts and hindering AEWSD's ability
to receive its contractual allocations of CVP water.
22
21. 23 AEWSD is located at the southern end of the FKC and within a closed basin. a As a result,

24 it will bear the brunt of any FKC capacity or water quality issues resulting from projects near the FKC.

25 22. In December 2021, PID released a Draft IS/MND for the Project. The Draft IS/MND

26 stated that the Project involved three water banking facilities - Jones Corner, Burns, and Los Robles -

27 each of which is located in close proximity to the FKC. The Draft IS/MND admitted the Project sites

28 are "in the vicinity of known subsidence and are located near the FKC, which is critical infrastructure."

5

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

The Draft IS/MND stated the Project will "bank" (i.e., store within groundwater) Millerton water from

2 the FKC at the Project sites for later withdrawal elsewhere. However, the Draft IS/MND also stated the

3 Project may bank other water from other systems. The IS/MND further stated that banking operations

4 will be carried out pursuant to a Banking Agreement between Homer and PID and the Project "will not

5 include recovery wells." The Draft IS/MND did not include a copy of the Banking Agreement, nor did

6 PID otherwise circulate the Banking Agreement for public review and comment.
7 23. The Draft IS/MND's environmental analysis did not identify any specific locations,
8 timing, depth, rate, or flow path for withdrawal of banked water. Nor did it provide it any location-
9 specific evaluation of potential subsidence or water quality impacts. However, in recognition of the
10 Project's potential to cause significant subsidence impacts, the Draft IS/MND included a provision that
11 would have prohibited withdrawal of banked water within one mile of the FKC unless and until
KAPLAN KIRSCH & ROCKWELL LLP 12
POIP6 VO 'OOSIONVAA NVS 0167 ALINS 'IAIALS HWOSNVS ENO authorized by a subsidence plan adopted by the third-party Eastern Tule Groundwater Sustainability
13 Management Agency ("ETGSA"). The Draft IS/MND also purported to impose various monitoring and
14 reporting requirements. But it did not propose to halt groundwater withdrawals in the event of
15 subsidence. Nor did it propose any means of reversing any subsidence that might occur. Indeed,
16 substantial evidence demonstrates that subsidence can rarely be reversed - once detected, it is usually
17
permanent.
18
24. AEWSD timely provided PID with comments on the Draft IS/MND, as well as a flash
19
Among other things, AEWSD's 20 drive containing expert reports and other relevant substantial evidence.

21 comments explained that the Draft IS/MND did not include an accurate and complete description of the

22 Project and failed to address important Project elements; left ambiguity regarding potential water quality

23 impacts on the FKC and downstream water users; failed to provide meaningful information or analysis

24 regarding the Project's subsidence impacts even though substantial evidence demonstrates such impacts

25 would be significant; relied on an incomplete and inadequate subsidence monitoring program even

26 though subsidence is generally irreversible; failed to impose specific, enforceable mitigation measures

27 that would limit environmental impacts to less-than-significant levels; relied on and assumed

28 compliance with various ETGSA plans even though those plans had yet to be finalized or adopted; and

6

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

failed to address the cumulative consequences of the Project together with the dozens of other, similar

2 actions taking place - and planned for - the same geographic area.

3 25. AEWSD was not the only expert agency to express concerns about the Draft IS/MND

4 and the Project. FWA also provided PID with comments and expert analyses explaining, among other

5 things, that the Draft IS/MND did not provide necessary information about the Project; failed to properly

6 evaluate the Project's significant subsidence impacts; and improperly relied on incomplete,

7 unenforceable, and ineffective mitigation measures and conditions. AEWSD's submission incorporated

8 by reference FWA's comments and expert analyses.
9 26. In addition, the California Department of Fish & Wildlife submitted comments
10 identifying errors in the Draft IS/MND's environmental analysis and explaining that the document's
11 proposed mitigation measures were inadequate.
KAPLAN KIRSCH & ROCKWELLLLP 12 27. On January 28, 2022, the California Department of Water Resources issued an POIP6 VO 'OOSIONVMH NVS 0167 ALINS 'IAIALS HWOSNVS ENO 13 "Incomplete Determination of the 2020 Groundwater Sustainability Plans Submitted for the San Joaquin
14 Valley - Tule Subbasin," a copy of which is attached as Exhibit B (the "DWR Determination"). The
15 DWR Determination concluded that ETGSA's proposed Groundwater Sustainability Plan, on which the
16 Draft IS/MND relied, was deficient as a matter of law and could not be approved in its then-current
17 form. More specifically, the DWR Determination faulted the ETGSA's proposed Plan for failing to set
18
specific thresholds and objectives for groundwater levels or land subsidence. The DWR Determination
19 further found that the ETGSA's proposed Plan lacked sufficient information to justify its proposed 20

21 management criteria for degraded water quality. The DWR Determination ordered that the Plan be

22 revised and re-submitted.

28. 23 On February 15, 2022, the Board purported to adopt a Final IS/MND and approve the

24 Project. Although AEWSD had previously lodged a standing request for PID to provide copies of all

25 CEQA and related documents for proposed actions near the FKC, the Final IS/MND for the Project was

26 not included in a "Board Packet" circulated to AEWSD in advance of the Board's February 15 meeting.

27 Nor was the IS/MND otherwise made available to AEWSD (or other interested parties) before the

28 meeting. And while a Board agenda referencing the Project was posted to PID's website, no staff report,

7

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

response to comments, proposed findings, or proposed approval resolution was available for review or

2 comment in advance of the meeting either.

3 29. After the close of business on February 16, 2022, PID's General Manager sent AEWSD

4 an electronic copy of the Final IS/MND purportedly adopted the day before. PID's General Manager
5 also sent AEWSD electronic copies of (a) the NOD, stamped "Feb 16 2022"; (b) a document titled

6 "Response to Public Comments" (hereinafter "Response") and voluminous attachments thereto; and (c)
7 various technical documents and maps.

8 30. The Final IS/MND and the Response substantially revise the Draft IS/MND and the
9 Project itself. Substantial revisions include, without limitation, the following changes:
10 a. The Final IS/MND includes new mitigation measures found nowhere in the Draft
11 IS/MND.

KAPLAN KIRSCH & ROCKWELL LLP 12
+OTP6 VO 'OOSIONVAH NVS 0167 ALINS 'IAIALS HWOSNVS ENO b. The Final IS/MND makes significant changes to mitigation measures presented in the

13 Draft IS/MND. For example, whereas the Draft IS/MND would prohibit withdrawal of

14 groundwater within one mile of the FKC unless and until authorized by an adopted plan

15 of the ETGSA, the Final IS/MND substantially weakened the measure by allowing PID

16 itself to authorize such withdrawals as a "policy" decision.

17 C. Attachments to the Response include a document purporting to be a Banking Agreement

18 between Homer, LLC and PID. The Banking Agreement expressly references the

19 possibility of placing groundwater into the FKC. In addition, page 2-3 of the Final

20 IS/MND contains new language discussing introduction of groundwater into the FKC,

21 including a statement that "[n]ew wells are not part of this Project and now water will be

22 pumped back into the FKC."

23 d. The Final IS/MND contains substantial new information and analysis regarding

24 potentially significant environmental impacts.

25 e. The Final IS/MND revises the description of the Project to disclose that banked water

26 may migrate to areas from which withdrawals would be permitted to occur.

27

28

8

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

31. In other respects, however, the Final IS/MND remained unchanged from the earlier Draft

2 IS/MND. For example (and notwithstanding AEWSD and FWA comments), the Final IS/MND, like the

3 Draft IS/MND before it, fails to address potential water quality impacts that would result from

4 introduction of groundwater into the FKC; does not provide a complete and adequate Project

5 description; lacks information about location, timing, depth, rate, and flow path of proposed

6 groundwater withdrawals, each of which is necessary to determine the Project's impact on groundwater

7 and subsidence; does not evaluate the Project cumulatively with other past, present, and reasonably
8 foreseeable actions affecting FKC water quality, groundwater, and subsidence; improperly relies on
9 and assumes compliance with - ETGSA plans, including some in draft form; declines to prepare a full
10 EIR, despite substantial evidence that the Project may significantly impact the environment; and relies
11 on incomplete and inadequate mitigation and monitoring.
KAPLAN KIRSCH & ROCKWELL LLP 12 32. On March 8, 2022, AEWSD asked PID's General Manager to provide any findings POIP6 VO 'OOSIONVAA NVS 0167 ALINS 'IAIALS HWOSNVS ENO 13 adopted in connect with the Project's approval. In response, PID's General Manager provided an
14 electronic copy of PID resolution number 2022-02-02, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit C.
15

16 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

17 (Violation of CEQA, Pub. Res. Code § 21000, et seq.)

18 33. AEWSD re-alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 32, inclusive, as

19 if fully set forth below.

20 34. The Project is a discretionary action that will cause physical changes in the environment.

21 Therefore, it is a "project" subject to CEQA. (Pub. Res. Code 21065.)

22 35. Defendants and Respondents committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to

23 proceed in a manner required by law by relying on an IS/MND that fails to meet the requirements of
24 CEQA for disclosure, analysis, and mitigation of significant impacts; by failing to recirculate their
25 analyses after making substantial revisions; and by failing to prepare a full EIR prior to approving the
26 Project.
27

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

36. CEQA requires public agencies to identify, evaluate, and disclose to interested parties

2 and the public the reasonably foreseeable environmental consequences of proposed projects. CEQA's

3 mandate for detailed environmental review ensures, among other things, that public agencies "will fully

4 consider the information necessary to render decisions that intelligently take into account the

5 environmental consequences." (Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish & Game Commission (1997) 16

6 Cal.4th 105, 133.) Thus, the CEQA process "protects not only the environment but also informed self-
7 government." (Citizens of Goleta Valley Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564.)

8 37. Under CEQA, an EIR must be prepared prior to project approval whenever there is
9 substantial evidence to support a fair argument that the consequences of the project may be significant.
10 (Pub. Res. Code § 21100; CEQA Guidelines §§ 15064, 15382, 15384.) A project may only be approved
11 on the basis of a mitigated negative declaration if potentially significant impacts can be reduced to less
KAPLAN KIRSCH & ROCKWELLLLP 12
+OTP6 VO 'OOSIONVAH NVS 0167 ALINS 'IAIALS HWOSNVS ENO than significant levels through specific and enforceable mitigation measures or conditions. (Pub. Res.
13 Code §§ 21064.5, 21081.6(b); CEQA Guidelines §§ 15070-15075.)
14 38. As part of the environmental review process, CEQA requires that public agencies
15 thoroughly analyze and disclose direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts. (CEQA Guidelines § 15064.)
16 "An EIR must be prepared if the cumulative impact may be significant and the project's incremental
17 effect, though individually limited, is cumulatively considerable."(CEQA Guidelines § 15064(h).)
18 Analysis of cumulative impacts requires consideration of other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable
19
probable future projects because cumulative consequences can result from individually minor but 20

21 collectively significant projects. (CEQA Guidelines § 15355.)

39. 22 If an IS/MND is "substantially revised" after its initial review and comment period, the

23 document must be recirculated prior to adoption and project approval. (CEQA Guidelines 15073.5.)

24 Substantial revisions include, without limitation, addition of new mitigation measures or conditions

25 addressing a potentially significant environmental impact and changes to mitigation measure made

26 without proper findings. (CEQA Guidelines § 15073.5(b).)

27

28

10

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

40. PID's CEQA review for the Project, including the IS/MND, was woefully inadequate and

2 did not even approach compliance with the basic, well-established requirements described above. As a

3 result, PID's approval of the Project violates CEQA in numerous respects, including the following:

4 a. The IS/MND fails to provide a complete, accurate, and stable Project description. It sends

5 unclear and conflicting signals to decision-makers and the public and does not clearly

6 articulate a specific course of action. As a result, interested parties - including AEWSD -
7 and decision-makers were left without timely access to important information about the

8 proposal and its impacts.
9 b. The Final IS/MND and attachments to the Response suggest introduction of groundwater into
10 the FKC may be contemplated and foreseeable, but the IS/MND fails to address water quality
11 impacts that would result.
KAPLAN KIRSCH & ROCKWELLLLP 12 C. The IS/MND lacks specific information about anticipated location, timing, depth, rate, and +O1P6 VO 'OOSIONVA  NVS 0167 ALINS 'IAIALS HINOSNVS ENO 13 flow paths for recovery of banked water, each of which is necessary to evaluate potential
14 groundwater and subsidence impacts.
15 d. In its evaluation of environmental impacts, the IS/MND improperly relies on - and assumes
16 compliance with - ETGSA plans the terms and applicability of which have yet to be
17 finalized.
18
c. PID relies on inadequate and incomplete mitigation and monitoring. The measures set forth
19 in the IS/MND are not specific, enforceable, or effective, as CEQA requires. Moreover, 20
AEWSD is informed and believes that PID failed to exercise independent judgment or make 21

22 required findings, supported by substantial evidence, with respect to mitigation measures,

23 monitoring, and Project conditions.

24 f. The IS/MND fails to address the Project's cumulative impacts as required by Public

25 Resources Code, section 21083(b) and CEQA Guidelines, section 15064(i). PID did not

26 consider the Project cumulatively with other current and probable future projects that have

27 the potential to impact FKC water quality, groundwater, and subsidence.

28

11

Re: Notice of Initiation of California Environmental Quality Act Action
Dear Jody:
Please take notice, pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 21167.5, that Arvin-Edison Water
Storage District ("AEWSD") intends to commence an action against the Porterville Irrigation District and the Porterville Irrigation District Board of Directors (together, "PID"), for writ of mandate to set aside the decisions to approve the Jones Corner/Burns/Los Robles Water Banks Project (the "Project"), adopt an Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration ("IS/MND") for the Project, and take related actions.
The action is based on the failure of PID and the Board to comply with California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). It will allege that PID failed to follow the required procedures and requirements, including by preparing a legally deficient IS/MND, failing to recirculate the
IS/MND after making substantial changes, and failing to prepare an Environmental Impact Report.
Among other things, the action will seek to invalidate and set aside the Project and the IS/MND; to stay and enjoin any action to further implementation of the Project; to secure a declaration that the Project and its approvals are of no force or effect; and to recover costs and fees.
If you need more information or have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
Sincerely,

RE: Incomplete Determination of the 2020 Groundwater Sustainability Plans Submitted for the San Joaquin Valley - Tule Subbasin

Dear David De Groot,

The Department of Water Resources (Department) has evaluated the six groundwater sustainability plans (GSPs) submitted for the San Joaquin Valley - Tule Subbasin (Subbasin), as well as the materials considered to be part of the required coordination agreement. Collectively, the six GSPs and the coordination agreement are referred to as the Plan for the Subbasin. The Department has determined that the Plan is
incomplete pursuant to Section 355.2(e)(2) of the GSP Regulations.

The Department based its incomplete determination on recommendations from the Staff Report, included as an enclosure to the attached Statement of Findings, which describes that the Subbasin's Plan does not satisfy the objectives of the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) nor substantially comply with the GSP Regulations. The Staff Report also provides corrective actions which the Department recommends the
Subbasin's 7 groundwater sustainability agencies (GSAs) review while determining how and whether to address the deficiencies in a coordinated manner.

The Subbasin's GSAs have 180 days, the maximum allowed by the GSP Regulations, to address the identified deficiencies. Where addressing the deficiencies requires
modification of the Plan, the GSAs must adopt those modifications into their respective GSPs and all applicable coordination agreement materials, or otherwise demonstrate
that those modifications are part of the Plan before resubmitting it to the Department for
evaluation no later than July 27, 2022. The Department understands that much work
has occurred to advance sustainable groundwater management since the GSAs submitted their GSPs in January 2020. To the extent to which those efforts are related or responsive to the Department's identified deficiencies, we encourage you to document that as part of your Plan resubmittal. The Department prepared a Frequently Asked Questions document to provide general information and guidance on the of addressing deficiencies in an incomplete determination. process

Department staff will work expeditiously to review the revised components of your Plan
resubmittal. If the revisions sufficiently address the identified deficiencies, the
Department will determine that the Plan is approved. In that scenario, Department staff

Page 2 of 2
will identify additional recommended corrective actions that the GSAs should address
early in implementing their GSPs (i.e., no later than the first required periodic
evaluation). Among other items, those corrective actions will recommend the GSAs
provide more detail on their plans and schedules to address data gaps. Those
recommendations will call for significantly expanded documentation of the plans and
schedules to implement specific projects and management actions. Regardless of those
recommended corrective actions, the Department expects the first periodic evaluations, required no later than January 2025 one-quarter of the way through the 20-year
implementation period - to document significant progress toward achieving sustainable
groundwater management.
If the Subbasin's GSAs cannot address the deficiencies identified in this letter by July
27, 2022, then the Department, after consultation with the State Water Resources
Control Board, will determine the GSP to be inadequate. In that scenario, the State Water Resources Control Board may identify additional deficiencies that the GSAs would need to address in the state intervention processes outlined in SGMA.

Please contact Sustainable Groundwater Management Office staff by emailing
sgmps@water.ca.gov if you have any questions about the Department's assessment,
implementation of your Plan, or to arrange a meeting with the Department.

Thank you,

STATE OF CALIFORNIA
DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES

STATEMENT OF FINDINGS REGARDING THE
DETERMINATION OF INCOMPLETE STATUS OF THE
SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY - TULE SUBBASIN
GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY PLANS

The Department of Water Resources (Department) is required to evaluate whether a
submitted groundwater sustainability plan (GSP) conforms to specific requirements of the
Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA), is likely to achieve the sustainability
goal for the basin covered by the GSP, and whether the GSP adversely affects the ability
of an adjacent basin to implement its GSP or impedes achievement of sustainability goals
in an adjacent basin. (Water Code § 10733.) The Department is directed to issue an
assessment of the GSP within two years of its submission. (Water Code § 10733.4.)
SGMA allows for multiple GSPs implemented by multiple groundwater sustainability
agencies (GSAs) and coordinated pursuant to a single coordination agreement that
covers the entire basin to be an acceptable planning scenario. (Water Code § 10727.) In
the San Joaquin Valley - Tule Subbasin (Subbasin), six separate GSPs were prepared
by 7 GSAs pursuant to the required coordination agreement. This Statement of Findings
explains the Department's decision regarding the multiple GSPs covering the Subbasin
submitted jointly by the multiple GSAs. Collectively, the six GSPs and the coordination
agreement are referred to as the Plan for the Subbasin. Individually, the GSPs include
the following:
Groundwater Sustainability Plan, Alpaugh Groundwater Sustainability Agency
(Alpaugh GSP) - The Alpaugh GSP is managed by a single GSA, the Alpaugh
GSA.

Tri-County Water Authority, Groundwater Sustainability Plan (Tri-County GSP) -
The Tri-County GSP is managed by a single GSA, Tri-County Water Authority, and

Department management has reviewed the enclosed Staff Report, which recommends
that the deficiencies identified should preclude approval of the Plan. Based on its review
of the Staff Report, Department management is satisfied that staff have conducted a
thorough evaluation and assessment of the Plan and concurs with, and hereby adopts,
staff's recommendation and all the corrective actions provided. The Department thus
deems the Plan incomplete based on the Staff Report and the findings contained herein.
A. The GSPs do not define undesirable results or set minimum thresholds and
measurable objectives for groundwater levels in a manner consistent with the
GSP Regulations.
1 . The GSPs do not describe, with information specific to the Subbasin, the
groundwater level conditions that are considered significant and
unreasonable and would result in undesirable results. The GSPs do not
explain or justify how the quantitative definition of undesirable results is
consistent with avoiding effects the GSAs have identified as undesirable
results.

2. The GSPs do not explain how minimum thresholds at the representative
monitoring sites are consistent with the requirement to be based on a
groundwater elevation indicating a depletion of supply at a given location.
The GSPs do not demonstrate that the established sustainable
management criteria are based on a commensurate level of
understanding of the basin setting or whether the interests of beneficial
uses and users have been considered.

Statement of Findings
San Joaquin Valley - Tule Subbasin (Basin No. 5-022.13)

B. The GSPs do not define undesirable results or set minimum thresholds and
measurable objectives for land subsidence in a manner consistent with the GSP
Regulations.

1 . In areas adjacent to the Friant-Kern Canal, the GSPs do not identify,
through analysis, the total amount of subsidence that can be tolerated by
the Friant-Kern Canal during implementation of the GSPs in order to
maintain the ability to reasonably operate to meet contracted for water
supply deliveries. The GSPs do not explain how implementation of
projects and management actions is consistent both with achieving the long-term avoidance or minimization of subsidence and with not
exceeding the tolerable amount of cumulative subsidence adjacent to the
Canal.

2. The GSPs do not explain how the criteria defining when undesirable
results occur in the Subbasin was established, the rationale behind the
approach, and why it is consistent with avoiding the significant and
unreasonable effects identified by the GSAs.
3. The GSPs do not identify land uses and property interests, apart from the
Friant-Kern Canal, susceptible to impacts from land subsidence, explain
how they were considered, and describe the rationale for establishing
minimum thresholds for land subsidence in consideration of uses and
interests, or provide reasonable and convincing evidence that the other
areas of the basin are not susceptible to impacts from land subsidence.
4. The GSPs' current minimum thresholds and measurable objectives for
land subsidence are not consistent with the intent of SGMA that
subsidence be avoided or minimized once sustainability is achieved in the
Subbasin.

C. The GSPs do not provide sufficient information to justify the proposed sustainable
management criteria for degraded water quality.
1 . The GSPs do not pecify what groundwater conditions are considered
suitable for agricultural irrigation and domestic use. The GSPs do not
explain the choice of constituents (pH, conductivity, and nitrate) as a
means of evaluating impacts to beneficial uses and users, especially
agricultural irrigation.
2. The GSPs do not explain how the use of a 10-year running average to
establish the sustainable management criteria will avoid undesirable

results due to degraded groundwater quality and related potential effects
of the undesirable results to existing regulatory standards. The GSPs do
not explain how the criteria defining when undesirable results occur in the
Subbasin was established, the rationale behind the approach, and why it
is consistent with avoiding significant and unreasonable effects associated
with groundwater pumping and other aspects of the GSAs' implementation
of their GSPs.

3. The GSPs do not explain how the sustainable management criteria for
degraded water quality relate to existing groundwater regulatory requirements in the Subbasin and how the GSAs will coordinate with
existing agencies and programs to assess whether or not implementation
of the GSPs is contributing to the degradation of water quality throughout
the Subbasin.

Based on the above, the Plan submitted by the GSAs in the San Joaquin Valley - Tule
Subbasin is determined to be incomplete because the Plan does not satisfy the
requirements of SGMA, nor does it substantially comply with the GSP Regulations. The
corrective actions provided in the enclosed Staff Report are intended to address the
deficiencies that, at this time, preclude the Plan's approval. The GSAs have up to 180
days to address the deficiencies outlined above and detailed in the Staff Report. Once the GSAs resubmit their respective GSPs and the required coordination agreement, the
Department will review the revised Plan to evaluate whether the deficiencies were sufficiently addressed. Should the GSAs fail to take sufficient actions to correct the
deficiencies identified by the Department, the Department shall disapprove the Plan if,
after consultation with the State Water Resources Control Board, the Department
determines the Plan to be inadequate pursuant to 23 CCR § 355.2(e)(3)(C).

The Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA)1 allows for any of the three
following planning scenarios: a single groundwater sustainability plan (GSP) developed
and implemented by a single groundwater sustainability agency (GSA); a single GSP developed and implemented by multiple GSAs; and multiple GSPs implemented by
multiple GSAs and coordinated pursuant to a single coordination agreement.2 GSAs
developing GSPs are expected to comply with SGMA and substantially comply with the
Department of Water Resources' (Department) GSP Regulations.3 The Department is
required to evaluate an adopted GSP within two years of its submittal date and issue a
written assessment.4

In the Tule Subbasin (Subbasin), six separate GSPs were prepared by seven GSAs
pursuant to a required coordination agreement. 5 The Tule Subbasin Coordination
Agreement (Coordination Agreement) includes a legal agreement signed by all GSAs in
the Subbasin, as well as two key technical documents that are applicable to each of the
GSPs - the Tule Subbasin Monitoring Plan and the Tule Subbasin Setting. Collectively,
the six GSPs and the coordination agreement will, for evaluation and assessment purposes, be treated and referred to as the Plan for the Subbasin. Individually, the GSPs
include the following:

T EVALUATION CRITERIA

The Department evaluates whether a Plan conforms to the statutory requirements of SGMA 17 and is likely to achieve the basin's sustainability goal. 18 To achieve the sustainability goal, the Plan must demonstrate that implementation will lead to sustainable
groundwater management, which means the management and use of groundwater in a
manner that can be maintained during the planning and implementation horizon without
causing undesirable results. 19 Undesirable results are required to be defined
quantitatively by the GSAs overlying a basin and occur when significant and
unreasonable effects for any of the applicable sustainability indicators are caused by
groundwater conditions occurring throughout the basin. 20 The Department is also required to evaluate whether the Plan will adversely affect the ability of an adjacent basin
to implement its groundwater sustainability program or achieve its sustainability goal.21
For a Plan to be evaluated by the Department, it must first be determined that it was
submitted by the statutory deadline22 and that it is complete and covers the entire basin. 23
Additionally, for those GSAs choosing to develop multiple GSPs, the Plan submission must include a coordination agreement.24 The coordination agreement must explain how
the multiple GSPs in the basin have been developed and implemented utilizing the same
data and methodologies and that the elements of the multiple GSPs are based upon
consistent interpretations of the basin's setting. If these required conditions are satisfied,
the Department evaluates the Plan to determine whether it complies with SGMA and
substantially complies with the GSP Regulations.25 As stated in the GSP Regulations,
"[s]ubstantial compliance means that the supporting information is sufficiently detailed
and the analyses sufficiently thorough and reasonable, in the judgment of the
Department, to evaluate the Plan, and the Department determines that any discrepancy
would not materially affect the ability of the Agency to achieve the sustainability goal for the basin, or the ability of the Department to evaluate the likelihood of the Plan to attain that goal."26
When evaluating whether the Plan is likely to achieve the sustainability goal for the basin,
Department staff review the information provided for sufficiency, credibility, and consistency with scientific and engineering professional standards of practice. 27 The
Department's review considers whether there is a reasonable relationship between the

17 Water Code §§ 10727.2, 10727.4, 10727.6.
18 Water Code § 10733(a).

information provided by the GSAs and the assumptions and conclusions presented in the
Plan, including whether the interests of the beneficial uses and users of groundwater in
the basin have been considered; whether sustainable management criteria and projects and management actions described in the Plan are commensurate with the level of
understanding of the basin setting; and whether those projects and management actions
are feasible and likely to prevent undesirable results.28 The Department also considers
whether the GSAs have the legal authority and financial resources necessary to
implement the Plan.29
To the extent overdraft is present in a basin, the Department evaluates whether the Plan provides a reasonable assessment of the overdraft and includes reasonable means to
mitigate it. 30 When applicable, the Department will assess whether coordination
agreements have been adopted by all relevant parties and satisfy the requirements of SGMA and the GSP Regulations.31 The Department also considers whether the Plan provides reasonable measures and schedules to eliminate identified data gaps. 32 Lastly,
the Department's review considers the comments submitted on the Plan and evaluates
whether the GSAs have adequately responded to the comments that raise credible
technical or policy issues with the Plan. 33
The Department is required to evaluate the Plan within two years of its submittal date and
issue a written assessment. 34 The assessment is required to include a determination of
the Plan's status. 35 The GSP Regulations provide three options for determining the status
of a Plan: approved,36 incomplete, 37 or inadequate.38
After review of the Plan, Department staff may conclude that the information provided is
not sufficiently detailed, or the analyses not sufficiently thorough and reasonable, to
evaluate whether it is likely to achieve the sustainability goal for the basin. If the
Department determines the deficiencies precluding approval may be capable of being corrected by the GSAs in a timely manner,39 the Department will determine the status of the Plan to be incomplete. A formerly deemed incomplete Plan may be resubmitted to the Department for reevaluation after all deficiencies have been addressed and incorporated
into the Plan within 180 days after the Department makes its incomplete determination.
The Department will review the revised Plan to evaluate whether the identified
deficiencies were sufficiently addressed. Depending on the outcome of that evaluation,

the Department may determine the resubmitted Plan is approved. Alternatively, the
Department may conclude a formerly deemed incomplete GSP is inadequate if, after
consultation with the State Water Resources Control Board, it determines that the GSAs
have not taken sufficient actions to correct any identified deficiencies.40
The staff assessment of the Plan involves the review of information presented by the
GSAs, including models and assumptions, and an evaluation of that information based
on scientific reasonableness. In conducting its assessment, the Department does not
recalculate or reevaluate technical information provided in the Plan or perform its own geologic or engineering analysis of that information. The recommendation to approve a Plan does not signify that Department staff, were they to exercise the professional
judgment required to develop a Plan for the basin, would make the same assumptions
and interpretations as those contained in the Plan, but simply that Department staff have determined that the assumptions and interpretations relied upon by the submitting GSAs
are supported by adequate, credible evidence, and are scientifically reasonable.
Lastly, the Department's review and assessment of an approved Plan is a continual
process. Both SGMA and the GSP Regulations provide the Department with the ongoing
authority and duty to review the implementation of the Plan.41 Also, GSAs have an
ongoing duty to reassess their GSPs, provide annual reports to the Department, and,
when necessary, update or amend their GSPs.42 The passage of time or new information may make what is reasonable and feasible at the time of this review to not be so in the
future. The emphasis of the Department's periodic reviews will be to assess the GSA's
progress toward achieving the basin's sustainability goal and whether implementation of the Plan adversely affects the ability of GSAs in adjacent basins to achieve their
sustainability goals.

2 REQUIRED CONDITIONS
A GSP, to be evaluated by the Department, must be submitted within the applicable statutory deadline.43 The GSP must also be complete and must, either on its own or in coordination with other GSPs, cover the entire basin.44 Additionally, when multiple GSPs are developed in a basin, the submission of all GSPs must include a coordination agreement.45 The coordination agreement must explain how the multiple GSPs in the
basin have been developed and implemented utilizing the same data and methodologies
and that the elements of the multiple GSPs are based upon consistent interpretations of
the basin's setting. If a Plan is determined to be incomplete, Department staff may require
corrective actions that address minor or potentially significant deficiencies identified in the

40 23 CCR § 355.2(e)(3)(C). 41 Water Code § 10733.8; 23 CCR § 355.6 et seq. 42 Water Code §§ 10728 et seq., 10728.2. 43 Water Code § 10720.7.

Plan. The GSAs in a basin, whether developing a single GSP covering the basin or
multiple GSPs, must sufficiently address those required corrective actions within the time provided, not to exceed 180 days, for the Plan to be reevaluated by the Department and
potentially approved.

2.1 SUBMISSION DEADLINE
SGMA required basins categorized as high- or medium-priority as of January 1, 2017 and
that were subject to critical conditions of overdraft to submit a GSP no later than January 31, 2020.46
The Point of Contact representing seven GSAs submitted the Subbasin's Plan on January
30, 2020, in compliance with the statutory deadline. The Plan consists of six GSPs and
the required coordination agreement.

2.2 COMPLETENESS
GSP Regulations specify that the Department shall evaluate a Plan if that Plan is complete and includes the information required by SGMA and the GSP Regulations.47
For those basins choosing to submit multiple GSPs, a coordination agreement is required.
The seven GSAs submitted six separate adopted GSPs that together cover the Subbasin.
Department staff found the GSPs, and the collective Plan, to be complete and include the
required information, sufficient to warrant an evaluation by the Department. The
Department posted the Subbasin's six GSPs and coordination agreement to its website
on February 19, 2020.

2.3 BASIN COVERAGE
A GSP, either on its own or in coordination with other GSPs, must cover the entire basin. 48
A Plan that intends to cover the entire basin may be presumed to do so if the basin is fully
contained within the jurisdictional boundaries of the submitting GSA(s).
The Plan intends to manage the entire Tule Subbasin and collectively the jurisdictional
boundaries of the submitting GSAs cover the entire Subbasin.

3 PLAN EVALUATION

As stated in Section 355.4 of the GSP Regulations, a basin "shall be sustainably managed
within 20 years of the applicable statutory deadline consistent with the objectives of the
Act." The Department's assessment is based on a number of related factors49 including
whether the elements of a GSP were developed in the manner required by the GSP Regulations, 50 whether the GSP was developed using appropriate data and methodologies and whether its conclusions are scientifically reasonable, 51 and whether the GSP, through the implementation of clearly defined and technically feasible projects
and management actions, is likely to achieve a tenable sustainability goal for the basin. 52
Department staff have identified deficiencies in the GSPs, the most significant of which
preclude staff from recommending approval of the Plan at this time. Department staff believe the GSAs may be able to correct the identified deficiencies within 180 days.
Consistent with the GSP Regulations, Department staff are providing corrective actions
related to the deficiencies, detailed below, including the general regulatory background,
the specific deficiency identified in the Plan, and the specific actions to address the
deficiency.

GENERAL BACKGROUND
SGMA allows for multiple GSPs to be implemented by multiple GSAs and coordinated
pursuant to a single coordination agreement that covers an entire basin.53 The GSP
Regulations and SGMA detail the requirements for a coordination agreement and the
elements of the GSPs necessary to be coordinated to achieve the basin's sustainability goal. 54 The coordination agreement must provide both administrative and technical
coordination and consistency between all the GSPs. The collective submittals for the basin are to be based upon consistent interpretations of the basin setting and utilize the same data and methodologies. 55 In the context of utilizing the same data and
methodologies, the coordination agreement must provide the following: 56
a coordinated water budget for the basin, including groundwater extraction data,
surface water supply, total water use, and change in groundwater in storage;
a sustainable yield for the basin, supported by a description of the undesirable
results for the basin, and an explanation of how the minimum thresholds and

measurable objectives defined by each GSP relate to those undesirable results, based on information described in the basin setting; and
an explanation of how the GSPs implemented together satisfy the requirements of
SGMA and are in substantial compliance with the GSP Regulations.
The Department is tasked with evaluating whether the GSPs, in coordination with one
another, conform with the required regulatory contents and are likely to achieve the sustainability goal for the basin. 57

3.1 DEFICIENCY 1. THE GSPS DO NOT DEFINE UNDESIRABLE RESULTS OR SET
MINIMUM THRESHOLDS AND MEASURABLE OBJECTIVES FOR GROUNDWATER
LEVELS IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE GSP REGULATIONS

3.1.1 Background
GSAs must develop minimum thresholds for chronic lowering of groundwater levels that
are based on a groundwater elevation indicating a depletion of supply at a given location
that may lead to undesirable results. The description of minimum thresholds must include
the following, among other items:
A discussion of the potential effects on the beneficial uses and users of
groundwater, on land uses and property interests, and other potential effects that may occur or are occurring in the Subbasin.58
The information and criteria relied upon to establish minimum thresholds for chronic lowering of groundwater levels, supported by information from the basin setting, and other data or models as appropriate.59
Additionally, the Department must consider "whether the assumptions, criteria, findings,
and objectives, including the sustainability goal, undesirable results, minimum thresholds,
measurable objectives, and interim milestones are reasonable and supported by the best
available information and best available science."60

3.1.2 Deficiency Details
Based on review of the Coordination Agreement and the six GSPs in the Tule Subbasin,
Department staff conclude that sustainable management criteria for chronic lowering of
groundwater levels were not defined in a manner required by SGMA and the GSP
Regulations.
Undesirable Results. The Coordination Agreement identifies the potential effects
associated with chronic lowering of groundwater levels as causing well failures, additional
operational costs for groundwater extraction from deeper pumping levels, and additional
57 Water Code § 10733(b); 23 CCR § 355.4(b). 58 23 CCR § 354.26(b)(3); 23 CCR 354.28(b)(4). 59 23 CCR § 354.28(b)(1). 60 23 CCR § 355.4(b)(1).

California Department of Water Resources
Sustainable Groundwater Management Program Page 9 of 22

GSP Assessment Staff Report San Joaquin Valley - Tule Subbasin (No. 5-022.13) January 28, 2022
costs to lower pumps, deepen wells, or drill new wells. The undesirable result for chronic lowering of groundwater levels is defined as a "basin-wide loss of well pumping capacity, which cannot be remedied."61 Neither the Coordination Agreement nor the GSPs describe
the groundwater conditions that would lead to impacts to well pumping capacities or under
what conditions the ability to pump groundwater could no longer be remedied. The
Coordination Agreement further states that localized lowering of groundwater levels that
produce undesirable results may affect Subbasin-wide groundwater conditions resulting
in minimum threshold exceedances or limiting the Subbasin from achieving the
measurable objectives. 62 Although the Coordination Agreement generally states the
possible effects caused by localized groundwater level declines, neither the Coordination Agreement nor the GSPs disclose the impacts to beneficial uses and users that would
occur throughout a the Subbasin as a result of the localized groundwater level declines.
From the descriptions provided, Department staff are unable to assess how localized
groundwater level decline would affect the possible "basin-wide loss of well pumping
capacity" or which beneficial users (i.e., agricultural well pumping capacity, drinking water
well pumping capacity, etc.) would be impacted and to what degree because none of this
information is quantified in the GSPs.
The GSPs define undesirable results for chronic lowering of groundwater levels in the
Subbasin as the unreasonable lowering of the groundwater elevation below the minimum
threshold for two consecutive years at greater than 50 percent of GSA Management Area
representative monitoring sites, which results in significant impacts to groundwater supply.63 The GSPs do not explain how the 50 percent criterion was selected or describe
how it relates to specific effects (e.g., resulting in a basin-wide loss of well capacity) that
the GSAs identified as undesirable results. Consequently, Department staff believe the
GSPs do not adequately justify or describe how groundwater level declines below the
minimum thresholds, which are predominately set below historic lows, for 50 percent of
the GSA Management Area representative monitoring sites for two consecutive years
does not result in a significant loss of groundwater supply. (see Corrective Action 1)
Minimum Thresholds. The Subbasin's GSAs define minimum thresholds for chronic
lowering of groundwater levels using a groundwater flow model projection of groundwater
level conditions assuming successful implementation of all projects and management actions. Five of the GSPs64 describe that the minimum threshold for groundwater levels
for each representative monitoring site was determined utilizing the following stepwise
process:

61 Tule Subbasin Coordination Agreement p. 48. 62 Tule Subbasin Coordination Agreement p. 49. 63 Tule Subbasin Coordination Agreement p. 49; Tri-County GSP, page 238; Eastern Tule GSP, p. 212; Lower Tule River Irrigation District GSP, p. 187-188; Delano-Earlimart Irrigation District GSP, p. 154; Alpaugh GSP, p. 42-43; Pixley Irrigation District GSP, p. 147-148. 64 The five GSPs include the Alpaugh GSP, Delano-Earlimart Irrigation District GSP, Eastern Tule GSP, Lower Tule River Irrigation District GSP, and Pixley Irrigation District GSP.

Create a hydrograph of historical and future projected groundwater levels from the
groundwater flow model.
Establish interim milestones based on the projected water level conditions with the lowest interim milestone during the first 10-years of implementation generally
corresponding to the projected value in 2030.
Evaluate the change in groundwater levels experienced during the "recent drought"
from 2007-2016 and subtract that value from the lowest interim milestone during
the initial 10-years of implementation to establish the minimum threshold.
Four of the GSPs 65 state that the GSAs would adjust the projected groundwater
elevations at representative monitoring sites from the groundwater flow model based on
field measurements collected in the future (i.e., a date following adoption of the GSPs in
February 2020) to establish a baseline condition. Similarly, the Alpaugh GSP states adjustments would be made to groundwater elevations at representative monitoring sites based on field measurements but uses measurements collected in 2019. The interim
milestones and the measurable objective for the period between 2020 and 2040 would
then be updated to reflect the adjusted groundwater elevations at the respective
representative monitoring sites.
While Department staff expects GSAs to update models and other technical information
based on experience and the acquisition of new or improved information, the GSAs must
establish what groundwater level conditions occurring throughout the Subbasin would be
considered significant and unreasonable that the GSAs intend to avoid and are based on
their commensurate understanding of the basin setting. 66 Further, the minimum
thresholds should be informed by that understanding and defined based on what
conditions would lead to or are causing undesirable results in a basin. a 67 Department staff
do not read the GSPs to have established minimum thresholds on the basis of
groundwater conditions that would cause undesirable results based on significant and
unreasonable conditions, but that they are, instead, based on future projected groundwater elevations and that the GSPs do not establish a nexus between conditions at those predicted elevations and undesirable results the GSAs seek to avoid.
GSPs in the Subbasin state that the minimum thresholds were developed to minimize
loss of existing wells via well failures, minimize increased pumping costs, and minimize
additional capital cost to infrastructure, without defining the groundwater conditions under
which those conditions would be experienced.
The Tri-County GSP indicates that the "TCWA Groundwater Model" - a groundwater flow
model developed specifically for the Tri-County Water Authority GSA - was used to

65 The four GSPs include the Delano-Earlimart Irrigation District GSP, Eastern Tule GSP, Lower Tule River Irrigation District GSP, and Pixley Irrigation District GSP. 66 23 CCR § 354.26(b)(1). 67 Water Code 10721(x); 23 CCR § 354.28(a).

develop sustainable management criteria for groundwater elevations by projecting groundwater elevations into the future based on observed historic trends. Tri-County GSP
does not explain how its model was developed, and although the Tri-County GSP also
refers to the Subbasin-wide groundwater flow model (i.e., the Tule Groundwater Flow
Model), the Plan does not describe how the data and information from the Subbasin-wide
groundwater flow model was considered with respect to establishing sustainable management criteria in the Tri-County GSP. 68 Regardless of how the models were
developed or utilized, although the Tri-County GSA presents minimum thresholds for
chronic lowering of groundwater levels, the Tri-County GSP does not explain how the values were established to avoid identified significant and unreasonable conditions.69
In all cases the GSPs failed to explain how minimum thresholds at the representative
monitoring sites were developed in a manner consistent with the requirement that
thresholds be based on a groundwater elevation indicating a depletion of supply at a given
location that may lead to undesirable results. 70 Because minimum thresholds were
defined with reference to targeted groundwater withdrawals and not as a means to avoid
significant and unreasonable effects on the beneficial uses and users of groundwater, the
Plans lack evidence demonstrating the GSAs considered the interests of beneficial users
and uses of groundwater in defining undesirable results or establishing minimum
thresholds. Among potential concerns that will have been overlooked as a result are
effects on drinking water users including domestic wells, a concern raised by several public comments. Because the GSPs did not define undesirable results or establish
minimum thresholds in a manner consistent with the requirements of the GSP
Regulations, Department staff are not able to assess whether the GSAs have established
sustainable management criteria based on a commensurate level of understanding of the
basin setting or whether the interests of beneficial uses and users have been
considered.71 (see Corrective Action 2.)

3.1.3 Corrective Actions
1. The GSAs should revise the GSP to describe, with information specific to the
Subbasin, the groundwater level conditions that are considered significant and
unreasonable and would result in undesirable results as these are described in the
GSP Regulations and as discussed above. The GSAs should define the
conditions, including specific water level depth and well construction information,
anticipated to cause well failures, result in additional operational costs for
groundwater extraction from deeper pumping levels, and result in additional costs
to lower pumps, deepen wells, or drill new wells. The GSAs should then explain or
justify how the quantitative definition of undesirable results (i.e., 50 percent minimum threshold exceedances for two consecutive years), which allows for

68 Tri-County GSP, p. 239. 69 Tri-County GSP, p. 240-251. 70 23 CCR § 354.28(c)(1). 71 23 CCR § 355.4(b)(3-4)

Sustainable Groundwater Management Program Page 12 of 22

GSP Assessment Staff Report San Joaquin Valley - Tule Subbasin (No. 5-022.13) January 28, 2022

potential continued groundwater decline at up to half of the monitoring sites, is
consistent with avoiding the effects the GSAs have determined are undesirable
results.

2. The GSAs must revise their GSPs to explain how minimum thresholds at the
representative monitoring sites are consistent with the requirement to be based on
a groundwater elevation indicating a depletion of supply at a given location. If the
GSAs did not set minimum thresholds consistent with levels indicating a depletion
of supply, they should revise the minimum thresholds accordingly. Groundwater
sustainability agencies in other subbasins have used domestic wells as the
shallowest beneficial user to constrain their groundwater thresholds. The Tule
GSAs may consider incorporating an evaluation of domestic well impacts into the
development of minimum thresholds for the chronic lowering of groundwater to
ensure all beneficial uses and users of groundwater in the Subbasin are
represented. The Tule Subbasin GSAs may need to look to other users, such as
municipal or agricultural groundwater users, as applicable for each monitoring site,
to determine the levels indicating supply depletion when setting minimum
thresholds.

3.2 DEFICIENCY 2. THE GSPS DO NOT DEFINE UNDESIRABLE RESULTS OR SET
MINIMUM THRESHOLDS AND MEASURABLE OBJECTIVES FOR LAND SUBSIDENCE
IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE GSP REGULATIONS

3.2.1 Background
The GSP Regulations state that minimum thresholds for land subsidence should identify
the rate and extent of subsidence that substantially interferes with surface land uses and
may lead to undesirable results. These quantitative values should be supported by:
The identification of land uses or property interests potentially affected by land
subsidence;

An explanation of how impacts to those land uses or property interests were
considered when establishing minimum thresholds; and
Maps or graphs showing the rates and extents of land subsidence defined by the
minimum thresholds.72

3.2.2 Deficiency Details
The Coordination Agreement and six GSPs in the Tule Subbasin do not define
sustainable management criteria for land subsidence in a manner required by SGMA and
the GSP Regulations or provide sufficient explanations of how the undesirable results
and minimum thresholds were selected.

72 23 CCR § 354.28(c)(5).
California Department of Water Resources
Sustainable Groundwater Management Program Page 13 of 22

GSP Assessment Staff Report San Joaquin Valley Tule Subbasin (No. 5-022.13) January 28, 2022

Undesirable Results. The Coordination Agreement defines undesirable results for land
subsidence in the Subbasin as "a loss of functionality of a structure or a facility to the
point that, due to subsidence, the structure or facility, such as the Friant-Kern Canal
(Canal), cannot reasonably operate to meet contracted for [sic] water supply deliveries
without either significant repair or replacement."73 Neither the Coordination Agreement
nor the individual GSPs support this general statement with a quantitative description of
the groundwater conditions that would lead to functional impacts to structures and
facilities, when and where the effects of land subsidence would cause undesirable results
to the Canal, or what loss of functionality to structures or facilities other than the Canal
would have that effect.74 (see Corrective Actions 1 and 2.) Such an analysis would describe physical conditions in the basin that, were they to occur, would result in significant and unreasonable land subsidence that substantially interferes with land uses. 75, 76 The Coordination Agreement's undesirable result definition is further qualified
by the condition that Canal operation require "significant repair or replacement" without
defining what would constitute significant in this context or what types of impacts could
occur that would require repair or replacement. Department staff consider the lack of
clearly defined undesirable results to mean that it would be impossible to understand and
monitor whether the GSPs are managing the Subbasin in a manner that would achieve
the sustainability goal and avoid impacts to land uses and property interests.
Although the Coordination Agreement provides the previously discussed definition of
undesirable results for land subsidence, the Coordination Agreement and five of the six
GSPs define undesirable results due to land subsidence as occurring when 50 percent of the representative monitoring sites exceed their minimum threshold. 77 Neither the
Coordination Agreement or any of the GSPs explain how the 50 percent figure was arrived
at or how operating to that criterion would avoid the significant and unreasonable effects
that would require repairs or replacement especially related to the Canal that is defined as constituting undesirable results. In addition, neither the Coordination Agreement or any of the GSPs explain how it was determined that subsidence was not a matter of concern to other structures or facilities in all other portions of the Subbasin not in
immediate vicinity of the Canal. GSAs are required to define the physical conditions under
which undesirable results would occur, based on an understanding of what conditions
would produce significant and unreasonable effects to land uses and property interests
susceptible to impacts from land subsidence and provide a clear explanation of the criteria

73 Tule Subbasin Coordination Agreement, p. 51. 74 23 CCR § 354.26(b)(2). 75 Water Code ! 10721(x)(5). 76 For the purposes of evaluating different alternatives for the Friant-Kern Canal Middle Reach Capacity Correction Project Feasibility Study, Draft Recommended Plan Report (October 2019), the U.S. Bureau of
Reclamation and the Friant Water Authority evaluated the potential for future land subsidence in the Tule
Subbasin to cause further restrictions on the Friant-Kern Canal capacity. The report is provided as an attachment to a comment letter submitted on the Draft Eastern Tule GSP (Eastern Tule GSP, p 483-484). However, the Eastern Tule GSP does not state that findings from the report was used to support selection of sustainable management criteria. 77 Tule Subbasin Coordination Agreement, p. 51.

California Department of Water Resources
Sustainable Groundwater Management Program Page 14 of 22

GSP Assessment Staff Report San Joaquin Valley Tule Subbasin (No. 5-022.13) January 28, 2022

selected and basis for that selection in the GSP. Although Department staff do not expect a GSP to prove a negative, if predicted levels of subsidence are not expected to substantially interfere with surface land uses in certain areas of the basin, it is incumbent
upon the GSA to describe existing conditions in sufficient detail and in a sufficiently
convincing manner to persuade a reasonable person of that fact. (see Corrective Action
3.)
The sixth GSP, adopted by the Eastern Tule GSA, one of the GSA areas through which
the Canal passes, defines more stringent criteria for undesirable results due to land
subsidence as occurring if any one of their representative monitoring sites exceeds its minimum threshold for land subsidence. 78 This is consistent with the Coordination
Agreement, which states individual GSAs may adopt more stringent criteria than
established in Section 4.3.4.2 of the agreement.79
Minimum Thresholds. All the Tule Subbasin GSPs, except for the Tri-County GSP, define
minimum thresholds for land subsidence using projected land surface elevation during the implementation period (2020 - 2040) derived from the Groundwater Flow Model. The minimum thresholds defined in the GSPs, apart from Tri-County GSP, are generally
determined utilizing the following stepwise process:80
Create a chart with interpolated historical land subsidence at each representative
monitoring site and projected land subsidence at those RMS sites from the
groundwater flow model.
Adjust land subsidence at each representative monitoring site based on elevations
collected in Fall 2019 to establish baseline conditions.
Establish interim milestones based on the projected land subsidence with the
lowest interim milestone during the first 10-years of implementation generally
corresponding to the projected value in 2030.
Evaluate the change in land subsidence, interpolated to the representative monitoring sites, experienced during the "recent drought" from 2007-2016 and
subtract that value from the lowest interim milestone during the initial 10-years of
implementation to establish the minimum threshold.
The Eastern Tule GSP follows the procedure outlined above for establishing minimum
thresholds for land subsidence as four other Tule Subbasin GSPs but limits the
cumulative subsidence along the canal during the period between 2020 and 2040 to a
maximum of 3 feet. Department staff recognize acknowledge that the Eastern Tule GSP

GSP Assessment Staff Report
San Joaquin Valley - Tule Subbasin (No. 5-022.13) January 28, 2022

states that it will develop a Land Subsidence Management and Monitoring Plan;81,82 however, the Eastern Tule GSA does not provide an explanation or justification as to how
the 3-foot maximum of allowable cumulative subsidence threshold would avoid
undesirable results and protect downstream beneficial uses and users of the Canal.
The Tri-County GSP states that existing data on land subsidence in Tri-County plan area
is not considered adequate for developing interim milestones, measurable objectives, and
minimum thresholds. The Tri-County GSP presents three figures illustrating sustainable management criteria for land subsidence in the plan area and states that they are
considered to be tentative, pending collection of data over the next 5 years. 83 As acknowledged in the Coordination Agreement, the Department provides Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (i.e., InSAR) data, which measures vertical ground surface
displacement available through the California Natural Resources Agency data online
platform. The Department encourages the Tri-County GSA and other GSAs in the
subbasin to consult this dataset in addition to other monitoring sites established for land subsidence. 84
The Coordination Agreement and the individual GSPs generally identify land uses and
property interests susceptible to impacts from land subsidence, but do not explain how
they were considered or describe the rationale for establishing minimum thresholds for
land subsidence in consideration of beneficial uses and property interests. (see
Corrective Action 4.) Instead, as mentioned above, the GSPs define sustainable
management criteria for land subsidence based on projected groundwater flow model
output values for the years 2025, 2030, 2035, and 2040 at various representative monitoring sites in the basin.85 Neither the Coordination Agreement nor the individual
GSPs quantify the effects of subsidence on the identified land uses that they seek to avoid
or define minimum thresholds in a manner designed to avoid the effects that would cause
those undesirable results.

Considering the Subbasin has significant historical subsidence and contains
infrastructure that the GSPs identify as both critical and susceptible to future subsidence, Department staff believe that the GSAs should identify the total cumulative amount of subsidence that can occur without causing significant and unreasonable impacts to beneficial uses and users, surface land uses, and property interests. The total cumulative
amount of subsidence should consider the conditions necessary to minimize or halt

Subsidence Management and Monitoring Plan, with an expected adoption of the final plan in WY 2021.

Annual Report, p. 30; Eastern Tule GSA 2019/20 Annual Report, p. 29.; Lower Tule River Irrigation District GSA 2019/2020 Annual Report, p. 28; Pixley Irrigation District GSA 2019/2020 Annual Report, p. 25).

subsidence during GSP implementation and once sustainability has been achieved after
2040. (see Corrective Action 4.)

3.2.3 Corrective Actions
1. For areas defined as adjacent to the Canal in the Eastern Tule GSP, Delano-
Earlimart Irrigation District GSP, and Lower Tule River Irrigation District GSP
areas, the GSAs should identify, through analysis, the total amount of subsidence
that can be tolerated by the Canal during implementation of the GSPs to maintain
the ability to reasonably operate to meet contracted water supply deliveries.
Eastern Tule GSA, Delano-Earlimart Irrigation District GSA, and Lower Tule River
Irrigation District GSA should explain how implementation of the projects and management actions is consistent both with achieving the long-term avoidance or
minimization of subsidence and with not exceeding the tolerable amount of
cumulative subsidence adjacent to the Canal.
a. GSPs adjacent to the Canal should provide an updated description of the
Land Subsidence Management and Monitoring Plan and the associated
subsidence management in the vicinity of the Canal. The GSPs should
include details of any projects, management actions, or mitigation programs associated with the management of land subsidence in the Subbasin. 86
2. For areas not adjacent to the Canal, the GSAs should identify facilities and/or
structures, land uses and property interests that may be susceptible to impacts
from land subsidence and should quantify the amount of land subsidence that
would result in undesirable results. The GSAs should describe the rationale and
any analysis performed to inform the quantification of undesirable results in these
areas.

3. Tule Subbasin GSAs should define the criteria for when undesirable results occur
in the Subbasin based on the results of analyses completed in response to Corrective Actions 1 and 2, the rationale behind the approach, and why it is consistent with avoiding the significant and unreasonable effects identified by the
GSAs.
4. The GSAs should revise their minimum thresholds and measurable objectives for
land subsidence to be consistent with the intent of SGMA that subsidence be
avoided or minimized once sustainability is achieved. In doing that, the GSAs
should identify a cumulative amount of tolerable subsidence that, if exceeded,
would substantially interfere with groundwater and land surface beneficial uses
and users in the Subbasin. The GSPs should explain how the extent of any future
subsidence permitted by the GSPs would not substantially interfere with surface
land uses. The GSAs should explain how implementation of the projects and

86 The Coordination Agreement states that Parties to the Agreement have the intent to work on a mitigation program related to the projected cause of post 2020 land subsidence. (Tule Subbasin Coordination
Agreement, p. 57).

management actions is consistent both with achieving the long-term avoidance or
minimization of subsidence and with not exceeding the tolerable amount of
cumulative subsidence.

3.3 DEFICIENCY 3. THE GSPS DO NOT PROVIDE SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO
JUSTIFY THE PROPOSED SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT CRITERIA FOR
DEGRADED WATER QUALITY

3.3.1 Background SGMA states that a GSP may, but is not required to, address undesirable results that
occurred before, and have not been corrected by, January 1, 2015.87 As a result, the
Tule Subbasin GSPs would not be required to address preexisting undesirable results
associated with degraded water quality. However, management of a basin under an
adopted GSP should not result in further water quality degradation that is significant and unreasonable, either due to routine groundwater use or as a result of implementing projects or management actions called for in the GSP.88 SGMA provides GSAs with legal
authority to regulate and affect pumping and groundwater levels, which can potentially
affect the concentration or migration of water quality constituents and result in
degradation of water quality. Additionally, the GSP Regulations state that GSAs should consider local, state, and federal water quality standards when establishing sustainable management criteria. 89 SGMA provides a GSA with authority to manage and control polluted water and use authorities under existing laws to implement its GSP.90 Thus,
establishing sustainable management criteria and performing routine monitoring of water
quality constituents known to affect beneficial uses and users is within the purview of a
GSA.

3.3.2 Deficiency Details
Undesirable Results. The Coordination Agreement defines an undesirable result due to
degraded water quality as "the significant and unreasonable reduction in groundwater
quality due to groundwater pumping and recharge projects such that the groundwater is
no longer generally suitable for agricultural irrigation and domestic use." 91 The Coordination Agreement adds that "degraded water quality causation will include those changes to groundwater quality caused by recharge or lowering of groundwater elevations."92 The Coordination Agreement states that an undesirable result due to water
quality degradation occurs if 50% of GSA Management Areas representative monitoring
sites exceed their threshold as a result of either groundwater pumping or groundwater
recharge. Four of the GSPs define constituents of concern for municipal and domestic

87 Water Code § 10727.2(b)(4)) 88 Water Code § 10721(×)(4); 23 CCR § 354.28(c)(4). 89 23 CCR § 354.28(c)(4). 90 Water Code §§ 10726.2(e), 10726.8(a). 91 Tule Subbasin Coordination Agreement, p. 50. 92 Tule Subbasin Coordination Agreement, p. 50.

wells as arsenic, chromium, nitrogen as N, and any constituent exceeding the Title 22
MCL at the baseline sampling event to be performed in Spring 2020. 93 The same four GSPs define constituents of concern for agricultural wells as pH, conductivity, and nitrate
as N.94 The Alpaugh GSP and Tri-County GSP do not identify specific constituents of
concerns that would be evaluated for suitability of agricultural irrigation or domestic use.95 The Alpaugh GSP states that shallow groundwater has been de-designated for
agricultural and municipal uses to the west and northwest of the GSA, but that the lower-
aquifer groundwater quality is suitable for agriculture. However, the Alpaugh GSP does
not identify the specific water quality standards that make the water unsuitable or suitable
for agricultural use. 96
The Tule Subbasin Setting states that nitrate concentrations in excess of the MCL of 45
mg/L have been detected historically in wells in the northwest portion of the subbasin. The Tule Subbasin Setting states that elevated nitrate is not an issue for agricultural irrigation or dairy supply but could limit the beneficial use of water from small domestic
supply wells that are impacted. 97 This statement appears to be inconsistent with the
selection of constituents of concern identified in four of the GSPs.

Neither the Coordination Agreement or the individual GSPs include additional discussion of water quality standards that would make water unsuitable for agricultural irrigation or domestic use. Nor do the GSPs justify why pH and conductivity are reasonable proxies to assess degraded water quality for agricultural use. (see Corrective Action 1.)
Measurable Objectives and Minimum Thresholds. Four of the six GSPs98 set measurable
objectives for degraded water quality at 10% above the 10-year running average for each
constituent of concern. The Alpaugh GSP and the Tri-County GSP do not establish
measurable objectives. 99 The Minimum thresholds for degraded water quality are generally set at 15% above the 10-year running average for each constituent of
concern. 100 The GSPs intend the 10-year average to be based on groundwater quality survey measurements made annually, beginning in 2020. 101 It is Department staff's
understanding that the 10-year running average will be calculated annually using the

previous 10 annual measurements (or less, if 10 annual measurements are unavailable).
The value derived from the 10-year running average will be multiplied by 1.1 and 1.15 to
establish the next year's measurable objective and minimum threshold, respectively.
The GSPs do not explain how continued degradation of groundwater quality, which is a potential consequence of using a running 10-year average for minimum thresholds and
measurable objectives, will avoid groundwater quality conditions that are not generally
suitable for agricultural irrigation and drinking water use. This allowable continued
degradation approach appears incapable of maintaining water quality above known water quality standards for agricultural irrigation and domestic use. Without a discussion of what
is considered suitable for agricultural irrigation and domestic use, or a discussion of how
the proposed sustainable management criteria relate to existing groundwater quality regulatory requirements in the Subbasin (e.g., Irrigated Lands Regulatory Program, Drinking Water Standards, Central Valley Salinity Alternatives for Long-Term
Sustainability, etc.), Department staff cannot assess whether the proposed sustainable
management criteria will avoid undesirable results. Further, the GSAs do not explain how
minimum thresholds may affect the interest of beneficial uses and users of groundwater in the Subbasin.102 (see Corrective Action 2 and 3.)
3.3.3 Corrective Actions
The Tule Subbasin GSPs should be revised to include a discussion of:

1. What groundwater quality conditions are considered suitable for agricultural
irrigation and domestic use using the best available information and science,
including information from existing groundwater quality programs, agencies, and regulatory standards. The GSPs should also explain why ph and conductivity in
addition to nitrate are suitable constituents to evaluate impacts to beneficial uses
and users, especially agricultural irrigation.
2. How and why the 10-year running average is being applied to set sustainable management criteria, especially if baseline conditions had not been established at the time the GSPs were submitted. How the sustainable management criteria for
degraded water quality will avoid undesirable results due to degraded groundwater
quality and relate potential effects of the undesirable results to existing regulatory standards. Clarify how the criteria defining when undesirable results occur in the
Subbasin were established, the rationale behind the approach, and why it is
consistent with avoiding the significant and unreasonable effects associated with
groundwater pumping and other aspects of the GSAs' implementation of their
GSPs. Additionally, the GSPs should describe and disclose how the GSAs will
assess whether any future degradation in groundwater quality is due to
groundwater pumping and recharge projects occurring during GSP
implementation.

3. How the sustainable management criteria for degraded water quality relate to
existing groundwater quality regulatory requirements in the Subbasin and how the
GSAs will coordinate with existing agencies and programs to assess whether or
not implementation of the GSPs are contributing to the degradation of water quality
throughout the Subbasin.

Department staff believe that the deficiencies identified in this assessment should
preclude approval of the Plan for the Tule Subbasin. Department staff recommend that
the Plan be determined incomplete.
