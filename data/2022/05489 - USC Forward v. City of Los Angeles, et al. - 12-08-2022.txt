22 INTRODUCTION

23 1. By this action, Petitioner USC Forward challenges the unlawful actions of the City

24 of Los Angeles and City Council of the City of Los Angeles ("City" or "Respondent") in

25 approving a proposed four-story, 30,218 square foot structure which includes 96 bedrooms each

26 with a dedicated bathroom (i.e., 96 bathrooms) ("Project"), which the Real Party applicants Ziyi

27 Yang and Tripalink, Corp. ("Real Parties") claim to be ten single-family dwelling units located at

28
-1-

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 1840 West Adams Boulevard ("Project"). In furtherance of the Project, Real Parties sought City

2 approval of a Vesting Tentative Tract Map No. 83081-SL-HCA to subdivide the Project site into

3 10 new small lots (*VTT") via a Class 32/Class 15 Categorical Exemption ("CatEx") from the

4 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") (collectively "Project Approvals").

5 2. There is substantial evidence in the record showing Real Parties' pattern-and-

6 practice of operating co-living facilities that serve almost exclusively college students near

7 University of Southern California ("USC"') campus. No reasonable person could conclude that the

8 Project will operate as a maximum of 10 single family dwelling units. Real Parties commonly

9 rent each bedroom here amounting to not ten (10) single family dwelling units but rather 96

10 individual student housing units akin to "efficiency dwelling units," "dormitories," or guest

11 rooms in boarding house. (See Los Angeles Municipal Code ("LAMC" or "Code") § 12.03

12 [definitions].)

13 3. This Project violates the LAMC and CEQA. The approximately 14,000 square

14 foot Project site is allowed a maximum density of only 35 dwelling units. There is substantial

15 evidence showing the Project will operate as 96 independent student housing units - which

16 exceeds the objective 35-unit maximum allowed under applicable LAMC zoning regulations.

17 This also violates CEQA because the CatEx requires the Project to be, among other things,

18 consistent "with applicable zoning designations and regulations." (CEQA Guidelines § 15332.)

19 4. On October 11, 2022, the City's Planning and Land Use Management

20 ("PLUM") Committee (chaired by Councilmember Marqueece Harris-Dawson who represents

21 the Council District where the Project Site is located) heard Petitioner's Appeal of the VTT

22 filed on August 22, 2022 ("Appeal"), as well as the CEQA CatEx compliance, and

23 unanimously agreed with Petitioner to grant Petitioner's Appeal to overturn the South Los
24 Angeles Area Planning Commision's approval of the VTT and CatEx. Chair Harris-Dawson

25 spoke strongly in favor of the Appeal.

26 5. The PLUM Committee drafted written Appeal findings on October 11, 2022, as

27 follows:

28
-2•

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

- "the Project is not exempt from CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines, Section 15332,

2 Class 32 (Infill Development Projects), and there is substantial evidence demonstrating

3 that an exception to categorical exemption pursuant to CEQA Guidelines, Section

4 15300.2 applies.
u
6 The project is a classic dormitory-style housing. The applicant portrays this project as a

7 homeownership opportunity, but it is very far from it. Several units are over 10 bedrooms

8 and 10 bathrooms. The layout of the building as shown on plans submitted to the Planning|

9 Department with the location of the kitchen and rooms off

10 the stairwells on each floor is indicative that this is a dormitory and not 10 single

11 dwelling homes. This dormitory ought to be, but was not, studied and analyzed as a

12 student housing dormitory with over 90 units.

13

14 This project is inconsistent with the Community Plan Implementation Overlay Zone and

15 the community plan because it is out of proportion when analyzed in its proper context. If

16 analyzed appropriately, this project will be above the threshold of traffic noise and air

17 quality.

18

19 When it comes to this project, the Class 32 Categorical Exemption is deficient in that the

20 first requirement that the project be "consistent with the applicable general plan

21 designation and all applicable general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning

22 designation and regulations" did not include an adequate consistency analysis.

23

24 is There is substantial evidence in the administrative record to support the Appellant's

25 allegations that the City has erred in its judgment for purposes of CEQA and the use of

26 the Class 32 Categorical Exemption that the Project is consistent with the applicable

27 zoning regulations. Therefore, the CEQA is insufficient because the description of the

28
-3-

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

- project is wholly inaccurate previously stated. As a result, this tract map cannot be

2 approved because the environmental analysis and the categorical exemption is

3 insufficient. Therefore, we want to grant the appeal. If the applicant submits a project

4 with an accurate and updated project description, then the department of planning can
un properly evaluate it.
6

7 Greater Page Temple has reached out to our office. Their congregation is against this

8 project as they represent one of the most important historical buildings in West Adams.

9 The CPIO also has a subarea that protects the historical character of the homes

10 immediately south of the building known as the Victor Hall Tract and that has not been

11 properly studied.

12

13 In addition, the City has failed to analyze the cumulative impacts of the proliferation of

14 student housing in the area, and the City has recognized the negative impacts of multi-

15 habitable room projects in the adjacent area through the establishment of the

16 Neighborhood Stabilization Ordinance. In addition, as stated above, the analysis of

17 cumulative impacts related to air quality, construction noise and construction related

18 transportation is not adequate to support the determination in the narrative supporting

19 the Class 32 exemption failure to analyze the surrounding student housing projects."

20 6. The Appeal and the PLUM findings were scheduled for a full Council vote

21 a usually a consent item unless called special by a councilmember - for October 14, 2022.

22 However, Council meetings were cancelled due to public uproar over the racist statements of

23 certain City councilmembers recorded on audiotapes made public on or about October 9, 2022.

24 7. On October 14, 2022, the City Clerk unlawfully and erroneously issued a

25 Memorandum ("Memo") claiming Appellant's Appeal, as well as the independently-filed appeal

26 by the West Adams Neighborhood Association ("WANA"), had been "deemed denied" under

27

28
-4.

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 Cal. Government Code § 66452.5 due to the City Council's failure to act on the VTT by October

2 14, 2022 when Council meetings were cancelled due to the audiotapes' aftermath.

3 8. On October 25, 2022, the City filed a CEQA Notice of Exemption (*NOE") for the

4 Project triggering a 35 day period to sue. Petitioner was given no notice of the Memo or NOE,

5 and had to find these documents from periodic internet searches.

6 9. On November 18 and 25, 2022, Petitioner mailed and e-mailed a CEQA Notice of

7 Intent to Sue pursuant to Pub. Res. Code § 21167.5 objecting to the Memo and NOE.

8 Specifically, Petitioner asked that the City Clerk retract the Memo, and that the City retract the

9 NOE and process the Appeal. The Petitioner noted that the State and City remained in a COVID

10 State of Emergency and that the City's Mayor on January 28, 2022 issued an Emergency Order to

11 "toll all Zoning Code provisions regarding the Time to Act on filed applications" including the

12 Project's VTT application. Petitioner reminded the Clerk that Deputy City Attorney Ernesto

13 Vasquez in this very case and Project had confirmed on the record that all VTT "deemed

14 denied" timelines in this case were tolled under the Mayor's Emergency Order.

15 10. Petitioner also noted that the Appeal hearing involved CEQA, that CEQA appeals

16 cannot be "deemed denied," and that CEQA appeals must be heard by the highest elected

17 decisionmaker. Neither the City CEQA Procedures nor state law contain a "deemed denied" or

18 similar provision. (See LAMC § 11.5.13; see also Pub. Res. Code § 21151(c); CEQA Guidelines

19 §15090(b).) Further, under LAMC § 11.5.13.D, the VTT approval is stayed and not final until all

20 CEQA appeals are resolved.

21 11. Finally, Petitioner wrote that the NOE must be withdrawn. The CEQA Appeal

22 should still be pending and a NOE cannot be filed until all appeals are done. (See e.g., Coalition

23 for Clean Air v. City of Visalia (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 408, 418, 425 [a prematurely filed notice

24 of CEQA exemption is "invalid"]; County of Amador v. El Dorado County Water Agency (1999)

25 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 963, fn. 16 [holding notice of CEQA exemption cannot be filed until after

26 the project is approved, a "contrary conclusion would be tantamount to requiring opponents to

27 bring challenges before a project is finally approved, lest they be barred by the statute of

28

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 limitations. It would also thwart attempts to resolve disputes over a project."]. This same caselaw

2 instructs that the City cannot approve the Project's VTT and trigger the timeline to sue without a

3 final CEQA approval for the Project.

4 12. On November 23, 2002, City Clerk Jenna Monterrosa wrote to Petitioner that the

5 Appeal "was deemed denied on or about October 14, 2022 pursuant to Government Code, section

6 66452.5, this email shall serve to provide your client with notice that its appeal of Vesting

7 Tentative Tract Map application VTT-83081-SL-HCA-2A was deemed denied on or about

8 October 14, 2022 and that all administrative appeals of the Project approval have been

9 exhausted." She wrote that "therefore, pursuant to LAMC 11.5.13(C), your client has fifteen (15)

10 days from the date of this email, on or before December 8, 2022, to file an appeal of the CEQA

11 exemption determination for the project. City Planning's CEQA application is linked below for

12 your reference and may be submitted through our Online Application System." Petitioner intends

13 to file the CEQA appeal on or about November 28, 2022.

14 13. On November 23, 2002, Deputy City Attorney John Fox courteously wrote to

15 Petitioner to confirm that although the NOE was not withdrawn, "with regard to the NOE once a

16 timely and valid CEQA appeal is filed the NOE that was previously filed would not have any

17 legal effect with regard to the statute of limitations." Real Parties, however, have not confirmed

18 that they agree.

19 14. This lawsuit follows. In the first cause of action for violation of the LAMC, the

20 lawsuit challenges both the procedure and substance of the VTT denial. In the second cause of

21 action for violation of CEQA, the suit complies with the statute of limitations to sue on the

22 premature NOE that the City has not withdrawn, seeks withdrawal of the premature NOE for,

23 inter alia, the reason stated by Deputy City Attorney Fox, and alleges procedural and substantive

24 violations of CEQA.

25

26 / This action potentially can be dismissed without prejudice when: 1) Petitioner's forthcoming
27 CEQA appeal of the Project is accepted, 2) the City stays the VTT Approval under LAMC 11.5.13.D until the CEQA appeal is decided, and 3) the CEQA appeal is decided in Petitioner's
28 favor.

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 JURISDICTION

2 15. This Court has jurisdiction under Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168 or 21168.5 (CEQA

3 actions), Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1085 or 1094.5 (mandamus actions). The Project Site is located in

4 the County of Los Angeles. The within action has been timely brought within 90 days of Project

5 Approval pursuant to Gov. Code § 65009. Under Pub. Res. Code § 21167, the within action has

6 been timely brought within 35 days of the (premature) NOE. In compliance with Pub. Res. Code

7 § 21167.5, Petitioner served a Notice of Intent to File this Petition on the Clerk of the City by

8 mail on November 18 and 25, 2022 as reflected in Exhibit A hereto. Concurrent with the filing of

9 this action, Petitioner will notify the Attorney General of the State of California of the filing of

10 the action in accordance with Pub. Res. Code § 21167.7.

11 PARTIES

12 16. Petitioner USC Forward is an unincorporated association comprised of a broad

13 coalition of community organizations, students, and SEIU Local 721 union members united to

14 make USC a better neighbor and accountable to its surrounding communities. Its members live

15 and/or work in the vicinity of the Project Site, breathe the air, suffer traffic congestion, and suffer

16 other environmental impacts of the Project unless it is properly analyzed and mitigated. Petitioner

17 is committed to ensuring responsible development in Los Angeles, that local land-use

18 rules/regulations are followed, and informed decision-making by public officials regarding

19 projects that may significantly impact the environment in the City. This Project that may usurp

20 true single family housing opportunities amidst an affordable housing crisis in South Los Angeles

21 violates these principles and negatively impacts Petitioner and its members. Its interests will be

22 directly affected by the Project and the City's failure to comply with the requirements of the

23 LAMC and CEQA. Petitioner participated in the Project Approval processes by submission of

24 written and oral comments and filing the Appeal.

25 17. Respondent City is a local governmental Charter City in Los Angeles County,

26 California. The City approved all the Project Approvals.

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 18. Real Party in Interest Tripalink, Corp. is a Delaware corporation doing business

2 under the laws of the State of California with its principal place of business in Los Angeles, CA,

3 which is believed to be the recipient of the Project Approvals. Real Party in Interest individual

4 Ziyi Yang is listed with Tripalink, Corp. on the NOE and also is believed to be the recipient of a

5 Project Approvals.

6 19. The true names, capacities, corporate, associate or otherwise of Respondents and

7 Real Parties named herein as DOES 1 through 10, inclusive, are unknown to Petitioner who,

8 therefore, sue said Respondents and Real Parties by fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this

9 Petition to show the true names and capacities when they have been ascertained.

10 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

11 (Writ of Mandate and Administrative Mandamus - Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1085, 1094.5 -

12 Violations of City Code)

13 20. Petitioner restates and reallege Paragraphs 1-19 as if fully set forth herein.

14 21. There are two essential requirements to the issuance of an ordinary writ of

15 mandate under Code Civ. Proc. section 1085: (1) a clear, present and ministerial duty on the part

16 of the respondent, and (2) a clear, present and beneficial right on the part of the Petitioner to the

17 performance of that duty. (California Assn. for Health Services at Home v. Department

18 of Health Services (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 696, 704.) "An action in ordinary mandamus is

19 proper where the claim is that an agency has failed to act as required by law." (Id. at 705.)

20 22. Actions involving quasi-judicial zoning approvals, such as the case here, are

21 subject to an abuse of discretion standard, which is established when the local agency: (a) has not

22 proceeded in the manner required by law; (b) the decision is not supported by findings; and/or (c)

23 the evidence does not support the findings. Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.5.

24 23. While planning agencies enjoy some discretion interpreting their zoning laws,

25 "deference has limits" and courts are not bound by unreasonable interpretations contrary to the

26 plain language of regulations and statutes. (Orange Citizens for Parks & Recreation v. Superior

27 Court (2016) 2 Cal.5th 141, 146, 156-157 [rejecting attempts to "downplay the facial

28
-8-

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 inconsistency," Court held city abused its discretion finding residential project consistent with

2 general plan designation where "no reasonable person could conclude that the Property could be

3 developed without a general plan amendment"]; see also Stolman v. City of Los Angeles (2003)

4 114 Cal.App.4th 916, 928-930 [vacating variance based on zoning administrator's interpretation

5 contradicted by the plain language of the municipal code].)

6 24. Invalid "Deemed Denial" Of VTT Appeal. The City Clerk Memo and the

7 "deemed denial" of the VTT Appeal (and the WANA appeal) are a procedural abuse of discretion

8 that the City has a clear, ministerial duty to withdraw. The Court should issue a writ of mandate

9 and declaration of law declaring this so, and also declaring that the VTT is stayed and not final

10 pursuant to LAMC § 11.5.13.D pending resolution of future CEQA appeal(s) concerning the

11 Project. The State and City remain in a COVID State of Emergency and the City's Mayor on

12 January 28, 2022 issued an Emergency Order to "toll all Zoning Code provisions regarding the

13 Time to Act on filed applications." Deputy City Attorney Ernesto Vasquez in this very case and

14 Project confirmed on the record that all "deemed denied" timelines in this case were tolled

15 under the Mayor's Emergency Order. The City is equitably estopped flom flip-flopping to now

16 assert otherwise. Petitioner relied on this tolling confirmation by Deputy City Attorney Vasquez

17 to its detriment in not assuring the City Council heard the Appeal under the Government Code

18 timelines. The Government Code timelines are tolled by the State and City State of Emergency.

19 Gov. Code § 66452.5(c)(2) incorporates local law and a VTT appeal can only be deemed denied

20 for a Project "insofar as it complies with applicable requirements of .. . local ordinance," which

21 this Project does not.? So too, this provision of the Government Code does not apply here where

22 the last action taken by the City here at PLUM Committee on October 11, 2022 - was to reject

23 the VTT. So too, the City cannot approve the Project's VTT and trigger the timeline to sue

24 without a final CEQA approval for the Project.

25 The inadequacies in the Project application cited by the PLUM Committee support a conclusion that the Project application failed to comply with City ordinances requiring that the tentative
26 parcel map contain an accurate Project description and all information required for a final parcel map. "The applicant portrays this project as a homeownership opportunity, but it is very far from
27 it." Deficiencies of this sort alone would prevent application of the "deemed approval" language of the statute. (See Pongputmong v. City of Santa Monica, (1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 99, 104-105
28 [applications failing to comply with local law cannot be considered deemed approved].)
-9.

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 25. The Memo and the "deemed denial" of the VTT Appeal are an abuse of discretion

2 that must be reversed in light of the State of Emergency Order, the tolling representations of the

3 Deputy City Attorney, the impossibility of conducting Council meetings after release of the racist

4 audiotapes and the fact that the Project's CEQA approval is not final.

5 26. This result does not prejudice Real Parties who lost at PLUM Committee, and

6 must face the unambiguously negative findings authored by the PLUM Committee and its Chair

7 who represents the Project area. Real Parties (it seems to Petitioner) are taking advantage of the

8 COVID State of Emergency and the uproar over racism at City Hall to get an out-of-scale

9 dormitory Project approved as single family housing in violation of the City's zoning rules -

10 usurping true single family housing opportunities amidst an affordable housing crisis in South

11 Los Angeles.

12 27. Invalid VTT Findings. To the extent the VTT is "deemed denied," the denial is

13 an abuse of discretion on the substance. The City failed to support the Code required VTT

14 findings with substantial evidence. (See Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community v. County of Los

15 Angeles (1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 515 [this inquiry may not be perfunctory or mechanically

16 superficial, but requires the agency to "set forth findings to bridge the analytic gap between the

17 raw evidence and ultimate decision or order"]; see also West Chandler Boulevard Neighborhood

18 Assn. V. City of Los Angeles (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 1506, 1522 [city abused its discretion when

19 it "acted on evidence not in the record" where the "conclusory findings did not show how the city

20 council traveled from evidence to action"].) As the PLUM Committee chaired by Councilmember

21 Harris-Dawson confirmed, the Project is inconsistent with the LAMC, South Los Angeles

22 Community Plan Implementation Overlay ("CPIO") Zone and the South Los Angeles Community

23 Plan because it is out of proportion when analyzed in its proper a context as a ninety-six (96) unit

24 dormitory. Under the Code, the approximately 14,142 square foot Project site is zoned C-2, which

25 requires a minimum of 400 square feet of lot area per dwelling unit and, thus, allows a maximum

26 density of only 35 dwelling units. (See LAMC §§ 12.14.C.3 [C-2 zone incorporates R4 Zone lot

27 area requirements] & 12.11.C.4 [400 square feet lot area per dwelling unit].) There is substantial

28
-10-

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 evidence showing the Project will operate as 96 independent student housing units-which exceeds

2 the objective 35-unit maximum allowed under the LAMC. So too, the Project amounts to roughly

3 147 square feet of lot area per unit, which violates the minimum residential density under the

4 applicable South Los Angeles CPIO District - both generally (i.e., 1 unit per 800 square feet) and

5 for Density Bonus or Transit-Oriented Communities projects (i.e., 1 unit per 400 square feet).

6 (See South Los Angeles CPIO, p. 32 [Section II-2-B.1].) All these deficiencies violate the

7 various Code-required findings necessary to grant the VTT including but not limited to that the

8 Project must be consistent with applicable general and specific plans and that the site is physically

9 suitable for the type of development. (See e.g., Cal. Gov. Code §§ 66473.1, 66474.60-.63;

10 LAMC §§ 17.02-06.)

11 28. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law other than the relief

12 sought in this Petition. If the City persists in its refusal to rescind the Project's VTT, and if City

13 and Real Party are not enjoined or stayed from undertaking acts in furtherance of the construction

14 of ther Project, Petitioner and the public will suffer irreparable harm from which there is no

15 adequate remedy at law in that the Project will be built in viiolation of the LAMC, operations

16 commence and significant adverse impacts on the environment would occur, contrary to

17 governing law.

18 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

19 (Writ of Mandamus - Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1085, 1094.5 - CEQA Violations)

20 29. Petitioner restates and reallege Paragraphs 1-28 as if fully set forth herein.

21 30. Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1085, 1094.5, Petitioner seek a writ of mandate to

22 overturn the Project Approvals for CEQA violations including the premature NOE and improper

23 CatEx.

24 31. Premature NOE. The NOE must be withdrawn or invalidated. The CEQA Appeal

25 should still be pending and a NOE cannot be filed until all appeals are done. Neither CEQA nor

26 the LAMC allow CEQA appeals to be "deemed denied." Under the Code, "[t]he City Council

27 a shall hold a public hearing before acting on the appeal." § (See LAMC § 11.5.13.E [emph. added].)

28
-11-

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 So too, state CEQA law requires the Council to hear the CEQA appeal (and contains no deemed

2 denial provision). (Pub. Res. Code § 21151(c).)

3 32. The Government Code Subdivision Map Act timelines to not apply to CEQA.

4 (Eller Media Co. v. City of Los Angeles (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1220 [imposing an

5 automatic approval process on CEQA is not dictated by the terms of CEQA and where time to act

6 is measured from specific actions under CEQA no relief for failure to abide by time limits

7 available where record shows acts required by CEQA not yet completed]; Riverwatch v. County

8 of San Diego (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 1428, 1438-1439.) Gov. Code section 66542.5 mandates

9 automatic approval only if the agency has failed to comply with the time limits specified in "this

10 chapter" which applies to the Subdivision Map Act only - not CEQA. If the CEQA time limits

11 were construed as being governed by the Subdivision Map Act, projects such as this one could be

12 deemed approved even though a substantive CEQA requirement had not been met, thereby

13 undermining the base purpose of CEQA by permitting the development of projects resulting in

14 unacceptable environmental consequences.

15 33. The City Clerk has confirmed that the CatEx is still subject to an appeal and

16 Petitioner intends to file a CEQA appeal challenging the CatEx on or about November 28, 2022.

17 Deputy City Attorney John Fox wrote to Petitioner that although the NOE was not withdrawn,

18 that once this "valid CEQA appeal is filed" the NOE "would not have any legal effect with regard

19 to the statute of limitations." The NOE which was prematurely filed to trigger the statute of

20 limitations prejudices Petitioner's rights. It is not withdrawn. Petitioner has been left no choice

21 but to sue to preserve its rights. a The City has a clear, ministerial duty to withdraw the NOE. The

22 Court should issue a writ of mandate and declaration of law declaring this so as to Petitioner,

23 WANA and the public.

24 34. Invalid CatEx. The CatEx requires the Project to be, among other things,

25 consistent "with applicable zoning designations and regulations" (CEQA Guidelines § 15332)

26 which this Project is not. As the PLUM Committee chaired by Councilmember Harris-Dawson

27 confirmed, the Project is not exempt from CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines, Section 15332,

28
-12-

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 Class 32 (Infill Development Projects), and there is substantial evidence demonstrating that an

2 exception to a categorical exemption pursuant to CEQA Guidelines, Section 15300.2 applies.

3 This project is inconsistent with the LAMC, CPIO and the South Los Community Plan because it

4 is out of proportion when analyzed in its proper context. This dooms the CatEx - both Class 15

5 and 32 require zoning consistency. The CatEx is an abuse of discretion that lacks substantial

6 evidence. If analyzed appropriately, this Project will be above the threshold of traffic noise and

7 air quality. The historical character of the homes immediately south of the building known as the

8 Victor Hall Tract and that has not been properly studied and there will be significant impacts to

9 historic resources. As the PLUM Committee further noted, "[t]he analysis of cumulative impacts

10 related to air quality, construction noise and construction related transportation is not adequate to

11 support the determination in the narrative supporting the Class 32 exemption failure to analyze

12 the surrounding student housing projects."

13 35. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law other than the relief

14 sought in this Petition. If the City persists in its refusal to rescind the NOE, and if City and Real

15 Parties are not enjoined or stayed from undertaking acts in furtherance of the Project construction,

16 Petitioner and the public will suffer irreparable harm from which there is no adequate remedy at

17 law in that the Project will be built in violation of CEQA, operations commence and significant

18 adverse impacts on the environment would occur, contrary to State and local law.

19 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

20 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for the following relief:

21 1. That the Court enters a peremptory writ of mandate and declaration ordering the

22 City to set aside and void the NOE and Project Approvals, pending the City's full compliance

23 with the LAMC, State law, and all other applicable land use laws and regulations, and CEQA

24 including preparation of appropriate CEQA documentation and zoning findings;

25 2. That the Court issue a temporary stay, stay, temporary restraining order, and/or

26 preliminary injunction ordering the City, Real Parties, and (its) their agents and successors to

27

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 refrain from proceeding with the Project, VTT or issuing further Project permits while this

3 3. That the Court issue a permanent injunction ordering the City and Real Parties to

4 refrain from proceeding with the Project pending the City's full compliance with the LAMC,

5 State law, and all other applicable land use laws and regulations, and CEQA including

6 preparation of appropriate CEQA documentation and zoning findings; and

7 4. For other and further relief as the Court finds proper under the Code of Civil

8 Procedure.

RE: 1840 W. ADAMS BLVD. CEQA APPEAL (COUNCIL FILE No. 22-1055);
DCP CASE NOs. VTT-83081-SL-HCA-2A, ENV-2020-3308-CE);
NOTICE OF INTENT TO FILE CEQA ACTION

Dear City Clerk:
On behalf of USC Forward ("Petitioner"), this office provides this letter to the City of Los
Angeles ("City") in accordance with Pub. Res. Code § 21167.5.

Please take notice that pursuant to Pub. Res. Code § 21167, Petitioners will file a Petition for Writ of Mandate ("Petition") challenging the City's approval of the above-referenced development including the proposed demolition of a single-story commercial unit and construction of a four-
story, 96-bed, and 96-bath structure located at 1840 W. Adams Boulevard ("Project"). In furtherance of the Project, the applicant sought City approval of a Vesting Tentative Tract Map No. 83081-SL-HCA to subdivide the Project site into ten new small lots ("VTT") via a Class 32/Class 15 Categorical Exemption ("CE") from California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA").
On October 11, the Planning and Land Use Management Committee voted to grant Petitioner's appeal of the Project's VTT-in effect, overturning the VTT and CE approvals
(collectively "Project Approvals"). However, according to the City Clerk Memorandum dated October 14, 2022 ("Memo"), the VTT appeal was 'deemed denied' due to the City Council's failure to
act on the VTT by October 14, 2022 when it canceled City Council meetings due to racist
audiotapes.1 On October 25, 2022, the applicant filed a CEQA Notice of Exemption ("NOE").

To preserve its rights, Petitioners will file the forthcoming Petition that will allege, among
other things, that the Project did not comply with CEQA due to the premature filing of the NOE and
improperly relying on an inadequate CE (e.g., land use inconsistency, traffic, air quality, etc.) Petitioner will seek to have the Project Approvals enjoined and set aside, along with such other relief as the Court deems proper.

Sincerely, LAW OFFICE OF GIDEON KRACOV

DCP CASE NOS. VTT-83081-SL-HCA-2A, ENV-2020-3308-CE);
REQUEST TO CITY CLERK TO RETRACT DEEMED DENIED MEMO;
NOTICE OF INTENT TO FILE CEQA ACTION

Dear Hon. City Councilmembers and City Clerk Wolcott:

On behalf of USC Forward ("Appellant"), this office provides this letter to the City of Los
Angeles ("City") regarding the above-referenced "Appeal" filed pursuant to the Los Angeles Municipal Code ("LAMC" or "Code") § 11.5.13 and the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). The Appeal challenges the proposed demolition of a single-story commercial unit and
construction of a four-story, 96-bed, and 96-bath structure located at 813-815 West Olympic
Boulevard ("Project"). In furtherance of the Project, the applicant sought City approval of a Vesting Tentative Tract Map No. 83081-SL-HCA to subdivide the Project site into ten new small lots ("VTT") via a Class 32/Class 15 Categorical Exemption from CEQA ("CE"). On October 11, the Planning and
Land Use Management Committee voted to grant the Appeal-in effect overturning the VTT and CE approvals (collectively "Project Approvals").

Recently, Appellant has learned of the City Clerk Memorandum dated October 14, 2022
("Memo") claiming Appellant's Appeal, as well as the independently-filed CEQA appeal by the West Adams Neighborhood Association ("WANA"), have been "deemed denied" due to the City Council's failure to act on the VTT by October 14, 2022 when it canceled City Council meetings due to racist audiotapes.1 Additionally, we are now aware that the applicant has filed a CEQA Notice of
Exemption ("NOE") on October 25, 2022-thus, triggering a 35 day period to sue.2 We were given
zero notice of the Memo or NOE and had to find it ourselves through internet searches.

For the reasons discussed below, we request the City Clerk retract the Memo, that the City
retract the NOE, and process the Appeal. Otherwise, absent a tolling agreement between the parties
(i.e., applicant, City, applicant), Appellant provides notice pursuant with Pub. Res. Code § 21167.5 of its
intent to file a lawsuit challenging the Project Approval on the grounds of non-compliance with CEQA
and other applicable zoning laws ("Action").

/1/

See https://clkrep.lacity.org/onlinedocs/2022/22-1055_misc_10-14-22.pdf.
2 See L.A. County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk (accessed 11/18/22) (search File No. 2022233074, Project Title Tripalink Co-Living Townhomes), https://apps.lavote.net/CEQA/Search/Results#res.

First, the City Clerk must retract the Memo given the deadline to act on the VTT was tolled and
extended due the COVID emergency. Deputy City Attorney Ernesto Vasquez made it clear that the COVID state of emergency has tolled VTT deadlines in this case. In July 2022, during WANA's appeal of the VTT at the South L.A. Area Planning Commission ("ACP"), the applicant made similar claims that WANA's VTT appeal was 'deemed denied' by operation of law because APC did not act within the timeframes under the Code.3 However, according to Deputy City Attorney Ernesto Vasquez,
timelines to act under the Code have been tolled due to the COVID emergency.4 Mr. Vasquez, who
serves as counsel to both Central L.A. and South L.A. APCs, made these statements just three weeks
before the South L.A. APC heard WANA's original appeal and in direct response to the concerns raised about appeals being considered deemed denied.5 It is arbitrary and capricious for the City to now deem Appellant's Appeal denied by operation of law when it has already rejected similar arguments on the record that make it clear that deadlines have been extended. The COVID state of emergency has not been lifted and is in effect until 2023.6 This type of situation is where courts step in and estop arbitrary procedural barriers imposed by government.?

Second, this is a CEQA appeal, and CEQA appeals cannot be 'deemed denied.' Under the Code, only some appeals may be considered "deemed denied" by the City's unconsented delay. (See e.g.,
LAMC § 17.06.4 [VTT appeals], § 17.54.A [preliminary Parcel Map appeals], § 11.5.7 subds., C.6(c) &
F.7 [Project Permit Compliance Review appeal].) Here, neither the City's CEQA Procedures nor state law contains a 'deemed denied' or similar provision. (See LAMC § 11.5.13; see also Pub. Res. Code
21151(c); CEQA Guidelines §15090(b).) If the City wanted CEQA appeals to be subject to a 'deemed denied' proviso, it would have codified such language (as it has done in other circumstances cited above). (See Preven v. City of Los Angeles (2019) 32 Cal.App.5th 925, 935 [where Legislature uses language in other laws but not law at issue, its shows "it knew how to say so clearly" and "fact that the Legislature chose not to do so is evidence of its intent not to"].)

Third, the NOE must be retracted as premature. The CEQA Appeal should still be pending and a NOE cannot be filed until all appeals are done. (See e.g., Coalition for Clean Air v. City of Visalia (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 408, 418, 425 [a prematurely filed notice of CEQA exemption is "invalid"]; County of Amador v. El Dorado County Water Agency (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 963, fn. 16 [holding notice of CEQA exemption cannot be filed until after the project is approved, a "contrary conclusion would be tantamount to requiring opponents to bring challenges before project is finally

See e.g., Shuer v. County of San Diego (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 476, 487 ("We find, however, that the sum total of county's actions ... negligently led [the plaintiff] to conclude that she had no administrative recourse. That being the case, county is estopped from asserting in its demurrer that [the plaintiff] failed to exhaust her administrative remedies."); Feduniak v. California Coastal Com. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 1346, 1372 ("[C]ourts will not hesitate to estop the government from asserting a procedural barrier, such as the statute of limitations or a failure to exhaust remedies, as a defense to claims against it, where the government's affirmative conduct caused the claimant's failure to comply with the procedural requirement."); J.H. McKnight Ranch, Inc. v. Franchise Tax Bd. (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 978, 991.

approved, lest they be barred by the statute of limitations. It would also thwart attempts to resolve
disputes over a project."].)

For these reasons, the City must retract the Memo, retract the NOE, and process Appellant's
Appeal. If not, and if the City continues to assert the 'deemed denied' position, and absent a tolling agreement, Appellant will file an Action alleging that the City abused its discretion under CEQA by approving all the Project Approvals and will seek to have the Project Approvals set aside, along with
such other relief as the Court deems proper including fees. We will use the transcript of the PLUM hearing and PLUM's revised findings of fact granting the Appeal to prove the case.8
Because time is of the essence, please respond immediately to me at the number above.
Thank you for your consideration.
