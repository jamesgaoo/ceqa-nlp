RE: Notice to Attorney General of Commencement of Action Against
The California Department of Water Resources

To the Attorney General of the State of California:

Please take notice, under Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of
Civil Procedure section 388, that on July 29, 2022, Save Public Access to the Milburn
Area ("Petitioner") filed a petition for writ of mandate (the "Petition") pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, and California Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"), against the California Department of Water Resources ("DWR"). The Petition challenges DWR's June 29, 2022, approval and certification of the Environmental Impact Report for the Milburn Pond Isolation Project (*Project"). The lawsuit is based on violations of CEQA, as discussed more fully in the Project's administrative and environmental review proceedings. The exact nature of the allegations and relief sought is described in the Petition and is attached to this notice as
Exhibit 1.

INTRODUCTION

2 Petitioner Save Public Access to the Milburn Area (*Petitioner") petitions this Court for a

3 writ of mandate directed to Respondent California Department of Water Resources ("DWR" or

4 "Respondent"), alleging as follows:

5 1. On June 29, 2022, DWR approved a project that it identifies as the Milburn Pond

6 Isolation Project ("Project), which is the subject of this action. DWR also certified an

7 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the Project pursuant to the California Environmental

8 Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.) ("CEQA") and the CEQA Guidelines (Cal.

9 Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15000 et seq.).

10 2. The area that DWR identifies as "Milburn Pond" is more accurately described as

11 the "Milburn Area" it because it includes different ponds and areas, and at least one of these ponds

12 has always been completely within the San Joaquin River channel below the high-water mark.

13 Further, the portion of Milburn Area that was subject to historic mining has predominantly also

14 been located within the river channel below the high-water mark; other areas have been at or

15 below the low water mark for decades. Accordingly, the Milburn Area has been accessible to

16 the public from the San Joaquin River for those interested in enjoying the Milburn Area's

17 extensive wildlife, environmental and recreational resources. The Project would isolate the

18 Milburn Area from the San Joaquin River, and so some of these environmental and recreational

19 resources, including in particular boating and fishing, will be lost as a result.
20 3. DWR's claimed purpose for the Project is to protect "native fish," i.e., salmon,
21 from predatory species, even though DWR ultimately acknowledged, "DWR does not have data

22 on salmon death, and the project design is not based on preventing a specific number of losses."

23 4. To make matters worse, public commenters proposed project alternatives that

24 would have achieved the objective of isolating native and invasive species while also preserving

25 boating and fishing within the Milburn Area, but DWR unlawfully dismissed such alternatives

26 as infeasible without adequate evidentiary support.

MESERVE 2
A LAW

5. This action challenges DWR's approval of the Project on the grounds that DWR

2 and its EIR violate the substantive and procedural mandates of CEQA and the CEQA

Guidelines.

4 PARTIES

5 6. Petitioner Save Public Access to the Milburn Area ("Petitioner") is an

6 unincorporated association of local residents that was formed after DWR's approval of the

7 Project in order to maintain the present action. Members of Petitioner include Tyler Lester and

8 Louis Moosios. Messrs. Lester and Moosios, along with other members of Petitioner, regularly
access the Milburn Area from the San Joaquin River and use the Milburn Area for

10 environmental and recreational purposes.

11 7. Respondent California Department of Water Resources ("DWR") is an agency of
12 the State of California located in Sacramento, California. DWR is the Project's lead agency

13 under CEQA.

14 8. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, associate,

15 governmental, co-conspirator, partner or alter-ego of those respondents and real parties in

16 interest sued herein under the 1 fictitious names of DOES 1 through 10, inclusive, are not known

17 to Petitioner, who therefore sues those respondents and real parties by such fictitious names.

18 Petitioner will ask leave of Court to amend this petition and insert the true names and capacities

19 of these respondents and real parties when the same have been ascertained. Petitioner is

20 informed and believes and, on that basis, alleges, that respondents and real parties designated

21 herein as DOEs are legally responsible in some manner for the events and happenings alleged in

22 this petition, and that Petitioner's alleged injuries were proximately caused by said respondents'

23 and real parties' conduct.

24 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

25 9. The Milburn Area includes at least two ponds. One of the Milburn Area ponds has

26 always been connected to the San Joaquin River. Another pond within the Milburn Area is a
27 former abandoned gravel mine and has been connected to the San Joaquin River for decades.

28

SOLURI
MESERVE 3
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

As such, the public has made use of this access to the Milburn Area for environmental, wildlife,

2 and recreational purposes.

3 10. The Project would isolate the Milburn Area from the San Joaquin River, thereby

4 depriving the public of longstanding boating and fishing access. The EIR acknowledges that

5 this would result in a significant and unavoidable recreational impact--an undisputed

6 environmental impact under CEQA-but DWR declined to adopt any mitigation measure or

7 project alternative to lessen this admitted impact.

8 11. Public comments proposed project alternatives that would achieve most of DWR's
asserted project objectives while also preserving boating access. DWR rejected these

10 alternatives for detailed analysis in the EIR. Instead, the EIR set forth for consideration only

11 those project alternatives that would prohibit boating access to the Milburn Area.

12 12. DWR relied on outdated and otherwise inaccurate mapping in order to

13 misrepresent the extent to which the Project would involve changes to areas located below the

14 ordinary high-water mark, and therefore fails to describe the nature and scope of potentially

15 significant impacts to Public Trust resources.

16 13. The California State Lands Commission ("CSLC") requested consultation with

17 DWR regarding the Draft EIR. A consultant of DWR purported to consult with CSLC on behalf

18 of DWR for the very limited purpose of "records of shipwrecks," but DWR did not otherwise

19 consult with CSLC regarding its broader authority as both a trustee agency and responsible
20 agency under CEQA, which includes CLCS's authority to manage Public Trust resources.

21 14. Public commenters, including experts, explained the deficiencies in the DWR's

22 range of alternatives. They explained how alternatives allowing for boating access were feasible

23 and therefore should be analyzed in the EIR. The Final EIR failed to provide good-faith

24 responses to these comments.

25 15. DWR certified its EIR and approved the Project on June 29, 2022. DWR's notice

26 of determination for the Project was published on June 30, 2022.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2 16. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to

3 Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5.

4 17. Venue is proper in Sacramento County Superior Court in accordance with Code of

5 Civil Procedure sections 395 and 401 subdivision (1).

6 18. This Petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section

7 21167, subdivision (b) and CEQA Guidelines section 15112, as well as Code of Civil Procedure

8 sections 1085 and 1094.5. DWR's notice of determination for the Project was posted for public

9 review on June 30, 2022.

10 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

11 19. Petitioner has exhausted administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

12 Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to this filing and participated in the
13 administrative process. Petitioner's members actively participated in the administrative process

14 leading up to DWR's approval of the Project, and issuance of the notices of determination, and
15 stated their objections to DWR's actions. (See Pub. Resources Code, § 21177, subd. (b).)

16 20. DWR has taken final agency actions with respect to the Project. DWR has a

17 mandatory duty to comply with all state and federal laws, including but not limited to CEQA,

18 prior to undertaking the discretionary actions at issue in this lawsuit.

19 STANDING

20 21. Petitioner has standing to assert the alleged violations of CEQA because its

21 members are beneficially interested in this matter, as required by Code of Civil Procedure
22 section 1086. Petitioner is an association that includes as its members residents who routinely

23 access and use the Milburn Area for recreational and environmental purposes. These

24 recreational and environmental interests would be directly impacted by the negative impacts of
25 the Project. Petitioner's and its members' interests have been, are being, and will continue to be

26 adversely affected by DWR's failure to comply with CEQA. Unless the relief requested herein

27 is granted, the environment will be adversely affected and injured by DWR's failure to comply

28 with CEQA in approving the Project.

SOLURI
MESERVE 5
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

22. Petitioner also has standing based on the public interest. (Save the Plastic Bag

2 Coalition v. City of Manhattan Beach (2011) 52 Cal.4th 155, 166.) DWR's duty to comply with

3 CEQA for its proposed dramatic transformation of the Milburn Area is a matter of public

4 interest.

5 23. Petitioner's members actively participated in the administrative process conducted

6 by DWR to determine the Project's environmental impacts.

7 IRREPARABLE HARM

8 24. DWR's violations of CEQA, set forth in this Petition, constitute a prejudicial

9 abuse of discretion. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21168, 21168.5.)

10 25. Petitioner possesses no other remedy to address DWR's violations of CEQA other

11 than by means of this lawsuit. If DWR's actions concerning the Project are effectuated,

12 Petitioner, its members, and the environment will be irreparably harmed. No money damages

13 could adequately compensate for that harm.

14 NOTICE OF CEQA SUIT

15 26. On July 29, 2022, Petitioner served a notice of intent to file this lawsuit, pursuant

16 to Public Resources Code section 21167.5. (See Exhibit A, Notice of Commencement of Action

17 against DWR.)

18 ELECTION TO PREPARE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD

19 27. Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2), Petitioner

20 elects to prepare the record of proceedings in this action.
21 28. Upon service of this election, Respondent must gather and transmit its
22 administrative files to Petitioner for preparation of the administrative record. Respondent is

23 required to provide its administrative files free of charge.

24 29. The scope of administrative records that Respondent must gather and provide to

25 Petitioner includes a non-exclusive list provided by Public Resources Code section 21167.6,

26 subdivision (e). Further, CEQA "contemplates that the administrative record will include pretty

27 much everything that ever came near a proposed development or to the agency's compliance

28 with CEQA in responding to that development." (County of Orange v. Superior Court (2003)

SOLURI
MESERVE 6
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

113 Cal.App.4th 1, 8.) Upon service of this election, Respondent must provide Petitioner with

2 all administrative files required for Petitioner to prepare a complete administrative record in this

3 action.

4 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

5 Violations of CEQA (Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)

6 30. Petitioner incorporates by reference each and every allegation contained in

7 Paragraphs 1 through 29, inclusive, as though fully set forth herein.

8 31. DWR prejudicially abused its discretion in certifying the Project's EIR. DWR did
not proceed in the manner required by law and their decisions in approving the project and

10 certifying the EIR are not supported by substantial evidence. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21168.5;

11 Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth v. City of Rancho Cordova (2007) 40 Cal.4th

12 412, 426.) These legal deficiencies include, without limitation, the following:

13 Inadequate Public Notification and Agency Consultation Regarding the Draft EIR

14 32. a CEQA requires a public agency to provide public notice of the availability of a
15 Draft EIR for public review and comment. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15087.) DWR failed to

16 comply with its duties to adequately inform the public and solicit comments on the Draft EIR.
17 33. DWR claimed to make the Draft EIR available to public libraries for review by the

18 public but failed to actually do so. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15087, subd. (g).)

19 34. DWR was required to specify "the manner in which the lead agency will receive
20 those comments." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15087, subd. (c)(2).) DWR failed to comply with this

21 mandate by listing an improper email address to submit public comments on the Draft EIR.

22 35. DWR failed to adequately consult CSLC in violation of Public Resources Code

23 section 21153, subdivision (a) and CEQA Guidelines section 15086, subdivisions (a)(1) and

24 (a)(2).

25 36. Public comments alerted DWR to the deficiencies, and DWR refused to recirculate

26 the Draft EIR.

27

28

SOLURI
MESERVE 7
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

Inadequate Project Description

2 37. CEQA requires that an EIR include an accurate project description, and that the

3 nature and objective of a project be fully disclosed and fairly evaluated in an EIR. (San Joaquin

4 Raptor Rescue Center v. County of Merced (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 646, 655.)

5 38. The EIR's project description is deficient because its asserted project purpose and

6 project objectives are misleading and not supported by substantial evidence.
7 Inadequate Analysis of the Project's Significant Environmental Impacts

8 39. CEQA requires that an EIR describe the proposed project's significant
environmental effects. Each must be revealed and fully analyzed in the EIR. (Pub. Resources

10 Code, § 21100, subd. (b), CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.2, subd. (a).) "[T]he adequacy of an

11 EIR's discussion of environmental impacts is an issue distinct from the extent to which the

12 agency is correct in its determination whether the impacts are significant." (Sierra Club V.

13 County of Fresno (2018) 6 Cal.5th 502, 514 [Friant Ranch]; Cleveland National Forest

14 Foundation v. San Diego Assn. of Governments (2017) 3 Cal.5th 497, 514-515; see also

15 Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay Com. V. Board of Port Comrs. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344,

16 1371.) "[W]hether a description of an environmental impact is insufficient because it lacks
17 analysis or omits the magnitude of the impact is not a substantial evidence question. A

18 conclusory discussion of an environmental impact that an EIR deems significant can be

19 determined by a court to be inadequate as an informational document without reference to
20 substantial evidence." (Friant Ranch, supra, 6 Cal.5th at 514.) To "comport with its intended

21 function" an EIR must include "detail sufficient to enable those who did not participate in its
22 preparation to understand and to consider meaningfully the issues raised by the proposed

23 project." (Ibid. [internal quotations omitted].) "Whether or not the alleged inadequacy is the

24 complete omission of a required discussion or a patently inadequate one-paragraph discussion
25 devoid of analysis, the reviewing court must decide whether the EIR serves its purpose as an

26 informational document." (Ibid.)

27 40. The EIR lacks adequate analysis and omits an adequate discussion of the

28 magnitude of the Project's impacts, and therefore failing to provide decision makers with

SOLURI
MESERVE 8
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

sufficient analysis for impacts to resource areas including, but not limited to, recreation and

2 Public Trust resources.

3 Inadequate Alternatives Analysis

4 41. The EIR fails to adequately set forth and analyze a reasonable range of

5 alternatives.

6 42. DWR unlawfully excluded from analysis in the EIR project alternatives that would

7 meet most of the Project's objectives.

8 43. DWR unlawfully rejected project alternatives based on claims of infeasibility that
are not supported by substantial evidence.

10 44. DWR unlawfully determined that alternatives were infeasible based on

11 considerations other than stated project objectives.

12 CEQA Findings are Not Supported by Substantial Evidence

13 45. DWR's CEQA Findings violate CEQA and are not supported by substantial

14 evidence. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15091, subd. (b).)

15 46. DWR's CEQA Findings improperly conclude without substantial evidence that

16 Project impacts to recreation are unavoidable.

17 47. The Findings improperly conclude without substantial evidence that the Project's

18 benefits outweigh the Project's acknowledged significant impacts to recreation.

19 Inadequate Responses to Comments

20 48. The Final EIR failed to respond in good faith to public comments raising

21 deficiencies with the Draft EIR. CEQA requires that the Final EIR include a "detailed" written

22 response to all "significant environmental issues" raised by commenters. (City of Long Beach V.

23 LAUSD (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 889, 904.) Where experts disagree about an EIR's data or

24 methodology, the Final EIR should summarize main points of disagreement and explain why

25 expert comments have been rejected. § (CEQA Guidelines, § 15151; see also Berkeley Keep Jets

26 Over the Bay Com. V. Bd. of Port Comrs. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1367, 1371.) The Final

27 EIR fails to include these critical disclosures.

28

SOLURI
MESERVE 9
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

49. The Final EIR's responses are insufficient to comply with CEQA's public
2 participation requirements. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15088, subd. (c).) The Final EIR refers to

3 master responses and cross-references specific responses that do not in fact address the

4 comments. Further, the Final EIR's responses fail to address the specific issues raised.

5 PRAYER

6 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment and relief as hereinafter set forth:

7 1. That the Court issue a peremptory a writ of mandate directing DWR to:

8 a. Vacate and set aside all approvals associated with the Project;

9 b. Comply with CEQA by preparing legally adequate environmental

10 documentation under CEQA for the Project; and
11 C. Suspend all necessary steps and all activity in furtherance of the Project
12 until DWR takes all necessary steps to bring its actions into compliance

13 with CEQA.

14 2. That the Court retain jurisdiction over this matter until Respondent complies with

15 the peremptory writ of mandate;

16 3. That the Court issue a stay, temporary restraining order, a preliminary and/or
17 permanent injunction barring DWR, and all persons working on its behalf, from proceeding with

18 any activity that may result in any physical change in the environment pending completion of

19 this litigation and full compliance with CEQA;

20 4. That Petitioner be awarded costs of this proceeding;

21 5. That Petitioner be awarded reasonable attorney's fees for this action pursuant to

22 Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable provisions of law; and

23 6. That Petitioner be awarded such other and further relief as the Court deems just
