VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Petitioner, CLEAN UP WARNER CENTER CONTAMINATION (*Petitioner"), alleges
2 through this Verified First Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate ("Petition"), as follows:

INTRODUCTION 3

4 1. Petitioner challenges the adoption by Respondent City of Los Angeles ("City" or
5 "Respondent") of environmental clearances, and the related discretionary approvals (together,
6 the "Project Approvals") for the proposed development located at 21507-21529 West Vanowen
7 Street, Canoga Park, CA (the "Project"). As noted below, the City failed to follow the required
8 procedures required by the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") when it adopted
environmental clearances for the Project, including a statutory exemption. The failure to follow
10 these procedures was prejudicial in that it precluded informed decision-making. Moreover,
11
8 implementation of the Project will have substantial adverse impacts on the environment. Channel Law Group, d77 LLZO6 2. euns "pAla BUJyS|!M E888 12 Petitioner requests that this Court vacate, set aside, rescind and void all of the
13
8 Project Approvals considered by Respondent, including rescinding any authorizations to proceed
SIl!H Áuereg 14 with demolition and construction, because the City failed to conduct the required environmental
15 review. The South Valley Area Planning Commission ("APC") for the City of Los Angeles
16 determined that the Project was eligible for a statutory exemption from CEQA on or about April
17 22, 2021. The APC also approved a Project Permit Compliance Review and Project Permit
18 Adjustment for the Project. The statutory environmental determination for the Project was
19 appealed pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 21151(c). On December 8, 2021 the Los
20 Angeles City Council denied the appeal. Petitioner requests that the Court vacate the Project
21 Approvals because Respondent failed to comply with the provisions set forth under CEQA and
22 therefore failed to proceed in a manner required by law.
23 3. Petitioner seeks a Peremptory Writ of Mandate under California Code of Civil
24 Procedure section 1094.5, directing Respondent to vacate, rescind and set aside all Project
25 Approvals and the environmental determinations because Respondent failed to comply with
26 CEQA.

3 17. On November 24, 2020, an appeal was filed by Gina K Thornburg, Executive
Director of Coalition for Valley Neighborhoods, within the required 15-day appeal period,
5 challenging the entire decision of the Director of Planning. Reasons for the appeal pertain to the

6 omission of a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment in the November 9, 2020, Director's Letter
7 of Determination, potential contamination of the Subject Property, based on its proximity to the
8 Raytheon-Canoga Avenue Facility site (the former Aerojet Rocketdyne site), which is a known

1 December 8, 2021, the Los Angeles City Council voted to deny the CEQA Appeal. An additional

Petition was timely filed to challenge the City's denial of the CEQA Appeal.
CEQA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS

5 21. In 1970, the California Legislature enacted CEQA, as a means of forcing public
6 agency decision makers, such as Respondent, to document and consider the environmental
implications of its actions. CEQA's fundamental goal is to fully inform the public and the
8 decision makers as to the environmental consequences of proposed projects and to assure
9 members of the public that their elected officials are making informed decisions. CEQA requires
10 governmental authorities, such as Respondent, to fully evaluate potential environmental effects
11
® of projects, and to seek feasible means to reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that
d77 Channel Law Group, 90211 12| otherwise could result from their actions. CEQA limits agencies from approving projects with
13
8 eINS "pAE BuIJySI!M €8€8 significant adverse impacts when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen such impacts.
'SIl!H AueAeg 14 22. CEQA is California's broadest environmental law and helps to guide public
15 agencies such as the City during issuance of permits and approval of projects. Courts have
16 interpreted CEQA to afford the fullest protection of the environment within the reasonable scope
17 of the statutes. CEQA applies to all discretionary projects proposed to be conducted or approved
18 by a City, including private projects requiring discretionary government approval. See California

19 Public Resources Code, sections 21000 - 21178, and Title 14 Cal. Code Regs., section 753, and
20 Chapter 3, sections 15000 15387.
21 23. A strong presumption in favor of requiring preparation of an Environmental
22 Impact Report ("EIR") is built into CEQA which is reflected in what is known as the "fair
23| argument" standard, under which an agency must prepare an EIR whenever substantial evidence
24 in the record supports a fair argument that a project may have significant effect on the
25 environment. No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75, 82; Friends of "B" St.
26 V. City of Haywood (1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 988, 1002.

24. "The EIR is the primary means of achieving the Legislature's considered
2 declaration that it is the policy of this state to 'take all action necessary to protect, rehabilitate,

3 and enhance the environmental quality of the state.' (Public Resources Code 21000 et seq.) The
EIR is therefore 'the heart of CEQA.' [Citations.] An EIR is an "environmental 'alarm bell'
whose purpose it is to alert the public and its responsible officials to environmental changes

21 26. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
22 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
23 27. The Project does not qualify for a Statutory Exemption under CEQA because the

Impact Report (EIR) be required; substantial changes in circumstances have taken place, namely
2 the March 19, 2021, discovery of high levels of the carcinogen PCE underlying the Project site,
3 which impelled the City to impose three new mitigation strategies onto the Project, thereby
requiring major revisions to the Warner Center 2035 Plan EIR and bringing the Project out of
compliance with the Warner Center 2035 Plan EIR (Cal. Code Regs. Tit. 14 Section
6 15162[a][1][2]); these new empirical facts became available in March 2021 and were not known 5

nor could have been known at the time the Warner Center 2035 Plan EIR was certified on
8 October 23, 2013; these new facts constitute "substantial evidence ... that the project may have a 7

10 Section 21080[d]); this "substantial evidence includes fact ... [and] expert opinion supported by 9 significant effect on the environment" requiring the preparation of a project-specific EIR (PRC

11 fact" (PRC Section 21080[e][1]). Moreover, contrary to the City's claims otherwise, exceptions ® d'11 'dnoug MET auueug 41Z06 auns "pAla eJ!ySIM €8£8 12 in CEQA Guidelines Section 15300.2 to categorical exemptions have taken place and apply to
13 the Project. During the public hearing process members of the public, including Petitioner, 8
SIl!H Beverly 14 submitted substantial evidence detailing why the Project does not qualify for a statutory
15 exemption from CEQA. On December 7, 2021 a robust response to the City's Appcal
Recommendations Report was submitted by Gina Thornburg. On or about December 6, 2021,
17 Petitioner submitted an expert report from a professional geologist in support of the CEQA 16

18 Appcal.

19 28. The Project applicant conducted a soil vapor survey, not a Phase 2 Site
20 Assessment. The soil vapor survey consisted of soil-vapor testing in six bore holes underneath
21 the subterranean parking garage at 21515 W. Vanowen on March 19, 2021. Contamination by
the volatile organic compound tetrachloroethene (PCE) was found in soil-vapor samples
23 underneath the surface of the Project Site and was attributed, by the Applicant, to the migration 22

24 of groundwater northward off of the Raytheon-Canoga Avenuc Facility site across the street.
25 However, expert analysis characterized this assertion as merely a guess; without conducting a
26 complete Phase 2 Environmental Site Assessment and chemical fingerprinting of the PCE

28

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 underlying the Project site, the actual source of the carcinogenic contamination remains
2 unknown and no risk assessment to human health has been performed.

29. The discovery, on March 19, 2021, of PCE at levels exceeding residential
screening levels established by the Department of Toxic Substances Control underlying the
Project Site constitutes "new information that was not known and could not have been known at
the time the Program EIR was certified" and meets the standard of a triggering event under PRC
7 Section 21166(a)(b)(c) to require that the Project undergo a supplemental EIR. Indeed, this
8 information was so unanticipated that the City imposed three off-menu Mitigation Measures as
part of the final Letter of Determination, dated May 25, 2021: HAZ-2A, HAZ-2B, and HAZ-2C,
10 which illustrates that the mitigation measures in the Warner Center 2035 Plan EIR were

11 inadequate, the discovery of high levels of PCE on March 19 constituted a triggering event that 8 d11 'dnoJo ME] leuueua 90211 12 oUNS "pAla EULUSIIM €8€8 required changes to the Program EIR, and that a statutory exemption was inappropriately applied
13
8 to the project. The new knowledge of high levels of PCE at the Project Site required "revisions
'SIl!H Aueneg 14 to the program EIR due to the involvement of a new significant effect or a substantial increase in
15 the severity of a previously identified effect" (Governor's Office of Planning and Research,
16 Chapter 10 CEQA, p. 274). The discovery of PCE underneath the Project Site sparked these
17 "substantial changes in the plan" by way of new Project Conditions "that were not described in
18 the program EIR" (Governor's Office of Planning and Research, Chapter 10 CEQA, p. 274).
19 These new Mitigation Measures are not within the scope of the program EIR (see Sierra Club v.
20 County of Sonoma [1992] 6 Cal.App.4th 1307) and meet the test in PRC 21166(a) as "substantial
21 changes ... proposed in the project which will require major revisions of the environmental
22 impact report." One of the tests in PRC Section 21166 is described in PRC Section 21166(b):
23 "Substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which the project is being
24 | undertaken which will require major revisions in the environmental impact report." The changed
25 circumstances regarding the Project are the discovery of high levels of PCE, the lack of an
26 investigation as to its source, and the omission of a full characterization of all contaminants of

27

10 28

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

concern on and under the Project site. The discovery of the PCE motivated the City to impose
major revisions in the Project conditions, which constitute "[a]dditional mitigation measures and
3 alternatives" that "may also be applied when a subsequent or supplemental EIR is prepared." A 2

reference is made on page 4.6-2 in the Draft Program EIR, from 2013, to volatile organic

area: 5

Where groundwater is present at shallow depths (15 to 20 ft below the ground surface compounds in groundwater within the Specific Plan
6
[bgs]) low concentrations of VOC (close to maximum contaminate [sic] levels
7 [MCL]) may be present in the following two areas:
• Chlorinated solvents (e.g., Tetrachloroethylene [Perchloroethylene] [PCE], 8 Trichloroethylene [TCE]) from the former Rocketdyne facilities south of the Los 9 Angeles River within the project area. [emphasis added]
10 That statement also appears to be a guess, with no evidence provided that low concentrations of
11 VOCs present "south of the Los Angeles River" would empirically come only from the former ® d17 'dnOJo MET |auueuO L1Z06
8 eyins "pAa eJJys !m €8e8 12 Rocketdyne facilities." And in fact, the Applicant's property (21507-21529 W. Vanowen Street)
13 was omitted from the hazards inventory created in 2010 and published in Appendix E of the
Hills, Beverly 14 Program EIR for the Specific Plan. Further justifications for the CEQA Appeal were outlined in
15 the response filed by Gina Thornburg on December 7, 2021 and the expert report submitted by
16 Petitioner on December 6, 2021.

17 30. Additionally, Respondent violated CEQA by failing to conduct a public hearing
18 for the CEQA Appeal before the City Council on December 8, 2021. The failure to take public
violation of Public Resources Code

20 Section 21151(c). This section of the Code states as follows: "(c) If a nonelected decision- 19 comment and conduct public hearing on the item is

22 declaration or mitigated negative declaration, or determines that a project is not subject to this 21 making body of a local lead agency certifies an environmental impact report, approves a negative

23 division, that certification, approval, or determination may be appealed to the agency's elected
24 decision-making body, if any." The PLUM Committee is not the "decision-making body" of the
25 City of Los Angeles. Rather, the full City Council is the decision-making body. Under CEQA,
26 the "decision-making body" is "any person or group of people within a public agency permitted
27 by law to approve or disapprove the project at issue." CEQA Guidelines, § 15356. The PLUM
11 28

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Committee does not have the authority to approve or disapprove the CEQA Appeal. The City has
2 not adopted the required objectives, criteria and specific procedures for administering its
responsibilities under CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15022(a).

31. The ultimate authority to approve the environmental clearance document for the
Project and act on the CEQA Appeal rests with the City Council. Case law also establishes that

6 the public hearing cannot be divested to a non decision-making body. In Kleist v. City of

7 Glendale (1976) 56 Cal.App.3d 770, 779, the court held the city council itself was required to

8 review and consider an EIR. The court in Kleist reasoned that "[d]elegation is inconsistent with
the purpose of the review and consideration function since it insulates the members of the
10 council from public awareness and possible reaction to the individual members' environmental

11 and economic values. Delegation is inconsistent with the purposes of the EIR itself." Kleist, 8 d77 'dnoJ5 MET jeuueuo L1Z06 12 e}INS "PALS EJJUS|UM €8E8 supra, 56 Cal. App. 3d at p. 779. Failure to conduct a public hearing for the CEQA Appeal
13 8 before the City Council insulates members of the City Council who are not on the PLUM
'SjIIH Áueneg 14 Committec from public awareness and possible reaction to individual members' environmental
15 and economic values. The entire purpose of the CEQA Appeal provision found at Public
16 Resources Code Section 21151(c) is subverted and undermined by failing to conduct a public
17| hearing for the appeal before the City Council.
18 32. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion
19 by failing to comply with the procedures outlined in the CEQA Guidelines and failing to conduct
20 the adequate environmental review for the Project. Accordingly, Respondent's environmental
21 clearance determinations must be set aside.

19 in a meaningful manner." Natural Resources Defense Council v. Fish & Game Com. (1994) 28
20 Cal.App.4th 1104, 1126, citing Mathews v. Eldridge (1976) 424 U.S. 319, 333. Moreover, as
21 stated in Natural Resources Defense Council, due process "contemplates a meaningful
22 opportunity to present evidence contrary [to an appeal] and a meaningful consideration of that
23 evidence."
24 37. The failure to provide a public hearing before the City Council amounted to a
25 deprivation of a "fair hearing." This was especially prejudicial in light of the fact that Real Party
26 In Interest submitted a five-page rebuttal expert report at 9:55 am on December 8, 2021. The
27

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

City Council hearing was set to start at 10:00 am that morning. Appellant Gina Thornburg and
2 Petitioner were deprived of the opportunity to meaningfully consider this new evidence and an
opportunity to present contrary evidence. In sum, the failure to provide a public hearing before 3

the final City Council hearing on December 8, 2021 resulted in an unfair hearing and a violation

5 of CCP Section 1094.5
