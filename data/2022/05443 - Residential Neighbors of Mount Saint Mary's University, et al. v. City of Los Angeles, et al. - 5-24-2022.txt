DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 I.

2 INTRODUCTION

3 Petitioners Residential Neighbors of Mount Saint Mary's University, Timothy Reuben,

4 and Stephanie Reuben (collectively, "Petitioners"), bring this action to challenge the unlawful
actions of Respondent City of Los Angeles ("City" or "Respondent") in certifying the

6 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the development of Alternative 5, Mount Saint Mary's
University's ("MSMU") Wellness Pavilion project (the "Project"), approving the Project, and

8 making related findings because the EIR fails to satisfy the requirements of the California
Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA").

10 The Project involves the construction of the "Wellness Pavilion" on a 3.8-acre portion of

11 MSMU's Chalon Campus, located at 1200 Chalon Road in the City of Los Angeles. Among

12 other things, the Project includes the development of a 35,500 square-foot two-story fitness

13 center, a new outdoor pool area, Chalon Campus roadway improvements, new landscaped areas,

14 and several surface parking lots, all located on MSMU's Chalon Campus. The Project also

15 introduces three new types of events which will be attended by outside guests, students, faculty,

16 and staff.

17 Petitioners are neighbors of MSMU in the Brentwood area of the Santa Monica

18 Mountains in Los Angeles County. The neighborhood, which is within a state-designated Very

19 High Fire Hazard Severity Zone, comprises of narrow and winding canyon streets, which
20 provide the sole point of access for MSMU. MSMU's operations have historically generated

21 significant traffic and public safety problems for the community. These environmental problems

22 were highlighted during the recent 2019 Getty Fire, whereby MSMU's students fled the wildfire

23 by foot and were evacuated by drivers of the surrounding residential community. The Project
24 will significantly exacerbate existing public safety and traffic problems by drawing large
25 numbers of visitors to MSMU, and this case demands proper application of the California

26 Environmental Quality Act.

27 In certifying the EIR, Respondent failed to comply with CEQA. More specifically,

28 Respondent prejudicially abused their discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 law by certifying an EIR that does not adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's significant

2 environmental impacts. Among other things, the EIR also fails to provide a CEQA-compliant

3 alternatives analysis and response to comments. As a result of these and other deficiencies, the

4 EIR fails as an informational document.

5 Because the EIR violates CEQA, the Approvals that are reliant upon it must be

6 overturned. Therefore, Petitioners respectfully request that the Court direct Respondents to set
7 aside the certification of the EIR and associated Project Approvals.

8 By this verified Petition, Petitioners further allege as follows:

9 II.

10 THE PARTIES

11 1. Petitioner Residential Neighbors of Mount Saint Mary's University is an
12 unincorporated association of individual neighbors of MSMU. Each of these neighbors reside in
13 Los Angeles County, California and in close proximity to MSMU and the Project.
14 2. Petitioners Timothy D. Reuben and Stephanie Blum Reuben are husband and wife
15 residing in Los Angeles County, California and in close proximity to MSMU and the Project.
16 3. Respondent City of Los Angeles ("City" or "Respondent") is a municipal
17 corporation and a charter city, organized and existing under the laws of the State of California,
18 with the capacity to sue and be sued. As used herein, the terms "City" or "Respondent" include,
19 but are not limited to, City employees, agents, officers, boards, commissions, departments, and
20 their members, all equally charged with complying with duties under the City Charter and with
21 the laws of the State. Respondent is the lead agency under CEQA for consideration of
22 certification of the EIR and has principal responsibility for approving the Project.
23 4. Real Party in Interest Mount Saint Mary's University ("MSMU") is listed as the
24 applicant on all documents relevant to the Project, including, but not limited to, all Applications,
25 Notices, Environmental Impact Reports, Certifications, Approvals, and Notices of
26 Determination.

27 5. Petitioners do not know the true names or capacities, whether individual,
28 corporate, associate, or otherwise, of Respondent and Real Parties in Interest Does 1 through 25,
2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

inclusive, and therefore sue said Respondents and Real Parties in Interest under fictitious names.

2 Petitioners will amend this Petition to show their true names and capacities when and if

3 Petitioners ascertain the same.

4 III.

5 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

6 6. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to

7 Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21168

8 and 21168.5. The Court has jurisdiction to issue declaratory relief pursuant to Code of Civil

9 Procedure section 1060 and injunctive relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 525 et

10 seq.

11 7. Venue is proper in this Court under Code of Civil Procedure sections 393 and

12 394(a), because Respondent City of Los Angeles is located and subject to service in Los Angeles

13 County, the Project site is located in Los Angeles County, and all of the acts or omissions alleged

14 herein occurred in Los Angeles County.

15 8. This action was timely filed. Petitioners filed this Petition and Complaint prior to
16 the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations.

17 9. Petitioners performed all conditions precedent to filing this action by complying

18 with the requirements of PRC § 21167.5 by serving § prior notice of the complaint in this action.

19 A copy of the written notice and proof of service is attached as Exhibit A to the Petition in this

20 action.

21 10. Petitioner provided notice of this action to the Attorney General of the State of

22 California by serving a copy of this Petition along with a notice of its filing, as required by PRC

23 vop 21167.7 and CCP § 388. A copy of the written notice and proof of service is attached as

24 Exhibit B to the Petition in this action.

25 11. Pursuant to CEQA § 21167.6, Petitioners concurrently file a request concerning
26 preparation of the Record of Proceedings relating to this action. A true and correct copy of such
27 notice is attached as Exhibit to the Petition in this action. Pursuant to CEQA con
28 21168.6.7(g)(8), Respondent is required to certify the Record of Proceedings to this Court within
3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 ten (10) days of service of this Petition.

2 IV.

3 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

12. Petitioners are neighbors of MSMU, and live along or adjacent to the narrow,

5 winding streets that provide the sole point of access for MSMU. Petitioners would be adversely

6 affected by impacts of the Project due to the City's actions and approval, and are aggrieved by
7 the acts, omissions, and decisions of the City as alleged in this Petition. Living in such close

8 proximity to MSMU and the Project, Petitioners have a substantial interest in ensuring that the

9 City's land use decisions are made in compliance with the City Charter, municipal code, and
10 other local land use regulations, as well as with state laws applicable to land use approvals such

11 as the California Environmental Quality Act.

12 13. Petitioners have actively participated in the administrative and environmental
13 review process prior to close of the public hearings on the Project and before the issuance of the
14 Notice of Determination. Petitioners have fully exhausted administrative remedies to the extent
15 required by law. (Pub. Res. Code § 2117(a).)

16 14. CEQA allows a petitioner who objected to a project to allege in a petition all
17 deficiencies asserted by others. (California Clean Energy Committee V. City of Woodland (2014)
18 225 Cal.App.4th 173, 191.). Petitioners and other interested groups and individuals commented

19 on the Project and raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this Petition.

20 15. Respondent has taken final agency actions certifying the EIR and adopting related
21 Project approvals and findings. Respondent had a mandatory duty to comply with all applicable
22 laws, including CEQA, prior to undertaking the discretionary approvals at issue in this Petition.
23 Petitioners possess no effective remedy to challenge the Project approvals at issue in this action
24 other than by means of this lawsuit.

25

26 1 Subsequent to serving the Notice of Intent to Sue, the Notice the Attorney General, and
27 the Request for Record of Proceeding, Petitioners made two minor revisions to the Petition by (1) removing Timothy D. Reuben as an attorney of record for Petitioners, and (2) correcting
28 Stephanie Reuben's legal name.

4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 16. Venue is proper in this Court under Code of Civil Procedure sections 393 and

2 394(a), because Respondent City of Los Angeles is located and subject to service in Los Angeles

3 County, the Project site is located in Los Angeles County, and all of the acts or omissions alleged

4 herein occurred in Los Angeles County.

5 V.

6 PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

7 17. Respondent released a Notice of Preparation in August 2016, stating MSMU's
8 request for a Plan Approval to construct the Wellness Pavilion.

9 18. Respondent released a Draft EIR for public review in April 2018. Many parties,
10|| including organizations and individual members of the public, provided written comments on the
11 Draft EIR.

12 19. In June 2021, Respondent released the Final EIR for the development of
13 Alternative 5 (the "Project"). The Final EIR included, among other things, responses to
14 comments on the Draft EIR and revisions to the Draft EIR.

15 20. On July 14, 2021, Respondent held a public hearing on the Project. However,
16 Respondent had failed to publish the Public Hearing Notice in the Daily Journal, as required by
17 the LAMC. Accordingly, Respondent held a second public a hearing on October 21, 2021.

18 21. On December 2, 2021, Respondent issued its Letter of Determination certifying
19 the Final EIR, approving the Project, and making related findings. Petitioners, as well as many
20 others, appealed Respondent's decisions pursuant to the LAMC.
21 22. On April 5, 2022, the Planning and Land Use Management (*PLUM") Committee
22 of the City held a public hearing to consider all appeals relating to the Project. At the public
23 hearing, the PLUM Committee denied all appeals, sustained the decisions of Respondent, and
24 adopted modified Conditions of Approval. Respondent issued its Final Notice of Determination

25 on April 15, 2022.

26 VI.

27 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

28 23. MSMU is a private university offering undergraduate and graduate degrees ät two
5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

campuses in Los Angeles: the Chalon Campus located in the Brentwood Community, and the

2 Doheny Campus located near downtown Los Angeles. MSMU's Chalon Campus operates as a

3 private education use in a single-family residential zone under a Deemed-to-be-Approved
Conditional Use Permit and subsequent Plan Approvals. In 2016, MSMU requested a Plan
Approval to construct and operate the "Wellness Pavilion," a 38,000 square-foot facility within a

6 3.8-acre developed portion of its Chalon Campus.

24. The Draft EIR included the original Wellness Pavilion proposed by MSMU, as

8 well as potentially feasible alternatives that could attain most of the basic objectives of the
proposed project while also reducing the significant environmental effects of the proposed
10 project. The Draft EIR identified "Alternative 5" as the Environmentally Superior Alternative

11 (the "Project"). Compared to the original proposed project, the Project, among other things,
12 eliminated the construction of a parking deck and reduced the amount of parking spaces added

13 under the Project. The Draft EIR also included MSMU's contention that MSMU had the right to

14 increase student enrollment, but MSMU's contention was removed from the Final EIR.

15 25. The Project would include a 38,000-square-foot, two-story Wellness Pavilion

16 within a 3.8-acre portion of the 45-acre Campus. The Project includes a fitness building, two
17 tennis courts, a swimming pool, two facilities management buildings, and several surface

18 parking lots. The Project components would include a gymnasium, multipurpose rooms, exercise

19 rooms, office, and support space (lockers, showers, restrooms, equipment storage, etc.). The
20 Project would also include a new outdoor pool area, landscaped open space, and continuous
21 pedestrian paths between the three tiers of the Chalon Campus.

22 26. The Project does not include a request to increase student enrollment but assumes
23 2,200 permitted students with no explanation of the increase from the previously approved 750.
24 The Project will introduce three new types of events which will be attended by outside guests,
25 students, faculty, and staff: The Summer Sports Camps (which will operate over a 12-week

26 period each year and will be attended by 400 outside guests per day, plus staff), the

27 Health/Wellness Speaker Series (eight annual events), and Other Wellness/Sports
28 Events/Activities (twelve annual events). Additionally, two existing events - Athenian Daÿ and
6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Homecoming - will take place at the new Wellness Pavilion.

2 Wildfire, Public Safety, and Evacuation Impacts

3 27. MSMU's Chalon Campus and the Project are located within a "Very High Fire

4 Hazard Severity Zone." The Project is located several narrow, windy, and traffic-burdened miles

5 away from the first-call fire station. Ever since the Draft EIR was issued in 2018, Los Angeles

6 County alone experienced eight major wildfires: the Woolsey Fire in 2018 (3 citizen fatalities),

7 the Saddleridge Fire, the Tick Fire, and the Getty Fire in 2019, during which MSMU students

8 and Brentwood residents were evacuated. During the Getty Fire, students and others fled the

9 campus into the neighborhood with no direct plan, and residents took it upon themselves to

10 shelter students and/or transport them south for pickup by friends and family.

11 28. In evaluating the hazards created by a project, CEQA Guidelines Appendix G

12 requires EIRs to analyze whether a Project will "[e]xpose people or structures, either directly or
13 indirectly, to a significant risk of loss, injury or death involving wildland fires.' CEQA

14 Guidelines Appendix G § IX(g). Petitioners and many other members and groups of the public

15 raised concerns about the Project's impacts on wildfire and safety. The Project provides for new
16 large events and summer camp programs with high enrollment numbers, and more people who

17 are not familiar with the surrounding area will inevitably be drawn into the MSMU Chalon

18 Campus. Testimony throughout the administrative process, including expert letters submitted to

19 the City, attested to MSMU's lack of control of access and evacuation during prior fires in
20 Brentwood.

21 29. However, the Final EIR does not adequately address the impact of wildfires, and
22 the Final EIR's responses to comments by Petitioners and others were inadequate and
23 conclusory. The Final EIR calls for a "shelter in place" strategy, and it supports this strategy by
24 merely stating that MSMU developed this wildfire emergency plan in consultation with the Los
25 Angeles Fire Department. The Final EIR provides no enforceable means of ensuring that

26 students would actually shelter in place. It simply assumes the policy would work. However,
27 there are no standards for sheltering in place and human behavior suggests, and past history
28 proves, that when faced with an emergency, people will flee rather than stay in place. The' 2019
7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 Getty Fire demonstrated this. Nothing assures orderly evacuation of the campus, if it became

2 necessary, and nothing even requires that events would be cancelled even if a high safety threat

3 exists.

4 30. Moreover, the Final EIR does not adopt numerous additional mitigation measures

5 suggested by the public and experts to reduce wildfire and safety risks, and provides no

6 explanation or evidence that such measures are infeasible. For example, Brentwood residents
submitted an October 1, 2021 report by The McMullen Company that provided an analysis of the

8 failure of the EIR to adequately address these issues, and that suggested mitigation measures the

9 EIR must incorporate to effectively address these issues. But neither letter of determination nor
10 the Final EIR addresses these proposed mitigation measures or explains why they are not
11 feasible. The Project's impact on wildfires is significant and unavoidable, and Respondent was
12 required to adopt all feasible mitigation measures provided by experts in the field.
13 Traffic and Transportation Impacts

14 31. The Final EIR's discussion of traffic and transportation impacts is deficient. The
15 Final EIR concludes that the Project will have a less than significant traffic and transportation
16 impact because the Project will include the mitigation measures set forth in the Mitigation
17 Monitoring Program, PDF-TRAF-12, 13, and 18 of the Final EIR. These measures purport to
18 impose certain limitations on traffic through vehicle trip caps and periodic "audits," enforced by
19 the Los Angeles Department of Transportation.

20 32. However, the mitigation measures do not include any enforcement mechanism.
21 Though the Final EIR provides for periodic audits, the Final EIR is silent on whether MSMU

22 must bring the vehicle trip counts into compliance if the audits reveal a failure to meet the

23 established performance standard. The lack of any actual enforcement mechanism renders these
24 features or measures unenforceable.

25 33. Moreover, the Final EIR fails to account for the foreseeable increase in the
26 number and frequency of events and associated vehicle trips on the MSMU Chalon Campus
27 stemming from the new events anticipated for the Wellness Pavilion. The Final EIR attempts to
28 avoid traffic impacts during peak hours of the day, but there will undoubtedly be an increäse of
8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 events during evening hours. The traffic resulting from evening events will cause or exacerbate

2 nighttime noise, and vehicle and pedestrian safety. The potential safety impacts are more

3 pronounced by the narrow, winding, and sometimes unlit neighborhood roadways that provide

4 access to MSMU Chalon Campus. The Final EIR fails to include any analysis of these safety

5 effects.

6 Foreseeable Cumulative Effects of Enrollment

7 34. MSMU opened its Chalon Campus in 1930 with 150-200 students, a stated

8 intention of maximum enrollment of 500 students, and a condition that its uses must be

9 consistent with educational subjects (in conformance with the State Educational Code).
10 However, MSMU has expanded its enrollment over the years well beyond its approved
11 enrollment cap in violation of its conditional approval.

12 35. To ensure consistency with the zone, in 1984 the City limited the school's
13 enrollment to 750 and agreed not to increase enrollment in an ad hoc fashion, limiting growth to

14 1,072 students if later requested, contingent on construction of a parking structure. Although
15 MSMU applied to build the parking structure, it did not request an additional enrollment

16 increase. In fact, the environmental documents for the parking structure indicate, "no enrollment

17 increase is allowed." Despite these clear limits, MSMU's enrollment has grown to over 1,500
18 students with future plans for 2,200 students (according to the Draft EIR).

19 36. In response to the public's comments, the Final EIR was revised to include a
20 definitive statement by MSMU of its current ultimate enrollment and to remove any request to
21 increase student enrollment. MSMU has repeatedly disclaimed any relationship of the Project to
22 student enrollment. However, the fact that the Project does not specifically propose an increase

23 in enrollment is belied by the fact that enrollment increases is an entirely foreseeable
24 consequence of the Project. By simply disclaiming any relationship of the Project to enrollment,
25 the Final EIR fails to account for foreseeable cumulative effects. Further, this failure renders the
26 proposed Project Design Features incorporated into the determinations and Mitigation
27 Monitoring and Reporting Program illusory.

28 37. Even if enrollment increases would not directly result from the Project, MSMU

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

believes it is entitled to reach its enrollment level without any further approval by the City. (See

2 Draft EIR, Project Description.) However, future increases in enrollment to eventual maximum

3 levels are foreseeable under any development scenario on the campus. This remains true

4 irrespective of the enrollment level to which MSMU believes it is entitled. Consequently, even

5 though MSMU now attempts to disclaim the enrollment limit it believes applies, the EIR's

6 analysis both of indirect effects and cumulative effects must account for foreseeable increases in

7 enrollment.

8 38. MSMU has remained coy about its enrollment figures throughout the

9 administrative process, confusing any claim or evaluation of existing or future enrollment.
10 Despite clear limits on enrollment at its Chalon Campus, MSMU has implied at various points

11 that enrollment is essentially fungible, as students travel between the Chalon and Doheny

12 campuses for various academic needs. But MSMU's approach renders any enrollment cap

13 imposed in the Chalon Campus' entitlement history meaningless, and permits MSMU to

14 circumvent any limitation on the Chalon campus by simply enrolling students at Doheny and
15 allowing them to travel freely between campuses. This approach also means that MSMU (and the

16 EIR) must attempt to quantify increased travel to the Chalon campus from the Doheny campus as

17 enrollment at Doheny grows. This is particularly true if MSMU's academic structure provides

18 that certain academic functions or opportunities are only available at the Chalon campus -- a

19 condition implied by the necessity for students to travel between campuses.

20 39. Among other things, the purpose of the cumulative impacts analysis is to avoid

21 considering projects without regard for the combined effects of that and other projects.

22 (Whitman V. Board of Supervisors (1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 397, 408.) The failure to analyze

23 potential cumulative effects constitutes a form of piecemealing or segmentation. (Golden Door
24 Properties, LLC v. County of San Diego (2020) 50 Cal.App.5th 467, 527.) An adequate analysis

25 of cumulative impacts is particularly important when another related project might significantly
26 worsen the Project's adverse environmental impacts and therefore constitutes a mandatory
27 component of any accurate cumulative impact analysis. (Friends of the Eel River v. Sonoma

28 County Water Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 859. However, the multiple claims in the Final
10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 EIR regarding the inapplicability of enrollment levels led to the complete failure to calculate,

2 evaluate, and disclose these effects. (See Draft EIR, § IV.K Traffic, p. IV.K-30, referencing only

3 external cumulative projects.) The law is clear that any adequate environmental analysis must

4 evaluate "past, present, and reasonably foreseeable" other projects: in this case, future actions

5 likely include enrollment increases consistent with levels to which MSMU claims entitlement.

6 Obviously, an enrollment increase will significantly exacerbate the dangers of wildfires,

7 evacuation, and the issues relating to traffic. The failure to include this analysis of reasonable

8 foreseeable impacts represents a prejudicial abuse of discretion, and robs the purported

9 conclusions of this analysis of substantial evidentiary support.

10 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

11 (Petition for Writ of Mandate Against Respondent City of Los Angeles)

12 40. Petitioners re-allege Paragraphs through 39, which are incorporated herein by
13 this reference.

14 41. CEQA was enacted by the Legislature to ensure that the long-term protection of
15 the environment is a guiding criterion in public decisions. (Pub. Res. Code, § 21001(d).) CEQA
16 requires the lead agency for a project with the potential to cause significant environmental

17 impacts to prepare an EIR for the project that complies with the requirements of the statute,
18 including, but not limited to, the requirement to disclose and analyze the project's potentially
19 significant environmental impacts. (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002.1(a), 21100(a), 21151(a); 14 CCR
20 §§ 15064(a)(1), (f)(1), 15367.) The EIR must provide sufficient environmental analysis such
21 that the decision makers can intelligently and fully consider environmental consequences when
22 acting on the proposed project. Such analysis must include and rely upon thresholds of
23 significance that are based on substantial evidence in the record.

24 42. CEQA also mandates that the lead agency analyze and adopt feasible and
25 enforceable mitigation measures that would reduce or avoid each of a project's significant
26 environmental impacts. (PRC § 21061.) If any of the project's significant impacts cannot be
27 mitigated to a less than significant level, then CEQA bars the lead agency from approving a
28 project if a feasible alternative is available that would meet the project's objectives while
11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 avoiding or reducing its significant environmental impacts.

2 43. Each of Respondent's findings and conclusions, including those in the Final EIR,

3 must be supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record, and the agency must

4 explain how the evidence in the record supports the conclusions the agency has reached.

5 (Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles (1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 515.)

6 44. Respondent committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in a
manner required by law because the Project relies on an EIR that fails to meet CEQA's

8 requirements for the disclosure, analysis, mitigation, reduction, and/or avoidance of significant

9 environmental impacts from the Project, including direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts
10 relating to wildfire, public safety, traffic and transportation. These deficiencies rendered the EIR

11 inadequate as an environmental document and precluded informed decision making and
12 informed public participation.

13 45. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the Project's
14 significant direct, indirect, and cumulative wildfire-related impacts.

15 46. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the Project's
16 significant direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts on traffic and transportation.

17 47. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the Project's
18 significant direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts on student enrollment.

19 48. The responses to comments in the Final EIR fail to meet CEQA's requirements in
20 that they neither adequately dispose of all the issues raised, nor provide specific rationale for
21 rejecting suggested Project changes, including the consideration or adoption of feasible
22 mitigation measures or alternatives. CEQA requires a that a lead agency evaluate and respond to
23 all environmental comments on the Draft EIR that it receives during the public review period.
24 The responses must describe the disposition of the issues raised and must specifically explain
25 reasons for rejecting suggestions and for proceeding without incorporating the suggestions. The
26 Final EIR's responses to comments fail to satisfy the requirements of law. Failing to adequately
27 respond to comments rendered the Final EIR inadequate as an informational document.
28 49. Based upon each of the foregoing reasons, the EIR is legally defective under
12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

-

2 CEQA. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion in violation of CEQA in approving the

3 Project. As such, the Court should issue a writ of mandate directing Respondents to set aside the
certification of the EIR and approval of the Project.
