NOTICE TO ATTORNEY GENERAL

1 TO THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL:

2 Pursuant to Pub. Res. Code $ 21167.7, Petitioners Marlene Perez, Maria Guadalupe Ortiz,

3 and UNITE HERE Local 11 (collectively "Petitioners") hereby give notice of its Verified Petition

4 for Writ of Mandate filed September 22, 2022 ("Petition"), attached hereto as Exhibit A, which

5 includes claims made under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA").

6 The Petition challenges the actions of the Respondent City of Garden Grove, City of

7 Garden Grove as Successor Agency to the Agency for Community Development and the Garden

8 Grove Housing Authority (collectively "City") in approving the B2 Site 500-room, 23-story hotel

9 with the 600-seat Nick Studio theater (*Project") at the 3.72-acre site located in the City at the

10 northwest corner of Harbor Boulevard and Twintree Avenue. The Petition alleges (among other

11 things) that the City abused its discretion by approving the various Project approvals, including

12 but not limited to the Project's Mitigated Negative Declaration (SCH No. 2022060174)

13 ("MND"). The City adopted the MND instead of an environmental impact report despite

14 substantial evidence (including several environmental experts) indicating the Project's significant

15 impacts on vehicle miles traveled, air quality, land use, and greenhouse gas emissions ("GHG").

16 So too, the City failed to recirculate the MND after substantively changing its GHG threshold,

17 which was made known by a handout provided to the public right before the City Council hearing

18 where it adopted the MND on August 23, 2022. The following day (August 24), the City

19 prematurely filed a notice of determination before the Project's final approval on September 13.

20 Petitioners urge the Attorney General to review the Petition. Here, the City's actions result

21 in greater environmental impacts and sets a dangerous precedent for improper procedures that

22 circumvent CEQA's informed decision-making. Petitioners seek to have the Project's MND, land

23 use entitlements, and Development Agreement disposing of public land, and other approvals set

24 aside, along with such other relief as the Court deems proper. Respectfully submitted,

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE, COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. By this action, Petitioners Marlene Perez, Maria Guadalupe Ortiz, and UNITE

3 HERE Local 11 ("Local 11") (collectively "Petitioners") challenge the unlawful actions of the

4 City of Garden Grove, City of Garden Grove as Successor Agency to the Agency for Community

5 Development and the Garden Grove Housing Authority, (collectively "City" or "Respondents")

6 in approving the B2 Site 500-room, 23-story hotel with the 600-seat Nick Studio theater

7 ("Project") at the 3.72-acre site at the northwest corner of Harbor Boulevard and Twintree

8 Avenue including 11261, 12241, 12271, 12291, 12311 and 12323 Harbor Boulevard and 12246,

9 12252, 12262, 2282, 12292, 12312, 12322, 12251, 12261, 12281, 12291, 12311 and 12321

10 Thackery Drive ("Site") in the City.

11 2. Specifically, on September 13, 2022, the City approved the following actions

12 challenged herein for the Project: Planned Unit Development No. PUD-141-01(A) ("PUD"), Site

13 Plan Review No. SP-107-2022 ("SPR"), and Street Vacation No. SV-002-2022 ("Street

14 Vacation"') (collectively "Entitlements"); Mitigated Negative Declaration (SCH No. 2022060174)

15 ("MND") under the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Res. Code § 21000 et seq.)

16 ("CEQA") and "CEQA Guidelines" (14 Cal. Code. Regs. § 15000 et seq.); disposition or sale of

17 City-owned land 12291 and 12311 Thackery Drive; and a Disposition and Development

18 Agreement ("DDA") for sale and development of 3.72 acres of City land (collectively

19 "Approvals") to Real Parties in Interest applicant Newage Garden Grove II, LLC and Kam Sang

20 Company ("Real Parties").

21 3. Petitioners allege that the City abused its discretion by approving the Entitlements,

22 the MND, and the Approvals, including but not limited to the sale or disposition of City-owned

23 land and the DDA. As set forth in the First Cause of Action, the City, throughout the approval

24 process, failed to support its CEQA analysis and land-use findings for all the Project Approvals

25 with substantial evidence. Because a MND was used for the Project's environmental review,

26 instead of a more comprehensive environmental impact report ("EIR"), the Project is subject to

27 the less deferential "fair argument" standard, which requires lead agency to prepare an EIR

28
-2-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE, COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 whenever substantial evidence in the record supports a fair argument that project may have a

2 significant effect on the environment. (See Pub. Res. Code §§ 21100, 21151; Laurel Heights

3 Improvement Ass'n V. Regents of the Univ. of Cal. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 1112, 1123.) This is a very

4 large Project not appropriate for a MND. There is a "fair argument" here of the Project's

5 significant impacts to transportation, vehicle miles traveled (*VMT"), air quality, land use, and

6 greenhouse gas emissions ("GHG") thus, an EIR must be prepared. Moreover, as set forth in the

7 Second Cause of Action, the Entitlements findings do not adequately characterize and address

8 inconsistencies with the City's General Plan and other applicable provisions of the Garden Grove

9 Municipal Code ("Code" or "GGMC"). By rezoning the property from R-1 to PUD, the City

10 violates various City General Plan goals, objectives, and policies, such as utilizing City land for

11 much-needed housing. All these flaws invalidate Code-required findings necessary to grant the

12 Entitlements. Finally, because the Project involved the disposition of City-owned land previously

13 owned by the City Redevelopment Agency, the Third Cause of Action alleges a procedural claim

14 for "reverse validation" - an in rem proceeding under Code. Civ. Proc. §§ 860 and 863. Under the

15 validation statutes, all persons interested in those sales contracts are also parties to this case as

16 identified in the case caption.

17 JURISDICTION

18 4. This Court has jurisdiction under Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168 or 21168.5 (CEQA

19 actions), Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1085 or 1094.5 (mandamus actions), or Code Civ. Proc. § 860 et seq. §

20 ("Validation" actions). The Project Site is located in the County of Orange. The within action has

21 been timely brought within 90 days of the City granting the Project Approvals pursuant to Gov.

22 Code § 65009. Under Pub. Res. Code § 21167, the within action has been timely brought within

23 30 days of the (premature as discussed below) August 24, 2022 posting of a CEQA Notice of

24 Determination ("NOD") for the Project. Per Pub. Res. Code § 21167.5, Petitioners served a

25 Notice of Intent to File this Petition on the Clerk of the City by mail on September 21, 2022 as

26 reflected in Exhibit A hereto. Concurrent with the filing of this action, Petitioners notified the

27

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE, COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 Attorney General of the State of California of the filing of the action in accordance with Pub. Res.

2 Code § 21167.7.

3 PARTIES

4 5. Petitioners Marlene Perez and Maria Guadalupe Ortiz are resident of City, having

5 a beneficial interest and are impacted by the matters set forth in this Petition. Their interests will

6 be directly affected by the Project and the City's failure to comply with the requirements of

7 CEQA and governing laws in connection with the Project. Petitioners Perez and Ortiz live nearby

8 and frequent the vicinity of the Site and will be affected by the Project's negative environmental

9 impacts including but not limited to traffic, air quality, and inconsistency with applicable land use

10 plans. Petitioners participated in the Project Approvals process by submission of written and oral

11 comments.

12 6. Petitioner Unite Here Local 11 is a non-profit labor organization representing more

13 than 25,000 workers employed in hotels, restaurants, airports, sports arenas, and convention

14 centers throughout Southern California and Phoenix, Arizona. Its members, including hundreds

15 who live or work in the City, join together to fight for improved living standards and working

16 conditions. Local 11's members reside near and frequently visit the vicinity of the Site and will

17 suffer from Project impacts, particularly related to inadequate housing and environmental

18 impacts, which are core issues to the members of Local 11 and, therefore, core areas of concern

19 for the Union. Hence, Local 11 has both public interest standing and associational standing to

20 bring this Action. Petitioner participated throughout the Project Approvals process with

21 submission of comment letters and testifying before City. Petitioners, individually and through

22 their members, objected to the Project Approvals before the close of the Project's public hearing.

23 Petitioners have exhausted all administrative remedies, the City's determinations are final, and no

24 further administrative appeals are available under State or local law. All issues submitted for

25 judicial review in this Petition were sufficiently raised and disputed with Respondents before the

26 Project was approved. Respondents were given notice and the opportunity to act in compliance

27 with CEQA and other applicable law but failed to do so. It is well-established that any party who

28
-4.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE, COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 participates in the administrative process can assert all factual and legal issues raised by any

2 commenting party, official, or agency. (See Citizens for Open Government v. City of Lodi (2006)

3 144 Cal.App.4th 865, 875.) Hence, this Petition incorporates in its entirety all factual and legal

4 claims presented to the City during the Project Approvals process, whether by Petitioners, their

5 agents, representative, or by a fellow commenting party participating in the Project Approvals

6 process.

7 7. Respondent City is a local governmental general law municipal corporation in

8 Orange County, California. Its City Council acts as its Housing Authority and Successor Agency

9 to the Agency for Community Development. The City approved all the Entitlements and Project

10 Approvals.

11 8. Real Party in Interest NEWAGE GARDEN GROVE II, LLC is California

12 limited liability company doing business under the laws of the State of California with its

13 principal place of business in Arcadia, California, which is believed to be a recipient of the

14 Project Approvals.

15 9. Real Party in Interest KAM SANG COMPANY, INC. is a California corporation a

16 doing business under the laws of the State of California with its principal place of business in

17 Arcadia, California, which is believed to be the recipient of a Project Approvals.

18 10. The true names, capacities, corporate, associate or otherwise of Respondents and

19 Real Parties named herein as DOES through 10, inclusive, are unknown to Petitioners who,

20 therefore, sue said Respondents and Real Parties by fictitious names. Petitioners will amend this

21 Petition to show the true names and capacities when they have been ascertained.

22 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

23 11. This action, in part, is an in rem proceeding under Code. Civ. Proc. §§ 860 and 863

24 Validation statutes to invalidate certain contracts relating to the Project Approvals, including the

25 Entitlements, MND, DDA, and all Project Approvals approved and/or authorized by the City on

26 September 13, 2022. In accordance with the Validation statutes, all persons interested in those

27 contracts are also parties to this case.

28
-5.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE, COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 12. On July 7, 2022, the City Planning Commission conditionally approved the

2 Project's PUD, SPR and Street Vacation No. SV-002-2022 relying on the MND. Petitioners

3 submitted comments raising significant environmental impacts to air quality, land use,

4 VMT/transportation and GHG emissions necessitating an EIR instead of a MND, questioning the

5 required Code findings and noting inconsistency with General Plan requirements because of the

6 rezoning the Project Site from R-1 to PUD thereby removing the ability for the Site to be used for

7 high-density residential.

8 13. On July 27, 2022, in accordance with the GGMC, Petitioners Lopez and Local 11

9 appealed the Planning Commission's conditional approval of the Entitlements ("Appeal") to the

10 City Council on grounds of noncompliance with CEQA and required Code land use findings.

11 14. On or around August 17, 2022, without any notice to Petitioners, the City

12 uploaded onto the City's website a Final MND that included an errata and response to comments

13 ("Final MND"). That Final MND was referenced for the first time in the City Council staff report

14 that was released on Friday, August 19, 2022, for the City Council's Entitlements and Appeal

15 hearing scheduled for Tuesday, August 23, 2022thereby giving the public two business days to

16 review the Final MND. Additionally, the staff report (released August 19, 2022) stated the Appeal

17 was not ripe because none of the Entitlements or MND were final because they were merely

18 conditional recommendations that were not final until Council took final action to approve the

19 PUD.

20 15. In response, Appellants provided comments on August 23, 2022, including two

21 expert letters highlighting the inadequacies of the Entitlements and Final MND. The comments

22 raised concerns about significant environmental impacts to air quality, land use, VMT,

23 transportation, and GHG emissions necessitating an EIR instead of a MND. The comments also

24 questioned the Entitlements' land use findings for compliance with the Code, the City General

25 Plan, the Surplus Land Act, and the "No Net Loss Law" for housing (Cal. Gov. Code § 65863).

26 16. On August 23, 2022, just before the start of the City Council Appeal hearing,

27 Petitioners were provided a 14-page hardcopy of a new, updated Final MND that was dated that

28
-6-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE, COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 same day (August 23, 2022) (*Updated Final MND"), giving the public and Petitioners

2 effectively no time to review it. Despite Petitioners' objections, the City gave Petitioners merely

3 three minutes during the meeting to respond to the Final MND and Updated Final MND.

4 17. At the conclusion of the August 23, 2022 Council meeting (after minimal

5 discussion) the City denied the Appeal, contingently approved the MND and Entitlements, and

6 introduced and conducted the first reading of the PUD Ordinance noting that under the Code a

7 second reading was required for the Project to be approved.

8 18. On August 24, 2022, a premature CEQA Notice of Determination was filed with

9 the Orange County Clerk - even though the Project and its Entitlements had yet to be finally

10 approved because the PUD was not yet final.

11 19. On September 9, 2022, the City released a staff report concerning the second

12 reading of the Project's PUD and- for the first time-new documents about the Project's DA and

13 the City land proposed for sale/disposition to the Project applicants-all of which were scheduled

14 for the Council's decision on September 13, 2022.

15 20. On September 13, 2022, Petitioners submitted another comment letter with

16 additional expert evidence. The letter stated that there is a fair argument of significant impacts

17 requiring preparation of an EIR. The comments also again questioned whether the sale of the City

18 parcels complied with the requirements of the Code, the Surplus Land Act, and Gov. Code cop

19 65863.

20 21. On September 13, 2022, the Council finally approved the Entitlements, MND and

21 Project Approvals including the land sales.

22 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

23 (Writ of Administrative Mandamus - Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.5 - CEQA Violations)

24 22. Petitioners restate and reallege Paragraphs 1-21 as if fully set forth herein.

25 23. Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.5, Petitioners seek a writ of mandate to a

26 overturn the Project Approvals for CEQA violations including the MND's failure to adequately

27

28
-7-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE, COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 analyze and/or mitigate impacts related to VMT/transportation, air quality, land use inconsistency

2 and GHG emissions.

3 24. A project "may" have a significant effect on the environment if there is a

4 "reasonable probability" that it will result in a significant impact. This is a "low threshold"

5 requiring the preparation of an EIR and preference for resolving doubts in favor of environmental

6 review, even if the overall effect of the project is beneficial. (Mejia v. City of Los Angeles (2005)

7 130 Cal.App.4th 322, 332; CEQA Guidelines § 15063(b)(1).) "[T]he existence of contrary

8 evidence does not excuse a lead agency from its duty to prepare an EIR."(Pocket Protectors v.

9 City of Sacramento (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 903, 931; see also Friends of "B" Street V. City of

10 Hayward (1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 988, 1002; Sierra Club v. County of Sonoma (1992) 6

11 Cal.App.4th 1307, 1318 ['decision not to require an EIR can be upheld only when there is no

12 credible evidence to the contrary."].)

13 25. Premature NOD: Here, the SPR and Street Vacation were contingent on the

14 approval of the PUD. The City's own Appeal correspondence confirms this. The PUD was not

15 final until the second reading on September 13, 2022. Hence, no Entitlements were final and,

16 thus, the CEQA review was not final until September 13, 2022. The August 24, 2022 NOD was

17 prematurely filed in advance of the actual Project Approvals (i.e., second reading of PUD). (See

18 e.g., Coalition for Clean Air v. City of Visalia (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 408, 418, 425 [a

19 prematurely filed notice of CEQA exemption is "invalid"]; County of Amador v. El Dorado

20 County Water Agency (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 963, fn. 16 [holding notice of CEQA

21 exemption cannot be filed until after the project is approved, a "contrary conclusion would be

22 tantamount to requiring opponents to bring challenges before a project is finally approved, lest

23 they be barred by the statute of limitations. It would also thwart attempts to resolve disputes over

24 a project.' ']; San Franciscans for Reasonable Growth v. San Francisco (1984) 151 Cal.App.3d

25 61, 70 n9 [discussed in NOD context].). This premature NOD was prejudicial, and sought to

26 prematurely close the administrative record for the CEQA compliance and Updated Final MND

27 which as a matter of law remained open until the final September 13, 2022 Project Approvals.

28
-8-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE, COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 26. Procedural Violation of CEQA Requiring Recirculation: CEQA requires a lead

2 agency to recirculate a CEQA review when significant new information is added after the public

3 review but before the adoption of the CEQA document. (See Pub. Res. Code § 21092.1.) New

4 information is significant if the review is changed in a way that deprives the public of a

5 meaningful opportunity to comment. (See CEQA Guidelines § 15088.5.) Here, significant

6 changes were made. Just hours before City Council's August 23, 2022 hearing to consider the

7 Appeal and MND, the Updated Final MND was released with a brand-new qualitative threshold

8 analysis for GHG emissions prepared that same day. Appellants and public had essentially no

9 time to review the new CEQA threshold for GHGs in the Updated Final MND - even though the

10 GHG threshold issue was a central point of the Appeal and CEQA compliance. The City cannot

11 abandon a quantitative CEQA threshold for GHG emissions at the last minute the night of the

12 Project Approvals hearing and rely on an entirely new qualitative GHG threshold released that

13 night without recirculating the document for public review. This tactic violates CEQA whereby

14 lead agencies could rely on flawed CEQA thresholds, and after being thoroughly discredited on

15 Appeal, switch the thresholds out for different thresholds on the very eve of the CEQA

16 document's approval-thus avoiding any meaningful public review and comment on a new

17 different CEQA threshold (such as the case here). This circumvents one of CEQA's main goals of

18 informing decision makers and the public. (See CEQA Guidelines 15002(a)(1); see also

19 Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564.)

20 27. "Fair Argument" VMT/Transportation Impacts: A fair argument of

21 unmitigated VMT/transportation impacts exists. Expert evidence demonstrates, among other

22 things:

23 The Project appears overparked by as much as 18.4 percent, which is evidence that the

24 Project is not exempt from a more comprehensive VMT analysis than the one performed

25 in the MND, Final MND, and Updated Final MND.

26 The new Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy ("RTP/SCS")

27 consistency analysis is inadequate given the claimed VMT reduction strategies do not

28
-9.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE, COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY RELIEF

- mitigate the Project's chief VMT-inducing activities (namely the hotel/theater patrons)

2 and also fails to utilize the Site in the most efficient means from a VMT perspective (i.e.,
mt 4n'o including consideration of multi-family residential use for some component of the

Project).

The new RTP/SCS analysis in the MND fails to consider numerous project-level
mitigation measures discussed in the RTP/SCS Program EIR.

7 Nor does the new RTP/SCS analysis in the MND account for the workforce housing

8 problem, which indicates adding more jobs in the area will generate an average commute

9 distance of 30.2 VMTs per employee round tripwhich exceeds the City's 22.56 VMT

10 per service population and the County's 29.01 average VMT per service population

11 metrics that are based on the City's analysis using the Orange County Transportation

12 Model ("OCTAM") described in its General Plan Update.

13 is Nor is the proposed mitigation measure GHG-7 likely to reduce VMTs significantly, and

14 it fails to adequately implement an enforceable trip reduction program.

15 Because there is a fair argument that the Project will generate significant VMTs,

16 additional mitigation measures should be considered, like those suggested in the new

17 guidance provided by California Air Pollution Control Officers Association

18 ("CAPCOA"), such as incorporating the following:

19 - Measure T-5 Implement Commute Trip Reduction Program (Voluntary) - up to 4.0%

20 of employee VMT;

21 Measure T-7 Implement Commute Trip Reduction Program (Mandatory

22 Implementation and Monitoring - up to 26.0% of employee VMT;

23 Measure T-8 Provide Ridesharing Program (employer subsidized) - up to 8.0% of

24 employee VMT;

25 Measure T-9 Implement Subsidized or Discounted Transit Program up to 5.5% of

26 employee VMT;

27 Measure T-12 Price Workplace Parking - up to 20.0% of employee VMT; and

28
-10-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE, COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY RELIEF

- Measure T-13 Implement Employee Parking Cash Out - up to 12% of employee

2 VMT.

3 28. "Fair Argument" of Air Quality Impacts: A fair argument of unmitigated air

4 quality impacts exists. Expert evidence includes demonstrates, among other things, that:
n Construction oxides of nitrogen (*NOx"), particulate matter PM2.5, and PM10 emissions

6 are likely to be significant and unmitigated.

7 The MND and Updated Final MND's mitigation measures to lessen air quality impacts

8 associated with construction are unenforceable.

9 The MND, Updated MND, and Updated Final MND fail to require additional, feasible

10 mitigation for what are likely to be significant construction PM10 and PM2.5 impacts.

11 Air quality health impacts from construction activities were not analyzed in the MND and

12 Updated Final MND and are likely significant.

13 Acute health impacts of diesel particulate matter during Project construction and operation

14 were not evaluated in the MND and Updated Final MND and are likely significant.

15 The MND and Updated Final MND rely on faulty parameters to model air emissions and

16 conclude that they are not significant. Expert revised modeling shows potentially

17 significant volatile organic compounds ("VOC(s)") emissions exceeding thresholds.

18 29. "Fair Argument" of Land Use Impacts: The MND, Final MND, and Updated

19 Final MND failure to accurately characterize and address a fair argument of land use

20 inconsistencies with the City's General Plan and other applicable land use laws. (See e.g., CEQA

21 Guidelines § 15125(d); Pfeiffer v. City of Sunnyvale City Council (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1552,

22 1566; Friends of the Eel River, 108 Cal.App.4th at 881.) There is no discussion in any of the

23 MND documents whether the Project complies with various required housing rules, including

24 whether the rezoning of the Project Site harms the City's ability to meet its Regional Housing

25 Needs Assessment ("RHNA") or complies with the "No Net Loss Law" in Gov. Code § 65863

26 that requires adequate housing sites be maintained through the planning period. Here, by rezoning

27 the property from R-1 to PUD, the City is removing the ability for the Site to be used for

28
-11-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE, COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 residential purposes. This rezoning may create a shortfall requiring corrective rezoning elsewhere

2 in the City. The abovementioned issues violate various City General Plan goals, objectives, and

3 policies, such as utilizing General Plan-designated International West Mixed Use (*TW")

4 designated properties such as the Project Site for "some higher density residential that are

5 appropriate for a major entertainment and tourism destinations." (See General Plan, pp. 2-24 - 2-

6 25 [such as policies LU-1.5, LU-IMP-1C, and LU-2.1].) Similarly, there is no discussion how this

7 Project is consistent with the City's Housing Element, which calls for over 19,000 units needed

8 and the City to play "a key role in promoting sites for future development." (See City Housing

9 Element, pp. 12-31, 12-116 [goal H-3 and associated policies]; p. 12-124 [Program 8].) Here, the

10 City permits no housing component for this Sitewhich is inconsistent with its General Plan

11 designation (i.e., IW) and does nothing for the City's RHNA obligations. Additionally, the

12 Project may in fact exacerbate housing shortage issues by creating more service jobs without the

13 commensurate workforce housing needed (as mentioned by VMT experts). These land use

14 inconsistencies are not properly disclosed in the MND, Final MND, or Updated Final MND.

15 30. "Fair Argument" of GHG Impacts: A fair argument of unmitigated GHG

16 impacts exists. Expert evidence demonstrates, among other things:

17 The MND, Final MND, and Updated Final MND utilize unsubstantiated input parameters

18 to estimate GHG emissions.

19 The MND documents 4 fail to correctly apply Tier 4 final mitigation as indicated by the

20 South Coast Air Quality Management District ("SCAQMD").

21 The MND documents' qualitative analysis utilizes a flawed business-as-usual ("BAU")

22 methodology that is outdated, inconsistent with SCAQMD guidance, and even contrary to

23 the City's past practices.

24 The Project exceeds applicable SCAQMD Tier 4 thresholds showing impacts are

25 significant and requiring additional mitigation.

26 The Project is inconsistent with qualitative and quantitative measures under California Air

27 Resources Board ("CARB")'s Scoping Plan.

28
-12-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE, COMPLAINT FOR INVALIDATION, INJUNCTIVE, DECLARATORY RELIEF

- The new RTP/SCS consistency analysis in the Final Updated MND is inadequate for

2 numerous reasons, including being inconsistent with various qualitative and quantitative

3 measures under the RTP/SCS. Moreover, even if the Project is consistent with the

4 RTP/SCS, which it is not, that alone is not enough to meet the State's longer-term goals
un (i.e., 2030 and 2050 GHG reduction goals).
6 Because the Project appears to have a significant GHG impacts, from a quantitative and

7 qualitative perspective, additional mitigation measures are warranted, such as those

8 proposed in the RTP/SCS.

9 31. The Project fails to incorporate and impose all feasible, performance-based

10 mitigation measures that have likelihood of being implemented and enforced. (See City of

11 Maywood v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist. (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 362, 407 [CEQA requires

12 lead agencies to "craft mitigation measures that would satisfy enforceable performance criteria"].)

13 32. The Project fails to support findings and determinations with substantial evidence.

14 (See e.g., CEQA Guidelines § 15088(c); Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay Comm. v. Board of

15 Port Comm'rs (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1367, 1371 [EIR legally inadequate where the agency

16 provides conclusory statements in response to experts and other agencies critique over data and

17 methodology used to assess impacts]; People v. County of Kern (1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 761, 772 [a

18 response that "all available data" indicates sufficient groundwater supplies held insufficient where

19 the agency fails to identify said data].)

20 33. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law other than the relief

21 sought in this Petition. If the City persists in its refusal to rescind the Project Approvals, and if

22 City and Real Parties are not enjoined or stayed from undertaking acts in furtherance of the

23 Project, Petitioners and the public will suffer irreparable harm from which there is no adequate

24 remedy at law in that the Project will be built in violation of CEQA, operations commence and

25 significant adverse impacts on the environment would occur, contrary to State and local law.

4 34. Petitioners restate and reallege Paragraphs 1-33 as if fully set forth herein.

5 35.

6 Actions involving quasi-judicial zoning approvals, such as the case here, are

7 subject to an abuse of discretion standard, which is established when the local agency: (a) has not

8 proceeded in the manner required by law; (b) the decision is not supported by findings; and/or (c)

9 the evidence does not support the findings. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.5.)

36.

10 While planning agencies enjoy some discretion interpreting their zoning laws,

11 "deference has limits" and courts are not bound by unreasonable interpretations contrary to the

12 plain language of regulations and statutes. (Orange Citizens for Parks & Recreation v. Superior

13 Court (2016) 2 Cal.5th 141, 146, 156-157 [rejecting attempts to "downplay the facial

14 inconsistency," Court held city abused its discretion finding residential project consistent with

15 general plan designation where "no reasonable person could conclude that the Property could be

16 a developed without a general plan amendment"]; see also Stolman V. City of Los Angeles (2003)

17 114 Cal.App.4th 916, 928-930 [vacating variance based on zoning administrator's interpretation
contradicted by the plain language of the municipal code].)

18 37.

19 Here, the City failed to support Code required findings for the Entitlements with

20 substantial evidence. (See Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles

21 (1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 515 [this inquiry may not be perfunctory or mechanically superficial, but
requires the agency to "set forth findings to bridge the analytic gap between the raw evidence and

22

23 ultimate decision or order"]; see also West Chandler Boulevard Neighborhood Assn. V. City of

24 Los Angeles (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 1506, 1522 [city abused its discretion when it "acted on

25 evidence not in the record" where the "conclusory findings did not show how the city council

26 traveled from evidence to action"].) In particular, the PUD and SPR findings do not characterize

27 and address inconsistencies with the City's General Plan and other applicable provisions of the

28 Code. There is no discussion whether the Project harms the City's ability to meet its RHNA

-14-

1 housing obligations or complies with the "No Net Loss Law" in Gov. Code § 65863 that requires

2 adequate housing sites be maintained through the planning period. By rezoning the property from

3 R-1 to PUD, the City violates various City General Plan goals, objectives, and policies, such as

4 utilizing General Plan-designated IW designated properties such as the Project Site for "some

5 higher density residential that are appropriate for major entertainment and tourism destinations."

6 (See City General Plan, pp. 2-24 - 2-25 [e.g., policies LU-1.5, LU-IMP-1C, and LU-2.1].)

7 Similarly, there is no discussion how this Project is consistent with the City's Housing Element,

8 which calls for over 19,000 units needed and the City to play "a key role in promoting sites for

9 future development." (See City Housing Element, pp. 12-31, 12-116 [see also Goal H-3 and

10 associated policies], p. 12-124 [Program 8].) Here, the City IS not considering any housing

11 component for this Site-which is inconsistent with its General Plan designation (i.e., IW) and

12 does nothing for the City's RHNA obligations. All these issues cut against Code-required

13 findings necessary to grant the SPR and PUD. (See e.g., GGMC § § 9.32.030-D.3.b &

14 9.12.030.02-F.)

15 38. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law other than the relief

16 sought in this Petition. If the City persists in its refusal to rescind the Project Approvals, and if

17 City and Real Party are not enjoined or stayed from undertaking acts in furtherance of the Project,

18 Petitioners and the public will suffer irreparable harm from which there is no adequate remedy at

19 law in that the Project will be built in violation of the GGMC, operations commence and

20 significant adverse impacts on the environment would occur, contrary to governing law.

2 for the reasons set forth in this Petition/Complaint.

3 41. As required by Code Civ. Proc. § 860, this action has been filed within 60 days

12 absent Respondents' full compliance with legal requirements under State and local laws.

13 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

14 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for the following relief:

15 1. That the Court enters a peremptory writ of mandate ordering the City to set aside

16 and void the Project Approvals, pending the City's full compliance with the GGMC, State law,

22 pending.

23 3. That the Court issue a permanent injunction ordering the City and Real Parties to

24 refrain from proceeding with the Project pending the City's full compliance with the GGMC,

25 State law, and all other applicable land use laws and regulations, and CEQA, including

Dear Hon. Mayor and City Councilmembers:

On behalf of Petitioners Garden Grove residents Marlene Perez and Maria Guadalupe Ortiz,
and UNITE HERE Local 11 ("Local 11") ("Petitioners"), this letter is provided to the CITY OF GARDEN GROVE; CITY OF GARDEN GROVE AS SUCCESSOR AGENCY TO THE AGENCY FOR
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT and GARDEN GROVE HOUSING AUTHORITY ("City") in accordance
with Pub. Res. Code § 21167.5.

Please take notice that pursuant to Pub. Res. Code § 21167, Petitioners will file a Petition for
Writ of Mandate ("Petition") challenging the City's approval referenced above of the B2 Site 500- room, 23-story hotel with the 600-seat Nick Studio theater ("Project") at the 3.72-acre site at the northwest corner of Harbor Boulevard and Twintree Avenue including 11261, 12241, 12271, 12291, 12311 and 12323 Harbor Boulevard and 12246, 12252, 12262, 2282, 12292, 12312, 12322,
12251, 12261, 12281, 12291, 12311 and 12321 Thackery Drive ("Site") in the City.

Specifically, on September 13, 2022, the City finally approved the following actions challenged herein for the Project including but not limited to: Planned Unit Development No. PUD- 141-01(A), Site Plan Review No. SP-107-2022, and Street Vacation No. SV-002-2022 (collectively
"Entitlements"); Mitigated Negative Declaration (SCH No. 2022060174) ("MND") under the
California Environmental Quality Act Pub. Res. Code § 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"); disposition or sale of
City-owned land 12291 and 12311 Thackery Drive; and a Disposition and Development Agreement
("DDA") for sale and development of 3.72 acres of City land (collectively "Approvals") to Real
Parties in Interest applicant Newage Garden Grove II, LLC and Kam Sang Company ("Real Parties").

RE: B2 Hotel Project & Disposition of Public Land
September 21, 2022
Page 2 of 2

Petitioners will allege that the City abused its discretion by approving all the Entitlements, the MND, and all the Project Approvals including but not limited to the sale or disposition of City- owned land and the DDA.

In particular, the City throughout the approval process failed to support its CEQA analysis and land-use findings for the Project Approvals as required by law. Because a MND was used for the Project's environmental review, instead of a more comprehensive environmental impact report ("EIR"), the Project is subject to the less deferential "fair argument" standard, which requires a lead
agency to prepare an EIR whenever substantial evidence in the record supports a fair argument that a project may have a significant effect on the environment. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21100, 21151; Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 1112, 1123. This is a very large Project not appropriate for a MND. There is a "fair argument" here of the Project's
significant impacts to transportation and vehicle miles traveled ("VMT"), air quality, land use and greenhouse gas emissions ("GHG") and an EIR must be prepared. Moreover, the MND should have been recirculated under CEQA when new information and GHG thresholds were added at the last
minute by the City Council. So too, the August 24, 2022 CEQA Notice of Determination filed by the City was premature and invalid because it was filed before any of the Project Approvals were final. Also, the MND lacks all feasible, appropriate and enforceable mitigation as CEQA requires.

Petitioners will seek to have the Project Approvals and CEQA environmental approvals enjoined and set aside, along with such other relief as the Court deems proper.

Sincerely,

LAW OFFICE OF GIDEON KRACOV
