VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Laborers International Union of North America, Local Union 294 and Eddie Armando Torres

2 ("Petitioners") petition this Court for a writ of mandate directed to Respondents County of Tulare,

3 the Board of Supervisors of the County of Tulare, and Tulare County Resource Management Agency

4 (collectively "Respondents" or "County") and Real Party in Interest G4 Enterprises Ltd. ("Real

5 Party"), and by this verified petition, allege as follows:

6 INTRODUCTION

7 1. This action alleges violations of the California Environmental Quality Act, Public

8 Resources Code sections 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"), by the County regarding their approval of an

9 amendment to the Goshen Community Plan, General Plan Amendment No. GPA 22-002, and Zone

10 Change No. PZC 22-008 ("Project"), both of which were approved through the use of an addendum

11 to the 2018 Goshen Community Plan Environmental Impact Report ("2018 Goshen EIR").

12 2. Located in the census-designated place of Goshen in Tulare County, California, the

13 Project proposes the expansion of the County's Urban Development boundary to encompass an

14 additional 30 acres of agricultural land, and would change the existing zoning of the area from

15 Exclusive Agricultural zoning to Light Industrial, facilitating the anticipated future use of the site by

16 Real Party in Interest to construct and operate one or more industrial buildings with an anticipated

17 footprint of up to 1.25 million square feet with 2,200 parking stalls.

18 3. In 2018, the County certified the 2018 Goshen EIR, which evaluated the potential

19 environmental impacts associated with the development goals of the community of Goshen,

20 consistent with Goshen's General Plan 2030 Update. This 2018 Goshen EIR is a first tier EIR that

21 evaluates the potential effects of the 2018 Goshen Community Plan ("Community Plan") at a

22 program level. The 2018 Goshen EIR only evaluated the potential future buildout of 200,980 square

23 feet of all industrial uses through the year 2030. The 2018 Goshen Community Plan also did not

24 include the 30 acres of the Project's proposed site within the areas zoned for industrial uses. As a

25 result, the Project was not within the scope of the 2018 Goshen EIR. The 2018 Goshen EIR did not

26 mention or discuss the Project.

27 4. On October 27, 2022, at the request of the Tulare County Resource Management

28 Agency, the Board of Supervisors of the County of Tulare approved the Project, despite the absence

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 of an initial study examining potential environmental impacts associated with the Project, including

2 potential air quality emissions from thousands of trucks and vehicle trips, greenhouse gas emission

3 impacts, and direct wildlife impacts on special-status species using the site for habitat, nesting,

4 foraging, or movement.

5 5. Rather than preparing an initial study and analyzing the Project's potential significant

6 a environmental impacts in a mitigated negative declaration ("MND") or EIR, as required by CEQA,

7 the County prepared an addendum to the 2018 Goshen EIR for the Project. The County claims that

8 the Project is within the scope of the 2018 Goshen EIR and that based on its evaluation, an

9 addendum is appropriate pursuant to 14 Cal. Admin. Code § 15168. The County further asserts that

10 there has been no significant new information or changes in circumstances since 2018 warranting

11 substantial changes to the 2018 Goshen EIR.

12 6. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by relying on the 2018 Goshen EIR

13 despite the 2018 Goshen EIR not having addressed the Project, and without any environmental

14 review of the Project under CEQA. "If the subsequent project is not consistent with the program or

15 plan, it is treated as a new project and must be fully analyzed in a projector another tiered EIR if it

16 may have a significant effect on the environment." (Friends of Mammoth v. Town of Mammoth

17 Lakes Redevelopment Agency (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 511, 528-529; Friends of Coll. of San Mateo

18 Gardens v. San Mateo Cty. Cmty. Coll. Dist. (2016) 1 Cal.5th 937, 960.) Because the Project is not

19 consistent with the Community Plan, and indeed proposes to expand it and add in a newly zoned

20 industrial area, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by adopting the Addendum and

21 failing to prepare an initial study leading to either a MND or an EIR for the Project. Accordingly, the

22 approval of the Project and the Addendum should be set aside and the County should be required to

23 prepare an initial study and fully comply with CEQA prior to considering whether to approve the
24 Project.

25 7. Alternatively, assuming the Project's additional 30 acres and changed zoning is

26 consistent with the Community Plan, the County still may not avoid preparing an initial study and

27 either a negative declaration or EIR for subsequent specific projects within the Community Plan

28 area. "If the subsequent project is consistent with the program or plan for which the [program] EIR

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 was certified, then 'CEQA requires a lead agency to prepare an initial study to determine if the later

2 project may cause significant environmental effects not examined in the first tier EIR.™ (Friends of

3 Coll. of San Mateo, Cal.5th at 960.) Instead of determining whether the Project may cause

4 significant environmental effects not considered in the 2018 Goshen EIR, the County limited its

5 review to whether the Project would cause any new significant environmental impacts or an increase

6 in the severity of significant impacts previously studied in the 2018 Goshen EIR. Based on that

7 truncated review under CEQA and without completing the requisite initial study and either a MND

8 or EIR, the County claims an addendum to the 2018 Goshen EIR is adequate to address the Project.

9 This Petition seeks to vacate the Addendum.

10 PARTIES

11 8. Petitioner EDDIE ARMANDO TORRES is a resident of Visalia, California. Mr.

12 Torres frequently visits or passes through the area of the Project site. Mr. Torres is interested in

13 ensuring that the County and Real Party fully comply with CEQA to ensure that all environmental

14 impacts are mitigated to the maximum extent feasible. Mr. Torres is member of Laborers

15 International Union of North America, Local Union 294.

16 9. Petitioner LABORERS INTERNATIONAL UNION OF NORTH AMERICA,

17 LOCAL UNION 294 ("Local 294") is a labor organization that has more than 1,500 members

18 residing in Tulare, Fresno, Madera and Kings Counties. Local 294 has more than 450 members who

19 live in the County of Tulare, with almost half of those members living in the Visalia and Goshen area.

20 Local 294's purposes include advocating on behalf of its members to ensure safe workplace

21 environments; working to protect recreational opportunities for its members to improve its members'

22 quality of life when off the job; advocating to assure its members' access to safe, healthful,

23 productive, and aesthetically and culturally pleasing surroundings on and off the job; promoting

24 environmentally sustainable businesses and development projects on behalf of its members, including

25 providing comments raising environmental concerns and benefits on proposed development projects;

26 advocating for changes to proposed development projects that will help to achieve a balance between

27 employment, the human population, and resource use to permit high standards of living and a wide

28 sharing of life's amenities by its members as well as the general public; advocating for steps to

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 preserve important historic, cultural, and natural aspects of our national heritage, and maintain,

2 wherever possible, an environment that supports diversity and variety of individual choice;

3 advocating on behalf of its members for programs, policies, and development projects that promote

4 not only good jobs but also healthy natural environment and working environment, including

5 advocating for changes to proposed projects and policies that, if adopted, would reduce air, soil, and

6 water pollution, minimize harm to wildlife, conserve wild places, reduce traffic congestion, reduce

7 global warming impacts, and assure compliance with applicable land use ordinances; and working to

8 attain the widest range of beneficial uses of the environment without degradation, risk to health or

9 safety, or other undesirable or unintended consequences.

10 10. Local 294, its members, and Mr. Torres have direct and beneficial interests in

11 Respondents' compliance with laws bearing upon approval of the Project. These interests will be

12 directly and adversely affected by the Project, which violates the law as set forth in this Petition. The

13 maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a substantial benefit on Petitioners and the

14 public by protecting Petitioners and the public from the environmental and other harms alleged below

15 and others that may exist but are unknown due to the lack of a full environmental analysis of the

16 Project.

17 11. Respondent COUNTY OF TULARE is the "lead agency" for the Project for purposes

18 of Public Resources Code section 21067, and has principal responsibility for conducting
19 environmental review for the Project and taking other actions necessary to comply with CEQA.

20 12. Respondent BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OF THE COUNTY OF TULARE ("Board

21 of Supervisors") is a municipal body and is the decision-making body of the County of Tulare.

22 Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that on or about October 27, 2022, the

23 Board of Supervisors approved the Project and the accompanying Addendum and otherwise

24 authorized the Project to proceed.

25 13. Respondent TULARE COUNTY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AGENCY

26 (*Resource Management Agency") is a municipal body established by Section 1-03-1070 of the

27 Tulare County Code. It is the responsibility of the Resource Management Agency to approve and

28 execute agreements for the purchase of real property. The Resource Management Agency is

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 identified as the applicant for the Project. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege,

2 that on or about September 28, 2022, the Resource Management Agency recommended that the

3 Planning Commission recommend approval of the Project to the Board of Supervisors.

4 14. Real Party in Interest G4 ENTERPRISES LTD. is a California limited partnership.

5 Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that G4 Enterprises Ltd. is the owner of

6 the proposed Project site.

7 15. Petitioners do not know the true names or capacities of the persons or entities sued as

8 Respondents DOES through X, inclusive, nor of Real Parties in Interest ROES through X,

9 inclusive, and therefore sue these respondents and real parties by their fictitious names. Petitioners

10 will amend the Petition to set forth the names and capacities of the Doe respondents along with

11 appropriate charging allegations when such information has been ascertained.

12 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

13 16. Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 (alternatively section

14 1094.5) and Public Resources Code sections 21168.5 (alternatively section 21168) and 21168.9, this

15 Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandate to set aside Respondents' decision to approve the

16 Addendum for the Project and to remedy Respondents' failure to prepare an initial study and conduct

17 a proper CEQA review.

18 17. Venue is proper in this Court because the causes of action alleged in this Petition

19 arose in the County of Tulare and the Project will occur within the County of Tulare and the

20 environmental impacts of the Project will be acutely felt within the County.

21 18. This petition is timely filed within all applicable statutes of limitations. This action is

22 timely under CEQA because it is filed within 30 days of the Notice of Determination filed by the

23 County. (PRC § 21167.)

24 19. Petitioners performed all conditions precedent to filing this action by complying with

25 the requirements of PRC § 21167.5 by serving prior notice of the petition in this action. A copy of

26 the written notice and proof of service is attached as Exhibit A to the Petition in this action.

27 20. Pursuant to PRC § 21167.6(b), Petitioners have elected to prepare the record of

28 proceedings in this matter, and are simultaneously filing their notice of intent to prepare said record

6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 of proceedings with this petition. A true and correct copy of Petitioners' Notice of Intent to Prepare

2 the Record is attached to this petition as Exhibit B.

3 21. Petitioners will provide notice of this action to the Attorney General of the State of

4 California, by serving copy of this Petition along with a notice of its filing, as required by PRC §

5 21167.7 and CCP § 388. §

6 22. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this instant action

7 and have exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

8 23. Petitioners have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

9 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to set aside the County's actions taken in

10 violation of CEQA and to require Respondents to prepare an EIR or other legally adequate CEQA

11 document for the Project. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' decision will remain in

12 violation of state law.

13 CEOA LEGAL BACKGROUND

14 24. CEQA mandates that "the long-term protection of the environment…shall be the

15 guiding criterion in public decisions" throughout California. (Pub. Res. Code § 21001(d).) The

16 foremost principle under CEQA is that it is to be "interpreted in such a manner as to afford the fullest

17 possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language."

18 (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 563-64.) An agency's action

19 violates CEQA if it "thwarts the statutory goals" of "informed decisionmaking" and "informed public
20 participation." (Kings Co. Farm Bur. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 712.)

21 25. CEQA has two primary purposes. First, CEQA is designed to inform decision makers

22 and the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of a project. (14 Cal. Admin

23 Code ("CEQA Guidelines") § 15002(a)(1).) Second, CEQA requires public agencies to avoid or

24 reduce environmental damage when "feasible" by requiring "environmentally superior" alternatives

25 and all feasible mitigation measures. (CEQA Guidelines § 15002(a)(2) and (3).)

26 26. The EIR is an "environmental 'alarm bell' whose purpose is to alert the public and its

27 responsible officials to environmental changes before they have reached the ecological points of no

28 return." (Bakersfield Citizens for Local Control v. City of Bakersfield (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1184,

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 1220.) The EIR also functions as a "document of accountability," intended to "demonstrate to an

2 apprehensive citizenry that the agency has, in fact, analyzed and considered the ecological

3 implications of its action." (Laurel Heights Improvements Assn. V. Regents of University of California

4 (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392.) The EIR process "protects not only the environment but also informed
5 self-government." (Pocket Protectors v. City of Sacramento (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 903, 927

6 ("Pocket Protectors").)

7 27. CEQA requires that an agency analyze the potential environmental impacts of its

8 proposed actions in an EIR except in certain limited circumstances. (See Pub. Res. Code, § 21100.)

9 An EIR is required if "there is substantial evidence, in light of the whole record before the lead

10 agency, that the project may have a significant effect on the environment." (Pub. Res. Code, §

11 21080(d); see also Pocket Protectors, 124 Cal.App.4th at 927.) This evidentiary standard is generally

12 referred to as the "fair argument" standard.

13 28. "Significant environmental effect" is defined very broadly as "a substantial or

14 potentially substantial adverse change in the environment." (Pub. Res. Code, § 21068; see also

15 CEQA Guidelines § 15382.) An effect on the environment need not be "momentous" to meet the

16 CEQA test for significance; it is enough that the impacts are "not trivial." (No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los

17 Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 83.)

18 29. The County's 2018 Goshen EIR was a program EIR addressing the environmental

19 impacts of the Community Plan on a program level. "A program EIR is an EIR which may be

20 prepared on a series of actions that can be characterized as one large project and are related either: (1)

21 Geographically, (2) As logical parts in the chain of contemplated actions, (3) In connection with

22 issuance of rules, regulations, plans, or other general criteria to govern the conduct of a continuing

23 program, or (4) As individual activities carried out under the same authorizing statutory or regulatory

24 authority and having generally similar environmental effects which can be mitigated in similar ways."

25 (CEQA Guidelines § 15168(a).)

26 30. The CEQA Guidelines allow for tiering, which permits a lead agency to "us[e] the

27 analysis of general matters contained in a broader EIR (such as one prepared for a general plan or

28 policy statement) with later EIRs and negative declarations on narrower projects; incorporating by

8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 reference the general discussions from the broader EIR; and concentrating the later EIR or negative

2 declaration solely on the issues specific to the later project." (CEQA Guidelines § 15152(a).) "Where

3 a prior environmental impact report has been prepared and certified for a program, plan, policy, or

4 ordinance, the lead agency for a later project that meets the requirements of this section shall examine

5 significant effects of the later project upon the environment by using a tiered environmental impact

6 report...." (Pub. Res. Code § 21094(a).) "Agencies are encouraged to tier the environmental analyses

7 which they prepare for separate but related projects including general plans, zoning changes, and

8 development projects." (CEQA Guidelines § 15152(a).

9 31. CEQA's authority for an agency to tier a project from a Program EIR "applies only to

10 a later project that the lead agency determines is all of the following: (1) Consistent with the program,

11 plan, policy, or ordinance for which an environmental impact report has been prepared and certified.

12 (2) Consistent with applicable local land use plans and zoning of the city, county, or city and county

13 1n which the later project would be located."(Pub. Res. Code § 21094(b).)

14 32. The CEQA Guidelines set forth the use of a Program EIR with later activities. "Later

15 activities in the program must be examined in the light of the program EIR to determine whether an

16 additional environmental document must be prepared." (CEQA Guidelines § 15168(c).) Section

17 15168(c) provides:

18 (1) If a later activity would have effects that were not examined in the program EIR,

19 a new initial study would need to be prepared leading to either an EIR or a negative
declaration. That later analysis may tier from the program EIR as provided in Section
20 15152.
(2) If the agency finds that pursuant to Section 15162, no subsequent EIR would be
21 required, the agency can approve the activity as being within the scope of the project

22 covered by the program EIR, and no new environmental document would be required.
Whether a later activity is within the scope of a program EIR is a factual question that
23 the lead agency determines based on substantial evidence in the record. Factors that an

24 agency may consider in making that determination include, but are not limited to,
consistency of the later activity with the type of allowable land use, overall planned

25 density and building intensity, geographic area analyzed for environmental impacts, and covered infrastructure, as described in the program EIR.
26 (3) An agency shall incorporate feasible mitigation measures and alternatives

27 developed in the program EIR into later activities in the program. (4) Where the later activities involve site specific operations, the agency should use a

28 written checklist or similar device to document the evaluation of the site and the

9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 activity to determine whether the environmental effects of the operation were within the

2 scope of the program EIR.
(5) A program EIR will be most helpful in dealing with later activities if it provides a
3 description of planned activities that would implement the program and deals with the
effects of the program as specifically and comprehensively as possible. With a good
4 and detailed project description and analysis of the program, many later activities could

5 be found to be within the scope of the project described in the program EIR, and no
further environmental documents would be required.

6
(CEQA Guidelines § 15168(c)(1)-(5) [emphasis added].) 7
33. A subsequent project is not within the scope of a previous Program EIR if it is 8
inconsistent with the plan addressed in the Program EIR. (CEQA Guidelines § 15168(c)(2); See Pub.
9

10 Res. Code § 21094(b).) "If the subsequent project is not consistent with the program or plan, it is

11 treated as a new project and must be fully analyzed in a project-or another tiered EIR if it may

12 have a significant effect on the environment." (Friends of Coll. of San Mateo Garden, 1 Cal.5th at

13 960, citing Friends of Mammoth, at pp. 528-529.) [emphasis added].)

34.
14 Even if a proposed project is consistent with an adopted community plan and is tiering

15 from a Program EIR as provided in CEQA Guidelines Section 15152, if that project has effects not

16 examined in the Program EIR, an initial study is required. "If the subsequent project is consistent
with the
17 program or plan for which the EIR was certified, then "CEQA requires a lead agency to

18 prepare an initial study to determine if the later project may cause significant environmental effects
not examined in the first tier EIR. (Friends of Coll. of San Mateo Garden, 1 Cal.5th at 960, citing
19

20 Pub. Resources Code, § 21094(a), (c) [emphasis added].) The CEQA Guidelines also limit the
subsequent tiered analysis to an EIR or negative declaration:
21

22 Where an EIR has been prepared and certified for a program, plan, policy, or ordinance
consistent with the requirements of [CEQA Guidelines § 15152], any lead agency for a

23 later project pursuant to or consistent with the program, plan, policy, or ordinance should limit the EIR or negative declaration on the later project to effects which:
24 (1) Were not examined as significant effects on the environment in the prior EIR; or

25 (2) Are susceptible to substantial reduction or avoidance by the choice of specific
revisions in the project, by the imposition of conditions, or other means.
26 (CEQA Guidelines § 15152(d) [emphasis added].)

27 STATEMENT OF FACTS

28 35. The Project amends the County's General Plan to change the Goshen Urban

10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Development Boundary to encompass an additional 30 acres of agricultural land. The Project also

2 proposes to change the land use designation of the 30 acres from "Agriculture" to "Light Industrial."

3 The Project also amends the Tulare County Zoning Ordinance to change the zoning for the 30-acres

4 from Exclusive Agricultural to Light Manufacturing. By making these changes to the General Plan

5 and the zoning, the Project anticipates the development of a 1.25 million square foot building

6 footprint with 2,200 parking stalls on a 73-acre parcel zoned in its entirety for Light Industrial uses.

7 36. The 2018 Goshen Community Plan EIR was prepared as a Program EIR for the

8 community of Goshen to promote development within its planning area. The Tulare County

9 Planning Commission agenda for the Project admits that in 2014, staff considered bringing the

10 parcels which compose the proposed Project into the Community Plan's Urban Development

11 Boundary, but decided in 2018 that the parcels would instead be incorporated at a later time.

12 Elsewhere, the Planning Commission agenda states that the Project area was "inadvertently 'split

13 zoned' due to some uncertainty about development capacity and property owner interest that was not

14 rectified before the [Goshen Community] Plan was adopted in 2018." Regardless of the reasoning,

15 there can be no dispute that Project is not consistent with the Community Plan. The Project expands

16 the boundaries of the Community Plan. The Project adds additional land zoned for industrial use to

17 the Community Plan.

18 37. The Project's environmental impacts were not analyzed in the 2018 Goshen

19 Community Plan EIR because the Project, the expansion of the County's Urban Development

20 boundary to encompass an additional 30 acres, and to change the Exclusive Agricultural zoning to

21 Light Industrial, were not analyzed in the 2018 Goshen EIR. The Project's environmental impacts as

22 a result of its proposed use, including among others air quality impacts, greenhouse gas emission

23 impacts, and impacts on wildlife, were not analyzed in the 2018 Goshen EIR.

24 38. Although the study area employed for the 2018 Goshen EIR encompassed the 30

25 acres included in the Project, the 2018 Goshen EIR did not evaluate the impacts of extending the

26 Urban Development boundary to encompass those 30 acres. Nor did the 2018 Goshen EIR evaluate

27 any air quality, greenhouse gas, wildlife, or other impacts from designating this 30-acre area as light

28 industrial and changing its zoning to Light Manufacturing.

11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 39. By adding 30 acres of agricultural lands to the Community Plan and rezoning them

2 from Exclusive Agricultural to Light Industrial, the Project anticipates the development of a 1.25

3 million square foot building footprint with 2,200 parking stalls on a 73-acre parcel zoned for Light a

4 Industrial uses. The County has failed to analyze the potential impacts on air quality, greenhouse gas

5 emissions, wildlife, and other environmental conditions of the Project's expansion of industrial uses

6 on the additional 30 acres, as well as within the Community Plan. The 2018 Goshen EIR only

7 addressed an anticipated buildout and operation of industrial uses within the Community Plan

8 boundary totaling 266,610 square feet. A Project contemplating an additional 1.25 million square

9 feet of industrial uses, and 2,200 vehicles, 30-acres of which will be outside of the Community Plan

10 boundary on what is currently agricultural land, was not addressed by the Goshen EIR.

11 40. The County has failed to analyze the potential impacts on special-status species from

12 the proposed expansion of the urban growth boundary and rezoning of 30 acres for industrial uses.

13 These include impacts such as habitat loss and fragmentation and interference with wildlife

14 movement. The 2018 Goshen EIR only analyzed biological resources impacts within the Community

15 Plan boundary, and therefore did not consider potential species impacts on the 30 acres of the Project

16 site which were not included in the 2018 Goshen EIR.

17 41. Even assuming that the County may tier review for the Project off of the 2018

18 Goshen EIR pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Sections 15162 and 15164, an initial study is still

19 required for the Project because it is later activity which would have impacts not examined in the

20 2018 Goshen EIR. As stated above, the addition of 30 additional acres and the rezoning of those

21 acres to Light Industrial would have impacts not previously examined. Based on the initial study, the

22 County may then determine if a negative declaration or an EIR is required for the Project.

23 PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

24 42. In February 2018, the County prepared a Draft Environmental Impact Report for the

25 Goshen Community Plan.

26 43. In or around September 2022, Respondents published the agenda for a Planning a

27 Commission hearing which would consider the proposed Project, and consider the County's decision

28 to conduct CEQA review for the Project through the use of an Addendum to the 2018 Goshen EIR.

12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 44. On September 27, 2022, Petitioners submitted written comments to the Planning

2 Commission requesting that the County prepare an EIR for the Project, and stating that the County

3 could not rely on the 2018 Goshen EIR. Petitioners noted that the Project was not analyzed in the

4 2018 Goshen EIR, and that even if it was, an initial study was required to assess whether a negative

5 declaration or an EIR should be required.

6 45. On September 28, 2022, the Tulare County Planning Commission held a public

7 hearing regarding the Project.

8 46. On October 25, 2022, the Board of Supervisors considered and approved the

9 Addendum for the Project.

10 47. On October 26, 2022, the Resource Management Agency filed a Notice of

11 Determination ("NOD") determining that the Project would have no significant effect on the

12 environment that was not already contemplated in the 2018 Goshen EIR, and stating that an

13 Addendum to the 2018 Goshen EIR was adopted for the Project.

14 48. On November 4, 2022, Petitioners sent the Respondents a notice of their intent to file

15 an action under CEQA challenging the approval of the Project and adoption of the Addendum.

16 49. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law

17 within the meaning of CCP § 1086, § in that Respondents' approval of the Project and the associated

18 addendum, and failure to prepare an EIR or mitigated negative declaration for the Project, are not

19 a otherwise reviewable in a manner that provides an adequate remedy. Accordingly, Petitioners seek

20 this Court's review of Respondents' approval of the Project and issuance of an addendum to the

21 2018 Goshen EIR to rectify the violations of CEQA.

22 50. Unless subject to a stay of the approvals and Project, Respondents will implement the

23 Project despite their lack of compliance with CEQA. Petitioners will suffer irreparable harm by

24 Respondents' failure to take the required steps to comply with CEQA's procedures and protect the

25 environment.

26 CLAIMS FOR RELIEF

27 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
28 (Violations of CEQA - Prejudicial Abuse of Discretion in Approving Addendum)

51. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate all of the above paragraphs as if fully set

13
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 forth herein.

2 52. Respondents abused their discretion by finding that the Project is within the scope of

3 the 2018 Goshen EIR. The 2018 Goshen EIR was a programmatic review of the Goshen Community

4 Plan. The 2018 Goshen EIR did not address the Project. The Project was not within the boundary of

5 the planning area considered in the 2018 Goshen EIR. The Project anticipates development of at

6 least 1 million more square feet of industrial uses than were considered in the 2018 Goshen EIR. In

7 finding that the Project was within the scope of the 2018 Goshen EIR, Respondents proceeded in a

8 manner inconsistent with law and without substantial evidence in the record. Because the Project is

9 not consistent with the Community Plan, it must be "treated a as a new project and must be fully

10 analyzed in a project-or another tiered EIR if it may have a significant effect on the environment."

11 (Friends of Coll. of San Mateo Garden, 1 Cal.5th at 960.)

12 53. Because Respondents abused their discretion in approving an addendum for the

13 Project, the Court should vacate the Addendum and require the preparation of an appropriate CEQA

14 document, i.e, either a negative declaration or EIR.

15 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

16 (In the Alternative, Violation of CEQA - Need to Prepare an Initial Study and Either a Negative Declaration or EIR)
17 54. Assuming the Project is within the scope of the 2018 Community Plan and 2018
18 Goshen EIR, Respondents failed to comply with CEQA by failing to prepare an initial study for the
19 Project evaluating whether the Project may have one or more significant environmental impacts
20 which were not previously analyzed in the 2018 Goshen EIR. (Friends of Coll. of San Mateo
21 Garden, 1 Cal.5th at 960.) These include potential air quality, greenhouse gas emission, wildlife, and
22 other impacts which were not assessed because the Project site was not within the boundary of the
23 2018 Goshen EIR and because the Project anticipates a dramatic expansion of industrial uses within
24 the original and expanded Community Plan area.
25 55. Because Respondents abused their discretion in failing to prepare an initial study for
26 the Project, the Court should vacate the Addendum and require the preparation of an initial study to
27 determine the appropriate CEQA document for the Project, i.e, either a negative declaration or EIR.

1 PRAYER

2 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for the following relief:

3 1. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents to:

4 a. Set aside their approval of the Project;

5 b. Set aside the Addendum and Notice of Determination for the Project;

6 C. Set aside any and all other actions approving or granting any permits,

7 entitlements, financing, or other approvals referring or related to the Project

8 unless and until Respondents have prepared, circulated, and considered a
legally adequate CEQA document prior to any subsequent action taken to
10 approve the Project.

11 2. For a preliminary and permanent stay of Respondents' approvals of the Project;

12 3. For the costs of suit.

13 4. For an award of attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure $1021.5 and any

14 other applicable provisions of law.

15 5. For any other legal and equitable relief as this Court deems just and proper.
