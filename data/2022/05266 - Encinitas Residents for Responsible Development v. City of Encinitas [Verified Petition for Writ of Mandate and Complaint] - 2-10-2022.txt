24 1. Petitioner and plaintiff Encinitas Residents for Responsible Development

25 ("ERRD") files this action to enforce the Subdivision Map Act ("SMA"), the Encinitas

26 Municipal Code ("EMC"), and the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources

27 Code $21000, et seq. ("CEQA"), via the issuance of one or more writs of mandamus, ordering

28 respondent and defendant City of Encinitas ("City" or "Respondent") to rescind its November

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

10, 2021 final decision made via Resolution 2021-95, entitled "A Resolution Of The City Of

2 Encinitas City Council Denying The Appeal Of Encinitas Residents For Responsible

3 Development (ERRD) To Set Aside The Decision Of The Planning Commission And

4 Approving A Boundary Adjustment To Consolidate Four Underlying Legal Lots Into One Lot

5 For The Property Located At 2220, 2228 & 2230 Encinitas Boulevard" denying ERRD's appeal

6 and upholding the August 19, 2021 decision of the Encinitas Planning Commission ("Planning

7 Commission") approved via PC Resolution No. 2021-31, entitled "A Resolution of the City of
Encinitas Planning Commission Approving : Boundary Line Adjustment to Consolidate Four
Underlying Legal Lots Into One for the Property Located at 2220, 2228 & 2230 Encinitas

10 Boulevard" (the "Lot Consolidation" or "Project").

11 2. ERRD also seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to enforce and enjoin City's

12 incorrect interpretation and application of the SMA and City's ordinance, set forth in Chapter

13 24.70 of the EMC, and City's requirement to perform CEQA for possible lot consolidation

14 approvals.

15 3. ERRD separately seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to correct and enjoin

16 City's incorrect interpretation and application of laws and rules that pertain to by-right and

17 CEQA exemptions in this case, specifically as to (1) Government Code § 65583.2, subdivision

18 (h) which requires a 20% threshold of all units in a development be affordable housing in order

19 for a development to qualify as "by-right" pursuant to Government Code § 65583.2; (2)

20 Government Code § 65583.2, subd. (i), which does not exempt by-right development projects

21 from the implementation of required CEQA mitigation measures determined and adopted by

22 programmatic environmental reviews, including state-mandated Housing Element of City's

23 general plan; and (3) EMC § 30.16.010 which requires that base density in the R-30 zone is

24 calculated using net acreage of the project site and includes reductions in base density, for

25 example, the Encinitas Hillside/Inland Bluff Overlay Zone ("Hillside Zone"), and other

26 development constraints that, regardless of the method of calculation, preclude the inclusion of

27 highway acreage to calculate base density.

2 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

4. Petitioner and plaintiff Encinitas Residents for Responsible Development

4 ("Petitioner" or "ERRD"), is a not-for-profit public benefit entity within the state of California

5 and County of San Diego which, along with its supporters whom reside within the City of

6 Encinitas, are residents and/or taxpayers within the geographical area of the subject city.

7 ERRD is supported by citizens and residents of Encinitas and its surrounding communities and

8 is supported by other local civic groups and nonprofit corporations due to its beneficial
community work. ERRD has collectively formed and is currently united for the purpose to

10 maintain the quality of life in Encinitas, including promoting responsible development,

11 ensuring the environmental, public safety, and economic impacts of large-scale and intensive
12 development, to ensure proper studies minimization of adverse effects of development on the
13 environment and community. ERRD and its supporters use, enjoy and benefit from the

14 resources affected by City's actions. City's actions adversely affect the recreational,

15 vocational, aesthetic, scientific, environmental and economic interests of ERRD and of

16 ERRD's supporters. ERRD and its supporters have been injured as a result of City's actions,

17 because the decisions of City will have detrimental impacts on ERRD, its supporters, and the

18 general public who reside in and around the city. ERRD has standing to enforce such laws that

19 are designed to protect the environment from unmitigated adverse impacts under the California

20 Environmental Quality Act.

21 5. Respondent and defendant City of Encinitas ("Respondent" or "City") is a

22 general law city of the State of California charged with complying with applicable provisions

23 of state law, including the SMA, CEQA, the general laws of this State, the California

24 Constitution, Encinitas Municipal Code (EMC) and other regulations of the City of Encinitas.

25 For the purposes herein, the "City" includes all of its departments, officers, elected officials,

26 and appointed and elected City Council members charged with the duties and obligations as

27 alleged herein. City, through its respective departments, officers, elected officials, and

28 appointed and elected City Council members, took final action to consider and approve the

- 3 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Project, without lawful compliance with the SMA, EMC, and CEQA, on November 10, 2021.

2 Relevant to this action, it is also alleged that City has consistently misinterpreted state density

3 bonus law ("DBL"), CEQA, and its own municipal code in the consideration of the subject

4 Project and the development project of Real Party in Interest (defined below.)

5 6. Real Party in Interest, Encinitas Blvd. Apartments 6.95, LP, by and through its

6 representative, agent, and general partner, Randy Goodson, is the representative applicant for

7 the herein challenged development applications and project (referred to herein as "Applicant"

8 or "Real Party"). Real Party has a direct interest in this lawsuit, as it pertains to ERRD's
challenges to the Lot Consolidation and City's findings and decision related to the denial of the

10 underlying residential development project ("Encinitas Blvd. Project") involving the questions

11 and issues involving by-right development requirements, programmatic environmental review

12 in by-right projects, and City's manner of calculating base density based on gross, as opposed

13 to net acreage.

14 7. ERRD is ignorant of the true names and capacities of the defendants and

15 respondents sued herein as DOES ONE through THIRTY, inclusive, and therefore sues these

16 defendants by such fictitious names. ERRD will amend this complaint to allege their true names

17 and capacities when ascertained. ERRD also designates all persons unknown as those claiming

18 any interests in the Project, Lot Consolidation, Encinitas Blvd. Project or issues of law raised in

19 this lawsuit.

20 8. This lawsuit has been commenced within the time limits imposed for actions

21 under the California Code of Civil Procedure, Public Resources Code, and Government Code,

22 and specifically the 90-day statute of limitations in the SMA, as made applicable to City by its

23 own policies, regulations, or by the general laws of this State.

24 9. Venue and jurisdiction in this Court are proper pursuant to the California Code

25 of Civil Procedure for a matter relating to subject property located within, and an

26 administrative action decided within the Court's geographical venue jurisdiction.

27 10. Prior to and on the appeal decision date of November 10, 2021, ERRD, by and

28 through its supporters and attorneys, or other members of the public and local residents, made

- 4-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

oral and written comments, and have been present, participated in one or more Planning

2 Commission and City Council hearings, and have otherwise previously raised the legal

3 deficiencies to the City that are asserted in this petition for writ of mandate.

4 11. ERRD has performed all conditions precedent to filing this action by complying

5 with all requirements of California law and procedure, including giving a required written

6 notice of this lawsuit prior to filing this action, and ERRD has no other remedy other than to

7 bring this action. All other requests of City, having been previously made, would be futile.

12. ERRD has appealed and exhausted all administrative remedies, including but
not limited to: (1) providing written comment prior to the June 17, 2021 Planning Commission

10 meeting; (2) providing written and oral comment prior to the continued July 15, 2021 Planning

11 Commission (continued and decided August 19, 2021 without further oral comment); (3) and

12 appeal to the Encinitas City Council filed August 30, 2021, originally heard on October 13,

13 2021, and continued to the final hearing and decision on November 10, 2021 challenged herein.

14 IIL.

15 FACTUAL, LEGAL AND PROCEDURAL

16 BACKGROUND GIVING RISE TO THIS ACTION

17 City's Final Approval of the Lot Consolidation and Failure to Make Legally

18 and Factually Supported Findings

13.
19 Real party in interest Encinitas Boulevard Apartments 6.95, LP, via its

20 representative Randy Goodson ("Real Party") applied to develop a currently numbered 277-

21 Unit Apartment Development for the property located at 2220, 2228 & 2230 Encinitas

22 Boulevard ("Encinitas Blvd. Project").

14.
23 As part of the application for the Encinitas Blvd. Project, unification of multiple

24 separate lots and legal parcels is required. Rather than seek lot consolidation or new

25 subdivision map under the SMA, Real Party sought a lot line adjustment to consolidate lots

26 pursuant to EMC § § 24.70.010 ("Lot Consolidation").

27

28

- 5 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

15. Planning Commission originally set a hearing date of June 17, 2021 for

2 consideration for the Lot Consolidation for the properties located at 2220, 2228 & 2230

3 Encinitas Boulevard, as well as consideration of the Encinitas Blvd. Project.

4 16. ERRD submitted a comment letter in advance of the June 17, 2021 hearing that

5 identified multiple legal deficiencies that precluded the grant of the Lot Consolidation, and

6 requested denial of the Encinitas Blvd. Project based on multiple legal grounds, including the

7 inapplicability of a by-right qualification for the project, lack of proper implementation of

8 CEQA, and improper application of total density based on the failure to apply EMC
requirements for calculating base density.

10 17. The original hearing date was continued to July 15, 2021. ERRD submitted

11 further written and oral comments opposing the approval of the Lot Consolidation and

12 Encinitas Blvd. Project. At the July 15, 2021 hearing date, Planning Commission took public

13 comment and debated the Lot Consolidation and Encinitas Blvd. Project, however, a vote was

14 not held until Planning Commission continued and heard the item on August 19, 2021.

15 18. On August 19, 2021, after allowing and receiving written comment, but without

16 taking any further oral testimony, Planning Commission approved the Lot Consolidation, and

17 separately voted to deny the Encinitas Blvd. Project.

18 19. Planning Commission's rejection of the Encinitas Blvd. Project was based on

19 denying Goodon's requested density bonus waivers and denying a Design Review permit. In

20 addition to ERRD's objections to the Lot Consolidation, ERRD argued that the denial of the

21 Encinitas Blvd. Project failed to make correct findings and proper interpretations of law for

22 multiple issues raised by ERRD.

23 20. ERRD timely appealed the August 19, 2020 Planning Commission decisions.

24 ERRD appealed the Lot Consolidation and City's incorrect findings on the multiple issues

25 raised by ERRD related to the Encinitas Blvd. Project. For the purposes of this lawsuit, in

26 addition to the reasons set forth in the exhaustive written and verbal comments, City failed to

27 correctly interpret the law and made incorrect findings as follows: First, City incorrectly

28 interpreted the by-right provisions of state law in determining whether the 20% affordable

- 6 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

housing threshold was met. Second, City incorrectly determined that by-right projects are not

2 required to implement mitigation measures approved in prior programmatic environmental

3 review. To the contrary, mitigation measures in programmatic environmental review are

4 mandatory, even if new CEQA study is exempted or not required. Third, City misinterpreted

5 and unlawfully implemented the use of gross acreage to calculate base density, and refused to

6 implement its Municipal Code standard of using "net acreage" to determine base density, and

7 otherwise failed to account for other required reductions in base density.

21. On appeal from Planning Commission, the City Council originally set a hearing
date for October 13, 2021. After hearing substantial staff, applicant, and public comment, the

10 October 13th hearing date was continued to November 10, 2021.

11 22. On November 10, 2021 the City Council denied ERRD's appeals on all grounds.

12 23. ERRD timely filed and served this Petition within the 90-day limitations period

13 specified in Government Code § 66499.37, Code of Civil Procedure 1094.5, and Public

14 Resources Code § 21168.

15 IV.

16 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION - PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

17 Violation of the Subdivision Map Act, Encinitas Municipal Code

18 (Government Code § 66410 et seq.; Encinitas Municipal Code Chapter 24.70)

19 24. Petitioner hereby re-alleges and incorporates by reference 11 1-23 above as
20 though fully set forth herein.

21 25. City's action via Resolution 2021-95 and PC Resolution No. 2021-31 approved

22 the consolidation of the lots designated APN: 259-231-28, -30, -31 & -32.

23 26. The Lot Consolidation segregates and leaves an orphan portion of lot APN 259-

24 231-28, identified and named as "Lot 2-B," which is an unlawful and nonconforming parcel in

25 violation of law under both the SMA and under the EMC. Lot 2-B is not a separate legal parcel

26 because it has it been a part of, and been merged with APN 259-231-28, as a matter of law.

27 27. As alleged herein, it is unlawful for City to utilize a lot line adjustment that will

28 create or result in a non-compliant and nonconforming remnant parcel. The creation of such a

- 7-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

noncompliant remnant parcel must be made pursuant to a subdivision under Government Code

2 66424.6 - a formal SMA decision and action.

28. The creation of Lot 2-B further violates EMC § 24.70.010 because it creates one

4 or more conditions that do not comply with zoning and development regulations in the EMC

5 and does not comply with minimum City lot and parcel requirements.

6 29. For example, Lot 2-B does not comply with EMC § 30.16.010 which requires

7 that parcels in the R-30 Overlay zone must be large enough to accommodate a minimum of 16

8 multifamily units, or any other underlying zoning.

30. In addition to the above violations of law, the Planning Commission and City

10 Council failed to provide substantial evidence to support the Lot Consolidation that Lot 2-B

11 was a separate legal parcel, instead relying on unsupported statements of city staff at the

12 August 19, 2021 hearing, and City never demonstrating an evidentiary basis for City's decision

13 to approve the Lot Consolidation on said grounds.

14 31. Prior to Planning Commission's and City Council's final decisions, and

15 throughout the hearing and appeal process, ERRD presented a request for supporting evidence

16 that Lot 2-B was or was not a legal lot prior to City's Lot Consolidation.

17 32. City's response to ERRD's request, and documents eventually provided, did not

18 provide a basis of substantial evidence to support the Lot Consolidation. City appeared to rely

19 mainly on unsupported statements, a title report, a and reliance on a disqualifying city policy that

20 did not provide any corroboration that Lot 2-B was ever a separate legal parcel.

21 33. City incorrectly relies on its recent EMC amendment of Sections 24.70.010 to
22 24.70.110, adopted per Ordinance No. 2019-10, and City's policy for legal lot determinations,

23 to authorize the lot merger for the subject Lot Consolidation. However, based on existing

24 EMC requirements for qualifying and implementing lot line adjustments, the Lot Consolidation

25 does not qualify and should not have been approved.

26 34. Additionally, the above-referenced EMC amendment, that purports to allow

27 such lot mergers, is currently being challenged (as unlawfully adopted) in the civil lawsuit S.D.

28 Super. Ct., Case No. 2020-11962. In said lawsuit, ERRD challenges said provisions of the

- 8 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

EMC to authorize these types of lot mergers based on a claim a of unlawful compliance with

2 CEQA and defective public notice. It is expressly noticed and alleged herein that ERRD's

3 success in said lawsuit, resulting in the prayed-for relief of revocation and rescission of

4 Ordinance No. 2019-10, will cause and result in the Lot Consolidation being ruled and ordered

5 void ab initio.

6 35. A peremptory writ of mandamus is requested to be issued by this Court ordering

7 City to rescind Resolution 2021-95 and PC Resolution No. 2021-31 for City's failure to

8 comply with the SMA and EMC with regards to the Lot Consolidation approval.

V.

10 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION - PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

11 Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act

12 (Cal. Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq-; 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15000 et seq.)

13 36. Petitioner hereby re-alleges and incorporates by reference 11 1-35 above as

14 though fully set forth herein.

15 37. The Lot Consolidation constitutes a "project" as that term is defined under

16 CEQA pursuant to Public Resources Code § 21065. All potential and reasonably foreseeable

17 impacts a arising from a project, and the Project here, including its intended underlying housing

18 development, must be analyzed pursuant to CEQA and its regulations, including, but not

19 limited to, all environment and safety impacts, including fire evacuation, traffic and circulation,

20 and hazardous materials.

21 38. City has erroneously claimed an exemption pursuant to Government Code §

22 65583.2, subdivision (i). This claimed exemption is inapplicable because the Lot

23 Consolidation was not made in conjunction with the approval of a by-right project under

24 Government Code § 65583.2.

25 39. Additionally, City has erroneously claimed an exemption pursuant to CEQA

26 Guidelines § 15305 (Minor Alterations in Land Use Limitations). This exemption is not

27 applicable because the Lot Consolidation does not qualify as a "minor lot line adjustment," is

28 not a "reversion to acreage in accordance with the SMA," or an "issuance of minor

- 9-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

encroachment permit." The Lot Consolidation application and approval attempts to create a

2 remnant noncompliant and substandard legal parcel by segregation and creation of Lot 2-B.

3 40. By approving the Lot Consolidation and not complying with the requirement to

4 perform CEQA review, City has failed to proceed in a manner required by law and/or the

5 decision(s) and findings relating to City's purported CEQA compliance, via exemption, are not

6 supported by law or the substantial evidence. A peremptory writ of mandamus is requested to

7 be issued by this Court ordering City to rescind Resolution 2021-95 and PC Resolution No.

8 2021-31 and order City to comply with CEQA.

VI.

10 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION - DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

11 Lot Consolidation

12 41. ERRD hereby realleges and incorporates by reference 11 1-40 above, as though

13 fully set forth herein.

14 42. ERRD is beneficially interested in the issuance of one or more declarations of

15 law and injunctions by virtue of the propositions of facts and law set forth herein.

16 43. ERRD has clear, present and beneficial right to the proper performance by

17 City with respect to its interpretation, application, and implementation of the Subdivision Map

18 Act and the Encinitas Municipal Code. ERRD has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the

19 ordinary course of the law other than the relief herein sought.

20 44. The declaratory relief requested herein is proper to delineate and clarify the

21 parties' rights and liabilities and resolve, quiet, or stabilize an uncertain or disputed jural

22 relation. Without the grant of declaratory relief and/or the granting of an injunction, City will

23 continue to proceed in an unlawful manner, resulting in harm to ERRD, its individual

24 supporters, real parties in interest, and the citizenry of the Encinitas community for whom the

25 laws and community plans of the city are enacted to protect.

26 45. Specifically, City has unlawfully created a remnant parcel in the creation of Lot

27 2-B.

28

10 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

46. ERRD seeks a declaration of law that lots cannot be consolidated and create a

2 remnant lot via a lot line adjustment and instead must comply with the statutory requirements

3 of the Subdivision Map Act.

4 47. ERRD further seeks a declaration that the Lot Consolidation violates EMC §

5 24.70.010, because it creates a remnant parcel that does not comply with one or more zoning

6 and building codes of City.

7 48. ERRD requests a declaratory judgment and the issuance of an injunction to

8 enjoin and prevent any conduct or action of City to approve or act on any permit application for
the Lot Consolidation, or allow Real Parties to implement or act on any permit or approval,

10 until lawful compliance is achieved, as alleged and proven in the claims and counts set forth in

11 this action.

12 VII.

13 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION - DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

14 City's Interpretation of Provisions of State Housing Element Law and Density Bonus Law

15 (California Government Code §§ 65580-65589.11 and 65915-65918)

16 49. ERRD hereby realleges and incorporates by reference 11 1-48 above, as though

17 fully set forth herein.

18 50. ERRD is beneficially interested in the issuance of one or more declarations of

19 law and injunctions by virtue of the propositions of facts and law set forth herein.

20 51. ERRD has a clear, present and beneficial right to the proper performance by

21 City with respect to its interpretation, application, and implementation of the California

22 Housing Element and Density Bonus Law and related zoning requirements under the Encinitas

23 Municipal Code. ERRD has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the

24 law other than the relief herein sought.

25 52. The declaratory relief requested herein is proper to delineate and clarify the

26 parties' rights and liabilities and resolve, quiet, or stabilize an uncertain or disputed jural

27 relation. Without the grant of declaratory relief and the granting of an injunction, City will

28 continue to proceed in an unlawful manner, resulting in harm to ERRD, its individual

11 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

supporters, real parties in interest, and the citizenry of the Encinitas community for whom the

2 laws and community plans of the city are enacted to protect.

3 Count 1: City Misinterprets the 20% Affordable Housing Requirement for

4 By-Right Development

5 53. For an exemption from project-level CEQA review for the project and/or Lot

6 / Consolidation, respondent Real Party must qualify for a "by-right" development by ensuring

7 that 20% of all units must be affordable housing pursuant to Government Code § 65583.2,
subdivision (h). It is alleged herein that City incorrectly interprets said Code provision to mean
20% of the total of base density units, rather than 20% of the total number of all approved units

10 (including density bonus units) as specified in Government Code § 65583.2, subdivision (h).

11 Count 2: Prior Programmatic CEQA Mitigation Measures for an Identified Affordable
Housing Site Must be Implemented for By Right Development
12
54. State law requires that City's General Plan contain a housing element and that
13 the adoption of general plans and City's housing elements are subject to CEQA review.
14
55. City prepared a CEQA environmental assessment in association with the
15 adoption of its Fifth Cycle Housing Element amendment to its General Plan, and adopted
16 findings, conditions, and mitigation measures in association therewith. Mitigation measures
17 were identified in prior programmatic environmental review required as part of City's
18 Environmental Assessment to the Fifth Cycle Housing Element. Particular to the Encinitas
19 Blvd. Project site, City identified multiple impacts that required mitigation, including, but not
20 limited to, scenic road, scenic view corridor, and design review that control project bulk, mass,
21 height, architectural design, grading, and other visual factors. Other assessed impacts to other
22 sites were additionally identified and mitigation measures were required.
23
56. City failed to consider and apply such previously adopted CEQA conditions and
24 mitigation measures to the Encinitas Blvd. Project, and City has confirmed that it will continue
25 to refuse to apply previously adopted CEQA mitigation measures to any and all other by-right
26 affordable housing development projects under a legally defective claim of exemption. This
27 legal misinterpretation of Government Code § 65583.2, subd. (i) is an immediate and ongoing
28 controversy that needs to be resolved. To the contrary, said statutory provision exempts only
12 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

new project-level CEQA review for statutorily qualifying by-right projects. It does not exempt

2 or extinguish the imposition of prior programmatic conditions and mitigation measures.

3 Count 3: City Must Comply With Provisions of the Encinitas Municipal Code that Require

4 Base Density to Be Calculated Using Net Acreage

5 57. EMC § 30.16.010 requires City to calculate the base density of residential zones

6 utilizing net acreage.

58.
7 On April 7, 2021, City passed Resolution No. 2021-16 in the effort to

8 purportedly stop utilizing net acreage to calculate base density in residential zones.

59. However, the intended and future action language set forth in Resolution No.

10 2021-16 does not amend, repeal, or rescind EMC § 30.16.010. Further, City's decision to

11 ignore its own municipal code requirements is based on an erroneous reading of Government

12 § Code § 65915, subdivision (f). Government Code § 65915 subdivision (f) does not supersede

13 § EMC § 30.16.010 and does not mandate that base density for low income housing under

14 density bonus law is, and can only be, calculated using gross acreage.

15 60. City additionally fails to take into account the Hillside/Inland Bluff Overlay

16 Zone which reduces the total base density when determining the maximum bonus under density

17 bonus law for the inclusion of affordable housing in developments.

61.
18 City further counted and included as a portion of APN 259-231-32, the public

19 highway, Rancho Santa Fe Road. Rancho Santa Fe Road should not be considered as part of

20 any gross or any usable acreage because its conversion and acceptance as a public highway has

21 extinguished any ancillary or tangible property rights, or, in the alternative, any remaining

22 property rights are so diminished such that including the road acreage into either gross or net

23 acreage is not supported.

24 62. City has failed, as a matter of law, to correctly interpret its Zoning Code,

25 applicable overlay zones, and unusable acreage in calculating base density, therefore causing,

26 and which will continue to cause, City to misinterpret the maximum allowable density when

27 calculating density bonuses for affordable housing developments.

63. The above Counts 1 through 3 state an actual controversy between ERRD and

2 City, and Real Party, in regards to the correct interpretation of state law and Encinitas

3 Municipal Code as stated in Paragraphs 53-62.

4 64. The dispute of statutory interpretation and controversy is ripe as to the Encinitas

5 Blvd. Project because: (1) Real Party or others are poised to file a lawsuit to rescind City's

6 denial of the Encinitas Blvd. Project and/or, alternatively, Real Party will reapply to develop

7 the Encinitas Blvd. Project site; and (2) City's Sixth Cycle Housing Element identifies 17

8 project sites for affordable housing that, when developed, are likely to be incorrectly processed
as a by-right affordable housing development based on City's misinterpretation of

10 Government Code § 65583.2, subdivisions (i) and (h). Thus, the issues of statutory

11 interpretation raised here will be repeated and cause a multiplicity of lawsuits unless one or

12 more declarations of law settles these disputed statutory interpretation issues.

13 VIIL.

14 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

15 WHEREFORE, ERRD respectfully prays for judgment as follows:

16 1. That this Court find that respondent and defendant City of Encinitas, by

17 approving the Lot Consolidation on August 19, 2021, and upholding the Lot Consolidation on

18 November 10, 2021, failed to proceed in a manner required by law, has unlawfully and

19 incorrectly applied CEQA exemptions to the Project, and that City has failed to make findings

20 and determinations supported by substantial evidence to support approval of the Lot

21 Consolidation;

22 2. That this Court issue a peremptory writ of mandamus declaring that City

23 Council's denial of ERRD's appeal on November 10, 2021 via Resolution 2021-95 and PC

24 Resolution No. 2021-31, approved by City's Planning Commission on August 19, 2021, be

25 rendered null and void and have no legal force or effect, including any future or dependent

26 action relying thereon;

27 3. That until such time as ERRD's above claims can be adjudicated by this Court,

28 City and Real Party in Interest, be enjoined, restrained, and stayed from implementing the Lot

Consolidation so as to preserve the status quo and prevent frustration of ERRD's and the

2 public's rightful claim and right to judicial review;

4. That this Court issue one or more declarations of law interpreting Housing

4 Element Law, Density Bonus Law, and provisions of the Encinitas Municipal Code as follows:

5 (a) Government Code § 65583.2, subdivision (h) requires 20% of the total number of

6 approved or proposed units be affordable housing for a development to qualify as an exempt or

7 exemptible "by-right" development;
(b) Government Code § 65583.2, subd. (i) does not exempt a by-right project from the
implementation of CEQA conditions and mitigation measures determined and adopted in a

10 prior programmatic environmental, made via state law and during review of a mandated

11 Housing Element amendment to City's general plan;

12 (c) EMC § 30.16.010 requires City to calculate the base density of residential zones

13 utilizing net acreage, Government Code § 65915 subdivision (f) does not supersede EMC §

14 30.16.010, and does not mandate that base density for low income housing under density bonus

15 law can only be calculated using gross acreage, and City must take into account reductions

16 from the Hillside/Inland Bluff Overlay Zone and public highways when determining the

17 maximum bonus under density bonus law for the inclusion of affordable housing in

18 developments.

19 5. That ERRD be awarded its reasonable costs incurred in this action, including

20 but not limited to attorneys' fees under Cal. Code § of Civil Procedure $ 1021.5 for this matter

21 brought in the public interest; and

22 6. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Re: Re: NOTICE OF FILING CEQA LAWSUIT
Encinitas Residents for Responsible Development v. City of Encinitas, et al.
San Diego County Superior Court, Case No. 37-2022-0003664-CU-WM-NC

Dear Mr. Bonta:

NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN pursuant to California Public Resources Code § 21167.5 and Code
of Civil Procedure § 388 that petitioner Encinitas Residents for Responsible Development ("Petitioner"), a not-for-profit public benefit entity within the City of Encinitas, has filed a lawsuit
as a petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief against respondent CITY OF ENCINITAS ("City") and real party in interest applicant/developer Encinitas Blvd Apartments 6.95 LP. Petitioner's lawsuit includes claims for violation of the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Petitioner challenges the November 10, 2021 final decision of City, made via Resolution 2021-95, to approve a boundary adjustment to consolidate lots (and create a non-compliant remnant lot) of the properties for the above-referenced Project. Petitioner brought the lawsuit because of City's improper use of CEQA exemptions, and City's failure to
perform required CEQA review, analyses, or findings for the boundary adjustment for the Project. Petitioner also challenges the approval of the boundary adjustment because it violates the Subdivision Map Act and the Encinitas Municipal Code. The filed lawsuit also seeks declaratory
and injunctive relief, related to City's interpretation of state housing statutes, including the applicability of prior CEQA programmatic review, and as those laws apply to the Project and
provisions of State Housing Element Law and Density Bonus Law (California Government Code
§§ 65580-65589.11 and 65915-65918).

Should the Attorney General's Office have any interest or specific questions regarding this
lawsuit, please contact my office.

Sincerely,
aut
Craig A. Sherman
