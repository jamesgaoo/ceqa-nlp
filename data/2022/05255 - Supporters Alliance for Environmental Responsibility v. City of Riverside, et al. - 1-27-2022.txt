3 (*SAFER" or "Petitioner") petitions this Court, on its own behalf, on behalf of its members, on behalf of

4 the general public and in the public interest pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure ("CCP") § 1085 and

5 Public Resources Code ("PRC") § 21168.5, or, in the alternative, pursuant to CCP § 1094.5 and PRC

6 21168, for a Writ of Mandate directed to Respondents CITY OF RIVERSIDE, RIVERSIDE CITY

8 in Interest GREENS EHRENBERG, LLC, GREENS (EHRENBERG), L.L.C., GREENS GROUP, INC.,

9 GREENS DEVELOPMENT, INC, GREENS INV 10, LLC, and OVERLAND DEVELOPMENT

10 COMPANY ("Real Parties" or "Applicant"). By this verified petition ("Petition"), Petitioner alleges as

follows:

11 INTRODUCTION

12 1.

13 Petitioner brings this action to challenge the unlawful actions of Respondents in

14 exempting the AC Marriot - Residence Inn Downtown Riverside Project (*Project") from environmental

15 review under to the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.

16 ("CEQA") pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15331 ("Historical Rehabilitation Exemption") and

17 section 15332 ("Infill Exemption"), and in granting a variance for the Project to encroach 14 feet into
the required 15-foot setback.

18 2.

19 The Project site is located within two historical districts: the Mission Inn District and the
Seventh Street District. The Project site is in the immediate vicinity of seven historical structures,
20 | including the First Congregational Church Parsonage, First Congregational Church, Universalist

21

22 Unitarian Church, Municipal Auditorium, Riverside Art Museum (originally YWCA), and Arlington
Heights Citrus Exchange.

23 3.

24 The Project proposes the demolition of an existing surface parking lot on the north

25 western portion of the site and the retention of the vacant historic Central Fire Station to facilitate

26 construction of an eight-story, 226-room hotel with three-level subterranean parking garage.

4.

27 At over 93-feet, the Project will tower over the historic buildings in the vicinity. Multiple

28 historical experts determined that the Project would undoubtably result in significant impacts to nearby
historical resources. CEQA prohibits exemptions where a project may result in significant impacts to

2

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

- historical resources.

2 5.

3 The Project is inconsistent with applicable zoning requirements as well as numerous

4 policies and objectives of the City's General Plan and Downtown Specific Plan. CEQA prohibits

5 exemptions where a project is inconsistent with all applicable general plan policies as well as with
applicable zoning designation and regulations.

6 6.

7 In addition, expert evidence demonstrated that the Project will result in significant

8 impacts to air quality and noise. The City even implicitly acknowledged the Project's significant noise

9 impacts by requiring non-impact pile driving during construction to reduce the Project's impacts to less-

10 than-significant. CEQA prohibits application of the Infill Exemption where a project will result in
significant impacts to air quality and noise.

11 7.

12 In granting a variance for the Project's setbacks, the City failed to demonstrate that the

13 strict application of the zoning ordinance would deprive the Project of privileges enjoyed by other

14 property in the vicinity and under identical zoning classification due to special circumstances applicable
to the Project site. There is nothing unique about the Project site compared to other properties that
15 justified the City's granting of the variance.

16 8.

17 In consideration of the proceeding paragraphs, Petitioner respectfully requests that the

18 Court direct Respondents to set aside any and all approvals related to the Project, including the Project's

19 exemption from CEQA review pursuant to CEQA Guidelines sections 15331 and 15332 and the
variance from setback requirements.

20 PARTIES

21 9.

22 Petitioner SAFER is a California nonprofit public benefit corporation with members who

23 live and/or work in or near the City of Riverside. The primary objective and purpose of SAFER is to

24 contribute to the preservation and enhancement of the environment; to advocate for programs, policies,

25 and development projects that promote not only good jobs but also a healthy natural environment and

26 working environment, including but not limited to advocating for changes to proposed projects and

27 policies that, if adopted, would reduce air, soil and water pollution, minimize harm to wildlife, conserve

28 wild places, reduce traffic congestion, reduce global warming impacts, and assure compliance with
applicable land use ordinances; to work to attain the widest range of beneficial uses of the environment

3

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

-

2 without degradation, risk to health or safety, or other undesirable and unintended consequences; to

3 promote environmentally sustainable businesses and development projects, including providing

4 comments raising environmental concerns and benefits on proposed development projects; to advocate

5 for changes to proposed development projects that will help to achieve a balance between employment,

6 the human population, and resource use which will permit high standards of living and a wide sharing of

7 life's amenities by the general public; to take steps to preserve important historic, cultural, and natural

8 aspects of our national heritage, and maintain, wherever possible, an environment which supports
diversity and variety of individual choice; and to carry on other charitable and educational activities

9 associated with this goal as allowed by law.

10 10.

11 SAFER's members who live and/or work near the Project have several legally cognizable

12 interests in the Project and will be negatively affected by the Project's adverse environmental impacts

13 and improper approval. The interests of Petitioner and its members are unique and will be directly

14 impacted by the Project. Petitioner brings this action on behalf of itself, their members, and in the public

15 interest. Petitioner and its members have a direct and beneficial interest in Respondents' compliance

16 with laws bearing upon approval of the Project. These interests will be directly and adversely affected

17 by the Project, which violates provisions of law as set forth in this Petition and would cause substantial

18 harm to the natural environment and the quality of life in the surrounding community. The maintenance

19 and prosecution of this action will confer a substantial benefit on the public by protecting the public
from the procedural, environmental, and other harms alleged herein.

20 11.

21 Respondent CITY OF RIVERSIDE is the "lead agency" for the Project for purposes of

22 Public Resources Code § 21067, and has principal responsibility for conducting environmental review

23 for the Project and taking other actions necessary to comply with CEQA. CITY OF RIVERSIDE is

24 named as the "Public Agency Approving Project" on the City's Notice of Exemption.
12.

25 Respondent CITY OF RIVERSIDE CITY COUNCIL (*City Council") serves as the

26 City's decision-making body. As the decision-making body for the City, the City Council is ultimately

27 responsible for reviewing and approving or denying the Project. The City Council voted to approve the

28 Project, grant a variance from setback requirements, and exempt the Project from CEQA on November
16, 2021.

6 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7 30. The Project site is located at the southeast corner of Lemon Street and Mission Inn

8

9 Avenue, and at the southwest corner of Lime Street and Mission Inn Avenue in the City of Riverside,

10 CA at APNs 213-281-006, 213-281-007 and 213-281-009. The Project Site .2 located within the

11 Downtown Specific Plan - Raincross District and is also located in the Mission Inn Historic District

and Seventh Street Historic District.

12 31.

13 The Project proposes the demolition of an existing surface parking lot on the north
western portion of the site and the retention of the vacant historic Central Fire Station to facilitate

14

15 construction of an eight-story, 226-room hotel with a three-level subterranean parking garage, totaling
215,350 square-feet (SF).

16 32.

17 The Project also proposes minor exterior improvements to the Central Fire Station, which

would be used as office space.

18 33.

19 The Project site is directly or diagonally across the street from seven historical buildings, all

20 but one of which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places ("NRHP") and the California

21 Register of Historical Resources ("CRHR"), including First Congregational Church Parsonage, First

22 Congregational Church, Universalist Unitarian Church, Municipal Auditorium, Riverside Art Museum

23 (originally YWCA), Arlington Heights Citrus Exchange. All of the buildings are designated as Riverside
City Landmarks ("RCL").

24 34.

25 The Mission Inn Historic District (1871-1946) is the old downtown core and is

26 comprised primarily of commercial and government buildings. It encompasses part of the Seventh

27 Street Historic District and is distinctive for its embodiment of the Mission Revival style. Other styles

28 include Spanish Colonial Revival and Art Deco with a variety of building materials such as ceramic
brick, terra cotta and rough-hewn granite. The district features numerous resources listed in the

7

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

- National Register of Historic Places, including the historic Mission Inn itself.

2 35.

3 The Seventh Street Historic District (1889-1945) includes a grouping of some of

4 Riverside's finest commercial and residential architecture, as well as the historic citrus tree pergolas,
Raincross streetlights, and the Buena Vista Bridge.
5 36.

6 The Project required Conditional Use Permit to exceed the applicable 3.0 floor area
ratio (*FAR") and 60-foot height limitations.
7 37.

8 The Project initially required two variances: (1) To allow the proposed hotel building to
encroach 14 feet into the required 15-foot front yard setback along Mission Inn Avenue ("Setback

9

10 Variance" and (2) To allow 144 parking spaces to serve the hotel use, where 226 parking spaces are

11 required by the Code. Due to modifications of the Project during the administrative process, the
Applicant requested only the Setback Variance from the City Council.
12 38.

13 On or about April 9, 2021, the City posted the Agenda for the Planning Commission's

14 April 15, 2021 meeting, at which the Commission would consider the Project, the conditional use
permit, variances, and exemption from CEQA pursuant to the Infill Exemption.
15 39.

16 On or about April 9, 2021, the City posted a report prepared by the Applicant's

17 environmental consultants titled "Class 32 Infill Streamlining Checklist." The report included multiple

18 appendices including a "Historic Resource Evaluation Assessment Report" prepared by George Taylor

19 Louden (*Louden Report"), an "Air Quality and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Impact Analysis" prepared

20 by Vista Environmental, and a "Noise & Vibration Impact Analysis" prepared by Urban Crossroads.

40. On April 14, 2021, Petitioner submitted a written comment letter to

21 the Planning
Commission ("April 14 Comment").

22 41.

23 The April 14 Comment noted that the Project did not qualify for the Infill Exemption

24 due to inconsistencies with applicable zoning and General Plan policies as evidenced by the
conditional use permit and variances. necessary

25 42.

26 The April 14 Comment included the comments of indoor air quality expert, Francis

27 "Bud" Offermann, P.E. ("Mr. Offermann"). Mr. Offermann noted that formaldehyde off-gassing from

28 composite wood building materials were likely to create a cancer risk of 112 per million for future
residents of the Project. Mr. Offermann concluded that the Project would have significant human health

8

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

- impacts due to formaldehyde emissions.

2 43. The April 14 Comment noted that the Project could not qualify for an exemption
3 because it "may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of an historical resource." (See

4 Pub. Res. Code, § 21084(e).)

5 44. The April 14 Comment noted that the Project did not qualify for its requested variances

6

7 because: (1) There are no exceptional or extraordinary circumstances applying to the Project site that do
not apply generally to other properties or uses in the same class of district; (2) There are no exceptional

8 or extraordinary circumstances, under which the literal enforcement of the Code would result in

9 practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship not created by or attributable to the applicant or the owner

10

11 of the property; (3) The variance is not necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial

12 property right, possessed by other property in the same class of district. The variance is not necessary

13 for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right, possessed by other property in the

14 same class of district; (4) The granting of the variance will be materially detrimental to the public

15 welfare or materially injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity; and (5) The granting of

16 the variance will not be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the Planning Code and will
adversely affect the City's General Plan.

17 45.

18 On April 15, 2021, the Planning Commission held a public meeting and voted to exempt

19 the Project from CEQA pursuant to the Infill Exemption and to approve the Conditional Use Permit
(P19-0560), Setback Variance (P19-0561), and Parking Variance (P19-0562).
20 46.

21 On April 22, 2021, Petitioner timely filed an appeal of the Planning Commission's
decision to the City Council.

22 47.

23 On or about April 16, 2021, the City posted the Agenda for the City of Riverside

24 Cultural Heritage Board's April 21, 2021 meeting, at which the Board would consider the Project, a

25 Certificate of Appropriateness (see Riverside Municipal Code § 20.25.050), and exemptions from
CEQA pursuant to the Infill Exemption and Historical Restoration Exemption.
26 48.

27 On April 20, 2021, Petitioner submitted & written comment to the Cultural Heritage

28 Board, which reiterated the same points made in Petitioner's April 15 Comment to the Planning
Commission.

9

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

L 49.

2 On April 21, 2021, the Cultural Heritage Board voted to deny the Certificate of

3 Appropriateness and the exemptions from CEQA pursuant to the Infill Exemption and Historical

4 Restoration Exemption. As the City's expert agency on historic resources, the Cultural Heritage Board

5 found that the Project would have adverse impacts on historic resources, and that the CEQA Infill
Exemption and Historical Restoration Exemption were inappropriate.

6 50.

7 City Council. The Applicant timely filed an appeal of the Cultural Heritage Board's decision to the

8 51.

9 On or about July 9, 2021, the City posted the Agenda for the City Council's Land Use,

10 Sustainability, and Resilience Committee's July 12, 2021 meeting, at which the Committee would
consider the Applicant's appeal of the Cultural Heritage Board decision.

11 52.

12 On July 9, 2021, the First Congregational Church of Riverside submitted a written

13 comment to the Land Use, Sustainability, and Resilience Committee (*First Congregational
Comment").

14 53. The First Congregational Comment included an analysis of the Project by GPA
15 Consulting, a firm specializing in historic preservation and rehabilitation ("GPA Report").
16 54.

17 The GPA Report concluded that the Project would, or could without mitigation, fail to

18 meet several of the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties with

19 Guidelines for Preserving, Rehabilitating, Restoring, and Reconstructing Historic Buildings ("SOI

20 Standards") and, therefore, did not qualify for the Historical Rehabilitation Exemption.

55.

21 The GPA Report noted that the Louden Report "did not adequately address what the

22 character-defining-features of the two historic districts were and whether the new infill development
was compatible with the surrounding setting of those two historic districts."

23 56.

24 The First Congregational Comment noted that the Project was inconsistent with the

25 policies and objectives of the City's General Plan, including Policy HP-1.5 (The City shall promote

26 neighborhood/city identity and the role of historic preservation in community enhancement), Policy

27 HP-5. (The City shall use its design and plot plan review processes to encourage new construction to be

28 compatible in scale and character with cultural resources and historic districts), and Objective LU-48
(Strengthen the identity and character of Downtown using the existing historic and architectural urban

10

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

-

2 character of the community, while allowing for new structures that are architecturally compatible with
and complementary to the existing architectural and historic fabric).

3 57.

4 The First Congregational Comment noted that the Project's 1-ft setbacks were

5 inconsistent with the 15-ft setbacks required by the Downtown Specific Plan.
58.

6 The First Congregational Comment noted the Project was inconsistent with the policies

7 of the Downtown Specific Plan, including Policy LU 1.1, which requires infill development in the

8 Raincross District to be "compatible with the historic structures that give Downtown its unique
identity."

9 59.

10 The First Congregational Comment noted that there is already significant traffic

11 congestion on and around Mission Inn Avenue and that the Project would exacerbate those conditions.

60.

12 The First Congregational Comment noted that there would be cumulative impacts to the

13 Mission Inn Historic District due to the recent development of two seven-story buildings in the District,
Stadler Plaza and Imperial Hardware Lofts.

14 61.

15 The First Congregational Comment noted that, due to the Project's incompatibility with

16 the surrounding Mission Inn Historic District, its adverse impacts on views of the character-defining

17 First Congregational Church bell tower, and its inconsistencies with the SOI Standards, the City could

18 not make the requisite findings to grant a Certificate of Appropriateness under Riverside Municipal
Code section 20.25.050.

19 62. On July 11, 2021, Petitioner submitted a written comment to the Land Use,
20 Sustainability, and Resilience Committee ("July 11 Comment").
21 63.

22 The July 11 Comment included an analysis of the Project by expert architectural
historian Michael R. Corbett.

23 64.

24 Mr. Corbett concluded that, due to its massing, size, and scale, the Project was
inconsistent with Standard Number 9 of the SOI Standards.

25 65. Mr. Corbett noted that the Louden Report failed to adequately assess the Project's
26 consistency with the SOI Standards as well as the Project's cumulative impact on historic resources.
27 66.

28 Mr. Corbett noted that further studies were needed to determine the character defining
features of the surrounding historical buildings.

F 67.

2 On July 12, 2021, the Land Use, Sustainability, and Resilience Committee voted to

3 recommend that the City Council grant the Applicant's appeal of the Cultural Heritage Board decision,

4 grant the Certificate of Appropriateness, and determine that the Project is exempt from CEQA pursuant
to the Infill Exemption and Historical Restoration Exemption.

5 68.

6 On or about August 13, 2021, the City posted the agenda for the City Council's August

7 17, 2021 meeting, at which it would consider: (1) the recommendation of the Land Use, Sustainability,

8 and Resilience Committee to grant the Applicant's appeal of the Cultural Heritage Board's decision

9 denying the Certificate of Appropriateness and exemption from CEQA pursuant to the Infill Exemption

10 and Historic Rehabilitation Exemption; and (2) Petitioner's appeal of the Planning Commission's

11 decision approving the conditional use permit, variances, and exemption from CEQA pursuant to the
Infill Exemption.

12 69.

13 On August 16, 2021, Petitioner submitted a written comment to the City Council
(*August 16 Comment").

14 70. The August 16 Comment included an
15 analysis of the Project by air quality experts Paul

16 E. Rosenfeld, Ph.D. and Matt Hagemann, P.G., C.Hg. of environmental consulting firm, Soil/Water/Air
Protection Enterprise ("SWAPE").

17 71. SWAPE noted that the air quality analysis provided by the Applicant's consultants
18 underestimated the Project's emissions of criteria air pollutants.
19 72. SWAPE concluded that construction of the Project would result in 324.65 pounds per
20 day of volatile organic compounds ("VOC"), far in excess of the 75 pounds per day CEQA significance
21

22 threshold for VOC established by the South Coast Air Quality Management District ("SCAQMD").
73.

23 SWAPE concluded that construction of the Project would result in 176.95 pounds per

24 day of nitrogen oxides ("NOx"), in excess of the 100 pounds per day CEQA significance threshold for
NOx established by SCAQMD.
25 74.

26 SWAPE concluded that emissions of diesel particulate matter ("DPM") during

27 construction and operation of the Project would result in an excess cancer risk for children and infants,

28 at the closest sensitive receptor located approximately 100 meters away, of approximately 47 and 43 in
one million, in excess of the SCAQMD CEQA significance threshold of 10 in one million.

F 75.

2 The August 16 Comment included an analysis of the Project by noise expert Deborah A.
Jue of the consulting firm Wilson Ihrig.

3 76.

4 Wilson Ihrig concluded that the Project's noise analysis: (1) failed to utilize proper

5 metrics and failed to clearly establish existing baseline conditions to compare the Project's noise

6 impacts to the City's General Plan; (2) failed to address the Project's permanent increase in ambient

7 noise; (3) improperly relied on data from "similar projects" instead of conducting an analysis in

8 accordance with Caltrans, Federal Transit Administration ("FTA") and Federal Highway

9 Administration ("FHWA") guidance; and (4) failed to include noise and vibration impacts of
impact/driven piles.

10 77.

11 Wilson Ihrig found that, using the recommended methodology from Caltrans and FTA,

12 "there would be noise impact (> 80 dBA Leq) at the Life Arts Center and the Congregational Church,

13 and if any concrete trucks or cranes are staged on Lincoln Street, the noise impacts at the Church would
be greater."

14 78.

15 Wilson Ihrig concluded that, without an express condition prohibiting pile driving, the

16 Project would result in significant noise impacts that had not been disclosed. If pile driving were

17 allowed to occur, the noise would exceed significance thresholds and disqualify the Project from
CEQA's Infill Exemption.

18 79.

19 On August 16, 2021, the Mission Inn Hotel & Spa and Mission District Associates, LLC
submitted a written comment to the City Council ("Mission Inn Comment").

20 80.

21 The Mission Inn Comment noted that the Project did not qualify for the Infill Exemption

22 because, as evidence by the requested variances, the Project is not consistent with applicable setback
requirements.

23 81.

24 The Mission Inn Comment included an analysis of the Project by Nicole Criste of Terra
Nova Planning and Research, Inc. ("Terra Nova").

25 82.

26 Terra Nova noted that the City's analysis of the Project concluded that the Project would

27 result in traffic impacts associated with construction, but that this impact would be temporary and,

28 therefore, less than significant. However, the City provided no evidence of how the impact would be
less than significant.

13

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

- 83.

2 Terra Nova noted that the Project's noise analysis claimed that "non-impact pile driving

3 equipment" would be required, which disqualifies the Project from an exemption under CEQA due to
the prohibition on mitigated exemptions.

4 84. The Mission Inn Comment included an analysis of the Project by expert historic
5 preservationist Jenna Snow.

6 85.

7 Ms. Snow concluded that the Project bore no relationship to the mass, scale and
proportions of the buildings within its immediate vicinity.

8 86. Ms. Snow concluded that the Louden Report failed to adequately consider the Project's
impacts to historical resources, including direct impacts to the Central Fire Station, vibration impacts to

10

11 the Central Fire Station and YMCA, and indirect impacts to the surrounding historical district due to
the Project's size, massing, and scale.

12 87.

13 Ms. Snow noted that the Louden Report concluded that there would be no impacts yet

14 recommended a mitigation program, indicating that the Project does not conform with SOI Standards
and would result in a significant impact on historical resources.

15 88. Ms. Snow noted that the Louden Report improperly dismissed all interior character-
16 defining features of the Central Fire Station, which are part of its California Register listing and convey
17 its significance as an International style fire station.

18 89.

19 Ms. Snow concluded that the Project would adversely impact the setting of both historic

20 districts and the visual relationships between historic buildings surrounding the Project site.
90.

21 The Mission Inn Comment noted that the City had improperly deferred an assessment of
the Project's impacts to the interior of the Central Fire Station.

22 91.

23 The Mission Inn Comment noted that presence of the historic Central Fire Station on the

24 Project site as well as the surrounding historical resources constituted "unusual circumstances" which

25 differentiated the Project from other infill developments that may fall within the Infill Exemption.
92.

26 The Mission Inn Comment noted that the Project did not qualify for an exemption from

27 CEQA because of proposed mitigation for the Project's impacts to noise and historical resources.
93.

28 The Mission Inn Comment noted that the Project did not qualify for variances because
the size, shape, topography, location, and surroundings of the Project site do not vary substantially from

14

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

those of other parcels in the same zoning district or vicinity such that special circumstances exist.

2 94. The Mission Inn Comment noted that to the extent that the variance findings required by
3 the City's Zoning Code are more lenient than those required by the State Planning & Zoning Law, they
4 are preempted and invalid.

5 95. The Mission Inn Comment noted that the loss of hotel rooms was not adequate

6 justification for granting the Setback Variance.

7 96. The Mission Inn Comment noted that the requested variances for the Project would grant
8 the Applicant special privileges that are inconsistent with the restrictions placed on other parcels in the

9 same zoning district or vicinity, in violation of state law.

10 97. The Mission Inn Comment noted that there was no evidence to support the necessary
11 findings for the Project's Conditional Use Permit.

12 98. The Mission Inn Comment noted that the City could not lawfully use a conditional use
13 permit to grant variances from height or floor area ratio requirements.
14 99. The Mission Inn Comment noted that the City's Findings for the Conditional Use Permit
15 did not address the height or floor area ratio exceptions being sought for the Project.
16 100. The Mission Inn Comment noted that the Project was inconsistent with numerous
17 objectives and policies of the City's General Plan related to land use, circulation, noise, and historic
18 preservation.

19 101. The Mission Inn Comment noted that the Project was inconsistent with numerous
20 objectives and policies of the City's Downtown Specific Plan.

21 102. On August 17, 2021, the City Council voted to continue consideration of the Project to a
22 date uncertain.

23 103. On or about November 12, 2021, the City posted the agenda for the City Council's
24 November 16, 2021 meeting, at which it would consider: (1) the recommendation of the Land Use,
25 Sustainability, and Resilience Committee to grant the Applicant's appeal of the Cultural Heritage
26 Board's decision denying the Certificate of Appropriateness and exemption from CEQA pursuant to the
27 Infill Exemption and Historic Rehabilitation Exemption; and (2) Petitioner's appeal of the Planning
28 Commission's decision approving the conditional use permit, variances, and exemption from CEQA

15

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

- pursuant to the Infill Exemption.

2 104.

3 On November 15, 2021, Petitioner submitted a written comment to the City Council
("November 15 Comment").

4 105.

5 The November 15 Comment included an additional analysis by expert architectural

6 historian Michael R. Corbett in response to the supplemental historical analysis provided by the
Applicant's consultant (*Supplemental Louden Report").

7 106.

8 Mr. Corbett noted that the Supplemental Louden Report did not cure the deficiencies of
the original Louden Report.

9 107.

10 Mr. Corbett concluded that the Supplemental Louden Report failed to show how the

11 Project is consistent with SOI Standard Number 9, which requires that the Project "shall be compatible

12 with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property
and its environment."

13 108.

14 Mr. Corbett noted that the Supplemental Louden Report improperly relied on a

15 comparison of the Project to two recent development projects in Riverside (Stadler Plaza and Imperial
Hardware Lofts) to determine consistency with the SOI Standards.

16 109.

17 Mr. Corbett critiqued the Supplemental Louden Report for claiming that the height of

18 the Project is comparable to that of the First Congregational Church and the Riverside Municipal
Auditorium.

19 110.

20 The November 15 Comment noted that every historical consultant who had looked at

21 this Project (except for the Applicant's) had concluded that the Project cannot be exempt from CEQA
review due to its impacts on historical resources and inconsistencies with the SOI Standards.

22 111.

23 On November 17, 2021, the City Council voted 5-2 to grant the Applicant's appeal and

24 deny Petitioner's appeal, thereby approving the Certificate of Appropriateness, Conditional Use Permit,

25 and Setback Variance, and exempting the Project from CEQA review pursuant to the Infill Exemption
and Historical Rehabilitation Exemption.

26 112.

27 On November 18, 2021, the City filed a Notice of Exemption with the Riverside County

28 Clerk, noticing exemption of the Project from CEQA review pursuant to the Infill Exemption and
Historical Rehabilitation Exemption. This Petition is filed within 35-days of the Notice of Exemption.

16

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

- LEGAL BACKGROUND

2 The California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA")

3 113.

4 CEQA mandates that "the long-term protection of the environment. . . shall be the

5 guiding criterion in public decisions" throughout California. (PRC §21001(d).) CEQA requires
environmental factors to be considered at the "earliest stage .

6 before [the project] gains irreversible

7 momentum" (Bozung V. LAFCO (1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 284 n.28), "at a point in the planning process

8 where genuine flexibility remains." (Sundstrom v. County of Mendocino (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 296,

9 307 [internal quotation marks and citation omitted].) Moreover, "the 'foremost principle' in interpreting

10 CEQA .A that the Legislature intended the act to be read so as to afford the fullest possible protection to

11 the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language." (Communities for a Better
Env't v. Cal. Resources Agency (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98, 109.)

12 114.

13 To achieve its objectives of environmental protection, CEQA has a three-tiered

14 structure. (14 CCR § 15002(k); Committee to Save the Hollywoodland Specific Plan V. City of Los

15 Angeles (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1168, 1185-86.) First, if a project falls into an exempt category, or it
can be seen with certainty that the activity in question will not have a significant effect on the
16 environment, no further agency evaluation is required. (Id.) Second, if there is a possibility the project
17

18 will have a significant effect on the environment, the agency must perform an initial threshold study.
(Id.; 14 CCR § 15063(a).) If the study indicates that there is no substantial evidence that the
19 project or
any of its aspects may cause a significant effect on the environment the agency may issue a negative
20 declaration. (Id.; 14 CCR §§ 15063(b)(2), 15070.) Finally, if the project will have a significant effect on
21

22 the environment, an environmental impact report ("EIR") is required. (Id.)
115. CEQA identifies certain classes of projects which
23 are exempt from the provisions of
CEQA. These are called categorical exemptions. (14 CCR §§ 15300, 15354.)
24 116.

25 Pursuant to CEQA's Infill exemption, project is exempt from CEQA review where
"(a) The project is consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable general
26 plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and regulations. (b) The proposed
27

28 development occurs within city limits on a project site of no more than five acres substantially
surrounded by urban uses. (c) The project site has no value, as habitat for endangered, rare or

17

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

-

2 threatened species. (d) Approval of the project would not result in any significant effects relating to

3 traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality. (e) The site can be adequately served by all required utilities
and public services.' (14 CCR § 15332.)

4 117. CEQA's Historical Rehabilitation and Restoration Exemption is "limited to
5 maintenance, repair, stabilization, rehabilitation, restoration, preservation, conservation or

6 reconstruction of historical resources in a manner consistent with the

7 Secretary of the Interior's

8 Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties with Guidelines for Preserving, Rehabilitating,
Restoring, and Reconstructing Historic Buildings." (14 CCR § 15331.)

9 118.

10 CEQA expressly prohibits exemptions where a project "may cause a substantial adverse

11 change in the significance of an historical resource." (Pub. Res. Code, § 21084(e) [emphasis added].) A

12 substantial adverse change is defined as the "physical demolition, destruction, relocation, or alteration

13 of the resource or its immediate surroundings such that the significance of an historical resource would

14 be materially impaired." (14 CCR § 15064.5(b)(1).) Impacts to historical resources are "generally" not

15 considered significant if a project is found to comply with the SOI Standards. (14 CCR §
15064.5(b)(3).)

16 119.

17 CEQA expressly prohibits exemptions where a project may have significant impacts due
to unusual circumstances. (14 CCR § 15300.2(c).)
18 120.

19 A Project cannot be exempt from CEQA if it requires mitigation measures to reduce its
impacts to a less-than-significant level. (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network County of Marin
20 (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1102; Azusa Land Recl. Co. y Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster

21 (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1165, 1200.)

22 Variances

23 121.

24 "Variances from the terms of the zoning ordinances shall be granted only when, because

25 of special circumstances applicable to the property, including size, shape, topography, location or

26 surroundings, the strict application of the zoning ordinance deprives such property of privileges

27 enjoyed by other property in the vicinity and under identical zoning classification." (Gov. Code, §
65906.)

28 122. "[D]ata focusing on the qualities of the property and the project for which the variance is

18

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

sought, the desirability of the proposed development, the attractiveness of its design, the benefits to the

2 community, or the economic difficulties of developing the property in conformance with the zoning

3 regulations, lack legal significance and are simply irrelevant to the controlling issue of whether strict

4 application of zoning laws would prevent the would-be developer from utilizing his or her property to

5 the same extent as other property owners in the same zoning district." (Orinda Assn. V. Board of

6 Supervisors (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 1145, 1148.)

7 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

8 Violation of CEQA - Improper Exemption
9 (Public Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.) (Code of Civil Procedure § 1085 or in the alternative §1094.5)
10 123. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs, in
11 their entirety, as if fully set forth herein.
12 124. Respondents improperly exempted the Project from environmental review pursuant to
13 CEQA because exemptions are prohibited where mitigation measures are necessary to reduce a
14 project's impacts to a less-than-significant level. The Project requires mitigation to reduce its impacts to
15 noise and historical resources and, therefore, Respondents abused their discretion and failed to proceed
16 in a manner required by law by exempting the Project from CEQA review.
17 125. Respondents improperly exempted the Project from environmental review pursuant to
18 CEQA because exemptions are prohibited where a project "a project "may cause a substantial adverse a
19 change in the significance of an historical resource." Expert evidence demonstrated that the Project may
20 result in significant impacts to historical resources and, therefore, Respondents abused their discretion
21 and failed to proceed in a manner required by law by exempting the Project from CEQA review.
22 126. Respondents improperly exempted the Project from environmental review pursuant to
23 CEQA because the Project may have significant adverse environmental impacts due to unusual
24 circumstances, including, but not limited to, air quality impacts, noise impacts, traffic impacts, and
25 impacts to historical resources.
26 127. Respondents improperly exempted the Project from environmental review pursuant to
27 CEQA because the Project will have significant adverse environmental impacts, including, but not
28 limited to, air quality impacts, noise impacts, traffic impacts, and impacts to historical resources.
19

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

- 128.

2 Respondents improperly exempted the Project from environmental review pursuant to
the Historical Rehabilitation Exemption of CEQA Guidelines section 15331, which is limited to
3 maintenance, repair, stabilization, rehabilitation, restoration, preservation, conservation, or

4

5 reconstruction of historical resources in a manner consistent with the SOI Standards. Expert evidence

6 demonstrated that the Project was not consistent with the SOI Standards, including but not limited to

7 Standard Number 9 regarding the massing, size, and scale of the Project. Therefore, the Historical

8 Restoration Exemption does not apply on its own terms and Respondents abused their discretion and

9 failed to proceed in a manner required by law by exempting the Project from CEQA review pursuant to
the Historical Restoration Exemption.

10 129.

11 Respondents improperly exempted the Project from environmental review pursuant to
the Historical Rehabilitation Exemption of CEQA Guidelines section 15331, which is limited to
12 maintenance, repair, stabilization, rehabilitation, restoration, preservation, conservation, or

13

14 reconstruction of historical resources in a manner consistent with the SOI Standards. The Project is not

15 limited to mere maintenance, repair, stabilization, rehabilitation, restoration, preservation, conservation,

16 or reconstruction of historical resources in a manner consistent with the SOI Standards, but includes

17 construction of a large new hotel. As such, the Historical Rehabilitation Exemption does not apply on
its own terms.

18 130.

19 Respondents improperly exempted the Project from environmental review pursuant to

20 the Infill Exemption of CEQA Guidelines section 15332, which requires that any project subject to the

21 exemption must be "consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable general

22 plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and regulations." The Project is inconsistent

23 with numerous provisions of the General Plan, Zoning Code, and Downtown Specific Plan, including

24 but not limited to: the 15-foot setback requirement, the 3.0 floor area ratio limitation, General Plan

25 Policy HP-1.5, General Plan Policy HP-5, General Plan Objective LU-48, and Downtown Specific Plan

26 Policy LU 1.1. Therefore, the Infill Exemption does not apply on its own terms and Respondents

27 abused their discretion and failed to proceed in a manner required by law by exempting the Project
from CEQA review pursuant to the Infill Exemption.
28 131. Respondents improperly exempted the Project from environmental review pursuant to

20

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

-

2 the Infill Exemption of CEQA Guidelines section 15332, which prohibits exemption of a project from
CEQA review where project will result in significant effects related to air quality and noise. As a

3

4 result, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion because their decision is not supported by

5 substantial evidence and because they failed to proceed in a manner required by law, as follows:

A.

6 Air Quality. The City improperly exempted the Project from CEQA review
pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15332 as follows:

7 i.

8 The City failed to adequately evaluate, analyze, or mitigate the significant
impacts of the Project on air quality.

9 ii.

10 Expert evidence demonstrated that the Project's emissions would exceed

11 the South Coast Air Quality Management District's CEQA significance thresholds for construction

12 phase pollutants for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx).
iii.

13 Expert evidence demonstrated that the Project's construction emissions of

14 diesel particulate matter ("DPM") would result in an excess cancer risk for children and infants, at the

15 closest sensitive receptor located approximately 100 meters away, of approximately 47 and 43 in one

16 million, in excess of the South Coast Air Quality Management District's CEQA significance threshold
of 10 in one million.

17 iv.

18 Respondents abused their discretion and failed to proceed in a manner

19 required by law by exempting the Project from CEQA review despite the Project's significant air
impacts resulting from emissions of VOCs, NOx, and DPM, despite CEQA Guidelines section 15332's
20 prohibition on granting exemptions from CEQA review where a project will result in significant air
21 quality impacts.

22 B.

23 Indoor Air Quality. The City improperly exempted the Project from CEQA
review pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15332 as follows:

24 i.

25 The City failed to adequately evaluate, analyze, or mitigate the significant
impacts of the Project on indoor air quality.

26 ii.

27 Expert evidence demonstrates that the Project will have significant indoor
air quality impacts, exceeding applicable CEQA significance thresholds.

28

21

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

iii. The EIR impermissibly defers development of mitigation by failing to

2 propose specific feasible mitigation measures and environmentally superior alternatives for the Project's

3 significant indoor air quality impacts.

4 iv. Respondents abused their discretion and failed to proceed in a manner

5 required by law by exempting the Project from CEQA review despite the Project's significant indoor air

6 impacts resulting from emissions of formaldehyde, despite CEQA Guidelines section 15332's

7 prohibition on granting exemptions from CEQA review where a project has significant air quality

8 impacts.

C. Noise. The City improperly exempted the Project from CEQA review pursuant to
10 CEQA Guidelines section 15332 as follows:

11 i. The City failed to adequately evaluate, analyze, or mitigate the significant

12 impacts of the Project on noise.

13 ii. Expert evidence demonstrated that the City: (1) failed to utilize proper
14 metrics and failed to clearly establish existing baseline conditions to compare the Project's noise impacts

15 to the City's General Plan; (2) failed to address the Project's permanent increase in ambient noise; (3)
16 improperly relied on data from "similar projects" instead of conducting an analysis in accordance with

17 Caltrans, Federal Transit Administration (*FTA") and Federal Highway Administration ("FHWA")
18 guidance; and (4) failed to include noise and vibration impacts of impact/driven piles.

19 iii. Expert evidence demonstrated that there would be significant noise

20 impacts to the Life Art Center and First Congregational Church.

21 iv. Expert evidence demonstrated that the impact pile driving during

22 construction of the Project would result in significant noise impacts.

23 V. Respondents abused their discretion and failed to proceed in a manner
24 required by law by exempting the Project from CEQA review despite the Project's significant noise
25 impacts despite CEQA Guidelines section 15332's prohibition on granting exemptions from CEQA

26 review where project will result in significant noise impacts.
27

28

22

rified Petition for Writ of Mandate

- D.

2 Cumulative Impacts. Respondents abused their discretion and failed to proceed

3 in a manner required by law by failing to adequately disclose, evaluate, and mitigate the Project's
substantial adverse cumulative impacts.

4 E.

5 Mitigation Measures. Respondents abused their discretion and failed to proceed

6 in a manner required by law by exempting the Project from CEQA review while also requiring
mitigation for the Project's impacts to noise and historical resources.

7 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

8

9 Improper Granting of Variance
(Gov. Code § 65906)

10 132. (Code of Civil Procedure § 1085 or in the alternative §1094.5)

11 Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs, in

12 their entirety, as if fully set forth herein.

133.
13 Respondents improperly granted a variance for the Project to encroach 14 feet into the

14 required 15-foot setback because variances are only to be granted "when, because of special

15 circumstances applicable to the property, including size, shape, topography, location or surroundings,

16 the strict application of the zoning ordinance deprives such property of privileges enjoyed by other

17 property in the vicinity and under identical zoning classification." (Gov. Code, § 65906.)

134.
18 Respondents failed to provide substantial evidence that "special circumstances" were

19 applicable to the Project site and improperly considered the reduction of hotel rooms that would result

20 from adherence to the 15-foot setback requirement.

135.
21 Because no "special circumstances" are applicable to the Project site, Respondents

22 abused their discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law by granting the setback

variance.

23

24 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

25 WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests the following relief and entry of judgment as

follows:
26 1.
27 For a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents to:

- (a)

2 vacate and set aside Respondents' exemption of the Project from CEQA review

3 pursuant to CEQA Guidelines sections 15331 and 15332 on the grounds that adequate CEQA

4 compliance did not precede that action;
(b)

5 vacate and set aside Respondents' approval of the Project on the grounds that the

6 City improperly granted the setback variance;
(c)

7 comply with CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines prior to any subsequent action

8 taken to consider approval of the Project;

2.

9 For a temporary and permanent stay to prevent Respondents and Real Parties in Interest

10 from taking further actions to implement or proceed with the Project during the pendency of this

Dear Mayor Dawson, Riverside City Council, Riverside City Council, Ms. Gause, and
Ms. Norton:

Please take notice, pursuant to Public Resources Code 8 21167.5, that Petitioner
Supporters Alliance For Environmental Responsibility ("SAFER") intends to file a Verified Petition for Peremptory Writ of Mandate (*Petition") under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Pub.

Code § 21000 et seq., against the City of Riverside, Riverside City Council, and Riverside Planning Commission ("Respondents") and Real Party in Interest Greens Ehrenberg, LLC, challenging the City Council's November 16,
2021 decision to exempt the AC Marriott-Residence Inn Project (*Project") from CEQA under the Historic Resource Restoration/Rehabilitation Exemption (14 CCR § 15331) and Infill Exemption (14 CCR § 15332). Among other issues, Petitioner will allege that Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law exempting the Project from CEQA rather than preparing an environmental impact report ("EIR") or mitigated negative declaration ("MND").

The Petition will seek the following relief:
