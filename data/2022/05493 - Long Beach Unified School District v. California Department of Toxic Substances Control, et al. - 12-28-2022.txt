The DTSC's Prior CEQA Review for the Project ROMO CEQA Guidelines section 15003 sets forth a number of policies that courts have 10 32.

d 11 found to be implicit in CEQA, including: 8
12 "CEQA was intended to be interpreted in such a manner as to afford NOllväOdJOD 1VNOISSIJON anna 'VAOT 'NOST3GNY 'NOSNINIV +986-80206 VINàOSIIVO 'solaa3: the fullest possible protection to the environment within the MYTIV SAENJOLlY 13 reasonable scope of the statutory language.

15 "The lead agency must consider the whole of an action, not simply its constituent parts, when determining whether it will have 16 a significant environmental effect. (Citizens Assoc. For Sensible Development of Bishop Area v. County of Inyo (1985) 172 17 Cal.App.3d 151)" [emphasis added] (CEQA Guidelines 15003(h)).
Under CEQA, "lead agency" means "the public agency which has the principal
19 responsibility for carrying out or approving a project which may have a significant effect upon the 18 33.

20 environment." (Public Resources Code § 21067)

21 34. On or about August 13, 2019, the DTSC, as a CEQA lead agency, approved the

22 Project.

23 35. The Project is intended to address contaminated soil found on the City's
24 Warehouse Property and the District's Property.
25 36. CEQA defines "project" as:

26 "an activity which may cause either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in 27 the environment, and which is any of the following: (a) An activity directly undertaken by any public agency. (b) An activity 28 undertaken by a person which is supported, in whole or in part,

1 through contracts, grants, subsidies, loans, or other forms of
assistance from one or more public agencies. (c) An activity that 2 involves the issuance to a person of a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement for use by one or more public 3 agencies." (Public Resources Code § 21065)

4 37. Under CEQA, "[p]roject' is given a broad interpretation in order to maximize
5 protection of the environment." (McQueen v. Board of Directors, (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1136,

6 1143).

7 38. CEQA Guidelines section 15378(a) provides that "[p]roject' means the whole of

8 an action, which has a potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment,

9 ROMO or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment..."

10 39. Although the term "project" does not mean each separate governmental approval

•d 11 (CEQA Guidelines § 15378(c)), CEQA's "requirements cannot be avoided by chopping up ATKINSON, ANDELSON, LOYA, gnna § 12 proposed projects into bite-size pieces which, individually considered, might be found to have no

14 Council of Arcadia, (1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 712, 726).

15 40. On or about August 14, 2019, the DTSC filed a Notice of Exemption ("NOE") for
16 the Project with the Governor's Office of Planning and Research. A true and correct copy of the

17 NOE is attached hereto as Exhibit "C" and incorporated herein by reference.

18 41. The District is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the NOE was filed

19 by the DTSC pursuant to CEQA.

20 42. According to the NOE's "Project Description," the Project involves the approval of

21 a 2019 Remedial Action Plan ("2019 RAP") "for Avalon School Property [the District's Property]
22 and adjacent [City] Warehouse Property (both properties collectively referred to as the Site)."

23 43. The DTSC determined that the Project was exempt from CEQA pursuant to

24 CEQA's "common sense" exemption set forth in CEQA Guidelines section 15061(b)(3) which
25 provides that an activity is exempt from CEQA "[w]here it can be seen with certainty that there is
26 no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant effect on the environment.3

15 58. The District communication to the City and the DTSC included a May 5, 2022

17 "Waterstone's May 1, 2022, letter also indicates that "[t]he elevation

18 on the School Property will have raised to be match to the new grade on the Warehouse Property." [sic]. This is the first time the District

19 has received any information or notice regarding having to raise its property. As the City and Waterstone are aware, the District
20 installed a shotcrete V ditch to help its property mitigate the drainage and runon from the City property after removing the PAH
21 from the slope in 2009.[citation omitted] The District is also undergoing a modernization including a new artificial turf field. The
22 plans for this work have been reviewed by DSA and construction started 2022.

23 In addition, the City and Waterstone are aware that the District's
Fire Access Plan includes the evacuation of its students onto the

25 parallel along the South side of the City Warehouse. Any grade changes could impact egress for the island's students and

26 employees, which includes disabled individuals.

59. On June 30, 2022, the City provided to the District, for the first time, the City's

2 new cross section design plans, dated June 21, 2022. The new design depicted the regrading of
3 the Road Access Area and a new retaining wall resulting in a two and one-half foot drop from the

4 City's Warehouse Property to the District's Athletic Field Property. This height difference and

5 wall prohibit vehicles ingress to and egress from the District's Athletic Field Property. In addition
6 these plans include reducing the width of the access gate to a maximum width of 10 feet. The

7 access gate will also include a center pole that limits the gate access opening to less than five feet

8 on each side of the center pole. This will prohibit emergency vehicles and even a typical car from

9 gate to or from the Road Access Area. These changes in the Project ROMO passing through the access

17 of plans and lists, as part of the subcontractor's scope of work, the "drawings, and any additions or
18 modifications to those specifications and drawings, whether issued before or after the execution of

24 and the City. The new design detail in the plans depicts the regrading of the Road Access Area
25 and a new retaining wall resulting in a one foot and seven inch drop from the City's Warehouse
26 Property to the District's Athletic Field Property (a reduction in the previously planned two and

1 66. Under CEQA Guidelines section 15370, "Mitigation" includes:

2 "(a) Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action. 3 (b) Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation. 4 (c) Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the impacted environment. 5 (d) Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action. 6 (e) Compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute resources or environments, including through permanent protection 7 of such resources in the form of conservation easements."

8 67. The District contends that the changes in the Project would require mitigation (a
ROMO change in the elevation of the District's Property and a the need for a potential ramp to maintain
10| emergency vehicle access) to mitigate the potentially significant impacts to the environment.

MYT1Y SA3NJOLLY ILVJOd8OO 1VNOISSHJOde ATKINSON, ANDELSON, LOYA, RUUD § 12 means the whole of an action and CEQA's "requirements cannot be avoided by chopping up

19 69. On or about October 10, 2022, it became apparent to the District and the City that a
20 ramp would need to be constructed on the District's Property to retain emergency vehicular access

21 to the District's Property as a result of the City's changes to the Project.

22 70. In an email dated October 10, 2022, the City's legal counsel informed the District's
23| legal counsel that:
24 "Our engineers believe that a ramp is the only realistic means by which an access way can be provided, considering the necessary
25 requirements of the drainage controls that the District has demanded. We will have plans for such a ramp shortly and will give
26 the District an opportunity to comment on details…The costs of providing an access ramp are currently being included as part of the
27 entire remediation plan."

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

Since October 10, 2022, the City's legal counsel has informed the District's legal
2 counsel that the City would provide plans for the ramp. On October 17, 2022, the City's legal
counsel indicated that the plans for the ramp would be provided by the end of the month. On 71.

October 27, 2022, the City's legal counsel stated that the City "hoped to have preliminary plans
for the ramp within the next week or so, and we will share those with the District when they are
available." On November 11, 2022, the City's legal counsel wrote the District's legal counsel
informing him that the City would not construct the ramp to maintain emergency access. The
City's legal counsel went on to state "the District must be the entity that does that construction."

72. The District contends that the City's communications with respect to the ramp were Owod 10 only undertaken to allow the City's contractors to mobilize and complete their activities before the

11 District could obtain any relief to stop them. d

73. Although the District has demanded multiple times, as of the filing date of this 8 annx 'VAO] 'NOSTEONY 'NOSNIXIV 13 Petition, neither the DTSC nor the City has conducted CEQA review for the changes to the EEEE-ES9 (Z9S) +9€6-80206 VINJOIVO 'sold3 OZS-SS9 (79S) :3NOHd3131 MVTLY SAINJOLLY lVAOdHOO IVNOISS3JONd aLInS 'HINOS BAl8O I8NOD 83IN3O 008Zl 14 Project. The District believes and contends that the DTSC and the City are refusing to comply 12

15 with CEQA for the changes to the Project because if they did, they would be responsible for the
16 design and construction of a ramp that is needed to mitigate the impacts of the Project as revised.
17 By moving forward without any CEQA review, this cost will shift to the District, turning CEQA
18 on its head. The DTSC and the City must not be allowed to shift or eliminate their CEQA

19

The District believes and contends that the City's actions over the years show a 20

21 lack of good faith and fair dealing towards the District. This disregard for the District's rights, obligations in this manner.

22 became apparent again recently when the District became aware that the City was trespassing on 74.

23 the District's Property and removed a portion of the District's property to implement the Project.

24 The District was forced to send a cease and desist letter to the City on November 23, 2022. A true
and correct copy of the cease and desist letter is attached hereto as Exhibit "L." In the letter, the
26 District reiterated that the City was interfering with the District's easement rights, had failed to
27 comply with CEQA and was trespassing on the District's Property. The District demanded that 25

28 the City cease and desist all of its remediation activities immediately and if, if it did not, the

Project Description: The project involves the approval of a Remedial Action Plan (RAP) for Avalon School Property and adjacent Warehouse Property (both properties collectively referred to as the Site). The Remedial alternative selected in the RAP include excavation and offsite disposal of soil impacted with arsenic, lead, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and dioxins in the School Property and a cap over the southeast portion of the Warehouse Property Removal areas will be backfilled with clean soil and/or covered with hardscape.at the School Property to prevent direct contact to underlying soils. A Land Use Covenant (LUC) will be recorded to restrict future land uses and Soil Management Plan (SMP) will be prepared for future ground-breaking activities at the Site.
Background: The Site is approximately 12 acres and consists of the School Main Campus, designated as Operable Unit (OU-1), School Ball Field (OU-2A), and Warehouse Property (OU-2B). The School Main Campus and School Ball Field is approximately 11 acres in size and is owned by the Long Beach Unified School District (LBUSD). The Warehouse Property is owned by the City of Avalon (City), covers approximately one acre located to the northwest of the School Property, and currently contains two buildings and an outside storage area. A former electric power plant and portion of the manufactured gas plant (MGP) were previously located on the Warehouse Property.

The first documented development of the Site occurred in the upper portion of Falls Canyon in late 1919 with the construction of a MGP. MGP operation commenced in 1920 and ended in 1947 when the electric power plant was dismantled and removed. On the Warehouse Property, a former electric plant building was converted into a storage building. In 1920, Santa Catalina Island Company (SCICo) sold a portion of the Site to the City of Avalon, and in 1924 SCICo sold a portion of the Site to LBUSD. Later in 1924, development of the lower portion of Falls Canyon began with the construction of the first building for Avalon High School. In 1960, the western portion of the current School Property was acquired by LBUSD to construct a ball field. In 1978, LBUSD purchased a portion of an adjacent former golf course for use as elementary school portable classrooms.
During the summer of 2005 and 2006, approximately 7,000 cubic yards (cy) of soils impacted with lead, dioxins/furans, and arsenic in five areas at the Site were excavated and then stabilized and disposed of offsite.
Several investigations conducted at the Site indicate that soil was historically impacted by arsenic, lead, PAHs, and dioxins. The contaminants of concern (COCs) identified for each portion of the Site are described below.
OU-1: Dioxins were identified as COCs based on elevated concentrations in two samples. Lead was also identified as a COC based on the comparison of the Site data to the screening levels derived in the Human Health
Risk Assessment (HHRA) for students and workers. However, dioxins contribute the majority to the risk estimate.
OU-2A: Carcinogenic PAHs were identified as COCs and contribute the majority to the risk estimates based on elevated concentrations in soil samples.
OU-2B: Carcinogenic PAHs were identified as COCs based on elevated concentrations in soil samples.
OU-1, OU-2A, and OU-2B: Arsenic was identified as a Site-wide COC based on a comparison with background arsenic concentrations. The arsenic exceedances in soil were found in both surface and subsurface samples and occur sporadically throughout the Site.

Project Activities: The project activities consist of excavation up to 5-foot depth and disposal of approximately 475 cy of impacted soils at the School Property to meet the student remedial goal in soils, backfill to original depths with clean soil and/or hardscape over the removal areas at the School Property, a cap of approximately 7,500 square-feet over the southeast portion of the Warehouse Property, and institutional controls. Institutional controls would include restrictions on land use and activities at the Site and a site-specific Soils Management Plan (SMP).
During excavation activities, a rubber tire excavator with the capability of excavating soil and loading the soil directly into staged roll-off bins will be used. Soil will be directly loaded or staged then loaded into roll-off bins and temporarily staged onsite pending transportation and disposal to an appropriate off-island facility. The roll-off bins will be covered during transport to an off-site Class I landfill in Kettleman City, California for soil stabilization and disposal.
Dust control measures, such as soil wetting, will be implemented during soil excavation activities to reduce the potential to generate dust. Air monitoring will also be conducted for fugitive dust with fence line low flow pumps to monitor the effectiveness of dust control measures. Additionally, a low visibility/permeability wind screen will be placed to surround the excavation areas.

After excavation, 1-sack sand slurry backfill topped with clean soil and/or hardscape will be placed over the removal areas at the School Property and over the southeast portion of the Warehouse Property to prevent potential direct contact to remaining underlying soils. The 1-sack sand slurry is available on the island. A LUC will also be recorded to restrict future land uses in coordination with DTSC and a SMP will be prepared to manage any future ground-breaking activities at the Site.

Removal activities are of anticipated to be conducted in fall of 2019 over a one-month period during summer break when school classes are not in session.

The RAP iSs being implemented by GSI Environmental with DTSC oversight under an Imminent and Substantial
Endangerment Determination and Order and Remedial Action Order, Docket Number I/SED 11/12-003.
In the event biological, cultural or historical resources are discovered during project activities, work will be suspended while a qualified biologist or cultural or historical resource specialist assesses the area and arrangements are made to protect or preserve any resources that are discovered. If human remains are discovered, no further disturbance will occur in the location where the remains are found, and the County Coroner will be notified pursuant to the Health and Safety Code, Chapter 2, Section 7050.5

Exemption Title: Common Sense Exemption - Where it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant effect on the environment.
Reasons Why Project is Exempt: Previous remediation activities associated with approval of a previous RAP at the Site were analyzed for potential environmental impacts in an Initial Study/Negative Declaration (ISND) (SCH 2005069039) prepared by DTSC in June 2005. Remediation activities at the Site previously analyzed included excavation and offsite stabilization and disposal of soil impacted with lead, dioxins/furans, and arsenic in five areas across the existing Avalon School site, totaling approximately 7,000 cy. The previously excavated soils were transported and disposed of at the same Class I landfill in Kettleman City, California. The ISND determined that the previous project activities involving excavation and offsite disposal of contaminated soils would not result in any significant or potentially significant impacts requiring implementation of mitigation measures.
The proposed project activities would excavate and transport approximately 475 cy of contaminated soils which is significantly less than the 7,000-cy analyzed in the previous ISND. The proposed remediation activities (e.g., excavation equipment, techniques, and timing) are also substantially similar to those activities analyzed in the previous ISND. Based on the conclusions made in the previous ISND and the significantly smaller nature of remediation activities, project is considered to also result in no impacts or less-than-significant impacts. the proposed

Therefore, DTSC has determined witn certainty that there is no possibility that the actvities in question may have a significant effect on the environment because the project would not result in "a substantial, or potentially substantial, adverse change in any of the physical conditions within the area affected by the project, including land, air, water, minerals, flora, fauna, ambient noise, and objects of historic or aesthetic significance."
The project is consistent with applicable state and local environmental permitting requirements including, but not limited to, off-site disposal, air quality rules such as those governing volatile organic compounds and water quality standards, and approved by the regulatory body with jurisdiction over the site. Prior to implementing field activities, all necessary permits will be obtained from the County of Los Angeles, and South Coast Air Quality Management District.

RE: PRELIMINARY DESIGN OF PROPOSED SURFACE CAP AT THE CITY OF AVALON
WAREHOUSE PROPERTY (OU-2B), 661 FALLS CANYON ROAD, AVALON, CALIFORNIA

Dear Mr. Hwong:
Waterstone Environmental, Inc. (Waterstone) submits the attached preliminary design plan on behalf of the City of Avalon (Client) for the installation of a surface cap over an area of soil impacted with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at the above-referenced Subject
Property.

The purpose of the surface cap is to prevent or minimize human exposure, infiltration of water, and erosion of surface soil where concentrations of PAHs are present. This is consistent with the remedial objectives for the area for future commercial/industrial use of the Subject Property, to be stipulated in a land use covenant (LUC).
The capping-in-place alternative was proposed in Draft Remedial Action Plans (RAPs) in December 2018 and July 2019. Public notices were made in July 2019 and final approval was
issued by DTSC in August 2019.

Surface Cap Design
The cap is designed to effectively cover the area of PAHs in soil and support the anticipated use of the area for equipment storage. It is designed to direct stormwater runoff away from existing buildings and the neighboring K-12 school property (OU-2A) towards the south corner of the Warehouse property and Falls Canyon Creek drainage channel.
To prepare the area, a small (1,400 sf) existing concrete pad will be demolished, removed from the area, and transported offsite to a local crusher plant for recycling. A second existing concrete pad at the southern corner of the work area will remain.
Limited grading of near-surface soils will be performed to accommodate the concrete pad and raise the area along the school property boundary. A small amount of clean soil will be imported to establish the necessary surface grade and slope to facilitate proper drainage of the area. No waste soil or export soil is anticipated. A small retaining wall will be constructed along the

Page 2 of 2

school property boundary to contain stormwater on the City Warehouse property. A drainage swale on the pad will direct stormwater to the south corner of the property and to the Falls Canyon Creek drainage channel.
The cap will be constructed of concrete and will be divided into two components to ensure compliance with Water Quality Management Plan (WQMP) regulations: 1) 4,999 square feet of 6'-thick impervious concrete over the area of PAHs in soil next to the warehouse building; and 2) 2,501 square feet of 6.5'-thick pervious concrete extending from the corner of the warehouse building to the existing concrete pad at the southeast corner of the site.
Appropriate construction BMPs will be implemented during grading, compaction and paving activities to protect workers from potential exposures. BMPs may include dust monitoring, application of water as appropriate to limit dust, and ceasing activities if winds exceed 25 miles per hour during scheduled work periods.
Other elements of the final design package will include a cover sheet, demolition plan, an erosion control plan, and specifications/notes. Those are being finalized, but we wanted to provide this grading plan for your review and comments. A WQMP is not anticipated.

Please review this plan and provide any comments or questions at your earliest convenience.
Following your approval, the plans will be finalized and used for procurement of contractor bids. Please contact the undersigned at 714-414-1122 with any questions regarding this transmittal.

RE: RAP IMPLEMENTATION UPDATE FOR THE CITY OF AVALON WAREHOUSE PROPERTY
(OU-2B), 661 FALLS CANYON ROAD, AVALON, CALIFORNIA

Dear Mr. Hwong:
Waterstone Environmental, Inc. (Waterstone) makes this submittal to DTSC on behalf of the City of Avalon (Client) to provide an update on implementation of the RAP for the installation of
a surface cap at the above-referenced Subject Property. Attached for your review please find the most recent design plans for the surface cap. A copy of the schedule is also attached.
The purpose of the surface cap is to prevent or minimize human exposure, infiltration of water, and erosion of surface soil where concentrations of PAHs are present. This is consistent with the
remedial objectives for the area for future commercial/industrial use of the Subject Property, to be stipulated in a land use covenant (LUC). The capping-in-place alternative was proposed in Draft Remedial Action Plans (RAPs) in December 2018 and July 2019. Public notices were made in July 2019 and final approval was issued by DTSC in August 2019.

RAP Implementation

The design plans for the surface cap have been revised in response to comments from Hunsaker and Associates made on behalf of the Long Beach Unified School District (LBUSD). The goals of the design changes were to: (i) minimize the flow of surface water entering the school property during storm events; (ii) reduce the volume of water entering Falls Canyon Creek; and (iii) maintain emergency vehicle access between the school ballfield and the Warehouse
property.

This design directs water from the surface cap to a proposed sewer inlet structure in the southeast corner of the Warehouse Property near the existing wash pad and interceptor. A connection will be made to the existing sewer line such that the water will be directed to the City sewer system. This will decrease the volume of water that would otherwise enter the creek or that might flow onto the school property. Additional details have been obtained for the sewer system which have been incorporated into the plans.

Please review the plans and provide any comments or questions at your earliest convenience. These plans have been provided to the City of Avalon, Santa Catalina Island Company, and other interested parties for review; and will be used to procure the necessary permits for the construction. They will also be provided to contractors to request bids for construction of the surface cap. Field activities will begin once permits are approved and a contractor is retained.
We will continue with implementation of the RAP and move the project to completion as quickly as possible. Although the plans have taken a little longer to prepare than estimated, we are still working to meet the overall schedule of installing the surface cap in December 2021 and
January 2022.

RE: RAP IMPLEMENTATION UPDATE FOR THE CITY OF AVALON WAREHOUSE PROPERTY
(OU-2B), 661 FALLS CANYON ROAD, AVALON, CALIFORNIA

Dear Mr. Hwong:

Waterstone Environmental, Inc. (Waterstone) makes this submittal to DTSC on behalf of the City of Avalon (Client) to provide an update on implementation of the RAP for the installation of a surface cap at the above-referenced Subject Property.
The purpose of the surface cap is to prevent or minimize human exposure, infiltration of water, and erosion of surface soil where concentrations of PAHs are present. This is consistent with the
remedial objectives for the area for future commercial/industrial use of the Subject Property, to be stipulated in a land use covenant (LUC). The capping-in-place alternative was proposed in Draft Remedial Action Plans (RAPs) in December 2018 and July 2019. Public notices were made in July 2019 and final approval was issued by DTSC in August 2019.
The design directs water from the surface cap to a proposed sewer inlet structure in the southeast corner of the Warehouse Property near the existing wash pad and interceptor. A connection will be made to the existing sewer line such that the water will be directed to the City sewer system. This will decrease the volume of water that would otherwise enter the creek or that might flow onto the school property. The goals of the design are to: (i) minimize the flow of surface water entering the school property during storm events; (ii) reduce the volume of water entering Falls Canyon Creek; and (iii) maintain emergency vehicle access between the school ballfield and the Warehouse property.
RAP Implementation - Monthly Project Activities
Highlights of this Month's Activities
1. Comments to the design plans were received from City staff in preparation of obtaining the necessary permits for construction.
2. City staff completed a video inspection of the sewer and are trying to determine the details of the connection with the existing interceptor.

3. Construction proposals have been requested from construction contractors.

The City requested additional details of the existing sewer connection with the interceptor as well as the proposed connection for the drain inlet from the cap area in response to Waterstone's remediation plans and prior to issuing a permit for the work. Because there were no existing as- built drawings or other records available in the City's files, a physical inspection is required to determine these details. The video inspection conducted by the City provided some but not all of the information needed to reveal the engineering details of the interceptor.
Next Month's Project Activities
The City staff has proposed performing a further inspection of the sewer and interceptor to gather those details; however, it is not clear that will be sufficient. It may be necessary to expose the sewer/interceptor connection by potholing the area to obtain the details necessary for the required plan information requested by the City. Given the heavy rains in December, the City personnel have been busy keeping the storm sewers flowing, but are now able to perform the remaining inspections necessary for this project. The City personnel have committed to performing this work in January and we are hopeful they can complete the inspections and any necessary potholing needed during the month. Once we have this information, we can finalize revisions to our plans and obtain our permit from the City to begin construction.
Joe, please let me assure you that everyone involved in this project understands the importance of getting the cap completed on the Warchouse property as soon as possible. We are working with the City to expedite their work and are hopeful that no new storms will delay obtaining the engineering information we need to obtain. We are very close to scheduling a start date for field activities and will do so as soon as the final plans are approved and permits procured.
will contact you tomorrow to discuss this letter and our progress on the project. Please contact the undersigned at 714-414-1122 with any questions regarding this transmittal.

Dear Mr. Hwong:
Waterstone Environmental, Inc. (Waterstone) makes this submittal to DTSC on behalf of the City of Avalon and the Santa Catalina Island Company to provide an update on implementation of the RAP at the City Warehouse property.
The purpose of the surface cap is to prevent or minimize human exposure, infiltration of water, and erosion of surface soil where concentrations of PAHs are present. This is consistent with the remedial objectives for the area for future commercial/industrial use of the Subject Property, to be stipulated in a land use covenant (LUC).

RAP Implementation - Monthly Project Activities
Highlights of this Month's Activities
The following is an update of activities since our last update.
1. The plans were updated with the additional survey data provided by City staff.

Avalon Warehouse Property, OU-2B
March 30, 2022
Page 2 of 3

2. Changes to the design plans were made based on the new sewer and survey information and were provided to City staff for final review and approvals. Approval will be in the form of the necessary building and/or construction permits.
3. Samples were collected from a stockpile of crushed miscellaneous base (CMB) material at Jordahl Construction's equipment yard for potential import to the site. The samples were submitted for laboratory analysis of TPH, VOCs, SVOCs/PAHs, Title 22 metals, pesticides, herbicides, PCBs, and asbestos. The results received to date are below published screening levels and acceptable for commercial/industrial land use. Results are pending for one final waste extraction test (WET)/soluble threshold limit concentration (STLC) analysis. A memo detailing the results is attached to this letter for your review
and approval.
4. The City is planning to remove the existing equipment and storage items in the work area in anticipation of demolition activities. Currently, they are evaluating where they can relocate the items stored in the work area. Some of these items are smaller pieces of
equipment that can easily be relocated and others are portions of floating harbor docks that are large, difficult to move, and occupy a lot of space. The City understands that these items need to be removed prior to the initiation of construction and are doing their
utmost to complete this task so that we can begin construction.
5. We are working with Jim Hoffman of Jordahl Construction (the only construction company on the island and the company that performed the School site project) to schedule this project. We will initiate demolition activities as soon as Jordahl Construction advises us that construction personnel are available for this project and as
soon as DTSC approves the fill material.

Next Month's Project Activities
1. The City will arrange for the removal of equipment and other items stored in the work area to prepare the area for demolition activities.
2. We will be working with Jim Hoffman of Jordahl to commence the demolition portion of
the work on the Warehouse property.
3. We will work with DTSC to make sure that the import soil is appropriate for the site.
Joe, we've made considerable progress under difficult circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing labor shortages to get the construction portion of this job started. We expect the construction work to begin in April. We will notify you of the start date in case the DTSC wishes
to be present.

1. INTRODUCTION: All Waterstone Environmental, Inc. ("Waterstone") subcontracts include the following Terms and Conditions which establish the general scope of liability and responsibility that governs the Subcontract Agreement and all work authorizations resulting therefrom. Capitalized terms not defined in these Terms and Conditions have the meanings ascribed to them in the Subcontract Agreement.
2. INVOICING: All Subcontractor invoices must be submitted to the following address to be
considered for payment.

Waterstone Environmental, Inc.
Attn: Accounts Payable 2936 East Coronado Street
Anaheim, California 92806
Payment will be made in accordance with these Terms and Conditions, subject to the submission of the "conditional" lien releases covering the work invoiced and an "unconditional" lien release for all invoices
previously paid.
The Subcontract Agreement will define the project costing as either Time-and-Materials or Fixed Fee. Invoices shall be submitted one week after project completion. For projects exceeding thirty (30) days in duration, invoices will be issued monthly. Monthly invoices will be submitted to Waterstone based upon the total costs expended for personnel, equipment and supplies within the time period covered by the monthly invoice.
Time-and-Material Invoices will be issued to Waterstone in a format which will itemize labor expended by skill category, individual and hourly rate, along with the material, equipment, supplies, subcontracted services, travel, and other expenses incurred directly in the performance of the services provided. All labor and expenses incurred shall be invoiced and reimbursed as set forth in the Subcontractor Billing Rate Schedule attached to the Subcontract Agreement, unless otherwise stated in the proposal.
Fixed Fee Invoices will be issued to Waterstone in a format that describes the work completed within the billing period and provides an estimate of the percent completion of the project.
3. TAXES: Prices, rates, and estimates provided hereunder are exclusive of any federal, state, local or municipal sales, use, or excise taxes on the services or equipment delivered hereunder, which if applicable are the sole and exclusive responsibility of Subcontractor.
4. EXISTING SITE CONDITION AND ACCESS: CLIENT has granted Waterstone and its subcontractors, including Subcontractor, access and authority to enter the Site to fulfill the scope of services. CLIENT acknowledges that Waterstone and its subcontractors did not create any hazardous waste, pollution sources, nuisance, or chemical or industrial disposal problem, if any, which may existat the Site. The responsibility for making any disclosures or reports to any third party and for taking corrective, remedial, or mitigative action, including disposal of any materials, shall be solely that ofthe

Subcontract Terms and Conditions Page 2 of 6

CLIENT and/or property owner, unless otherwise specified by Waterstone. Subcontractor will take reasonable precautions to minimize damage to the Site and adjoining properties.

5. INDEMNITY: Subcontractor shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Waterstone and its officers, directors, employees, agents, shareholders, legal representatives, affiliates, successors, and assigns, and each of them, from and against loss, liability, costs, damages, or expenses from all claims, actions, and suits, whether groundless or otherwise, and from and against all claims, liabilities, judgments, losses, damages, costs, charges, attorney's fees, expert and consultant costs, court costs, the costs of Waterstone's or a third party's personnel assigned to assist and manage any remedial measures or defense, and other expenses of every nature and character arising from or in any way related to: (a) any negligence or willful misconduct of Subcontractor or any of its agents, employees, officers, or independent contractors; (b) any breach or default by Subcontractor in the performance of any obligation to be performed by Subcontractor, or breach of any representation or warranty of Subcontractor; (c) all waste removal assistance rendered by Waterstone to the extent Waterstone followed, or provided a
subcontractor to follow, the current established waste removal practices applicable in the locality in which the services are being rendered; (d) any misrepresentations by Subcontractor that result in the improper disposition of a hazardous substance; (e) the services performed by Subcontractor and any activity, work or thing done or permitted by Subcontractor or any agent, employee, officer, or independent contractor of or retained by Subcontractor, including, without limitation, liability of Subcontractor arising under any workers' compensation act, any employer liability law or other law applicable to Subcontractor's personnel; (f) any failure by Subcontractor, or any tier of contractor below Subcontractor, to pay wages, fringe benefits, or other benefit payment or contributions, or interest owed thereon, or (g) Subcontractor's non-compliance with environmental laws.
6. REMEDIES: Subcontractor acknowledges and agrees that the terms, covenants, and agreements set forth in these Terms and Conditions are reasonable and necessary for the protection of Waterstone's business interests, that irreparable injury will result to Waterstone if Subcontractor breaches any of these Terms and Conditions, and that in the event of an actual or threatened breach by Subcontractor of these Terms and Conditions, Waterstone may have no adequate remedy at law. Subcontractor accordingly agrees that in the event of any actual or threatened breach of any of the provisions contained in the Subcontract Agreement or these Terms and Conditions, Waterstone is entitled to apply for injunctive and other equitable relief without the requirement or necessity of showing actual damages or showing that monetary damages are an inadequate remedy. Nothing contained in this Section will be construed as prohibiting or limiting Waterstone from pursuing any other remedies available to it for a breach or threatened breach relating to the Subcontract Agreement or these Terms and Conditions, including the recovery of any damages. All rights and remedies provided for in these Terms and Conditions are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies that may be available to Waterstone, whether provided by law, equity, statute, in any other agreement between the parties, or
otherwise.

7. STANDARD OF SERVICES AND WARRANTY: Services performed by Subcontractor under
the Subcontract Agreement and these Terms and Conditions shall be conducted a in a manner consistent
with that level of care and skill ordinarily exercised by members of the same profession currently
practicing in the same locality under similar conditions. Subcontractor warrants that if any of its completed products or services fail to conform to this professional standard, Subcontractor will, at its own expense, perform corrective services as may be reasonably required to correct such defects.

8. NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT: Subcontractor shall keep confidential all Waterstone
furnished CLIENT data and reports generated hereunder, as well as information, observations, and data concerning the business or affairs of Waterstone obtained by Subcontractor, including all current,

Subcontract Terms and Conditions Page 3 of 6

future, or proposed products or services, trade secrets, processes, technology, designs, methodologies, specifications, operating methods, know-how, reports, templates, improvements, technical data, research, programs, licenses, codes, suppliers, business opportunities, personnel, compensation information related to Waterstone employees and independent contractors, pricing information, financial information, marketing information, client names, customer lists, vendor lists, business forecasts, business relationships, copyrights, patents, and trademarks (whether registered or not), regardless of whether the information is designated as "confidential". Subcontractor will not disclose such information to any third parties without Waterstone's written authorization and will not use such information for any purpose unrelated to its work under the Subcontract Agreement and these Terms and Conditions. Subcontractor will not have liability to Waterstone under this Section for any information that was in the public domain at the time it was disclosed to Subcontractor.

9. RIGHTS IN DATA: Any reports, documents or findings that are presented or delivered to Waterstone in complete or partial fulfillment of this agreement shall become the property of Waterstone. Subcontractor agrees that any patentable or copyrightable concepts, data or software developed by Subcontractor or Waterstone as a direct or indirect consequence of services rendered by Subcontractor or Waterstone hereunder are the sole and exclusive property of Waterstone.
10. CHANGES: Waterstone may at any time, by written order, and within the general scope of the
Subcontract Agreement, make changes to the services called for thereunder, or under the Terms and Conditions. If any such change causes an increase or decrease in the cost of, or the time required for, the performance of any part of the work under the Subcontract Agreement or these Terms and Conditions, an equitable adjustment may be made in the contract price or delivery schedule, or both, and the Subcontract Agreement and these Terms and Conditions, as applicable, will be modified in writing accordingly. In addition, Subcontractor may be entitled to an equitable adjustment for any changed conditions, delays, or directions by Waterstone which cause an increase to the cost of or the time required for the performance of any part of the work under the Subcontract Agreement or these Terms and Conditions, as directed in writing by Waterstone. Subcontractor shall submit claim for adjustment under this clause within thirty (30) days from the date the change notification was received from CLIENT or from the date Subcontractor first had knowledge of the change in order to be considered by Waterstone. If instructed by Waterstone, Subcontractor shall perform the changed work while a mutually agreeable adjustment is reached and executed in writing by both Waterstone and Subcontractor. Failure to reach a mutual agreement on any adjustment hereunder after good faith efforts to do So shall constitute a dispute under Paragraph 13 of these Terms and Conditions.
11. DELAYS/FORCE MAJEURE: Neither party shall be deemed in default of the Subcontract Agreement or these Terms and Conditions to the extent that any delay or failure in the performance of its obligations results from any causes beyond its reasonable control and without its fault or negligence. Examples of such causes include, but are not limited to (1) Acts of God or the public enemy, (2) Acts of the Government in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, (3) fires, (4) floods, (5) epidemics, (6) quarantine restrictions, (7) strikes, (8) embargoes, (9) earthquakes, and (10) unusually severe weather.
12. TERMINATION: Either Subcontractor or Waterstone may terminate the Subcontract
Agreement, including these Terms and Conditions, without cause and for its own convenience given ten (10) days written notice to the other party. The Subcontract Agreement, including these Terms and Conditions, will terminate automatically upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of either party. Upon termination of the Subcontract Agreement for any reason, Subcontractor shall promptly deliver to Waterstone all notebooks, computer software, documents, lists, memoranda, reports, files, correspondence, compilations and similar items from whatever source derived, samples and any and all

Subcontract Terms and Conditions Page 4 of 6

other property belonging to Waterstone or in any way relating to Waterstone's business, which are in
Subcontractor's possession or control.
In the event of termination for any reason the parties shall enter into good faith negotiations to arrive at a fair and reasonable quantification of liabilities. Failure to agree on such a quantification of liability shall be deemed a dispute under Paragraph 13 of these Terms and Conditions.
13. DISPUTES: All claims, disputes, and other matters in question between the parties arising out of or relating to the Subcontract Agreement or these Terms and Conditions, or any performance or nonperformance under these agreements, shall be addressed in the following manner:
Mediation: Other than claims by Waterstone for injunctive relief the parties shall first mediate such dispute before commencement of any legal action, including arbitration. No party can bring legal action against another party to this agreement without first requesting mediation, unless one party refuses to submit to mediation, or fails to respond to a written request for mediation within thirty (30) days of such request. The mediator's charges and expenses shall be split equally by the parties. Each party shall be responsible for his or her own attorney fees and costs at mediation. Those costs may not be assessed against the other party if the other party is the prevailing party. If the dispute cannot be resolved at mediation either party may then proceed to arbitration as provided herein.
Arbitration: In the event matter cannot be resolved pursuant to the mediation requirements of this Section, any dispute or controversy arising out of, or relating to, the Subcontract Agreement or these Terms and Conditions, the parties hereby agree to submit such dispute or controversy to arbitration. The sole arbitrator shall be selected from the list (the "List") of arbitrators supplied by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Orange County, California office, or any successor entity, or if it no longer exists, from a List supplied by the American Arbitration Association (collectively, "JAMS") following written request by any party hereto. If the parties hereto, after notification of the other party(ies) to such dispute, cannot agree upon an arbitrator within thirty (30) days following receipt of the List by all parties to such arbitration, then either party may request, in writing, that JAMS appoint an arbitrator within ten (10) days following receipt of such request (the "Arbitrator"). The arbitration shall take place in Orange County, California, at a place and time mutually agreeable to the parties, or if no such agreement is reached within ten (10) days following notice from the Arbitrator, at a place and time determined by the Arbitrator. The parties hereto agree that all actions or proceedings arising in connection with the Subcontract Agreement or these Terms and Conditions shall be arbitrated exclusively in Orange County, California. The aforementioned choice of venue is intended by the parties to be mandatory and not permissive in nature, thereby precluding the possibility of litigation between the parties with respect to or arising out of the Subcontract Agreement or these Terms and Conditions in any jurisdiction other than that specified in this Section. Each party hereby waives any right it may have to assert the doctrine of forum non conveniens or similar doctrine or to object to venue with respect to any proceeding brought in accordance with this Section, and stipulates that the Arbitrator shall have in personam jurisdiction and venue over each of them for the purpose of litigating any dispute, controversy, or proceeding arising out of or related to the Subcontract Agreement or these Terms and Conditions. Each party hereby authorizes and accepts service of process sufficient for personal jurisdiction in any action against it as contemplated by this Section by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to its address as set forth in the Subcontract Agreement or these Terms and Conditions. The decision of the Arbitrator shall be final and binding on all the parties to the arbitration and may be enforced by a court of competent jurisdiction. The costs and fees of the arbitration shall be split equally by the parties. Each party shall be responsible for his or her own attorney's fees and costs at arbitration. The Arbitrator may grant any remedy appropriate including, without limitation, injunctive relief or specific performance. Prior to the

Subcontract Terms and Conditions Page 5 of 6

appointment of the Arbitrator, any party may seek temporary equitable or injunctive relief from the Orange County Superior Court which shall be effective until a final decision is rendered by the Arbitrator.

14. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR: Subcontractor is, and shall perform its services under the
Subcontract Agreement and these Terms and Conditions as, an independent contractor and not as the Waterstone's agent, partner, or joint venture. Subcontractor is engaged to render professional services only, and any payments made by Waterstone are compensation solely for such services rendered. Waterstone cannot sign waste manifests on behalf of Subcontractor and only the CLIENT can direct the
disposition of CLIENT's hazardous waste. Further, Subcontractor represents and warrants that at all
times during the term of the Subcontract Agreement, and while it is performing work under the Subcontract Agreement, each of the following is true and correct relating to Subcontractor: (i) it is licensed by the Contractors State License Board, and the work it will perform under the Subcontract Agreement is within the scope of that license; (ii) it holds any and all business licenses and tax
registrations required by law; (iii) it maintains a business location that is separate from Waterstone's business location and the location of the Site; (iv) it has the authority to hire and fire other persons to provide or to assist in performing its work, subject to any limitations identified in the Subcontract
Agreement regarding the performance or assumption of Subcontractor's obligations; (v) it assumes
financial responsibility for errors and omissions in its work; (vi) it is customarily engaged in an independently established business of the same nature as that involved in the work to be performed.
15. REQUESTS FOR PAYROLL AND PROJECT INFORMATION: Subcontractor and its sub- subcontractors shall keep accurate payroll records containing information sufficient to apprise Waterstone of Subcontractor's and respective sub-subcontractor's payment status in making payment of wages, fringe benefits, or other benefit payments or contributions to a third a party on behalf of
Subcontractor's employees and Subcontractor's employees and sub-subcontractors' employees, respectively ("Payroll Records"). Subcontractor and its sub-subcontractors shall also keep certain project award information, including: project name; name and address of Subcontractor; hiring party; anticipated start date; duration of performance; estimated journeyman and apprentice hours; and, the contact information for each subcontractor on the project ("Project Information"). Upon Waterstone's written request, which request may be made any number of times and at Waterstone's sole discretion, Subcontractor must provide to Waterstone (i) the Payroll Records, which Waterstone may require to be certified under penalty of perjury, along with an affirmative Statement of Non-Performance of Work, if no labor or work was performed for a specific week, and (ii) the Project Information, within ten (10) days of the date of Waterstone's written request for same. Subcontractor acknowledges that the obligations
set forth in this Section are material obligations, and that performance of these obligations is a condition
precedent to Subcontractor being paid.
16. NO ATTORNEY'S FEES: In the event of any action (including, without limitation, mediation or arbitration) arising out of or relating to the Subcontract Agreement or these Terms and Conditions, or otherwise relating to Subcontractor's or Waterstone's performance thereunder, each party shall bear its own attorney's fees and costs in connection with such action.

17. CONFORMANCE WITH LAW: The validity, performance and construction of this agreement shall be governed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the state of California.

18. ASSIGNMENT: There shall be no assignment of the rights or obligations in the Subcontract
Agreement or these Terms and Conditions by Subcontractor without the written consent of Waterstone and any assignment absent such consent shall be null and void and shall render the corresponding duties and obligations of the other party null and void. Waterstone may assign its rights and obligations upon
notice to Subcontractor.

Subcontract Terms and Conditions Page 6 of 6

19. ENTIRE AGREEMENT: The Subcontract Agreement with attached exhibits along with these Terms and Conditions contain the entire agreement and understanding between the parties hereto with respect to the subject services and shall not be varied in its terms by any previous communications, negotiations and agreements, whether oral or written, between the parties with respect to such subject matter, and no addition to or modification or waiver of any provision of the Subcontract Agreement, or
these Terms and Conditions, shall be binding on either party unless made in writing and executed by
Waterstone and a duly authorized agent of Subcontractor. If any of the Subcontract Agreement provisions or provisions in these Terms and Conditions conflict with contract provisions or terms and conditions provided by Subcontractor, Waterstone's Subcontract Agreement provisions and these
Terms and Conditions shall prevail. If any portion of the Subcontract Agreement or these Terms and
Conditions is held invalid or unenforceable, any remaining portion shall continue in full force and effect.

20. ACCEPTANCE: The Subcontract Agreement with the attached exhibits, along with these Terms
and Conditions, become a binding contract on the terms set forth herein when the Subcontract Agreement
is executed by Waterstone and Subcontractor.

21. INTERPRETATION: Each party has either revised or been given the opportunity to revise the Subcontract Agreement and these Terms and Conditions, and the rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party is not to be employed in the interpretation of the documents. As used in these Terms and Conditions, the masculine, feminine, or neutral gender, and the singular or plural number, include the others whenever the context so indicates. The use of "including" is for purposes of example or illustration, and not for purposes of restriction or limitation. The section headings appearing in these Terms and Conditions are for convenience of reference only and are not intended to limit or define the text of any article, section, subsection, or paragraph.

Avalon, CA 90704

Re: 200 Falls Canyon Rd., Avalon, CA 90704: Cease and Desist Letter (Trespass,
Interference with Easement, Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act)

Dear Ms. Hart:

Our firm, Atkinson, Andelson, Loya, Ruud & Romo (the "Firm") represents Long Beach Unified School District ("District"). The District's Avalon K-12 School Campus is located at 200 Falls Canyon Road, Avalon, California 90704, property commonly known as Assessor's Parcel Number ("APN") 7480-002-907 ("District's Property"). Recently, as you are aware, the City of Avalon (*City") began environmental remediation work (the "Work") at the City's warehouse property located at 661 Falls Canyon Rd., Avalon California 90704, commonly known as APN 7480-002-905 ("City's Property").
It has come to the District's attention that the City's Work: has resulted in trespass upon the District's Property; is interfering with a District easement on the City's Property; and, is being implemented without compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). The District hereby formally demands that the City cease and desist its Work as set forth in this
letter.

Entering and utilizing any portion of the District's Property without the District's consent constitutes trespass under the law. Entry onto property is defined to include not only coming onto the land but also placing an object onto the property of another. The District is aware that City employees and/or consultants have and are continuing to trespass on the District's Property by: performing the Work on the District's Property; placing materials on the District's Property; and, physically altering the District's Property (at a minimum, by digging trenches on the District's Property).

As you are aware, the District is the owner of an easement that burdens the City's Property and provides ingress to and egress from the District's Property, including emergency vehicle access. The City's Work, including the regrading of the City's Property and the construction of a retaining wall at or near the property boundary line between City's Property and the District's Property, will create a two and one-half foot drop from the City's Property to the District Property where vehicles ingress to and egress from the District's Property. The City's Work will eliminate vehicular access to the District's Property, including, but not limited to, emergency
vehicular access, and will substantially impair the Los Angeles County, State of California and
other emergency response on the District's Athletic Field. In addition, the City's Work will
impair District emergency evacuation plans for the District's Avalon K-12 School Campus.
The City's Work is unlawful and interfering with the District's lawful use and enjoyment of its easement. The City's attorney, David Wood, recognized this when he wrote to the District on October 10, 2022, informing of the City's intent to construct a ramp' a on District property when he stated "Construction of the ramp would of course include the need to access portions of the school property. If, after the District reviews these plans, it declines to approve them or refuses to allow necessary access to school property in order to construct the ramp, we would have to consider such an action a waiver of any claimed access rights."
Finally, the regrading of the City's Property and the construction of a retaining wall at or near the property boundary line between City's Property and the District's Property resulting in a two a and one-half foot drop from the City's Property to the District Property has not been analyzed under
CEQA.

The District hereby formally demands that the City cease and desist its Work immediately. Please be aware that this letter constitutes formal notice of the City's current acts of trespass and
interference with the District's easement and to any subsequent or future acts of trespass or
interference with the District's easement.

Please contact the Firm to confirm receipt and understanding of this letter by 5:00 p.m. on Monday, November 28, 2022. The District hopes to maintain a collegial relationship with the City as neighboring property owners. However, if the Firm does not hear from you by 5:00 p.m. on Monday, November 28, 2022, the District will file a lawsuit to enforce CEQA and the District's rights to the fullest extent of law.

On November 11, 2022, the City's attorney, David Wood, wrote the District informing that the City will not construct the ramp to maintain emergency access. Mr. Wood went on to state "the District must be the entity that does that construction" and has told the District since October 10, 2022, that the City would provide plans for this ramp. On October 17, 2022, David Wood indicated the plans for the ramp would be provided by the end of the month. On October 27, 2022, Mr. Wood stated in his email that the City "hoped to have preliminary plans for the ramp within the next week or so, and we will share those with the District when they are available."
